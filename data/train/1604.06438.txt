    "we consider evolutionary social dilemmas on either the scale - free or the erds - rnyi random network ( see methods for details ) , or on interaction networks with a uniform degree distributions , such as the random regular graph and the square lattice , where each player @xmath0 is initially designated either as cooperator ( @xmath1 ) or defector ( @xmath2 ) with equal probability .",
    "each instance of the game involves a pairwise interaction where mutual cooperation yields the reward @xmath3 , mutual defection leads to punishment @xmath4 , and the mixed choice gives the cooperator the sucker s",
    "payoff @xmath5 and the defector the temptation @xmath6 .",
    "we predominantly consider the weak prisoner s dilemma , such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but we also consider the true prisoner s dilemma where @xmath10 .",
    "the standard monte carlo simulation procedure comprises the following elementary steps .",
    "first , according to a random sequential update protocol , a randomly selected player @xmath0 acquires its payoff @xmath11 by playing the game with all its neighbors .",
    "next , player @xmath0 randomly chooses one neighbor @xmath12 , who then also acquires its payoff @xmath13 in the same way as previously player @xmath0 . to avoid payoff - related effects that are due to heterogeneous interaction topologies @xcite , we normalize the payoff with the degree of the corresponding player @xmath14 . after",
    "both players acquire their payoffs , player @xmath0 adopts the strategy @xmath15 from player @xmath12 with a probability determined by the fermi function @xmath16 where @xmath17 quantifies the uncertainty related to the strategy adoption process @xcite . in agreement with previous works , the selected value ensures that strategies of better - performing players are readily adopted by their neighbors , although adopting the strategy of a player that performs worse is also possible @xcite .",
    "this accounts for imperfect information , errors in the evaluation of the opponent , and similar unpredictable factors .    to introduce conformity",
    ", we designate a fraction @xmath18 of the population as being conformity - driven , which influences the strategy adoption rule . instead of eq .",
    "[ fermi ] , if player @xmath0 is a conformist , we use @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of players adopting strategy @xmath21 within the interaction range of player @xmath0 , while @xmath22 is one half of the degree of player @xmath0 . by using eq .",
    "[ conform ] , player @xmath0 is most likely to adopt the strategy that is , at the time , the most common in its neighborhood . as in eq .",
    "[ fermi ] , here too @xmath17 introduces some uncertainty to the process , such that it is not completely impossible for a conformist to adopt a strategy that is in the minority among its neighbors . if , however , the number of cooperators and defectors in the neighborhood is equal , the conformity - driven player will change its strategy with probability @xmath23",
    "we also emphasize that , in this study , a conformist uses only local information .",
    "in particular , a conformity - driven player simply tends to follow the majority in its local neighborhood .",
    "an alternative approach might entail a conformist having available global information about the whole population and act accordingly .",
    "in such a case , however , the global information may likely suppress the vital importance of local information stemming from the direct neighbors .",
    "due to several open questions and options on implementation , we leave it to future studies to determine the merits of global conformity .",
    "a key consideration in this paper is which players make up the fraction @xmath18 of the population that act as conformists .",
    "we consider and compare several different options .",
    "the simplest option is to assign conformists uniformly at random , which we use as the benchmark case .",
    "secondly , on heterogeneous interaction networks , such as scale - free and erds - rnyi random networks , we use the degree @xmath24 of each player , whereby the probability to be designated as a conformist can be either @xmath25 or @xmath26 for degree - related or inversely - degree - related assignment , respectively . in the former case , high - degree players , i.e. , the hubs or leaders , most certainly end up as conformists , while in the latter case low - degree players , i.e. , the masses or the periphery , are the most likely conformists .",
    "thirdly , again of relevance on heterogeneous networks , we use the concept of collective influence of players to distinguish them @xcite .",
    "in particular , we calculate the collective influence @xmath27 at depth @xmath28 for every player @xmath0 ( see @xcite for details ) , where the maximal value is @xmath29 .",
    "the incentive for player @xmath0 to act as a conformist is then simply based on the ratio @xmath30 .",
    "accordingly , players with the highest collective influence at depth @xmath28 in the network will most likely end up using eq .",
    "[ conform ] rather than eq .",
    "[ fermi ] for the strategy adoption . in principle",
    ", this approach is the same as the degree - related assignment of conformity , in that the leaders are the likeliest to conform .",
    "lastly , we check our observations on homogeneous networks , where all players have an identical number of neighbors . instead of considering topological differences , we thus assign a different strategy pass capacity @xmath31 to each player as a pre - factor in eq .",
    "[ fermi ] @xcite , such that the distribution is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] interval .",
    "this practically means that the majority of the players has a very low @xmath31 value , while only a few have @xmath34 ( the distribution is shown in the inset of fig .  [ sqr ] ) . as with the degree",
    ", we consider @xmath35-related ( the probability is simply equal to @xmath31 because @xmath36 ) or inversely-@xmath35-related ( 1-@xmath31 ) assignment of conformity , such that the leaders or the masses are preferentially considered as conformists , respectively .",
    "we begin by presenting the main results on scale - free networks in fig .",
    "[ sf ] , where we show how the fraction of cooperators ( @xmath37 ) in the stationary state depends on the fraction @xmath18 of the whole population that is made up of conformist players . as stated in the introduction",
    ", these players do not aspire to maximal payoffs as is traditionally assumed in evolutionary games , but rather , they prefer to adopt the most common strategy within their interaction range . as we have reported in @xcite , when conformity is assigned randomly and to a sufficiently high fraction of the population , the spatial selection for cooperation is enhanced , and the level of cooperation in the stationary state is higher than in the absence of conformist players .",
    "results presented in fig .",
    "[ sf ] show , however , that this effect can be either enhanced or destroyed based on the preference of who will be made to conform . specifically , if conformists are players with a high degree or high collective influence in the network , the evolution of cooperation is significantly impaired .",
    "the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and coordination is almost completely lost .",
    "naturally , we can still observe a gradual increase of @xmath37 as the fraction of conformists increases , but this is just a simple consequence of the fact that we reach a strategy neutral state at @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , if conformists are preferentially selected from low - degree players , i.e. , from the masses , then an even higher level of cooperation in the stationary state is attainable , indicating an optimization of the aforementioned interplay .",
    "this result is intuitive and understandable , because high - degree players are naturally in a position to influence a large neighborhood , and the effectiveness of this influence is facilitated further if the neighborhood is made up predominantly of conformist players .",
    "this interplay of heterogeneity ( the ability of a small number of select players , i.e. , the leaders , having a wide influence ) and coordination ( the pressure of conformity to select the most common strategy , even if it is not payoff - maximizing ) ultimately leads to large homogenous groups or clusters competing in the population , which in the long - run reveals the benefits of cooperation by virtue of network reciprocity .",
    "naturally , this argument fails if leaders are made to conform because they then become unable to capitalize on their central position within the network . in the latter case",
    ", the coordination becomes less efficient , because players having the capacity to search for a more successful strategy are unable to lead others , which ultimately hinders the successful evolution of cooperation .",
    "these details of the described macroscopic dynamics are generally valid and apply regardless of the properties of the interaction network and game parametrization . indeed , as indicated by the results presented in fig .",
    "[ er ] , which were obtained on erds - rnyi random networks , it is better if conformists are selected specifically from those players who have lower degree or collective influence . on the contrary , if highly influential players are targeted as conformists and made to follow the majority , then the level of cooperation in the stationary state drops significantly .",
    "similarly , as evidenced by the results presented in fig .",
    "[ ts ] for both the scale - free ( left panel ) and erds - rnyi random ( right panel ) networks , even if the weak prisoner s dilemma game parametrization is replaced with the more stringent variant of the same social dilemma , the targeted selection of conformists amongst the masses still ensures high levels of cooperation in the stationary state .",
    "we note that , although the level of cooperation might appear to be modest at first , due to the application of degree - normalized payoffs , there would actually be almost no cooperators able to survive without the help of conformity in the considered @xmath39 range .",
    "previous research has also shown that , when we normalize payoffs on heterogeneous interaction network , we destroy the heterogeneity among players , which drastically weakens the positive impact of enhanced network reciprocity @xcite . while this argument is of course valid , it is nevertheless important to keep in mind that players are still different because of the remaining differences in degree , and the resulting diverse opportunities to spread their strategies .",
    "this difference can be revealed if we choose conformists selectively , by considering the individual differences of players . as we have shown , it is detrimental to force leaders into following their own neighborhood .",
    "we note that this observation remains valid even if we apply less realistic absolute payoff values to determine strategy imitation probabilities @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "expecting the same conformist attitude from the masses could be very useful for the whole population .",
    "this argument can be supported indirectly by considering also collective influence , as recently proposed in @xcite , instead of the degree . as can be observed in both figs .",
    "[ sf ] and [ er ] ( see label collective ) , exploiting the concept of collective influence to target the most influential players as conformists results in the same fall of cooperation as we have observed when high - degree players were made to conform .    however , it is also possible to verify the above described conclusion directly if we distinguish players on regular networks or lattices , of course not by means of their degree or collective influence ( because everybody has the same ) , but by means of their diverse capacities to pass strategy to the neighbors . in the latter case",
    "we apply a player specific prefactor @xmath35 to eq .",
    "[ fermi ] which characterizes how successfully a player can deliver a strategy to the other player @xcite . to that effect , we assume that the strategy pass capacity distribution in the population is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] interval , as show in the inset of fig .  [ sqr ] .",
    "this practically means that all players have a minimal chance to spread their strategy ( hence we avoid frozen states ) , but only a small fraction of the population has @xmath34 . in this context",
    "the former players are the masses , while the later players are the more influential leaders .",
    "evidently , we can select conformist preferably among the high-@xmath35 players ( high in fig .",
    "[ sqr ] ) or among the low-@xmath35 players ( low in fig .",
    "[ sqr ] ) .",
    "as expected , for small and high @xmath18 values there is no relevant differences between the two selection rules . in the former case",
    "the impact of conformist players is negligible , while in the latter case it is too strong ( a strategy neutral state is reached at @xmath38 ) , either way precluding the observation of notable differences . in the intermediate region , however , we can see that higher cooperation levels can be obtained if conformity - driven players are chosen from low-@xmath35 group . in other words",
    ", it is better to allow leaders to search for higher individual payoffs , and in parallel , we should encourage the masses to conform .",
    "if we reverse these roles , leaders loose their ability to lead , which ultimately weakens network reciprocity .",
    "we have studied the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas where a fraction of the population aspires to conform rather than to maximize payoff .",
    "thus , instead of choosing the strategy that is performing best in terms of payoff , conformists simply choose the strategy that is most prevalent in their interaction range .",
    "we have confirmed that , in general , conformity promotes cooperation by enhancing network reciprocity @xcite .",
    "more precisely , because the dynamics between conformity - driven players is conceptually similar to the so - called majority - voter model @xcite , the interfaces between competing domains become smoother , which effectively minimizes invasion possibilities for the defectors .",
    "what we have focused on specifically in the present paper is the fact that individuals within a population will typically be different in terms of the influence they are able to exert on others .",
    "the question then becomes who should conform if the goal is a socially desirable evolutionary outcome with ample cooperation .",
    "should it be leaders , i.e. , players with the highest degree , collective influence , or teaching activity , or should it be the masses , i.e. , players with the lowest of these properties ? is it beneficial for the society if leaders tend to follow the masses ? using the simplest alternative , which is to assign conformists randomly regardless of their rank , as the benchmark , we have shown that leaders should not be conformists in evolutionary social dilemmas .",
    "socially most favorable outcomes emerge only if the masses conform .",
    "this result is both intuitive as well as easily understandable in terms of the macroscopic dynamics that conditions it . in particular , we have argued that forcing the leaders to conform significantly hinders the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and coordination .",
    "leaders must be able to create a following , which ultimately results in homogenous groups or clusters competing in the population .",
    "this competition is then swayed in favor of cooperators by the virtue of network reciprocity , which is further enhanced by smooth(er ) interfaces that emerge due to the coordination of conformists .",
    "if , on the contrary , the leaders are made to follow , an unnatural coordination emerges  the masses are expected to drive cooperation , but their limited interaction range and related weakness preclude this  which ultimately hinders the successful evolution of cooperation .",
    "our results suggest that conformity might have had an evolutionary origin in that it promotes prosocial behavior .",
    "although payoff maximization is surely an apt description of interactions among simpler forms of life , the preference to conform might also be a good heuristic in social decision making as it can help to avoid punishment or earn a reward @xcite , or it could also be the result of an effort to internalize the most common strategies among their neighbors . in the latter case , it could also be a source of an emerging social norm @xcite .",
    "regardless of what the goal of an interaction is , the present study is a simple example of `` multi - target '' evolutionary games , where the diversity of individual targets one may hope to achieve is mirrored in the array of strategies one can adopt for each specific purpose .",
    "this theoretical framework offers many possibilities to explore in the future , such as changing goals over time , considering not only expected payoffs but also the associated distribution of payoffs @xcite , or looking at the coevolution of behavior and cognition @xcite .",
    "we conclude with the hope that this paper will help motivate research along these lines in the near future .",
    "as the interaction network , we use either homogeneous networks with a uniform degree distribution , such as the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions or random regular graphs with the same average degree @xmath40 , or heterogeneous graphs including erds - rnyi random networks with average degree @xmath41 , or barabsi - albert scale - free networks with an average degree @xmath40 . for the generation of the latter ,",
    "we implement the standard growth and preferential attachment algorithm , as described in @xcite .    in terms of the simulation procedure ,",
    "we note that each full monte carlo step ( mcs ) consists of @xmath42 elementary steps described above when introducing evolutionary games with conformists , which are repeated consecutively , thus giving a chance to every player to change its strategy once on average .",
    "all simulation results are obtained on networks typically comprising @xmath43 players .",
    "we determine the fraction of cooperators @xmath37 in the stationary state after a sufficiently long relaxation time lasting up to @xmath44 mcs . to further improve accuracy ,",
    "the final results are averaged over up to @xmath45 independent realizations , including the generation of scale - free and erds - rnyi networks , as well as random initial strategy distributions , for each set of parameter values .",
    "we also note that the results are independent of whether the assignment of conformity to the fraction @xmath18 of the population is done only once at the start of the simulation or if conformity is assigned to players at each instance of the game anew ."
