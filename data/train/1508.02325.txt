    "quantum nonlocality and entanglement identify two kinds of quantum correlations that are at the foundations of quantum mechanics and play an essential role in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "although for pure states of a bipartite system the two concepts coincide , for mixed states the presence of entanglement does not imply in general nonlocality , the latter being a stronger quantumness property than entanglement @xcite .",
    "in many scenarios a quantum system exists in mixed states , particularly during its dynamics due to the interaction with the surrounding environment which induces decoherence and therefore mixedness @xcite . moreover , the environmental effects are usually detrimental for entanglement and nonlocality in a configuration of separated noninteracting qubits embedded in independent local environments @xcite .",
    "such a situation is typical for quantum communication and information protocols where the supports of the single - particle wave functions are centered around sufficiently far locations or the particles are separated by an energy barrier large enough , as in experiments with photons in different optical modes or with strongly repelling trapped ions @xcite .",
    "it is thus useful to find dynamical equations that relate these two kinds of quantum correlations , for instance in order to acquire information on the presence of nonlocality just by looking at the quantum entanglement of the overall system .",
    "the possible existence of closed relations between quantifiers of entanglement and nonlocality is a subject of special interest in dynamical contexts @xcite .",
    "entanglement can be quantified for an arbitrary two - qubit state by the concurrence @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "nonlocality is instead unambiguously identified if a bell inequality is violated .",
    "the bell function @xmath1 , as defined by the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) form of the bell inequality @xcite , can be then used to seek whether the system exhibits nonlocal correlations which occur with certainty if @xmath2 .",
    "an important goal within this context is to prove the existence of threshold values of concurrence which ensure nonlocal quantum correlations during a given evolutions whenever @xmath0 stays above that threshold .",
    "in fact , apart its basic interest , this behavior would permit to utilize the system state for quantum information processes relying on nonlocality , as device - independent and security - proof quantum key distribution protocols @xcite .",
    "it has been recently reported that bell function and concurrence satisfy a closed dynamical relation in the case of general pure - dephasing evolution for each qubit , provided that the qubits are initially prepared in the class of extended werner - like states @xcite .",
    "this result has been then utilized to verify the preservation of nonlocality by dynamical decoupling pulse sequences in the presence of low - frequency noise typical of the solid state @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to review the pure - dephasing relation between concurrence and bell function , giving a formal demonstration of it .",
    "successively , we apply the result to a paradigmatic system made of two independent qubits locally interacting with pure - dephasing noise sources having ohmic class spectrum . by exploiting the trapping of the single - qubit coherence which occurs in such a system @xcite",
    ", we investigate the possibility to achieve a stationary entanglement which ensures the presence of nonlocal correlations .",
    "in particular , we find the lower bound of the purity of the initial two - qubit state such as to guarantee that the stationary concurrence is above the nonlocality threshold .",
    "in order to witness nonlocality we use here the chsh form of bell inequality , which is the most suitable for an experimental test of nonlocality in bipartite quantum systems composed by two - level ( spin - like ) systems , or qubits @xcite . let the operator @xmath3 be a spin observable with eigenvalues @xmath4 associated to the spin particle @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the unit vector indicating an arbitrary direction in the spin space and @xmath8 is the pauli matrices vector .",
