    "frustrated magnetic systems with active orbital degrees of freedom have drawn a lot of attention recently among the condensed matter community because of their potential in applications such as spintronics@xcite .",
    "two classes of systems that are extensively studied in this context are magnetic spinels having transition metal ion in a pyrochlore lattice @xcite and layered materials with transition metal ion forming a two dimensional triangular / hexagonal lattice@xcite .",
    "recent experiments@xcite and theoretical calculations@xcite have shown that orbital ordering in these systems play a major role in lifting the geometrical frustration ( often via a structural transition ) and driving a ( often unconventional ) magnetic order as temperature is lowered . at high temperatures , when the lattice is completely frustrated there is a possibility of having competing electronic states . if such states are accessible by tuning an external parameter such as pressure , temperature or magnetic field , one can consider using the system as a switch or memory device in spintronics / electronics applications .",
    "the high temperature phase of natio@xmath0 seems to be a promising candidate in this context as we infer from our detail electronic structure calculations ( discussed below ) .",
    "we observe the presence of two distinct electronic states in this system ; one is insulating with a@xmath2 orbital fully occupied and the other is metallic with partially occupied doubly degenerate e@xmath1 orbitals and these two states are found to be very close by in energy .     showing layered triangular lattice formed by ti ions.,width=264 ]",
    "natio@xmath0 in its high temperature phase has rhombohedral symmetry ( space group r@xmath3 m ) .",
    "the two dimensional layer of ti ions has six equidistant nearest neighbours having ti - ti bond length 3.045  .",
    "each ti ion is surrounded by six equidistant o - ions forming tio@xmath4 octahedron with ti - o bond lengths being 2.078  .",
    "furthermore , these tio@xmath4 octahedra have a trigonal distortion as o - ti - o angles deviate from 90 degrees .",
    "the three dimensional structure of natio@xmath0 is formed by the stacking of layers of na - tio@xmath4-na .",
    "these two dimensional layers of ti ions form a triangular lattice in the x - y plane and the z - axis ( trigonal axis ) passes through the centroid of o - triangles above and below the ti layer .",
    "the x and y - axes point towards the next nearest neighbour ti ions and nearest neighbor ti ions respectively .",
    "the interlayer ti - ti distance is about 6    and is much larger compared to the intralayer ti - ti distance .",
    "hence the system can effectively be considered a two dimensional layered system .",
    "we have taken the experimental structure of natio@xmath0 in its high temperature phase from clarke et al .",
    "we have performed a detail electronic structure calculation for the rhombohedral phase of natio@xmath0 using standard full potential linearized augmented plane wave method which is implemented in wien2k code@xcite . for the experimental structure , the muffin tin sphere radii were chosen to be 2.23 , 2.07 and 1.83 a.u . for na , ti and o respectively .",
    "plane wave cutoff parameter r@xmath5k@xmath6 was choosen as 7.00 and approximately 120 k - points were used over the irreducible first brillouin zone .",
    "convergence has been achieved to energy values less than 1 mev per formula unit with respect to the variation of number of k - points and the parameter rk@xmath6 .    as natio@xmath0 contains a transition metal ion having one d electron in the outermost shell",
    ", coulomb correlations are expected to be significant in this system .",
    "therefore , we have performed calculations within local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and the lsda+u approximation ( which includes orbital coulomb correlation ) .",
    "more than one implementation is available for the latter method generating different double counting corrections for the underlying lsda functional . for moderately correlated ( or metallic ) systems a mean field approximation to the d - orbital part of the lsda functional",
    "is considered to be appropriate .",
    "this is described in details as the around mean field ( amf ) functional in ref.@xcite .",
    "as natio@xmath0 is observed to be a bad metal in both high and low temperature phase experimentally@xcite , we have chosen the amf method in our lsda+u calculations reported below . in this work",
    "we consider a range of u values ( 3.3 - 4 ev ) with emphasis on two in particular : 3.6ev and 4.0ev .",
    "the former is obtained theoretically via constrained lda calculations by the authors of ref.@xcite , specifically for this compound .",
    "this value is very close to that used ( u=3.3ev ) for compounds like tiocl , natisi2o6 , ( la , y)tio3 which gives good agreement with experimental data like magnetic susceptibility@xcite , spin gap @xcite , optical measurements @xcite , respectively . therefore we take it as a physically reasonable value .",
    "the latter is considered merely for theoretical purposes .",
    "we first study the electronic ground state of the experimental crystal structure within the lsda and lsda+u functionals . fig .",
    "[ bslsdaexp ] shows the electronic band structure within lsda .",
    "the ground state is found to be metallic with ti d states present at the fermi level in both spin directions .",
    "one also observes that after the octahedral crystal field splitting only t@xmath7 states lie at the fermi level .",
    "these are then further split due to the trigonal crystal field of oxygens into two sub - manifolds : e@xmath1 and a@xmath2 , the former being doubly degenerate .    in the system @xmath8 of fig .",

[ density-0.23 ] ) ; as a result the a@xmath2 -a@xmath2 direct overlap of @xmath11 type is very small .",

    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 components have maximum amplitude within the @xmath14 plane ( @xmath16 ) and generate an almost circularly symmetric density providing distributed overlap over all six coordinating ti atoms .",
    "their direct overlap is of @xmath11 type ( therefore much stronger than the a@xmath2 -a@xmath2 overlap ) and produces an efficiently delocalising wave function .",

    "the @xmath17 component has all 4 lobes @xmath12-bonding along the @xmath18 axis where the ti - ti distance is shortest .",
    "the @xmath19 component has only two lobes remaining from its linear combination with @xmath15 within the @xmath19 plane : the two pointing towards the oxygen ( direction @xmath20 ) vanish and the two pointing in between the other two oxygens are conserved .    from band structure analysis",
    "we see that the bands cutting the fermi level have predominantly e@xmath1 character .",
    "in particular the @xmath17 component is present in the lowest band and the @xmath14 and @xmath15 components in the next one .",
    "the highest band of the @xmath21 group has mainly a@xmath2 character .    in table",
    "[ occnr ] we present electron population analysis within lsda i.e. the occupation numbers of the @xmath21 bands up to the fermi level ( excluding the valence band contributions due to bonding ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we note that the occupied bands ( labelled e@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ bslsdaexp ] ) have a non neligible character of type a@xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the significant trigonal distortion of the oxygen octahedron which causes the mixing of the two @xmath21 subgroups .",
    "the lsda functional however predicts a slight predominance of e@xmath1 over a@xmath2 occupation ( for comparison the former should be divided by two due to its degeneracy ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that e@xmath1 states allow the hopping of electrons over a dense 2d triangular network of ti atoms ( high coordination number and effective orbital overlap in contrast to analogous compound like f.i .",
    "tiocl  @xcite ) thus generating a significant energy gain due to electron delocalisation .",
    "since they are doubly degenerate and not fully occupied ( 1 electron per ti atom ) the electronic structure is metallic .    .lsda",

    "[ bslsdauexp ] shows the band structure in both majority and minority spin channels for a physically reasonable value of u = 3.6 ev for titanium@xcite .",
    "the effect here consists merely in a complete spin polarisation of the bands . due to the degeneracy of the e@xmath1 states at the fermi level",
    ", no further orbital polarization could be induced by the orbital coulomb correlation @xmath22 within lsda+u approximation .",
    "therefore , the two majority spin bands remain half filled and the system behaves as a metal .        from table",
    "[ occnr ] we note that the occupation number of the a@xmath2 orbital is smaller but rather close to the e@xmath1 one ( divided by two due to its degeneracy ) .",
    "this suggests that the electronic excitation with a@xmath2 orbital occupied is a low energy one . in order to estimate the magnitude of this excitation energy",
    ", we took the approach of orbital locking .",
    "in this approach , the occupation of a chosen orbital is kept fixed till convergence and then relaxed within a second convergency run .",
    "the orbital occupation is fixed by manually setting the initial density matrices ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "we call the electronic configuration with a@xmath2 orbital occupied predominantly as es1 state and that with e@xmath1 orbital occupied predominantly as es2 state , hereafter . note that for u=3.6ev es2 is the ground state .",
    "by forcing the single ti d - electron to occupy the a@xmath2 orbital and then allowing it to relax ( es1 ) we obtain a stable solution with a total energy about 5mev ( per formula unit ) higher than the ground state one ( fig .",
    "[ bslsdauagexp ] ) , using u=3.6ev .",
    "this state represents a collective excited state and its electronic structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bslsdauagexp ] ( a ) .",
    "it shows the feature of an almost zero gap semiconductor therefore having extremely limited conductivity .",
    "increasing u to a theoretical value of 4 ev , the es1 state becomes the ground state whereas es2 is now an excited state by a tiny energy difference ( see next discussion on dependence on u ) .",
    "[ bslsdauagexp ] ( b ) shows the es1 state with a single a@xmath2 band below the fermi level and the opening of a gap in the majority spin channel due to a stronger u. in comparison to previous u value , here the conductivity is totally absent .",
    "based on this result and given the proximity in energies of the es1 and es2 states we study their stability as dft solutions with varying u. this is obtained using the approach of orbital locking as mentioned earlier . the plot of the resulting total energy difference of the two solutions is presented in fig .",
    "[ devsu ] .",
    "we see that for u values in the region considered physically reasonable for titanium ( around 3.6ev ) the es2 state is the ground state but lower in energy from the es1 state by only about or less than 5 mev ( this is well above the error bar mentioned in the methodology section ) .",
    "as u crosses the value 3.7 ev , es1 becomes the ground state with the gradual opening of a gap . for u=4ev",
    "the gap magnitude in the majority spin channel amounts to about 0.4 ev ( see fig .",
    "[ bslsdauagexp](b ) ) .",
    "the above results show the interplay between two standard and competing mechanisms ( energy scales ) in transition metal compounds : the localisation ( u ) favoring a@xmath2 occupation and the delocalisation ( kinetic energy ) favouring e@xmath1 .",
    "this holds for a wide range of temperatures up to room temperature but for very low temperature ( @xmath23 5mev @xmath24 50",
    "k ) the excited state can not be thermally reached and only the e@xmath1 state is populated .    for the physical value of u=3.6ev our results",
    "are inline with experimental results by clarke  @xcite whereby a bad metal with low but non zero conductivity is found .",
    "the bad metallic behaviour is ascribed to the existence of an almost insulating state ( es1,a@xmath2 ) very close in energy ( 5mev ) to a conducting ground state ( es2,e@xmath1 ) .",
    "previous calculations on the high temperature phase of this system was reported in reference  @xcite where the authors found an insulating behaviour within the lsda+u ( u=3.6ev ) approximation with a spin - polarised a@xmath2 band being fully occupied and a gap of about 1 ev . though we observe the insulating es1 state as ground state for higher u values",
    "( u @xmath25 3.7ev ) , for u=3.6ev we clearly see that es2 state is the ground state . more importantly , we observe that these two electronic states ( es1 and es2 ) have very closeby energies over a reasonably large range of u values ( see fig .",
    "+ we would also like to mention that in the calculation reported in reference  @xcite , already within lsda the a@xmath2 occupation was obtained to be higher than that of e@xmath1 which is opposite to what we observe here ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy is due to the adoption of the linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) basis set in the previous calculations contrary to linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) basis used here .",
    "lmto is known to be deficient in describing the interstitial region in between atomic ( muffin tin ) spheres with respect to the lapw method ( see sec .",
    "iii of ref .",
    "@xcite as an example ) .",
    "the appropriate description of this region is fundamental to take into account electron delocalization effects via a realistic overlap of the orbitals of e@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "finally , ref .",
    "@xcite finds the compound to be insulating in contrast to experimental results  @xcite .",
    "hence the results presented in this work better describes the experimental situation .      following an ab - initio approach we investigate the equilibrium structure within the high temperature phase symmetry which allows only for oxygen displacements along the z - axis ( fig .",
    "[ crysstr ] ) . given the low dimensionality of the problem , we choose to optimize the oxygen positions using the total energy minimization method which is based on drawing the energy curve as a function of the oxygen coordinate ( z , z , z )  @xcite .",
    "lattice parameters are kept at their experimental values .",
    "this has the advantage of simulating the effect of van der waal s forces between layers given that they are not taken into account within dft .",
    "as learnt in previous section , the system presents two almost degenerate groundstates for relevant u values : es2 ( ground state ) and es1 ( low lying excited state ) .",
    "therefore we study the stability of both states as a function of the oxygen coordinate applying the orbital locking method as in previous section .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ crossover ] we present the results for two values of u. the full curve represents the total energy of es1 state and the dashed one is that of es2 state . for the theoretical u ( = 4ev ) ( fig .",
    "7b ) the es1 state is much lower in energy",
    "than the es2 one and represents the groundstate for all oxygen positions .",
    "( note that the es2 state is not stable for all oxygen positions , as indicated by the dashed curve having no value below the experimental z ( = 0.2348 ) .",
    "this is probably due to the crystal field of oxygen atoms preventing the electron delocalisation within es2 state . )",
    "however , for the physical u ( 3.6ev ) ( fig .",
    "7a ) the energies of es1 and es2 become comparable for several oxygen positions .",
    "as a consequence there exists a range of oxygen positions ( 0.233,0.235 ) for which the total energy is almost constant . as a result oxygen thermal vibrations",
    "would be characterised by large amplitudes and generate pronounced orbital fluctuations between a@xmath2 and e@xmath1 states .         the overall energy landscape for three values of u is shown in fig .",
    "[ optoxyg ] . within the lsda functional ( u=0 ) ,",
    "the experimental structure is found to be the equilibrium one . on the contrary for the physical u ( 3.6ev ) , the energy landscape is clearly flat as it is for u=4ev but to a lesser degree . in the inset , a zoom - in of the energy curve for u=3.6ev is given showing quantitatively the flatness of the energy curve : its variation remains below 20 mev in a wide range of z values ( 0.231 , 0.236 ) . at room temperature",
    "this landscape gives rise to soft oxygen vibrational modes with quite large oscillation amplitudes which enhance orbital fluctuations significantly .",
    "= 0.2348 corresponds to the experimental structure .",
    "smaller values of z represent shorter ti - o bond length .",
    "inset shows a closer view of the energy landscape near the equilibrium point for u=3.6 ev ; empty symbols represent es2 state and full ones es1 state.,width=377 ]    it is worth mentioning that the optimization of lattice parameters does not alter the conclusions drawn above qualitatively .",
    "for example , optimization within lda leads to reduction in both @xmath26 and @xmath27 parameters by about 2@xmath28 .",
    "the reduction of @xmath26 causes a greater overlap of e@xmath1 orbitals thus making es2 more stable .",
    "competing to this is the shrinking of @xmath27 which favours es1 ( a@xmath2 ) due to the crystal field of oxygen being closer to e@xmath1 orbitals .",
    "we note that the above scenario suggest a possible explanation for the anomalous value of the specific heat jump at the structural transition : this is in fact found to be bigger than the one for pure spin system by takeda _",
    "al _  @xcite .",
    "al _ @xcite have extracted from takeda s measurements a value of the entropy change of 7 j k@xmath29 mol@xmath29 . in case of long range antiferromagnetic ordering of s=1/2",
    "spins the entropy change should be r ln(2s + 1 ) = r ln 2 = 5.8 j k@xmath29 mol@xmath29@xcite .",
    "no magnetic long range order is found in this system and short range antiferromagnetic correlations could only give rise to an entropy change lower than r ln(2s + 1 ) .",
    "this would be even further away from the experimental value of 7 j k@xmath29 mol@xmath29 . in this work we have shown at length the relevance and interplay of orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "as there are both experimental and theoretical predictions@xcite for long range orbital order ( with partial orbital polarization at each site ) at low temperatures , the entropy change is expected to be lower but indicatively close to r @xmath30 where the quantum number",
    "@xmath31 represents the three orbitals : a@xmath2 and e@xmath1 .",
    "this upper bound amounts to 9.1 j k@xmath29 mol@xmath29 which would make the entropy change due to orbital order with partial orbital polarization close to the experimental 7 j k@xmath29 mol@xmath29 .",
    "we have performed a detail electronic structure calculation for the high temperature rhombohedral phase of natio@xmath0 .",
    "we first study the electronic properties of the ( non optimised ) experimental structure .",
    "the ground state is found to be conducting with e@xmath1 orbital symmetry . at an energy",
    "slightly greater than the ground state we find an excited state with a@xmath2 orbital symmetry and almost fully insulating . by thermal excitation",
    "the latter is populated comparably to the ground state giving rise to an overall low conductivity .",
    "this is inline with what found by clarke et al .",
    "@xcite in their experiments .",
    "secondly , we study the variation of the above properties with respect to lattice via static distortions of oxygen positions along the trigonal axis . depending on the oxygen proximity to the ti plane the a@xmath2 ( oxygens close to the ti plane ) or e@xmath1 ( oxygens distant from the ti plane ) orbitals will be alternately populated .",
    "moreover we find the energy landscape to be rather flat which gives rise to a large vibrational amplitude .",
    "this implies that at room temperature the population of a@xmath2 or e@xmath1 orbitals will oscillate significantly .",
    "the specific heat jump at 250 k detected by takeda et al.@xcite could , therefore , be tentatively accounted for by an entropy contribution coming from orbital degree of freedom rather than spin .",

    "the initial density matrices ( @xmath32 ) supplied for the es1 and es2 electronic state within orbital lock approach are in the basis ( l=-2,-1,0,1,2 ) as described below . for es1 state the diagonal elements of the spin up density matrix are set to ( 0.0 , 0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0 ) and the remaining matrix elements to zero .",
