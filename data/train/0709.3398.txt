    "in this paper we will reproduce in detail the derivation of connection between the differential cross - section in particle @xmath0 momentum and @xmath18-matrix element @xcite . as in the framework of the same scheme the similar calculation for the cross - section on nearest approach parameter @xmath4 @xcite will be made .",
    "let us examine the process @xmath19  for two physical cases .",
    "in the first case particle @xmath0 is created with fixed momentum @xmath20  , the second , particle @xmath0 is created in state @xmath21 . the differential cross - section on transverse momentum of the particle @xmath0 is @xmath22 here @xmath23 is relative speed of initial particles , @xmath24 are densities of particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath25 means that the particle @xmath0 scatters to the forward and backward half - sphere ( @xmath26-axis is directed along the momentum of particle @xmath11 ) , and @xmath27 is the total number of particles @xmath0 and @xmath28 creation events in all space ( volume @xmath29 ) during infinite time ( @xmath30 ) . this is @xmath31 where @xmath32 the creation operators are related to particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , operator @xmath33 is connected with @xmath18-matrix by relation @xmath34 .",
    "translational invariance allows present the matrix element in the form : @xmath35 therefore : @xmath36 here , the four - momentum @xmath37 . in ( [ diff3 ] )",
    "the @xmath38 - function determines the energy shell for particle @xmath0 reaction : @xmath39 let us define : @xmath40 then the following relation is valid : @xmath41 integrating ( [ diff3 ] ) over @xmath6 we get : @xmath42 so , we obtain a relation for particle @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution : @xmath43 let us define : @xmath44 then ( [ diff8 ] ) takes a view : @xmath45 the differential cross - section is resulted by substitution ( [ diff8a ] ) to relation ( [ diff1 ] ) .    here",
    "we mark an important notice .",
    "an angle dependents in cross section @xmath46 appears not only through variable @xmath7 , but in general case also through @xmath47 . in the frame of particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 centre of mass ( c.m.f . )",
    "the particle @xmath0 energy defined only through square of invariant mass @xmath48 . and",
    "it is @xmath49 so : @xmath50 and @xmath51 is nt depend for scattering angle ( the star means c.m.f . ) .",
    "the situation changes in the labor frame ( l.f . ) . in this case",
    "there are critical parameter @xmath52 which is @xcite @xmath53  . in the case",
    "@xmath54 the connection between particle @xmath0 momentum and scattering angle has a single meaning and has a view : @xmath55^{1/2}}{(e_{a}+m_{b})^2 -p_{a}^2 \\cos^2 ( \\theta ) } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is scattering angle in l.f .",
    "( there is nt the maximum angle limitation ) .",
    "we will back to discuss this expression below .",
    "now we discuss the case , when the particle @xmath0 creates in state @xmath57 . choosing for state @xmath58 the corresponding basis , we obtain following relation for the total number of @xmath0 and @xmath28 particles creation events @xcite : @xmath59    as distinct from the previous case , the state @xmath60 is not a state with a define momentum .",
    "so the particle @xmath0 cross - section in this state ca nt be expressed through the matrix element @xmath61 . to find @xmath62",
    "we will use a state expansion on states with the fixed particle @xmath0 transverse momentum @xcite : @xmath63 substituting this expansion to ( [ diff9 ] ) we obtain : @xmath64 where we use a notation : @xmath65 let us make an identical transformation in ( [ diff11 ] ) : @xmath66+f(\\vec{k}_{\\bot},\\vec{q}_{1})~,\\ ] ] @xmath67+\\bar{f}(\\vec{q}_{\\bot},\\vec{q}_{1})~.\\ ] ] then : @xmath68 the second term in ( [ diff11b ] ) is turned to zero , owing to the completeness of the system of basic functions @xmath69 @xcite : @xmath70 finally we obtain : @xmath71    such representation for @xmath27 is universal in the meaning that it follows both differential cross - sections in terms of @xmath7 and also in terms of @xmath72 .",
    "this allows mark out singular factors in @xmath27 , connected with infinite time and volume .",
    "turning to the matrix elements from @xmath33 to @xmath73 and integrating over momentum @xmath74 , we get : @xmath75 if we integrate this correlation over the parameter @xmath72 and momentum @xmath6 then we automatically obtain relation ( [ diff8a ] ) .",
    "but we will integrate over momentum @xmath76 .",
    "so we have : @xmath77 where @xcite @xmath78    further integrating over @xmath6 in relation ( [ diff16 ] ) we obtain : @xmath79 taking into account ( [ diff8a ] ) we can rewrite this expression in the following form : @xmath80 this relation for the total number of events @xmath27 is right in any frame of particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 . crossing from @xmath27 to differential distribution demands fixation of frame .",
    "if the initial state set in c.m.f , then @xmath81 do nt depend of the scattering angle . and",
    "in this case we have for the differential distribution on @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 there are @xmath85 everywhere below ( reaction surface ) .    using relations between @xmath86 and @xmath4 @xmath87 we get a distribution on @xmath1 .",
    "so we have for differential cross - sections : @xmath88 the matrix element @xmath73 is connected with @xmath89-matrix by relation @xmath90  .",
    "now , let us integrate @xmath62 ( [ diff21 ] ) over the direction of vector @xmath72 : @xmath91 here we used an integral representation of cone function @xcite : @xmath92 subsequent transformation of differential cross - section on @xmath72 connect with turning to hyperbolic variables : @xmath93    in this variables the differential volume is : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the azimuth angle of vector @xmath7 .",
    "taking into account that the differential cross - section @xmath96 does not depend on @xmath95 we obtain : @xmath97 where the angular part of the cross - section in the right part of integral is expressed through the variable @xmath98 .",
    "finally we represent the differential cross - section on @xmath86 through the differential cross - section on scattering angle .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be axial and azimuth angles of the momentum @xmath20 .",
    "let us turn to integrating over this angles in the expression ( [ diff25 ] ) .",
    "for this we notice that for arbitrary function @xmath101 the following integral relation is right : @xmath102 @xmath103 from this follows that : @xmath104 or in terms of @xmath105 and @xmath95 angles @xmath106 @xmath107 so relations between variables are @xmath108 we turn to integrating over angles in the integral ( [ diff25 ] ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the differential cross - section on the cosine of scattering angle of particle @xmath0 in the @xmath10 process .",
    "here is taken into account that @xmath96 do not depend of variable @xmath100 , therefore @xmath111 unifying relations ( [ diff17 ] ) , ( [ diff21 ] ) , ( [ diff27 ] ) and taking into account that : @xmath112 we obtain the norm of the differential cross - section on the total cross - section @xmath113 @xmath114    as follows from ( [ diff21 ] ) , in contrast to @xmath115 the differential cross - section @xmath62 is not positively sign determined on all @xmath86 interval .",
    "contribution of negative value area of @xmath116 reduces effectively to decreasing of the total event number of particle @xmath0 creation .",
    "so , this spatial area we can interpret as area where taking place an absorption of particles @xmath0 .",
    "but the total number of asymptotic states with define @xmath86 regulates by the relation ( [ norma ] ) .",
    "as an example we discuss an one - particle exchange in @xmath118-channel , for elastic @xmath119 scattering . corresponding cross section as function of @xmath98 has a polar view : @xmath120 here @xmath121 @xmath122  mass of exchange particle , @xmath123 )  wellknown the triangle function , @xmath124  the coupling constant , @xmath125    in this case for the cross - section @xmath126 we obtain : @xmath127 where @xmath128    the integral ( [ diff25a ] ) with such cross section is computed analytically .",

    "the cones function is positive with such argument ( and associated cones functions with @xmath138 too ) .",
    "so the cross - section is positive defined on @xmath139 . on @xmath140 the @xmath1-plane divides into zones with radiuses @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 fig.1b .",
