    "considerable theoretical effort is currently directed toward understanding the coalescence of binary neutron stars .",
    "the interest stems partly from the promise such coalescence holds for generating gravitational waves that can be detected by laser interferometers now under construction , like ligo , virgo and geo .",
    "additional interest is triggered by the idea that neutrinos generated during the merger and coalescence might be the source of gamma rays bursts ( see , e.g. , paczyski , 1986 ; eichler _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1989 ; janka & ruffert , 1996 ) .",
    "most of the theoretical work has , to date , been performed in a newtonian framework ( see , e.g. , rasio & shapiro , 1994 ; ruffert , janka & schfer 1996 ; zhuge , centrella & mcmillan , 1996 ) . only a few hydrodynamical calculations have taken into account post - newtonian corrections ( oohara & nakamura , 1995 ; shibata , oohara & nakamura , 1997 ) , while results from calculations in full general relativity are very preliminary ( oohara & nakamura , 1995 ; wilson & mathews , 1995 ; wilson , mathews & marronetti , 1996 ) .",
    "there are a number of issues , however , that can not be addressed even qualitatively in newtonian gravitation .",
    "such issues include the collapse of the merged remnant to a black hole .",
    "such a collapse is quite likely because the mass of the remnant will probably exceed the maximum allowed mass for a single neutron star .",
    "however , the final fate of the collapse is completely unknown if the remnant s angular momentum parameter @xmath1 exceeds unity . in this case",
    ", the remnant can not form a kerr black hole without first losing some of its angular momentum . in principle , angular momentum could be radiated away by the emission of gravitational waves , neutrinos , and/or electromagnetic ( e.g. magnetic dipole ) radiation .    during the coalescence of the two neutron stars some fraction of the kinetic energy will be converted into thermal energy .",
    "therefore the remnant is likely to be hot and emit thermal neutrinos . during the rapid plunge of the binary",
    "once it reaches the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , the angular momentum of the system will be conserved approximately , so the remnant will be rotating very rapidly . in their fully relativistic treatment of corotating , polytropic binaries in quasiequilibrium circular orbit , baumgarte _ et .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) found that , for a polytropic equation of state with polytropic index @xmath2 , the total @xmath1 of the binary system at the isco exceeds unity for all binaries in which each member has a rest mass @xmath3 .",
    "here @xmath4 is the maximum allowed rest mass of a nonrotating , isolated , cold neutron star , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the total rest mass , energy and angular momentum of the binary system . for more realistic , nonsynchronous binaries ,",
    "@xmath1 is likely to be somewhat smaller , but may still be appreciable . for many of these binaries",
    "the rest mass of the merged remnant also exceeds @xmath4 . immediately following merger",
    ", these objects may be temporarily stabilized by thermal pressure and angular momentum .",
    "only after some of the thermal energy and angular momentum have been radiated away can the star later collapse to a black hole .",
    "the ultimate fate of such an object can only be established by a three - dimensional , relativistic hydrodynamic numerical simulation which employs a hot nuclear equation or state and full neutrino radiation transport . while the development of such a code is underway by several groups , it is still very far from complete .",
    "our goal in this paper is to isolate the role of the neutrino emission in the early evolution following merger and to estimate its effect on the angular momentum @xmath7 and the angular momentum parameter @xmath1 .",
    "to do so , we consider a simplified scenario for the post - merger neutron star remnant and imagine that the remnant evolves to an axisymmetric , quasi - equilibrium state on a dynamical ( orbital ) timescale immediately following merger . since the merger follows a rapid plunge from the isco , the merged remnant forms with the same total mass @xmath6 , the rest mass @xmath5 and the angular momentum @xmath7 of the progenitor binary at the isco ( here we neglect the small loss of mass and angular momentum via gravitational waves and gas ejection during the dynamical plunge ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath1 will typically be near unity .",
    "we assume that the merged configuration quickly settles into uniformly rotating , dynamically stable quasiequilibrium state and focus on its quasi - static evolution .",
    "we show that the emission of neutrinos is very inefficient in carrying off @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the stiffness of the equation of state , this emission may lead to either an increase or a decrease of @xmath1 . also , we argue that these objects typically develop a bar instability on a timescale comparable or shorter than the neutrino emission timescale .",
    "we therefore conclude that while neutrino emission may be important for the cooling of the remnant , it is negligible for the emission of angular momentum",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we estimate the rate of angular momentum loss by neutrino emission . in section",
    "3 we incorporate our estimate in a post - newtonian , ellipsoidal model calculation , that follows the post - merger evolution of the remnant .",
    "the equations and formalism for this approximation are presented in appendix  a. in section  4 we compare the relevant timescales for angular momentum loss by competing processes , and we summarize our conclusions in section  5 .",
    "consider a neutrino @xmath8 with four - momentum @xmath9 emitted from the surface of a uniformly rotating axisymmetric equilibrium star into an arbitrary direction .",
    "a local observer with four velocity @xmath10 comoving with the surface will measure the neutrino s energy to be @xmath11 here and throughout the paper we adopt geometrized units , @xmath12 .",
    "since the spacetime is stationary and axisymmetric , the components @xmath13 and @xmath14 are conserved along the neutrino s path . therefore , a distant observer at rest with respect to the star s center of mass will measure the neutrino s energy to be @xmath15 a distant observer will identify the neutrino s angular momentum to be @xmath16 combining the last three equations yields the familiar result ( e.g. , thorne , 1971 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angular velocity of the rotation .",
    "the luminosity as measured by a local , comoving observer can be defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the observer s proper time .",
    "equation  ( [ fl0 ] ) can then be rewritten @xmath21 where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "equation  ( [ fl ] ) is fully relativistic .",
    "the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 depends on the characteristics of the emission of the neutrinos from the star s surface , as well as the relativistic structure of the star . establishing this relationship",
    "therefore requires detailed numerical models of radiating , relativistic , rotating stars .",
    "instead , we adopt a simple , first - order newtonian description to find the approximate relationship given by equation  ( [ dotj2 ] ) below .",
    "we assume that the neutrinos are emitted isotropically in the rest frame of a local stationary observer comoving with the surface .",
    "an observer in a nonrotating static frame will therefore find that , on average , each neutrino carries off some angular momentum .",
    "this angular momentum can be found by lorentz transforming from the stationary frame into the static frame .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath24 we find that , on average , each neutrino carries off a linear momentum @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the angular velocity of the star , @xmath27 the distance of the surface element from the axis of rotation , and @xmath28 is the energy of the neutrino in the comoving frame ( equation  ( 1 ) ) . the corresponding angular momentum is @xmath29 the total rate of loss of angular momentum is therefore ( see also kazanas , 1977 ) @xmath30 where @xmath22 is the neutrino luminosity and @xmath31 denotes the average of @xmath32 over the surface of the star .",
    "we can get a reasonable estimate for this average by adopting a rotating , compressible ellipsoid model for the star ( see lai , rasio & shapiro , 1993 , hereafter lrs ) . if we denote the principal axes by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is measured in the equatorial plane and @xmath35 is along the rotation axis ) , we find @xmath37 where f(e ) & & ^a_1_0 ^3 ( ) ^1/2 d & = & 1 - e^2 + o(e^4 ) . here",
    "@xmath38 is the eccentricity , and @xmath39 is the surface area of the ellipsoid .",
    "note that @xmath40 even for large eccentricities .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite equation  ( [ dotj1 ] ) in terms of the angular momentum @xmath7 and the moment of inertia @xmath41 .",
    "the latter is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a dimensionless structure constant of order unity which depends on the star s density profile . for a polytropic equation of state @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pressure , @xmath46 the rest mass density , @xmath47",
    "the polytropic index and @xmath48 the polytropic constant , @xmath43 can be derived from the lane - emden function ( see , e.g , lrs ) . equation  ( [ dotj1 ] )",
    "can then be written @xmath49    from equation  ( [ dotj2 ] ) , we find that the angular momentum @xmath7 changes by at most ( huet , 1996 ) @xmath50 assuming that the merged remnant radiates away all of its thermal energy @xmath51 prior to collapse . the ratio @xmath52 following merger can be estimated by taking the progenitor stars to be cold , with @xmath53 , prior to reaching the isco . during the subsequent plunge and merger ,",
    "a part of the kinetic energy will be converted into thermal energy by contact shocks ( rasio & shapiro , 1994 ; ruffert , janka & schfer , 1996 ) . in the extreme case of a head - on collision ,",
    "a very large part of the kinetic energy will be converted into heat .",
    "the isco , however , usually occurs at a very small separation of the stars , and therefore we expect that only a small part of the kinetic energy will be converted into heat .    to estimate @xmath54 , we construct post - newtonian , compressible ellipsoid models of hot , uniformly rotating stars , generalizing the cold post - newtonian models of lombardi , rasio and shapiro ( 1997 ) . matching these configurations to binary models at the isco calculated by baumgarte _ et .",
    "( 1997b ) , we typically find @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the total internal energy , excluding the thermal energy ( i.  e.  kinetic energy of degenerate nucleons ; see section  3 and appendix a ) .",
    "since for typical neutron stars @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 few percent following merger .",
    "hence , from equation  ( [ deltaj ] ) , we expect that the relative change of the angular momentum due to neutrino emission can be at most a few percent .",
    "we conclude that neutrinos are very inefficient in reducing the merged remnant s angular momentum .",
    "we now focus on the change in @xmath1 associated with the neutrino luminosity @xmath22 : [ cri0 ] & = & - 2 & = & ( 1 - 4 - ) . here",
    "we have used equations  ( [ fl ] ) and  ( [ dotj2 ] ) as well as @xmath59 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 therefore _ increases _ if @xmath60 for a dynamically stable rotating ellipsoid with rotational velocity @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see below ) , we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath40 , so that this criterion reduces to @xmath65 the critical value of @xmath66 corresponds to a polytropic index of @xmath67 ( see , e.g. , lrs , table 1 ) .",
    "neutrino radiation thus leads to an _ increase _ of the angular momentum parameter @xmath1 for all equations of state with @xmath68 .",
    "interestingly , the value of @xmath67 is very close to typical values that are expected in realistic neutron star equations of state .",
    "note that we have derived this numerical value in the limit of slow rotation . for rapid rotation , as in the numerical example of section 3 , we find that the value for @xmath69 increases in the ellipsoidal approximation .    for values of @xmath47 close to @xmath69 , the terms on the left hand side of equation  ( [ cri1 ]",
    ") will always be close to zero .",
    "according to equation  ( [ cri0 ] ) , the fractional change of @xmath1 will therefore be much smaller than the fractional change of @xmath7 , which we have estimated to be in the order of a few percent at most .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the emission of neutrinos can lead to an increase in @xmath1 , and that for nearly newtonian configurations the sign of the change is determined essentially by the stiffness of the equation of state .",
    "= 2.5 in    to illustrate these effects , we dynamically evolve axisymmetric post - newtonian , compressible ellipsoid models of hot neutron star merger remnants . we employ the formalism of lai , rasio & shapiro ( 1994 ) , supplemented by post - newtonian corrections ( lombardi , rasio & shapiro , 1997 ) and thermal contributions to the internal energy .",
    "the thermal corrections are taken into account by naively decomposing the polytropic constant @xmath48 in  ( [ eos ] ) into a linear sum of a cold and a hot contribution , @xmath70 . the complete formalism and equations",
    "can be found in appendix  a.    = 2.5 in    for initial data we construct equilibrium configurations as described in appendix  a.3 .",
    "these models of hot , rotating neutron stars form a three parameter family , which can be uniquely determined by the central density , the eccentricity and the thermal heat content @xmath71 .",
    "we can choose these three parameters such that the stars rest mass @xmath5 , total energy @xmath6 and angular momentum @xmath7 match those of binary configurations at the isco as calculated by baumgarte _ et .",
    "al _ ( 1997a , b ) . here , we summarize results for two different progenitor binary models with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see lines 5 and 6 of table 2 in baumgarte _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1997b , for the binary parameters ) .",
    "the two models differ by how close the stellar masses are to the maximum allowed mass of an isolated star in spherical equilibrium .",
    "we pick these two particular cases since their evolution turns out to be qualitatively different . for both models , we fix @xmath74 such that the rest mass of the remant is @xmath75 , since observed binary neutron stars all have gravitational masses close to 1.4 @xmath76 , corresponding to rest masses @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath74 is determined by the relation @xmath78 , where the nondimensional quantity @xmath79 is given in table 2 .    for model 1 ( line 5 of table 2 in baumgarte _",
    "al . _ , 1997b ) , we have @xmath80 . in our post - newtonian approximation",
    ", this yields a maximum allowed rest mass of @xmath81 ( corresponding to a maximum allowed gravitational mass of @xmath82 ) for isolated , nonrotating cold stars .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained from recent , realistic nuclear equations of state ( see , e.g. , pandharipande , 1997 ) .",
    "the initial gravitational energy of model 1 is @xmath83 and the initial angular momentum parameter is @xmath84 .",
    "the remnant has an eccentricity of @xmath85 , a thermal heat content @xmath86 and @xmath87 km .",
    "the thermal energy in this model corresponds to a maximum temperature of @xmath88 mev .    for model 2 ( line 6 ) , we have @xmath89 , corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so that this model s rest mass exceeds the maximum allowed rest mass by a larger amount than model 1 .",
    "it has an initial gravitational mass of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , corresponding to a remnant of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 km . here",
    "the maximum temperature is @xmath97 mev , which is similar to typical values found by ruffert , janka & schfer ( 1996 ) .",
    "we show the dynamical evolution of these two models in figures  1 and  2 . even though the rest mass of model  1 greatly exceeds @xmath98 , it is dynamically stabilized , within our approximations , by its high angular momentum , even after all the thermal energy has been radiated away . by contrast ,",
    "model  2 collapses after it has emitted part of its thermal energy . in model  1 ,",
    "the angular momentum decreases by @xmath99 , while @xmath1 _ increases _ by @xmath100 .",
    "this shows that post - newtonian corrections in an ellipsoid approximation , as well as rotation and deviations from sphericity , cause the the critical polytropic index @xmath69 to increase to a value greater than one . in model  2 , the changes in @xmath7 and @xmath1 show the same trends but are smaller , because the star emits only a small part of the thermal energy before it collapses . in a fully relativistic treatment",
    ", the collapse would not proceed directly to a black hole , because the kerr limit on @xmath1 would be exceeded .",
    "binaries with masses closer to the maximum nonrotating mass have @xmath101 ( see table 2 in in baumgarte _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1997b ) .",
    "their remnants could collapse directly to kerr black holes .",
    "note also that the neutrino luminosity _ increases _ as model  2 undergoes delayed collapse .",
    "this is in contrast to spherically symmetric results for delayed collapse ( baumgarte , shapiro & teukolsky , 1996 ; baumgarte _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1996 ) , in which the luminosity always _ decreases _ during collapse .",
    "this difference can be understood from a simple geometrical scaling argument . as explained in detail in appendix  a , we assume for simplicity that we can write the thermal energy in the polytropic form @xmath102 ( equation  ( [ eps_therm ] ) ) . in the high temperature limit , @xmath103 , so that @xmath104 . taking the surface area of the ellipsoid to be @xmath105 we find from  ( [ l ] ) that in the diffusion approximation the luminosity scales as @xmath106 for spherically symmetric collapse , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for all @xmath109 ( which accomodates most realistic equations of state ) ,",
    "spherically symmetric collapse therefore leads to a decrease of the luminosity : the neutrino optical thickness increases faster than the thermal energy increases .",
    "if , however , the star collapses to a pancake , as in figure  2 , @xmath33 will remain finite , and @xmath110 . in this case",
    "the increase of the thermal energy overcomes the increase of the optical thickness , and the luminosity increases . whenever the surface of a collapsing star approaches a newly formed event horizon , the luminosity",
    "will always be suppressed by the increasing redshift and black hole capture .",
    "these effects are absent in our model calculations .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that the collapse of a rapidly rotating , hot neutron star following merger may leave a very distinct signature in the neutrino signal .",
    "so far we have focussed on the emission of neutrinos and their role in the evolution of the merged remnant . to estimate",
    "if this evolution is indeed governed by neutrinos , we now compare the timescale for the neutrino emission with those associated with eletromagnetic and gravitational radiation .",
    "the timescale for the emission of the neutrinos is given by the diffusion time , @xmath111 .",
    "taking @xmath112 to be rosseland mean opacity due to scattering off nondegenerate neutrons and protons ( see , e.g. , baumgarte , shapiro & teukolsky , 1996 ) , we find _ & ~ & r^2 ~ + & ~ & 4 ( ) ^2 ( ) ( ) ^-1 .",
    "assuming that electromagnetic emission is dominated by a magnetic dipole radiation , its timescale can be estimated from ( see , e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky , 1983 ) _ em & ~ & ~ & ~ & 7 10 ^ 7 ( ) ( ) ^-2 & & ( ) ^-4 ( ) ^-2 . clearly , @xmath113 is by many orders of magnitudes larger than @xmath111 . electromagnetic radiation is therefore negligible in the early evolution of hot neutron stars , unless the magnetic fields are extreme ( @xmath114 g ) .",
    "an axisymmetric , stationary star does not emit gravitational waves .",
    "however , if the ratio of the kinetic and potential energy @xmath115 is large enough , the star will develop a bar instability and will then emit gravitational radiation . more specifically",
    ", the star is secularly unstable to the formation of a bar mode if @xmath116 , and dynamically unstable if @xmath117 ( chandrasekhar , 1969 ; shapiro & teukolsky , 1983 ; see stergioulas & friedman , 1997 , and friedman & morsink , 1997 , for a recent relativistic treatment ) . writing @xmath118 in terms of the ellipsoidal expressions  ( [ w ] ) and  ( [ t_rot ] ) , we find [ beta ] t & = & ( ) ^2 & ~ & 2 ( ) ^2 .",
    "since relativistic configurations typically have @xmath119 , this suggests that all neutron stars , rotating with @xmath120 , have @xmath121 and are at least secularly unstable to the formation of a bar mode .",
    "this is in agreement with the general relativistic , numerical models of cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1992 ) . for @xmath122 ,",
    "the timescale for the formation of a bar mode driven by gravitational radiation can be approximated by ( see , e.g. , friedman & schutz , 1975 ; lai & shapiro , 1995 ) @xmath123 note that shear viscosity can also drive a bar mode instability , but it is inefficient in hot neutron stars with @xmath124 mev as is the case here ( see bonazzola , frieben & gourgoulhon , 1996 , and references therein ) . once a bar has fully developed , the gravitational radiation dissipation timescale can be estimated from the quadrupole emission formula & & _ grav ~ ~ ~ & & ~ 4 10 ^ -3 ( ) ( ) ^-2 ( ) ^-4 . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the total gravitational radiation timescale @xmath126 is therefore dominated by the initial growth time @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath127 strongly depends on @xmath118 , this timescale is quite uncertain .",
    "however , the estimate  ( [ beta ] ) suggests that for compact stars with @xmath120 , we have @xmath128 s. we then see that the evolution of these merged stars is characterized by the formation of a bar mode ( see lai & shapiro , 1995 ) and emission of gravitational waves , which may then carry off angular momentum very efficiently",
    ". in some cases , @xmath129 , and a bar may develop on a dynamical timescale ( @xmath130 few ms ; see rasio & shapiro ( 1994 ) for a numerical demonstration ) .",
    "we conclude that neutrinos are very inefficient in carrying off angular momentum from hot , massive remnants of neutron star binary mergers , even if these are rapidly rotating and have an angular momentum parameter @xmath120 .",
    "curiously , neutrino emission may even _ increase _ @xmath1 by a small amount .",
    "we find that the timescale for the formation of a bar mode may , for such objects , be much shorter than the neutrino emission timescale . for pure gravitational radiation the third term in equations  ( [ cri0 ] ) and  ( [ cri1 ] ) vanishes , so that @xmath1 always decreases .",
    "this suggests that gravitational waves will be faster and more efficient in reducing @xmath1 than neutrinos .",
    "together , these arguments may have important consequences for gravitational wave detectors , since they suggest that the evolution of mergered binary remnants will be dominated by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "in particular , should @xmath1 be larger than unity upon merger , gravitational waves seem to be the only means by which @xmath1 can be efficiently reduced to a value smaller than unity , so that the entire merged configuration can collapse to a black hole .",
    "otherwise , hydrodynamic stresses will have to support or expel some of the matter to allow the interior regions to collapse .",
    "these arguments imply that , except for cooling and deleptonizing , neutrino emission plays a very minor role in determining the mass and spin of the final configuration ( black hole or rotating neutron star ) .",
    "however , because of the role in inducing delayed collapse in some cases , the neutrinos will have to be included in calculations of the late stages of coalescence .",
    "gravitational radiation will play a very important role in determining the final mass and spin of the black hole or neutron star .",
    "this result strengthens the conclusion that a fully general relativistic description of binary neutron star mergers is essential for full understanding .",
    "note that our arguments apply to massive , hot , rotating neutron stars in general , and not only to the remnants of binary neutron stars .",
    "for example , they equally apply to newly formed , hot neutron stars in supernovae .",
    "it has recently been suggested that these stars may be stable initially , but may later deleptonize , undergo a phase transition and collapse to a black hole ( see , e.g. , brown & bethe , 1994 ) .",
    "alternatively , such a delayed collapse might result from the loss of angular momentum from a nascent , rapidly rotating neutron star which is stabilized initially by its high spin .",
    "neutrino emission could , in principle , reduce this angular momentum and hence induce collapse .",
    "while for type ii supernovae @xmath52 is slightly larger than in the examples presented in section  3 , our arguments show that the neutrino emission is still very inefficient in carrying off angular momentum .",
    "this fact makes this scenario very unlikely ( huet , 1996 ) .",
    "similarly , our analysis suggests that neutrino emission plays a negligible role in determining the quasi - steady spin rate of accreting neutron stars at the center of thorne - zytkow objects , which have recently been suggested to be likely sources of gravitational waves for detection by geo ( schutz , 1997 ) .",

    "the total energy of an axisymmetric , rotating , hot neutron star can , in a post - newtonian , ellipsoidal approximation , be written as the sum @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the internal energy , @xmath133 the potential energy , @xmath134 the kinetic energy , and @xmath135 and @xmath136 are post - newtonian corrections to the internal and potential energy .    including the post - newtonian terms",
    "not only improves the solution for relativistic stars quantitatively , but also , more importantly , it changes the solution qualitatively . without the post - newtonian corrections , a graph of the rest mass @xmath5 as a function of the central density @xmath137 exhibits no turning point . by including the post - newtonian terms",
    ", we find turning points reasonably close to the turning points of the corresponding fully relativistic ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ) solution ( see lombardi , rasio & shapiro , 1997 ) .",
