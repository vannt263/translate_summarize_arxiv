    "locality in relativistic theories ensures that space - like separated observables commute : one simply can not communicate faster than light . in non - relativistic lattice models , in contrast , there is no a priori reason for the support of time - evolved operators to stay confined within a light cone .",
    "it is one of the classic results of mathematical physics , dating back to lieb and robinson @xcite , that even in a non - relativistic quantum spin model on a lattice , locality is preserved in an approximate sense : there is always a well - defined velocity of information propagation and hence a causal , `` sound '' or",
    " light \" cone .",
    "locality is then respected under quantum spin dynamics with finite - ranged interactions , in that the support of any local observable evolved for some time will remain local to a region of size linear in this time , up to a correction that is at least exponentially suppressed . except from exponentially decaying tails , hence , one encounters a situation very much like in the relativistic setting . the lieb - robinson theorem has hence put the observation in many quantum lattice models on a rigorous footing that there exists a well - defined finite speed of propagation , often referred to as group velocity .    over the years , lieb - robinson bounds have been extended and generalized to higher - dimensional spin systems on lattices , and the bounds have been significantly improved in several ways @xcite .",
    "also , important new applications of the lieb - robinson theorem have been found : notably , the only known proof for the clustering of correlations in gapped lattice models is based on the lieb - robinson theorem @xcite , hence rigorously confirming the `` folk theorem '' in condensed matter physics that correlation functions decay exponentially in gapped models .",
    "`` area laws '' for the scaling of entropy in ground states of one - dimensional spin systems can be proven based on this result @xcite .",
    "finally , in the context of quantum information theory , it provides a bound to the velocity one can transmit quantum information through a chain of systems giving rise to a quantum channel @xcite , a topic that has received quite some attention in the quantum information literature .    in the simplest form of the lieb - robinson theorem ,",

    "@xmath7 then forms a group of automorphisms . at time zero , obviously any observable @xmath4 being supported on @xmath8 will commute with any observable @xmath9 that is supported on a disjoint set @xmath10 .",
    "the lieb - robinson bound now gives a bound to this commutator if @xmath4 is evolved in time under this local hamiltonian .",
    "it says that there exists a constant @xmath11 and a  speed of light \" @xmath12 such that @xmath13||\\leq c ||\\hat a||\\ , ||\\hat b||\\,{\\mathrm{e}}^{-\\mu ( dist(a , b)-v|t|)},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the minimal distance between the two regions and @xmath15 denotes the operator norm . in other words , outside the causal cone @xmath16 , one encounters merely an exponential tail , and the supports of @xmath17 and @xmath18 stay almost disjoint .",
    "( [ so ] ) governs the maximum speed at which a local excitation can travel through the lattice and the maximum speed at which correlations can build up over time .    the physical setting considered here",
    "can equally be viewed as the study of the situation of quickly _ quenching _ from , say , a system that is in the ground state of some local hamiltonian to a new local hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this setting has also been linked to the entanglement generation and scaling in quenched systems @xcite .",
    "studies of non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum lattice systems of this type are entering a renaissance recently , not the least due to experimental studies becoming more and more available . with atoms in optical lattices , for example",
    ", one can suddenly alter the system parameters and thus observe the _ dynamics of a quantum phase transition _ @xcite .",
    "hence , it seems only natural to apply the machinery of lieb - robinson bounds to such settings .",

    "such models correspond to discrete versions of free fields , lattice vibrations , or the superfluid limit of the bose - hubbard model . as harmonic models , applicable merely to a class of systems",
    ", the resulting bounds can indeed be made very tight , e.g. , for local hamiltonians , we find stronger than exponential suppression , while for algebraically decaying interactions the corrections to locality are also algebraically suppressed . within the considered class of models the very tight connection between the approximate locality of operators and the locality of the hamiltonian is thus revealed .",
    "these systems serve as instructive theoretical laboratories for more elaborate interacting theories for infinite - dimensional quantum systems ( and lieb - robinson bounds have fundamental implications , e.g. , in the context of using harmonic systems as quantum channels @xcite ) , about which little is known when it comes to lieb - robinson bounds ( see , however , refs .",

    "we then present bounds on the time evolved canonical coordinates and make the causal cone explicit . for the important class of weyl operators on the lattice , we explicitly find bounds on their operator norms and discuss generalizations to arbitrary operators . as an example , we discuss the case of the discrete version of the klein - gordon field , and show how the approximate locality in the lattice model becomes the exact locality in the continuum limit .",

    "@xcite , where a central limit type argument was used to show exact relaxation in a quenched system  the intuition being that inside the cone excitations randomize the system while the influence of excitations outside the cone is negligible , which is essentially a lieb - robinson - type argument . in a very similar fashion , one can argue that the speed at which correlations build up in time is governed by these bounds ( see also ref .",
    "again , the above speed is an upper bound to which one can correlate separate regions starting from an uncorrelated state under quenched , non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "as mentioned before , these bounds have immediate implication to the evaluation of capacities of harmonic chains , when being used as convenient quantum channels .",
