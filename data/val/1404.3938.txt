    "there is observational evidence that the photospheric magnetic field is very inhomogeneous at small scales ( _ i.e. _ @xmath3 km ) ( see , _ e.g. _ for a review ) .",
    "early magnetographic observations showed that the magnetic field strengths evaluated using spectral lines with similar characteristics but different magnetic sensitivity ( _ i.e. _ different lande factor [ @xmath4 ) can vary by up to a factor of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this effect was interpreted as an indicator of unresolved multi - component structure with intense magnetic flux tubes embedded in a non - magnetic atmosphere or an atmosphere with weaker ambient field ( figure  [ f - sketch ] ) .",
    "it is believed that these small - scale magnetic flux tubes may account for nearly @xmath6 of the photospheric magnetic flux outside sunspots @xcite .",
    "most existing instruments in the optical range can directly resolve features with sizes of @xmath7 mm .",
    "hence , here by `` unresolved '' we mean spatial scales @xmath8  mm . the most direct measurements of unresolved field structure were carried out using speckle interferometry in the line fe  i  5250.2  @xmath9 @xcite and revealed magnetic elements with a field strength of a few kg and sizes of @xmath10  km , which , perhaps , can be considered as an upper limit on the diameters of small - scale magnetic flux tubes . also , @xcite ( @xcite ) observed full stokes profiles in magneto - sensitive infrared fe  i lines 15648  @xmath9 and 15652  @xmath9 and found two types of small - scale magnetic elements : stronger elements with the field of @xmath11  kg and sizes @xmath12  km and weaker ones with the field strength of @xmath13  g and sizes about @xmath14  km .",
    "the two types of magnetic elements were attributed to network and inter - network flux tubes .",
    "it was also concluded that the inter - network magnetic field elements have rather short lifetimes of about few hours .",
    "there are a number of indirect measurements of unresolved magnetic field structure characteristics .",
    "estimations of horizontal sizes of intense magnetic flux tubes vary significantly from tens of kilometers @xcite to hundreds of kilometers @xcite .",
    "comparison of the effective field values obtained using spectral lines with different magnetic sensitivity shows that the magnetic field in such flux tubes is about @xmath15  kg , although there are some indications that it could be substantially higher @xcite .",
    "the main reason behind such large discrepancies in estimations is that even the two - component model , which is used to fit the observational data , has about ten free parameters , such as magnetic field strengths , field inclinations , and surface brightness for both components , along with the filling factor and other parameters .",
    "hence , diagnostics of the small - scale magnetic field require some realistic assumptions about the field structure to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "for instance , it might be safe to assume that the intense , unresolved flux tubes within a sampled area are almost identical @xcite and the key free parameters are the strength and vertical gradient of magnetic field in these flux tubes , and the filling factor .",
    "the fine structure of the magnetic field in solar flares is understood even less than that in the quiet photosphere .",
    "there is strong evidence of unresolved magnetic field in flares , but their diagnostics is a challenging task , because of the associated temperature and velocity inhomogeneities at small scales .",
    "furthermore , it is not always possible to distinguish between horizontal and vertical inhomogeneities at sub - telescopic scales .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) observed full stokes profiles of several fe  i lines in order to study the structure of magnetic field in the 2b solar flare of 16  june  1989 .",
    "it was found that the small - scale field strength was between @xmath16 and @xmath17  kg , and it substantially changed during the flare .",
    "it was also found that the filling factor decreased with time .",
    "more recently , the new generation of solar space observatories along with advanced ground - based instruments have provided more evidence for fine structure of the magnetic field in solar flares .",
    "thus , full - stokes - imaging spectropolarimetry of a c - class flare with the interferometric bidimensional spectropolarimeter ( ibis ) shows that stokes profiles are highly irregular , indicating the presence of unresolved multi - component magnetic and velocity fields @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the instrument ( up to 0.33  arcsec , or 240  km ) provides the upper limit for the sizes of these unresolved magnetic elements .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) used the data from the synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun ( solis ) vector - spectrograph in order to investigate the evolution of magnetic field in an x - class flare and also found that the stokes profiles demonstrate complex , highly asymmetric structure that may be explained by a multi - component velocity field or by substantial perturbations of the spectral line profile due to heating .",
    "in addition , they show that a small patch of the photosphere , co - spatial with hard x - ray footpoints observed by ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) , exhibits an unresolved fine structure .",
    "a quantitative estimation of a typical cross - section of small - scale magnetic elements can be made based on the analysis by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "they carried out observations of the coronal rain using the crisp imaging spectro - polarimeter ( crisp ) at the swedish solar telescope and concluded that the coronal rain consists of elements with a typical width of @xmath18310  km .",
    "the structure and temporal variations of the small - scale magnetic field during flares may be related to the fast evolution of magnetic field in the corona and , therefore , the small - scale field structure in active regions and especially during solar flares , deserves more attention .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to study unresolved structure of magnetic field at the photosphere during solar flares using two different approaches .",
    "the first approach is based on the analysis of the relationship between magnetic field strengths measured using different spectral lines and their lande factors [ @xmath4 , which is similar to the method applied in magnetographic observations .",
    "the second approach is based on the analysis of fine structure of @xmath1 stokes - profile splitting , which is possible only in observations with relatively high spectral resolution .",
    "observations of 13 solar flares of different classes are analysed ; their details are given in table  [ tabobj ] .",
    "for comparison , we also present observations of a plage and a sunspot .",
    "the observational data were obtained on the echelle spectrograph of the horizontal solar telescope of the kyiv national university @xcite .",
    "this spectrograph can simultaneously record a spectrum in the range from 3800  @xmath9 to 6600  @xmath9 with spectral resolution of about 30 m@xmath9 in the green part of the spectrum .",
    "the spatial resolution is about @xmath2  arcsec , depending on atmospheric conditions , which means that the observed spectra correspond to areas of about @xmath19  mm@xmath20 .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath21  seconds .",
    "all of the spectra have been observed during the main ( or `` thermal '' ) phase of flares ( see table 1 ) at the locations with brightest h@xmath0 emission .",
    "specific slit locations are shown in figure  [ f - sketches ] .",
    ".solar flares considered in the present study .",
    "columns from the left to the right show : date , time the spectrum was taken , onset time in x - rays , time of maximum intensity in h@xmath0 , flare location on the disc , flare class . the onset time , maximum time , location and class for flares 4    13 are taken from noaa solar event reports ( http://www.swpc.noaa.gov[www.swpc.noaa.gov ] ) .",
    "the spectra correspond to the locations shown in figure  [ f - sketches ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      synthetic line profiles allow us to evaluate the typical error in zeeman effect measurements . figure  [ f - biserror ] demonstrates the error in bisector splitting values in 5233  @xmath9 line , while figure  [ f - raterror ] shows the typical error in @xmath22 measurements .",
    "it can be seen , that the error in bisector splitting measurements in the range @xmath23  m@xmath9 is @xmath24  g when the noise amplitude is 1% ( of the continuum intensity ) ; this error is @xmath25  g and @xmath26  g when the noise amplitudes are 2% and 4% , respectively . in the observations presented in section  [ observ ] ,",
    "typical noise level is around 2% and , hence , the error is @xmath25  g , which is close to that evaluated from the telluric line observations ",
    "@xmath3  g. it should be noted , that the error is higher at the line core ( @xmath27  m@xmath9 for the 5233  @xmath9 line ) and close to the wings ( _ i.e. _ at large @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the error is higher for lower @xmath29 values , given the same noise amplitude .",
    "this also means that measurements in narrow lines , such as 52471.@xmath9 and 5250.2  @xmath9 , have substantially lower error .",
    "@xmath22 values are much less sensitive to the noise .",
    "thus , the noise with an amplitude of 1% yields mean square error of @xmath30  g for 5247.1  @xmath9 and 5250.2  @xmath9 lines and @xmath31  g forthe 5233  @xmath9 line . for noise amplitudes of 2%",
    "these values are @xmath32  g and @xmath33  g , and for the 4% noise these errors reach @xmath34  g and @xmath35  g , respectively .",
    "hence , the comparison of @xmath22 field values deduced from spectral lines with different magnetic sensitivities would provide more reliable information regarding unresolved magnetic field structure than bisector splitting functions .",
    "our observational data demonstrates that , similarly to the quiet photopshere @xcite , the magnetic field at the photospheric level in flares is very inhomogeneous at unresolved scales .",
    "the observational picture is more complicated than in the quiet photosphere and in plages due to the presence of emission and fast plasma flows along the line - of - sight .",
    "the comparison of the magnetic field values deduced from spectral lines with different lande factor @xmath36 shows that the effective field strength @xmath22 increases with @xmath36 ( see section  [ observ - lr ] ) , in contrast with what is normally observed in the quiet photosphere .",
    "analysis of the synthetic @xmath1 stokes profiles for two - component fields shows that this is possible in two cases : when the strong magnetic field has its polarity opposite to the polarity of the weaker ambient field or when the spectral components corresponding to the unresolved field ( c2 ) show emission .",
    "the presence of very strong field of opposite polarity should be associated with high current densities .",
    "hence , the second possibility , with emission from intense magnetic flux tubes , looks more realistic .",
    "furthermore , the second option seems to be more viable as emission peaks are often observed in metallic lines in moderate and bright flares .",
    "the fine structure of @xmath1 profiles observed in flares has been studied using bisector splitting functions ( @xmath37 ) ( section  [ observ - bs ] ) .",
    "it is known that the centre of a fraunhofer line is formed predominantly in cooler regions , while the wings correspond to higher temperatures and are formed slightly deeper .",
    "hence , the average trend of @xmath37 can be considered as the result of corellation between the magnetic field and the temperature .",
    "hence , it is very unlikely , that the decrease of @xmath38 with @xmath28 is the result of vertical magnetic field gradients , as it would imply magnetic field increase with height .",
    "horizontal inhomogeneity of the magnetic field seems to be rather realistic explanation for the observed trends of @xmath37 , with higher magnetic field corresponding to lower temperatures and turbulent velocities .",
    "analysis of the bisector splitting in synthetic @xmath1 stokes profiles shows that the localized extrema , similar to those seen in figure  [ f - bsall ] , can be explained by the presence of narrow emission or absorption components of the spectral line with substantial shift @xmath38 .",
    "thus , based on synthetic profiles , it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the field , that would result in peaks on the bisector splitting profiles .",
    "the peak at @xmath39  m@xmath9 in the case of the line similar to fe  i  @xmath40  @xmath9 can be caused by field strength @xmath41  kg .",
    "however , these estimations are very sensitive to the width of the main component of the spectral line , and should be used with caution .",
    "in general , our preliminary results confirm previous conclusions that the photospheric magnetic field in flares has at least two components .",
    "furthermore , our study shows that in flares thermodynamic conditions in the intense magnetic flux tubes are very different from conditions outside .",
    "the most interesting feature that has been revealed by this study , is an apparent link between the strong unresolved field and emission in flares .",
    "this effect can be easily seen in observed profiles : the zeeman split of emission peaks in line cores is normally bigger than that of the absorption component of a spectral line .",
    "this finding could be quite important for the flare phenomenology .",
    "there are several possible explanations for emission observed in photospheric lines : atoms can be excited due to non - thermal particle precipitation , heating by propagating waves , or by conduction . in any case",
    ", it is very likely that the observed emission is directly related to energy release in the corona .",
    "hence , the revealed connection between the emission in metallic lines and stronger field component may indicate that the intense unresolved photospheric magnetic elements are topologically connected to the coronal field , while weak ambient photospheric magnetic fluxes only form the low - level magnetic canopy ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) .",
    "this study gives a rough estimate of the backgound and strong photospheric magnetic field components .",
    "obviously , more work needs to be done before these can be evaluated more reliably .",
    "observationally , higher precision may be achieved by using combination of different methods , for instance , by using the data obtained from zeeman and hanle measurements .",
    "this , however , would not help to answer the question about the size of the small - scale magnetic elements . in order to address this problem , direct observations with higher spatial resolution",
    "are needed and these are likely to be possible with future missions .",
    "current instruments provide reasonably high spatial resolution of @xmath42 km , but this is still not sufficient for reliable investigation of magnetic field fine structure .",
    "thus , high - resolution magnetic field maps of flares 12 and 13 obtained with helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) onboard solar dynamic observatory ( sdo ) show that the field is still very inhomogeneous even on a scale of one pixel .",
    "alternatively , observations in other spectral bands may provide an opportunity to resolve very small scales .",
    "for example , future solar observations with atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) would be able to provide polarimetric data in sub - thz range with mili - arcsec resolution , possibly giving a unique insight into solar magnetic field structure @xcite .",
    "additionally , local helioseismology may provide an indirect estimations , as @xmath43-mode scattering and absorption can be sensitive to the magnetic flux tube sizes ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ; ; ; ) .",
    "finally , more theoretical work concerning the radiative transfer in strongly inhomogeneous magnetic field is needed in order to explain adequately the observed fine structure of stokes profiles .",
