    "over the past two decades there has been an increasing interest in the nonequilibrium behavior of spatially extended systems modeled as ensembles of simple dynamical units coupled to each other .",
    "the collective evolution of such discrete coupled systems often exhibits qualitatively different behavior from that of the single units .",
    "an example of a system that has attracted a great deal of attention is a collection of a large number of coupled limit - cycle ( phase ) oscillators with randomly distributed natural frequencies  @xcite .",
    "this system has been invoked as a simple model for coupled chemical , biological or physical oscillators .",
    "a most spectacular collective phenomenon discovered with this model is a synchronization phase transition involving mutual entrainment of the oscillators through frequency and phase locking .",
    "however , in this model the coupling is assumed to be sufficiently weak that the amplitude is not affected . as a result",
    ", the model can not describe amplitude instabilities .",
    "a system that does exhibit a rich variety of amplitude instabilities consists of coupled parametric oscillators and is the subject of this paper  @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature on single parametric oscillators with periodically  @xcite or stochastically  @xcite modulated frequencies , perhaps also subject to thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of linear and nonlinear , deterministic and stochastic , systems that exhibit energetic instabilities can be modeled as simple parametric oscillators undergoing the amplitude instability known as  parametric resonance\"@xcite .",
    "it is therefore rather surprising that there is actually little work on coupled parametric oscillators .",
    "work previous to our own that we are aware of is limited to a global parametric modulation that acts on all the oscillators in exactly the same way .",
    "examples include parametrically pumped electrons in a penning trap  @xcite , pattern formation under global resonant forcing  @xcite , time - periodic loading of an elastic system  @xcite , and nonlinear parametrically driven lattices  @xcite .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we introduced a very simple , analytically solvable model of coupled parametric oscillators consisting of an infinite set of globally coupled harmonic oscillators subject to time - periodic piecewise - constant modulations with randomly distributed quenched phases (  quenched \" in this context means that the phase of the frequency modulation of each oscillator is set at time @xmath0 and then remains unchanged ) .",
    "we showed the appearance of a collective parametric instability : even though each individual oscillator is in its stable parameter domain , the average amplitude of the coupled system may diverge monotonically .",
    "this collective instability occurs when the amplitude of parametric modulation is sufficiently large that the instantaneous frequency of the oscillators temporarily becomes imaginary .",
    "the instability is re - entrant with respect to the strength of the coupling of the oscillators and persists in the overdamped limit . in the presence of a saturating nonlinearity  @xcite",
    ", it generates a pitchfork bifurcation , corresponding to a genuine second - order nonequilibrium phase transition ( implying the spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetry and ergodicity ) .    the purpose of this paper is to show that _ in addition _ to the instability described by monotonic growth of the mean amplitude , the globally coupled infinite system can also undergo transitions to a collective oscillatory instability with an intrinsic frequency that is not connected in a simple way to either the frequencies of the individual oscillators or to the frequency of the external modulation .",
    "a saturating nonlinearity turns this instability into a hopf bifurcation generating a limit - cycle with the concomitant breaking of temporal symmetry and ergodicity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that even when the modulation amplitude is very small , monotonic growth can still occur but via a mechanism entirely different from that identified previously .    in trying to explain these collective behaviors ,",
    "one is impressed by the similarities with a simple model introduced earlier  @xcite of _ two _ coupled parametric oscillators modulated periodically with a fixed phase difference @xmath1 between their modulations .",
    "the behavior of this dimer when @xmath2 is remarkably similar to that of the globally coupled infinite system , and the roots of the instabilities observed in the latter are already present in this simple system . at an even more primary level",
    "the seeds of these collective instabilities can be traced back to behaviors of single oscillators . in general",
    "an individual oscillator tends to synchronize with the external modulation whereas the coupling induces mutual synchronization between oscillators .",
    "these two synchronization tendencies can not always be satisfied simultaneously . coupling between oscillators",
    "can then be seen as leading to a sort of `` selection '' among the single oscillator modes , enhancing some ( destabilization ) and smoothing out others ( stabilization ) .    in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the globally coupled model .",
    "section  [ sec : free ] is a review of the properties of a single linear parametric oscillator .",
    "section  [ sec : collective ] establishes the mathematical setting for the analysis of the globally coupled system as a mean field problem , and typical numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section  [ sec : phase ] we collect these results in the form of a phase diagram that characterizes the behavior of the coupled system as the modulation parameters are varied .",

    "but in spite of these differences and most importantly , the principal resonance region ( @xmath166 ) again shows an almost perfect match .    in the dimer",
    ", competition between two kinds of synchronization plays a key role in the destabilization of the system : on the one hand , synchronization between each oscillator and its modulation ; on the other hand , synchronization between the two oscillators .",

    "larger values of @xmath64 favor the former , while larger values of @xmath96 favor the latter .",
    "when the coupling is weak , the energy difference between symmetric and antisymmetric modes is small and both can be excited .",
    "in this case , the individual oscillators are nearly independent and the stability diagram of the dimer is similar to that of a single oscillator . as the coupling strength increases , the energy of antisymmetric oscillations increases until eventually only in - phase oscillations are energetically accessible .",

    "the stability diagram of the anti - phased dimer in the @xmath170 plane shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : krkplane ] illustrates the above story .",
    "first , consider @xmath171 , where a single oscillator is in the main parametric instability region ( @xmath61 , the first light grey region in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : krkplane ] ) .",
    "for small @xmath96 , the dimer is also unstable and still dominated by the antisymmetric mode ( even though the symmetric mode _ can not _ disappear , as mentioned above ) .",
    "however , as @xmath96 increases , excitation of the antisymmetric mode becomes more difficult and the symmetric mode becomes dominant , which stabilizes the system . when @xmath172 a single oscillator is stable ( @xmath44 , between the dark and light grey regions ) . in this parameter region , individual oscillators do not have to be synchronous to the modulation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] ) .",
    "they are free to become mutually synchronized and the system becomes unstable above a certain coupling strength .",
    "since the symmetric mode dominates , this instability persists even for large @xmath96 . finally , when @xmath173 , the single oscillator is again in an unstable region ( @xmath60 , the dark grey region ) .",
    "although the situation is similar to the first case , the individual oscillators now have a zero - frequency mode which is not subject to synchronization with the modulation .",
    "therefore , the zero - frequency mode of the two oscillators can be mutually synchronized , which produces a monotonic growth of the mean .",
    "again , this instability does not have strong dependence on the coupling strength and persists even for large @xmath96 .    the good agreement between the dimer and mean field models",
    "is not merely a coincidence .",
    "consider one particular test oscillator in the globally coupled system . now",
    "define the group of its `` friends '' as the set of all oscillators whose modulation phase lies within an interval of @xmath174 around its phase .",
    "the group of its `` enemies '' comprises the set of all other oscillators , whose average modulation phase is opposite to that of the test oscillator .",
    "when the oscillators are synchronized to the modulations , `` friends '' are also mutually synchronized to one another , regardless of the coupling .",
    "when the coupling increases , there is a competition between two kinds of synchronization : synchronization between the `` enemies '' and `` friends '' , and synchronization with their own modulations .",
    "this situation is similar to the anti - phased dimer , which helps explain the remarkable similarity between the instability diagrams of the dimer and mean field models .",
    "notice that this description becomes _ exact _ in the quenched limit , where the `` friends '' and `` enemies '' can be represented respectively by @xmath175 and @xmath176 . from this perspective",
    ", the choice @xmath154 for the dimer appears as a natural one , being not only a particularly symmetric case in the general dimer problem  @xcite but also the effective phase difference between the two groups .",
    "we have investigated collective instabilities of an infinite set of globally coupled linear oscillators driven by time - periodic piecewise linear modulations with random initial phases .",
    "these instabilities occur in certain parameter regimes ( and not in others ) , and we have produced phase diagrams as a function of system parameters indicating detailed stability boundaries and types of instabilities .",
    "instabilities arise from phase synchronization ( although not all phase synchronization leads to instability ) , and there are two possible competing synchronization mechanisms : synchronization of individual oscillators with the external modulation (  modulation synchronization \" ) , and mutual synchronization between oscillators (  mutual synchronization \" ) . in the absence of the external modulation , only mutual synchronization is possible . on the other hand ,",
    "when the coupling is absent , a single oscillator in parametric resonance condition ( @xmath55 ) synchronizes with the external modulation .",
    "note that parametric instability of a single oscillator requires modulation synchronization , and in general _ any _ instability requires an external modulation to pump energy into the system .    in the presence of external modulation with random phases _ and _ coupling , even in a parameter regime where either alone would lead to synchronization , it is not possible for both types of synchronization to occur simultaneously .",
    "intuition might lead to the conclusion that sufficiently strong coupling would favor mutual synchronization thereby destroying modulation synchronization ( and hence stabilizing the system ) .",
    "intuition might also lead one to conclude that weak coupling necessarily results in a dominance of modulation synchronization and hence to instabilities of individual oscillators not related to one another .",
    "however , we have shown that this intuitive picture would be incomplete because it does not account for the existence of _ collective _ parametric instabilities due to the coupling and entirely absent in a single parametric oscillator . here",
    "we discuss our results in terms of the two competing synchronization mechanisms .    in a globally coupled model , the individual oscillators",
    "are coupled to the mean @xmath113 , and thus mutual synchronization can be thought of as synchronization between the individuals and the mean .",
    "note that there is no mutual synchronization when @xmath105 ( because if there were , the mean would not be zero ) .",
    "now suppose we are in the parameter regime @xmath61 where individual uncoupled oscillators are parametrically unstable . when these oscillators are coupled , one can imagine one of two possible scenarios .",
    "if the coupling leads to mutual synchronization , the individual oscillators can no longer be synchronous with the external modulation and therefore the coupled system has been stabilized by the coupling . on the other hand , if the coupling does not lead to mutual synchronization but instead there is modulation synchronization , then the oscillators may be individually unstable but with @xmath105 .",
    "our results show that the second scenario is the correct one for sufficiently small values of @xmath96 , as shown in the yellow regions of incoherent instability in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaselowgamma ] .",
    "modulation synchronization has  won \" . on the other hand , there is a coupling energy cost to the lack of mutual synchronization , which slows down the instability of individual oscillators relative to their uncoupled amplitude growth . for larger",
    "@xmath96 the first scenario takes over , and the yellow region disappears above a certain value of the coupling .",
    "next suppose that we are in the other parametric resonance regime , @xmath60 .",
    "the situation is in some ways similar to the previous case but there is a major difference : there is now a mode , the @xmath69 mode , whose frequency is zero and which therefore ( contrary to the other modes ) need not ( indeed can not ) synchronize to the modulation",
    ". the amplitude of this mode can grow monotonically in either direction , and the coupling among oscillators leads to a tendency for the zero - frequency mode of all the individual oscillators to move in the same direction . thus while the growth rate of the @xmath177 modes is reduced by coupling due to the lack of mutual synchronization , that of the @xmath69 mode is enhanced because the coupling fosters mutual synchronization of this mode .",
    "if the individual oscillators are not in regimes of parametric instability ( @xmath44 ) , there is no synchronization to the modulation and the oscillators are free to synchronize with one another . mutual synchronization is thus established and the mean @xmath113 becomes oscillatory with the same frequency as that of individual oscillators in the coupled system .",
    "the oscillatory mean drives the system into unstable states via the mean field coupling .",
    "we have found that the instability bifurcation diagram for a simple anti - phased dimer model reproduces the phase diagram for the mean field system with surprising accuracy .    in the absence of external modulation , a dimer has two eigenmodes : symmetric or mutually synchronized ( lower energy ) , and antisymmetric or mutually anti - synchronized ( higher energy ) . in the presence of time - periodic piecewise linear modulations which are exactly out of phase on the two coupled oscillators ( @xmath154 ) , a competition between these two modes ( which are no longer eigenmodes ) ensues .",
    "this competition is in many ways similar to the competition between modulation synchronization and mutual synchronization described for the globally coupled system , and here again it determines the stability of a dimer . when the coupling is weak , the energy difference between symmetric and antisymmetric modes is small and both can be excited . in this case , the individual oscillators are nearly independent and the stability diagram of the dimer is similar to that of a single oscillator .",
    "the synchronization of each oscillator with its modulation dominates the behavior , and instabilities thus represent boundless excitation of the antisymmetric mode . with increasing coupling the energy of the antisymmetric mode increases until it is too high",
    "to be excited .",
    "only the symmetric mode can be excited , i.e. , the oscillators become mutually synchronized .",
    "the synchronization with the modulation is thus destroyed and the associated parametric instability is suppressed .    although the similarity between the dimer and globally coupled models is remarkable , they also exhibit various important differences . in the dimer model ,",
    "mutual synchronization involves only two oscillators . on the other hand ,",
    "in the global coupling model an oscillator must be synchronous with essentially all others to create collective motion .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath178 , the collective instability in the globally coupled system is a genuine phase transition , whereas the instabilities in the dimer are simple bifurcations .",
    "nevertheless , the stability boundaries and dynamics of the mean amplitudes in both cases show impressive similarities .",
    "an interesting case that is in some sense  in between \" these two and that promises interesting new features is that of a one - dimensional chain of oscillators with nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "when the phase of the modulations of the oscillators in the chain is chosen at random , there is a significant chance that both neighbors of any given oscillator have a phase  similar \" ( suitably defined within some range ) to its phase . in this case",
    ", the middle oscillator can easily establish simultaneously both mutual synchronization with its neighbors and synchronization with the modulation .",
    "therefore , locally this oscillator could become unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "if the neighbors of a given oscillator are modulated with phases opposite to its own modulation phase , that oscillator may be stabilized .",
    "therefore , the spatial pattern of the modulation phase is expected to play an important role and instability may become wavelength dependent , suggesting spatial pattern formation .",
