    "modern cosmological observations suggest that dark matter is composed of a yet - unidentified elementary particle  ( e.g.  ) .",
    "however , direct evidence for dark matter particles has proved elusive .",
    "experiments that search for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , one of the most plausible particle dark matter candidates , seek to identify the scattering of a wimp with a nucleus in an underground detector  @xcite .",
    "constraining , and eventually measuring , the wimp mass and cross section requires a precise understanding of the dark matter spatial and velocity distribution at the earth s location in the milky way  @xcite .",
    "dark matter is distributed in halos extending beyond the visible components of galaxies ; many statistical properties including the formation and structure of these halos have been well characterized by simulations . despite the diversity in the merger and accretion histories of dark matter halos of different masses ,",
    "cosmological simulations have long suggested near universality in the density profiles of halos  @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to connect this universality in the density profile to the dark matter velocity distribution function  ( vdf )  @xcite . however , there is no well - established model or description for the vdf that has been rigorously tested with cosmological simulations .",
    "both the implications for direct detection and the quest for a theoretical understanding of the phase - space distribution in dark matter halos motivate a study of the vdf . under specific , and perhaps too stringent , assumptions , including isolation , equilibrium , spherical symmetry , and isotropy , the vdf may be determined uniquely from the density profile . for example , with all assumptions named above and a known density profile , the ergodic distribution function can be calculated using eddington s formula  @xcite . although useful as an analytic framework ,",
    "these assumptions are unlikely to strictly hold for halos formed via hierarchical merging .    in absence of an understanding from first principles , a practical approach to study the vdf involves appealing directly to dark matter halos with a wide range of physical properties in cosmological simulations . quantifying the vdf directly from cosmological simulations would provide a better empirically - motivated framework to predict signals in direct detection experiments . furthermore , with a parametrized vdf , it becomes more tractable to study the relations between the vdf and other physical quantities of the halos , such as mass , density profile , shape , and formation history .    in this study , we use a suite of dark matter halos from cosmological simulations to study the vdfs at different radii of these halos .",
    "we identify a similarity in vdfs among a wide range of halos with different masses , concentrations , and other physical quantities , that depends primarily on @xmath0 , the radius at which it is measured divided by the scale radius of the density profile .",
    "we further notice that neither standard maxwell  boltzmann models  @xcite nor models that have been previously proposed to describe collisionless structures  @xcite are able to provide an adequate description of cosmological vdfs .",
    "instead , we describe the distribution of the norm of velocity ( in the galactic rest frame ) more accurately with an empirical model : @xmath1 where the normalization constant  @xmath2 is chosen such that the integral @xmath3 equals the number of particles in the region of interest .",
    "note that in this parameterization the vdf approaches an exponential distribution instead of a gaussian distribution at the low - velocity end . with this model",
    ", we quantify the scatter in the vdf from a variety of sources , including halo - to - halo scatter , scatter from finite particle sampling , and scatter from the uncertain position of the earth within a given halo .",
    "we further identify the largest uncertainties that currently exist in our understanding of the vdf at the location of the earth in our galaxy , and quantify their relevance for inferences from direct detection experiments .",
    "to identify the relevant physical quantities which affect the vdf and to quantify scatter in the distributions among different halos in cosmological simulations , we must examine a large number of halos across a wide range of mass .",
    "we also need high resolution to reduce sampling error and distinguish differences in vdfs for different parameters .    in this study",

    "we examine the vdfs at a range of radii .",

    ", we assign the escape velocity ( @xmath14 ) as the spherically - averaged @xmath14 of all particles in the shell .",
    "we have verified that @xmath14 determined from this method is consistent with the same quantity deduced from the best - fitting spherically - averaged smooth density profile .",

    "if instead the velocity is normalized by the circular velocity at each radius rather than the escape velocity , this trend will be slightly weakened but still significant . this trend in @xmath0",
    "is not surprising because the vdf heavily depends on the gravitational potential .",
    "if the density profiles of simulated halos can be described by the nfw profile , which is a function of @xmath0 only ( up to a normalization constant ) , the vdf should mostly depend on @xmath0 until the isolated nfw potential breaks down at large radius .",
    "the above trend is robust for halo masses down to @xmath24 m@xmath25 , as shown by the bolshoi simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdf_stack_radius ] .",
    "the scatter of the vdfs in the low - mass halos considered is somewhat larger due to resolution .",
    "however , when the high - mass halos are downsampled to have the same particle number , the spreads in the stacked vdf are comparable to the low - mass halos .",
    "we further investigated the impact of a variety of parameters characterizing the halo on the shape of the vdf , and found that for a fixed value of @xmath0 , the halo - to - halo scatter in the vdfs is not significantly reduced when binning on concentration , shape , or formation history .",
    "a detailed discussion on this halo - to - halo scatter is in section [ sec : scatter ] .",
    "the dark matter velocity distribution in halos is set by a sequence of mergers and accretion .",
    "the process of violent relaxation  @xcite may be responsible for the resulting near - equilibrium distributions observed in dark matter halos and in galaxies .",
    "these near - equilibrium distributions explain why existing vdf models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , including the standard halo model ( shm ) , king model , the double power - law model , and the tsallis model , are all variants of the maxwell  boltzmann distribution .",
    "recent studies have shown that the widely - used shm , which is a maxwell  boltzmann distribution with a cut - off put in by hand , is inconsistent with the vdf found in a handful of individual simulations  @xcite and in the study of rotation curve data @xcite .",
    "the double power - law model was proposed to suppress the tail of the distribution , by raising the shm to the power of a parameter @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the tsallis model replaces the gaussian in maxwell  boltzmann distribution with a @xmath27-gaussian , which approaches to a gaussian as @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the tsallis model provides better fit to simulations with baryons  @xcite , although this conclusion may be affected by the relatively low resolution of the simulations .",
    "in contrast , our empirical model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdf ] ) , is not based on a gaussian distribution but rather on an exponential distribution .",

    "our vdf model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdf ] ) , consists of two terms : the exponential term and the cut - off term .",
    "the origin of the the exponential term can be explained by the anisotropy in velocity space .",
    "[ fig : vdf_gaussian ] shows the distributions , the dispersion , and the kurtosis of the velocity vectors along the three axes of the spherical coordinate .",
    "kurtosis is a measure of the peakedness of a distribution , defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the velocity of the @xmath40-th particle along one axis , and this value is zero for the normal distribution .",
    "the ratios of dispersion between the three axes are close to one at small radii , and the ratios increase with radius .",
    "the kurtosis , on the other hand , is in general non - zero and decreases with radius .",
    "an important consequence of the non - zero kurtosis is that even if the dispersion along the three axes are similar ( anisotropy parameter @xmath41 ) , the velocity vectors do _ not _ follow an isotropic multivariate normal distribution in any coordinate system ( even after a local coordinate transformations ) . in other words , as long as there exists either anisotropy or non - zero kurtosis in a certain coordinate , the norms of the velocity vectors will not follow the maxwell  boltzmann distribution . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : vdf_gaussian ] shows that in the simulations , one always has non - zero kurtosis and/or anisotropy .",
    "other simulations also indicate that the velocity vectors of dark matter particles have anisotropy  @xcite and non - zero kurtosis  @xcite .",
    "we further found that if the ratios of dispersion between the three axes of a multivariate normal distribution are around 0.2 to 0.6 , the norms of those random vectors will follow a distribution which resembles our model without the cut - off term , @xmath42 .",
    "( for a formal discussion on this topic , see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "this suggests that if one can find a coordinate system where the distributions of the velocity components are all distributed normally ( with zero kurtosis ) , there will be a larger difference between the dispersion along the three axes in this new coordinate system than in the spherical coordinate .     and",

    "the dashed lines are only to guide the eyes . ]",
    "the @xmath47 term in our vdf model introduces a cut - off at the escape velocity .",
    "it further suppresses the vdf tail more than the exponential term alone does . despite that this cut - off term",
    "has the form of a power - law in ( binding ) energy , the best - fit values of the parameter @xmath48 does not necessarily reflect the `` asymptotic '' power - law index @xmath26 , defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the ( binding ) energy distribution function .",
    "the relation between @xmath26 and the outer density slope has been studied in the literature  @xcite . however , because @xmath51 deviates from its asymptotic value @xmath26 rapidly as @xmath52 deviates from zero , the asymptotic power - law index @xmath26 could be very different from the best - fit power - law index for the vdf tail ( e.g.  @xmath53 ) .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the vdf power - law tail could be set by recently - accreted subhalos that have not been fully phase - mixed  @xcite , and hence has no simple relation with the density profile .",
    "in high - resolution simulated dark matter halos , particles stripped off of a still - surviving subhalo are seen to significantly impact the tail of the vdf .",

    "we do not expect the milky way has had a recent major merger with @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates that for possible milky way host halos , one can exclude these systems with recent major mergers , and there will be no remaining correlation between formation time and @xmath58 .    for milky way size halos",

    "[ fig : vdf_scatter_other ] illustrates that @xmath55 does not grow with the local density slope when one only looks at a fixed @xmath0 ( points with the same color ) , but it does grow with @xmath0 when the local density slope is fixed .",

    "when deducing the direct detection event rate from cosmological simulations , the primary sources of uncertainty arise from : ( i ) finite particle sampling of the vdf , ( ii ) intrinsic scatter from physical processes that affect the vdf during the halo formation process ( i.e.  the halo - to - halo scatter ) , ( iii ) the quality of the fit and the validity of a smooth model , ( iv ) the observational constraint on @xmath0 for the milky way , ( v ) the variation of the vdfs in various directions at a fixed radius , and ( vi ) the impact of baryons .",
