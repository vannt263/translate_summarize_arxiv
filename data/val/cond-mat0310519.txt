    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the @xmath0 phase of iron under pressure @xcite , several observations have hinted that the electron pairing has an unconventional origin .",
    "firstly , the restricted pressure range of the superconducting ( sc ) state is hard to explain by bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the partial resistive transitions observed implied an unusual sensitivity to disorder , a characteristic property of certain unconventional superconductors .",
    "proximity to the ferromagnetic phase suggests that spin fluctuations could be involved in the relevant electronic interactions .",
    "subsequent experiments confirmed the unusual properties of @xmath0-fe .",
    "an attempt to observe superconductivity in a high purity commercial sample failed _ [ sample # 0 , goodfellow 4n+ , with impurities ( ppm ) : ag @xmath7 1 ; al @xmath7 1;cu @xmath7 1 ; si 1]_. however , to achieve the dimensions necessary for a pressure experiment , the sample had been rolled down to a thickness of around 3@xmath8 m , introducing disorder which significantly raised its residual resistivity .",
    "further experiments succeeded in obtaining complete superconducting resistive transitions @xcite when special care was taken over the choice of samples and their preparation , to avoid not only chemical impurities but structural disorder due to mechanical work .",
    "other indications about the nature of the superconductivity come from the normal state resistivity of the @xmath0 phase at low temperature .",
    "this appeared , at a pressure @xmath9gpa , to follow a @xmath10 power law with a strongly enhanced prefactor over a broad range of temperature , a @xmath11-dependence expected of a nearly ferromagnetic fermi - liquid ( nffl ) .",
    "the presence of ferromagnetic fluctuations could imply @xmath12-wave triplet superconductivity , a scenario suggested in the case of zrzn@xmath13 @xcite , which has many features in common with iron ( partial resistive transitions , non - fermi liquid power law , sensitivity to disorder ) .",
    "this stands in contrast with band structure calculations @xcite where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are expected to dominate the ground state , and @xmath12-wave superconductivity is not favoured .",
    "the nature of the pressure - driven bcc - hcp @xmath14-@xmath0 transition complicates the situation .",
    "the transition is martensitic @xcite , and its pressure width ( but not its hysteretic behaviour ) is highly dependent on the pressure conditions @xcite . in the quasi - hydrostatic conditions of the steatite medium used in our experiments , where pressure gradients are up to 5%",
    ", this should lead to a transition spread over at least 10 gpa , very similar to the sc pressure range .",
    "the superconductivity may therefore be somehow linked with the structural transition itself , rather than being an intrinsic property of the @xmath0 phase . in this series of experiments",
    "we have not addressed this question , though it may turn out to be a crucial one .",
    "future studies using different pressure media should help to clarify the issue .",
    "the high pressure experiments were carried out using the same bridgman anvil technique used for ref .",
    "the aim of these follow - up measurements was to explore further the role of structural disorder in the appearance or otherwise of superconductivity , and to confirm the non - fermi liquid @xmath10 behaviour of the normal state resistivity in the @xmath0 phase .",
    "we wished to investigate whether superconductivity could be destroyed , and/or recovered or induced by mechanical work and annealing , respectively .",
    "there were four samples in this study , three came from the superconducting batches reported in @xcite , one from dresden ( # 6 ) and two from osaka ( # 3,4 ) .",
    "the remaining sample ( # 5 ) _ [ goodfellow 99.998% fe , impurities ( ppm ) : ag @xmath7 1 ; al @xmath7 1 ; cu @xmath7 1 ; mg 1 ; mn 1 ; ni @xmath7 1 ] _ was obtained from the same commercial metallurgical supplier as # 0 .",
    "no trace of superconductivity had been found in a previous investigation of sample # 0 , where the residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) was 15 .",
    "( the rrr is defined by @xmath15 and used as a measure of sample quality . )",
    "the four samples were prepared as follows : + they were rolled down to a thickness appropriate for the pressure experiment(@xmath16 ) .",
    "initial rrr values of up to 300 were reduced to @xmath1750 by this operation .",
    "three of the samples ( # 46 ) were subsequently annealed in an induction furnace for 24 hours at 1000@xmath18 in a high vacuum ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "after annealing , rrrs in the range 245310 were recovered in samples from all sources , and grain sizes comparable to the eventual sample length were observed .",
    "sample ( # 3 ) was left unannealed .",
    "the samples were then cut using a razor blade to the appropriate width and length .",
    "they were arranged in the pressure cell , along with a lead manometer , so that current passed through in series .",
    "four - point resistance measurements could be carried out separately on each sample .",
    "a knowledge of the each sample s dimensions enabled the absolute resistivity to be calculated with an error of less than 15% over the whole pressure range , neglecting the compressibility .",
    "effect of disorder in different samples on the superconducting transition of iron .",
    "the dashed line suggests the @xmath20 variation vs. @xmath2 . ]    the effect of disorder on the superconducting state can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcrho0 ] , where the resistivity of three representative samples # 0 # 1 and # 3 are shown at pressures close to the maximum @xmath21 ; their residual resistivities were 2.13 , 0.77 , and 1.19 @xmath22 respectively . with increasing disorder , measured by @xmath2 ,",
    "the resistive transition becomes only partially complete , then disappears entirely .",
    "the remaining samples had resistance drops somewhere between # 1 and # 3 . a transition in # 3 ,",
    "the unannealed sample , was only detectable once the pressure had reached 22@xmath23gpa , while the annealed samples started to show signs of superconductivity almost as soon as the structural transition had initiated ( as identified in the room - temperature resistivity ) . rolling and annealing thus have opposite effects , tending to suppress or restore the superconductivity , with associated @xmath2 variation .",
    "the metallurgical state , rather than the chemical impurity level appears to be the dominant factor .",
    "sample # 1 , however , exhibited the highest @xmath20 ( @xmath24k ) .",
    "it was not annealed or rolled , but cut to shape with a diamond saw , implying that the annealing process may introduce some contamination which can affect @xmath25 .",
    "these results suggest that if @xmath2 can be lowered further , @xmath20 values larger than 2.5@xmath23k could be obtained .",
    "the resistivity of @xmath0-fe on a @xmath10 scale at selected pressures .",
    "inset : in a magnetic field @xmath26 = 1 t , the @xmath10 dependence persists below @xmath20 . ]    figure [ fig : rhot53 ] shows the relation @xmath27 in sample # 6 at several pressures , extending up to nearly 35@xmath28 , with the upward deviation at higher temperature ascribed to electron - phonon scattering . similar temperature dependence was seen in the other samples . if the exponent was allowed to vary , a fit of @xmath29 gave @xmath30 between 1.66 and 1.75 over the entire superconducting pressure range .",
    "there is an evident change with pressure of the residual resistivity @xmath2 , along with the temperature coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhot53 ] shows that the @xmath10 law remains valid down to very low temperature when the superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field of 1@xmath23 t .",
    "the normal - state resistance varied with magnetic field @xmath26 as @xmath31 up to 8@xmath23 t at 4.2@xmath23k and 700@xmath23mk .",
    "resistivity signature of the @xmath14-@xmath0 transition of iron with increasing pressure at 4.18 k and 293 k. ]    figure [ fig : behr_gf ] shows the resistivity at room temperature and 4.2@xmath23k in a superconducting ( # 6 ) and a non - superconducting sample ( # 0 ) as the pressure is increased .",
    "the @xmath14-@xmath0 transition is clearly visible at both temperatures , with a substantial increase in @xmath32 .",
    "however , the martensitic @xmath14-@xmath0 transition should start at @xmath33gpa in a steatite medium according to mssbauer effect experiments @xcite .",
    "the kink observed in @xmath32 at higher pressures , around 12@xmath23gpa , with no precursor signs is therefore unexpected .",
    "it could nevertheless be attributed to the disconnection of the conducting @xmath14 region by the growing amount of @xmath0 phase .    after a rounded maximum",
    ", the resistance at both temperatures drops quickly and more or less linearly with pressure , and in both cases can be extrapolated to the @xmath14-fe values at pressures close to the disappearance of superconductivity .",
    "the origin of the pressure - induced change in resistivity at room temperature might be due to a change in the electron - phonon coupling , or more likely to the large increase in spin disorder when passing from the magnetically ordered @xmath14-state to the @xmath0 phase .",
    "the effect of magnetic ordering on the resistivity has been explored in metastable non - magnetic @xmath34-fe at ambient pressure @xcite , where a large difference is found in the room - temperature resistivity between the magnetically ordered and non - magnetic states .",
    "we might therefore expect @xmath0-fe to be analogous .    at low temperature , where the phonon contribution is negligible ,",
    "the increase in @xmath32 is associated with additional disorder , but the very similar pressure dependence of @xmath32 at these two temperatures suggests that the scattering is at least in part of the same magnetic origin .",
    "the two samples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : behr_gf ] behave similarly at room temperature , apart from a shift ascribed to the residual term . at 4.2@xmath23k ,",
    "interestingly , the increase in resistivity associated with the @xmath35 transition is smaller for a lower @xmath2 .",
    "single crystalline iron whiskers , which can be prepared with rrrs around 1000 @xcite , therefore offer a good path to obtaining a higher @xmath20 .",
    "pressure dependence of ( a ) the superconducting transition of various fe samples and ( b ) the @xmath3 coefficient in the law @xmath27 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : tcanda ] shows @xmath20 as a function of pressure , compared with the @xmath3 coefficient of a fit to the resistivity using a @xmath36 power law in the @xmath14 phase and a @xmath10 law in the @xmath0 phase .",
    "the @xmath21 phase diagram in ref .",
    "@xcite is confirmed by our measurements .",
    "the superconductivity started to emerge exactly at the kink in @xmath37 .",
    "as the resistive transitions were highly current dependent and partial in most cases , the onset was used as a criteria for @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath20 was defined where the resistivity curve started to deviate visibly from the normal state temperature dependence .",
    "surprisingly , the onset of superconductivity was found to be much less sensitive to current than other criteria , such as a 50% , or even 1% drop in resistance from the normal state .",
    "the resistivity drop became larger in every sample as the pressure increased , even beyond the maximum in @xmath20 .",
    "the very large value of @xmath3 in the sc domain [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tcanda](b ) ] is evidence of a strongly correlated electronic phase .",
    "the value of @xmath3 reflects the strength of interaction between the electrons and spin fluctuations , thus the correlation seen between @xmath38 and @xmath21 is strong evidence for a magnetically mediated pairing scenario .",
    "moreover , there appears to be a positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath25 in different samples ( including those not shown ) .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the value of @xmath3 would vary between samples , but as they were all measured in the same cell , and their resistivities normalised at ambient pressure , we can have some confidence that this is a genuine observation .",
    "spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity is usually associated with a well defined quantum critical point at a particular critical pressure @xmath39 , where non - fermi liquid behavior of the resistivity is expected @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath36 dependence was never recovered in the entire sc domain in our measurements .    the critical field of @xmath0-fe at selected pressures .",
    "two @xmath20 criteria are used at 18.6 gpa . ]",
    "figure [ fig : hc2 ] shows the upper critical field @xmath40 for sample # 6 determined using an onset criterion for @xmath25 .",
    "the extrapolated value of @xmath41 ( 0.73@xmath23 t at 18.6@xmath23gpa and @xmath42 t at 22.5@xmath23gpa ) is much larger(by a factor of up to 70 ) than that of the lead manometer , which has a nearly identical @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath40 is also linear , without the usual curvature , at least down to @xmath43 .",
    "interpretation of this is difficult , because the internal magnetic field in the sample itself may be higher still .",
    "hints that this is the case come from the current dependence of the resistance within the transition .",
    "this could be fitted very well to a flux - flow type linear current - voltage relation , accompanied by a small quadratic term , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath6 , and @xmath45 was very small ( an equivalent current density of 0.17  @xmath46 ) , indicating an extremely low pinning density .",
    "this flux - flow like behaviour was present even with no externally applied magnetic field .    taking a value of 0.73@xmath23 t for @xmath41 ,",
    "the coherence length @xmath47 is around 20@xmath23 nm , which is comparable to the mean free path @xmath48 , derived from band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "a requirement for the clean limit , i.e. @xmath49 , is another feature of unconventional superconductivity .    the initial slope @xmath50 , which is proportional to the electronic effective mass in a clean limit scenario , appears to be larger for a @xmath12 below the @xmath20 maximum , suggesting a critical region close to the emergence of superconductivity . in any case , @xmath51 reaches values larger than that observed in any other sc element in the periodic table .",
    "in a narrow pressure window , both the superconductivity and normal phase of iron show features which point to a key role for spin fluctuations . the closest similar example seems to be zrzn@xmath13 ( @xmath52k ) @xcite .",
    "the higher @xmath25 of iron may result from stronger magnetic interactions , reflected for example in the large curie temperature of iron s ferromagnetic phase .",
    "experimentally , it is not clear whether superconductivity is an intrinsic property of @xmath0-fe or is related to the martensitic transition .",
    "iron is the first simple element to be observed exhibiting non - fermi liquid behaviour in its resistivity , and to be a candidate for spin - mediated superconductivity .",
