    "we consider the linearized sloshing problem in axisymmetric containers for a perfect fluid .",
    "the aim of the paper is to numerically study the positions of the _ high spots _ , the extremal points of the fundamental sloshing mode @xmath0 .",
    "their locations coincide with the extrema of the free surface elevation of liquid ( see ) , under the assumption that the liquid oscillates freely with a fundamental frequency according to @xmath0 .",
    "we work with a simplified linear model ( see ) , studied by many authors , including faltinsen - timokha @xcite , fox - kuttler @xcite , kozlov - kuznetsov @xcite and mciver @xcite .",
    "linear sloshing in simple moving containers was also considered by wu - chen @xcite , ardakani - bridges @xcite and herczyski - weidmann @xcite .",
    "more accurate physical models can also be considered , but nonlinear phenomena force a severly restricted choice of containers ( see a review of the numerical methods by rebouillat and liksonov @xcite ) . for",
    "general overview of both linear and nonlinear models of sloshing see monographs by ibrahim @xcite , kopachevsky - krein @xcite , lamb @xcite , moiseev @xcite or troesch @xcite .    in a bulbous container high spots",
    "are located inside the container ( see ) . on the other hand in a convex container , such that the angle between a wall of the container and a free surface is smaller or equal to @xmath1",
    ", high spots are located on the boundary of the container ( see ) .",
    "this effect was proved rigorously by kulczycki and kwanicki in @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied for spherical tanks by faltinsen and timokha @xcite , using analytic approximations .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new numerical scheme for calculating sloshing modes for solids of revolution .",
    "this scheme , applied to the fundamental mode , allows us to find positions of high spots with great accuracy .",
    "the same scheme can also be used to study higher sloshing modes . in",
    "we present numerical results for the first few modes of various containers , we inspect convergence of the numerical scheme and compare to known results .",
    "we also describe an ingenious method of obtaining images of oscillating liquid showing positions of high spots .",
    "our method is based on photographing a reflection of a dotted piece of paper on a very slightly disturbed surface of the liquid ( see ) .",
    "we experimented with 3 different containers and positions of the high spots agree with our numerical results and/or known results .",
    "our experiment was first briefly described in the steklov memoirs published in notices of ams @xcite .",
    "finally , in we describe the relation of the high spot problem to the celebrated hot spots conjecture .",
    "we assume that the inviscid , incompressible , heavy liquid occupies a three - dimensional container bounded from above by a free surface , which in its mean position is a simply connected two - dimensional domain of finite diameter .",
    "let cartesian coordinates @xmath2 be chosen so that the mean free surface lies in the @xmath3-plane and the @xmath4-axis is directed upwards ( see ) .",
    "the surface tension is neglected on the free surface , and we assume the liquid motion to be irrotational and of small amplitude .",
    "these assumptions allow us to linearise the boundary conditions on the free surface and get the following boundary value problem for @xmath5 ( the velocity potential of the flow with a time - harmonic factor removed ) :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the part of the container filled with liquid ( in its mean position ) , @xmath8 is the wetted part of its boundary , and @xmath9 is the free surface of the liquid ( see ) .",
    "the outer normal derivative on @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the zero eigenvalue obviously exists for the problem ( [ slosh1][slosh3 ] ) , but we exclude it with the help of the following orthogonality condition : @xmath11 this condition also ensures that the volume of the fluid is preserved throughout the sloshing process .",
    "let us reiterate that we are working with a linear model .",
    "we are not concerned with the interactions between the fluid and the environment . as such",
    ", the model is well suited for infinitesimal sloshing of a perfect liquid ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "our approximations only apply to a nearly still water surface , as opposed to turbulent phenomena in strong sloshing ( as in @xcite ) .    for sufficiently regular domains",
    "it is known that the mixed steklov problem  ( [ slosh1][slosh4 ] ) has a discrete sequence of eigenvalues @xmath12 and the corresponding modes @xmath13 , @xmath14 , restricted to the free surface @xmath9 , form ( together with a constant function elliminated by ) a complete orthogonal set in @xmath15 .",
    "the following observation plays a key role in our study : if the liquid oscillates freely with the fundamental frequency @xmath16 then at every moment the free - surface elevation of the liquid is proportional to the fundamental eigenfunction @xmath17 ( see e.g. lamb @xcite ) .    let us point out , that general containers are very hard to work with , even with the linearized model .",
    "axisymmetric domains described below encompass many practical shapes and are somewhat easier to handle .",
    "another simplification leading to manageable calculations involves two - dimensional containers , or long troughs with fluid sloshing only sideways .",
    "these were studied by kulczycki - kuznetsov @xcite and faltinsen - timokha @xcite , among others .",
    "now we turn to the problem of sloshing in axisymmetric containers .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the cylindrical coordinates @xmath18 so that @xmath19 and to take the @xmath4-axis as the axis of symmetry for @xmath7 . in this case",
    "@xmath9 is typically a disc on @xmath20-plane ( ) .",
    "moreover , we will consider @xmath7 as being obtained from the rotation of a domain @xmath21 adjacent to both axes in the @xmath22-plane ( ) .",
    "it is convenient to think of @xmath21 as the cross - sections of @xmath7 along the half - plane @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that the ansatz @xmath24 where @xmath25 is bounded near @xmath26 , reduces the eigenvalue problem ( [ slosh1][slosh3 ] ) in @xmath7 to the following sequence of boundary value problems : @xmath27 these relations must hold for all @xmath28 , and by  , for @xmath29 we also need @xmath30    the above reduction was applied by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that there is no boundary condition on @xmath31 , but if @xmath32 we need continuity of the three dimensional solution , while for @xmath33 we need continuous derivative ( three dimensional solutions are harmonic , hence smooth ) .",
    "therefore we have either dirichlet ( @xmath32 ) or neumann ( @xmath33 ) condition implied on @xmath31 .",
    "the variational methods ( e.g. @xcite ) guarantee that for every @xmath34 , the spectral problem ( [ sloshd1][sloshd4 ] ) has a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath35 and corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "every eigenvalue in ( [ meigenvalues ] ) has a finite multiplicity .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath39 we have @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that , the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath42 of problem ( [ slosh1])([slosh4 ] ) for @xmath7 coincides with the double sequence @xmath43 , with every number @xmath44 repeated twice when @xmath45 .",
    "thus the sequence of problems ( [ sloshd1])([sloshd4 ] ) is equivalent to the original sloshing problem .",
    "usually , the modes corresponding to @xmath16 are antisymmetric ( that is @xmath46 ) .",
    "nevertheless , some rather strange containers ( profiles from and ) have rotationally symmetric fundamental eigenfunctions . for the latter",
    "we show numerically that @xmath47 , and @xmath48 instead .    under the assumption @xmath46 , there are two linearly independent antisymmetric fundamental sloshing modes corresponding to the least eigenvalue @xmath16 ( @xmath49 , has double multiplicity ) . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "they have the form with @xmath50 .    by  (",
    "* theorems  1.1 and 1.2 ) , if @xmath7 is a convex solid of revolution such that the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is smaller or equal to @xmath1 , then indeed @xmath51 correspond to antisymmetric eigenfunctions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the high spots of the modes described by @xmath52 and @xmath53 are located on the boundary , e.g. containers from and . on the other hand , ( *",
    "* proposition  1.3 ) ( see also @xcite ) asserts that if @xmath8 and @xmath9 form an obtuse angle then @xmath54 , @xmath55 attain their maxima inside @xmath9 , as shown on .",
    "we check our numerical methods described below against these theoretical results in .",
    "in this section we design a two dimensional numerical finite element scheme ( fem ) for calculating the sloshing eigenvalues ( and eigenfunctions ) of the solids of revolution described in .",
    "three dimensional fem can also be used ( see e.g. @xcite ) , however one should be able to improve accuracy by exploiting decomposition ( see also ) .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to a singular weak formulation , due to the singular form of the gradient in polar coordinates . we introduce two modifications , leading to nonsingular schemes .",
    "the first is more natural , but leads to badly conditioned discrete problems for higher modes @xmath28 , due to fast decaying weights near @xmath56 .",
    "the second modification is designed to keep a balance between singularity removal and decay of the weights .",
    "we use the second approach to recover , essentially exactly , the results for partially filled tanks obtained by mciver @xcite , for modes @xmath57 .",
    "the same approach can be applied to arbitrary axisymmetric containers .",
    "our derivations are based on the classical weak formulations of eigenvalue problems ( see e.g. babuka - osborn @xcite and blanchard - brning @xcite ) .",
    "one can also consult bernardi , dauge and maday @xcite for axisymmetric domains .",
    "we introduce the first modified , but equivalent decomposition by putting @xmath58 .",
    "the solutions of the original three dimensional problem take the form ( cf . )",
    "@xmath59 note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are polar forms of the harmonic polynomials , e.g. @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . indeed ,",
    "if we interpret @xmath65 as a complex number @xmath66 , then @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath69 is analytic inside @xmath7 ( it is in fact harmonic ) .",
    "in particular , the first @xmath28 @xmath70-derivatives must be continuous , forcing @xmath69 to decay at least as fast as @xmath71 , hence our modified decomposition can be used to solve the sloshing problem .",
    "we will show that this new decomposition leads to a nonsingular weak formulation .",
    "note that the neumann boundary condition on @xmath8 must be imposed on @xmath72 .",
    "this is however irrelevant , since neumann boundary conditions are naturally incorporated into weak formulations .",
    "troesch @xcite used a similar approach ( family of harmonic polynomials , solid spherical harmonics ) to find the shape of the domain on which a polynomial is one of the eigenfunctions for the sloshing problem .",
    "he found that the lowest @xmath50 mode for a cone with aperture angle @xmath1 has eigenfunction with @xmath73 .",
    "our modification gives @xmath74 , and even the simplest linear numerical approximation provides the exact solution .",
    "in fact for any @xmath32 , troesch found a cone such that @xmath75 is the lowest mode .",
    "the above approach gives the best possible accuracy near @xmath56 , effectively removing the decay at @xmath56 from all eigenfunctions .",
    "however , in order to remove the singularity of the angular derivative , it is enough to introduce @xmath76 for @xmath32 .",
    "this means that low degree approximations ( linear or quadratic ) can not recover the exact decay around @xmath56 for @xmath28 larger than @xmath77 .",
    "however , this limitation does not influence overall performance of the numerical method , especially that the high spots for the fundamental mode occur close to the boundary ( far from @xmath56 ) .",
    "all the numerical results described in were obtained using this approach .",
    "we will derive appropriate weak formulations based on weighted sobolev spaces described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath78 the former is the classical weighted sobolve space , while latter is more appropriate for @xmath32 , as we show below .    start with the differential equation written in a divergence form @xmath79    first we find the weak formulation for the classical decomposition ( [ rep ] ) and the steklov problem ( [ sloshd1][sloshd4 ] ) .",
    "we want to construct a symmetric bilinear form using the @xmath80 inner product of @xmath81 and smooth test functions .",
    "then we can formally close the form in appropriate sobolev space to get a valid weak formulation . for smooth functions ,",
    "the equation @xmath82 is equivalent to @xmath83 v\\,drdz=-\\int_d \\nabla \\psi\\cdot \\nabla v\\,rdrdz+\\int_{\\partial d } r \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n}v\\,ds\\nonumber    \\\\&=-\\int_d r\\nabla \\psi\\cdot \\nabla v\\,drdz+\\int_f \\lambda_m \\psi v\\,rdr.\\label{weak1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last equality used the fact that the boundary integral equals @xmath84 on @xmath8 ( due to neumann bc for @xmath25 ) and on @xmath31 ( since @xmath56 ) .",
    "note that we did not need to know the boundary condition for @xmath31 , as long as @xmath25 is bounded there .",
    "note that the above weak formulation is consistent with the reduction of the integral @xmath85 from the three dimensional axisymmetric container to its two dimensional profile .",
    "in particular we get @xmath86 , the polar jacobian .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider the reduced problem on @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath33 ( axisymmetric eigenfunctions ) , formulation reduces to @xmath88 the left side naturally extends to @xmath87 , and the space of all axisymmetric functions @xmath89 ( on the 3d container @xmath7 ) is isomorphic to @xmath87 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii ) .",
    "furthermore , traces of such functions on @xmath9 are well defined , and belong to @xmath90 .",
    "we get a compact embedding of @xmath87 into @xmath91 and the standard spectral argument ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3 ) ) leads to discreteness of the spectrum of the quadratic form .",
    "when @xmath32 , the weak formulation contains singular @xmath92 inner product .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider the space @xmath93 as its domain .",
    "functions in this space have null trace on @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) , and the space is isomorphic to @xmath89 with zero condition on the axis of symmetry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii ) .",
    "this last condition exactly characterizes the sloshing modes @xmath32 .",
    "however , the presence of the singular @xmath92 norm hinders applicability of that weak formulation .",
    "the first modified decomposition solves this issue , by introducing @xmath94 , effectively eliminating the singularity .",
    "replacing @xmath25 with @xmath95 and the test function @xmath96 with @xmath97 ( to keep symmetry of the formulation ) leads to    @xmath98    the last expression defines a symmetric quadratic form that can be extended to the sobolev space @xmath99 .",
    "again , one gets appropriate compact embeddings into @xmath100 , and @xmath101 can be used to numerically approximate the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions for @xmath32 .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of @xmath102 in the weak formulation requires high degree quadratures for accurate numerical integration near @xmath56 when @xmath28 is large .",
    "furthermore , fast decay of @xmath102 leads to discrete matrix eigenvalue problems with nearly singular matrices , for very fine meshes .",
    "this degrades the convergence of the numerical method , or even leads to numerically singular matrices .",
    "these problems are mitigated by a linear approach @xmath103 ( described in ) .",
    "we get @xmath104 note that when @xmath50 we recover the first modification , while for @xmath105 we still use the sobolev space @xmath106 , hence avoiding high powers of @xmath70 , high degree quadratures in numerical integration , and nearly singular matrices in the discrete approximation .      the simplified weak formulations and allow us to use commonly available numerical method suitable for laplace eigenvalue problems",
    ". however , we only present the latter approach due to numerical instability of we experienced for @xmath105 . note that formulations and are the same for @xmath50 , usually containing the fundamental mode .",
    "we triangulate the domain and use conforming @xmath107 ( first - order ) or @xmath108 ( second - order ) finite elements to discretize the weak formulation .",
    "resulting piecewise linear ( or quadratic ) functions give approximate shapes of the eigenfunctions , in particular the sloshing profiles on @xmath9 , showing high - spots .",
    "we also design an adaptive mesh refining strategy to decrease errors in approximations , and fit the possibly curved boundary .",
    "we use classical local residual error a posteriori estimators ( see e.g. ainsworth and oden @xcite ) , that were recently studied for pure steklov problems by armentano - padra @xcite , garau - morin @xcite .",
    "we modify their approach to fit the weighted weak formulation and variable boundary conditions . in each step",
    "we choose a small fraction of triangles to be refined , based on the largest local error estimators ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definitions 2.5 and 2.7 ) ) .",
    "even though we are using to find approximation @xmath109 , we evaluate the error estimators on @xmath110 and the original operator @xmath111 given by .",
    "more precisely , for any triangle @xmath112 and its edge @xmath113 in the triangulation of the domain we find @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the inner , and @xmath116 is the outer normal derivative for the edge @xmath113 . note that @xmath116 is evaluated outside of @xmath112 , on an adjacent piece of the triangulation .",
    "the element residual measures deviation of the approximation from harmonicity .",
    "the jump residual is responsible for the discontinuity of the derivative of the approximation across triangles . finally , the boundary residual measures deviation from the steklov eigenvalue condition on @xmath9 .",
    "we add all errors corresponding to the same triangle and refine the least accurate @xmath117 of the triangles . finally , we add all errors and take square root to find a global residual norm , used in the numerical results to control convergence .",
    "it turns out that this norm correlates almost exactly with the eigenvalue error in known cases . in cases where the eigenvalues are not known ,",
    "the plots of the squared norm and the differences to the best approximation are also nearly identical .",
    "this indicates that we have a reliable error estimator .    in order to get more than just the first eigenvalue , we considered the following strategies .",
    "execute the adaptive loop just for the first eigenvalue and find all eigenvalues based on fully refined mesh .",
    "this leads to rather poor approximations for higher eigenvalues .",
    "it is better to add residual errors from all eigenfunctions and refine worst triangles based on the accumulated estimators .",
    "this gives much better results for higher eigenvalues , but slightly degrades the accuracy of the lowest eigenvalue estimation .",
    "finally , we tried to run the adaptive algorithm for each eigenvalue separately .",
    "this is obviously optimal , but one must first know fair approximations for these eigenvalues in order to target the specific one . in practice ,",
    "the optimal separate calculations must be preceded by a collective adaptive calculation yielding good starting points for targeted searches .",
    "we used fenics @xcite to implement the above numerical scheme .",
    "it provides intuitive mathematical interface for defining weak forms and solving differential equations using finite element methods .",
    "adaptive methods are also easy to implement , including residual errors and snapping mesh boundary to a given theoretical domain .      assuming that variable @xmath118 contains an already created triangulation , we define appropriate function space ( quadratic continuous - galerkin method ) , test and trial functions    .... v = functionspace(mesh , \" cg \" , 2 ) # second order method u = trialfunction(v ) v = testfunction(v ) ....    we do not need to specify any boundary conditions , but we need to create subdomain @xmath9 , since we integrate over it later .",
    "we assume that @xmath119 and the mesh is contained in @xmath120 .",
    "we can use variable @xmath121 to limit @xmath9 to @xmath122 .",

    "in this section we apply our numerical scheme to various shapes , including spherical and cylindrical tanks . we chose to limit the calculations to around 100 000 triangles with the quadratic method , and 400 000 triangles with the linear method ( about 0.5 gb memory usage for both methods ) .",
    "we recover the exact solutions for cylindrical tanks with great accuracy .",
    "we also get nearly the same results as mciver @xcite in the numerically challenging spherical case ( curved boundary ) .",
    "finally we study quite general domains end use residual norms to check stability and convergence of our approximations .",
    ".numerical approximations of the three smallest eigenvalues for modes @xmath144 , for a cylinder with radius @xmath145 and height @xmath145 compared to true eigenvalues , using either linear @xmath107 ( 400k triangles ) or quadratic @xmath108 elements ( 100k triangles ) . finally we use a collective adaptive loop , or each eigenvalue separately . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "traditionally , laplace eigenvalues are intuitively understood via heat flow .",
    "the dirichlet eigenvalues of a domain @xmath9 govern the heat on a plate @xmath9 with zero temperature on the boundary , while the neumann eigenvalues are related to the insulated plate .",
    "this explains the name `` hot spots conjecture '' , for one the famous open problems ( discussed below ) .",
    "the famous paper `` can one hear the shape of drum ? '' by kac @xcite emphasizes another practical interpretation for dirichlet spectrum .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions give the shapes of the drum membrane vibrating in one of the characteristic frequencies .",
    "the neumann spectrum is harder to explain this way , as one would need a membrane that is free to float up and down while vibrating , but is horizontal near the boundary .",
    "this behavior can however be attributed to the free surface of an ideal liquid in a container .",
    "therefore , sloshing not only generalizes the neumann spectral problem , but also provides a clear physical intuition .",
    "in particular the hot spots problem ( see below ) might as well be called the high spot problem for a container with vertical walls .",
    "roughly speaking , the hot spots conjecture states that in a thermally insulated domain , for `` typical '' initial conditions , the hottest point will move towards the boundary of the domain , as time passes .",
    "the mathematical formulation of the hot spots conjecture is the following : the extrema of every fundamental eigenfunction ( eigenvalue may have multiplicity ) of the neumann problem for a domain @xmath9 are located on the boundary of @xmath9 . the conjecture was proved for certain sufficiently symmetric planar domains by bauelos - burdzy @xcite and jerison - nadirashvili @xcite , but disproved for some strange domains with holes by burdzy and werner @xcite , and just one hole by burdzy @xcite .",
    "see _ nature _ article by stewart  @xcite for more information , and terence tao s polymath project  @xcite for current developments .",
    "this problem can be embedded in the studied sloshing problem as follows :    function @xmath146 is a sloshing mode in the cylinder @xmath147 if and only if @xmath148 is a neumann eigenfunction on @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore @xmath149 and @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the neumann eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath152 is the sloshing eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath146 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.1 ) . due to the very explicit connection between these problems ,",
    "many results and conjectures for neumann spectrum can be quickly translated to the sloshing language . in particular",
    ", the high spots problem  ( [ slosh1][slosh4 ] ) generalizes the hot spots conjecture .    by the above identification and the results of  @xcite , for any convex domain @xmath9 with two orthogonal axes of symmetry ( e.g. ellipses ) ,",
    "the high spots of the fundamental sloshing modes for cylindrical tanks with cross - section @xmath9 are located on the boundary .",
    "note that the counterexample for the hot spots conjecture given by burdzy and werner @xcite is conceptually rather similar to the shape from or .",
    "indeed , their domain consists of a disk and a larger annulus , connected using spokes . the profile from shows two deep containers with a disk and an annulus as free surfaces , connected using extremely shallow portion . in both cases one would like to have two disjoint subdomains , but",
    "a minimal connection must be made . in the high spot problem",
    "there are more ways to make the domain connected due to one extra dimension .",
    "for that reason it is much easier to construct intuitive counterexamples for high spots problem .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the high spot conjecture to hold for convex containers .",
    "the connection between neumann problem and sloshing was also used to conjecture bounds for the eigenvalues . in particular the dirichlet to neumann eigenvalue comparisons @xcite was already extended to mixed steklov eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bounds for spectral functionals for neumann eigenvalues naturally extend to the cylindrical sloshing case ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 13 ) ) , opening a whole new area of research for general containers . finally , sloshing problem can be used to tackle , seemingly unrelated , spectral problems for nonlocal fractional laplacian @xcite .",
