    "soon after the discovery of recoil - free emission and absorption of gamma rays by mssbauer  in 1958  @xcite , it has been suggested by visscher that a similar effect should also exist for neutrinos emitted in electron capture processes from unstable nuclei embedded into a crystal lattice  @xcite . in the 1980 s ,",
    "the idea was further developed by kells and schiffer  @xcite , who showed that bound state beta decay  @xcite could provide an alternative recoilless production mechanism . in this case ,",
    "an antineutrino with a very small energy uncertainty would be emitted , which could then be absorbed through induced orbital electron capture  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in this idea , inspired by two works by raghavan  @xcite , in which the feasibility of an experiment using the emission process @xmath1 and the detection process @xmath2 has been studied .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 atoms were proposed to be embedded into metal crystals .",
    "the detection process would then have a resonance nature , leading to an enhancement of the detection cross section by up to a factor of @xmath5 compared to the non - resonance capture of neutrinos of the same energy .",
    "if such an experiment were realized , it could carry out a very interesting physics program , including neutrino detection with 100 g scale ( rather than ton or kiloton scale ) detectors , searching for neutrino oscillations driven by the mixing angle @xmath6 at a baseline of only 10  m , determining the neutrino mass hierarchy without using matter effects , searching for active - sterile neutrino oscillations and studying the gravitational redshift of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider recoillessly emitted and captured neutrinos ",
    "which we will call mssbauer  neutrinos  from a theoretical point of view . in our discussion , we will mainly focus on the @xmath3@xmath4 system of eqs .   and , but most of our results apply also to other emitters and absorbers of mssbauer  neutrinos .    one of our main goals is to resolve the recent controversy about the question of whether mssbauer  neutrinos would oscillate .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the answer to this question depends on whether equal energies or equal momenta are assumed for different neutrino mass eigenstates ",
    "the assumptions often made in deriving the standard formula for the oscillation probability .",
    "moreover , a possible inhibition of oscillations due to the time - energy uncertainty relation has been brought up  @xcite . to come to definitive conclusions regarding the oscillation phenomenology of mssbauer  neutrinos",
    ", we employ a quantum field theoretical ( qft ) approach , in which neutrinos are treated as intermediate states in the combined process and no _ a priori _ assumptions on the energies or momenta of the different neutrino mass eigenstates are made .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : qualitative ] by qualitatively discussing how the peculiar features of mssbauer  neutrinos , and in particular their very small energy uncertainty , affect the oscillation phenomenology .",
    "we argue that oscillations do occur , and that the coherence length is infinite if line broadening is neglected .",
    "we then proceed to quantitative arguments in sec .",
    "[ sec : qm ] and discuss a formula for the @xmath0 survival probability in the quantum mechanical intermediate wave packet formalism  @xcite , in which the neutrino is described as a superposition of three wave packets , one for each mass eigenstate . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qft ] , we derive our main result , the rate for the combined process of neutrino production , propagation and detection in the qft external wave packet approach . in this framework ,",
    "the neutrino is described by an internal line in a feynman diagram , while its production and detection partners are described by wave packets . also in this section , for the first time",
    ", we calculate the rates for beta decay with production of a bound - state electron and for the inverse process of stimulated electron capture in the case of nuclei bound to a crystal lattice .",
    "we distinguish between different neutrino line broadening mechanisms and concentrate on the oscillation phenomenology , paying special attention to the coherence and localization terms in the @xmath0 survival probability and to the mssbauer  resonance conditions arising in each case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the obtained results and draw our conclusions .",
    "mssbauer  neutrinos have very special properties compared to those of neutrinos emitted and detected in conventional processes . in particular , they are almost monochromatic because they are produced in two - body decays of nuclei embedded in a crystal lattice and no phonon excitations of the host crystal accompany their production , which ensures the recoilless nature of this process .",
    "therefore the width of the neutrino line is only limited by the natural linewidth , which is the reciprocal of the mean lifetime of the emitter , and by solid - state effects , including electromagnetic interactions of the randomly oriented nuclear spins , lattice defects and impurities  @xcite . for @xmath3 decay ,",
    "the natural linewidth is @xmath7  ev , but it has been estimated that various broadening effects degrade this value to an experimentally achievable mssbauer  linewidth of @xmath8  @xcite . compared to the neutrino energy in bound state @xmath3 decay , @xmath9  kev , the achievable relative linewidth is therefore of order @xmath10 .    in the standard derivations of the neutrino oscillation formula",
    "it is often assumed that the different neutrino mass eigenstates composing the produced flavor eigenstate have the same momentum ( @xmath11 ) , while their kinetic energies differ by @xmath12 . for bound state tritium beta decay ( [ eq : prod ] ) and @xmath13 ev@xmath14 one has @xmath15 ev , which is much larger than @xmath16 .",
    "one may therefore wonder if the extremely small energy uncertainty of mssbauer  neutrinos would inhibit oscillations by destroying the coherence of the different mass eigenstates of which the produced @xmath0 is composed .",
    "indeed , if neutrinos are emitted with no momentum uncertainty and their energy uncertainty ( @xmath17 ) is much smaller than the energy differences of the different mass eigenstates , in each decay event one would exactly know which mass eigenstate has been emitted .",
    "this would prevent a coherent emission of different mass eigenstates , thus destroying neutrino oscillations .",
    "if , on the contrary , one adopts the same energy assumption , the momenta of different mass eigenstates would differ by @xmath18 , which would not destroy their coherence provided that the momentum uncertainty of the emitted neutrino state is greater that @xmath19 ; in that case , oscillations are possible .",
    "it is well known that in reality neither same momentum nor same energy assumptions are correct @xcite ; however , for neutrinos from conventional sources both lead to the correct result , the reason being that neutrinos are ultra - relativistic and the spatial size of the corresponding wave packets is small compared to the oscillation length .",
    "the above assumptions are thus just shortcuts which allow one to arrive at the correct result in an easy ( though not rigorous ) way .",
    "however , mssbauer   neutrinos represent a very peculiar case , which requires a special consideration .",
    "let us discuss the issue of coherence of different mass eigenstates in more detail .",
    "if one knows the values of the neutrino energy @xmath20 and momentum @xmath21 with uncertainties @xmath22 and @xmath23 , from the energy - momentum relation of relativistic particles @xmath24 one can infer the value of the squared neutrino mass @xmath25 with the uncertainty @xmath26 where it is assumed that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are independent .",
    "by @xmath22 and @xmath23 we will now understand the intrinsic quantum mechanical uncertainties of the neutrino energy and momentum , beyond which these quantities can not be measured in a given production or detection process ; @xmath27 is then the quantum mechanical uncertainty of the inferred neutrino squared mass .",
    "a generic requirement for coherent emission of different mass eigenstates is their indistinguishability : the uncertainty @xmath27 has to be larger than the mass squared difference @xmath28  @xcite . from the above discussion , we know that for mssbauer   neutrinos corresponding to the @xmath3@xmath4 system one has",
    "@xmath29  ev@xmath14 , which is much smaller than @xmath30 ev@xmath14 .",
    "thus , whether or not mssbauer  neutrinos oscillate depends on whether or not @xmath31 .",
    "while the energy of mssbauer  neutrinos is very precisely given by the production process itself , this is not the case for their momentum .",
    "the neutrino momentum can in principle be determined by measuring the recoil momentum of the crystal in which the emitter is embedded .",
    "the ultimate uncertainty @xmath23 of this measurement is related to the coordinate uncertainty @xmath32 of the emitting nucleus through the heisenberg relation @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , for the momentum uncertainty to be small enough to destroy the coherence of different mass eigenstates , @xmath34 , the coordinate uncertainty of the emitter must satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the emitter should be strongly de - localized with the coordinate uncertainty @xmath32 of order of the neutrino oscillation length @xmath36  m. this is certainly not the case , because the coordinate uncertainty of the emitter can not exceed the size of the source , i.e.  a few cm .",
    "in fact , it is even much smaller , because in principle it is possible to find out which particular nucleus has undergone the mssbauer  transition by destroying the crystal and checking which @xmath37h atom has been transformed into @xmath37he .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is of the order of interatomic distances , i.e.  @xmath38 kev , so that @xmath39 this means that mssbauer  neutrinos will oscillate .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : local ] ) is often called the localization condition , because it requires the neutrino source to be localized in a spatial region that is small compared to the neutrino oscillation length @xmath40 .    it should be noted that for the observability of neutrino oscillations the coherence of the emitted neutrino state is not by itself sufficient ; in addition , this state must not lose its coherence until the neutrino is detected .",
    "a coherence loss could occur because of the wave packet separation .",
    "when a neutrino is produced as a flavour eigenstate , the wave packets of its mass eigenstate components fully overlap ; however , since they propagate with different group velocities , after a time @xmath41 or upon propagating a distance @xmath42 , these wave packets separate to such an extent that they can no longer interfere in the detector , and oscillations become unobservable .",
    "the coherence length @xmath43 depends on the energy uncertainty @xmath22 of the emitted neutrino state and becomes infinite in the limit @xmath44 .    from the above discussion",
    "it follows that the oscillation phenomenology of mssbauer  neutrinos should mainly depend on their momentum uncertainty , whereas their energy uncertainty , though crucial for the mssbauer  resonance condition , plays a relatively minor role for neutrino oscillations .",
    "therefore , the equal energy assumption , though in general incorrect , should be a good approximation when discussing oscillations of mssbauer  neutrinos . adopting this approach ,",
    "i.e.  assuming the neutrino energy to be _ exactly _ fixed at a value @xmath20 by the production process , one obtains for the @xmath0 survival probability @xmath45 at a distance @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{eq : infinite - wp - p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 is the leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath49 are the partial oscillation lengths , @xmath50 and the neutrinos are assumed to be ultra - relativistic or nearly mass - degenerate , so that @xmath51 eq .  ( [ eq : infinite - wp - p1 ] ) is just the standard result for the @xmath0 survival probability . as expected , we do not obtain any decoherence factors if the neutrino energy is exactly fixed .",
    "we have also taken into account here that in real experiments the size of the source and detector are much smaller than the smallest of the oscillation lengths @xmath49 , so that the localization condition is satisfied .",
    "although eq .   shows that neutrino oscillations are not inhibited by the energy constraints implied by the mssbauer  effect , the assumption of an exactly fixed neutrino energy is certainly unrealistic . therefore , we will now proceed to a more accurate treatment of mssbauer  neutrinos using an intermediate wave packet model  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the propagating neutrino is described by a superposition of mass eigenstates , each of which is in turn a wave packet with a finite momentum width . with the assumption of gaussian wave packets , giunti , kim and lee",

    "\\label{eq : qm - p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath53 are the partial coherence lengths , @xmath23 being the effective momentum uncertainty of the neutrino state , and the oscillation lengths @xmath49 are given by eq .  .",
    "@xmath20 is the energy that a massless neutrino emitted in the same process would have , and the @xmath54 parameter @xmath55 quantifies the deviation of the actual energies of massive neutrinos from this value . since the energy uncertainty is very small for mssbauer  neutrinos ,",
    "the mass eigenstates differ in momentum , but hardly in energy , so that @xmath55 should be negligibly small in our case .",
    "one can see that the first term in the exponent of eq .",
    "is the standard oscillation phase .",
    "the second term yields a decoherence factor , which describes the suppression of oscillations due to the wave packet separation . for conventional neutrino experiments with non - negligible @xmath55 ,",
    "the third term implements a localization condition by suppressing oscillations if the spatial width @xmath56 of the neutrino wave packet is much larger than the oscillation length @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : losc ] ) and ( [ eq : local ] ) ) .",

    "we will now proceed to the discussion of a qft approach  @xcite , in which these quantities will be automatically determined from the properties of the source and the detector .",
    "our calculation will be based on the feynman diagram shown in fig .",

    "we take the external particles to be confined by quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator potentials to reflect the fact that they are bound in a crystal lattice .",
    "typical values for the harmonic oscillator frequencies are of the order of the debye temperature @xmath57 ev of the respective crystals  @xcite .",
    "although this simplistic treatment neglects the detailed structure of the solid state lattice , it is known to correctly reproduce the main features of the conventional mssbauer  effect  @xcite , and since we are interested mainly in the oscillation physics and not in the exact overall process rate , it is sufficient for our purposes . as only recoil - free neutrino emission and absorption are of interest to us , we can neglect thermal excitations and consider the parent and daughter nuclei in the source and detector to be in the ground states of their respective harmonic oscillator potentials .    in sec .",

    "well established approximations that are known to be good in the theory of the standard mssbauer  effect .    in all three approaches that have been discussed ,",
    "we have consistently arrived at the prediction that mssbauer  neutrinos will oscillate , in spite of their very small energy uncertainty .",
    "the plane wave result , eq .  , is actually the standard textbook expression for the @xmath0 survival probability , and eqs .  , and are extensions of this expression , containing , in particular , decoherence and localization factors .",
    "we have found that these factors can not suppress oscillations under realistic experimental conditions , but are very interesting from the theoretical point of view .",
    "let us now compare the results of different approaches .",
    "first , we observe that the decoherence exponents in our qft calculations are linear in @xmath294 , while in the quantum mechanical result , eq .  , the dependence is quadratic .",
    "this behaviour can be traced back to the fact that gaussian neutrino wave packets have been assumed in the quantum mechanical computation , while in our qft approach we have employed the lorentzian line shapes , which are more appropriate for describing mssbauerneutrinos .",
    "the linear dependence of the decoherence exponents on @xmath294 in the case of the lorentzian neutrino energy distribution has been previously pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "even more striking than the differing forms of the decoherence exponentials is the fact that a localization factor of the form @xmath295 $ ] is present in eqs .   and , while the localization exponentials disappear from eq .   in the limit @xmath296 which is relevant for mssbauer  neutrinos",
    "this shows that the naive quantum mechanical wave packet approach does not capture all features of mssbauer  neutrinos . in particular , it neglects the differences between the emission ( and absorption ) probabilities of different mass eigenstates , which effectively may lead to a suppression of neutrino mixing . in realistic experiments ,",
    "however , this effect should be negligible .",
    "another interesting feature of the exponential factors implementing the localization condition in our qft calculations is that the corresponding exponents are linear in @xmath297 , whereas the dependence is quadratic ( for @xmath298 in the quantum - mechanical expression .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that we consider the parent and daughter nuclei in the source and detector to be in bound states with zero mean momentum ( but non - zero _ rms _ momentum ) .",
    "this is also the reason why the @xmath23-dependence of the localization exponents in eqs .   and is different from that in the quantum mechanical approach ( namely , they depend on @xmath299 rather than @xmath300 ) : for the considered bound states , the _ rms _ momentum is @xmath301 , so that @xmath302 .",
    "one more point to notice is that while the same quantity , the momentum uncertainty , enters into the decoherence and localization factors in the quantum mechanical formula  , this is not the case in the qft approach , where the localization factors depend on @xmath23 , whereas the decoherence exponentials are determined by the ( much smaller ) energy uncertainty . in the case of natural line broadening this energy uncertainty is given by the @xmath37h decay width @xmath16 , while in all the other cases it is given by the widths of the neutrino emission and absorption lines , which are determined by the homogeneous and inhomogeneous line broadening effects taking place in the source and detector .",
    "the qft results of eqs .   and",
    "describe not only the oscillation physics , but also the production and detection processes .",
    "these results can thus also be used for an approximate prediction of the total event rate expected in a mssbauer  neutrino experiment .",
    "both expressions contain the lamb - mssbauer  factor ( or recoil - free fraction ) , which describes the relative probability of recoilless decay and absorption of neutrinos .",

    "broadening ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qft - inhom ] ) as well as for homogeneous broadening different from the natural linewidth effect , this is a lorentzian factor , the same as in the no - oscillation rate .",
    "it suppresses the transition rate if the peak energies of the emission and absorption lines differ by more than the combined linewidth @xmath303 .",
    "we have , however , found that the factorization of the total rate into the no - oscillation rate including the overlap factor and the oscillation probability is only approximate .",
    "for the hypothetical case of an experiment in which the neutrino energy uncertainty is dominated by the natural linewidth @xmath16 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qft - nat ] ) , we have found that the overlap condition does not depend on @xmath16 , but is rather determined by the reciprocal of the overall duration of the experiment @xmath161 .",
    "although this result may seem counterintuitive at first sight , it has a well - known analogy in quantum optics  @xcite and is related to the fact that the initial unstable particles in the source are produced in a time interval much shorter than their lifetime .",
    "notice that the overlap factors contained in our qft - based results for the neutrino mssbauer  effect governed by the natural linewidth and by other line broadening mechanisms , eqs .   and , are two well - known limiting representations of the @xmath131-function , which yield the energy - conserving @xmath131-function @xmath304 in the limits @xmath305 or @xmath306 , respectively . because it describes a probability rather than a rate",
