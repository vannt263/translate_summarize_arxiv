    "the direct imaging and characterization of earth - like planets , especially those capable of supporting life , is one of the outstanding goals of modern astrophysics and science in general . currently , high - angular resolution astronomical imaging can be achieved interferometrically by combining the wavefronts from spatially separated telescopes  @xcite . interferometric imaging and nulling require that the light from multiple apertures be combined .",
    "although beam combining can be performed using bulk optics , integrated optic ( io ) implementations offer a number of important advantages .",
    "these include spatial filtering , enhanced stability , on - chip fringe scanning , compactness and scalability .",
    "io beam combiners for astronomical imaging were first proposed by kern , malbet , schanen - duport , and benech in 1996  @xcite .",
    "using silicate - based glass io devices , laboratory and on - sky stellar interferograms were demonstrated at astronomical h ( 1.5 @xmath0 m  1.8 @xmath0 m ) and k ( 2.0 @xmath0 m ",
    "2.4 @xmath0 m ) bands  @xcite . in many situations , especially those involving nulling and exoplanet search , operation in the infrared beyond 3 @xmath0 m , where silicate - based glasses are not transparent ,",
    "is required .",
    "on - sky interferometric measurements have been performed in the l band ( 3.0 @xmath0 m  4.0 @xmath0 m ) using a guided - wave device , consisting of a two - beam fluoride glass fiber coupler , but this fiber - based technology is not easily scalable to multiple apertures  @xcite .",
    "we have recently developed a prototype , single - mode , integrated optic , astronomical , beam combiner fabricated by titanium - indiffusion in an x - cut , lithium niobate ( linbo@xmath1 ) wafer  @xcite .",
    "the device operates in the 3.2 @xmath0 m ",
    "3.8 @xmath0 m spectral region , which lies in the l band , and has on - chip , electro - optically ( eo ) controlled , fringe scanning capabilities .",
    "our results confirm that io devices are well suited to perform the beam combining function for astronomical imaging . in the infrared wavelength region ,",
    "a host star is normally a million times brighter than the planet orbiting it , which presents major difficulties when trying to image the planet directly . nulling interferometry offers the possibility to overcome this problem by attenuating the stellar light , thus enhancing the visibility of the planet",
    "generally , achromatic phase shifting and broadband achromatic beam combining functions are required for deep nulling , with nulling depths of 10@xmath2 or better over the infrared spectrum . although we can image the planet by nulling at a single wavelength , there are key reasons to use a broad wavelength band .",
    "first , there are several key biomarkers in the infrared spectrum from 6 @xmath0 m to 18 @xmath0 m .",
    "second , the total integration time needed to detect a planet increases as the spectral bandwidth is reduced .    one key component for achieving a broadband deep null is the broadband achromatic beam combiner . generally , there are two basic types of planar , integrated optic beam combiners : reversed - y combiners and directional couplers .",
    "the operation of a reversed - y combiner is achromatic by symmetry .",
    "a reversed - y combiner , however , when used as part of a nulling interferometer , suffers an inevitable 3 db loss of signal . on the other hand",
    ", directional coupler type beam combiners can capture the entire signal , and hence are theoretically lossless provided that both interferometric outputs are recorded and subtracted .",
    "unfortunately , the operation of the directional coupler is chromatic , and this wavelength dependence prevents the device from achieving deep broadband nulls .",
    "various approaches have been suggested to mitigate chromaticity of 2 by 2 couplers and achieve a wavelength flattened response .",
    "these approaches include ( i ) asymmetric directional couplers , where the two constituent waveguides differ in width but are uniform along the direction of propagation  @xcite , ( ii ) mach - zehnder type interferometers that are wavelength - insensitive  @xcite , and ( iii ) tapered velocity couplers , where the waveguide widths are varied along the propagation direction  @xcite .",
    "the operation of the devices described by ( i ) and ( ii ) above depend on the interference between modes , while the tapered velocity mode coupler ( iii ) is meant to operate adiabatically , where there is little coupling between the local normal modes .",
    "the later device is also referred to as a mode - evolution coupler .",
    "unfortunately these approaches do not yield an ultra - broadband achromatic response nor do they preserve the initial phase difference of the input beams in the interference term at the output .",
    "lack of broadband chromaticity in either power splitting or phase can seriously degrade the deep nulls required for exoplanets search . in this paper",
    ", we propose and present a theoretical design of an achromatic , broadband , polarization - insensitive , mode - evolution , integrated optic , beam combiner suited for space - based nulling interferometry .",
    "the design is based on a system of three coupled waveguides along the lines of  @xcite and  @xcite .",

    "the theory of normal modes of a three coupled waveguide system is presented . a design of an achromatic , polarization - insensitive",
    ", mode evolution beam combiner is proposed in section  [ proposeddesign ] . in section  [ cmtoflnm ] ,",
    "the derivation of the coupled mode equations that describe the mode coupling between the local normal modes is given , and a condition for adiabatic operation is presented . in section",
    "[ abcdesign ] , a numerical design example of the proposed achromatic beam combiner , based on candidate technologies for waveguide fabrication in mid - infrared wavelength region , is presented and the device performance is numerically evaluated .",
    "the results of the paper are summarized in section  [ abcdis ] .",
    "before we go into the details of the design of the proposed fully - achromatic , broadband , mode - evolution beam combiner , we first develop representations for the normal modes of a symmetric three coupled waveguide system shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : threewg ]  @xcite .",
    "the waveguides shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : threewg ] are assumed to be uniform , i.e. , do not change along the direction of propagation @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume that ( this assumption is valid when the waveguides are weakly coupled ) the total scalar ( te or tm ) field,@xmath4 , of the combined three waveguide structure can be approximately written as the weighted sum of the normalized waveguide modes , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , associated with each individual waveguide expressed in the single @xmath8 , @xmath9,@xmath3 coordinate system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : threewg ] .",
    "thus , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a real - valued quantity which describes the spatial profile of the mode and @xmath12 is the associated propagation constant . the coupled - mode equations describing this system are  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are mode propagation constants for outer waveguides and @xmath16 is that of the center waveguide , @xmath17 is the coupling coefficient between waveguides @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the complex - valued mode amplitudes associated with the individual waveguide modes in waveguides 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the outer waveguides are identical and equidistant from the center waveguide , and thus @xmath23 = @xmath24 and @xmath14 = @xmath15 .",
    "considering a longitudinally varying waveguide structure , the amplitudes of the local normal modes are not constant as a function of position along the waveguide .",
    "these longitudinally - varying local normal modes will be designated by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the local normal modes of the @xmath32 individual waveguides .",
    "thus we define @xmath33 as @xmath34 and write @xmath35 by substituting eq .   into eq .  , we obtain the following local normal modes of the three coupled waveguide structure @xmath36 and @xmath37 the waveguide parameter @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . in general , the mode profile of a single local normal mode will evolve as it propagates along a longitudinally - varying waveguide structure .",
    "if we consider the three local normal modes of the combined longitudinally - varying three - waveguide structure , it is easily verified that @xmath41 , associated with the antisymmetric mode , remains constant along the whole structure .",
    "the other two symmetric local normal modes are identified by their mode order , i.e. , by the relative magnitudes of their propagation constants , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . the lowest order mode will be identified by the subscript @xmath44 , and the third mode is identified by the subscript @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 ) .",
    "generally , power transfer occurs between the local normal modes of a longitudinally - varying structure .",
    "the degree of power transfer between the local normal modes is a function of the overlap parameter between their spatial mode profiles , @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "this overlap parameter is given by  @xcite @xmath50 when @xmath51 , as occurs for a structure that does not change along the propagation direction @xmath3 , there is no power exchange .",
    "similarly if the structure varies slowly enough in z , then @xmath52 will be small and @xmath53 will be approximately zero .",
    "thus there will be little power exchange between the local normal modes .",
    "we propose a design of waveguide structures that are neither invariant along z nor vary slowly along z but for which @xmath54 and @xmath55 . when there is very little power transfer between the local normal modes , the mode propagation is said to be _",

    "the width of the center waveguide is kept fixed while the widths of the outer waveguides are equal to one another at all points along @xmath3 but are varied along @xmath3 to achieve the desired dephasing @xmath65 .",
    "note that the separation between waveguide 1 and 3 is assumed to be sufficiently large so that @xmath66 and thus can be neglected .",
    "the coupling term , @xmath67 , and the dephasing term , @xmath68 , of the waveguide structure are chosen as indicated in table  [ tab : wgparameters ] .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ abcdesign ] that the waveguide transition can be made nearly adiabatic ( i.e. , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "thus the power in each local normal mode will remain constant as the mode propagates along the length of the structure , although the shape of each local normal mode will gradually evolve due to the adiabatic change of the waveguide parameters .",
    "the antisymmetric mode @xmath59 and the lowest order symmetric mode @xmath58 at @xmath69 will evolve into the following forms , @xmath70 respectively , at the output @xmath71 .",
    "thus by superposition the total output at @xmath71 becomes @xmath72 therefore , the intensities at outputs of waveguides 1 , 2 , and 3 at @xmath71 are given @xmath73 from these expressions we see that the total power in all three waveguides combined is @xmath64 , and thus there is no loss in power . furthermore , the input phase difference , @xmath63 , is preserved in the output interference term , @xmath74 , which is wavelength and polarization independent , guaranteeing fully achromatic and polarization - insensitive operation .",
    "the definition of an adiabatic waveguide transition is a transition between two waveguide structures that takes place in such a manner that negligible power transfer occurs between the normal modes as they propagate from one structure to the other .",
    "lack of mode conversion facilitates device design and can lead to wavelength insensitive operation as seen in sec .",
    "[ proposeddesign ] .",
    "conventionally , the suppression of mode conversion has been achieved by slowly varying the waveguide structure along the direction of propagation .",
    "it was recently suggested , however , that a slow longitudinal variation , though sufficient , is not necessary to achieve adiabatic operation .",
    "more generally , the suppression of mode conversion is rooted in the small magnitude of the nonadiabatic term itself  @xcite .",
    "thus conventional notions of adiabaticity based on slowly varying changes can be abandoned , and a new and different type of adiabaticity based on a controlled interaction can be exploited . in this section , the coupling equations governing the power transfer between local normal modes and the expression for the nonadiabatic term will be derived .      in order to calculate the spatial variation of electric field @xmath75 and magnetic field @xmath76 of the optical waveguide structure shown in fig .",

    "@xmath84 is the free space wavenumber , @xmath85 is the vacuum speed of light and @xmath86 is the wavelength of light in free space .",
    "although it is not necessary to do so , we will adopt a scalar analysis , and thus the last term in eq .   will be neglected .",
