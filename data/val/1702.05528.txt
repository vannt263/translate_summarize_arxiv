    "relays are widely used to extend the coverage of wireless networks without expensive payload backhaul .",
    "however , it was shown that relays can not provide degrees of freedom ( dof ) gain in conventional wireless networks @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that if relays are allowed to deliver cached information beside instantaneous information , the dof of the network increases @xcite .",
    "the benefits of caching stem from the fact that a currently - delivered data file may be requested again in the future .",
    "caching schemes were first proposed for improving the performance of operating systems @xcite .",
    "after that , various caching applications have been proposed .",
    "many web caching schemes have been presented such as @xcite with the aim of sustaining the data flow of the internet . in @xcite ,",
    "caching was used to reduce the number of hops from the source to the destination , and hence , the delay was reduced . in @xcite ,",
    "the aim of caching was to reduce the peak traffic by duplicating some contents in distributed memories across the network .",
    "this duplication occurs over the off - peak hours .",
    "the duplicated contents can be used during the peak hours to reduce network congestion .",
    "small cell caching was used to improve the area spectral efficiency of video transmission in cellular systems @xcite .",
    "an information theoretic formulation of the caching problem was presented in @xcite . however , all these works separated caching from the physical layer ( phy ) .    in @xcite , it was shown that the one - shot sum - dof grows linearly with the aggregate cache size in the network .",
    "also , it was recently shown in @xcite that phy caching can provide dof gain in a single cell with a caching relay , as the topology of the relay channel is transformed into a broadcast channel when the requested content exists in the base station ( bs ) and the relay station ( rs ) simultaneously .",
    "however , the results in @xcite can not be directly extended to the case of multiple cells .",
    "for example , consider a simple network with @xmath0 single antenna users , two non - cooperative @xmath1-antenna bss and two non - cooperative @xmath1-antenna rss each with cache of size @xmath2 ( one for each bs ) .",
    "assuming that the bss do not have any contents in common , the two bss can not use the channel simultaneously , and hence , we have to assign the channel for only one of them at each time instant .",
    "thus , we have no dof gain over @xcite in this case .",
    "however , in this paper we show that using a single shared rs with @xmath3 antennas and cache of size @xmath4 instead of two separate rss can greatly improve the dof beyond those achieved by direct extension of the scheme in @xcite .     with the help of the shared rs ,",
    "while the dashed lines in ( b ) represents the transmission of parity bits not in the rs cache where dof@xmath5.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in this paper , we propose a novel scheme to exploit _ cache - induced opportunistic mimo cooperation _",
    "@xcite in relay networks with multiple non - cooperative bss .",
    "in particular , we exploit the benefit of having a shared relay station ( rs ) which significantly increases the dof gain over the results of @xcite .",
    "this dof improvement can be attributed to the ability of a bs to use the shared rs when the other bs can not benefit from the existence of the rs as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we propose a cache - assisted relaying protocol using maximum distance separable ( mds ) coding which improves the opportunity of mimo cooperation between the bss and the rs .",
    "next , we propose a global - optimal cache content placement solution and a low - complexity self - learning algorithm to find a near - optimal cache content placement solution that does not require prior knowledge of the popularity of the content files .",
    "the mathematical notation used in this paper is as follows .",
    "the superscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the transpose and the hermitian transpose respectively .",
    "the indicator function @xmath8 returns @xmath9 when the event @xmath10 is true , otherwise it returns @xmath11 .",
    "consider a cached relay network composed of two non - cooperative -antenna bss ( designated as bs1 and bs2 ) and a -antenna shared relay with cache of size .",
    "each bs is connected to a gateway .",
    "there are single antenna users requesting files from any of the content gateways via the relay network where .",
    "we denote the total number of available content files by @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the rs stores a fraction of each content file .",
    "each user has the freedom to request any of the available @xmath12 files and the bs which connected to the gateway containing the requested file serves the user subsequently possibly with the assistance of the relay .",
    "we assume that each user has a long sequence of requested files .",
    "time is slotted with time slots indexed by @xmath13 where the duration of each time slot is .",
    "the index of the file requested by user is denoted by whose size is given by .",
    "we define the user request profile ( urp ) as the @xmath14 vector whose @xmath15th entry contains the index of the file requested by user @xmath15 , i.e. , .",
    "we assume that has a general distribution which changes over a slow timescale .",
    "we also assume that the packets of the content files are delivered to each bs via a high speed backhaul connection and that the rs has no fixed - line backhaul connection to any of the bss .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the set containing the network nodes where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote respectively the @xmath20th bs , rs , and the @xmath15th user .",
    "we use @xmath21 to denote the matrix containing the coefficients of the channel from transmitter node @xmath22 to receiver node @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the channel matrices have i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian entries with zero - mean and unit - variance and are independent of each other .",
    "we consider a block fading channel where all the channel matrices remain constant within a time slot but are i.i.d . across the time slots .",
    "the transmission power of each bs is bounded by @xmath25 while the transmission power of the rs is bounded by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .      in this subsection",
    ", we present the proposed cache - assisted relaying protocol .",
    "each bs divides each of its available content files into segments of size bits each .",
    "these segments of the @xmath28th file are encoded into parity bits using an mds rateless code , where is the _ cache content placement variable_. the parity bits will be cached at the rs .",
    "an mds rateless code generates a codeword of arbitrary length from information bits , such that if the decoder receives any parity bits , it can recover the original information bits .",
    "the mds rateless code can be implemented using raptor codes @xcite with a small redundancy overhead .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , mds encoding highly improves the probability of mimo cooperative transmission .",
    "after that , the cache - assisted relaying protocol follows the following phases      the parity bits for every segment of the th content file for @xmath29 are transmitted offline to the rs and stored in the rs cache .",
    "we define the _ cache content placement vector _ as the @xmath30 vector whose @xmath28th component is the cache content placement variable of the @xmath28th file , i.e. , @xmath31^t$ ] . the cache content does not change for each instantaneous realization of .",
    "it should be designed according to the distribution of rather than its instantaneous realization .",
    "thus , the change of the rs cache contents occurs over a slow timescale with small average network loading .",
    "it was previously shown in @xcite that phy caching can opportunistically transform the unfavorable relay channel into a more favorable broadcast channel for cached relay networks with a single cell .",
    "we will extend this result to cached relay networks with multiple bss .",
    "moreover , we will investigate the benefit of having a shared rs rather than two separate rss .",
    "this benefit is because each bs can use the shared rs at the time slots where the other bs does not need it .",
    "let denote the set of users that requested files stored in the content gateway of the @xmath20th bs .",
    "let also denote the cache content placement variable of the file requested by the @xmath15th ordered user that belongs to , where @xmath32 and denotes the @xmath15th minimum element in the set .",
