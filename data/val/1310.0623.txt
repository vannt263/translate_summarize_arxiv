    "a first approach follows from the notion that in the absence of an exciton pairing interaction @xmath1 the interlayer hopping @xmath7 will automatically create a doping dependence of the interlayer tunneling .",
    "therefore we separate the contribution to interlayer tunneling that arises due to exciton formation from the part that is already present at @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 - 1 ] we show how this relative interlayer tunneling depends on temperature and chemical potential for fixed @xmath10 .",

    "[ fig4 - 6 ] .",
    "the strongest tendency towards interlayer tunneling is indeed at @xmath2 doping , for the largest values of interaction @xmath1 .",
