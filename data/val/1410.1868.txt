    "we we will argue that interplay of these domains at finite temperatures can be captured by a two - component isotropic ashkin - teller model , and allude to the finite temperature phase diagram for the surface states beyond the mean field approximation .    before concluding the section a discussion on the nature of the nematic order seems appropriate .",
    "notice that the nematic phase is described by a fluctuating excitonic order that does not acquire a finite vacuum expectation value .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction that depending on the relative strength of nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hybridization amplitude among the opposite parity orbitals ( such as @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) in the bulk , the chiralities of electron and hole pockets can be same or opposite , which in turn determines the nature of density - wave excitonic order ( sdw or cdw ) .",

    "next we characterize each of these phases in terms of original order parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the nematic phase is ordered along either @xmath54 or @xmath55 in such a way that a large density of sign flips ( domain wall ) of the order parameter proliferate in the system . in this phase @xmath147 or @xmath148 is non - zero , but @xmath149 .",
    "consequently , the nematic phase breaks the @xmath15 rotational symmetry , yet still retains the translational invariance of the the system . only at lower temperature , through a subsequent transition system enters into the ordered / baxter phase , where both nematic and density - wave orders develop non - zero expectation value .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar , but distinct , nematic phase has also been studied for iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "in summary , we discuss various many - body instabilities on the surface of strongly interacting cubic tkis .",
    "we show that if the chemical potential is placed in between the dirac points at the @xmath10 and @xmath22 points of the surface bz and the resulting electron ( near @xmath9 and @xmath11 points ) and hole ( near @xmath10 point ) pockets are of comparable size , fermions can condense into a nematic and density - wave phase . in this phase",
    "only one of the electron pockets participates in excitonic pairing , and thus the 4-fold rotation symmetry on the surface gets lifted spontaneously .",
    "therefore , our results provide a possible explanation for the recently observed @xmath27 symmetric magnetoresistence @xcite and the upturn in surface resistivity with tunable gate voltage or equivalently the chemical potential @xcite in smb@xmath0 .",
    "the excitonic phase , however , can display a spin- or charge - density wave ordering depending on the relative chirality of the dirac cones with electron and hole like carriers . in sec .",
    "ii , we argued that due to the presence of underlying strong spin - orbit coupling that causes spin(in - plane components)-momentum locking of the surface states @xcite , and only the @xmath23-component of electrons spin participates in various instabilities , which in turn also allows the system to exhibit long - range order at finite-@xmath105 .",
    "our results are substantiated by complimentary ginzburg - landau analysis of order parameters ( for small fermi surface mismatch ) in sec .",
    "iii and the free - energy minimization in mean - field approximation ( for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath150 ) in sec .",
    "iv . for large fermi mismatch ,",
    "on the other hand , our mean - field analysis predicts that both electron pockets gets involved in excitonic ordering , and the ordered phase restores the 4-fold rotational symmetry of the surface bz .",
    "furthermore , we extend our analysis beyond the mean - field level , and account for thermal fluctuations and domain walls when the system condenses into a @xmath27 density - wave phase in sec .",
    "v. in this limit , the system can be described by a two - component isotropic ashkin - teller model and we presented a finite temperature phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ ashkinteller ] . for small fermi surface mismatch , both nematic and",
    "density - wave orders condense at the same temperature in agreement with our mean - field analysis .",
    "only for substantial fermi surface mismatch , these two transitions take place at different temperatures .",
    "system first pairs into a nematic phase and yet at a lower temperature to an excitonic ( baxter ) phase .",
    "although our study is primarily motivated by ongoing experimental works in smb@xmath0 @xcite that are suggestive of the presence of strong electronic correlations on its surface , it can describe various signature of electron - electron interactions on the surface of other strongly interacting cubic tis , such as ybb@xmath0 @xcite , pub@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "various recent experiments have extracted the effective parameters for the surface band structure .",
    "for example , arpes experiments have found the ellipticity factor @xmath151  @xcite not too large in smb@xmath0 . extracting the energy offset among the dirac points in an experiment",
    "is a challenging task . nevertheless , various first - principle  @xcite and effective band structure  @xcite calculations suggest that @xmath152 mev",
    ". the estimated values of these parameters indicates that while the ellipticity of the fermi pockets is not too large to destroy the propensity of nematic and excitonic orderings on the surface , a large offset among the dirac points allow one to tune the surface chemical potential over a reasonably wide range to realize electron and hole pockets of comparable sizes thourhg external gating  @xcite , conducive for orderings .",
    "therefore , with currently estimated values of these band parameters , it is quite conceivable that surface states of smb@xmath0 or other cubic tkis ( such as ybb@xmath0 and pub@xmath0 ) can accommodate various exotic broken symmetry phases .",
    "detection of the nematic or the @xmath27 symmetric excitonic orderings demands direction dependent measurements of transport quantities , for example . here , we focus only on the @xmath27 symmetry breaking ordering , as it occupies most of the phase diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase0p2 ] .",
    "notice in the nematic and the excitonic phases the four - fold rotational symmetry gets broken , while the former one is deviod of uniform condensation of any order parameter .",
    "therefore , to pin the the onset of these orderings one needs to perform direction dependent measurements of various physical quantities , such as conductivity , resistivity , magnetoresistence , on the surface that can sense the lack of rotational symmetry in the close proximity to an ordering .",
    "recent experiment  @xcite has reported the lack of four fold rotational symmetry in magnetoresistance in smb@xmath0 below 5k , which is suggestive of at least a nematic ordering on the surface .",
    "it should be noted that the surface bz of cubic tki closely is similar to the one in pnictides  @xcite .",
    "however , there exist several crucial differences between these two systems .",
    "for example , due to the strong spin - orbit coupling the sdw order of the surface states breaks only the discrete @xmath2 symmetry [ note that the valley @xmath88 symmetry of sdw order is only an artifact of the low energy approximation in eqs .",
    "( [ freehamil ] ) , ( [ eq : hshamiltonian ] ) which gets reduced to @xmath2 due to the presence of an underlying lattice captured by the term @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( [ symbreaking ] ) ] , responsible for true long - range order , whereas spin - rotation is a good symmetry and the sdw phase breaks continuous @xmath154 symmetry in pnictides @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fermi surfaces on the surface of tkis constitute vortices or anti - vortices in momentum space that in turn encode the bulk topological invariance of the system , while the bands in pnictide materials are regular non - relativistic parabolic bands",
    ". consequently , the regular parabolic bands and therefore the sdw order in pnictides can carry additional orbital degeneracy , which depends on various nonuniversal details of the system @xcite , whereas the non - interacting model [ see eq .",
    "( [ freehamil ] ) ] and the sdw / cdw order [ see eq.([eq : hshamiltonian ] ) ] we consider for the surface states tkis is constrained by nontrivial bulk topological invariant .",
    "thus , neither sdw nor cdw is accompanied by additional degeneracy . in additional , contrast to our results",
    ", a recent theoretical study finds that the transition from paramagnetic-@xmath27 sdw in pnictide is discontinuous or first order in nature @xcite . despite these fundamental differences ,",
    "we find that the qualitative structure of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase0p2 ] for the surface states of tkis bears some similarities to the one for iron pnictides both calculated theoretically @xcite and also with the one obtained experimentally ( see the phase digram of ba@xmath155na@xmath156fe@xmath1as@xmath1 in fig .  2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the similarity between such different systems is both surprising and encouraging .",
    "therefore , we expect that our study will initiate future works related to tkis that may unearth some exotic effects due to the presence of strong electronic correlations in these systems and may as well shed light into the phase diagram of iron pnictides .    as a final remark , we highlight some other possible phenomena , arising from strong residual electronic interactions on the surface of tkis , among which the renormalization of plasmon spectrum due to strong fluctuations  @xcite , non - fermi liquid phase for @xmath5-electrons  @xcite , quasi - particle inteference  @xcite , and spontaneous valley hall ordering in the presence of strong magnetci field  @xcite . in addition ,",
    "a spatial variation of the hybridization has been proposed to lead to a topological chiral - liquid on the surface  @xcite , without destroying the helical structure of the surface states ( protected by bulk topological invariant ) . while these proposals are quite fascinating and of definite fundamental importance , our work focuses on the possibilities of realizing various broken symmetry phases ( excitonic and nematic ) on the surface of tki , resulting from strong residual interactions , which can explain some peculiar experimental observations in recent past  @xcite .",
