    "to detect the feeble flux of predicted high energy astrophysical neutrinos , high energy cherenkov neutrino telescopes are build as a grid of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) covering a huge geometric volume .",
    "the density of pmts per effective detector area is about 3 orders of magnitude below that for -events triggered in the superkamiokande detector ; this implies a detailed verification of the anticipated performance of these new detectors .",
    "the amanda - ii telescope is located at the geographic south pole and uses the transparent ice of the 3  km thick ice sheet @xcite .",
    "the detector has been installed between november 1995 and february 2000 , and consists of 677 pmts in optical modules ( om ) on 19 vertical strings deployed to depths between 1300m-2400 m .",
    "the main instrumented volume ranges from 1500m-2000 m , it covers a cylinder of 200 m diameter ( fig.[fig : detector_layout ] ) .",
    "strings 1 - 10 form the inner detector of 120 m diameter called amanda - b10 , which was commissioned in 1997 .",
    "they use passive oms with electrical analog signal transmission over 2 km cable .",
    "strings 11 - 19 form the outer cylinder and are based on analog fiber transmission @xcite .",
    "[ fig : detector_layout ]    first physics results obtained with amanda - b10 are presented at this conference by @xcite .",
    "with no astrophysical neutrino sources detected yet , atmospheric neutrinos are the only source to calibrate the sensitivity to the favoured -channel : upgoing @xmath0 s generated in charged current ( cc ) -interactions .     [",
    "fig : cthe_b10 ]    muon track reconstruction is based on a maximum likelidood fit of measured photon arrival times to expected arrival time distributions @xcite@xcite , and uses modeled optical bulk ice properties ( light scattering and absorption ) , and local hole ice effects .",
    "light emitted by muon - induced electromagnetic showers and accompanying muons ( not in the track fit model ) and the low information density per track result in downgoing atmospheric muons being sometimes misreconstructed as upward tracks .",
    "they form the dominant background to s , since they trigger about 10@xmath1 more abundant .",
    "the 1997 data set of the amanda - b10 detector has been analyzed by two independent groups .",
    "they used different modifications of track reconstruction and extended cuts for selecting highest quality upward reconstructed muon tracks to reject the background at acceptable signal efficiencies . from a total sample of 10@xmath2 events triggered during 130 effective livetime days in 1997",
    ", final samples of 223 and 204 events have been extracted , with passing rates of 3 - 4% and residual background contamination of 10% @xcite@xcite .",
    "the observed number of events is consistent with expectation , within a @xmath350% systematic error due to ice property and primary flux uncertainties . in figure",
    "[ fig : cthe_b10 ] the distribution in cosine of the zenith angle after final cuts for the sample of analysis a is shown ( compared to -simulation expectation , normalized to experimental data ) .",
    "angular acceptance of amanda - b10 is seen to be worst for horizontal directions . the angular and energy averaged effective muon area for muon energies of 0.1 - 1tev is 2800m@xmath4 ( weighted over the atmospheric -spectrum ) .",
    "much higher effective areas are observed for other searches ( see below ) .",
    "the amanda - ii telescope is in stable operation since its commissioning in february , 2000 .",
    "reasonable agreement is found between data and simulation @xcite .    for neutrinos from astrophysical sources ( such as active galactic nuclei , agn ) , harder spectra than for atmospheric neutrinos",

    "[ fig : aeff_aii_costh ] , the calculated amanda - ii effective area for 10tev muons is shown as function of the zenith angle at trigger level @xcite .",

    "the amanda - ii telescope reaches effective muon detection areas at 10tev of up to 50000m@xmath4 , depending on the physics objective , and offers better angular coverage than amanda - b10 .",
    "the latter was proven to work as a high energy neutrino detector by the isolation of a combined sample of 325 atmospheric s .",
    "the rate of atmospheric events for the full amanda - ii detector will be about 3 times higher , yielding 800 - 1000 s for year 2000 . flux limits obtainable by amanda - ii for high energy neutrinos from diffuse and point sources will improve by @xmath310 times within 2 years of livetime @xcite .",
