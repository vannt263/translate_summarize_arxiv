    "an interesting phenomenon involving crossing d - branes has recently been discovered @xcite . when a d@xmath6-brane and a d@xmath7-brane that are mutually transverse cross , a fundamental string is created between them .",
    "this effect is related by u - duality to the creation of a d3-brane when appropriately oriented neveu - schwarz and dirichlet 5-branes cross @xcite .",
    "these , and all other brane - creation phenomena can be obtained from m - theory , where crossing m5-branes lead to the creation of an m2-brane @xcite . a m(atrix ) theory origin of this phenomenon has also been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "an example of a system exhibiting the string creation effect is the d0-d8 system in type iia string theory . unlike the other d@xmath8d@xmath7 systems ,",
    "this system is further constrained by charge conservation to include vacuum strings between the branes @xcite .",
    "the resulting force between the d0- and the d8-brane vanishes , and the system is in a bps state @xcite .",
    "this system is closely related to the 9-dimensional type i string theory @xcite which is t - dual to type i on @xmath9 .",
    "as type i string theory is unoriented , type i string theory contains two orientifold fixed planes , and the theory lives on @xmath10 , where the interval @xmath11 is bounded by the two orientifold planes .",
    "in addition , the @xmath12 chan - paton factors of type i ( 32 d9-branes ) become sixteen parallel d8-branes in type i ( together with their sixteen images on the other side of the fixed planes ) , and their positions in the interval are determined by a wilson line in the type i theory . the conserved charges of type",
    "i string theory are kaluza - klein ( kk ) momentum and d - string winding number , and those of type i are winding number and d - particle number .",
    "the system contains d0- and d8-branes as well as fundamental strings , and the above effect should therefore play an important role in the non - perturbative regime of the theory .",
    "type i string theory has been conjectured to be s - dual to the @xmath13 heterotic string theory @xcite .",
    "the map relating the two theories compactified on @xmath9 is given by @xcite [ hettypei ] _",
    "i = 1_h , g_mn^i = g_mn^h_h , r_i = r_h , where @xmath14 is the ten - dimensional metric ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the heterotic and type i coupling constants , and the radius of the circle is @xmath18 and @xmath19 when measured in the heterotic and type i metrics , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see from these relations that heterotic kk momentum is mapped to type i kk momentum , and that heterotic winding number is mapped to d - string winding number in type i. on the other hand , the winding number of the fundamental string in type i is not a conserved quantity , and it does not have a dual description in the heterotic string theory . combining the above s - duality map with the t - duality map relating type i and type i , _",
    "i = _ ir_i , g_mn^i = g_mn^i , r_i = 1r_i , [ simpletduality ] we find that the heterotic and type i parameters are related as _",
    "i = 1 r_h , g_mn^i = g_mn^h_h , r_i = r_h .",
    "[ simplesduality ] in particular , the heterotic kk momentum is mapped to type i winding , and heterotic winding is mapped to the d0-brane number in type i. the kk momentum is not a conserved quantity in type i ( it is related to the winding of the fundamental string in type i ) , and it therefore has no heterotic dual .",
    "the simple relations in ( [ simpletduality ] ) and ( [ simplesduality ] ) hold only when eight d8-branes are fixed at the location of each orientifold plane , which corresponds to the wilson line @xmath20 , breaking @xmath12 to @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", the type i background metric is flat and the dilaton is constant , and it is therefore possible to define a ( global ) string coupling constant as @xmath22 .",
    "this case is also special in the sense that the 9-dimensional @xmath13 heterotic theory for which the gauge group has been broken to @xmath21 is t - dual to a suitable compactification of the @xmath23 heterotic string theory ( where again the gauge group has been broken to @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies a duality between the @xmath23 heterotic theory and type i , which has been explored in @xcite . from the point of view of m - theory ,",
    "this duality is simply the exchange of two compact directions , one of which is @xmath24 and the other @xmath11 .",
    "this has in turn been exploited to construct the heterotic matrix theory @xcite .    for wilson lines other than @xmath25",
    "the situation is more complicated . in particular , the dilaton of type i is then not constant along the interval , the metric is curved , and the simple duality relations ( [ simpletduality ] ) and ( [ simplesduality ] ) no longer hold .",
    "furthermore , since the two heterotic theories are not related by t - duality in the general case , type i is then not related to the @xmath23 theory , and therefore has no simple m - theory interpretation .",
    "the wilson lines @xmath26 ( which in type i correspond to backgrounds with @xmath27 d8-branes at one fixed plane and @xmath28 at the other ) were partially explored in @xcite . the heterotic theories in this class exhibit , at particular radii ( which depend on @xmath29 ) , gauge enhancement to exceptional groups , and it was shown that this occurs whenever the type i theory develops a region where the coupling diverges .",
    "it is then possible that additional states become massless , thereby avoiding a potential contradiction of the duality with the fact that type i ( or type i ) does not possess a perturbative gauge enhancement mechanism .    on the other hand ,",
    "the precise form of the duality map was not analyzed in @xcite , and it is clear that it can not be as simple as in the @xmath30 case .",
    "in particular , type i winding is quantized in multiples of @xmath31 , as a single open string which stretches from a d8-brane at one end to a d8-brane at the other end has winding number @xmath31 , and a single closed string which winds around the whole interval has winding number @xmath32 .",
    "the heterotic kk momentum , on the other hand , is shifted due to the presence of the wilson line , and it is not always half - integral .",
    "in fact , for @xmath33 the heterotic kk momentum is half - integral , but for @xmath34 , it is of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , and for odd @xmath29 , it is of the form @xmath37 .",
    "if the simple duality map were true , this would give unphysical values for the type i winding number .",
    "it is one of the aims of this paper to derive the correct duality map in these cases , and to demonstrate that it gives rise to type i winding which is always half - integral .",
    "the critical observation is that the heterotic kk momentum is mapped to a state which has , in addition to the d0-branes , a certain amount of type i winding .",
    "we will also show that the actual value of the type i winding number is somewhat ambiguous as it depends in general on the positions of the d0-branes along the interval .",
    "in particular , the difference in mass of a d0-brane as it changes its position can be absorbed into a shift of the winding number , and this can be understood as a consequence of the macroscopic d0-d8 strings , which were shown to be present in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the creation of d0-d8 strings can be demonstrated by analyzing the system as a function of the positions of the d8-branes ; our analysis of the duality map between bps states in the heterotic and type i string theories therefore gives further ( and independent ) evidence for this phenomenon .",
    "it will also become apparent that the relevant bps states in type i preserve supersymmetry . in the presence of d0- and",
    "d8-branes , this amounts to the condition that the string has a definite orientation , and we demonstrate that this follows from the bps condition of the heterotic theory @xcite .",
    "this latter condition requires that the right - moving oscillators are in their ground states , and for non - zero winding number ( _ i.e. _ in the presence of d0-branes ) this roughly implies that kk momentum can only flow in one direction , and therefore that type i strings can only wind in one direction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review nine - dimensional heterotic string theory and gauge enhancement . in section  3",
    "we derive the precise heterotic - type i duality map , including both heterotic momentum and winding , and show that the type i winding is always physical and supersymmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ half - integer and non - positive . in section  4",
    "we use the duality to exhibit the creation of d0-d8 strings by following the behavior of certain states as the wilson line is varied , and discuss the role these strings play in gauge enhancement . in section  5 we present some conclusions , and comment on the predictions of the present analysis with regards to the d0-brane quantum mechanics . we have included two short appendices : in the first we give a table of the lightest type i bps states for a small number of d0-branes , and in the second we generalize the results of section  3 to wilson lines corresponding to bulk d8-branes .    while this paper was being finalized , a paper @xcite appeared where some results which overlap with section  3 are obtained .",
    "let us consider the @xmath13 heterotic string theory compactified on @xmath24 with radius @xmath39 and a background gauge field @xmath40 .",
    "the left- and right - moving momenta are @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an element of the @xmath13 lattice @xmath43 , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the kk momentum and winding numbers , respectively .",
    "the mass spectrum is given by m_h^2 = 12p_l^2 + 2_h^(n_l -1 ) + 12p_r^2 + 2_h^(n_r -c ) , where @xmath46 are the right and left - moving oscillator numbers , and @xmath47 or @xmath31 depending on whether the right - moving fermions are periodic ( r ) or anti - periodic ( ns ) .",
    "physical states satisfy the level matching condition p_l^2",
    "+ 4_h^(n_l -1 ) = p_r^2 + 4_h^(n_r -c ) , and bps states are given by the further requirement that @xmath48 .",
    "the condition for states to be physical and bps - saturated is thus p_l^2 - p_r^2 = 4_h^ ( 1 - n_l ) , which can be simplified to p^2 + n_hw_h = 1 - n_l .",
    "[ physicalbps ] in this case , the mass formula becomes m^2_h , bps = p_r^2 = ( n_h - ap - w_ha^2/2r_h - w_hr_h_h^ ) ^2 .",
    "[ hetbps ] for example , states with @xmath49 and @xmath50 include the gravity multiplet and the vector multiplets associated with the cartan generators of the gauge group .",
    "additional massless vectors , associated to the roots of the underlying gauge group , have @xmath51 , and therefore satisfy p_r^2 = 0 , p_l^2 = 4 _ h^ . at zero winding number this gives the roots of the subgroup of @xmath12 which is left unbroken by the wilson line , and for a generic radius @xmath18 there are no further massless gauge bosons .",
    "however , if the radius satisfies r_h^2 = _ h^(1 - a^2/2 ) , [ radius ] where @xmath52 is the length of the shortest vector of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 , there exist additional massless vectors for non - zero winding number which give rise to an ` enhancement ' of the gauge symmetry",
    ".    in this paper we shall be mostly interested in the case where the wilson line is of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "this class of theories exhibits an interesting pattern of gauge enhancements ( table 1 ) . when @xmath57 ( free - fermionic point ) , and su(18 ) when @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "] at a generic radius , the unbroken gauge group is @xmath60 . for @xmath61 , the smaller @xmath62 group ,",
    "together with one of the @xmath63 s is enhanced at the critical radius r_h^c(n ) = [ critical ] to @xmath64 . on the other hand , for @xmath30 ,",
    "the critical radius is @xmath65 , and both @xmath66 groups are enhanced to @xmath67 . in this case",
    "all winding numbers contribute to the gauge enhancement .",
    "this reflects the fact that a new continuum degree of freedom has appeared ; indeed , by t - duality , the @xmath30 theory at @xmath68 is really the ten - dimensional @xmath23 heterotic string theory @xcite .",

    "the representation @xmath72 corresponds to the weight @xmath73 with an even number of @xmath74 signs , and the representation @xmath75 corresponds to an odd number of @xmath74 signs . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the representations of @xmath77 are labeled by their @xmath63-charge @xmath78 modulo @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "brackets denote higher dimensional representations in the same conjugacy class of the given representation .",
    "some of the states in table  3 can be obtained from the states with @xmath84 by moving a single d8-brane from @xmath85 to @xmath86 as in section  4 .",
    "for example , the states @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , are connected in this way . on the other hand",
    "the other state at @xmath92 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) does not arise in this way .",
    "in this appendix we will derive the map between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , in the case where some d8-branes are in the bulk .",
    "we shall consider specifically the situation where the wilson line of the heterotic theory is @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    on the type i side this corresponds to the configuration where ( @xmath101 ) d8-branes are at @xmath102 , ( @xmath103 )",

    "however the calculation is somewhat more elaborate as the connection between @xmath108 and @xmath115 is rather complicated , as can be seen from equation ( [ para ] ) .",
