    "npic has been used to study the dynamics of thin current layers [ _ daughton _ , 2002 ; _ daughton _ , 2003 ]    implicit pic methods are particularly suitable when simulating systems with higher mass ratios .",
    "the cost of an explicit simulation on ion time and space scales varies with the ion to electron mass ratio as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of spatial dimensions [ _ pritchett _ , 2000 ] .",
    "for example , in two dimensions , a simulation of the gem challenge with @xmath26 is more than @xmath46 times as expensive as one with @xmath25 if the explicit method is used .",
    "in contrast , the cost of an implicit simulation scales as @xmath47 , as the time step can be kept constant with respect to the ion plasma frequency and the ratio @xmath48 is scaled as @xmath47 , in order to maintain the same harris sheet equilibrium [ _ ricci et al .",

    "the high mass ratio simulations are performed by celeste3d with the same simulation parameters , except for the @xmath26 case where the time step is reduced to @xmath54 . with @xmath25 , npic employs a @xmath55 grid , @xmath56 computational particles and a time step corresponding to @xmath57 for @xmath42 , and @xmath58 at @xmath43 . for the high mass ratio cases",

    "the reconnected fluxes for mass ratios @xmath63 and @xmath64 from the two codes show a remarkable agreement .",
    "a detailed comparison of the electron dynamics for @xmath25 has been performed , which shows that the physical mechanisms revealed by the two codes agree , although celeste3d does not resolve all the electron scales .",
    "in fact , it is important to note that even at the mass ratio @xmath63 , the celeste3d grid does not resolve the electron scales ; in particular , the electron debye length @xmath65 , the electron skin depth @xmath66 , the electron gyroradius @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) are not resolved .",
    "certainly , the accuracy of wave - particle interactions on the fast time scale is reduced using a coarser grid and a bigger time step .",
    "however , results of the simulations shown here and many previous simulations show that kinetic electrons seem to contribute correctly on the ion time scales : generally speaking , kinetic electrons contribute inertial effects , anisotropic pressure , and electron thermal transport on the ion time scales that would otherwise have to be modelled if fluid electron equations were used [ _ forslund and brackbill _ , 1982 ; _ brackbill et al .",

    "ricci et al . _ , 2002a ] . in particular , in the presence of a guide field reconnection still occurs but it requires a longer time and saturates at a lower level .",
    "the current is considerably more filamentary and peaks of negative current appear which are not present in the standard gem challenge with no guide field .    in fig .",
    "1 , the reconnection rates for both npic and celeste3d simulations are shown .",
    "the reconnected flux is measured as the flux difference , @xmath78 , between the x and the o points .",
    "all the simulations show a similar evolution .",
    "after slow initial growth , which lasts until @xmath79 ( or longer , for higher guide fields ) , reconnection enters a fast phase that persists until the saturation level is reached . during the fast reconnection phase , both npic and celeste3d ( when simulations with enhanced spatial resolution are performed )",
    "show multiple small scale islands , which merge at later time into a single island .",
    "in general , the reconnection rate decreases as the guide field increases for all values of the mass ratio . however , a fast reconnection phase is always present .",
    "the saturation level also decreases with the guide field , because the out - of - plane magnetic field influences the plasma motion reducing its compressibility .",
    "it is also shown that the reconnection rate depends weakly on the mass ratio for all the guide fields considered .",
    "simulations are performed with @xmath80 with the implicit pic code celeste3d and with @xmath81 for the explicit pic code npic . for the reconnected flux ,",
    "the results of the explicit and implicit simulations agree remarkably well for both mass ratios . in some cases ,",
    "the fast reconnection phase starts earlier in implicit simulations ; nevertheless , both the reconnection rate and the saturation level is similar in the two codes .",
    "the later start is probably due to the reduced initial noise in the explicit simulation because of much larger number of particles .",
    "> from an energetic point of view , the reconnection process causes a decrease of the total magnetic energy , because the @xmath29-component of the magnetic field is destroyed by the reconnection process .",
    "in particular our results show that , while the energy related to the @xmath17-component of the magnetic field is almost constant ( it slightly increases in the @xmath82 case ) , the @xmath83 field energy decreases , and the energy of the @xmath30-component of the magnetic field , which is created during the reconnection process , grows .",

    "the mechanism which leads to the break - up of the frozen - in condition for electrons is analyzed , and the general motion of ions and electrons depending on the guide field is studied .",
    "finally , the mechanism of fast reconnection is studied , when the whistler dynamics are suppressed by the presence of the guide field .",
    "ohm s law in collisionless plasmas states that the reconnection electric field , which is proportional to the reconnection rate , can be expressed as [ e.g. , _ pritchett _ , 2001 ; _ ricci et al .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "8 , where celeste3d and npic results are compared .",
    "when @xmath70 , the ions are accelerated by the reconnection electric field , @xmath90 , at the x point along the @xmath17 direction .",
    "however , the @xmath85 field diverts the electrons , decreasing the @xmath17 velocity , and forcing the outflow in the @xmath29 direction . in the presence of a guide field ,",
    "even far from the x point , the electrons maintain a significant velocity in the @xmath17 direction , as they flow along the magnetic field .",
    "the electron motion is concentrated at the separatrix and the @xmath17 velocity increases with the guide field . celeste3d results [ _ ricci et al _ , 2003 ] reveal also a dependence of the out - of - plane velocity on the mass ratio , showing that lighter electrons reach higher velocities .",
    "this particle acceleration may have important consequences in active galactic nuclei , extragalactic jets , solar flares and auroral arcs [ _ larrabee et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; _ nodes et al .",
    "_ , 2003 and references therein ] .      when @xmath70 , the off - diagonal terms of the electron pressure provide the primary mechanism by which the electrons break the frozen - in condition , and the hall term in ohm s law decouples electron and ion motion and strongly enhances the reconnection rate .",
    "because of the hall effect , the electron and ion motion decouple at a distance of the order of @xmath112 and the whistler dynamics are enabled .",
    "the whistler waves have a quadratic dispersion relation ( @xmath115 ) [ _ biskamp _ , 1997 ] , which allows fast reconnection , even when the diffusion region is small [ _ shay et al . _ ,",
    "the typical signature of the hall effect is the presence of a quadrupolar out - of - plane magnetic field [ _ sonnerup _ , 1979 ; _ terasawa _ , 1983 ] which has also been observed by some satellite observations [ _ ieroset et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ; _ mozer et al .",
    ".    at low @xmath0 , provided that @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) , it has been pointed out that the whistler dynamics are pushed to smaller scales [ _ rogers et al . _ , 2001 ] , because of magnetic field compression , @xmath118 , which remains finite even if the motion is almost incompressible [ _ biskamp _ , 1997 ] . nevertheless , due to the electron pressure term , and in particular the parallel gradient of the electron density , @xmath119 , kaw dynamics arise .",
    "the kaws are characterized by a quadrupole density structure with a scale length @xmath68 , which replaces @xmath112 as the spatial scale of interest in presence of a guide field [ _ kleva et al .",

    "kaws have the same dispersion properties as whistler waves ( @xmath120 ) and enable fast reconnection [ _ biskamp _ , 1997 ] . at still lower @xmath0 ( @xmath121 ) ,",
    "ions and electrons are tightly coupled , ions are forced to follow the electron dynamics , and fast reconnection is not possible [ _ biskamp et al . _ , 1997 ; _ ottaviani and porcelli _ , 1993 ] .",
    "all of our simulations have a plasma @xmath0 that permits fast reconnection .",
    "the mechanism for fast reconnection operative at various @xmath0 have been explored with fluid model [ _ rogers et al .",

    "9 , the out - of - plane magnetic field during the reconnection process is plotted for different mass ratios and different guide fields . in the zero guide field case",
    ", the out - of - plane magnetic field presents the typical quadrupolar symmetric structure due to the hall effect [ _ sonnerup _ , 1979 ; _ terasawa _ , 1983 ] . when a guide field is added to the initial harris sheet equilibrium",
    ", the out - of - plane magnetic field is dramatically altered .",
    "the quadrupolar structure due to the hall effect , is weakened and tilted at @xmath92 , and is unidentifiable for @xmath71 .",
    "even if the pattern of the magnetic field does not depend on the mass ratios , the maximum and minimum values are affected .",
    "the reason for this is the out - of - plane magnetic field depends on the in - plane current which is due to the decoupling of ion and electron motion and the electron motion depends on the mass ratio , influencing the out - of - plane magnetic field .",
    "the width of the ion outflow region is shown in fig . 10 for three different guide fields , by examining the @xmath29-component of the ion velocity , @xmath122 .",
    "it is remarkable that for all guide fields , the ion outflow pattern is not influenced by the mass ratios .",
    "it follows that , at least for the range of guide fields studied , there is a mechanism that decouples the ion and electron dynamics ( the electron dynamics depend on the mass ratio ) . without a guide field ,",
    "the outflow region is of the order of a few @xmath112 . in the presence of the guide field @xmath92 ,",
    "the outflow width decreases , and the outflow region with @xmath43 is narrower than with @xmath92 case ( fig . 10 ) .",
    "we note also that the scale length of interest , @xmath68 , of this regime decreases when the guide field increases .    the electron density pattern in the presence of a guide field is plotted in fig . 11 . the quadrupolar pattern close to the reconnection region is predicted by theory [ _ kleva et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ] , and it is a distinctive feature of the fast reconnection enabled by the kaw physics .",
    "table ii summarizes the variation of the reconnection rates , with the guide field and mass ratio .",
    "the average growth rates are listed .",
    "the reconnection rate decreases as the guide field increases and the fast reconnection mechanism transitions from whistler dynamics to kaw dynamics .",
    "experimental results confirm this trend [ _ yamada et al . _ ,",
    "1997 ] as well as previous numerical results [ _ pritchett _ , 2001 ] .",
    "a scaling law for the reconnection rate has been proposed with this same property [ _ wang et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ] .",
    "_ horiuchi and sato _ [ 1999 ] propose another scaling law for the reconnection rate which shows a decrease of the reconnection rate as the guide field increases and which applies to driven reconnection .",
    "the reconnection rate shows only a weak dependence on the mass ratio .",
    "for @xmath70 , shay and drake [ 1998 ] have demonstrated that the reconnection rate is insensitive to the physics that breaks the frozen - in condition , as a consequence , is insensitive to the electron mass .",
    "this is confirmed by previous kinetic calculations [ _ pritchett _ , 2001 ] and extended to the physical mass ratio by ricci _",
    "[ 2002b ] .",
    "by performing kinetic simulations of harris current sheets with different guide fields and different mass ratios , the physics of magnetic reconnection in plasmas characterized by different @xmath0 values has been studied .",
    "a main result of these simulations is the scaling of the reconnection rate with the guide field and the mass ratio , up to physical values . as in the case of high @xmath0 plasmas , the mechanism which breaks the electron frozen - in condition",
    "is provided by the off - diagonal terms of the electron pressure tensor .",
    "the simulations extend the results to high guide fields , and demonstrate that the scale length of the diffusion region passes form the electron meandering length for @xmath70 to the electron gyroradius in presence of a guide field .",
    "the simulations indicate that the mechanism that allows fast reconnection changes with @xmath0 . for high @xmath0 ,",
    "the typical quadrupolar structure of the out - of - plane magnetic field associated to the whistler dynamics whistler dynamics is present in the simulations .",
    "this mechanism allow the decoupling of electrons and ions . at low @xmath0 ( high guide fields ) ,",
    "the kaw dynamics allows the decoupling and , the quadrupolar electron density pattern which characterize the kaw and which had been predicted theoretically and by fluid models before is revealed by the simulations .",
    "the presence of a guide field causes additional components of the @xmath123 drift , which modify the ion and electron motion causing asymmetric plasma flow .",
    "the comparison between the implicit and the explicit codes has shown a remarkable agreement for phenomena occurring on spatial scales resolved by both codes ( e.g. , the reconnected flux , the structure of the out - of - plane magnetic field , the electron velocity ) .",
    "a phenomenon occurring on spatial scale not resolved by celeste3d , like the mechanism of the electron break - up mechanism , is still present in the implicit code , but its effect has been spread out to a more extended spatial scale .    in closing , we note that an experimental setup has been built to study experimentally the dependence of reconnection on the guide field [ _ furno et al . _ ,",
