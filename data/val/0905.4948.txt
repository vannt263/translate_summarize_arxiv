    "recently , the kyoto group has managed to cool down to quantum degeneracy five ytterbium isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the ytterbium atom has a closed - shell electronic structure in the ground state ( [ xe ] @xmath5f@xmath6 @xmath7s@xmath8",
    "@xmath9s@xmath10 ) , and hence its spin stems _ entirely _ from the nuclear spin , @xmath11 .",
    "the case of the fermionic species @xmath0yb is particularly interesting , as it has nuclear spin @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath13 , and the atom can be in six different internal states . at ultracold temperatures , experiments",
    "show that the scattering length is independent of the atom internal state  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from the absence of electronic spin in the atomic ground state , and the extremely weak dependence of the inter - atomic potential on the atomic nuclear spin .",
    "thus , whereas for a spin-@xmath14 fermion the lee - yang - huang pseudo - potential , depends on three scattering lengths  @xcite , @xmath15 , the previous observation implies that @xmath16 .",
    "mathematically , the interaction part of the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath17\\ : \\delta(\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r}_j ) = \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar^2 a_s}{m } \\sum_{i < j=1}^{n}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r}_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the atom mass and @xmath19 the projector onto the state of total spin @xmath20 for the pair of particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the kinetic and interaction terms have the same symmetry , that is , the initial su@xmath23 spin - symmetry of the hamiltonian describing an ultracold gas of @xmath0yb atoms is enlarged to an effective su@xmath2 symmetry.this is particularly interesting since enlarged symmetries usually lead to additional spectral degeneracies  @xcite , which in turn can lead to exotic ( correlated ) ground states and topological excitations  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of su@xmath2 in an ultracold gas can also lead to new and interesting connections with high - energy physics , where su@xmath2 has been used to describe the flavor symmetry of spinful quarks , as nuclear forces seem to be spin independent to a first approximation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , some of the phases discussed below can be regarded as ( non - relativistic ) pion condensates that spontaneously break su@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , these phases also bear some resemblance to the quantum hall ferromagnets  @xcite discussed in two - dimensional electron gases with valley symmetry ( such as graphene ) .",
    "their possible existence in ultracold gases of @xmath0yb can allow for larger control thanks to the large tunability of these atomic systems . in this",

    "the possibility of spontaneously breaking the su(@xmath27 ) symmetry group in a cascade of phase transitions between different ferromagnetic phases hints at a much richer phase diagram than in the spin-@xmath28 case  @xcite .",

    "indeed , for an su@xmath2 hubbard model at high temperatures , we have computed the density profile showing the mott plateaux ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "finally , a summary of the results as well as a brief discussion of how to detect some of the phases discussed here can be found in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "we begin our analysis of the @xmath0yb system , by exploring some consequences of su@xmath29 for the fermi liquid phase of an interacting gas of @xmath0yb atoms .",
    "although we shall focus on the continuum case , many of there results in this section can be readily applied to the fermi liquid phase of the gas loaded in an optical lattice ( we neglect harmonic confinement for the moment ; it will be considered briefly at the end , and more thoroughly elsewhere  @xcite ) . following landau  @xcite",
    ", we describe the low - lying excited states of the system using the distribution function @xmath30 of a set of elementary excitations called landau quasi - particles ( qp , essentially atoms ` dressed ' by the interactions ) .",
    "the latter are annihilated ( created ) by the fermi operator @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) carrying ( lattice ) momentum @xmath33 and su@xmath4 index @xmath34 .",
    "the excitation free energy of the qp states is given by the landau functional ( summation over repeated greek - indices is implied henceforth ) : @xmath35   \\delta n^{\\alpha}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{p } )   + \\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\sum_{{\\bf p},{\\bf p } ' } f^{\\alpha\\beta}_{\\gamma \\delta}(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{p } ' )   \\delta n^{\\gamma}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{p } ) \\delta n^{\\delta}_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{p}'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the system volume , @xmath37 is the excitation energy of a single landau quasi - particle carrying momentum @xmath33 .",
    "we assume the ground state to be an su@xmath4 singlet and therefore the ground state quasi - particle distribution @xmath38^{\\alpha}_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{p})=   \\theta(\\mu -\\epsilon^{0}(\\mathbf{p}))\\ : \\delta^{\\alpha}_{\\beta}$ ] , where @xmath39 is the chemical potential ; @xmath40^{\\alpha}_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{p})$ ] .",
    "the landau functions @xmath41 describe interactions between quasi - particles .",
    "the expression for @xmath42 can be considerably simplified with the help of group theory by noticing that @xmath43 transforms as a tensor belonging to the _ reducible _ representation of su@xmath4 @xmath44 , where @xmath27 and @xmath45 are the fundamental and its complex conjugate representations , whereas @xmath46 is the singlet and @xmath47 the adjoint representations , respectively .",

    "in addition , since the landau functions transform as tensors belonging to @xmath55 non - singlet representations , all the tensor components are determined by just _ two _ scalar functions ( compared to the five needed for a @xmath56 fermi gas  @xcite ) , that is , @xmath57 .",
    "we next consider the stability of the fermi surface ( fs ) of the su@xmath4 fermi liquid just described above .",
    "for an isotropic fs , general stability conditions against fs deformations and pairing were obtained using the renormalization group by chitov and senechal  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that pairing occurs for attractive interactions .",
    "for repulsive interactions , @xmath58-wave pairing is also possible on a lattice near half - filling , but the pairing temperature rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath27  @xcite . in the case of @xmath0yb ,",
    "s - wave interaction between atoms is naturally repulsive , as the scattering length is @xmath59 nm  @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath60 at the center of the trap in current experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , currently accessible temperatures @xmath61  @xcite are well above any pairing temperature scale .",
    "therefore , the fermi liquid phase should be a good starting description of the system .",
    "however , if the interaction is made sufficiently repulsive , the fermi liquid can become unstable .",
    "the stability of the fs to the so - called pomeranchuk instabilities can be assessed within fermi liquid theory by considering the excitation energy of a quasi - particle distribution describing a deformation of the fs  @xcite . in matrix notation : @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 denotes the matrix whose components are @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the unit matrix , and @xmath66 is a matrix function that describes a small local deformation of the fs ( @xmath67 denotes those @xmath68-points lying on the fs ) . expanding in powers of @xmath69 up to second order , we obtain @xmath70 + \\cdots$ ] and @xmath71 in the continuum or in an optical lattice at low - filling , the fs is isotropic at the locus where @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath74 .",
    "for example , in three dimensions , we can expand @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are the spherical harmonics .",

    "( [ eq : srho ] ) and ( [ eq : sm ] ) , the fs will be unstable if @xmath89 , for @xmath90    the fs instabilities in the density channel ( @xmath91 , that is , @xmath92 ) are formally identical to those occurring in fermi systems with no spin .",
    "they have received much attention recently  @xcite , and lead to phases where the rotation ( or point - group , in the lattice ) symmetry of the fs is broken ( @xmath93 ) . on the other hand , much less attention",
    "has focussed on instabilities in the spin channel , which also break spin symmetry  @xcite , and may occur in the interesting case of the @xmath0yb system with su@xmath29 symmetry .",
    "certainly , the most exotic states will be those resulting from an instability with @xmath94 in the spin channel , or , for a non - isotropic fs , one that breaks the lattice point - group besides su@xmath4 .",
    "the resulting states have a much more complex order parameter , @xmath95 , that is the product of an orbital and an su@xmath4 part ( similar to superfluidity in @xmath96he ) .",
    "however , as ultracold @xmath0yb atoms naturally interact via _ repulsive _ s - wave ( contact ) interactions , in the isotropic case @xmath97 is expected to be the most negative landau parameter , thus favoring su@xmath2 ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "indeed , within hartree - fock theory , @xmath98 whereas @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , where @xmath18 is the atom mass , @xmath101",
    ". hence , the su@xmath4 generalization of stoner s criterion for ferromagnetism , @xmath102 , yields @xmath103 , or equivalently , @xmath104 , in the continuum case .",
    "it is worth noting that this criterion turns out to be the same as for the su@xmath23 case , that is , it is independent of @xmath27 . the independence on @xmath27 of the stoner criterium in a su@xmath4 fermi system can be understood using a simple energetic argument : to create a polarized ground state , imagine for example that @xmath105 fermions are removed from the fermi surface of each of the @xmath106 flavors with @xmath107 and added to the fermi surface of the @xmath108 flavor ( so that the total particle number is unchanged ) . for small @xmath109 , the kinetic energy of the system increases by @xmath110 ^ 2}{2 \\omega n_0(\\mu ) } + \\frac{\\left ( \\delta m_0\\right)^2}{2 \\omega n_0(\\mu ) }   = \\frac{n ( \\delta m_0)^2}{2 ( n-1 ) \\omega n_0(\\mu)}$ ] , whereas the ( hartree - fock ) interaction energy decreases by @xmath111 = - \\frac{n g ( \\delta m_0)^2}{2 ( n-1 ) \\omega}$ ] .",
    "hence , upon comparing both energies , the dependence on @xmath27 drops out and the system becomes unstable provided that @xmath103 , which is independent of @xmath27 and agrees with the result obtained from fermi liquid theory in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the cancellation of the dependence on @xmath27 to the lowest order is a consequence of the fact that both the kinetic and exchage energies scale linearly with @xmath27 ( inspite of the fact that , navely , the interaction scales as @xmath112 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see below , the nature of the transition from a paramagnet to an itinerant ferromagnet turns out to be very different for su@xmath4 with @xmath26 .",
    "the previous analysis using landau fermi liquid theory does not tell us anything about the order of the transition . in the spin-@xmath28 ( su@xmath23 )",
    "case , a landau free - energy functional obtained from the microscopic hamiltonian finds a continuous transition  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been recently pointed out that the coupling of the order parameter fluctuations to soft modes changes the order of the transition from second to first order at low temperatures  @xcite . in order to gain further insights into the nature of the transition at the mean field level",
    ", we shall derive in this section an effective action for the ferromagnetic order parameter starting from the microscopic model . to this end",
    ", we use the following operator identity for the interaction term of the hamiltonian density : @xmath113 ^ 2 : - g \\sum_{r=2}^{n } : \\left [ \\bar{c}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r } )   \\ : ( \\mathbbm{t}^{r^2 - 1})^{\\alpha}_{\\beta}\\ ,   c^{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\right]^2 : \\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath114 stands for operator normal order , that is , the prescription that all atom creation fields , @xmath115 , should stand to the left of the destruction fields , @xmath116 .",

    "however , it should be noticed that the present hubbard - stratonovich decoupling scheme using only the _ diagonal _ generators of su@xmath4 breaks the full su@xmath4 invariance of the theory .",
    "yet , it does reproduce the correct stoner criterion in the mean field ( hartree - fock ) approximation , which , as discussed above , comes out to be independent of @xmath27 .",
    "the su@xmath4 invariance can be recovered by extending the functional integral over the entire set of traceless hermitian matrices @xmath128 transforming according to the adjoint representation of su@xmath4 . as noted in sect .",
    "[ sec : flt ] , a convenient of basis for this set is provided by the generators of the su@xmath4 lie algebra , @xmath49 , with @xmath129 .",

    "this yields the following ( landau ) free - energy per unit volume : @xmath134 the term of @xmath135 vanishes identically because @xmath136 is traceless .",

    ". however , the microscopic approach allows us to relate the coefficients of the expansion to the model parameters .",
    "we next set @xmath147 in ( [ eq : lf ] ) and use the following su@xmath4 identity ( see _ e.g. _",

    "these structure constants are non - zero , which has important implications for the order of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition . in terms of the @xmath153 components of the order parameter ,",

    "thus , the system will exhibit hysteresis , and phase coexistence , with finite surface tension between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase .",
    "furthermore , the entropy will undergo a finite jump across the phase transition from the paramagnet to the su@xmath4 ferromagnet .",
    "moreover , the gas parameter resulting from stoner s criterion @xmath155 , which is the point where the quadratic coefficient vanishes , is actually _ larger _ than the critical value of the gas parameter , that is , @xmath156 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the point where both the paramagnetic minimum ( @xmath157 ) and ferromagnetic minimum ( @xmath158 ) have the same free energy .    to illustrate the general ideas presented above",
    ", we shall next consider the case of the smaller group su@xmath159 , which already contains essential ingredients of su@xmath3 ferromagnetism .",
    "the more complicated case of su@xmath2 relevant to an unpolarized mixture of @xmath0yb atoms will be studied elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "thus , we can choose to write the order parameter @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 , are the generators of the @xmath167 and su@xmath161 lie algebras , and the prime in the summation means that the operator @xmath168 should be excluded . assuming that the su@xmath169 can be broken but the su@xmath161 can not , then @xmath170 .",

    ", we can also obtain the shift in the critical gas parameter ( relative to the stoner value , @xmath179 ) : @xmath180 or @xmath181 at the the mean field level .",
    "fluctuations are likely to decrease the critical value of the gas parameter even further from the stoner value , and may also change the character of the transition ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) . in the su@xmath3 case ,",
    "fluctuations are responsible for the change of the order of the transition for su@xmath23 .",
    "thus , further analysis of the effect of fluctuations is needed but it is beyond the scope of the present work .    for @xmath182 the three energy has one minimum located at @xmath183 . however , for @xmath184 the free energy exhibits tree degenerate minima , corresponding ( in ` cartesian ' @xmath185 coordinates ) to @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "however , it needs to be noticed that these three minima represent the same physical state , as the result of the invariance of the free energy under the transformation @xmath188 , where @xmath189 , which corresponds to a cyclic permutation of the su(3 ) indices @xmath190 , or in other words , to the existence of three ( non - commuting ) su@xmath23 subalgebras in su@xmath159 , into which the larger group @xmath191 can be spontaneously broken .",
    "thus , let us choose @xmath192 ( corresponding to @xmath193 and @xmath194 ) , where @xmath195 .",
    "this ferromagnetic state corresponds to a gas where one of the species fermi surface ( @xmath196 , in this case ) grows at the expense of the two others , which remain degenerate .",
    "this state left invariant under the transformations generated by the su@xmath23 subalgebra span by @xmath197 .",
    "furthermore , it is left invariant by the u@xmath198 transformations generated by @xmath199 .",

    "if the interaction is increased further on , the remaining su@xmath23 group may be also spontaneously broken down to u@xmath198 in a subsequent transition .",
    "generally speaking , unlike su@xmath23 case , the su@xmath4 may be spontaneously broken in a cascade of phase transitions .",
    "a general analysis of the possibilities can be given by considering the structure of the order parameter .",
    "as pointed out above , the order parameter is a traceless hermitian matrix , @xmath201 , which transforms according to the adjoint representation of su@xmath4 .",

    "a simple example of the broken symmetry ground states ( at the hartree - fock level ) is provided by the state @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the particle vacuum .",
    "the number of different eigenvalues tell us how many of the fermi momenta coincide .",
    "more generally , any fm ground state can be considered to be adiabatically connected with an su@xmath4 rotation of @xmath209 . when there are only two different eigenvalues , the order parameter manifold @xmath210 $ ] , that is , a grassmanian manifold  @xcite . in particular , for @xmath211 , @xmath212 , the complex projective space .",
    "these manifolds have non - trivial second homotopy group , @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) , which implies that these fm phases can sustain topologically stable excitations that are skyrmions in @xmath215 and monopoles in @xmath216 . furthermore , when su@xmath4 breaks into a subgroup containing more than one @xmath217 , @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the total number of @xmath217 s .",
    "the corresponding phases thus support complex types of topological defects described by several ( integer ) topological charges    finally , let us mention that as far as the experimental realization of su@xmath3 ferromagnetism is concerned , the above discussion suggest that the most convenient approach to observe an su@xmath3 paramagnet to ferromagnet phase transition in the @xmath0yb system is to increase the scattering length by means of an optical feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism may also appear when the system is loaded in an optical lattice .",
    "however , this phase will compete with others ( see next section ) and further analysis will be required to understand the full phase diagram of the lattice system .",
    "when the system is loaded in an optical lattice other phases may become more energetically favorable . in a uniformly filled lattice , as the filling @xmath220 ( @xmath221 and @xmath222 being the total atom and site numbers , respectively ) approaches half - filling , @xmath223 other phases can become more favorable than ferromagnetism .",

    "this model will be accurate when the lattice is sufficiently deep .",
    "if the lattice depth is further increased so that hopping is suppressed along one direction , the system dimensionality will become effectively @xmath215 . in this case",
    ", there is strong evidence that for large values of @xmath27  @xcite , a staggered flux phase  @xcite with atom currents circulating in opposite directions in neighboring plaquettes will be favored as the ground state .",
    "this phase breaks time - reversal as well as lattice translation symmetries but does not break su@xmath4 : thus the system will exhibit long - range order also at finite temperatures in @xmath215 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that @xmath228 is indeed a borderline case where this phase competes with a flavor density wave that breaks both lattice translation symmetry and su@xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the order parameter of this phase , @xmath229 ( where @xmath230 at half - filling ) , is also a tensor belonging to the adjoint representaiton .",

    "thus , the @xmath0yb gas in an optical lattice may be an ideal system to study the rich phase diagram resulting from the competition of all these phases .    however , the temperatures that are currently achievable in an optical lattice ( typically larger than the hopping amplitude @xmath233 , see caption on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) are well above the temperature scales where the ordered phases discussed above may occur .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the harmonic trap leads to an _ inhomogeneous _ filling of the lattice .",
    "the variation of the site occupation across the trap can be estimated in the so - called atomic ( _ i.e. _ @xmath234 ) limit of the su@xmath4 hubbard model introduced above upon including the harmonic trap : @xmath235 ^ 2   +   v_\\mathrm{t } \\sum_{\\mathbf{r } }    \\left ( \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{a_0 } \\right)^2 \\rho({\\mathbf{r}})$ ] , where @xmath236 is the trapping energy and @xmath226 the ( optical ) lattice parameter . the average site occupation can be thus obtained from @xmath237/\\mathrm{tr } e^{-(h_{\\mathrm{at } } - \\mu n)/t } $ ] , with @xmath238 and @xmath120 the absolute temperature .",
    "hence , @xmath239,\\ ] ] where @xmath240 is the energy degeneracy of a single - site state containing @xmath241 particles .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath39 must be adjusted to fix the total number of particles and @xmath120 must be such that the entropy of the lattice equals that of the gas before _",
    "adiabatically _ ramping up the lattice . a plot of the site occupancy as a function of the radial distance to the center of the trap @xmath242 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "to sum up , by using fermi liquid theory , we have discussed fermi liquid ( pomeranchuk ) instabilities in the spin chanel of a strongly interacting ultracold @xmath0yb gas exhibiting an enlarged su@xmath25 symmetry . focusing on the ferromagnetic instability , which does not break space rotation or translation symmetries , we have shown that the transition is generically first order ( at least , at the mean level ) .",
    "such an instability corresponds to a phase transition which can observed by increasing the scattering length using an optical feshbach resonance or / and in an optical lattice . for the continuum case",
    ", the first order of the transition implies that the transition takes places at a slightly smaller value of the scattering length than the value provided by the stoner criterion , which we find to be independent of the order of the group , @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , using the smaller group su@xmath159 as an example , we have illustrated how the larger unitary symmetry is broken by an explicitly analysis of the landau free energy derived from the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we found that su@xmath159 is spontaneously broken down to su@xmath243 u@xmath198 .    on general symmetry grounds",
    ", we can expect a number of symmetry - breaking patterns for su@xmath2 , which may be the result of not just one but a cascade of phase transitions between ferromagnetic phases .",
    "these su@xmath4 ferromagnets system can sustain exotic topologically stable excitations , such as skyrmions in @xmath215 and monopoles in @xmath216",
    ". the resulting phase diagram may be indeed quite rich , and will be explored elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "an interesting direction would be also to apply the analysis , based on hertz theory  @xcite , to study other fermi surface instabilities in su@xmath4 spin channel or to the flavor density wave of ref .",
    "@xcite on the lattice . based on the group theoretic properties of the order parameter",
    ", the latter may also turn out to be first order at the mean field level . furthermore , in the optical lattice , the @xmath0yb system also offers other possibilites .",
    "such a realization of the staggered flux phase , which breaks the lattice but not su@xmath4 symmetry .",
    "however , under current experimental conditions , the temperature of the gas in the lattice is well above the ordering temperature for these phases . in this limit",
    ", we have obtained the density profile in a harmonic trap ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the spin of the ytterbium atom in its ground state is entirely nuclear implies that its coupling to a real magnetic field is very weak and this renders magnetic fields impractical to detect the population of different species .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic phases and the topological defects discussed above could be detected by means of the optical stern - gerlach effect induced by off - resonant circularly polarized light  @xcite .",
    "although this method has not been yet demonstrated experimentally , it provides the most direct way to image the population of each species in a single shot measurement  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that the possibilities discussed above for the observation of new and exotic many - body states in the @xmath0yb will spur further theoretical and experimental research along these lines .",
    "the first step in this direction may be measuring the site occupation in an optical lattice , which can be carried out as explained in ref .  .",
