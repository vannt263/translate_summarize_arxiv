    "the basic , universal quantities which describe the inclusive cross - sections of hard processes within the qcd improved parton model are the scale dependent parton distributions .",
    "these distributions depend upon the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 and the hard scale @xmath5 and correspond to the integrals over transverse momentum @xmath6 of the so called _ unintegrated _ distributions describing the ( scale dependent ) @xmath0 and @xmath6 parton distributions .",
    "the unintegrated distributions are needed in the description of less inclusive quantities which are sensitive to the transverse momenta of the partons @xcite - @xcite .",
    "+ the unintegrated parton distributions are described in perturbative qcd by the catani , ciafaloni , fiorani , marchesini ( ccfm ) equation @xcite which is based on color coherence which implies angular ordering .",
    "it embodies in a unified way the ( lo ) altarelli - parisi evolution at large and moderately small values of @xmath0 with the bfkl dynamics at small @xmath0 .",
    "+ the ccfm equation which was originally formulated for unpolarized parton densities has recently been generalized to spin dependent unintegrated parton distributions @xcite .",
    "novel feature of the spin dependent case is its different structure at small @xmath0 and in particular the absence of the non - eikonal ( or non - sudakov ) form - factors .",
    "we include here also the ( spin dependent ) quark distributions , leading first to a system of ccfm equations for unintegrated spin dependent quark and gluon distributions .",
    "we shall then extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite along the following lines :    1",
    ".   we shall incorporate theoretical qcd expectations concerning the double logarithmic small @xmath0 effects .",
    "we observe in particular that both the angular ordering constraint and the kernels of the corresponding system of the ccfm equations have to be appropriately modified .",
    "2 .   we shall include complete splitting functions @xmath7 and not only their singular and finite parts in the limit @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "3 .   we shall explore the relative simplicity of the system of the modified polarized ccfm equations due to absence of non - eikonal form - factors and utilize the transverse coordinate representation of those equations .",
    "the transverse coordinate @xmath10 is related to the transverse momentum of the partons through the fourier - bessel transformation and the system of the ccfm equation can be partially diagonalized by this transformation .",
    "the content of our paper is as follows : in the next section we recall the original formulation of the ccfm equation developed in @xcite and include the polarized quark distributions , while in sections 3 and 4 we formulate the modifications of the ccfm framework , which will incorporate the qcd expectations concerning the double @xmath1 resummation at low @xmath0 and the complete altarelli - parisi evolution of integrated densities in moderately small and large values of @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that the modifed ccfm equations , including their extension discussed in sections 4 and 5 can be partially diagonalized by the fourier - bessel transformation .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the modified ccfm equations and for simplicity we limit ourselves to the non - singlet quark distributions .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize our main results and give our conclusions .",
    "along the lines of @xcite@xcite@xcite a version of the ccfm equation has been derived for the longitudinally polarized gluon distribution @xcite . for the corresponding expressions including quarks",
    "one has to take into consideration that the soft emission occurs predominantly from a ladder of gluons because of their larger spin quantum number .",
    "therefore , quarks appear only as initial states playing automatically the role of the hardest emission which enters in the altarelli parisi splitting function , see fig .",
    "[ quarks ] .",
    "therefore , the arguments presented in @xcite are valid in the case of quarks as well .",
    "the polarization does not enter into the soft emission .",
    "consequently , again a non - eikonal form factor is absent and the eikonal form factor is identical to the one in the unpolarized case .",
    "furthermore , in its original formulation the ccfm equation is an evolution equation valid only in the limits @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and therefore , the altarelli parisi kernels enter only in interpolated form , taking the limits @xmath13 and @xmath14 into account .",
    "the complete polarized ccfm equations take the following general form : @xmath15 here we have used : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the unintegrated polarized gluon distribution function , @xmath18 the unintegrated polarized singlet quark parton distribution function and @xmath19 denotes any polarized non - singlet combination of the quark parton distribution functions like the triplet @xmath20 and the octet contribution ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "for the convolution one has the structure : @xmath22 using @xmath23 . in terms of the principles discussed above",
    "one obtains for the ccfm splitting kernels : @xmath24 the eikonal form factors have the form : @xmath25 and the interpolating altarelli - parisi kernels read then ( c.  f.  @xcite ) : @xmath26   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it may easily be observed that the angular ordering constraint which is embodied within the ccfm equation generates the double @xmath1 terms for the integrated parton distributions . the result concerning",
    "resummation of those terms turns out to be , however , different from the qcd expectations discussed in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the double @xmath2 effects in qcd are generated by the ladder and non - ladder bremsstrahlung diagrams .",
    "+ in order to get the expected double logarithmic limit of the integrated distributions corresponding to the ladder diagrams contribution it is sufficient to replace the angular ordering constraint @xmath30 by the stronger constraint @xmath31 in the corresponding evolution equations for _ integrated _ distributions .",
    "the latter just correspond to the fourier transformed unintegrated evolution equations at @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that this replacement can be done for arbitrary values of the transverse coordinate @xmath10 . due to this replacement",
    "we will obtain an equation which incorporates the known collinear ( lo altarelli - parisi ) evolution for a not too small @xmath0 and the double logarithmic asymptotics for @xmath33 .",

    "having this point in mind we will henceforward call the evolution equation for the polarized unintegrated parton distributions which we derive starting from the ccfm formulation and where we are including our modfications a modified polarized ccfm evolution equation . apart from this substitution in the argument of the theta function to include the double logarithmic contributions , we shall also make the following modifications of the original ccfm equations proposed in @xcite :    1 .",

    "a possible diagonalization of the problem from a mathematical point of view would be the transformation of the pccfm equation ( here using the weaker constraint @xmath120 ) into mellin space : @xmath121 unfortunately , it turns out that the back transformation after evolution , especially as regards the small-@xmath0 region , is numerically quite problematic .",
    "therefore , we take a different approach here , where both the @xmath122 and the @xmath0 dependence is expanded into properly chosen chebyshev polynomials . these are defined in the following way : @xmath123 the generic advantage of the chebyshev polynomials is now that there exists also a discrete orthogonality relation .",
