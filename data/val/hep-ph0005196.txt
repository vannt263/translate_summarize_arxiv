    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is a theoretically attractive extension of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "supersymmetric theories can solve the higgs hierarchy puzzle @xcite , break electroweak symmetry radiatively at low energies @xcite , and explain the unification of the gauge couplings at a high energy scale @xcite .",
    "susy introduces a superpartner for each standard model particle with the same quantum numbers , but for a difference in spin of 1/2 .",
    "if supersymmetry were exact , these superparticles would be degenerate in mass with their standard model partners .",
    "however , susy can be broken softly in such a way that its attractive features survive , while the superpartners become heavy enough to evade current limits from collider searches @xcite .",
    "a powerful and general parametrization for the soft susy - breaking terms is provided by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "soft breaking mechanisms require that the superpartners remain lighter than a few tev , and thus there is reason to expect that high energy investigations , such as those at lep ii , run ii of the fermilab tevatron , and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will discover supersymmetric particles or place strong constraints on supersymmetric models .",
    "the search for direct experimental evidence of supersymmetry at colliders requires a good understanding of theoretical predictions of the cross sections for production of the superparticles . in the case of hadron colliders , where collisions of strongly interacting hadrons are studied",
    ", the large strong coupling strength ( @xmath3 ) leads to potentially large contributions beyond the leading order ( lo ) in a perturbation series expansion of the cross section . to have accurate theoretical estimates of production rates and differential cross sections , it is necessary to include corrections at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) or beyond .",
    "next - to - leading order calculations of the hadroproduction of gluinos and squarks @xcite , top squarks @xcite , sleptons @xcite , and gauginos @xcite have been published , including our brief report on associated production of gauginos and gluinos @xcite . in this paper , we provide a detailed exposition of our calculation of associated production , and we present new predictions of total and differential cross sections for a variety of assumptions about the superpartner mass spectrum .    associated production of a gaugino ( @xmath4 ) with a gluino ( @xmath2 ) or with a squark ( @xmath5 ) is potentially a very important production mechanism .",
    "associated production processes are semi - weak in that they involve one somewhat smaller coupling constant than the production of a pair of colored sparticles .",
    "however , in popular models of susy breaking  @xcite , the mass spectrum favors much lighter masses for the color - neutral , low - lying neutralinos and charginos than for the colored squarks and gluinos .",
    "their lighter mass means that the phase space for production of neutralinos and charginos , and the relevant partonic luminosities , will be greater than that for gluinos and squarks .",
    "this effect is potentially decisive at a collider with limited energy , such as the tevatron .",
    "indeed , as our numerical results show , the extra phase space may more than offset the smaller coupling , and gauginos may be produced more copiously than squarks at the tevatron .",
    "another point in favor of associated production is the relative simplicity of the final state .",
    "for example , the lowest lying neutralino is the ( stable ) lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supergravity ( sugra ) models  @xcite , manifest only as missing energy in the events , and it is the second lightest in gauge - mediated models@xcite .",
    "the charginos and higher mass neutralinos may decay leptonically leaving a lepton signature plus missing transverse energy ; relatively clean events ensue .",
    "furthermore , associated production may be the best channel for measurement of the gluino mass @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present our complete nlo calculation in susy - qcd of the hadroproduction of a gluino in association with a gaugino , including contributions from virtual loops of colored sparticles and particles , and three - particle final states in which light quarks or gluons are emitted .",
    "we extract the ultraviolet , infrared , and collinear divergences by use of dimensional regularization and illustrate how they may be absorbed by the usual renormalization and mass factorization procedures . in computing the virtual contributions , we encountered divergent four - point functions that had not been evaluated previously .",
    "we use a combined analytic and numerical phase space slicing method to treat the contributions from real emission of light particles .",
    "associated production was calculated at lo some years ago @xcite .",
    "our reason to focus first on the @xmath4 plus @xmath2 final state , rather than the @xmath4 plus @xmath5 final state , is that the lo cross sections for @xmath6 are 3 to 6 times greater than those for @xmath7 at the energy of the tevatron when the mass @xmath8 gev , and 6 to 15 times greater when @xmath9 gev .",
    "these comparisons are pertinent for the lighter mass neutralinos @xmath10 and chargino @xmath11 . in obtaining the @xmath5 cross sections , we sum over five flavors of degenerate squarks and antisquarks .",
    "our analysis is general in that it is not tied to a particular susy breaking model .",
    "we can provide cross sections for arbitrary gluino and gaugino masses , and , indeed , the values of the cross sections at tevatron and lhc energies depend crucially on the sparticle masses .",
    "mass generation in supersymmetry is accomplished in a hidden sector and transmitted to the mssm fields . in sugra models",
    "@xcite , transmission is through gravitational interactions , while in gauge - mediated  @xcite and gaugino - mediated  @xcite models , it occurs through gauge interactions .",
    "anomaly mediated susy breaking , also gravitational in origin , is a fourth possibility @xcite . in the presentation of predictions for cross sections ,",
    "we consider illustrative mass spectra typical of each scenario and consistent with bounds established from current data  @xcite .",
    "we also examine the phenomenologically open case of a gluino with mass light compared to the susy scale , @xmath12 gev .",
    "this possibility arises in some models of gauge - mediated susy breaking @xcite .    as is shown in detail below , the nlo corrections to associated production are generally positive , but they can be modest in size , ranging in the sugra model from a few percent at the energy of the fermilab tevatron to 100% at the energy of the lhc , depending on the sparticle masses .",
    "in the light - gluino case , nlo contributions increase the cross section by factors of 1.3 to 1.4 at the energy of the tevatron and by factors of 2 to 3.5 at the energy of the lhc . owing to these enhancements , collider searches for signatures of associated production will generally discover or exclude sparticles with masses larger than one would estimate based on lo production rates alone .",
    "more significant from the viewpoint of reliability , the renormalization and factorization scale dependence of the cross sections is reduced by a factor of more than two when nlo contributions are included .    at run ii of the fermilab tevatron , for an integrated luminosity of 2 @xmath13",
    ", we expect that 10 or more events could be produced in each of the lighter gaugino channels of the sugra model , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , provided that the gluino mass @xmath17 is less than 450 gev .",
    "the cross sections for the three heavier gaugino channels , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , are smaller by an order of magnitude or more than those of the lighter gaugino channels . in the light gluino model that we consider , more",
    "than 100 events could be produced in the three lighter gaugino channels provided that the common gut - scale fermion mass @xmath21 is less than 400 gev , and as many as 10 events in the three heavier gaugino channels as long as @xmath21 is less than 200 gev . at the higher energy and luminosity of the lhc ,",
    "at least a few events should be produced in every channel in the sugra model and many more in the light gluino model .",
    "the shapes of the rapidity distributions of the gauginos are not altered appreciably by nlo contributions , but the locations of the maximum cross section in transverse momentum ( @xmath22 ) are shifted to smaller values by nlo contributions . at lhc energies where the contribution of the @xmath23 initial state is important , modifications of the @xmath22 spectra can be pronounced .",
    "we begin in sec .  [ leading ] with a brief review of the lo calculation in order to introduce our notation . in this section",
    ", we also introduce the susy breaking models we adopt and summarize salient aspects of their predicted mass spectra .",

    "we assume that there is no mixing between squarks of different generations and that the squark mass eigenstates are aligned with the squark chirality states , equivalent to the assumption that the two squarks of a given flavor are degenerate in mass .",
    "we ignore the @xmath26 light quark masses in all of the kinematics and couplings , and thus study the production of gaugino - like charginos and neutralinos , but not the production of higgsino - like ones @xcite .",
    "we assume further that the entries in the chargino and neutralino mass matrices are real , and thus that the unitary transformations from the ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) bases to the ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) bases are given by orthogonal matrices .",
