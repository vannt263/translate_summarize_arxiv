    "recent numerical studies @xcite have provided strong evidence that @xmath1-symmetric , vacuum spacetimes on @xmath4 generically develop mixmaster - like , oscillatory singularities of the type predicted long ago by belinskii , khalatnikov and lifschitz ( bkl ) @xcite .",
    "these results confirm numerically some of the most surprising features of the bkl prediction , namely that nearby spatial points are effectively decoupled in their asymptotic metric evolution and that the metric variables at each of these points evolve , at least qualitatively , like those of a mixmaster spacetime .",
    "several years ago b. grubii ' c and one of us ( v.m . )",
    "@xcite made an analytical effort to generate some exact vacuum spacetimes which were spatially inhomogeneous and which were expected to exhibit the sort of oscillatory singularities which have since been seen in the numerical studies @xcite .",
    "that effort was not completed at the time since it was not realized that several seemingly intractable integrals actually cancel in the course of the calculations leaving only elementary computations to be done .",
    "we shall therefore complete that project here and use the results to compare , in a more quantitative way , the numerical results with some exact oscillatory singularities .    to generate new solutions having mixmaster - like oscillations , we begin with the actual mixmaster solutions and apply a standard solution generating technique .",
    "we choose one of the killing fields shared by the mixmaster family and treat it as the generator of a spacelike @xmath1 action on @xmath5 , ignoring the presence of the other killing symmetries .",
    "we compute the twist potential associated with the chosen killing field and reexpress the field equations , in a well - known way @xcite , as a kaluza - klein reduced system on the base manifold @xmath6 of the @xmath7-bundle @xmath8 .",
    "the field equations on the base take the form of @xmath9 einstein gravity coupled to a wave map whose target space is the hyperbolic plane , @xmath10 .",
    "the isometry group of this latter space , @xmath11 , acts on the base fields in a natural way so as to transform the given solution to a family of potentially inequivalent solutions .    by a careful choice of the applied group element",
    "one can arrange that the transformed solution either lifts to the same bundle defined for the original spacetime or perhaps to a different one ( e.g. , the trivial bundle,@xmath12 , or a `` squashed sphere '' , @xmath13 ) .",
    "typically , the new solutions will preserve only the killing field that generates the common @xmath1 action and not preserve those killing fields of the seed solutions which fail to commute with the chosen @xmath1 generator .",
    "thus the new solutions are expected to be spatially inhomogeneous and yet to exhibit mixmaster - like oscillations inasmuch as their metrics are parametrized by the same functions appearing in the mixmaster seed metrics themselves .",
    "a previous application of this technique involved transforming an infinite dimensional family of `` generalized taub - nut '' spacetimes defined on @xmath5 , which have smooth cauchy horizons at their `` singular '' boundaries , to a new family of curvature singular spacetimes defined on @xmath14 @xcite . because of the special nature of the seed solutions in this case , the transformed solutions developed only velocity dominated singularities and never exhibited mixmaster - like oscillations .",
    "a new technique based upon expressing the einstein evolution equations in a so - called fuchsian form seems capable of significantly enlarging this set of rigorous , @xmath1-symmetric , curvature singular cosmological spacetimes but , so far , is also only capable of yielding velocity dominated singularities @xcite .",
    "so far as we know the solutions presented for the first time here are the only known exact inhomogeneous vacuum spacetimes which exhibit mixmaster oscillations .",
    "though only a finite dimensional family they presumably display behavior representative of more general , @xmath1-symmetric vacuum spacetimes and thus warrant comparison with numerically produced @xmath1-solutions .",
    "making such a comparison is the second main aim , after producing the solutions themselves , of this paper . as a byproduct of this work",
    ", we also resolve a potential paradox that was pointed out in ref .",
    "there it was shown that every @xmath1-symmetric vacuum spacetime admits a certain gauge invariant conserved quantity which is expressible purely locally in terms of the instantaneous cauchy data for that solution and serves as a casimir invariant for the @xmath11 action . for generic @xmath1 solutions",
    "this quantity is known to be non - trivial but , if non - trivial for the mixmaster subfamily , would seem to contradict the anticipated `` chaos '' of the mixmaster dynamics @xcite . the only sensible resolution , as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the quantity actually vanishes on the mixmaster subfamily .",
    "this we find to be the case by explicit calculation .",
    "the inhomogeneity in our transformed solutions is produced , roughly speaking , by the fact that we choose to reduce with respect to a killing field which fails to commute with the remaining killing fields of the seed metric .",
    "this is unavoidable with the generic mixmaster solution but special cases such as the taub - nut metrics allow for different possibilities .",
    "the additional killing field admitted by taub space commutes with all the generators and is preserved upon reduction with respect to one of these ( non - abelian ) generators .",
    "the resulting spacetime has therefore ( at least ) two commuting killing fields and is thus a special case of the so - called gowdy family of spacetimes .",
    "by contrast one could instead choose to reduce with respect to the additional , commutative killling field but , in this case , all the symmetries are preserved and one arrives , as was first shown by geroch @xcite , at only the kantowski - sachs ( i.,e .",
    "locally interior schwarzschild ) spacetime .",
    "one might wonder if the `` new '' solutions we produce are really inhomogeneous at all or perhaps because of their expression in an unusual gauge , are merely homogeneous solutions in disguise .",
    "we shall use the gowdy transform of taub space mentioned above , to show that this is not the case ",
    "the new solutions are not in general globally homogeneous .",
    "the mixmaster spacetimes are spatially homogeneous vacuum metrics on @xmath5 whose line elements can be written @xmath15 here the @xmath16 are a global , analytic basis of one - forms on @xmath17 expressible in terms of the usual euler angle coordinates @xmath18 by @xmath19 these forms , and therefore the above line element , are invariant with respect to the @xmath1 action on @xmath17 generated by the killing field @xmath20 whose orbits yield a hopf fibration of @xmath17 , i.e. make @xmath17 into a principal fiber bundle over @xmath21 with bundle projection given by @xmath22    of course the mixmaster metrics are invariant with respect to a full @xmath23 action generated by killing fields @xmath24 but , for the transformations we shall consider , only invariance with respect to @xmath20 will in general be preserved",

    "we now rewrite the line element in the @xmath1-symmetric form developed in refs .",

    "taking @xmath31 and noting that the shift vector vanishes we express @xmath32 in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scalar field @xmath35 given explicitly by @xmath36 since @xmath37 is invariant with respect to the @xmath1 action generated by @xmath20 it induces a function on the quotient manifold @xmath38 which ( with a slight abuse of notation ) we shall also designate by @xmath37 . in a similar way one finds induced upon the quotient manifold @xmath6 a lorentzian metric @xmath39 and a one - form field @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "these forms are slightly specialized because of the vanishing of the shift vector field in @xmath32 .",

    "taking into account the equation @xmath56 satisfied by @xmath70 and the fact that @xmath6 admits no non - trivial harmonic one forms , we now introduce the `` twist potential '' function @xmath71 ( a salar field on @xmath72 ) by imposing @xmath73 these equations are self consistent and yield the solution @xmath74 which is unique up to the additive constant @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the function defined by @xmath77 as discussed in refs .",

    "we then show that the transformed spatial metric @xmath132 is not homogeneous as it would have to be for the resulting spacetime to have this property .",
    "the key point here is the fact that on any compact slice , having constant mean curvature the first and second fundamental forms @xmath133 would both have to be homogeneous in order that the spacetime have this property .",

    "indeed , the only vacuum homogeneous solution on @xmath144 is known to be the kantowski - sachs universe which does not have a hypersurface of time symmetry .",
    "it is possible to get the kantowski - sachs metric upon transformation of a taub metric ( i.e. , a mixmaster solution having @xmath145 ) but to do so one must reduce with respect to the `` extra '' killing field the taub metric possesses , @xmath146 , rather than with respect to the common killing field @xmath147 of the mixmaster family as we have done . the extra killing field",
    "@xmath146 commutes with all the killing symmetries of the taub solution and allows all of these symmetries to be preserved upon reduction @xcite .",
    "the taub metric used in the example above , is known explicitly but exhibits no @xmath148 type oscillations . to see such oscillations in an inhomogeneous setting , we combine a previously developed code for solving the mixmaster equations of motion with the transformations discussed above .",
    "our results are discussed in the following section and compared with results derived from a general @xmath1-syummetric , vacuum einstein code .",
    "elsewhere we have shown that even the homogeneous mixmaster model reproduces the local behavior seen in generic @xmath1-symmetric cosmologies @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , it is clear that @xmath37 is dominated by the largest of the mixmaster scale factors @xmath149 , @xmath150 , or @xmath151 .",
    "the local oscillations seen in @xmath37 in the @xmath1-symmetric models are interpreted as follows : assume that the bkl approximate description of a homogeneous mixmaster model as a sequence of kasner epochs is valid",
    ". in a given approximate kasner epoch assume @xmath152 and that @xmath149 is increasing .",
    "then @xmath153 for @xmath154 while @xmath155 and @xmath156 are less than zero .",
    "the usual mixmaster bounce changes the sign of @xmath157 and thus of @xmath158 .",
    "however , after the bounce , either @xmath155 ( within an era ) or @xmath156 ( at the end of an era ) becomes positive .",
    "when the growing scale factor surpasses the decreasing @xmath149 , @xmath158 will start to grow again since it will now track the new dominant scale factor .",
    "a similar analysis indicates that the remaining `` dynamical '' variables , @xmath71 , @xmath159 , and @xmath63 , depend on an order unity ratio of scale factors and thus do not oscillate , as @xmath37 does , between order unity and exponentially small values .",
    "( here we shall use `` order unity '' to mean some finite value which is not exponentially small . )    in our previous numerical simulations of generic @xmath1-symmetric cosmologies on @xmath160 , we noted that the oscillations in @xmath37 could be interpreted as bounces off the potentials @xmath161 and @xmath162 . for a mixmaster solution , @xmath163 is exponentially small unless @xmath164 is of order unity while @xmath165 is exponentially small unless the two largest scale factors are approximately equal to each other @xcite .",
    "this is clearly consistent with a presumption that the generic models exhibit local mixmaster dynamics .    to explore the nature of the new inhomogeneous @xmath1-symmetric models , we note that the transformed variables @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 will remain of order unity ( i.e. they will not oscillate between exponentially small and order unity values ) because the right hand sides of eqs .",

    "this code is known to solve the mixmaster ode s with machine - level precision and can follow hundreds of bounces .",
