    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are binary systems consisting of a compact object orbiting a massive companion star .",
    "prior to the launch of the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( _ integral _ ) in 2002 , most of the known hmxbs contained a be companion . in be - type hmxbs ,",
    "the compact object emits strong x - ray flashes when it crosses the equatorial plane of the companion star , where a thick disk of matter originating from the stellar wind is present .",
    "o and b - type stars have more isotropic stellar winds which absorb the x - ray emission of the compact object , rendering them almost undetectable below a few kev . since the launch of _ integral _ , however , many such systems have been found ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , raising the ratio of be - hmxbs to o , b - hmxbs close to 0.5 .",
    "the study of this new population may have strong implications on the scenarios of binary formation and evolution . in this perspective",
    ", the use of x - ray spectroscopy at different orbital phases makes it possible to probe the stellar wind , providing two - dimensional information on the density and ionization structure of the wind .",
    "for instance , the soft excess that is present in the soft x - ray spectra of many hmxbs , whose origin is still quite mysterious , is linked to the physics of the wind close to the compact object , especially the region where the fast moving stellar wind collides with the slow moving and highly ionized gas surrounding the compact object @xcite .",
    "igr  j19140@xmath00951  was discovered by _ integral _  by the satellite _ integral _  in march 2003 @xcite .",
    "prior to our study , it was identified an a hmxb with an orbital period of 13.552 days @xcite , composed probably of a neutron star @xcite orbiting a b0.5 i type supergiant companion star @xcite .",
    "thus , it is a good candidate to study the properties of the obscured x - ray binaries .",
    "the data from the two satellites were reduced using the latest software packages available . since igr",
    "j19140@xmath00951  is a fairly faint source , we also corrected the spectra for the galactic x - ray background ( gxb ) , using the parameters measured by @xcite .",
    "this correction aimed mostly at minimising the errors on the measure of the photoelectric absorption , by removing the galactic contribution and keeping only the absorption intrinsic to the source .",
    "we identified the emission process as thermal comptonization , which is quite common for this type of source . but",
    "a more interesting characteristic is the detection of a so called `` soft excess '' .    during our study , some spectra exhibited an excess in the soft x - ray part of the spectra , which we modeled by adding a black body component to the model .",
    "this feature has already been observed in many x - ray binaries ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "its origin is mysterious , but can be linked to the immediate environment of the neutron star , and explained qualitatively by the following scenario . due to its high energy emission , the neutron star ionizes the surrounding material . since the stellar wind is accelerated by ionization in the uv lines , the already ionized gas around the neutron star is no longer accelerated by the stellar radiation field .",
    "when the compact object moves along its orbit , the hot gas will gradually be overtaken by the stellar wind .",
    "this will lead to the formation of a  tail \" trailing the neutron star .    as the gas in this tail is ionized , its absorption will be lower , but its precise effect on the emission is not clear .",
    "since the soft excess is only visible just prior the superior conjunction ( between phases 0.25 and 0.5 ) , one possibility is that the hard x - ray emission may be scattered around the tail .",
    "the precise study of this effect , however , would require better spectral resolution in the soft x - ray range than what is available on _",
    "in order to constrain several parameters for the system , we used a simple wind model based of the fact that b - type stars emit strong stellar winds , usually taken to be stationary and spherically symmetric .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a precise description of the method",
    ". using the evolution of the photoelectric absorption , we were able to constrain the inclination of the system and the mass - loss rate of the companion star .",
    "for the most probable stellar radius of 21 @xmath4 , the lower inclination limit is constrained between 37 and 42 degrees ( fig .",
    "[ meilleur ] , left ) , with @xmath5 being at a minimum in the range 5563 degrees .",
    "[ meilleur ] , right , shows the best - fit model against the experimental normalised data , with a good agreement .",

    "the study of x - ray binaries is challenging since it is often difficult if not impossible to identify their visible and infrared counterparts .",
    "even if an infrared counterpart were observed , the distance to some systems prohibits the measurement of the orbital characteristics .",
    "our study shows that x - ray observations can overcome these limitations and produce very precise inferences .",
    "the _ rxte _  and",
    "_ integral _  observations of igr  j19140@xmath00951  have led to good measurements of the orbital period of the system and constraints on its inclination angle .    moreover",

    "j19140@xmath00951 , we diagnosed the type of the companion ( supergiant o or b ) , the wind density and its structure around the neutron star .",
    "more precise observations could lead to constraints on the mass and radius of the companion , and better constraints on the stellar wind .",
    "this allows the study of new _ integral _",
    "sources , either distant or highly absorbed , and ultimately the determination of new useful data for x - ray binary evolution scenarios ."
