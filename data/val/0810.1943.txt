    "integrability has proven a valuable concept for the analysis and solution of nonlinear field theories in 1 + 1 dimensions , but its generalization to higher dimensions is a rather difficult endeavour , and a generally accepted concept of higher - dimensional integrability does not yet exist .",
    "one possible way to generalize integrability to higher dimensions was proposed in @xcite , where the zero curvature of zakharov and shabat has been generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "further , it was demonstrated in the same paper that some known higher - dimensional nonlinear field theories possess the generalized zero curvature representation and , at the same time , infinitely many conservation laws . + it is the main purpose of the present paper to further develop this investigation",
    ". we shall explicitly construct different families of higher - dimensional field theories which possess the generalized zero curvature representation .",
    "further , we will find their infinitely many conservation laws as well as their exact soliton solutions .",
    "a key ingredient will be that their lagrangians are related to the volume forms on their respective target spaces , and the conserved currents are , in turn , related to the volume preserving diffeomorphisms . before introducing our investigation",
    ", it will be useful to review some known results in order to facilitate some background for the constructions that follow .",
    "+ shortly after the general proposal of @xcite , some new nonlinear field theories in 3 + 1 dimensions with two dimensional target space and possessing the generalized zero curvature representation were constructed explicitly .",
    "one first model was introduced by aratyn , ferreira and zimerman ( afz ) , and they explicitly constructed both infinitely many conservation laws and infinitely many soliton solutions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "due to the two - dimensional target space , their solitons are , in fact , topological and are classified by the hopf index .",
    "some integrable generalizations of the model of afz were discussed in @xcite , where again infinitely many conservation laws and infinitely many topological ( hopf ) solitons were found .",
    "another model giving rise to hopf solitons had been originally proposed by nicole , who found its simplest hopf soliton with hopf index one @xcite .",
    "this nicole model again possesses the generalized curvature representation @xcite , but it only gives rise to finitely many conservation laws .",
    "only a submodel of the nicole model , defined by further first order equations ( `` integrability conditions '' ) in addition to the euler ",
    "lagrange equations , possesses infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "further , for the nicole model only the simplest soliton may be found in an analytic form .",
    "higher solitons have to be calculated numerically @xcite .",
    "some generalization of the nicole model have been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , where again only one analytical soliton solution could be found in each model .",
    "both the afz model and the nicole model ( and their generalizations ) allow for static finite energy solutions because their kinetic term is chosen non - polynomial in order to have a scale invariant energy and avoid derrick s theorem .",
    "this idea of non - polynomial lagrangians is originally due to @xcite , where it was applied to a phenomenological model of pions .",
    "a more geometric understanding of the conservation laws in the models mentioned above was developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where it was shown that the conserved currents are just the noether currents of the area - preserving diffeomorphisms on target space .",
    "the off - shell divergence of these currents is proportional to the euler ",
    "lagrange equations ( for afz type models ) or to a linear combination of euler  lagrange equations and integrability conditions ( for nicole type models ) , respectively . in a parallel development ,",
    "the generalized zero curvature representation , integrability and conservation laws of chiral and non - linear sigma models were investigated , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ soon after this , the investigation was extended to field theories with a three dimensional target space , the best - known of which is the skyrme model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the skyrme model again possesses the generalized zero curvature representation , but only a finite number of conserved currents .",
    "but , again , there exists a submodel of the skyrme model which has infinitely many conservation laws @xcite .",
    "a detailed classification of the integrability of field theories with three dimensional target spaces has been performed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the abelian projection of su(2 ) yang  mills dilaton theory , which effectively has a three dimensional target space , was studied in @xcite .",
    "integrable theories with higher dimensional target spaces were investigated , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "further , the concept of generalized curvature representations and integrability was applied to non - linear sigma models on noncommutative space - time in @xcite . + after this brief review we will give the outline of the present paper , which combines and generalizes the ingredients described above : both an algebraic and a geometrical formulation of the generalized integrability , as well as the analysis of the geometry and topology of the target space and its interrelation with the symmetries and conservation laws of the field theories under investigation .",
    "+ our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly recall the idea of the generalized integrability and discuss it in the case of @xmath4 target space , concretely for the afz model .",
    "we find the geometric condition which makes this model integrable . in section 3",
    "we extend this geometric approach to models with more complicated target space manifolds .",
    "we show how one can construct integrable models based on the volume form on target space .",
    "we find a family of infinitely many conserved quantities and explain their existence by relating them with the pertinent symmetries of the target space .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the generalization to even higher dimensional target spaces . in section 5",
    "we explain how the models presented in the previous sections may be related to gauge theories with the help of the abelian projection . in section 6",
    "we use the methods of sections 3 , 4 to construct models with exact topological solitons with nontrivial values of some exotic topological charges like , i.e. , @xmath5 or @xmath6 . in section",
    "7 theories with the more conventional @xmath3 textures are investigated .",
    "we construct some families of infinitely many finite energy solutions and further find that they obey a bogomolny equation",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section 8 .",
    "the most natural geometrical object in the generalized zero curvature representation is a connection on higher loop space , and the condition of zero curvature for this connection will , in general , not lead to local equations in ordinary space time .",
    "there exist , however , sufficient local conditions which ensure the vanishing of the pertinent higher dimensional curvature and , therefore , realize the generalized zero curvature formulation in a local manner .",
    "one such sufficient condition is constructed as follows .",
    "the starting point is the specification of a lie algebra @xmath7 and an abelian ideal @xmath8 together with a connection @xmath9 and a rank @xmath10 antisymmetric tensor @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding curvature vanishes if we assume that the connection is flat and the hogde dual to @xmath12 is covariantly constant with respect to the connection i.e. , @xmath13 we say that a model possesses the generalized zero curvature representation if its equations of motion may be re - expressed in this form .",
    "further , one can notice that for a given @xmath14 field we are able to construct conserved currents which are equal in number to the dimension of the abelian ideal we used in the construction .",
    "therefore , we say that a model is integrable ( within this generalized approach ) if the corresponding abelian ideal has infinite dimensions .",
    "let us investigate how this general approach works in the case of models with two dimensional target space .",
    "here we identify the target space of the nonlinear model with a two - dimensional manifold @xmath15 . instead of",
    "real coordinates @xmath16 we introduce the complex coordinates @xmath17 . according to the general prescription we fix the lie algebra and the abelian ideal .",
    "namely , @xmath7 is the lie algebra of the @xmath18 lie group restricted to @xmath4 whereas @xmath8 is the representation space of it with arbitrary angular momentum number and magnetic number restricted to @xmath19 , that is @xmath20 .",
    "then , in the triplet representation @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is so far an arbitrary vector depending on the fields as well as their derivatives , @xmath24 is an element of @xmath25 given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "further , @xmath28 and @xmath29 constitute the basis of the lie algebra and the abelian ideal , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 are pauli matrices .",
    "the commutators are @xmath31=\\pm t_{\\pm } , \\;\\ ; [ t_+,t_-]=2t_3 $ ] , @xmath32=m p_m^{(j)}$ ] , @xmath33 = \\sqrt{j(j+1)-m(m\\pm 1 ) } p_{m \\pm 1}^{(j)}$ ] , @xmath34=0 $ ] .",
    "the connection @xmath35 is flat by construction .",
    "thus , the only nontrivial condition in the gzc formulation is the covariant constancy of the @xmath14 field . in the triplet representation",
    "this results in @xmath36 however , in a higher spin representation one gets , in addition to ( [ 2dim int eq gen ] ) , the constraint @xmath37 so , we can conclude that a dynamical model with two dimensional target space is integrable if one may define a vector quantity @xmath23 such that @xmath38 and the pertinent equations of motion read @xmath39 models with these properties are known as models of the aratyn - ferriera - zimmerman type @xcite .",
    "they are integrable in the gzc formulation sense : they have the gzc formulation with the infinite - dimensional abelian ideal .",
    "they are given by the following lagrange density @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 is any function of @xmath43 whereas @xmath44 is a positive real parameter .",
    "a particular example of such integrable models in four dimensional minkowski space - time is given by the expression @xmath45 where the value of the power is taken to avoid the derrick arguments for the non - existence of static solitons @xcite .",
    "the afz model describes , in fact , soliton excitations of a three component unit vector field which may be related via the standard stereographic projection with the complex field @xmath46 . as",
    "the static solutions are maps from compactified @xmath47 to the @xmath4 target space they carry the corresponding topological charge , i.e. , the hopf index @xmath48 .",
    "the lump like structure of the solitons emerges from the fact that the pre - image of a given point on the target sphere is a closed line . for this model",
    "such topologically nontrivial solitons ( hopfions ) have been derived in an exact form @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can also construct infinitely many conserved currents @xmath49 where @xmath50",
    "further , @xmath51 is an arbitrary function of @xmath46 and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , etc . in order to understand the geometrical meaning of this model , which may give us a clue how to generalize it to field theories with a more complicated target space",
    ", we consider the area two form on the target space manifold @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the area density .",
    "the pullback of the area two - form in the base @xmath56 minkowski space - time is @xmath57 now we are able to define two objects .",
    "namely , a rank two anti - symmetric tensor @xmath58 and a scalar density @xmath59 which are exactly the same objects as used in the construction of the afz model .",
    "observe that the density @xmath60 equals the square of the pullback of the area two - form modulo a multiplicative term depending on the area density @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , the fact which makes the afz model integrable is that it is proportional to a function of the square of the pullback of the area two - form to the base minkowski space - time .",
    "+ therefore , one can conjecture that integrable models with higher dimensional target spaces can be constructed using the square of the pullback of the pertinent volume form on the target space manifold into the base minkowski space - time . in the proceeding sections we demonstrate this hypothesis by explicit construction .",
    "following the considerations of the previous section , our starting point for the construction of integrable models with three dimensional target space @xmath61 is to consider the volume three - form on @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 together with a scalar @xmath64 are local coordinates on @xmath61 and @xmath55 is the volume density .",
    "then the pullback of the volume three - form to the base minkowski space - time is @xmath65 again , we may extract from the last formula a rank three anti - symmetric tensor @xmath66 and the corresponding scalar @xmath67 the last object is proportional to the square of the pullback of the volume three - form up to a term which does not contain any derivatives of the fields .",
    "+ then , the class of integrable models with tree dimensional target space is defined as follows @xmath68 with a positive parameter @xmath44 ( where @xmath44 may , e.g. , be chosen to guarantee the invariance of the model under the scale transformation or to provide finite energy solutions . )",
    "+ in order to write the corresponding equations of motion let us define two vector quantities closely related to the canonical momenta @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 it is easy to verify that they obey the following relations @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath75 therefore , the equations of motion @xmath76 @xmath77 may be rewritten in the following simple form @xmath78 @xmath79 the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath43 .      to express the system of equations ( [ eom h n3 1 ] ) , ( [ eom k n3 1 ] ) in terms of the generalized zero curvature condition , we specify @xmath7 to be the lie algebra of the @xmath18 lie group ( restricted to the equator ) while @xmath8 is the representation space of it with arbitrary integer angular momentum quantum number @xmath80 , but magnetic quantum number @xmath81 restricted to @xmath82 . as one can see , there is only one change in comparison with the integrable models with two dimensional target space . the abelian ideal is extended to those representations which carry also zero magnetic number .",
    "then , in spin @xmath83 representation , the flat connection and the hodge dual field are @xmath84 and @xmath85 similar fields are also used in the gzc formulation of the skyrme model , see @xcite .",
    "the covariant constancy of the hodge dual field @xmath14 gives @xmath86 @xmath87 here we used the following important properties obeyed by the objects @xmath88 and @xmath23 .",
    "namely , @xmath89 moreover , if we notice that @xmath90 then we arrive at the field equations ( [ eom h n3 1 ] ) , ( [ eom k n3 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these models are integrable .",
    "the abelian ideal we used in the generalized zero curvature is indeed infinite dimensional .",
    "+ observe that the connection @xmath91 belongs to the lie algebra of the @xmath18 lie group restricted to the coset space @xmath25 , as is the case for models with two - dimensional target space .",
    "moreover , the dual field @xmath14 is defined up to an arbitrary function of @xmath46 and @xmath92 which multiplies @xmath93 .",
    "+ finally , we prove that this family of models possess infinitely many conserved quantities as is required for the integrable systems .",
    "after some calculations one can verify that there are three families of infinitely many on - shell conserved currents @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 here @xmath97 moreover , there is a good understanding of the geometrical origin of the currents .",
    "we show that the conservation laws found for the integrable models are generated by a class of geometric target space transformations . specifically , they are the noether currents related to the volume - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "let us again consider a three - dimensional target space manifold @xmath61 , parameterized by local coordinates @xmath98 .",
    "then the volume 3-form is given by the expression @xmath99 a volume - preserving diffeomorphism is a a coordinate transformation leaving the volume form invariant . for an arbitrary infinitesimal transformation @xmath100 invariance of the volume form",
    "results in the condition on @xmath101 functions @xmath102 as the considered manifold is three dimensional we apply darboux s theorem and derive a general ( local ) solution @xmath103 where @xmath104 are arbitrary functions of the local coordinates .",
    "following that we may write a general vector field generated by a volume - preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath105 where we assumed the parametrization of the target manifold by a complex field @xmath46 and a real scalar @xmath64 introduced before .",
    "these vector fields obey the lie algebra @xmath106=\\mathbf{v}^{\\tilde{\\tilde{y}}},\\ ] ] @xmath107 in a relativistic field theory one can find a general expression for noether currents corresponding to the vector fields @xmath108 .",
    "namely , @xmath109 where @xmath110 are the standard canonical momenta . for the integrable models discussed in the previous section we get ( up to an unimportant multiplicative constant )",
    "the generalization to integrable field theories with a target space of arbitrary dimension @xmath1 is straightforward . as we described in the case of models with two or three dimensional target spaces , one should begin with the pertinent volume form on the target space manifold @xmath112 i.e. , @xmath113 for an even number of dimensions @xmath114 or @xmath115 for an odd number of dimensions @xmath116 . the local coordinates on @xmath15 are @xmath117 or @xmath117 , @xmath64 respectively for those cases .",
    "@xmath118 are complex fields while @xmath64 is a real scalar .",

    "in addition we need a scalar quantity built out of this tensor @xmath122 the integrable lagrangian reads @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a real function factor depending on the fields i.e. , coordinates on the n - dimensional manifold @xmath112 .",
    "then the equations of motion read @xmath125 and their complex conjugate together with @xmath126 if the dimension of the target space is odd . here",

    "thus , in the case of even dimensional target space @xmath114 we have @xmath136 independent families of infinitely many conserved currents . for odd dimensions @xmath116",
    "this number is @xmath137 .",
    "* remark : * + when the dimension of the target space @xmath1 equals the number of the spatial dimension of the base space @xmath10 , then the static equations of motion are trivial .",
    "in fact , then the quantity @xmath138 , being the pullback of the volume form on a target space , is a closed @xmath1-form also in the base space . as a consequence , its integral over a @xmath1-dimensional",
    "manifold only depends on the boundary conditions , that is , it gives a purely topological action ( or energy functional ) .",
    "therefore , these integrable models do not seem to lead to interesting results in the context of @xmath3 solitons .",
    "( in section 7 we show how one can circumvent this obstacle and construct actions with solitons of @xmath3 type .",
    "the main idea is to include several pullback tensors in the lagrangian . ) if @xmath139 , then the models are not longer trivial and may provide exact soliton solutions with topological charges from the homotopy group @xmath140 , as has been observed in the original afz model .",
    "it has been established that two dimensional target space integrable models of the afz type may emerge via the abelian projection of the @xmath18 yang - mills field .",
    "it results in the observation that the abelian projection of @xmath18 ym is an integrable sector of the full theory with magnetic monopoles as exact solutions @xcite . in the case of integrable models with higher dimensional target space",
    "the situation is analogous .",
    "there exists a gauge theory which , after reduction of degrees of freedom , leads to the corresponding integrable pullback model . + as a first example we consider the following model @xmath141 where the gauge fields @xmath142 from the @xmath143 lie algebra is non - minimally coupled to the scalar field @xmath64 .",
    "the field strength tensor is defined in the standard manner @xmath144 .",
    "the next step is to use the cho - faddeev - niemi - shabanov decomposition @xcite-@xcite and express the gauge fields by means of a new set of degrees of freedom @xmath145 where we introduced a three component unit vector field @xmath146 pointing into the color direction , an abelian gauge potential @xmath147 and a color vector field @xmath148 which is perpendicular to @xmath146 .",
    "now , we restrict the gauge potential to the form @xmath149 then the field strength tensor reads @xmath150 finally , taking into account the stereographic projection @xmath151 we arrive at the lagrange density @xmath152.\\ ] ] as we claimed , it has exactly the form of the integrable pullback model with three - dimensional target space ( [ model n3 ] ) , with @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",

    ", one may continue this procedure and try to find gauge theories related to higher dimensional integrable pullback models .",
    "however , we would like to have a constructive method for generating such models , instead of this guessing - like procedure .",
    "fortunately , such a method exists and is based on the observation that the gauge models ( [ gauge 3d ] ) and ( [ gauge 4d ] ) can be written in a more compact form .",
    "namely , the lagrange density ( [ gauge 3d ] ) is given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 in the same way , the model ( [ gauge 4d ] ) may be expressed as @xmath163 where @xmath164 @xmath10 is the number of the spatial dimensions .",
    "now , we are able to define gauge models which can be reduced via the abelian projection to the integrable pullback models .",

    "the additional target space degree of freedom i.e. , the field @xmath357 , depends on the new coordinates .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions , that is , to higher homotopy groups , is obvious .",
    "an alternative set - up for solitons of this type is given by the following lagrangian containing the dilaton field @xmath358 where @xmath359 depends on @xmath63 while @xmath249 on @xmath360 fields respectively .",

    "this is in contrast to models with exotic textures , for which the derrick theorem enforces nonlinear ( in the canonical momenta ) field equations . as a consequence , one gets equations which in some regions are not hyperbolical , leading to serious problems as far as time evolution of solitons is concerned .",
    "the present paper further develops and applies the generalized zero curvature approach of ref .",
    "its main results are the construction of several families of integrable models living on @xmath56 dimensional space - times and characterized by arbitrary target space manifolds of dimension @xmath1 , as well as the detailed investigation of their solutions .",
    "such models are integrable in the sense that they possess the generalized zero curvature formulation , infinitely many conservation laws and , in those particular cases we have checked , admit infinitely many static solutions with a nontrivial topological structure . the origin of the conserved currents has also been clarified .",
    "they are generated by the volume preserving diffeomorphisms on the target space .",
    "+ all these models are built from the pullback of the pertinent target space volume @xmath1-form into the @xmath56 ( minkowski ) base space , and may be multiplied by a density function depending entirely on the fields and not on their derivatives",
    ". therefore the models are trivial if @xmath366 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath367 , the integrable models describe nontrivial highly nonlinear field theories",
    ". therefore , the solitons found in these models are , in general , of a nonstandard ( exotic ) type from the topology point of view .",
    "in fact , hopfions as well as suspended hopf maps ( higher suspended hopf maps as well ) can be derived as finite energy solutions to those models .",
    "these configurations are probably not of the bogomolny type and are not given by any first order field equations .",
    "the first argument is based on the observation that the dependence of the energy on the topological charge is non - linear .",
    "the second argument is given in this work and shows that , at least for some of the models , self - dual configurations contribute to the vacuum manifold .",
    "however , this problem is by no means solved and definitely requires further studies . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the higher dimensional nonlinear models derived here may be solved exactly , in spite of the lack of bogomolny equations , is very intriguing and indicates that the generalized integrability can serve , to some extent , as an alternative to the bogomolny limit .",
    "+ using the pullback tensors , we have been able to construct models with exact solitons with more standard topological content .",
    "infinitely many finite energy static solutions with topological index belonging to @xmath258 as well as @xmath314 have been obtained . and",
    "in contrast to the previous exotic solutions , they emerge from their pertinent bogomolny equations .",
    "+ one possible direction of further investigation consists in the use of more general ansaetze .",
    "indeed , all solutions presented here have the property that the gradients of different fields are perpendicular , which simplifies the calculations significantly .",
    "relaxing this condition may give rise to more general solutions with a more complicated geometry .",
    "+ another interesting question concerns the possibility to embed these intergrable models into more complicated and , at the same time , more physically relevant theories , as discussed in section 5 .",
    "this possibility has been studied in detail for the case of yang ",
    "mills dilaton theory @xcite , which contains an integrable submodel defined by abelian projection .",
    "this submodel is of the type discussed in section 7 , but based on the topological index @xmath244 . in that case",
    "it turns out that the soliton solutions are stable in the submodel ( the obey a bogomolny bound ) , but unstable , sphaleron - type solutions in the full yang  mills dilaton theory .",
    "therefore , in the case of the embedding of integrable models into larger theories the question of stability is rather nontrivial and certainly requires a detailed study . more generally , possible embeddings into yang  mills",
    "type theories and their collective excitations may lead to applications with some experimental relevance ( e.g. , to condensates , or gluonic extended field configurations ) .",
    "these issues will be further investigated in the future .",
    "+ in any case , we think that the rather large class of integrable models together with their explicit solutions presented in this paper are of interest and will lead to further applications .",
    "let us finally mention that the conjecture relating intergrability and solvability for higher - dimensional integrable field theories continues to hold for the class of models studied in this paper .",
    "indeed , for any theory which possesses infinitely many conserved quantitites , infinitely many exact solutions may be found by simple quadratures , once an adequate ansatz has been chosen .",
    "this points towards the existence of a deep relation between integrability and solvability also in higher dimensions , analogous to the case of 1 + 1 dimensional field theories .",
