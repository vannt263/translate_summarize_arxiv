    "the storage of quantum information in an atomic ensemble has received a great deal of attention over the past ten years or so .",
    "protocols based on electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) have been investigated by many groups both theoretically @xcite and experimentally , leading to storage and retrieval demonstration of both discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite quantum variables .",
    "although successful , the eit storage scheme suffers from time - bandwidth product limitations . in eit - based protocols ,",
    "the reduction of group velocity is used to spatially confine the input signal within the boundaries of the storage medium .",
    "simultaneously , the signal spectrum must not exceed the bandwidth of the transparency window associated with eit .",
    "since the group velocity is inversely proportional to the width of the transparency window , it follows that , the larger the storage bandwidth , the shorter the temporal profile the memory can accommodate .",
    "this protocol has been demonstrated using level schemes in which inhomogeneous broadening does not play a significant role .",
    "extension to inhomogeneously broadened systems does not improve the time - bandwidth product capabilities .    on the other hand , inhomogeneous broadening can be of critical importance in other protocols for storing quantum information . for example , doppler broadening determines the storage bandwidth when a signal pulse is totally absorbed in an optically dense medium @xcite .",
    "while the temporal components of the input signal are distributed in atomic state coherence along the axial direction in eit , the spectral components of the input signal are spread over the inhomogeneous frequency distribution of the atoms in the absorption protocol . just as in eit",
    ", information is stored in a long lifetime raman coherence in the absorption protocol , but the maximum duration of the input signal is independent of the storage bandwidth , being ultimately limited only by the inverse homogeneous line width . the resulting time - bandwidth product capacity , given by the ratio of the inhomogeneous and homogeneous widths , is reminiscent of the photon - echo based storage techniques that were developed in the past @xcite . however , unlike some of those classical light storage schemes , the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite , that we shall refer to as the mk protocol , is restricted to systems where the inhomogeneous broadening is provided by the doppler effect .",
    "a variant of the mk protocol has been proposed for solids in which the inhomogeneous broadening is linked to stochastic variations in atomic transition frequency that depend on an absorbing center s position in a host medium @xcite .",
    "although there are several proof of principle experiments of this absorption - type protocol @xcite , all such experiments have involved classical input fields .",
    "it should be stressed that the large time - bandwidth product capacity is lost when the doppler shift is replaced by a more stochastic source of inhomogeneous broadening . in order to keep control of the inhomogeneous phase shift",
    ", one selects a narrow spectral group of atoms at the beginning .",
    "an external field is used to spread this initial ensemble over the desired bandwidth .",
    "hence the bandwidth is increased at the expense of the available optical density , i.e. at the expense of the capacity to trap the optically carried information within the material .",
    "a key feature in the mk scenario is that the totally absorbed signal is restored without amplification .",
    "this contrasts with previous photon echo investigations where large retrieval efficiency results from strong amplification in an inverted medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , unlike these earlier works , the mk protocol is free from the noise associated with spontaneous and stimulated emission .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that the control fields do not interact with highly populated states . as a consequence few atoms",
    "are promoted to the upper electronic level .",
    "another consequence is that , as the control fields interact with quasi - empty states , they are neither attenuated nor distorted as they travel through the active medium .    quite surprisingly , the original mk scheme has not been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "a possible issue in atomic vapors is the short lifetime of the active optical transition upper level . indeed , to combine a large optical density with the absence of collisions one has to work on strong lines with short upper level lifetime . as a consequence ,",
    "some operations have to be carried out on a nanosecond time scale .",
    "specifically , one needs nanosecond @xmath1-pulses to convert optical dipoles into raman coherences and conversely .",
    "in addition , the input signal duration is limited to a few nanoseconds .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a raman variant of the mk scheme that circumvents these limitations .",
    "direct excitation of ground state coherence avoids the introduction of rapidly decaying quantities , yet retains the other advantages of the mk protocol .",
    "quantum memories based on raman scattering have been proposed in the past @xcite . however",
    ", previous proposals did not fully examine the dynamics of the system , focusing on steady - state conditions , @xcite or they considered a situation in which the temporal signal profile is mapped into a spatial distribution of the atomic ground state coherence @xcite . in our scenario , the spectro - temporal features of the signal are stored in the _ spectral distribution _ of the ground state coherence . the experimental investigation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is actually very close to our situation , but the authors resort to a reversible magnetic field gradient to cover the signal spectrum and to reverse the atomic phase , which ultimately leads to a spatial mapping of the signal . in our case",
    "we use optical pulses to reverse the atomic phase .",
    "our objective in this paper is to describe the underlying physics of the raman protocol , a goal that can be achieved within the confines of a theory in which all radiation fields are treated classically .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : after presenting a picture of the overall process in section ii , we develop a theory for each step of the protocol in sections iii - v . in section",
    "vi we discuss the range of applicability of the storage method .",

    ", width=432,height=389 ]    the protocol consists of the four steps shown schematically in fig . [ fig1a ] .",
    "we consider an ensemble of four - level atoms .",
    "the four levels can be magnetic state sublevels of the same or different ground state hyperfine levels .",
    "the atoms are prepared initially in state @xmath6      in the first stage , a quasi - monochromatic control field and the input pulse drive raman transitions between levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "each field is off - resonant for optical excitation of level @xmath9 , but the difference of the field frequencies is close to that of the raman transition .",
    "the control and input fields have a relative propagation vector @xmath10 that leads to a doppler shift @xmath11 associated with the two - photon raman transition . as a consequence",
    "the bandwidth that can be absorbed in this raman process is on the order of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a characteristic atomic speed .",
    "of critical importance is that all frequency components of the signal field are depleted in an identical fashion ( no pulse distortion ) if the bandwidth is less than the inhomogeneous width .",
    "the medium is optically dense so the signal pulse is totally attenuated . in other words , as a result of stimulated raman scattering , the signal pulse energy is totally transferred to the control field .",
    "each atom has a negligibly small population in state @xmath14 and the entire population stored in level @xmath8 is assumed to be small as well , assuming the signal pulse is weak .",
    "the control field is turned off following the depletion of the signal pulse .",
    "in contrast to the mk protocol in which an optical coherence is created in the first stage , the signal field is transferred directly to a raman coherence in our protocol that is immune to spontaneous emission decay .",
    "the raman coherence dephases following excitation as a result of the inhomogeneous broadening . as in a photon echo experiment",
    ", this dephasing can be reversed by the application of a second pair of pulses . however ,",
    "if we were to use a two - pulse echo process , the raman coherence excited by the signal would be affected by velocity changing collisions over the _",
    "entire _ storage time between the two pulses . instead ,",
    "if we use a three - pulse echo configuration , the effect of collisions during most of the storage time can be suppressed .",
    "the second pulse pair , in effect , freezes the doppler phase created by the first pulse pair . as in the mk protocol",
    ", this phase reversal must be carried out with a raman pulse that leaves the population in level @xmath7 unchanged .",
    "this is a crucial condition to ensure uniform illumination by the control fields ; if any control field is resonant with a transition originating in level @xmath7 , the field will be strongly absorbed in the optically dense medium and unsuitable for this protocol @xcite .",
    "all these requirements are satisfied if one applies a raman @xmath1 pulse between levels @xmath8 and @xmath15 , following the excitation of the @xmath16 raman coherence .",
    "the relative @xmath10 vector of the two fields is the same as that in stage 1 , so the net effect of the @xmath1 pulse is to convert the @xmath16 to @xmath17 coherence , while freezing the doppler phase evolution of this raman coherence , just as in a stimulated photon echo .",
    "the net result is that the original pulse information is now stored in a raman coherence that is , for the most part , `` protected '' from the effects of velocity - changing collisions .      to prepare the system for the retrieval stage",
    ", a @xmath1 pulse is sent into the medium at some later time to restore the @xmath16 coherence .",
    "this raman pulse has its relative @xmath10 vector reversed and prepares the atoms with a spatial raman coherence that allows for retrieval of the signal in stage 4 .",
    "a control pulse is sent into the sample that is identical to the initial control pulse , but with its propagation vector _",
    "reversed_. the first three stages produce a raman coherence that allows a field to build up in a direction opposite to that of the input signal pulse .",
    "in other words , the depletion of the signal field is reversed and the original signal pulse is restored as it exits the sample propagating in a direction opposite to that of the original signal pulse . in principle , the pulse can be restored with close to 100% fidelity . in the context of creating a functional quantum memory device , splitting the phase reversal in two steps ( stages 2 and 3 )",
    "reduces the waiting time between the read - out pulse and the emission of the restored signal , making the retrieved data available more rapidly after the read - out decision .",
    "we now describe in detail how each of these steps can be achieved .",
    "storage corresponds to the mapping of the optically carried information into atomic raman coherence , accompanied by attenuation of the input signal field .",
    "the input signal is depleted by stimulated raman scattering in a three - level @xmath18-system .",
    "the weak pulse to be stored , combined with the control field , resonantly excites the raman transition @xmath19 .",
    "both fields are tuned off resonance from the optical transition to upper level @xmath20 .",
