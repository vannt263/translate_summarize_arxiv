    "dark soliton in matter waves is characterized by a local density minimum and a sharp phase gradient of the wave function at the position of the minimum .",
    "dark solitary wave is not a topological defect like vortices .    in a dissipative environment , it can disappear anywhere in the condensate . its quantitative study with a dissipative dynamics at finite temperature was well described @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "the dynamics of a vortex within the zaremba - nikuni - griffin formalism was studied in atomic bose - condensed gas and clarifid its microscopic origin @xcite .    in dilute atomic bose gas , the quantum theory for the nucleation of bose - einstein condensation was presented in @xcite .",
    "this process can be described by a single fokker - planck equation .",
    "symmetry breaking in the self - evolution of strongly non - equilibrium interacting bose gas can occur only as a result of introduction of a small term of the hamiltonian or as a result of quantum - mechanical measurements , which imply non - conservation of particles @xcite .",
    "dark solitons are one - dimensional phenomena , which in two- or three - dimensional ( 2d , 3d ) systems are unstable with a transverse instability . due to the snake - instability @xcite , they decay into vortex rings @xcite . a long - wavelength transverse instability that is analogous to matter - waves was observed @xcite and verified in atomic becs @xcite .    in harmonic confinement , because of the geometry of the system , a dark soliton - like wave moves with different velocities .",

    "this method can be applied to create systems with positive and negative vortices in a disc - shaped condensate , whose interactions lead to a disordered motion of vortices .    fig .  [",
    "fig : f2 ] ( right ) and fig .",

    "[ fig : f7 ] .    after applying the phase imprinting method the total",
    "energy begins to oscillate and later it relaxes to its final value .",
    "we remark that , the sound energy has the biggest contribution to the change of the total energy , which comes from the phase change , from the movement of the vortices and from the interaction between vortices and anti - vortices .",
    "this is illustrated by the fig .",

    "the compressible kinetic energy is directly concerned with the acoustic emission .    for @xmath84 , after a certain transition period , the system enters the state that is identical to the original regular vortex lattice .",
    "this is explained by the fact that although we start with different vortex configurations ( no vortices versus some artificial vortex - anti vortex pairs ) , the calculations produce identical results . in that case , the negative vortices will move to the boundary of the condensate . the corresponding variation of different energies and @xmath24 are presented by fig .",

    "@xmath23 is set to @xmath85 at @xmath75 , fig .",
    "[ fig : f9 ] ( left ) shows the energies and the @xmath86-component of the angular momentum for that case .    we can compare this method to produce turbulence with a different one , when @xmath87 = @xmath88 on the upper half part of the box @xmath89 . here",
    ", @xmath88 is the complex conjugate of @xmath11 @xcite . in that case , the number of anti - vortices and the shape of the condensate are different due to the fact that more anti - vortices and annihilations appear .",
