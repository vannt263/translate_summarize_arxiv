    "@xcite , our progress in the understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been quite spectacular .",
    "we now know that grbs are cosmological events related to a catastrophic energy release in stellar mass objects .",
    "energy dissipation within a highly relativistic `` fireball '' , presumably emitted in the form of a jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is believed to power the observed @xmath0-ray flash ( prompt emission ) and the subsequent `` afterglow '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , grbs have been divided in two main categories , long and short ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , depending on the duration of their prompt @xmath0-ray emission ( @xmath1s for the short bursts , @xmath2s for the long ones ) .",
    "these two populations of bursts are thought to be related to two different progenitor models : `` collapsars '' for the long - soft bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the merger of binary systems of compact objects such as neutron star ( ns)-ns or black - hole ( bh)-ns systems , for the short - hard ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the recent issues raised in the classification of short and long grbs based solely on their prompt emission properties ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the general picture of two classes of bursts related to two main progenitor models , still holds .",
    "the collapsar scenario is observationally supported by the fact that long grbs occur in galaxies with high specific star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that at least some long grbs have been observed to be associated with core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) of rare type @xcite .",
    "indeed , the question of what makes some stars die as sne and some other as relativistic grbs , is not solved yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "indications that progenitors of short bursts belong , on average , to old stellar populations with a typical lifetime of several gyr @xcite , provide support to the binary merger scenario .",
    "collapsars and binary mergers leading to the formation of a bh plus an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have the potential to power the grb fireball via the energy released from the accretion of the disk onto the newly formed bh . while the formation of a bh plus disk system is common to both progenitor models , the more compact scale of the ns - ns ( or bh - ns systems ) , and the less massive debris left over after merger , are invoked to explain the shorter duration and the smaller isotropic energies of these bursts with respect to long ones .    within the standard fireball model ,",
    "once the fireball is launched from the central engine , the observed radiation is explained as synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission from electrons accelerated in internal and external shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , taking place at distances @xmath3 cm from the central source .",
    "high - energy ( gev ) tails observed in some grbs have challenged the internal - external shock fireball model in its simplest formulation @xcite .",
    "however , it remains true that the electromagnetic emission from grbs , being produced at large distances from the central engine , provides indirect information on the progenitor . on the other hand , gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted from the progenitor",
    "could directly probe its nature .",
    "being related to catastrophic events involving stellar - mass objects , grbs are good candidates for the detection of gws @xcite . coalescing binaries , thought to be associated with short bursts , are one of the most promising gw sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) for detectors like the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ; * ? ? ? * ) and virgo @xcite .",
    "for such systems , a chirp signal should be emitted in gws during the in - spiral , followed by a burst - type signal associated with the merger , and subsequently a signal from the ring - down phase of the newly formed bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the last , initially deformed , is expected to radiate gws until reaching a kerr geometry @xcite .    in the collapsar scenario ,",
    "relevant for long grbs , the high rotation required to form the centrifugally supported disk that powers the grb , should produce gws via bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or fragmentation instabilities that might develop in the collapsing core ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) and/or in the disk @xcite",
    ". moreover , asymmetrically infalling matter is expected to perturb the final bh geometry , leading to a ring - down phase @xcite .",
    "ligo and virgo have been carrying out electromagnetically triggered searches for gws @xcite over the past decade ( for bar detectors electromagnetically triggered searches , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ligo scientific collaboration operates two ligo observatories in the u.s .",
    "along with the geo600 detector @xcite in germany .",
    "together with virgo , located in italy , they form a detector network capable of detecting gw signals arriving from all directions .",
    "grb - triggered searches for gws by ligo and virgo have targeted both the chirp signal expected in the case of short grbs during the ns - ns or bh - ns in - spiral , and short unmodeled pulses of gws that may be expected during the merger / collapse , and ring - down phases of short / long grbs @xcite .",
    "these searches have adopted on - source time windows of few minutes ( long grbs ) or few seconds ( short grbs ) around the grb trigger time .",
    "in fact , for long grbs , the time delay between the gw signal and @xmath0-ray trigger is thought to be dominated by the time necessary for the fireball to push through the stellar envelope of the progenitor ( 10 - 100s ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , for short grbs ,",
    "the ns - ns / bh - ns merger is believed to occur quickly , and be over within a few seconds ( naturally accounting for the short nature of these bursts ) .",
    "it is estimated that triggered searches for gws in few minutes time - windows yield a factor of @xmath4 improvement in sensitivity with respect to untriggered ones @xcite .",
    "the most exciting results from ligo grb - triggered searches of gws are probably represented by the cases of the short grbs 070201 @xcite and 051103 @xcite , whose error boxes overlap with nearby galaxies ( m31 for grb070201 ; m81 for grb051103 ) . a ns - ns binary merger scenario occurring in such hosts",
    "was excluded by ligo with rather high confidence @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility that grb070201 and grb051103 are related to ( extra - galactic ) soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) giant flares ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , could not be ruled out .",
    "indeed , ligo upper - limits for short unmodeled pulses of gws from grb070201 and grb051103 , are above the maximum gw energy emissible in sgr giant flares @xcite .",
    "a very appealing prospect is represented by the possibility of using gws to trigger electromagnetic ( radio , optical , x - ray ) follow - ups of gw sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the discovery of off - axis optical or radio afterglows @xcite triggered via the ( non - beamed ) gw emission from the grb progenitors , would yield a dramatic confirmation of the `` jet model '' , map out the beaming distribution , and provide fundamental inputs to models of relativistic outflows .",
    "radio follow - ups , in particular , are an effective tool to identify relativistic and mildly relativistic outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the absence of a @xmath0-ray trigger .",
    "finding electromagnetic counterparts to gw triggers is technically challenging due to imperfect localization of the gw signal and uncertainty regarding the relative timing of the gw and electromagnetic emissions .",
    "the localization of ligo - virgo triple - coincidence gw triggers can yield error - areas of @xmath5deg@xmath6 , possibly spread over different patches of the sky ( see e.g. fig . 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the problem of following - up with optical ( or radio , or x - ray ) telescopes such a large error - area can be partially mitigated by : ( i ) restricting the search for electromagnetic counterparts to transients in nearby galaxies ( within the ligo - virgo horizon distance ) ; ( ii ) by noticing that the most promising electromagnetic counterparts of gw events detectable by ligo and virgo",
    "are expected to be `` exotic '' ( rare ) ones ( e.g. , the orphan afterglow of a grb , and/or the  kilonova  from a binary merger - see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in 2009 - 2010 , ligo and virgo , together with partner electromagnetic observatories , performed their first `` looc - up '' - locating and observing optical counterparts to unmodeled pulses of gravitational waves - experiment ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at the time , there were two operating ligo interferometers @xcite , each with 4-km arms ( one near hanford , washington , the other in livingston parish , louisiana ) .",
    "the virgo 3-km arms detector @xcite located near cascina ( italy ) , was also operating .",
    "the looc - up search has established a baseline for low - latency analyses with the next - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo and advanced virgo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the collaboration between gw and electromagnetic observatories is likely to continue to develop over the next few years , as the scientific community gets ready for a global network of advanced gw detectors .",
    "the forthcoming years may see the development of new gw searches in coincidence with grbs , aimed at answering some of the questions opened by recent observations .",
    "in particular , a compelling result from _ swift _ has been the discovery that the `` normal '' power - law behavior of long grb x - ray light curves is often preceded at early times by a steep decay , followed by a shallower - than - normal decay ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the steep - to - shallow and shallow - to - normal decay transitions are separated by two break times , @xmath7  s and @xmath8  s  @xmath9  s. it has been suggested that the shallow phase may be attributed to a continuous energy injection by a long - lived central engine , with progressively reduced activity @xcite .",
    "newborn magnetars , besides being candidate grb progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have also been proposed to account for shallow decays or plateaus observed in grb light curves @xcite .",
    "independent support for the magnetar scenario comes from the observation of sn2006aj , associated with the nearby sub - energetic grb060218 , suggesting that the sn - grb connection may extend to a much broader range of stellar masses than previously thought , possibly involving two different mechanisms : a `` collapsar '' for the more massive stars collapsing to a bh , and a newborn ( highly - magnetized ) ns for the less massive ones @xcite .",
    "several studies have shown how magnetars dipole losses may indeed explain the flattening observed in grb afterglows @xcite . @xcite",
    "have explored a scenario in which the newly born magnetar left over after the grb explosion undergoes a secular bar - mode instability @xcite , thus producing a bar - like gw signal associated to the electromagnetic plateau , potentially detectable by the advanced ground - based interferometers like ligo and virgo ( up to distances of @xmath5mpc ) . compared to current analyses that gw detectors are carrying out ( see section [ triggered ] ) ,",
    "this scenario @xcite involves a new class of gw signals , with a longer duration ( @xmath10 s ) and a different frequency evolution .",
    "data analysis techniques for the search of longer duration gw signals possibly applicable to grb searches , are being developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ligo interferometers are being upgraded to the next - generation advanced detectors @xcite , that are expected to become operational around 2015 .",
    "virgo will also be upgraded to become advanced virgo @xcite .",
    "additionally , the new lcgt detector @xcite is being built in japan .",
    "these advanced detectors are expected to detect compact binary coalescences , possibly at a rate of dozens per year after reaching design sensitivity @xcite , so that the short - grb progenitor scenario may finally be probed directly .",
    "long - standing open questions ( e.g. , is the jet model for grbs correct ? why do some massive stars die as sne and others as relativistic grbs ? ) , or other issues raised by more recent observations ( such as the difficulties in the long - short grb classification ; the role of magnetars as grb progenitors ; the link between long grbs and sgrs , etc . ) , will greatly benefit from joint gw studies .",
    "the advanced gw detectors will provide a totally new view of the transient sky @xcite .",
    "the prospects for this new era of astronomy are exciting , and promise a return of big scientific impact ."
