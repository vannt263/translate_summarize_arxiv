    "this technique takes advantage of the many transits of short - period planets observed in the _ kepler  _ data by fitting the entire light curve and all transits simultaneously . here",
    "we apply this technique to kepler-444 .",
    "kepler-444 s planets ( b , c , d , e , and f from inside to out ) range in radii from 0.4 to 0.8 @xmath4 and in orbital period from 3.6 to 9.8 days @xcite .",
    "their period ratios are near , but not exactly on , mean motion resonances ( mmrs ; see table  [ table : prats ] ) . despite the compact architecture of the system ,",
    "it is around a star @xmath5 gyr old @xcite and therefore has likely been in a stable configuration for billions of years .",
    "a tight binary pair of m - dwarf stars also orbit together around kepler-444 with a period of approximately 460 years and a distance of @xmath6 60 au @xcite .",
    "such a configuration poses a puzzle regarding the early history of the kepler-444 system , as planetary formation and migration in a truncated protoplanetary disk in the presence of a very nearby binary star pair is not well understood , with several effects newly proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies have attempted to understand the possible histories of the system and use it to place constraints on formation mechanisms @xcite . however , such studies were unable to use the actual compositions or masses of the kepler-444 planets since they were hitherto unknown . in this paper",
    ", we use photodynamics to put constraints on the masses of the planets in the kepler-444 system and report mass detections for two of the planets : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we initially identified potential transit timing variations in the kepler-444 system by simultaneously fitting the raw _",
    "kepler  _ light curve with a planet transit model @xcite and a 1-day wide polynomial to take into account systematic effects and stellar activity .",
    "we also compute the expected period of the ttv signal between each pair of planets analytically @xcite ( table  [ table : prats ] ) , noting that period of the expected signal for planets d and e matches the ttv observations well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photottv ] ) .",
    "we find statistically significant ttv between planets d and e , but the signal for all other planets is undetectably low as theoretically expected . the same conclusion was reached independently by @xcite , a survey of many _",
    "kepler  _ systems showing ttvs .    in order to perform a more robust , simultaneous fit for all planetary parameters , we first reprocessed the raw _ kepler  _ lightcurve data .",
    "we use short - cadence ( 58.8 second integration ) data when it was available ( _ kepler  _ observing quarters 4 , 6 , and 15 - 17 ) and long cadence data ( 29.4 minute integrations ) otherwise .",
    "we first discarded points whose quality flag had a value equal to or greater than 16 .",
    "we then detrended the light curves by masking out the expected transit times plus 20% of the transit duration to account for possible ttvs and then fit a cubic polynomial model with a 1000-minute width centered on photometric data points spaced by 30 minute intervals .",
    "we interpolated between these points to determine a baseline and divide the measured flux at each data point by these values .",
    "this detrending method produces two regions of extreme curvature in the lightcurve due to edge effects , so we discard the small regions with times bjd-2454900 = 1405.10 to 1405.18 days and 1490.88 to 1490.97 days . to account for certain quarters showing higher noise levels",
    "than others despite all quarters having similar quoted uncertainties , we assign an uncertainty of 5.3030402e-05 to points in quarter 12 , 2.3470900e-04 in quarter 16 , and 6.5361999e-04 in quarter 17 , an increase over other regions by a factors of roughly 5 , 4 , and 11 respectively ( the ratio of their out of transit standard deviation ) .",
    "lastly , we increase the uncertainties in all points by a multiplicative factor of 1.38073 so that a fiducial fit to the light curve has a @xmath9 .",
    "this approach substantially increases the uncertainties on the fitted parameters compared to using the values reported by _",
    "kepler  _ , allowing unmodeled noise to propagate to the final uncertainties on our parameter posteriors .",
    "we used data from _",
    "kepler  _ data release 21 ( dr21 ) for this analysis because there is less scatter in the dr21 data compared to the dr25 .",
    "our photodynamic model integrates newtonian equations of motions for the star and five planets including the light travel time effect ( which in this case is negligible ) .",
    "when any of the planets pass in front of the star along the line of sight , a synthetic light curve is generated @xcite , which can then be compared to the data .",
    "the parameters we include for each planet in the differential evolution markov chain monte carlo ( demcmc ; * ? ? ?",

    "the star had five additional parameters : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the two quadratic limb - darkening coefficients and @xmath23 is the amount of dilution from other nearby sources .",
    "we put physically sensible , but permissive , minima ( @xmath24 ) and maxima ( @xmath25 ) on the bulk planet densities , where @xmath26 is a planet s bulk density and @xmath27 is the density of iron for a body of planet p s size . taking values from @xcite ,",
    "the maximum densities for the 5 planets from b to f respectively are ( 9.5 , 9.7 , 10.3 , 10.5 , 12.2 ) g/@xmath28 , differing due to the compressibility of iron .",
    "the prior on mass is otherwise flat between 0 and these values . since the mass and eccentricity implied by ttvs",
    "may be degenerate @xcite and result in measured eccentricity values so high that the system go unstable on timescales much shorter than the age of the system @xcite , we use a rayleigh prior on the eccentricity of all planets with width parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this is consistent with the values measured in other tightly packed planetary systems @xcite , and is consistent with long term stability because even moderate eccentricity has been shown to destabilize tightly packed systems @xcite .",
    "the dilution is well - measured @xcite so we fix @xmath30 since it would otherwise be highly degenerate with @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath31 value uncertainties may be slightly underestimated , but since @xcite report @xmath32 , this will have only a very small effect on the reported posteriors .",
    "we also fix @xmath33 for all planets since we expect very small mutual inclinations between the planets because we see five planets transit ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , even modest values of @xmath16 may greatly increase likelihood that the system becomes unstable over the system s lifetime due exchange of eccentricity and inclination on secular time scales .",
    "since the transit information gives only the stellar density and planet - to - star mass ratio ( via ttvs ) , we model with a fixed @xmath34 , which sets the overall scale of the system .",
    "we use generic flat priors in all other parameters .",

    "the autocorrelation timescale for the slowest converging parameters was approximately 60,000 generations , thus we are left with @xmath35 independent samples for each parameter . by numerically fitting the ttvs , the model produces mass constraints based on the _ kepler  _ data .",
    "consistent with the measurement of individual transit times described in  [ sec : methods ] , planets b , c , and f do not induce significant ttvs on the other planets , which means their masses are not significantly detected",
    ". however , the ttvs in planets d and e are both significant enough to confidently place upper and lower bounds on the mass .",

    "we compute the posterior of @xmath40 for each neighboring planet pair by approximating the value as @xmath41 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) , where @xmath42 for each planet @xmath43 and @xmath15 is the imaginary unit .",
    "we find the median and 68% confidence intervals or upper limits @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "we note that the interior planets are consistent with the prior alone , but the planet pair with detected masses ( d and e ) has a smaller value preferring low free eccentricity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "the absence of measurable ttvs induced by planet f on planet e also constrains @xmath48 .",
    "we also numerically integrate 100 draws from the demcmc posterior for 100 myr to make sure we are exploring regions of parameter space stable for times comparable to a reasonable fraction of the system s age .",
    "95% of the samples remain stable .",
    "since approximately equal numbers of systems are likely to go unstable in logarithmic bins of time @xcite , we expect @xmath49% of our posterior to be stable for the measured system age of @xmath611 gyr .",
    "importantly , we note that at the 95% confidence level , both planets are inconsistent with being purely iron .",
    "planet d requires a composition with a fraction of rock as least as great as mercury ( @xmath630% ) , and , like earth , planet e can be no more than 30% iron by mass .",
    "these measurements are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] along with theoretical composition tracks taken from @xcite .",

    "this is below the current rv detection threshold ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the shallow transit depth , photometric follow - up is precluded for most existing instruments .",
    "however , the esa s planetary transits and oscillations of stars mission ( plato ) has recently received approval with operational dates of 2024 - 2020 .",
    "the precision goal for plato is @xmath55 in 1 hour for stars with @xmath56 .",
    "since kepler-444 is 2 magnitudes brighter , we may expect a factor of @xmath610 times more photons and thus a precision of @xmath57 per hour .",
    "each planned 50 second exposure should therefore have a precision of @xmath58 .",
    "taking several solutions from the _ kepler  _ data posteriors , based on the planned observing strategy we produce 2-year sets of simulated plato transits beginning in 2025 .",
    "we then add gaussian noise to this data with @xmath59 . finally , we refit the combined actual _ kepler  _ data and simulated , noisy plato data to test how informative the plato measurements will be in further constraining the planet masses .",
    "we find that the mass constraints of planets d and e are improved to having @xmath620% 1-@xmath60 uncertainties .",
    "such a measurement may allow tight constraints on the fraction of the planet which is iron , rocky , or volatile , potentially distinguishing a water - rich planet from an earth - like composition .",
    "additionally , we find that in some cases planet b ( the smallest radius planet @xmath61 ) interacts with planet c sufficiently to induce observable ttvs and a 99.7% confidence ( 3-@xmath60 equivalents ) non - zero mass detection of planet b. such a measurement would make it ( as of right now ) the smallest exoplanet with a detected mass orbiting a main sequence star . to conclude",

    "since the planets are very low mass , p16 assumes they are in the type i migration regime with migration timescale , @xmath62 .",
    "if the planets migrate at different rates ( due to mass and local disk density ) , then one would expect them to approach mmrs with other planets , at which point they would get trapped near those mmrs @xcite . since the planets are up to 2% away from resonance , p16 speculate that significant relative contraction of the planets did not occur , although significant migration as a unit might have . in order to match the observed period ratios",
    ", p16 assumes that planet e is significantly ( by a factor of @xmath63 ) more massive than d. this allows e to easily migrate more quickly than , and thus contract and approach resonance with , planet d while the other planets remain relatively more distant from resonances .",
    "our photodynamical fit finds that @xmath63 , a significant departure from that assumption .",
    "this suggests that the present - day observed period ratios combined with smooth disk migration alone are generally insufficient for modeling specifics of the formation of the system .",
    "many factors may have changed the migration of the planets while the disk was present , including local disk properties @xcite or turbulence in the disk @xcite .",
    "alternately , the planets may have moved after the dispersal of the gas and dust disk , for instance via a combination of planetesimal crossings @xcite or damping from tides raised by the star @xcite .",
    "therefore , we caution against strict interpretations of observed exoplanet masses and architectures ( or ensembles of these architectures ) when it is likely that the systems have evolved substantially since their natal formation .",
    "we infer from the @xmath64 ratio that the system underwent significant orbital period changes after a migration formation , or formed in situ .",
    "we also note that very high , iron - like densities are disfavored , suggesting that large amounts of collisional stripping due to high velocity giant impacts likely did not occur @xcite .",
    "since the planets orbit very close to their host star , we consider the effects of tidal dissipation on the observed orbital period ratios .",
    "it is possible that tides on planets in or near a mmr causes their proximity to orbital resonance to change ( generally spreading planets apart away from resonance ) over gyr timescales @xcite . following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth p11 ) , we define @xmath65 as the distance from orbital resonance by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 planet s mean motion and @xmath69 is the degree of the near first order resonance between planets @xmath43 and @xmath70 .",
    "p11 equation ( 40 ) gives the relation between the change in @xmath65 as a function of time and orbital parameters of the system .",
    "to determine analytically the amount tides would move planets away from exact resonance as a function of time ( equation ( 42 ) ) , p11 integrates equation ( 40 ) from @xmath71 to @xmath72 and assumes @xmath73 , i.e. , the system begins in exact mmr . if , however , we integrate from @xmath71 to @xmath74 gyr ( the age of kepler-444 ) , and we know @xmath75 based on the observed system , we may solve for @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 , the ratio of the tidal @xmath78 factor and the love number .",
    "this factor enters via the tidal circularization time @xmath79 for the @xmath68 planet @xcite .",
    "we solve for the total change in distance from resonance since the planets formation @xmath80 .",
    "for the inner pair of planets ( b and c , @xmath81 ) , we find that @xmath82 for values of @xmath77 ranging from 1 - 1000 , using the approximation that @xmath83 which is reasonable given their similar size and proximity in the system . in the solar system , the rocky planets and large , rocky moons have @xmath84 @xcite . since the observed @xmath85 , we see that tidal dissipation was insufficient to have moved the innermost pair a significant distance from its current period ratio and rules out tidal dissipation breaking a natal mmr .",
    "these findings are confirmed by long - term numerical n - body integrations , following @xcite .",
    "the other pairs of planets have longer periods , and in the case of c and d , are further from resonance .",
    "they are thus generally less affected by tides .",
    "however , the period ratio of planets d and e are very close to resonance ( table  [ table : prats ] ) so even a small amount of dissipation may significantly impact their @xmath86 . following @xcite , we can set a limit on the tidal @xmath77 factor for the innermost planet by using their equation ( 18 ) with the observed system age and planet parameters .",
    "we find @xmath87 .",
    "this limit is very near solar system values for rocky bodies , and possibly hints that the pair started in an exact mmr and was driven apart via this mechanism .",
    "this suggests that disk migration may have driven this pair of planets together , but the lack of tidally - broken commensurabilities among the other planets suggests the migration was not smooth or there were significant external perturbations after the disk dissipated .",
