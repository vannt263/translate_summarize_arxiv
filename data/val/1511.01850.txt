    "the complicated behaviour of the simple double pendulum is well know but still fascinating  because it is probably the simplest mechanical system exhibiting chaos",
    ". we can find many interesting information about its behaviour on the web  @xcite , in books  @xcite as well as in the scientific articles  @xcite .",
    "since such a system depends on parameters , like masses and lengths of arms , its integrability analysis is very difficult . until now",
    ", there is no closed mathematical proof confirming its non - integrability .",
    "however , in the nineties of the xx century , morales - ruiz and ramis showed that integrability in the liouville sense imposes a very restrictive condition for the identity component of the differential galois group of variational equations obtained by the lineralization of the equations of motion along a particular non - equilibrium solution .",
    "the main theorem of this theory states that if the system is integrable in the liouville sense , then the identity component of differential galois group of normal variational equations is abelian .",
    "note that this is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one .",
    "for the precise definition of morales  ramis theory and differential galois group see e.g. @xcite .    the weak point of the morales",
    " ramis theory is that it requires the knowledge of a particular solution that is not an equilibrium position .",
    "unfortunately , for the ordinary planar double pendulum we can not find it , while for the fully three - dimensional double pendulum , the solutions are too simple to provide any restrictions .",
    "thus , in order to solve this inconvenience we will consider some special types of double pendula restricted to certain surfaces , for which the particular non - equilibrium solutions are known .",
    "thanks to this delicate modification we are able to proceed with the whole integrability analysis of these models , so that we can move closer to the proof of the non - integrability of the double pendulum than ever before .",
    "the first model under consideration consists of two simple pendula such that the first one with length @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 is attached to a pivot point and moves in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the second pendulum with @xmath3 and @xmath4 is restricted to the plane containing @xmath1 and parallel to the @xmath5 plane .",
    "looking at the figure  [ fig : m_1:geometry ] we can immediately write the lagrange function    @xmath6    in order to have invertible legendre transformation we assume that the determinant of the kinetic energy matrix does not vanish , which is valid provided that @xmath7 then , the hamiltonian function is the following @xmath8 and its corresponding canonical equations are given by @xmath9      .[fig : bd_m1_b ] ]    as the evolution of our system takes place in a four dimensional phase space , it is convenient to use the so - called poincar sections .",
    "these are simply the intersections of orbits with a suitably chosen surface .",
    "this and all the other numerical results were obtained using the bulirsch - stoer modified midpoint method with richardson extrapolation . figures  [ fig : p_m1_ab]-[fig : p_m1_cd ] present such sections for increasing values of energy .",
    "they were constructed for the following constant parameters @xmath10 with the surface @xmath11 and @xmath12 , restricted to the plane @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the global energy minimum corresponding to the state of rest in the bottom position of the pendula ihas the value @xmath14 .",
    "as expected , at the energy level @xmath15 the pendula oscillate near the equilibrium point as shown in figure  [ subfig : p_m1_a ] .",
    "the image is very regular , in the center we detect the stable particular periodic solution that is surrounded by invariant tori .",
    "the situation becomes more complex when we increase energy to the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the invariant tori located at the center become visibly deformed .",
    "some of them decay and we observe the bifurcations that lead to emergence of stable periodic solutions which are enclosed by a separatrix .",
    "thus , we may expect the first sign of chaotic behaviour exactly in this region .",
    "our suspicion is confirmed in figure  [ fig : p_m1_cd ] .",
    "we can notice at first sight that the chaotic behaviour appears in the region were the separatrix was located .",
    "for a non - integrable hamiltonian system , these random - looking points correspond to the fact that the trajectories can freely wander over larger regions of the phase space .",
    "the trajectories ( in contrast to the integrable system ) are no longer confined to the surfaces of a set of nested tori , but they begin to move outside the tori . loosely speaking ,",
    "the tori are destroyed .",
    "the last poincar section shows the highly chaotic stage of the system . for the energy @xmath17",
    "almost all of the regular orbits merge into a global chaotic region .",
    "figure  [ fig : bd_m1_b ] shows the bifurcation diagram representing the relationship between oscillations in @xmath18 and energy @xmath19 . for a given initial condition @xmath20 we effectively construct the poincar cross sections with cross plane @xmath11 with gradually increasing energy .",
    "the periodic motion diverges as the energy increases and finally becomes chaotic .",
    "we can also detect the stable `` windows '' between completely chaotic regions .",
    "clearly , the numerical analysis demonstrates that the system is chaotic , and the main goal of this article is to also prove that the system is not integrable for a wide range of parameters ( almost everywhere ) .",
    "below we formulate the main theorem of this subsection    the system governed by hamiltonian   is not integrable in the liouville sense in the class of meromorphic functions of coordinates and momenta , except possibly for energy @xmath21,-g[l_1(m_1+m_2)-l_2m_2]\\}$ ] .",
    "the system   has two known invariant manifolds @xmath22 for further analysis we chose @xmath23 , due to considerably simpler characteristic exponents , which will become apparent in a moment . restricting the right hand sides of   to @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 hence , we have a one - parameter family of particular solutions lying on @xmath25 @xmath26}{l_2 ^ 2 m_2}.\\ ] ] solving equations   and taking into account  , we obtain our particular solution @xmath27 , where by a slight abuse of notation we use the variable symbols for particular functions of time .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the variation of @xmath29 , then the variational equations along @xmath30 take the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "notice that equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 form a closed subsystem , called the normal variational equations , that can be rewritten as one second order differential equation @xmath35 next , by means of the change of the independent variable @xmath36 and transformation of derivatives @xmath37 we can rewrite equation   as @xmath38 with rational coefficients @xmath39 where in the last steep we used  .",
    "the explicit forms of the parameters @xmath40 are the following @xmath41 next , let us apply the classical change of the dependent variable @xmath42,\\ ] ] which transforms   into its reduced form @xmath43 where the coefficient @xmath44 is given by @xmath45+\\frac{4 \\beta + \\gamma   ( \\alpha   \\beta + \\alpha + 8     z)+3 z ( \\alpha   \\beta + \\alpha + 4 z)}{8 \\alpha      \\left(z^2 - 1\\right ) ( z+\\gamma ) ( \\beta + 1 ) } .\\ ] ] in order to avoid the confluence of the singularities we assume that @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that certain values of energy should be excluded , namely @xmath47,-g[l_1(m_1+m_2)- l_2m_2]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] notice that these two energies are the stationary point energies of the system  .",
    "the first one , @xmath48 , is the global energy minimum corresponding to the equilibrium solution when both pendula are at rest .",
    "the second energy , @xmath49 , corresponds to the case when the first pendulum is pointing down and the second one up , both at rest , although the equilibrium position is not the only solution with this energy .",
    "if there existed an additional first integral , it would not depend on the energy value , so in particular it would exist for all generic values of energy other than @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in order to exclude such an integral we can thus safely assume that   is always satisfied .",
    "however , it could happen that there is a first integral , which is conserved only on those special hypersurfaces .",
    "we can not preclude its existence from the below analysis , but note that such an isolated constant of motion would be of much less practical value . also , the physical solution corresponding to @xmath48 is just the equilibrium position ; while the poincar section in figure  [ fig : p_m1_d ] shows heavy chaos for energy @xmath49 indicating that not even a local first integral exists .",
    "it is important to note that transformations   and   change the differential galois group of equation  .",
    "however , the key is that they do not change the identity component of this group , see  @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to make the non - integrability proof it is enough to show that the identity component of the differential galois group of   is not abelian . for equation",
    "the differential galois group @xmath50 is an algebraic subgroup of @xmath51 .",
    "the following lemma describes all possible types of @xmath50 and relates them to the forms of a solution of  , see @xcite .",
    "[ lem : m_1_a ] let @xmath50 be the differential galois group of equation  .",
    "then one of the four cases can occur .    1 .",

    "@xmath50 is finite and all solutions of equation   are algebraic .",
    "@xmath59 and equation   has no liouvillian solution .",
    "let us write @xmath60 in the form @xmath61.\\ ] ] the roots of @xmath62 are the poles of @xmath44 .",
    "the order of the pole is the multiplicity of the zero of @xmath63 , and the order of @xmath44 at @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "[ lem_m_1_b ] the following conditions are necessary for the respective cases given in lemma  [ lem : m_1_a ] .    1 .",
    "every pole of @xmath66 must have even order or else have order @xmath67 .",
    "the order of @xmath66 at @xmath64 must be even or else grater than @xmath58 .",
    "2 .   @xmath66 must have at least one pole that either has odd order greater than @xmath58 or else has order @xmath58 .",
    "the order of a pole of @xmath66 can not exceed @xmath58 and the order of @xmath66 at @xmath64 must be at least @xmath58 .",
    "if the partial fraction expansion of @xmath66 is @xmath68 then @xmath69 for each @xmath70 , @xmath71 and if @xmath72 then @xmath73 .",
    "equation   has four singularities @xmath74 for @xmath75 the singularities @xmath76 are poles of the second order , and the degree of infinity is @xmath67 .",
    "taking into account the character of singularities we deduce , according to the lemma  [ lem_m_1_b ] , that the differential galois group of reduced equation   can not be reducible or finite .",
    "differential galois group can be only dihedral or @xmath51 . in order to check the first possibility",
    "we apply the second case of the so - called kovacic algorithm . here and below we will use the original formulation of this algorithm given in  @xcite as well as the notation introduced in this paper .",
    "the differential galois group of equation   is @xmath51 .",
    "first , for singular points @xmath77 , we calculate the auxiliary sets @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the difference of exponents defined by @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the coefficients appearing in expansion of @xmath44 @xmath82 in our case @xmath83 . since the order of infinity is one , the auxiliary sets are @xmath84 next , following the algorithm we look for elements @xmath85 of cartesian product @xmath86 such that @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a set of non - negative integers with @xmath89 .",
    "in is not difficult to note that there are no elements of @xmath19 satisfying this condition .",
    "thus , according to the algorithm the second case can not occur , which implies that only the fourth case is possible , i.e. , @xmath90 , and equation   has no liouvillian solution .    from our short analysis",
    "we can formulate the following conclusion . since the differential galois group of reduced equation   is @xmath51 ,",
    "the identity component of differential galois group of variational equations   is not abelian .",
    "this implies that the model of two pendula restricted to @xmath2 and @xmath5 planes respectively , is not integrable in the class of function meromorphic in coordinates and momenta .",
    "let us consider the the second model presented in figure  [ fig : m_2:geometry ] .",
    "like in the previous case , the first pendulum with mass @xmath1 and length @xmath0 is attached to the fixed point and moves in the @xmath2 plane .",

    ". figures  [ fig : p_m2_ab]-[fig : p_m2_cd ] present the poincar cross sections on the @xmath13 plane with @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as previously , the energy minimum corresponding to equilibria of both pendula is @xmath14 .",
    "we note that for the energy level @xmath15 the first section presented in  [ subfig : p_m2_a ] is strictly similar to the one ( see fig .",
    "[ subfig : p_m1_a ] ) given in our first model .",
    "the whole figure is filled with quasi - periodic orbits surrounding the stable periodic particular solution .",
    "looking at figure  [ subfig : p_m2_a ] we can also detect the region of stable periodic solution related to high order resonance .",
    "the situation becomes more complex when we increase energy to the value of @xmath96 and the invariant tori deform strongly . some of them decay giving rise to stable periodic solutions enclosed by separatrices .",
    "thus , as expected for higher values of energies the invariant tori become more and more deformed and the region corresponding to chaotic motion appears , see figure  [ fig : p_m2_cd ] .",

    "a subgroup of @xmath132 generated by a non - diagonal triangular matrix can not be finite , and thus also differential galois group can not be finite . moreover , this matrix is non - diagonalisable .",
    "thus also differential galois group g of this equation can not be a subgroup of dihedral group that correspond to the second case of the kovacic algorithm .",
    "thus the only possibilities are that @xmath50 is the full triangular group or @xmath133 .    in order to check the first possibility",
    "we apply the first case of the kovacic algorithm .",
    "if it is satisfied , then equation   has an exponential solution .",
    "first , for singular points @xmath77 we calculate sets of exponents @xmath134 of local solutions @xmath135 thus , we have @xmath136 next , according to the algorithm we look for elements @xmath137 of cartesian product @xmath138 such that @xmath139 in our case there exists only one element of @xmath19 satisfying this condition , namely @xmath140 for which @xmath141 .",

    ", we have @xmath146 , so equation   gives equality @xmath147 which can not be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath148 .",
    "although the obstructions to integrability obtained with the morales  ramis theory are one of the strongest known , the frequent obstacle in its application is finding a particular solution for a given dynamical system .",
    "the classical double pendulum , both three- and two - dimensional , has no obvious solutions which could be used to explicitly linearize the equations of motion and allow for determination of the differential galois group .",
    "thus , despite the numerical evidence @xcite and theoretical @xcite work , a proof of liouvillian non - integrability still eludes us .    the present work is a step towards proving the conjecture that the three - dimensional double pendulum has no additional first integrals .",
    "otherwise one would expect them to be present also in some restrictions of the original system .",
    "note also , that the finite set of energies for which our non - integrability result does not hold does not leave any hope for practical solving of the equations of motion , as that requires a global first integral , independent of energy .",
    "a peculiar feature of both models , which allows for such a concise analysis , is the fact that the characteristic exponents of the variational equations do not depend on the physical parameters .",
    "since the differential galois group depends on the exponents , this is a huge simplification .",
    "usually a mechanical system admits first integrals for special values of parameters because the group depends on them essentially . in this sense , the models considered here are quite exceptional .",
