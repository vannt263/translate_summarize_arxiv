    "investigation of giant resonances has had a rich history over the past six decades since the discovery of the isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr )  @xcite . of the various giant resonances that have been identified and investigated since , the compression - mode giant resonances  the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ; the `` breathing mode '' ) and the isoscalar giant dipole resonance ( isgdr ; the `` squeezing mode'')occupy the pride of place because their energy is directly related to the nuclear incompressibility , @xmath5 , from which the incompressibility of infinite nuclear matter , @xmath6 , may be deduced @xcite .",
    "the latter is critical in our understanding of a number of interesting phenomena from collective excitations of nuclei to supernova explosions and radii of neutron stars .    in this review ,",
    "we discuss some recent results on the isgmr over a series of isotopes of sn and cd .",
    "this data has provided an `` experimental '' value for the asymmetry term , @xmath7 , of nuclear incompressibility ; this term , associated with the neutron excess @xmath8 is important , for example , in obtaining radii of neutron stars in eos calculations .",
    "the experiment was performed at the ring cyclotron facility of the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) , osaka university , using inelastic scattering of 386-mev @xmath2 particles at extremely forward angles , including 0@xmath3 .",
    "details of the experimental procedures and data - analysis techniques have been provided elsewhere @xcite and are only briefly described here .",
    "self - supporting target foils of enriched @xmath9sn and @xmath10cd isotopes of thickness @xmath11510 mg/@xmath12 were employed ; special target frames with a large aperture were used in order to reduce the background caused by the beam - halo hitting the frames .",
    "data were also taken with a @xmath13c target at the actual field settings used in the experiments and energy calibration was obtained from the peak positions of the 7.652- and 9.641-mev states in the @xmath14c@xmath15 spectra .",
    "inelastically - scattered @xmath2 particles were momentum - analyzed with the high - resolution magnetic spectrometer `` grand raiden ''  @xcite and the vertical and horizontal positions of the @xmath2 particles were measured with a focal - plane detector system comprised of two position - sensitive multi - wire drift chambers ( mwdcs ) and two scintillators  @xcite .",
    "the mwdcs and scintillators enabled us to make particle identification and to reconstruct the trajectories of the scattered particles .",
    "the scattering angle at the target and the momentum of the scattered particles were determined by the ray - tracing method . the vertical - position spectrum obtained in the double - focusing mode of the spectrometer",
    "was exploited to eliminate the instrumental background  @xcite .",
    "examples of such `` free - from - instrumental - background '' inelastic scattering spectra for the sn isotopes have been provided in refs .",
    "@xcite .    a multipole decomposition analysis ( mda )",
    "procedure  @xcite was employed to extract the strengths of the isgmr , along with those for other isoscalar resonances ( up to @xmath16 = 3 ) .",
    "the associated dwba calculations were performed with the computer code ptolemy  @xcite , following the method of satchler and khoa @xcite , using the density - dependent single - folding model for the real part , obtained with a gaussian @xmath2-nucleon potential , and a phenomenological woods - saxon potential for the imaginary term .",
    "the optical - model ( om ) parameters were determined by fitting the differential cross sections of elastic @xmath2 scattering measured in a companion experiment ; the efficacy of the om parameters was tested by comparing the experimental cross sections for the first 2@xmath17 states in these nuclei with calculated cross sections using a collective form factor and previously - established @xmath18 values .",
    "again , examples of mda fits to the experimental angular distributions of the differential cross sections have been provided in refs .",
    "we have extracted strength distributions for @xmath16=0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 multipoles over the energy range 8.5 mev31.5 mev in all the sn and cd isotopes investigated in this work .",
    "the isgmr strength distributions for the cd isotopes are presented in fig .",
    "the @xmath19 strength distributions were fitted with a lorentzian function to determine the centroid energies and widths of the isgmr .",
    "these fits are shown superimposed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; the corresponding fitting parameters are presented in table  1 .",
    "also presented are the various moment ratios for the experimental isgmr strength distributions calculated over the excitation - energy range , @xmath20 = 10.520.5 mev , encompassing the isgmr peak .",
    "the results for the sn isotopes have been presented previously  @xcite .",
    "isgmr strength distributions obtained for the cd isotopes in the present experiment .",
    "error bars represent the uncertainties from fitting the angular distributions in the mda procedure .",
    "the solid lines show lorentzian fits to the data . * these results",
    "should be considered preliminary*.,width=12 ]    a note of caution is apt here .",
    "there is a small , near - constant isgmr strength up to the highest excitation energies measured in this experiment .",
    "the exact reason behind this extra strength is not quite well understood .",
    "however , similarly enhanced e1 strengths at high excitation energies were noted previously @xcite and have been attributed to contributions to the continuum from three - body channels , such as knockout reactions @xcite .",
    "these processes are implicitly included in the mda as background and may lead to spurious contributions to the extracted multipole strengths at higher energies where the associated cross sections are very small .",

    "from such an analysis of the isgmr data in the sn isotopes , we had obtained a value of @xmath66  mev ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "an identical analysis of the isgmr data in the cd isotopes gives a preliminary value of @xmath67  mev ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . these numbers are in good agreement with each other , and are also consistent with the value of @xmath68  mev obtained from an analysis of the isotopic transport ratios in medium - energy heavy - ion reactions @xcite , the value @xmath69  mev obtained by centelles _",
    "@xcite from constraints put by neutron - skin data from anti - protonic atoms across the mass table , and @xmath70 mev obtained by sagawa _",
    "by comparing our sn isgmr data with calculations using different skyrme hamiltonians and rmf lagrangians @xcite . a more precise determination of k@xmath71 will likely result from extending the isgmr measurements to longer isotopic chains .",
    "this provides strong motivation for measuring the isgmr strength in unstable nuclei , a focus of current investigations at the new rare isotope beam facilities at riken , ganil , gsi , and nscl .",
    "systematics of the difference @xmath72 in the cd isotopes as a function of the `` asymmetry - parameter '' ( ( n - z)/a ) ; @xmath60 = -5.2@xmath730.7 mev  @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents a least - square quadratic fit to the data .",
    "the dashed line shows , for comparison , results with the value @xmath63 = -550 mev previously obtained from the sn data . * these results should be considered preliminary*.,width=468 ]    from the isgmr and isgdr data , one now has a consistent value for @xmath74  mev @xcite .",
    "combined with the `` experimental '' value of @xmath63 , this can provide a means of selecting the most appropriate of the interactions used in eos calculations .",
    "for example , this combination of `` experimental '' values for @xmath64 and @xmath63 appears to rule out a vast majority of the skyrme - type interactions currently in use in nuclear structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "pearson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that our data for the sn isotopes may be fitted with @xmath63 = -300 mev , a value they claim is more amenable to many theoretical calculations .",
    "they fix the @xmath75 term at this value and by introducing a higher - order term , @xmath76 , with @xmath63 in the expansion , obtain a reasonable fit to the data . in effect , they have changed the fitting expression from y = a + bx@xmath62 ( which we had used ) to y = a + ( b+c)x@xmath62 and fixed a and b , to obtain a value for c from fit to the data .",
    "clearly , there are several problems with their approach .",
    "first , considering that c would change very little ( @xmath113% ) over the range of the fit while the x@xmath62 term changes by  230% , c is , for all practical purposes ( and definitely for the uncertainties involved in the extraction of the coefficient ) , a constant .",
    "so , the fit of pearson _ et al .",
    "_ replaces one constant with two and , of course , one can find a large number of combinations of b and c that would give essentially the same fit as the one given by b !",
    "[ because pearson _ et al .",
    "_ choose to fix b at -300 mev , they obtain a value of -1900@xmath77 mev for c. indeed , if they had chosen the value of -100 mev for b , they would get the same fit for c = -2880@xmath77 mev ! ] .",
    "second , they do not discuss at all the `` reasonableness '' of the value for @xmath78 ( -1900 mev ) that is obtained in their fit .",
    "nominally , one expects the higher order terms to be smaller than the leading terms . in this case , the higher - order term is nearly 30% larger ! in this context , we note that the value for @xmath78 that they obtain with @xmath63 = -550 mev , leads to the higher - order term being only about 30% of the leading - order term , a much more reasonable situation .",
    "finally , there is also the issue of their use of a value of 370 mev for the surface term @xmath79 ( = @xmath80 in eq . 2 above ) .",
    "per almost all theoretical estimates , the value of @xmath81 1 ( see refs .",
    "_ obtain @xmath82 = 1.54 but , again , do not justify a number at such variance from other theoretical work .",
    "we have measured the strength distributions of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) in the even - a sn and cd isotopes via inelastic scattering of 386-mev @xmath2 particles at extremely forward angles , including 0@xmath83 .",
    "the asymmetry - term , @xmath7 , in the expression for the nuclear incompressibility has been determined to be @xmath11 -500 mev from the isgmr data and is found to be consistent with a number of indirectly extracted values for this parameter .",
    "measurements with the new rare isotope beam facilities would go a long way in extending the isotopic chains , thus greatly reducing the uncertainty in the extracted value of @xmath63 .",
