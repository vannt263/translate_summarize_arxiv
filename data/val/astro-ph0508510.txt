    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to be the brightest electromagnetic explosions in the universe after the identification of their cosmic origin ( metzger et al .",
    "two categories of these erratic , transient events have been identified , i.e. long - soft and short - hard ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the association of long grbs with very energetic core - collapse supernovae has now been well established ( galama et al . 1998 ; macfadyen et al .",
    "1999 ; bloom et al . 1999 ; stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; thomsen et al . 2004 ; malesani et al .",
    "several short grbs have been localized and observed by swift and hete-2 recently , which are found to reside in nearby galaxies , some of which are of early - type with little star formation ( gehrels et al . 2005 ; fox et al .",
    "2005 ; villasenor et al . 2005 ; hjorth et al . 2005a ; barthelmy et al . 2005 ; berger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this indicates that they have a distinct origin from the long species .",
    "most of the well localized grbs , both long and short , are followed by long - lived , decaying afterglows in longer wavelengths ( costa et al . 97 ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ; frail et al .",
    "1997 ; gehrels et al . 2005 ; fox et al . 2005 ) .",
    "long grbs have been themselves classified into two groups , optically bright and optically dark , based on whether or not an optical transient is detected to a given brightness limit at a given time delay ( e.g. groot et al .",
    "1998 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2001 ; berger et al .",
    "2002 ; jacobsson et al .",
    "2004 ; rol et al .",
    "the origin of optically dark grbs is still unclear . very early , tight upper limits made by the swift uv - optical telescope indicate that the darkness is not caused by observational biases ( roming et al .",
    "2005 ) . based on x - ray afterglow data ,",
    "a tentative bimodal distribution of x - ray luminosities has been also noticed ( ber & gendre 2000 ; gendre & ber 2005 ) .    over more than 8 years of optical afterglow hunting",
    ", more than 70 optically - bright grbs have been detected , among which 44 bursts have well - sampled light curves and redshift measurements (  2 ) . in this letter",
    "we present a systematical analysis to these 44 optical afterglow light curves in the cosmic rest frame .",
    "we find a fact that their late - time lightcurves follow two apparent universal tracks (  3 ) .",
    "we then conclude that within the optically bright grbs there exist two sub - categories , the luminous group and the dim group (  4 ) .",
    "cosmological parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 km mpc@xmath8 s@xmath8 have been adopted throughout this letter .",
    "we make a complete search from the literature for the @xmath0-band afterglow light curves detected during the time period from feb .",
    "1997 to aug . 2005 . we obtain a grb sample with 44 grbs , which is tabulated in table 1 .",
    "these light curves have at least four detections in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the redshifts of the bursts are available .",
    "we collect the following data for these bursts from published papers or from gcn reports if the former are not available and the extinction @xmath9 of each burst from the same literature to reduce the uncertainties introduced by different authors .",
    "] , i.e. redshift ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath0-band magnitude , spectral index ( @xmath11 ) , and extinction by the host galaxy ( @xmath12 ) . for those bursts whose @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not available , we take @xmath13 , the mean value of @xmath11 in our sample , and @xmath14",
    ". galactic extinction correction is made by using a reddening map presented by schlegel et al .",
    "the extinction curve of the milky way(pei 1992 ) is adopted to calculate the extinction in the local frame of the grb host galaxy .",
    "the @xmath15-correction in magnitude is calculated by @xmath16 . for late time data ,",
    "possible flux contribution from the host galaxy is subtracted .",
    "we convert the corrected magnitudes to fluxes ( @xmath17 ) by using the photometric zero points given by fukugita et al .",
    "the luminosity at the cosmic proper time @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is calculated by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the luminosity distance at @xmath10 .",
    "the luminosity error is calculated by @xmath22 ^ 2\\}^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath23 is the observed uncertainty of the @xmath0 band magnitude , @xmath24 is the uncertainty of the host galaxy extinction at the cosmic rest frame wavelength @xmath25 , and @xmath26 $ ] is the error of the @xmath15-correction .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath0-band light curves [ @xmath19 vs. @xmath27 are displayed in figure 1 for 42 bursts .",
    "the two nearby grbs , 980425 and 031203 are not included , since their light curves are significantly contaminated by the underlying supernova component ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; thomsen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is found that although the light curves at @xmath28 days vary significantly , they are clustered and follow two apparent universal tracks at @xmath29 days , indicating that within the optically bright grbs there exist two well - separated sub - categories .",
    "the majority of the bursts ( @xmath30 ) comprises an optically luminous grb group , which includes the well - studied grbs such as 030329 , 990123 , and 990510 .",
    "it is interesting that although the isotropic gamma - ray energy ( @xmath31 ) of grb 990123 and grb 030329 differ by almost 2 orders of magnitude , their late optical afterglow luminosities are similar .",
    "the other @xmath32 grbs in our grb sample comprises the dim group , with the representative bursts being grbs 021211 and 041006 .",
    "we zoom in these light curves in the time regime from 0.1 days to 10 days in the inset of figure 1 .",
    "the bimodal lightcurve trajectories during this are more clearly visible . based on the separation of the two groups by the luminosity at @xmath33 day ( @xmath34 , see figure 2 ) and adopting a typical temporal decay index @xmath35 , we draw a division line for the two groups as @xmath36 ( the dashed line in figure 1 ) .",
    "it is found that 25 ( out of 34 ) and 7 ( out of 10 ) light curves in the luminous and dim groups , respectively , cover this time regime and do not cross over the division line .",
    "they are the most representative ( with the smallest scatter ) ones in both groups .",
    "the bursts in the luminous group are typically brighter than those in the dim group by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "we read off or extrapolate / interpolate the luminosity at a given epoch from the light curves , and perform rigorous statistics to access the bimodality of our sample .",
    "we first select the intrinsic luminosity at 1 day for our purpose .",
    "our consideration is two folds .",
    "first , the early optical light curves may have contributions from the reverse shock component or additional energy injection from the central engine .",
    "the optical band may be below the cooling frequency or even below the typical synchrotron frequency so that the flux sensitively depends on many unknown shock parameters .",
    "on the other hand , the late emission is fainter and may contain luminosity contamination from the host galaxy .",
    "second , most of the observations were made around this epoch .",
    "this makes the luminosity derivations more reliable .",
    "figure 2 shows the 2-dimensional distribution of the intrinsic r - band luminosity at 1 day day , both giving @xmath38 .",
    "the galactic extinction corrected luminosities are @xmath39 for grb 980425 and @xmath40 for grb 031203 . ] , @xmath41 , versus @xmath31 ( panel a ) , and the distributions of the two quantities , respectively ( panels b and c ) .",
    "flux thresholds in both the @xmath42-ray and the optical bands introduce selection effects against low - energy , low - luminosity bursts , and these are indicatively marked as the grey regions in figure 2 .",
    "there are three most prominent outliers whose light curves deviate from the universal light curves , i.e. grbs 970508 , 030226 , and 050408 .",
    "they are excluded in the statistical analyses ( see more detailed discussion in  4 ) .",
    "while the @xmath43 distribution displays a power - law with sharp cutoff around @xmath44 ergs ( due to the selection effect ) , @xmath45 shows a well - defined bimodal distribution , which is well fitted by a two gaussian model centered at @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the bimodality is at a confidence level of 3@xmath50 tested by a classification algorithm with the minimum euclidian distance discriminant and the kmm algorithm ( ashman et al . 1994 ) .",
    "a bootstrap test ( @xmath51 bootstrap samples ) shows that the distributions of the means of @xmath45 of the two groups and their covariance ( @xmath52 ) are normal , which gives @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 at @xmath56 significance level .",
    "these results indicate that the bimodality is not due to statistical fluctuations .    in order to further examine the bimodal distribution at different epoches",
    ", we also derive the distributions at @xmath57 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "we find that the distribution of the luminosities at @xmath58 is bimodal with a @xmath56 significance level .",
    "the bimodality of the luminosity distribution at @xmath59 has a lower ( i.e. @xmath60 ) statistical significance .",
    "nonetheless , the distribution still stands with a gap at @xmath61 .",
    "the lower significance is expected , because of the various factors ( e.g. reverse shock , early injection , etc ) concerning the early afterglows .",
    "we have derived the intrinsic @xmath0 band afterglow lightcurves within the cosmic proper rest frame with a completed sample observed from feb .",
    "1997 to aug . 2005 .",
    "these light curves follow two apparent universal tracks after 2 hours since the grb triggers .",
    "the optical luminosity at 1 day clearly shows a bimodal distribution , with the peak luminosities being @xmath1 for the luminous group and @xmath2 for the dim group .",
    "one interesting feature for the dim group is that these bursts all appear to have low redshifts .",
    "it has been previously speculated that nearby grbs might be different from their cosmological brethren ( norris 2002 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ; guetta et al .",
    "2004 ) . in our sample , the two well - known nearby grbs , 980425 and 031203 ,",
    "both belong to the dim group . except grb 980613 ( @xmath62 ) and grb 021211 ( @xmath63 )",
    ", other bursts in the dim group all have @xmath64 . besides the low-@xmath10 property ,",
    "the bursts in the dim group all have an isotropic @xmath42-ray energy much lower than that of the bursts in the luminous group .",
    "they also have simple lightcurves .",
    "all the bursts in the dim group have a single gamma - ray pulse , except for grb 990712 who has two well - separated pulses .",
    "we notice that the observed @xmath0-band magnitudes for the dim grbs are generally @xmath65 mag a few days after the trigger . although a burst with @xmath66 ( the typical 1-day optical luminosity for the dim group ) should be detected up to @xmath67 for an observation threshold of @xmath68 mag , the efficiency to detect optical transients fainter than @xmath69 is dramatically reduced .",
    "the observational bias for the deficit of high - redshift , optical - dim grbs thus can not be ruled out .",
    "the extinction effects have been carefully taken into account .",
    "the data indicate that the dim grbs do not exhibit significantly higher extinction than the luminous ones .",
    "it has been suggested that dust in the host galaxy may be destroyed by early radiation from @xmath42-ray bursts and their afterglows ( waxman et al .",
    "2000 ; fruchter et al .",
    "it is found that the optical extinctions are @xmath70 times smaller than what are expected from the x - ray absorption ( galama et al .",
    "2001 ) , and that the dimness of grb 021211 , a representative burst in our dim group , could not be explained by the extinction effect ( holland et al .",
    "the apparent bimodality therefore could not be interpreted by the extinction effect .",
    "our results then suggest that there might be two types of progenitors or two types of explosion mechanisms in operation .",
    "some grbs show an initial shallow decay before landing onto the luminous branch .",
    "grb 970508 is the most prominent one .",
    "the light curve is initially almost flat before re - brightening at about 0.5 days , peaks at 1 day , and eventually settles onto the luminous branch , although with significant fluctuations ( pedersen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these fluctuations are similar to those observed in grbs 000301c , 021004 , and 030329 . the initial shallow decay and fluctuations are thought to be due to additional energy injections during the afterglow phase ( dai & lu 2001 ; bjrnsson et al .",
    "2004 ; fox et al .",
    "2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "grbs 050408 and 050319 have the similar behavior .",
    "when injection is essentially over , the total afterglow kinetic energies of these bursts are similar to those of the bursts in the luminous group",
    ". therefore they should be classified into the luminous group .",
    "another type of outliers are those light curves with a sharp rapid decay at early times .",
    "grb 030226 is the most prominent one in our sample .",
    "this may be attributed by an early jet break , and the rapid decay effect is due to the sideways expansion of the jet , which significantly reduces the optical luminosity ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "the two apparent universal lightcurve tracks at later times are intriguing .",
    "it is widely believed that afterglows are synchrotron emission from shocked circumburst medium as the fireball is decelerated ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ; see also reviews by mszros 2002 , zhang & mszros 2004 , piran 2005 ) . at a late enough epoch",
    ", the optical band may be above both the typical synchrotron frequency and the synchrotron cooling frequency .",
    "in such a spectral regime and at a particular epoch ( e.g. @xmath71 d ) , the optical luminosity @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the fireball , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are shock energy equipartition factors for electrons and magnetic fields , respectively , and @xmath76 is the electron spectral index .",
    "we can see that @xmath41 is medium - density - independent , and only weakly depends on @xmath75 .",
    "the universal afterglow luminosity therefore suggests that both @xmath73 and @xmath74 are standard values around 1 day for each subclass . a standard @xmath74 suggests universal properties of relativistic shocks .",
    "a standard @xmath73 , on the other hand , is intriguing , since @xmath43 vary for 4 orders of magnitude among long duration grbs and they generally follow a power - law distribution with a cutoff at low luminosity end ( schmidt 2001 , norris 2002 ) .",
    "they become standard only when jet beaming correction is taken into account ( frail et al .",
    "our results are consistent with the picture that grbs with a higher @xmath77 tends to have a higher @xmath42-ray emission efficiency ( lloyd - ronning et al .",
    "the @xmath73 derived using 10-hour x - ray data requires a jet beaming correction to achieve a standard value ( berger et al .",
    "the early x - ray afterglows in the cosmic proper frame for a group of grbs observed with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope indicate a large scatter of @xmath73 at early time ( chincarini et al . 2005 ) .",
    "our results therefore suggest a possible evolution of @xmath73 with time .",
    "one scheme might be that grb jets are initially structured ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; rossi et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the early @xmath42-ray and x - ray properties are sensitive to the observer s viewing angle .",
    "the jet structure tends to smear out with time , so that at later times , the outflow is more isotropic and the viewing angle effect no longer plays an essential role .",
