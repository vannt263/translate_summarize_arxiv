    "it is well known that due to their accuracy and efficiency , spectral methods have great advantages over local methods in solving applicable scientific and engineering problems @xcite . given a hyperbolic system of nonlinear conservation laws @xmath0 with initial condition @xmath1 its solution may not exist in the classical sense because of possible discontinuities . the direct use of spectral methods to this problem will encounter the gibbs oscillations @xcite , which lead to blow - up in the time integration .",
    "therefore , it has been of great interest in making spectral methods applicable to the hyperbolic conservation law systems in the past two decades .",
    "the expectation , as point out by gottlieb @xcite , is that the use of spectral methods will enable us not merely to capture the shock , but also to capture the delicate features and structures of the flow .",
    "obviously , spectral approaches will be extremely valuable to a class of aerodynamical problems that involve the interaction of both turbulence and shock @xcite .",
    "such an interaction is some of the most challenging problems in computation fluid dynamics .",
    "the main objective of previous studies is to recover smooth solutions from those that are contaminated by gibbs oscillations and , meanwhile , to improve the rate of convergence . for shock - capturing ,",
    "many up - to - date local methods , such as weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) scheme @xcite , central schemes @xcite , arbitrary - order non - oscillatory advection scheme @xcite , gas kinetic @xcite , and image processing based schemes @xcite , perform well .",
    "the success of these local shock - capturing schemes lies in their appropriate amount of intrinsic numerical dissipation , which is introduced either by explicit artificial viscosity terms , or by upwinding , or by appropriate local average ( non - oscillatory central schemes ) , or by relaxation @xcite .",
    "the characteristic decomposition based on roe s mean matrix can also be considered as a local averaging on the jacobian matrix @xmath2 . in his recent work",
    ", leveque @xcite outlined the relation between some approximate riemann solvers and relaxation schemes .",
    "the relative amount of numerical dissipations may explain why the local characteristic decomposition is not necessary in low - order methods while it seems to be indispensable in high - order methods @xcite .",
    "however , when these local methods are used in the cases where flow structures with fine details are needed to be resolved together with shocks , numerical dissipations are usually found to be so large that they smear the fine details @xcite .",
    "the spectral methods , on the contrary , contribute very little numerical dissipation and dispersion in principle when used to approximate spatial derivatives .",
    "nevertheless , when they are applied to the approximation of spatial derivatives on a domain containing discontinuities , the gibbs oscillations again have to be suppressed by appropriate means , for which there are two general routines : ( 1 ) explicit artificial viscosity , e.g. spectral viscosity ( sv ) method proposed by tadmor @xcite and ( 2 ) filtering , which is the central issue of the present study .    at present",
    ", most filters are constructed in the spectral domain and they can be called spectral filters .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a list of typical spectral filers , i.e. lanzos filter , raised cosine filter , sharpened raised cosine filer and exponential cutoff filter .",
    "more sophisticate and effective filters in spectral domain are vandeven s @xmath3-th order filter @xcite , cai _ et al .",
    "_ s sawtooth function @xcite and gottlieb and tadmor s regularized dirichlet function @xcite .    apart from methods that are implemented in the spectral domain ,",
    "filters in the physical domain are also developed . to design an appropriate filter in the physical domain",
    "is generally more difficult than in the fourier domain .",
    "a straightforward procedure is to make use of numerical dissipation partially contained in _ high - order _ shock - capturing schemes @xcite , such as the eno scheme , where , actually , numerical dissipations were introduced both in the fourier domain ( via an exponential filter ) and in the physical domain ( via eno polynomial interpolation ) .",
    "such a strategy was generalized by yee _",
    "@xcite to the so - called characteristic filter method ( with finite difference or finite volume ) which has been successfully applied to shock - capturing and turbulence simulations .",
    "another procedure was initiated by gottlieb @xcite by using the gegenbauer polynomial to resolve the oscillatory partial fourier summation .",
    "some promising numerical results from the filter approach can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some prominent issues may hinder the success of filtered spectral methods for practical numerical computations involving shocks .",
    "in our view , there are two very important issues that are vita to the success of a filtered spectral scheme .",
    "the first issue is how to select optimal filters for shock - capturing .",
    "the issue is very complex and can not have a unique answer at this point because there are so many properties to mind , such as flatness , ripple , filter length , effective frequency range and length of transition band , to name only a few . loosely speaking ,",
    "it is desirable to have filters that are free of dispersion errors , flat while having very small transition band , short in length while having high resolution .",
    "moreover , what adds to the complexity is that solutions to different hyperbolic conservation law systems may have different fourier spectral distributions .",
    "consequently , one faces the difficulty that an optimal filter for a problem may not even work for another one .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a filter which accounts for this change by an adjustable parameter .",
    "the second issue also concerns the change of solution , but is due to the time evolution for a given hyperbolic conservation law system .",
    "as the fourier spectral distribution of a given problem changes with time , the question is how to implement the filter ?",
    "it will be too dissipative for many systems if a filter is applied at each time step of the integration .",
    "therefore , an adaptive implementation , which is controlled by a sensor during the time integration , is appropriate .",
    "given the complexity , it is unlikely that there will be an ideal solution to these issues in the immediate future .",
    "obviously , these challenging and interesting problems call for the further study of spectral filter approaches .",
    "the objective of this work is to construct , analyze and implement a class of high - order lowpass filters which can be used either in the fourier domain or in the physical domain .",
    "these filters are constructed within the framework of the discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) algorithm @xcite and they are used to suppress gibbs oscillations arising in the fourier pseudospectral method ( fpm ) .",
    "such lowpass filters have a wide effective wavenumber range that makes it possible to capture the fine flow structures , which is a desirable objective of spectral methods for hyperbolic conservation law systems .",
    "it is this effective wavenumber range that controls the resolution of the overall method . in our design",
    ", this effective range can be varied according to the resolution requirement by a parameter .",
    "different dsc kernels have different magnitude responses and adjustability in the fourier domain , which in turn influence the accuracy and resolution .",
    "the dsc filters used in this work were originally designed in a conjugate filter oscillation reduction ( cfor ) @xcite scheme . by `",
    "conjugate filters ' it means that the effective wavenumber range of the lowpass filter is largely overlapped with that of the highpass filter which is used for the approximation of spatial derivatives .",
    "the resulting fourier domain algorithm is essentially a windowed fourier pseudospectral method for shock - capturing .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section ii , a brief introduction will be devoted to the construction of the dsc lowpass filters followed by a discussion of two types of implementations of these filters to spectral methods .",
    "extensive numerical experiments are carried out in section iii , including burgers equation , shock - tube problems , shock - entropy wave interaction , shock - vortex interaction . the shock - capturing ability and the high resolution feature of the present method",
    "are addressed . concluding remarks end this paper .",
    "in the context of distribution theory , a singular convolution is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a singular kernel and @xmath6 is an element of the space of test functions .",
    "interesting singular kernels include that of hilbert type , abel type and delta type . the former two play important roles in the theory of analytical functions , processing of analytical signals , theory of linear responses and radon transform . since delta type kernels are the key element in the theory of approximation and the numerical solution of differential equations , we focus on singular kernels of the delta type @xmath7 where superscript @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9th - order ` derivative ' of the delta distribution @xmath10 , with respect to @xmath11 , which should be understood as generalized derivatives of distributions . when @xmath12 , the kernel @xmath13 is important for the interpolation of functions . in this work ,",
    "only the case of @xmath14 will be involved .",
    "one has to find appropriate approximations to the above singular kernel , which can not be directly realized in computers .",
    "to this end , we consider a sequence of approximations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a parameter which characterizes the approximation with the @xmath17 being a generalized limit . among various candidates of approximation kernels",
    "@xcite , regularized shannon kernel ( rsk ) @xmath18 is frequently used due to its close link to the shannon sampling theorem . in this formula , @xmath19 is the grid spacing and @xmath20 determines the width of the gaussian envelop . for a given @xmath21 , the limit of @xmath22 reproduces the delta kernel ( distribution ) . with the rsk",
    ", a function @xmath23 can be approximated by a discrete convolution @xmath24 where @xmath25 are a set of discrete grid points which are centered at @xmath11 , and @xmath26 is the computational bandwidth , or effective kernel support , which is usually smaller than the computational bandwidth of the spectral method - the entire domain span . equation ( [ eq : dsc ] ) is often referred as a dsc and the rsk is used as the prototype of a dsc lowpass filter .",
    "the feasibility of the dsc - rsk as lowpass filters in numerical computation is based on an important observation : by adjusting the ratio @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) of the regularizer , one can control the effective wavenumber region and thus , control the resolution of the lowpass filter .",
    "we plot the frequency response profile of the dsc - rsk lowpass filter in fig .",
    "[ dsckernel ] .",
    "a distinct property of the rsk lowpass filter is that there is no ripples in its passband ; thus the application of this filter will not impart the low frequency .",
    "in contrast , some lowpass filters constructed with certain polynomials may have ripples in their passband , which would rule out their application to numerical integrations , especially for long time evolution , where the solution may be distorted after repeated filtering .",
    "the maximum effective wavenumber ( frequency ) range of the dsc - rsk is determined by the ratio @xmath27 , which in turn is determined by computational bandwidth @xmath29 .",
    "the philosophy is simple since with the increase of @xmath29 , the gaussian window should also be enlarged to fully utilize the stencil .",
    "the optimal values @xmath27 at different @xmath29 can be estimated and they characterize the effective wavenumber range . the larger the optimal @xmath27 is , the wider the effective wavenumber range will be .",
    "when @xmath27 value is chosen larger than the optimal value for a given @xmath29 , the accuracy of the resulting filter will be degraded by oscillations .",
    "hence we do not recommend the use of @xmath27 beyond the optimal value unless in some circumstances where the filer is utilized to stabilize a long - time integration .",
    "we denote @xmath30 the proposed dsc - rsk lowpass filter in the physical domain @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 its image in the fourier domain , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the obvious relation between @xmath36 and @xmath32 is @xmath37 as in the previous work @xcite , filtering in the fourier domain is usually accomplished by multiplying the given fourier coefficients @xmath38 by @xmath39 directly , i.e. , a windowed fourier transform , @xmath40 therefore , the _ modified _ fourier coefficients @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : filter1 ] ) are the fourier coefficients of a",
    "_ localized _ version of the original function @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "hence , errors arising from the discontinuity are also localized and the accuracy away from the discontinuity can be ensured . in practical applications ,",
    "one only needs to carry out the filtering and differentiation @xmath44 in one step @xmath45 a standard forth - order runge - kutta ( rk-4 ) scheme is employed for the time advance scheme in this work .",
    "we use a tvd switch to adaptively activate the application of the dsc - rsk lowpass filter .",
    "whenever the total variation of the approximate solution in the two consecutive time steps exceeds a prescribed criteria , the lowpass filter is activated .",
    "the dsc - rsk lowpass filter is only applied at the end of each full rk-4 cycle .",
    "the reader is referred to our earlier work @xcite for the detail of this adaptive filtering .",
    "it is more difficult to apply the filter in the physical domain than in the fourier domain . on one hand , it is not easy to quantitatively analyze the influence of numerical dissipation in the physical domain . on the other hand , the convolution operation @xmath46 complicates the physical domain application of the filter",
    ". however , in some practical applications , it turns out to be quite necessary to implement the filter in the physical domain , especially for problems whose boundaries require some special treatments . the reflective boundary is one of such examples that need to be treated by using grid points outside the computational domain . in this work ,",
    "we propose the method to apply our dsc - rsk lowpass filter in the physical domain . due to the fact that the rsk lowpass filter is an interpolatory kernel , we consider a two - step procedure .",
    "step one is the prediction of mid - mesh values from the nodal values @xmath47 the other is the reconstruction of the nodal values from the mid - mesh values @xmath48 where , @xmath49 denotes @xmath50 and @xmath19 is the grid spacing .",
    "the lowpass filter with a @xmath27 value smaller than the optimal value is used in one of these two steps .",
    "the activation of the rsk lowpass filter is controlled in the same manner as that of the frequency domain algorithm .",
    "as described , the dsc - rsk lowpass filter can be applied either in the physical domain or in the fourier domain . in general , filtering in the fourier domain is much easier and more convenient than in the physical domain because no additional summation is required to implement the filter in the fourier spectral method .",
    "in contrast , the physical domain implementation requires two additional summations .",
    "therefore , we have used the filter in the fourier domain in most of our numerical experiments except for the cases in which the reflective boundary condition is involved .",
    "we have checked that whenever applicable , results obtained from the fourier domain approach and the physical domain approach are identical .",
    "once the time integration has been completed , a strong filter is usually required for post processing the solution so as to make the solution more presentable . in principle",
    ", we only need to reduce the @xmath27 value of the dsc - rsk lowpass filter at the last time step of the computation . as an alternative",
    ", we provide a series of lowpass filters based on the lagrange delta kernel which is given by @xmath51 fig .",
    "[ lagkernel ] shows the magnitude response of the lagrange delta kernel .",
    "in fact , the highpass versions of these filters are graphically identical to centered finite difference ( fd ) schemes . in our numerical experiments ,",
    "we adopt lagrange-2 or lagrange-4 as post processing filters .",
    "their efficiency is demonstrated by our numerical results .",
    "in this section , we examine the validity and demonstrate the performance of proposed windowed ( filtered ) fourier spectral scheme for conservation law systems .",
    "a large collection of standard linear and nonlinear benchmark problems @xcite , including the linear advection equation , 1d inviscid burgers equation , shock tube ( sod and lax ) problems , 1d shock - entropy interaction , 2d shock - entropy interaction , 2d shock - vortex interaction , 2d advection of an isentropic vortex and flow past a cylinder , are considered in the present study .",
    "some of these problems have periodic boundary conditions therefore the windowed fourier pseudospectral method will be applied directly . for problems",
    "whose boundary conditions are not periodic , we symmetrically double the computational domain in both @xmath11 and @xmath52 directions to compute the flux derivative .",
    "it is noted that the extension is necessary for constructing periodic problem feasible for the fourier spectral method .",
    "our filtering procedures , as described earlier , can be applied with general boundary conditions , such as dirichlet or neumann . in the appendix",
    ", we list the filter parameter @xmath27 used for each numerical example .",
    "we begin our numerical experiments with the scalar conservation law system , which is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a function of @xmath23 .",
    "it is generally believed that spectral methods are not very suitable for simple shock profiles and should not be used if one is interested primarily in the shock profiles rather than other detailed structures of the flow . in this study",

    "it contains the so - called contact discontinuity and is quite difficult to solve in hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "in particular , the interaction of two lines at @xmath68 and @xmath69 is difficult to resolve .",

    "the numerical results for these two problems are shown in fig .",
    "[ sod ] and fig .",
    "[ lax ] , respectively .",
    "we can see that the present method gives a good resolution in both cases .",
    "similar to all the methods depending on the numerical dissipation , the resolution for the linear degenerate contact discontinuity is slightly lower than that for the generic nonlinear shock wave .",
    "if combined with harten s artificial compression method , present spectral solver should have better resolution for the contact discontinuity .    _",
    "_ in this example , the interaction of an entropy wave of small amplitude with a mach 3 right - moving shock in a one - dimensional flow is investigated .",
    "the computational domain is taken as @xmath89 $ ] and the flow field is initialized with @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the amplitude and the wave number of the entropy wave before the shock .",
    "this problem is significant due to its relevance to the interaction of shock - turbulence .",
    "spectral methods , by nature of their high accuracy and negligible dispersive and dissipative errors , are ideally suited to the numerical study of turbulence and have already been widely applied . here",
    "we would like to argue the feasibility of the present spectral method to the shock - turbulence interaction .",
    "in our test , we vary the wavenumber of the pre - shock wave while keeping its amplitude unchanged ( @xmath93 ) . as the wavenumber increases , the problem becomes more and more challenging because the amplified high - frequency entropy waves after the shock are always mixed with spurious oscillations .",
    "as the wavenumber increases , it is very difficult to distinguish the high - frequency waves from the spurious oscillations . a low - order scheme may dramatically damp the transmitted high frequency waves .",
    "even some popular high - order schemes also encounter the difficulty in preserving the amplitudes of the entropy waves due to their excessive dissipation with a given mesh size .",
    "therefore , a successful shock - capturing method should be able to eliminate gibbs oscillation while capturing the shock and preserving the high - frequency entropy waves .    in our test",
    ", we let the shock move from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . for the purpose of comparison with the previous results ,",
    "we only give the results at the interval @xmath96 $ ] . also , in order to discharge the transient waves due to the non - numerical initial shock profile , we plot the length of the amplified entropy waves in the same manner as that in ref .",
    "furthermore , we must point out two nontrivial remarks for the following cases with different @xmath92 .",
    "one is that we have replotted the final results in a denser grid , otherwise the bounded strip will not be fully spanned due to the fact that no enough grid values locate near all the peaks /valleys of the wave .",
    "another is that we have used a local filter in order to eliminate the oscillations near the shock when we present final results after the computation .",
    "first , we consider @xmath97 . in this case , the computational domain is deployed with 513 grids points .",
    "such a mesh is suitable for the fourier spectral method .",
    "the numerical results of the amplitude of the entropy waves are shown in fig .",
    "[ shockentropy](a ) .",
    "it can be seen that the shock and the generated entropy waves are ideally captured .",
    "the entropy waves fully span the strip bounded by two solid lines at @xmath98 0.08690716 , which show the amplitude of the amplified entropy waves predicted by the linear analysis .",
    "since post - shock waves are monochromic , a simple calculation indicates the point per wavelength ( ppw ) value of these waves is 7.125 .",
    "such value is larger than the spectral resolution ( ppw=2.0 ) but it is much smaller than that obtained by most shock - capturing schemes .",
    "the transmitted waves suffer the similar smearing as the contact waves .",
    "the shock wave , on the contrary , is self - repairable due to its compression nature .",
    "this observation verified that the numerical dissipation needed for shock - capturing will degrade the resolution of the spectral method .",
    "it also verified that this degradation can be isolated and alleviated by the dsc - rsk filter .",
    "we next double the wave number @xmath92 up to 26 .",
    "a mesh of 513 grid points is not enough for simultaneous shock capturing and high - frequency wave resolving .",

    "in this work , we introduce the use of discrete singular convolution ( dsc ) filters in the fourier pseudospectral method ( fpm ) for the simulation of hyperbolic conservation law systems .",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) is used as the basic scheme , while dsc low - pass filters are used to suppress unphysical oscillations .",
    "the dsc filters are implemented in either the fourier domain or the physical domain , depending on the physical problem under consideration .",
    "the fourier domain implementation is easy and cost efficient , whereas the physical domain implementation allows more flexibility to handle some special boundary conditions . a sensor technique developed in the conjugate filter oscillation reduction ( cfor ) scheme @xcite",
    "is adopted in the present work to appropriately activate the dsc filter .",
    "the fourth - order runge - kutta scheme is utilized for the time integration .",
    "extensive numerical experiments are considered to validate the proposed approach and to demonstrate its usefulness .",
    "excellent numerical results are obtained for all problems examined .",
    "the dsc filters turn out to be very effective in removing the gibbs oscillations produced by the spectral approximation while maintaining a high accuracy .",
    "moreover , it is also highlighted that these filters can dramatically improve the stability of the spectral method for the long time integration .",
    "the main features of proposed method are the follows : + ( 1 ) the basic scheme , the fpm is of spectral accuracy , which is important for problems that require not only capturing shock waves , but also resolving fine flow structures .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the use of fft endows the method high efficience , which is desirable for large scale problems in science and engineering .",
    "+ ( 3 ) numerical dissipation of the dsc filters is adjustable for a given problem , which endows the proposed method the ability to handle problems that are sensitive to numerical dissipation .",
    "the interaction of turbulence and shock is arguably a problem of this kind .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the fourier domain algorithm can be regarded as a windowed fourier pseudospectral method for shock - capturing .",
    "the alternative use of the dsc filter in the physical domain makes the proposed method feasible to problems requires special boundary conditions , e.g. , reflective boundary condition .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the proposed scheme by - passes finding the characteristics which is required in many other shock - capturing schemes .",
    "+ ( 6 ) the use of the method in higher dimensions is straitforward .",
    "it is note that the state of art shock - capturing schemes , such as weno and central schemes , do not depend on any adjustable parameter . to make the proposed scheme robust and user friendly",
    ", future work will focus on developing sophisticated sensors so that the filter parameter will be chosen automatically for each given problem .",
