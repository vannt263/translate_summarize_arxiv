    "there is a common recognition today that electrochemical activity of a wide class of non - magnetic colloids of technical and biomedical interest is primarily determined by the electrostatics of internal nano - structures of an extremely involved molecular composition .",
    "this complexity calls for the development of admittedly idealized models of such nano - complexes providing a comprehensive insight into in - medium electrostatics of both conducting and dielectric nanosolutions .",
    "a well - known example is the macroscopic treatment of spherical nano - structures in globular polyelectrolytic biosolutions borrowing the idea of quasi - particles from the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory of weak electrolytes .",
    "as is known , the standard dh - theory ( and set of its modifications , e.g. [ 1,2 ] ) deals with completely ionized ( highly conducting ) solutions in which the ions are regarded as non - polarized free spherical charges .",
    "the basic explanatory device of dh - theory is the in - medium quasiparticle composed of a massive macro - ion surrounded by an atmosphere of light counterions .",
    "the central to this theory is the approximation of particle density in ionic atmosphere by boltzmann function with the energy factor depending on the potential of mean electrostatic field .",
    "the most striking outcome the dh - approach to electrostatics of electrolytes , relying on the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation for the potential of exterior coulomb ( electrostatic ) field of above quasiparticles , is that the solution of this latter equation provides proper account for the in - medium effect of electric field shielding [ 2 ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is not so clear for nanosolutions possessing properties of dielectric ( non - conducting ) liquids the sources of internal electric field in which are bound charges rather than free ones as is the case of electrolytes .",
    "the electrodynamics of continuous dielectric media teaches us that the local density of bound charges @xmath3 owe its origin to gradients of dielectric permittivity @xmath4 in the direction of local electric field @xmath5 , but the interrelation between this field and micro - composition of dielectric media remains less studied . in this paper",
    "we investigate this issue in the model of dielectric nanosolution whose micro - composition is dominated by spherically symmetric nano - complexes composed of massive counterions coagulated by cloud of polarized dipoles of solvent molecules . in what follows",
    "such nano - structures are dubbed by _",
    "dipolarions_. in so doing we focus on computing exterior fields for two kinds of such nano- complexes , namely ( i ) permanent dipolarion composed of macro - ion coated by atmosphere of polarized dipoles of polar molecules with constant ( field - independent ) intrinsic dipole moments , and ( ii ) field - induced dipolarion the atmosphere of which consists of molecules whose dipole moments are induced by field of macro - ion . before embarking on mathematical details of in - medium electrostatics of such nanosolution , it seems worth emphasizing that dipolarion is the electrically charged nano - complex , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 showing internal constitution of permanent dipolarions with a positive and a negative charges of central macro - ions .",
    "the effect of polarization of solvent molecules along the lines of central symmetric field of micro - ion consists in an effective shift of charge from center to the surface of the dipolarion with no change of the original sign of charge of micro - ion .",
    "thus , the physical nature of electric field shielding in dielectric nanosolutions with the above dipolarion micro - constitution is substantially different from that for dh - quasiparticles of electrolytes .",
    "this observation motivates the main purpose of this work which is to compute to exterior electric fields of dipolarions in dielectric nanosolution carrying information about the in - medium effect of electric field shielding . in the below presented calculations this effect",
    "is highlighted by difference between obtained analytic expressions for exterior fields of dipolarions and canonical formula for coulomb field of charged sphere immersed in a dielctric liquid composed of electrically passive , unpolarizable , molecules .",
    "the electrostatic state of an isotropic dielectric continuous medium is described by equations ( e.g. , [ 3 ] ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field of electric displacement , @xmath8 is the density of electric polarization - electric dipole moment per unit volume and @xmath9 stands for the electric permittivity of free space .",
    "the rightmost of ( [ e2.1 ] ) is the maxwell equation for the electrostatic field @xmath5 ( differential form of coulomb law ) and @xmath10 is the total density of electric charge which is a sum of the free charge density , @xmath11 , and bound charge density , @xmath3 . by definition",
    "these are @xmath12 as was mentioned , the main difference between dielectric liquids and electrolytes is that the former can be usually thought of as a non - conducting suspension composed of bound charges dissolved in a fluid matrix of electrically polarized molecules , whereas electrolyte is an electrically conducting solution ( of second type ) whose conductivity is attributed to the mobility of ions which are regarded as free ( non - bounded ) charges . taking this into account and putting @xmath13 , one has @xmath14 here @xmath5 stands for the internal electric mean field whose source is the bound - charge density charges which is formed from charges of both counterions and poles of molecular dipoles . in this work ,",
    "as was stated , we focus on a dielectric nanosolution whose internal electrification is determined by dipolarions - nano - structures composed of monopole charge of counterions surrounded by a cloud of radially polarized molecular dipoles forming dipolar atmospheres , having some features in common with ionic atmosphere of dh - qiasiparticle . bearing this mind",
    "we represent the macroscopic bound - charge density of dielectric nanosolution in the form @xmath15 where index @xmath16 labels counterions carrying the charge @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the effective particle density of bound charges associated with the ion of @xmath16-th type which takes into account polarization of molecular dipoles by field of given ion .",
    "the contribution of bound - charges of dipole - polarized molecules to the macroscopic bound - charge density of nanosolution can be incorporated in the above parametrization of @xmath3 by using of boltzmann function for @xmath18 with the energy factor describing polarization effect of ionic fields on dipole moment of molecules of solvent .",
    "namely , @xmath19 where @xmath4 is electric permittivity of solvent , @xmath20 is the number of dipole - polarized molecules of @xmath21-type having a dipole moment @xmath22 , which form the dipolar atmosphere surrounding the ion . in the last equation , by @xmath23",
    "is understood the effective particle density of ions in the the absence of dipolar polarization of solvent molecules , as it would be the case of dielectric liquid composed of ions dissolved in fluid matrix of electrically passive , unpolarizable , molecules ( i.e. , molecules which are non - polar and insensitive to fields of ions ) . equation ( [ e2.4 ] ) means , in fact , that dipolar atmospheres of counterions are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath24 which is high enough to approximate the average particle density of bound charges of dielectric solution in above fashion . with account of this",
    "we arrive at a highly non - linear equation of in - medium electrostatics @xmath25 describing electric field in dielectric nanosolution with account its dipolarion micro - composition . in this equation by @xmath26",
    "is understood the bound - charged density which would be in case of ions suspended in the solvent of unpolarizable molecules .",
    "adhering to the spirit of debye - hckel theory , we make the following approximation @xmath27 as a result , the equation of in - medium electrostatics of dipolarionic nanosolution takes the form @xmath28 this equation constitutes mathematical basis for below presented analysis of the electric field shielding in the dielectric nanosolution with the dipolarion micro - constitution .",
    "in the reminder , we focus on application of the equation ( [ e2.6 ] ) to electrostatics of in - medium dipolarions having a shape of sphere of radius @xmath29 in accord with the standard approach to the problem of electrostatic field inside and outside sphere , the interior , @xmath30 , and exterior , @xmath31 , fields should be computed from two equations @xmath32 supplemented by boundary conditions on the surface of dipolarion of radius @xmath29 . in the above equations @xmath33 is the in - medium parameter which accounts for the dipole polarization of solvent molecules from dipolar atmosphere by field of monopole charge of central micro - ion . as was noted in introduction",
    ", we are considering the two kinds of dipolarions distinguishing by type of solvent molecules forming its dipolar atmosphere .",
    "the first model belongs to aqua and aqua - like solutions composed of polar molecules of solvent , that is , molecules endowed with permanent dipole moments of constant magnitude , @xmath34 .",
    "the nano - complex of this type is referred to as a permanent dipolarion .",
    "the second model belongs to a case of dipolar atmosphere consisting of @xmath20 non - polar molecules whose dipole electric moments @xmath22 are induced by local fields @xmath5 of macro - ions : @xmath35 , where constant parameter @xmath36 is the molecular polarizability of solvent molecule of @xmath21-sort .",
    "the in - medium dipolarion of this type is referred to as a field - induced dipolarion . since",
    "our prime goal is the in - medium effect of electric field shielding , in what follows we focus on exterior fields of above dipolarions whose central symmetric shape suggests that the local fields have only one radial component @xmath37 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      taking into account the last remark presuming that @xmath38 , one finds that the radial component of exterior field of permanent dipolarion obey the liner equation @xmath39 with the help of substitution @xmath40 we arrive at equation for @xmath41 permitting the general solution @xmath42 as a result , for the radial component of external electrostatic field of permanent dipolarion we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total charge of dipolarion whose density accounts for the internal polarization of polar molecules by fields of central ion .",
    "the potential of this field is given by equations @xmath45 , \\quad { \\rm ei}(n , x)=\\int\\limits_1^{\\infty } \\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^n}\\,dt .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the exponential integral ( e.g. , [ 4 ] ) .",
    "special comment should be made regarding the obtained expression ( [ e3.6 ] ) for electric field of dipolarion whose exponential factor exhibits the in - medium effect of electric field shielding .",
    "this effect is controlled by parameter @xmath47 depending on characteristics of both counterions and molecules of solvent : the larger @xmath47 the smaller effect of shielding .",
    "also , it worth emphasizing that the magnitude of the shielding length @xmath47 is the in - medium parameter carrying information about all constituents of dielectric nanosolution , since depends upon bound - charged density of all counterions @xmath48 , electric permittivity @xmath4 and dipole moments of solvent molecules @xmath49 .",
    "the shielding of exterior field of permanent dipolarion is clearly demonstrated in fig.1 where we plot exterior field and potential as functions of distance from the dipolarion surface ( normalized to its radius ) computed at pointed out values of the shielding length @xmath47 .",
    "consider a model of field - induced dipolarion which might be appropriate to dielectric nanosolutions composed of non - polar molecules of solvent which are easily polarized , however , by fields of counterions : under the action of ionic field the molecules of dipolar atmospheres acquire a dipole electric moments which are proportional to the field of ion : @xmath50 , where @xmath21 labels the dipolar type of molecule .",
    "interestingly enough that the exterior electrostatic field of field - induced dipolarion is described by non - linear equation @xmath51 which can be solved analytically .",
    "however to avoid destructing attention to mathematical details of fairly tedious analytic computations ( which will be reported in separable paper ) , we present here the final result @xmath52 which can easily be verified by simple computation @xmath53 the exterior field and its potential can be represented in the form @xmath54 highlighting the effect of the field shielding which is regulated by parameter @xmath55 depending upon charges of macro - ions and electric polarizability of solvent molecules . here by @xmath44 is understood the total charge of field - induced dipolarion .",
    "it is seen that , unlike the exponential shielding of electric field of the permanent dipolarion , the dipolar atmosphere of field - induced dipolarion leads to the electric field shielding which is described by @xmath56 factor .",
    "the above characteristics can be conveniently represented via dimensionless parameter of the field shielding @xmath47 and distance ( normalized to the dipolarion radius ) @xmath57 which is measured from the surface of dipolarion @xmath58 in terms of these quantities , the radial component of external field @xmath59 and potential @xmath60 take the form @xmath61 the case of @xmath62 corresponds to the surface values of these quantities . in fig.2",
    ", we plot the radial component of exterior electric field and potential of the field - induced dipolarion as functions of @xmath63 computed at different values of parameter of shielding length @xmath47 .",
    "one sees , the smaller @xmath47 the less in - medium effect of the field shielding .",
    "the limiting case of @xmath64 corresponds to coulomb law for the potential and field of uniformly charged sphere .",
    "an understanding of macroscopic electrodynamics of non - conducting nanomaterials possessing dielectric and/or ferroelectric properties is important for their practical applications in current industrial and biomedical nanotechnologies .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] , an optical response of ferroelectric nanoparticles by resonant vibrations has been studied in the context of their potential utilization as biolabels .",
    "continuing this line of research , the purpose of this work was to find out theoretical framework providing meaningful discussion of electrochemical properties of dielectric nanosolution originating from dipolarions  positively and negatively charged nano - complexes composed of counterions coagulated by clouds of electric dipoles of solvent molecules . employing the standard equation of electrostatics for dielectric continuous media and using boltzmann distribution for the particle density of bound charges , we found that in - medium electrostatics of such nanosolutions can be conveniently described by equation for the intensity of internal field , rather than rather poisson - boltzmann equation for electrostatic potential lying at the base of the debye - hckel theory of electrolytes .",
    "the introduced equations are interesting in their own right and , first of all , due to their capability of consistent mathematical description and physical treatment of the in - medium effect of electric field shielding which is caused by the polarization of molecular dipoles of solvent by fields of counterions",
    ". this capability has been demonstrated by numerical analysis of obtained analytic solutions for exterior fields of two kinds of dipolarions . from current investigations of technical and biolectrolytes we know that the electrostatic fields and potentials of in - medium quasiparticles serve as the basic ingredients in computations of coefficients of electrochemical activity of these conducting liquids . in the meantime , this issue has not , to the best of our knowledge , been properly discussed in the context of dielectric liquids and nanosolutions and will be the subject of our forthcoming paper relying on the results presented in this work .",
