    "the anomalous transport induced by electromagnetic fields has been widely studied recently . in the presence of an axial chemical potential , a vector current will propagate parallel to an applied magnetic field led by triangle anomalies , which is the renowned chiral magnetic effect(cme)@xcite .",
    "although this effect was initially found in the deconfined phase , it may exist in the hadronic phase as well@xcite .",
    "analogous to cme , a vector chemical potential can generate an axial current along the magnetic field , which is the so - called chiral separation effect(cse)@xcite .",
    "these effects have been further derived from varieties of different approaches , including relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite , and lattice simulations@xcite .",
    "also they were analyzed in the strongly coupled plasmas through the ads / cft correspondences@xcite .",
    "however , in the sakai - sugimoto(ss ) model as a commonly used model for ads / qcd@xcite , cme may disappear when requiring both gauge - invariance and conservation of the vector current@xcite .",
    "for a recent review of cme / cse and related topics , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the effects are particularly important in the heavy ion experiments , where the charge separation could arise from the strong magnetic field produced from the colliding nuclei and non - vanishing chemical potentials in the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) . in light of cme / cse",
    ", it was proposed that the thermal fluctuations of the vector and axial chemical potentials in thermal plasmas can further result in density waves propagating along the magnetic field as the chiral magnetic waves(cmw)@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the dispersion relation of cmw was investigated in the framework of the ss model with zero chemical potentials .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the cmw could generate a chiral dipole and a charge quadrapole in qgp , which may contribute to the charge asymmetry of elliptic flow @xmath0 measured in the relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic)@xcite .",
    "further study of cmw in an expanding qgp can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the anomalous effects , the strong magnetic field also gives rise to profound phenomena such as the enhanced photon production @xcite , which could be crucial for the large elliptic flow observed in rhic @xcite and in the large hadron collider(lhc)@xcite , the production of heavy quarkonia@xcite , and the modified shear viscosity of qgp@xcite .",
    "in addition to the strong magnetic field , a strong electric field could be produced in heavy ion collisions as well .",
    "the strong electric field having the magnitude of @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the mass of pions could exist in the asymmetric collisions such as the au nucleus to the cu nucleus in early times@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electric field can be comparative to that of the magnetic field on the basis of event - by - event fluctuations even in the symmetric collisions@xcite .",
    "a novel phenomenon called chiral electric effect(cese ) has been proposed in @xcite , where an axial current can be produced parallel to the electric field in the presence of both vector and axial chemical potentials .",
    "the direct - current(dc ) conductivity of the axial charge was found to be proportional to the product of the axial chemical potential and the vector chemical potential in the weakly coupled qed with small chemical potentials compared to the temperature of the medium .",
    "such a relation was later verified in the strongly coupled scenario in the ss model@xcite . moreover , the relation is approximately hold even for large chemical potentials . unlike cme / cse , since cese",
    "is not contributed by the chern - simons(cs ) term related to the axial anomaly but only by the nonzero vector and axial chemical potentials , the axial current from cese in the ss model is well defined . besides , in ref.@xcite , the studies of electric conductivities of non - singlet currents in a weakly coupled qcd system with multi - flavors implies that the similar behavior of axial conductivities in small chemical potentials could also observed in qcd .",
    "similar to cmw , the density fluctuations may induce the propagating waves along the electric field as the chiral electric waves(cew)@xcite .",
    "in phenomenology , the combination of cme and cese could possibly generate quadrapole distribution of charge particles when the electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other as in the asymmetric collisions .",
    "it is thus imperative to further investigate cese and cew",
    ".    we will continue our study in @xcite to further explore the cese and cew with arbitrary chemical potentials . from the classical electrodynamics ,",
    "the presence of both an electric field and a magnetic field perpendicular to each other should yield a hall current perpendicular to both applied fields .",
    "since the cese is analogous to the normal transport process which is governed by the interaction between the chiral particles , we will find an axial hall current similar to the axial current parallel to the electric field in the absence of the axial anomaly .    in general",
    ", we analyze the cese , classical hall effect , and chiral hall effect(che ) in chiral systems in the presence of external electromagnetic fields and also investigate the propagating waves caused by the density fluctuations with arbitrary chemical potentials .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume that the interaction between the chiral particles dominates the topological effect and thus neglect the cme / cse .",
    "in addition , we will implement the ss model to compute the transport coefficients including the damping times , wave velocities , and diffusion constants of cew .    for convenience , we briefly summarize cme , cse , cese , che , cmw and cew in tab . [",

    ", we then generalize both the cmw and cew to the cases with arbitrary chemical potentials .",
    "also , we analyze the cew on the basis of the cese and che . in section [ ss_model ] , we review the setup of the ss model in a chiral symmetric phase at finite temperature with chemical potentials and a constant electric field perpendicular to a constant magnetic field , where we further derive the axial hall current . in section [ che_holography ]",

    "physically , @xmath34 is related to the interaction between particles . since",
    "when @xmath29 is too weak , the interaction from particles will give an effective force to each particles and the force will help to satisfy eq .",

    "quite different with above effects , the hall and chiral hall effects depends on interactions and can survive without topological effects and berry phase .",
    "the cese and che may have important implications for the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a system with only @xmath66 and @xmath67 quarks in the following discussion .",

    "for cme and cse , a finite @xmath43 is not necessary , since the cse will induce a finite @xmath43 with the evolution .",
    "nevertheless , to simplify the condition in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields , we ignore the detail of the axial charge distribution from cse and just assume there exists a net positive @xmath43 as an initial condition when we discuss cese and che .",
    "one can consider the net @xmath43 to be induced by cse or by fluctuations or topological transitions of qcd vacuum in each events .",
    "firstly , we will give a brief review to the scenario caused by the cme and cse .",
    "in the relativistic non - central heavy ion collisions , two nuclei collide with each other through the @xmath72 direction as the beam direction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] and a very strong magnetic field @xmath29 appears perpendicular to the reaction plane , which is at the @xmath19 direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : cse - and - cme ] . according to the cse , because of the nonzero net baryon chemical potential , the strong magnetic field will induce an axial current and a local axial chemical potential @xmath43 .",
    "for example , assuming the reaction plane is on the @xmath73 plane in fig.[fig : cartoon ] , in the @xmath74 or @xmath75 region , the cse will lead @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "when there exists a local axial chemical potential , the cme will give rise to the charge separation , where the positive - charged particles will be pushed away from the reaction plane as illustrated in the right panel of fig.[fig : cse - and - cme ] .",
    "these dynamical and reaction - plane - dependent fluctuations of electric charge is expected not to vanish when averaged over lots of events . a possible result from these effects",
    "is the charge asymmetry encoded by the @xmath76 difference of @xmath77@xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a small global axial chemical potential induced by fluctuations or topological transitions of qcd vacuum in each events .",
    "for example , as shown in fig.[fig : cese - and - cme ] , we assume there is a global @xmath70 in a certain event . in the cu+au collisions , because of geometric asymmetry of the nuclei , there will be a large electric field from au to cu in the early stage@xcite , e.g. as shown in fig.[fig : cese - and - cme ] , the @xmath21 field is along the @xmath78 direction . because of the normal electric conduction @xmath79 , the positive and negative charged particles will be dragged to the @xmath80 and @xmath81 region , respectively . however , since the cese yields @xmath82 , the right and left handed quarks will also be pushed to the @xmath80 and @xmath81 region , respectively . therefore , the electric field enhances the charge and chirality separation .",
    "now in @xmath80 region , there are more positive - charged particles and more right - handed particles , i.e. locally @xmath83 . while in @xmath81 region , there are more negative - charged particles and more left - handed particles , i.e. locally @xmath84 .",
    "now we can add the cme and cse to the system . as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : cese - and - cme ] , in the @xmath80 region , since @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 , the positive - charged and right - handed ( or negative - charged and left- handed ) quarks will move along ( or along the opposite direction of ) the @xmath29 field and accumulate in the @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) side . similarly , in the @xmath81 region , the opposite processes will occur because of @xmath88 . in @xmath74 sider of @xmath81 region",
    ", the positive - charged and right - handed particles will move along the opposite direction of the @xmath29 field .",
    "note that , initially there is the net @xmath68 after the collisions .",
    "therefore , after the evolution in @xmath74 side there will still be more positive - charged particles at @xmath80 region than negative - charged particles at @xmath81 region .",
    "eventually , the combinations of magnetic and electric fields might cause a quadrupole distribution at certain angle @xmath89 with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the hall and chiral hall effects are expected to play a role in such strong electric and magnetic fields .",
    "however , the dynamics evolution is very complicated and the quantitative predictions require numerical studies in hydrodynamics . here",
    ", we will only discuss some possible phenomena in a qualitative description .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect all other chiral effects expect hall and chiral hall effects . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hall - and - chiral ] , in heavy ion collisions , the fireball is approximately boost - invariant along the @xmath72 direction as the beam direction in fig.[fig : hall - and - chiral ] .",
    "since both magnetic and electric fields are at the transverse plane ( @xmath90 ) plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : hall - and - chiral ] , according to ( [ eq : hall_strong_b_01 ] ) and ( [ eq : power_counting_hall_strong_02 ] ) , the hall and chiral hall effects will only induce currents anti - parallel or parallel to the @xmath72 direction .",
    "for example , we assume there is a global net @xmath70 and @xmath68 in the qgp . since @xmath91 , the positive - charged particles will move anti - parallel to @xmath72 direction , while the negative - charged particles will move parallel to @xmath72 direction . from @xmath92",
    ", the chirality separation happens similarly .",
    "it will further causes the nontrivial charge distribution with rapidity .",
    "note that an axial hall current can be generated by the che even at @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , when combining the cese , cme , and che , we might find the difference in charge asymmetry of the flow coefficients @xmath94 of charged pions with different rapidity .",
    "for example , we could expect that the quadrapole distribution will be enhanced in the backward rapidity but reduced in the forward rapidity .    in the next section",
    ", we will study the propagating waves coming from the density fluctuations and the above effects , while we only consider the fluctuations of currents and then solve the linearized desperation relation and discuss all possible propagating modes .",
    "we will leave the numerical studies based on hydrodynamic simulations in the future .",
    "we firstly review the derivation of cmw from the cme and cse in the right - handed and left - handed ( r / l ) bases in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "however , we will consider the presence of nonzero chemical potentials and electric conductivities of the medium .",
    "the cme and cse along with the internal electric fields yield @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote the electric conductivities for right / left handed fermions and @xmath6 denotes a constant strong background magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations of magnetic fields from the charged particles could be neglected . for simplicity",
    ", we further consider a decoupled system , where the right - handed fermions do not interact with the left - handed fermions .",
    "the @xmath98 here represents an `` internal '' electric field , which may come from a charged medium .",
    "given that the right - handed fermions do not interact with left - handed fermions , we may assume that @xmath99 and @xmath100 depend on @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . by implementing the conservation equation @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105",
    ", we obtain @xmath106 we then introduce the fluctuations of the charge densities in r / l bases , @xmath107    inserting the static charge densities @xmath108 or @xmath109 back to ( [ waveeqrl0 ] ) and assuming @xmath97 and @xmath110 uniform , we can solve the charge densities directly , i.e. @xmath111 , with @xmath112 constant given by initial conditions .",
    "that implies the nonzero charge density will eventually damp out with the damping time @xmath113 , which was as well indicated in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time scale of the fluctuations @xmath114 or @xmath115 is required to be much smaller than the damping time @xmath116 .",
    "fortunately , we find in the following model used in sec .",
    "[ che_holography ] , the damping time scale is about a few @xmath117 .    by using the results in our previous study of the dc conductivities in holography in @xcite",

    "these values of the damping times are sufficient long to compare with the fluctuations we assumed here . in this case",
