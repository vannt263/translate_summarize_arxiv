    "it is well known that both stars and cold interstellar gas play an important role in the gravitational instability of galactic discs ( e.g. , lin & shu 1966 ; jog and solomon 1984a , b ; bertin & romeo 1988 , and references therein ) . the local stability criterion for two - component discs of stars and gas can be expressed in the same form as toomre s ( 1964 ) stability criterion , @xmath2 , provided that @xmath1 is redefined appropriately .",
    "bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) , elmegreen ( 1995 ) , jog ( 1996 ) , rafikov ( 2001 ) and shen & lou ( 2003 ) calculated the effective @xmath1 parameter as a function of the radial velocity dispersions and surface mass densities of the two components .",
    "shu ( 1968 ) , romeo ( 1990 , 1992 , 1994 ) and wiegert ( 2010 ) evaluated the stabilizing effect of disc thickness , which is usually neglected but significant .",
    "as galactic discs contain both stars and gas , the effective @xmath1 parameter is clearly more accurate and useful than toomre s @xmath1 .",

    "( 1994 ) showed that the radial profile of this parameter has a large impact on the dynamics and evolution of spiral structure in galaxies .",
    "the results of those comprehensive analyses are discussed further in the books by bertin & lin ( 1996 ) and bertin ( 2000 ) .",
    "the effective @xmath1 parameter is also a useful diagnostic for exploring the link between disc instability and star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , hunter et al .  1998 ; li et al .",

    "2008 ) . more applications and references are given below .",
    "wang & silk ( 1994 ) proposed a remarkably simple recipe for computing the effective @xmath1 parameter in the case of infinitesimally thin discs : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the stellar and gaseous toomre parameters .",
    "bertin ( private communication ) points out that such an approximation was already used by him , before the 1990s , for illustrating the efficiency of a small amount of cold gas to destabilize a disc ( see also bertin 1996 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) .",
    "jog ( 1996 ) pointed out that the wang - silk approximation is invalid since it results from an incorrect analysis . in spite of that",
    ", the wang - silk approximation has been used in several important contexts : star formation ( e.g. , martin & kennicutt 2001 ; boissier et al .",

    "2009 ) .    in spite of such a burst of applications ,",
    "there has been no attempt to assess how good the wang - silk approximation is . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate its accuracy by performing a rigorous comparative analysis ( see sect .",
    "besides , we introduce a new approximation for the effective @xmath1 parameter : simple , accurate and applicable to realistically thick discs ( see sects 2.2 and 2.3 ) .",
    "we also show how to use our effective @xmath1 parameter for measuring the stability level of galactic discs , and why such a diagnostic is more predictive than the classical toomre parameter ( see sect .",
    "the conclusions of our paper are drawn in sect .",
    "and @xmath5 are the stellar and gaseous toomre parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radial velocity dispersions of the two components .",
    "the shaded part of the @xmath8 plane is the two - phase region discussed in the text .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath9 has two minima inside this region , and one minimum outside it . the transition between the gaseous and stellar stability phases occurs for @xmath10 .",
    "this line intersects the boundaries of the two - phase region at @xmath11 , where the stability threshold is @xmath12 . ]",
    "wang & silk ( 1994 ) investigated the link between star formation and disc instability in galaxies .",
    "they reconsidered the two - fluid dispersion relation of jog & solomon ( 1984a ) , which is valid for infinitesimally thin discs of stars and gas , and found that the effective @xmath1 parameter can be approximated as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the stellar and gaseous toomre parameters .",
    "this approximation is appealing because it is as simple as the formula for the total resistance in a parallel circuit . to evaluate the accuracy of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we rewrite it as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 the local stability criterion , @xmath18 , translates into @xmath19 .",
    "this is of the same form as the local stability criterion found by bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) ; see also romeo ( 1985 ) .",
    "bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) determined the stability threshold @xmath20 numerically , starting from the same dispersion relation as wang & silk ( 1994 ) but without introducing further approximations .",
    "in contrast to @xmath21 , @xmath20 depends on two parameters : @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since @xmath24",
    ", we can easily express @xmath20 in terms of @xmath25 we can then compare @xmath26 with @xmath27 and evaluate the accuracy of the wang - silk approximation as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "let us first see how spiral galaxies populate the @xmath8 plane .",
    "we use the 12 nearby star - forming spirals analysed by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , namely ngc 628 , 2841 , 3184 , 3198 , 3351 , 3521 , 3627 , 4736 , 5055 , 5194 , 6946 and 7331 .",
    "these are galaxies with sensitive and spatially resolved measurements of kinematics , gas surface density and stellar surface density across the entire optical disc . for each galaxy of this sample , we compute the radial profiles @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and hence the track left by the galaxy in the @xmath8 plane . the result for the whole sample",
    "is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the data span a range of two orders of magnitude in @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so we show them using a log - log plot .",
    "the typical value of @xmath28 can be robustly estimated by computing the median of the data points along @xmath28 , which is @xmath32 .",
    "this value is comparable to that found in the solar neighbourhood ( @xmath33 ; see binney & tremaine 2008 , p.  497 ) , but is much smaller than that expected in high - redshift star - forming galaxies ( @xmath34 ; e.g. , burkert et al .  2010",
    "; krumholz & burkert 2010 ) .",
    "the median value of @xmath29 , @xmath35 , is close to unity .",
    "this suggests that , on average , stars and gas contribute equally to the gravitational instability of the disc .",
    "similar values of @xmath29 are found in the solar neighbourhood ( @xmath36 ; see binney & tremaine 2008 , p.  497 ) , and are also expected at high @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ; e.g. , burkert et al .  2010 ; krumholz & burkert 2010 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) . and @xmath39 , i.e.  the median values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 computed from the galaxy data of leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , for estimating the typical accuracy of the wang - silk approximation and of our approximation .",
    "this is meant to be a complement to the detailed error maps shown and discussed throughout the paper .",
    "we do not ` hint that the stability properties can be characterized by a median value of an effective @xmath1-parameter ' . ]",
    "last but not least , note that 20% of the data fall within the shaded part of the @xmath8 plane .",
    "this is the ` two - phase region ' of bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) , here shown using our parametrization and logarithmic scaling . in this region ,",
    "the contributions of stars and gas to the gravitational instability of the disc peak at two different wavelengths .",
    "if @xmath40 , then the gaseous peak is higher than the stellar one and gas will dominate the onset of gravitational instability .",
    "vice versa , if @xmath41 , then stars will dominate .",
    "these are the gaseous and stellar stability ` phases ' shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the rest of the parameter plane , the dynamical responses of the two components are strongly coupled and peak at a single wavelength .",
    "more information is given in sect .",
    "3.2.2 of romeo ( 1994 ) .    fig .",
    "2 shows the contour maps of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( left panel ) , and the error map of @xmath42 ( right panel ) .",
    "remember that @xmath43 denotes the stability threshold , i.e.  the value of @xmath4 above which the two - component disc is locally stable , while @xmath44 denotes the effective @xmath1 parameter .",
    "both stability thresholds are above unity and converge to @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "the first property means that a disc of stars and gas can be gravitationally unstable even when both components are separately stable , as is well known ( e.g. , lin & shu 1966 ) .",
    "the second property simply means that stars and gas act as a single component when they have the same radial velocity dispersion , so that @xmath47 . apart from satisfying those properties , the two stability thresholds are clearly different .",
    "look in particular at the contour levels 1.11.4 of @xmath20 .",
    "their slope changes abruptly across the line @xmath10 , revealing the existence of two stability phases .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraph , this is an important characteristic of two - component discs , which @xmath21 fails to reproduce . from a quantitative point of view , the error that affects @xmath42 is significant but below 50% ( see now the right panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "using the median values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 computed from the galaxy data of leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , @xmath32 and @xmath35 , one finds that the typical error is about 20% .",
    "remember , however , that a significant fraction of the data populate the two - phase region , where the error can be more than 40% .",
    "note also that the error is negative , which means that the wang - silk approximation underestimates the effective @xmath1 parameter systematically .",
    "let us now illustrate how to find a better approximation for @xmath1 .",
    "the first ingredient is to determine the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath43 as @xmath48 and @xmath46 .",
    "these are in fact the natural bounds of @xmath28 .",
    "a rigorous analysis was performed by romeo ( 1985 ) .",
    "his results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e.  in gas - dominated stability regimes , @xmath51 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath49 and @xmath52 ,",
    "i.e.  in star - dominated stability regimes , @xmath53 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath54 ,",
    "i.e.  in the limiting case of a one - component disc , @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath43 behaves asymptotically as a weighted sum of two terms : 1 and @xmath56 .",
    "note also that the weight factors change symmetrically as we move from case ( i ) to case ( iii ) : @xmath57 .",
    "such symmetry suggests that we should search for an approximation of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 as @xmath48 , and @xmath60 as @xmath46 .",
    "a further constraint on @xmath61 follows from the fact that the original system of fluid and poisson equations remains unaltered if we interchange the stellar and gaseous components .",
    "( 4 ) must then be invariant under the transformation @xmath62 , @xmath63 and hence @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the value of @xmath5 above which the two - component disc is locally stable .",
    "invariance requires that @xmath66 .",
    "a simple function that satisfies this requirement and matches the asymptotic behaviour above is @xmath67 since @xmath44 , eqs ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) lead us to the following approximation for the effective @xmath1 parameter : @xmath68 @xmath69 our approximation is almost as simple as the wang - silk approximation [ eq .  ( 1 ) ] , but differs from that in one important respect : it gives less weight to the component with larger @xmath1 .",
    "the weight factor @xmath70 depends symmetrically on the radial velocity dispersions of the two components , and is generally small .",
    "to evaluate the accuracy of our approximation , we compare @xmath71 with @xmath27 and compute the relative error @xmath72 as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as we did for the wang - silk approximation .",
    "3 shows that @xmath43 works well in the whole parameter space ( see left panel ) .",
    "note in particular how successfully our approximation reproduces the gaseous and stellar stability phases for @xmath73 .",
    "3 also shows that @xmath1 overestimates the effective stability parameter , but the error is well below 10% even inside the two - phase region ( see right panel ) .",
    "the error can be reduced further by fine - tuning the weight factor , but the approximation will no longer be consistent with the asymptotic behaviour of the stability threshold .          as pointed out in sect .  1 ,",
    "the stabilizing effect of disc thickness is usually neglected but significant . in this section , we show that our approximation can easily be modified so as to take this effect into account .",
    "romeo ( 1992 ) investigated the gravitational instability of galactic discs taking rigorously into account two factors : ( i ) their vertical structure at equilibrium ; ( ii ) the coupling between scale height , @xmath74 , and vertical velocity dispersion , @xmath75 , in the stellar and gaseous layers .",
    "he calculated the effective @xmath1 parameter both as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and as a function of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "he also discussed the advantages of using @xmath78 and @xmath79 as input quantities .",
    "this effective @xmath1 parameter has been studied further by wiegert ( 2010 ) .",
    "hereafter we will denote it with @xmath80 .",
    "let us now illustrate how to find a simple and accurate approximation to @xmath80 . in the infinitesimally thin case",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( 6 ) ] , the local stability level of the disc is dominated by the component with smaller @xmath1 .",
    "the contribution of the other component is weakened by the @xmath70 factor , which is generally small .",
    "this suggests that the effect of thickness can be estimated reasonably well by considering each component separately .",
    "romeo ( 1994 ) analysed this case in detail .",
    "the effect of thickness is to increase the stability parameter of each component by a factor @xmath81 , which depends on the ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersion : @xmath82 eq .",
    "( 8) can be inferred from fig .",
    "3 ( top ) of romeo ( 1994 ) and applies for @xmath83 , which is the usual range of velocity anisotropy . to approximate @xmath80 , use then eq .",
    "( 6 ) with @xmath4 and @xmath5 replaced by @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is our effective @xmath1 parameter for realistically thick discs , @xmath70 is given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) tells us that the local stability level of the disc is now dominated by the component with smaller @xmath90 .",
    "the contribution of the other component is still suppressed by the @xmath70 factor .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the error map of @xmath87 for a galactic disc with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the corresponding two - phase region ( wiegert 2010 ) .",
    "note that the error is below 15% even inside this region , which confirms the high accuracy of our approximation in this more realistic context .",
    "what about the accuracy of the wang - silk approximation ?",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "4 shows that the relative error @xmath93 is much larger than ours , and can be well above 50% inside the two - phase region .          in this section ,",
    "we show how to use our effective @xmath1 parameter for measuring the stability level of galactic discs , and why such a diagnostic is more predictive than the classical toomre parameter .",
    "we consider the same sample of spiral galaxies as in sect .",
    "2.1 , and refer to leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for a detailed description of the data and their translation into physical quantities . for each galaxy , we compute the radial profile of our effective @xmath1 parameter , @xmath87 , using eq .",
    "we adopt @xmath94 , as was assumed by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and @xmath92 , as is natural for a collisional component .",
    "we also compute the radial profile of the gaseous toomre parameter , @xmath5 , which is the traditional diagnostic used for predicting star formation thresholds in galaxies ( e.g. , quirk 1972 ; kennicutt 1989 ; martin & kennicutt 2001 ; schaye 2008 ; elmegreen 2011 ) .",
    "5 shows @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the whole galaxy sample . note that @xmath5 spans a much wider range of values than @xmath87 at any given @xmath97",
    "this is true even at distances as large as the optical radius , @xmath98 , where @xmath5 is supposed to be a reliable diagnostic .",
    "a similar fact was noted by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , using an effective @xmath1 parameter that neglects the stabilizing effect of disc thickness ( jog 1996 ; rafikov 2001 ) . why are @xmath5 and @xmath87 so weakly correlated across the entire optical disc ?",
    "( 9 ) helps us to clarify this point .",
    "it tells us that the value of @xmath87 is dominated by the gaseous component if @xmath99 , and by the stellar component if @xmath100 . in the right panel of fig .  5",
    ", we have colour - coded the data so as to show whether @xmath99 or vice versa .",
    "it turns out that in 92% of the cases the value of @xmath87 is dominated by the stellar component .",
    "gas dominates the stability level only in 8% of the cases .",
    "this is why @xmath5 and @xmath87 are so weakly correlated .",
    "this result illustrates ( i ) how important it is to consider both gas and stars when measuring the stability level of galactic discs , and ( ii ) the strong advantage of using our effective @xmath1 parameter as a stability diagnostic .",
    "* the approximation of wang & silk ( 1994 ) [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] underestimates the effective @xmath1 parameter .",
    "the error is typically 20% , but can be as large as 40% or more if @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in this case , the gaseous and stellar components should contribute separately to the gravitational instability of the disc ( bertin & romeo 1988 ) .",
    "but such dynamical decoupling is difficult to approximate because it involves two stability regimes , one dominated by the gas and the other dominated by the stars , and because there is a sharp transition between the two ` phases ' .",
    "so it is not strange that the wang - silk approximation becomes less accurate when @xmath101 and @xmath103 . *",
    "our approximation [ eq .  ( 6 ) ] overestimates the effective @xmath1 parameter , but the error is less than 9% and typically as small as 4% . the accuracy and simplicity of our approximation result from a rigorous analysis , which takes into account the stability characteristics of the disc as well as the symmetries of the problem .",
    "* we provide a simple recipe for applying our approximation to realistically thick discs [ see eq .",
    "the ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersion is usually 0.5 for the stars and 1 for the gas . in this case ,",
    "our approximation is in error by less than 15% , whereas the wang - silk approximation can be in error by more than 50% .",
    "note also that the effective @xmath1 parameter is 2050% larger than in the infinitesimally thin case .",
    "thus the effect of thickness is important and should be taken into account when analysing the stability of galactic discs .",
