    "during the past several years , there has been considerable excitement about the possibility of the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( d@xmath0c ) in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic scenario is as follows : in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision some region thermalizes at a temperature above the chiral restoration temperature .",
    "if the system cools sufficiently rapidly back through the transition temperature , the region will remain in a chiral restored phase .",
    "however , this phase is unstable ; small fluctuations in any chiral direction ( @xmath8 ) will grow exponentially .",
    "this can create regions where the pion field has macroscopic occupation . it should be stressed that this scenario is not derivable directly from the underlying theory of qcd and contains a number of untested dynamical assumptions , principally that the cooling is rapid .",
    "thus the failure of the system to form a d@xmath0c can not be used to rule out that the system has reached the chiral restoration temperature . on the other hand , observation of the formation of a d@xmath0c would be clear evidence that the phase transition had been reached .    unfortunately , since the scenario is not derived directly from a well - defined theory , it is difficult to know precisely what constitutes observation of a d@xmath0c .",
    "assuming the system forms a single large domain of d@xmath0c containing a large number of pions there should be clear signatures . in the first place , one expects an excess in the number of low @xmath3 pions produced .",
    "they would be at low @xmath3 since , by hypothesis , the region is large so the characteristic momentum is small ; the excess would be measured relative to a purely statistical thermal distribution .",
    "such a signal has the advantage of working even if multiple regions of d@xmath0c form provided each region is large enough so the characteristic momentum is sufficiently small to provide a discernible signal over the thermal background .",
    "such a signal is not decisive since one could imagine some other collective low energy effects which produce low @xmath3 pions .",
    "a much stronger signal of a single large domain of d@xmath0c has been proposed . since the pions formed in a d@xmath0c",
    "are essentially classical they form a coherent state .",
    "the coherent state has some orientation in isospin space ( or more precisely the system is a quantum superposition of coherent states with different orientations and particular correlations to the isospin of the remainder of the system @xcite ) .",
    "in essence all of the pions in the domain are pointing in the same isospin direction .",
    "provided the total number of pions in the domain is large , this implies that the distribution of the ratio of neutral to total pions in the domain is given by @xcite @xmath9 where r is the ratio of the number of @xmath10 s in the d@xmath0c divided by the total number of pions and @xmath11 is the probability .",
    "the derivation of @xmath11 is quite simple and will be discussed below .",
    "the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ pofr ] ) is qualitatively distinct from a purely statistical distribution in which the emission of charged and neutral pions is uncorrelated .",
    "the distribution from uncorrelated emissions in the infinite particle number limit approaches a delta function at @xmath12 . for finite ( but large )",
    "particle number the statistical distribution is narrowly peaked about 1/3 with a variance , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number of pions . since these two distributions are so radically different one should in principle have a very clear signal if a single region of d@xmath0c where to form in heavy ion reactions and if the pions from the d@xmath0c are kinematically separated from other pions in the system .",
    "the dramatic nature of the preceding signature is based in large measure on the assumption that a single large domain of d@xmath0c is formed . _ a priori _ this seems rather unlikely for the following reason : if a large region of the system starts in a hot chirally restored phase and then rapidly cools through the phase transition , then there will be a large region which is unstable against growth of the pion field .",
    "presumably , this happens as a `` seed '' fluctuation in a small region which rapidly grows .",
    "it takes a time of at least @xmath15 for information about the formation of the domain to propagate a distance @xmath16 .",
    "however during the time this fluctuation is growing out to @xmath16 , the pion field at @xmath16 has been sitting in an unstable situation .",
    "the characteristic time it can remain in this unstable configuration is @xmath17 , the exponential growth time .",
    "if the information about the initial seed does not reach @xmath16 is a time comparable to @xmath17 the region near @xmath16 will likely begin its own exponential growth but in a chiral direction uncorrelated from the initial growth .",
    "thus , one expects domains of characteristic size @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the effect of multiple domains on the @xmath1 distribution is fairly clear : it will tend to wash out the signal .",
    "if a large number of domains form and the pions emerging from different domains can not be distinguished kinematically it is clear from the central limit theorem that the @xmath1 distribution will approach a normal distribution .",
    "this normal distribution may be distinguished from the normal distribution arising from uncorrelated emission ; the case of multiple domains of d@xmath0c will have a substantially larger variance .",
    "unfortunately , there is an important practical limitation which makes it difficult to exploit the @xmath1 distribution as a signature . even under the most optimistic of scenarios ,",
    "the total number of pions coming from d@xmath0c s will be a small fraction of the total number of pions .",
    "if one includes all pions produced in the reaction , the signal from the pions from the d@xmath0c will presumably be overwhelmed .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to use kinematic consideration to enhance the contributions coming from the d@xmath0c . in particular , it is sensible to study the @xmath1 distribution for a sample restricted to low @xmath3 pions only . in any scenario where the d@xmath0c is well defined , _",
    "i.e. _ , the occupation number is large is likely to require a moderately large regions of d@xmath0c and the characteristic momentum spread in the d@xmath0c will be fixed by the inverse size of the region .",
    "thus one expects d@xmath0cs to preferentially produce moderately low @xmath3 pions .",
    "( one also should restrict the pions in the distribution to a moderately narrow rapidity window ) .    as an experimental matter",
    ", it should be relatively straightforward to cut on the momentum of the charged pions to select low @xmath3 pions in a given rapidity window .",
    "for neutral pions , however , it is not a simple matter .",
    "the neutral pions will decay in flight and will ultimately be detected as photons . if one is simply interested in the overall @xmath1 distribution , without cuts , and if the detected photons come predominately from @xmath19 decays then one can use the @xmath20 as a surrogate for @xmath21 .",
    "recent experimental searches have exploited this strategy@xcite . however , in order to study the @xmath1 distribution in a limited kinematical region it is necessary to reconstruct the @xmath19 momenta from the observed photons in order to make kinematical cuts on the @xmath19 momenta .",
    "since the number of neutral pions per event is large , the reconstruction of neutral pion momenta is likely to be a formidable task .",
    "this raises the following interesting question : _ can one find a signature for the presence of regions of d@xmath0c of essentially the same quality as the @xmath1 distribution but which does not require the measurement of neutral pions ? _    on the other hand ,",
    "even if one succeeds in reconstructing the neutral pions so that a low @xmath3 cut can be applied , the noise may still be severe , as both the signal and the noise peak at @xmath12 .",
    "so it is highly desirable to have some other cuts to further suppress the noise due to incoherently emitted pions .",
    "this raises another question : _ can one construct additional cuts to further enhance the signal - to - noise ratio ? _    in this paper , we will provide answers to both questions raised above .",
    "for the first question , we will show in sec .",
    "ii that the distribution of the number of charged pions ( in a kinematically limited region ) contains essentially the same information about d@xmath0c formation as the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "this should greatly aid in searches for d@xmath0c formation .",
    "we also discuss additional information that can be inferred if @xmath19 s can be reconstructed .",
    "in particular , we show that the distribution of the total number of pions ( in a limited kinematic region ) provides a means to distinguish d@xmath0c formation from other hypothetical mechanisms for the production of a pion coherent state . then in sec .",
    "iii , we will suggest cuts which may dramatically enhance the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we study the conditional probability distribution of @xmath1 given only for the events in which the @xmath2 pions with the lowest @xmath3 are all neutral , and we will show that the expectation value of @xmath1 is shifted away from @xmath5 . since incoherent emission will result in a very narrow peak around @xmath12 , any such shifts should be easily observable .",
    "moreover , one can make successive cuts by increasing the value of @xmath2 , and enhance the signal in each successive step .",
    "we believe these signatures will be useful in the searches for d@xmath0c formation in rhic and lhc .",
    "in this section , we study the distribution of the number of charged pions produced from a d@xmath0c .",
    "we show that it contains essentially the same information about d@xmath0c formation as the distribution of @xmath1 , and the distribution will be much wider in the presence of d@xmath0c formation than otherwise .",
    "this is of significance since it provides a signature which avoids the experimentally challenging task of reconstructing neutral pions .",
    "we begin by studying an overly simple model and in subsequent subsections we will generalize our results to more realistic scenarios . in this simplified situation",
    "we assume that in every collision a single large domain of d@xmath0c is formed with a large particle number .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the field strength and spatial distribution of this domain do not vary event by event , and that the pions produced in the d@xmath0c are kinematically completely distinguishable from all other pions in the system ( including those pions produced from `` @xmath22 s ''  _",
    "i.e. _ , fluctuations in the @xmath23 directions ) .",
    "finally , we will assume that both isospin violating effects and explicit chiral symmetry breaking are negligible .    by hypothesis",
    ", the region of d@xmath0c contains many particles and is essentially classical in nature . to simplify discussion",
    "we will adopt the usual convention of describing the physics in terms of the degrees of freedom in a linear sigma model with o(4 ) symmetry , _ i.e. _ , @xmath22 and @xmath24 rather than directly in terms of the qcd degrees of freedom .",
    "we wish to stress , however , that we are not relying on the detailed dynamics of any particular variant of the @xmath22 model .",
    "since a d@xmath0c has macroscopic pion occupation numbers , it is tempting to describe it as a coherent state in the o(4 ) chiral space as in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in a generic heavy ion collision , the d@xmath0c ( if produced ) in the interior of the fireball will be quantum mechanically correlated with the high momentum emission at the edge of the fireball @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the low @xmath3 part of the physical state is not a pure state and is more appropriately described by a density matrix @xmath25 .",
    "for example , when explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to non - zero quark masses are ignored , a chirally restored state would be described by the density matrix @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and for the physical vacuum , @xmath28 where the non - zero expectation value of @xmath22 reflects that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "now we are ready to study d@xmath0c states @xmath29 , where the three angles describe the orientations of the d@xmath0cs in the o(4 ) chiral space . with the notation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is any operator , a d@xmath0c state is characterized by the following relations .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is independent of the angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 but can depend on space and time .",
    "the number operators for neutral and charged pions are @xmath37 and one can easily find their expectation values , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath39 can be factorized into the following form .",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath36 can take on arbitrary values .",
    "in other words , the expectation value @xmath42 measures the total number of @xmath43 s produced by the d@xmath0c if fully oriented in a pionic direction . in general , @xmath42 depends on the dynamical details of the d@xmath0c , such as its probability distribution in position or momentum spaces .",
    "the geometrical factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 will be called the neutral and charged proportions respectively , and they take the following forms . @xmath46",
    "note that @xmath42 does not depend on the orientation angles @xmath47 while @xmath48 do not depend on the dynamical details of the d@xmath0c .",
    "equation ( [ fac ] ) represents that both expectation values @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related to @xmath42 , and hence to each other , up to geometrical factors @xmath48 .",
    "actually the relationship goes deeper than that : the probability distributions of the number of neutral and charged pion produced , denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , can both be expressed in terms of the same distribution @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 notice that @xmath53 does not depend on the angles , and all the angular dependences in @xmath55 come from the geometrical factors @xmath48 .",
    "one can easily see that the above relation implies eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) , and also the following relation on the higher moments : @xmath56 with @xmath57    the probability distribution @xmath53 determines the distributions of neutral and charged pions produced from a d@xmath0c with a given orientation ( as described by the angles @xmath58 ) in the o(4 ) chiral space .",
    "let s recall that the probability distributions of the numbers of neutral or charged pion incoherently emitted in a heavy ion collision are poisson ",
    "gaussian , which have narrow peaks . to quantify the narrowness of a distribution , it is useful to define the _ deviance _ @xmath59 $ ] of a distribution of variable @xmath31 such that @xmath60 ) \\langle x \\rangle^2 , \\qquad \\hbox{or }   \\qquad ( \\delta x)^2 \\equiv \\langle x^2 \\rangle - \\langle x \\rangle^2   = \\delta[x ] \\langle x \\rangle^2.\\ ] ] for a poisson  gaussian distribution , @xmath61 = 1/\\langle n \\rangle \\to 0 \\quad \\hbox{when $ \\langle n \\rangle \\to   \\infty$}.\\ ] ] if the distribution @xmath53 is wide ( _ i.e. _ , with non - zero deviance in the large @xmath42 limit ) , the fluctuations in the numbers of coherently emitted neutral or charged pions will be much larger than the case of incoherent emission . as a result ,",
    "substantial deviances in the number of neutral or charged pions produced may signify d@xmath0c formation . unfortunately",
    ", the form of @xmath53 depends on the dynamical details of the d@xmath0c and is extremely model - dependent .",
    "various forms of coherent states and density matrices have been motivated by different theoretical considerations @xcite and lead to various forms of @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , the well - studied glauber coherent state @xcite also give a poisson ",
    "gaussian @xmath53 and hence negligible deviances in the pion numbers in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "so it may seem impossible to determine whether d@xmath0cs are formed by studying the fluctuations in the number of neutral or charged pions produced .",
    "however , recall that the above discussion presumes we have a d@xmath0c with a definite orientation in chiral space , _ i.e. _ , definite values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in d@xmath0c formation , however , the orientation is randomly generated , and the relevant object of study is an density matrix with some appropriate probability distribution functions for the angles , which we will now proceed to study .",
    "the above analysis shows that , _ for each set of orientation angles @xmath47 , _ the distributions of @xmath63 are normal .",
    "however , since the orientation is randomly generated in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , one can not predict @xmath47 . on the other hand , since we are neglecting explicit chiral symmetry breaking , the system is equally probable to point in any direction in chiral space .",
    "moreover , since by hypothesis we are in a semiclassical situation ( large @xmath42 ) , it is legitimate to work with probabilities rather than amplitudes . using the technology of ref .",
    "@xcite , the probability distribution in the angular variables is given by the unit measure : @xmath64 and the relevant density matrix is @xmath65 one can use eq .",

    ", we have constructed signatures for d@xmath0c formation in heavy ion collisions which do not require counting the number of neutral pions .",

    "both methods make use of the fact that all the pions in a d@xmath0c are aligned in the o(4 ) chiral space , and hence also in the o(3 ) isospace .",
    "this leads to a larger fluctuation in the number of charged pions produced than the case where all the pions are independently emitted . as a result",
    ", one can look for signatures for d@xmath0c formation from charged pion data only .",
    "the alignment in isospace also suggests that , if the `` first @xmath2 pions '' are all neutral , the remaining pions are also much more likely to be neutral than otherwise . by making cuts accordingly",
    ", one can greatly enhance the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we expect these methods will be useful in future searches for signatures of d@xmath0c formation in rhic and lhc .      99 i.v .",
