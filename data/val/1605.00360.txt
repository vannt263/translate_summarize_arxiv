    "@xmath0sc is short - lived , then no corresponding excitation of @xmath0sc will occur through such a cosmic ray process .",
    "generally people accepted that cas a was formed by the explosion of a massive star progenitor ( possible type ib ) , a 16 single star ( chevalier & oishi 2003 ) to a wolf - rayet ( wr ) remnant of a very massive ( @xmath62 ) precursor ( fesen & becker 1991 ) .",
    "the standard spherical explosion models ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ; limongi & chieffi 2003 ) predict the @xmath0ti yield below @xmath63 , which contradicts with the observational constraints .",
    "since in the standard models of core - collapse supernova explosions , @xmath0ti and @xmath64ni are co - produced during the first stages of the explosion , the high @xmath0ti may require that cas a should be brighter due to a larger product of @xmath64ni .",
    "there exist some indications that its explosion energy was about @xmath65 ergs ( laming & hwang 2003 ) , higher than the canonical value of @xmath66 ergs .",
    "the other possibility is that the explosion of cas a could be intrinsically asymmetric . and the sensitivity of the @xmath0ti production to the explosion energy and asymmetries ( nagataki et al .",
    "1998 ) may explain the higher @xmath0ti/@xmath64ni ratio compared to standard spherical explosion models .",
    "this asymmetric explosion scenario is also supported by some observational evidence in the x - ray emitting ejecta of cas a ( vink 2004 ; hwang et al .",
    "2004 ; hwang & laming 2012 ) .",
    "the recent direct imaging observations of the @xmath0ti emission in cas a suggested an intermediate asymmetry in this core - collapse supernova ( grefenstette et al .",
    "2014 ) : the @xmath0ti is extended along the jet axis seen in x - rays ( hwang et al . 2004 ) .",
    "therefore cas a may be a very special case of supernova explosions in the galaxy , and produced by an asymmetric and/or a relatively more energetic explosion .",
    "the non - thermal emissions from radio to x - ray bands in supernova remnants are generally believed to be produced by the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons accelerated in the remnant shocks .",
    "based on the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) theory , the produced synchrotron radiation spectrum shows a cutoff energy around a few kev .",
    "the present observed hard x - ray emission by ibis in cas a has a cutoff around a few kev , but the emission beyond the cutoff energy shows a power - law extended up to 220 kev , which is inconsistent with the dsa models .",
    "recently zirakashvili & aharonian ( 2007 ; 2010 ) investigated the spectral shape of the shock - accelerated electrons subject to synchrotron cooling in the context of dsa theory , then they provided useful approximations for the subsequent synchrotron spectral shape , which is a slowly decreasing function other than sharp cutoff .",
    "we use this approximation ( eq .",
    "37 in zirakashvili & aharonian 2007 ) to fit the data points from the radio to hard x - ray bands observed in cas a ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this slow function can well fit the data points from radio to x - ray bands up to 70 kev , however , the data points above 80 kev derived by ibis can not be described by the approximation .",
    "indeed the slower decrease at higher energy band ( hinted in fig .",
    "2 ) may suggest the hardening spectral component at high energy .        what is the physical origin of the non - thermal emission from 80  220 kev ?",
    "cas a is thought to be produced by a type ii explosion , then after the explosion , a neutron star or black hole should be left in the center . in the center of the remnant",
    ", a compact source is discovered in the first light observations of chandra x - ray observatory ( tanabraum 1999 ) .",
    "further deep observations find the spectrum of the point source in the band of 0.5 5 kev can be well fitted by a black body of @xmath67 kev ( pavlov et al . 2000 ; chakrabarty et al . 2001 ) , which is consistent with the standard neutron star cooling .",
    "this spectrum is also explained by the fallback accretion model into a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "if we assume the compact object could be a young normal pulsar , the power - law fit can obtain a photon index of @xmath43 ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ) which is much softer than other known young pulsars ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "could the possible hard x - ray emission from the compact object explain the observed hard x - ray flux ?",
    "thermal radiation models from the neutron star cooling or fallback accretion can not produce the non - thermal emission above 80 kev , so we only consider the possible origin of an active pulsar for the point source in cas a. the soft x - ray flux of the point source in cas a is very weak , with @xmath69 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 in the range of 1 5 kev ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "if the source has a power - law emission with the photon index of @xmath70 , the hard x - ray flux attributed by the pulsar candidate is only at the level of @xmath71 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 above 80 kev , much lower than the total observed flux in cas a. the pulsar component could not significantly contribute to the non - thermal emission above 80 kev , except that we assume the photon index of non - thermal emission from the pulsar candidate in cas a changing from 3 below 5 kev to around 1 above 10 kev .",
    "however , the hard spectrum of the photon index around 1 is not consistent with the observed non - thermal emission above 80 kev .",
    "in addition , nustar has not detected the compact source in the range of 3  79 kev ( grefenstette et al .",
    "2014 ) , suggesting that the compact source can not become brighter above 5 kev .",
    "thus , the compact source will not contribute to the non - thermal emission from 80  220 kev significantly . in the following part",
    ", we assume that the emission is due to synchrotron radiation from the remnant shock , and discuss the requirement for producing 100-kev emission .",
    "the acceleration of electrons in the remnant shock suffers from radiative energy loss .",
    "the maximum synchrotron photon energy where the electron acceleration and synchrotron cooling times are equal is @xmath72 ( e.g. , katz & waxman 2006 ) , where @xmath73 is the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the bohm diffusion one , and @xmath74 is the shock velocity . as the bulk velocity of the shock in cas a is @xmath75 ( e.g. , fesen et al . 2006 ; grefenstette et al .",
    "2014 ) , the cutoff energy is at a few kev for the bohm limit @xmath76 .",
    "the cas a spectrum is consistent with a turnover around a few kev .",
    "however , by the dsa theory the spectrum beyond the cutoff is an exponential decay ( e.g. , zirakashvili & aharonian 2007 ) , inconsistent with our result at @xmath77 kev .",
    "since the acceleration is not expected to be faster than bohm limit ( @xmath78 ) , the 100-kev emission can not be produced by the bulk remnant shock of cas a.    one may argue that the postshock magnetic field may not be uniform .",
    "there may be stronger magnetic field distributed in smaller spatial region .",
    "thus , when the electrons are sampling the high magnetic field region they emit higher energy synchrotron photons .",
    "since the synchrotron photon frequency goes with magnetic field as @xmath79 , the @xmath80kev emission compared to a few kev cutoff needs a magnetic field contrast of @xmath81 times , which may be too large to imagine .",
    "the other option is that the magnetic field increases downstream with the distance away from the shock front , so that electrons may produce higher energy photons when flowing downstream .",
    "but so far there is no support from theory and observation for magnetic field increasing downstream .",
    "one may also expect that if the relativistic electrons that are responsible to the 100-kev synchrotron emission is not produced by shock acceleration , then it is possible to avoid the limit to the synchrotron photon energy .",
    "a possible high energy electron origin is the hadronic process that the shock - accelerated cosmic rays interact with the background medium and produce pions which decay quickly into secondary electrons ( or positrons ) , as well as neutrinos and photons , i.e. , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . because of the connection between the secondary electrons and photons",
    ", there should be also a connection between the secondary photons and the electrons - emitted synchrotron radiation . because the produced @xmath84 s , @xmath85 s , and @xmath86 s have similar numbers and energy , and the secondaries approximately share the primary energy , we have @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and hence @xmath89 . since the synchrotron photon energy is @xmath90 and the electrons",

    "so the radiation at 100 kev is impossible to be of secondary electron origin .",
    "a possible model for the hard x - ray emission may be asymmetrical explosion where the ejecta velocity is angularly dependent , and the 100-kev emission can be produced by the highest velocity ejecta . for the emission cutoff to reach @xmath94 kev , the required ejecta velocity is about @xmath95 with @xmath76 .",

    "the @xmath0ti lines are detected with a significance level of @xmath141 . the mean @xmath0ti line flux at 78 kev is @xmath1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 which is consistent with the previous measurements .",
    "the derived @xmath0ti yield from the explosion of cas a is @xmath57 according to the present measurements .",
    "cas a is detected in hard x - ray bands up to @xmath13 220 kev .",
    "in addition , the spectrum from 20  220 kev shows a single power - law feature without cutoff . this spectral feature ( specially non - thermal emission above 80 kev )",
    "is inconsistent with the present dsa models . the central compact object in cas",
    "a could not contribute to the non - thermal hard x - ray emission significantly .",
    "this non - thermal component above 80 kev should come from the synchrotron radiation in the shock of the remnant .",
    "we have discussed the possible physical origin of the non - thermal emission above 100 kev from the shock waves .",
    "there may exist a higher magnetic field in some small region in the remnant or the magnetic field might increase downstream with the distance away from the shock front . however , there is no support from theory and observations for the magnetic field spatial variation by a large contrast of tens of times in the supernova remnants .",
    "the other possible contribution comes from synchrotron radiation of the secondary relativistic electrons which originate in hadronic process , but this component is about one order of magnitude lower than the observed hard x - ray flux in cas a. finally we discuss the radiation from the asymmetrical supernova explosion which is also supported by the @xmath0ti observations in cas a. if the fastest ejecta have a velocity of @xmath7 and contain an angle of @xmath142 , their synchrotron radiation can produce the non - thermal emission around 100 kev and explains the observed spectral index .",
    "this is consistent with the other observation that shows a  jet \" in cas a.    we are grateful to the referee for the suggestions .",
