    "one of the main purposes of this combined test - beam was to test the atlas strategy to use a calibration based on simulation to reconstruct the correct energy of pions .",
    "the general long - term atlas strategy to use simulation to calibrate the detector response to hadrons is shown in  @xcite , while the quality of the simulation for the combined test beam data is discussed in  @xcite .",

    "the atlas central sampling calorimeters followed : one barrel module of the liquid argon - lead electromagnetic calorimeter ( lar ) with accordion shape was housed in its cryostat and put in front of three hadronic iron - scintillator modules ( tile ) stacked in the azimuthal direction , orthogonally to the incoming test beam axis .     the experimental layout for the 2004 atlas combined test beam .",

    "the 4 million events simulated were split in two statistically independent sets of samples , the first one used for deriving simulation corrections and the second for testing the expected performance .",
    "an incoming pion in the atlas detector causes a shower that is sampled by the seven calorimeter layers of the combined electromagnetic and hadronic sections .",
    "any hadronic calibration scheme has to recover the intrinsic losses due to the invisible energy lost in nuclear interactions .",
    "additional imperfections in the reconstruction also need to be accounted for : corrections are required for the imperfect energy collection of the clustering algorithm ( out - of cluster ) and incomplete shower containment ( leakage of neutrons , muons and neutrinos ) .",
    "finally corrections for energy deposits in non - instrumented material have an important role .",
    "in particular , in the atlas central region ( barrel ) a non - negligible amount of dead material is present between the electromagnetic and hadronic compartments i.e. in the midst of the longitudinal development of most hadronic showers .",
    "two calibration techniques are considered .",
    "the default atlas local hadronic calibration ( lh in the following ) is described in detail in  @xcite . a novel technique ( described in section  [ sec : calibtech ] ) is also considered : it is based on the use of correlations between the signals at the layer level , summing the clustered energy in each calorimeter longitudinal segment .",
    "it is called layer correlation calibration ( lc in the following ) .",
    "the ansatz is that hadronic and electromagnetic energy deposits have different fluctuations properties and , consequently , variables that are sensitive to fluctuations in the total energy can be used both to derive all the corrections and improve the resolution of the total energy measurement .",
    "the two techniques result in different outputs : lh produces calibrated clusters that will be used to form calibrated jets . on the other hand lc",
    "provides calibrated layer energies : such scheme is technically extendible to jets , but it will be aimed at calibrating the given jet energy depositions in a layer .",
    "performance is assessed in terms of linearity and relative resolution .",
    "the total energy is fitted with a gaussian in the [ @xmath4- 2@xmath5 , @xmath4 + 2@xmath5 ] interval where @xmath4 is the mean of the initial energy distribution and @xmath5 is its standard deviation .",
    "linearity is defined as the ratio of the expected fitted average to the beam energy as a function of the beam energy .",
    "relative resolution is defined as the ratio of the fitted standard deviation to the fitted average as a function of the beam energy .",
    "linearity obtained with lh from simulated positive pion events is shown in the upper plot of figure  [ fig : linhadcal ] . at the electromagnetic scale the typical linearity shape for non - compensating calorimeters is observed : about 75% of the beam energy is measured and the linearity ratio increases with beam energy due to the increasing electromagnetic fraction of the shower .",
    "the compensation weights recover about 10% of the total beam energy . the small out - of - cluster corrections account for about 1% of the beam energy .",
    "the remaining 10% is recovered by adding the dead material corrections .",
    "linearity is finally recovered within 2% for beam energy larger than 20 gev .",
    "lh scheme : linearity ( upper plot ) and relative resolution ( lower plot ) for simulated positive pion events impinging on the test - beam setup at @xmath0 = 0.45 .",

    "dead material effects are expected to play a dominant role .",
    "the improvement in relative resolution deriving from suppressing the various fluctuations is expected to reach 11% to 40% .",
    "the lc technique defines the total pion energy as the sum of clustered energy for each calorimeter layer .",
    "the event - by - event layer energy corrections are defined as a function of a specific pair of linear combinations of layer energies .",
    "such combinations are the components of the seven - dimensional vector of layer energies along the vector space basis derived by a principal component analysis ( pca )  @xcite : the two components are used along the basis vectors whose associated pca variance gives the largest contributions to the fluctuations of the total energy .",
    "intuitively , the corrections depend on the `` directions of largest independent fluctuations '' , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an integer from one to seven .",
    "both the weights aimed at compensating the invisible energy and the corrections aimed at recovering dead material losses are derived as two dimensional look - up tables ( seven for the layer energies , one for the dead material correction ) . for both types of tables , @xmath9 ,",
    "the linear combination of layer energies with the largest contributions to the total energy fluctuation is one of the two dimension .",
    "@xmath10 , the linear combination with the second largest contributions to the total energy fluctuation , is the second variable for the calculation of the compensation weights .",

    "the look - up table is shown in figure  [ fig : dmtot ] where the high dead material correction region is well separated form the rest . the correction is derived as a function of the normalized linear combinations mentioned above ( each combination is divided by the best estimate of the total energy ) and it is expressed as a fraction of the total energy itself .",

    "a small correction for the leakage , dead material energy losses upstream of the calorimeters and in between the first ( presampler ) and second ( `` strips '' ) lar layers is calculated by a parametrization obtained from simulation as a function of the total energy estimate @xmath13  ] .",
    "an iterative procedure is then applied : a given total energy estimate provides a new dead material correction which can in turn be used to determine the total energy .",
    "a few iterations are required to obtain a stable result .",
    "all look - up tables are filled by the full set of simulated samples from 15 to 230 gev so as to reduce the beam energy dependence of the correction as much as possible .      in the case of the lc scheme a mix of pions and protons",
    "was used to derive the corrections and to simulate the data .",
    "the contamination values are those from table  [ table : data ] .",
    "the upper plot of figure  [ fig : lclinres ] shows the linearity obtained for both data and simulation : the agreement is within 2% at all stages of calibration .",
    "the resulting picture is similar to that outlined in section  [ sec : hcalexpperf ] for the lh scheme .",
