    "topological insulators have attracted significant attention in recent years,@xcite especially since their experimental realization.@xcite whereas the existence of the topological state and many of its consequences can be understood in terms of exactly solvable , noninteracting models , the interplay of a topological band structure and electronic correlations has become a very active field of research .",
    "the corresponding interacting models do not have general exact solutions , which has made computational methods one of the most important tools .",
    "a possible experimental route to the strongly correlated regime is based on optical lattices.@xcite    the @xmath1 topological band insulator ( tbi ) , or quantum spin - hall insulator , closely related to the integer quantum hall effect,@xcite can be realized in the kane - mele ( km ) model.@xcite the latter describes electrons ( or dirac fermions ) on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice , with nearest - neighbor hopping and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "originally motivated by graphene,@xcite the spin - orbit coupling turned out to be much too small in this material for topological effects to be observable .",
    "however , the km model and its extension , the kane - mele - hubbard ( kmh ) model turn out to be a very useful theoretical framework . in particular",
    ", the honeycomb lattice geometry provides a direct connection to the recently discovered quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) phase of the hubbard model on the same lattice.@xcite for the latter , the dirac spectrum with vanishing density of states at the fermi level leads to a mott transition at a finite critical hubbard @xmath0 , and the qsl phase lies between a semimetal and a magnetic insulator.@xcite finally , the symmetries of the kmh model permit the application of powerful quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods without a sign problem,@xcite so that exact results can be obtained .",
    "the phase diagram of the kmh model has been derived from qmc simulations , @xcite and numerical results for the extent of the qsl were presented in ref .  . at any nonzero spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the semimetal is replaced by the @xmath1 tbi .",
    "in contrast , the gapped qsl is found to be stable up to a finite critical value of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "finally , the magnetic transition of the hubbard model , between the qsl and an antiferromagnetic mott insulator ( afmi ) , is supplemented with a similar transition between the tbi and the afmi in a potentially different universality class . on a qualitative level ,",
    "certain aspects of the phase diagram were obtained for example in mean - field theory,@xcite as well as with cluster methods@xcite and variational qmc.@xcite    the understanding of the kmh model is not complete .",
    "many of the open questions are related to the perhaps most intriguing aspect of the model , namely the qsl phase .",
    "the recent results from approximate cluster methods for parameters in the qsl region of the exact phase diagram inaccurately suggest a rather complete understanding of this exotic phase .",
    "however , strictly speaking , any cluster method breaks translational symmetry , so that a true qsl phase is excluded from the outset . in this light ,",
    "conclusions such as the absence of edge states , or the closing of the single - particle gap across the transition to the tbi are not surprising , as the qsl phase is replaced in these studies by a simple band insulator ( a valence bond crystal ) .",
    "the large correlation lengths ( small gaps ) observed in the qsl phase in the hubbard model@xcite highlight the necessity of careful interpretation of the results obtained by cluster approximations in the context of the qsl .",
    "interesting connections between tbis and qsls are discussed in ref .  .",

    "second , we extend the number of points in parameter space and the observables calculated , in order to provide additional insight",
    ". we also present a refined phase boundary for the qsl phase .",
    "third , we use the qmc method to investigate the quantum phase transitions , especially in the light of recent theoretical predictions.@xcite we show that the tbi  afmi transition is in the expected 3d xy universality class , and provide evidence for the continuous nature of the qsl  tbi and the qsl ",

    "it is beyond the scope of this article to describe the details of the algorithm , and the interested reader is referred to ref .  .",
    "instead , we concentrate on aspects specific to the calculations presented here , namely the choice of the trial wave function , the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation , and the absence of the minus - sign problem for a half - filled band .      in order to simplify the implementation ,",

    "the twist preserves translation symmetry , so that the total momentum remains a good quantum number .",
    "in particular , for an infinitesimal twist , the groundstate has vanishing total momentum .",

    "[ fig : qsl - tbi - sp](b ) ] , the dependence of @xmath160 on @xmath23 is in good agreement with @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "we only show the values @xmath180 .    for a noninteracting @xmath1 tbi , there is a simple relation between the excitation gaps in the single - particle sector and , e.g. , in the spin and particle - hole channels . in the presence of ( strong ) interactions",
    ", these relations may be modified , and we indeed find @xmath176 in the tbi phase above the qsl  tbi transition , as well as in the qsl phase at @xmath38.@xcite the argument that @xmath73 has to close across a transition that involves a change of the topological index@xcite holds only for the noninteracting case . in general , it is not clear which excitation gaps ( one or more ) close if the states on either side of the transition are not adiabatically connected .",
    "for example , in the interacting haldane model,@xcite there is an exact degeneracy of the three lowest states at the tbi to charge density wave transition . as a result , the first and second excitation gaps ( @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) close , but the single - particle gap @xmath73 shows only a cusp at the critical point .    as argued in previous work,@xcite",
    "the results for @xmath73 are consistent with a vanishing of the single - particle gap at @xmath166 .",
    "furthermore , the results in fig .  [ fig : qsl - tbi - sp ] reveal that @xmath73 and @xmath74 behave very similar on approaching @xmath166 from above , and we may therefore expect to see a simultaneous closing of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "such a gap closing suggests different chern numbers for the tbi and qsl phases . additionally , the quick , almost linear opening of the gaps for @xmath167 is reminiscent of fig .",
    "[ fig : sm - tbi](a ) for the sm  tbi transition , suggesting that a non - tbi phase ( the qsl ) exists at small values of @xmath23 , and that a transition to the tbi phase takes place at @xmath183 .",
    "this picture confirms the expectation that the fully gapped qsl phase should be stable under a small perturbation in the form of the spin - orbit term .",
    "we attribute the small but nonzero values of the gaps at @xmath166 to finite - size effects .",
    "although we used the same range of system sizes ( up to @xmath21 ) as for @xmath38,@xcite the larger correlation lengths in the present case , especially in the spin channel , make the analysis significantly harder . on approaching @xmath166 from above ,",
    "the correlation lengths exceed the largest distance available on the clusters used . if we consider only the data points for which the correlation lengths fit on the largest system , i.e.the range @xmath161 in figs .",
    "[ fig : qsl - tbi - sp](a ) and [ fig : qsl - tbi - sp](b ) , the functional form of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath160 strongly suggests a closing of the gaps very close to @xmath163 . the fact that the finite - size scaled gaps in figs .",
    "[ fig : qsl - tbi - sp](a ) and [ fig : qsl - tbi - sp](b ) saturate at a finite value close to @xmath166 is therefore likely to be a result of insufficiently large system sizes .",
    "the latter require that we switch to the polynomial fitting function  ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) close to @xmath166 for @xmath73 , and do not permit a reliable calculation of @xmath74 or @xmath164 close to @xmath166 .",
    "the question if the gaps close or not can not be answered using approximate cluster calculations,@xcite because such methods are not capable of describing a true qsl phase .    to determine the shape of the qsl phase boundary , we have calculated the single - particle gap for two other values of @xmath86 . the critical values @xmath166 are again defined by the location of the cusp in @xmath73 .",

    "the system is either a semimetal ( sm ) ( at zero spin - orbit coupling , @xmath38 ) or a topological band insulator ( tbi ) .",

    "afmi transition can be understood as a condensation of magnetic excitons . a scaling analysis of the magnetization and the spin gap provides clear evidence for the 3d xy nature of the transition .",
    "the onset of long - range order coincides with the closing of the spin gap , whereas the single - particle gap stays finite but shows a cusp at the critical point .",
