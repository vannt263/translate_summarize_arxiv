    "we are thus led to regard @xmath136 as a separate parameter , independent of @xmath94 , that may provide an alternative , albeit qualitative , measure of band warping .",
    "so , we associate with @xmath136 a name and a notion of band  corrugation , \" although that can hardly provide or lead to any more rigorous or general definition . in any case , the basic idea of  corrugation \" is that it increases with increasing number of radial  valleys . \"",
    "one may thus expect that the dos effective mass also increases correspondingly .",
    "although that is often the case , it may not always be so , as we demonstrate with this example .",

    "while @xmath94 increases monotonically with @xmath136 , @xmath129 decreases at first , but subsequently increases with @xmath136.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      we have already demonstrated that the warping parameter @xmath94 may not necessarily increase or correlate with an increasing dos effective mass @xmath129 .",

    "let us then provide a conclusive two - dimensional example that has @xmath96 , although the energy dispersion is _ not _ twice - differentiable , and @xmath129 still decreases at first , and then increases with increasing corrugation or @xmath136 .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] for @xmath153 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "we can prove that the band warping parameter is @xmath96 , independently of corrugation or @xmath136 , but the dos effective mass @xmath129 at first increases with corrugation , then it reaches a maximum at @xmath158 , and subsequently decreases monotonically for all @xmath159 .",

    "this prompts us to introduce in an appendix a more refined definition of a band warping parameter @xmath160 that captures at least that type of non - differentiability .",
    "the @xmath160 alternative to @xmath94 is more elaborate but possibly more helpful in identifying energy dispersions that are not twice - differentiable .",
    "however , since second - order differentiability is inherently based on multi - dimensional limits , there can be no single parameter whose vanishing is sufficient to guarantee that any particular energy dispersion is certainly twice - differentiable at a point .",
    "we have applied the angular effective mass formalism introduced in ref .   to study the density of states in warped and non - warped energy bands at critical points in the brillouin zone .",
    "first we have verified ordinary results for ellipsoidal and hyperbolic energy dispersions .",
    "then we have generalized the expression of the dos to account for general band warping and monotonically increasing non - parabolic energy dispersions .",
    "band warping may or may not increase the dos effective mass .",
    "an intuitive notion of greater band  corrugation , \" referring to energy dispersions that deviate  more severely \" from being twice - differentiable at an isolated critical point , may also vary independently of the corresponding dos effective mass and band warping parameter .",
