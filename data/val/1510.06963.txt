    "the theory of extreme values is a well - developed area of statistics and probability theory @xcite .",
    "extreme values such as the maximal and the minimal data points are important features of a dataset . statistics of extreme events play a key role in a host of data rich subjects including climate science @xcite , geophysics @xcite , and economics @xcite .",
    "the running maximum , defined as the largest variable to date in a sequence of variables , is a central quantity in extreme - value statistics .",
    "this quantity evolves rather slowly : the number of times it changes typically grows logarithmically with the number of random variables @xcite .",
    "consequently , persistence @xcite or first - passage properties @xcite involving the running maxima often exhibit power - law dependence on the number of variables @xcite .",
    "methods and concepts from statistical physics provide a powerful tool for obtaining the nontrivial scaling exponents that characterize such power - law behaviors @xcite .",
    "this investigation is motivated by a recent letter @xcite concerning maximal positions of random walks .",
    "it was reported that the probability that the maxima of multiple random walks remain perfectly ordered decays as a power law with the number of steps @xcite , and that the corresponding decay exponents are generally nontrivial .        here",
    "we study the same probability for _ uncorrelated _ random variables .",
    "figure [ fig - order ] shows three sequences of random variables ( bottom panel ) and the corresponding running maxima ( top panel ) .",
    "the running maxima form three staircases .",
    "we are interested in the probability that these running maxima remain perfectly ordered , or equivalently , that the staircases do not intersect even once .",
    "when the random variables are uncorrelated , this probability is universal : it is completely independent of the distribution from which the variables are drawn .    the probability @xmath2 that the three staircases are ordered decays algebraically with the number of random variables .",
    "interestingly , the decay exponent is nontrivial : @xmath8 we obtain this exponent analytically . in the general case",
    ", we obtain upper and lower bounds implying that the exponent grows linearly with the number of independent sequences .",
    "interestingly , this family of exponents gives a good approximation for the first - passage exponents found for maxima of random walks .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we investigate statistics of perfectly ordered maxima .",
    "we start with two sequences for which the analysis is straightforward . we then present theoretical results for the nontrivial case of three sequences . for the general case ,",
    "we obtain the leading asymptotic behavior of the scaling exponents . in section iii , we treat a related question concerning partially ordered maxima , and show that the exponents obtained in section ii are part of an infinite set of families of scaling exponents .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion of related open problems ( section iv ) .",
    "the appendix details technical derivations used in the three - sequence case .",
    "we study extreme values of multiple sequences of @xmath0 uncorrelated random variables .",
    "let us first consider one sequence of random variables @xmath9 where each of the variables @xmath10 is drawn from the same distribution .",
    "we restrict our attention to continuous distributions for which there are no ties : @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the running maximum @xmath13 is defined as the largest variable to date @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "overall there are @xmath0 maxima .",
    "these maxima are monotonically increasing @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , and form the sequence @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ fig - order ] illustrates that maxima are _ correlated _ stochastic variables : by the definition , a running maxima involves memory of all preceding random variables .    in this study",
    ", we consider @xmath1 independent sequences of random variables such as and their corresponding maxima defined by and ask : what is the probability that the maxima remain perfectly ordered ?",
    "we start with two sequences .",
    "the second sequence of random variables , @xmath19 , is drawn from the same distribution as the first sequence .",
    "the running maxima for the second sequence are again defined by @xmath20 for @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in the probability @xmath2 that the first set of maxima is always larger then the second set : @xmath21 we term @xmath2 the `` survival '' probability since the condition defines a first - passage process @xcite .",
    "the survival probability @xmath2 obeys the _ closed _ recursion relation @xmath22 subject to the `` initial '' condition @xmath23 . to appreciate",
    "let us combine the two sets of @xmath0 random variables into a larger set of @xmath24 variables . since all of these random variables are drawn from the same distribution , each variable is equally likely to be the largest .",
    "in particular , the variable @xmath25 is the largest with probability @xmath26 .",
    "the probability that the leading sequence remains in the lead at the @xmath0th step is therefore @xmath27 .    using eq .",
    "one gets @xmath28 , , @xmath29 , and generally @xmath30 importantly , this probability is _ universal _ as it holds regardless of the distribution from which the random variables are drawn .",
    "there are two requirements for equation to hold : ( i ) all @xmath24 variables must be independent and identically distributed , and ( ii ) the probability distribution that governs these random variables is continuous so that there are no ties .    to obtain the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath0 , we use the stirling formula and equation . we thus find that the survival probability decays algebraically , @xmath31 for large @xmath0 .",
    "as shown below , the survival probability has a similar algebraic decay in the general case , except that the decay exponent depends on the number of sequences .",
    "the same probability distribution arises in the context of discrete time random walks .",
    "consider two walks that start at the origin .",
    "the probability @xmath2 that the positions remain ordered , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , is given by eq .  .",
    "this result , known as the sparre andersen theorem @xcite , remains valid _",
    "regardless _ of the step distribution , e.g. , it holds for levy walks with diverging average step length @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the random variables @xmath34 are uncorrelated , e.g. @xmath35 for all @xmath12 ; further , there are no correlations between the sequences @xmath34 and @xmath36 . as a result ,",
    "the probability @xmath37 that the actual random variables are always ordered , @xmath38 for all @xmath17 , is purely exponential @xmath39 . in view of the much slower algebraic decay ,",
    "we conclude that ordered sequences of random variables are much less likely than ordered sequences of maxima .",
    "we now consider three sequences . we denote the third sequence of random variables as @xmath40 and the corresponding sequence of maxima as @xmath41 .",
    "we are interested in the probability @xmath2 that the three sequences remain perfectly ordered as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - order ] : @xmath42 one immediately finds @xmath43 , but it is challenging to derive @xmath2 for @xmath44 ( see table i ) . our numerical simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - sn3 ] ) show that @xmath2 decays algebraically , @xmath45 for @xmath46 with @xmath47 .     versus @xmath0 for three sequences .",
    "shown are results of monte carlo simulation and the theoretical prediction .",
    "the numerical simulation results were obtained from roughly @xmath48 independent runs .",
    "the inset shows the local slope @xmath49.,scaledwidth=42.5% ]    when there are three sequences , the survival probability @xmath2 no longer obeys a closed recursion equation such as .",
    "there are , however , closed recursion equations for the probability @xmath50 that : ( i ) the maxima are ordered , that is , the condition holds , and ( ii ) the number of variables from the first sequence that are larger than the median maxima equals @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 ) as follows @xmath53 in this schematic representation , the @xmath54 variables are ordered from smallest ( on the left ) to largest ( on the right ) , and moreover , the labels are ignored .",
    "further , the symbol @xmath55 stands for a variable from either one of the three sequences .",
    "the number of variables from the first , second , or third sequence are all equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the survival probability is the sum of the probabilities @xmath50 : @xmath56    the probability @xmath50 obeys the recursion equation @xmath57 to derive we consider the variable @xmath58 in the first sequence , the variable @xmath59 in the second sequence , and the variable @xmath60 in the third sequence .",
    "the first line in accounts for the situation where the variable @xmath51 is not affected by the introduction of these three variables .",
    "( this is the most likely scenario when @xmath0 is large . )",
    "the three fractions account for the probabilities of this event : @xmath61 with probability @xmath62 , the probability that @xmath63 is @xmath64 , and the probability that @xmath65 is @xmath66 .",
    "the next three terms correspond to the three complementary scenarios , e.g. , the second line accounts for the situation where @xmath67 but @xmath63 so that the index @xmath51 increases , @xmath68 .",
    "the recursion is subject to the `` initial '' condition .",
    "the first iteration of yields @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and hence , @xmath71 .",
    "table i lists the next few values of the survival probability , obtained from iteration of the recursion equation .",
    ".the survival probability @xmath2 for @xmath72 . also listed are the integers @xmath73 .",
    "these are the number of possible ways to order the @xmath54 random variables @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and @xmath74 such that the condition holds . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have shown that the probability that the running maxima of independent sets of random variables are ordered decays algebraically with the number of variables .",
    "the scaling exponents that characterize this decay are in general nontrivial . when there are three sequences , the scaling exponent is eigenvalue of a recurrence equation , and it is also a root of a transcendental equation .",
    "the scaling exponents grow linearly with the number of independent sequences .",
    "we have also seen that ordering exponents for uncorrelated random variables provide an excellent approximation for the corresponding set of exponents that characterize maximal positions of random walks .",
    "the key observation that allowed us to treat the three - variable case analytically is that the rank of the median maxima decouples from the sequence length in the asymptotic regime .",
    "this observation , combined with the power - law decay of the overall survival probability reduces the complexity of the underlying combinatorial problem : enumerating the number of ways to order the random variables such that the respective maxima remain ordered .",
    "one can study the probability that the running maxima of the first @xmath75 sequences are ordered and exceed the maxima of remaining @xmath76 sequences .",
    "we have examined such probabilities for @xmath77 and derived analytic expressions for the exponents for the case with persistent leader ( @xmath78 ) and the case with persistent leader and persistent second leader .",
    "we have seen that there are families of exponents , in some cases equivalent to eigenvalues , that form an intriguing structure . for uncorrelated random variables ,",
    "the intersection points of these eigenvalue families mark a linear envelope",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to investigate the corresponding exponent families for ordered maxima of brownian trajectories , where that envelope shows quadratic growth @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are many similar survival probabilities , for example , the probability @xmath79 that the running maxima of one sequence are never the smallest .",
    "numerically , we observe the algebraic decay @xmath80 .",
    "the first exponent is obvious , @xmath81 .",
    "our numerical simulations yield a slowly decreasing set of exponents : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we emphasize that the probability that the actual random variables remain perfectly ordered decays exponentially while the probability that the running maxima maintain perfect order decays much more slowly , namely algebraically , with sequence length .",
    "hence , it is far more likely to observe ordered maxima . in several contexts such as temperature records",
    "@xcite or stock market time series @xcite , record highs or record lows are followed very closely to see for example if one year is the hottest or if one stock is consistently outperforming its peers .",
    "hence , we expect that the questions we investigated theoretically in this study may be of practical relevance in analysis of time series .",
    "moreover , consistently ordered extreme values provide a natural way to quantify persistent upward or downward trends in the data .",
    "we anticipate that the actual survival probabilities , particularly the values of the scaling exponents , may be measurable in empirical data , including those with correlated random variables .",
    "one such example is inter - event times for earthquakes where a series of recent studies demonstrate how `` persistence '' properties of maxima of uncorrelated variables provide excellent predictions for empirical observations @xcite .",
