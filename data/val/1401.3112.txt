    ", it provides higher spectrum efficiency with better communication reliability  @xcite . in the last decades",
    ", mimo has been widely employed in the latest wireless communication standards such as ieee 802.11n , 3gpp long term evolution ( lte ) , wimax and digital video broadcasting  next generation handheld ( dvb - ngh ) etc .",
    "it is also seen as the key technology for the future digital tv terrestrial broadcasting standards  @xcite .",
    "a so - called space - time - space ( 3d ) mimo code  @xcite was proposed for the future tv broadcasting systems in which the services are delivered by the mimo transmission in a single frequency network ( sfn ) .",
    "specifically , it is proposed for a distributed mimo broadcasting scenario where tv programs are transmitted by two geographically separated transmission sites , each site equipping two transmit antennas . on the other hand ,",
    "each receiver has two receive antennas , forming a @xmath3 mimo transmission .",
    "the 3d mimo code has been shown to be robust and efficient in the distributed mimo broadcasting scenarios where there exists strong received signal power imbalances  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is a promising candidate for the mimo profile of future broadcasting standards .",
    "however , the 3d mimo code suffers from a high computational complexity when the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding is adopted .",
    "the decoding complexity is as high as @xmath1 when @xmath2-qam constellation is used .",
    "up to now , no study on the decoding complexity reduction for the 3d mimo code has been carried out in the literature .    recently a lot of efforts have been made in the stbc design to obtain both high code rate and low decoding complexity  @xcite .",
    "the decoding complexity reduction is commonly achieved by exploiting the orthogonality embedded in the stbc codeword .",
    "when there exists group - wise orthogonality in the codeword , the joint detection of many information symbols is converted into independent , group - wise detections  @xcite , yielding low decoding complexity .",
    "for other cases such as djabba code  @xcite , biglieri - hong - viterbo ( bhv ) code  @xcite , srinath - rajan code  @xcite and ismail - fiorina - sari ( ifs ) code  @xcite in which the orthogonality only exists in a part of information symbols , some symbols can be detected in a group - wise manner once we condition them with respect to other symbols .",
    "the ml solutions can be obtained with a lower complexity compared with the ml detector . in other words ,",
    "their decoding complexity is less than @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of information symbols in a codeword .",
    "such kind of stbcs are referred to as fast decodable stbcs  @xcite .",
    "however , most of fast - decodable stbcs are not optimized for distributed mimo broadcasting scenarios and they are not robust under the received signal power imbalance conditions  @xcite .    a partial interference cancellation",
    "( pic ) group decoding scheme has been presented aiming at reducing the decoding complexity of the stbcs containing group - wise orthogonalities in the codewords  @xcite .",
    "a number of stbcs that are optimized for this decoding scheme have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this scheme actually uses a linear equalization to convert the joint detection of a large number of symbols to several groups of ml decodings for few symbols .",
    "however , the overall performance of this decoding scheme can not achieve the ml optimality .",
    "some alternatives with reduced decoding complexity have been presented for the distributed mimo broadcasting .",
    "described a stbc with less decoding complexity based on orthogonal basis  @xcite .",
    "however , such a code does not achieve full - diversity or full - rate for @xmath3 mimo transmissions and therefore performs worse than 3d mimo code .",
    "a `` punctured version '' of 3d mimo code that is full - rate for @xmath3 mimo transmissions with low decoding complexity has also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , it does not achieve full - diversity and is hence less robust in harsh channel conditions .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a reduced - complexity ml decoder for the 3d mimo code which exploits the embedded orthogonality in the codeword .",
    "the main contributions are :    * we propose to modify the original 3d mimo codeword through some permutations of information symbols which leads to an ml decoding algorithm with reduced complexity without affecting all desirable properties of the 3d mimo code .",
    "* we prove that the 3d mimo code is fast decodable .",
    "moreover , we show that the worst case decoding complexity is @xmath0 for @xmath2-ary square qam modulations which is the least among all square full - rate stbcs for @xmath3 mimo transmission .",
    "* based on the unique properties of the new form of 3d mimo codeword , we propose a novel implementation of the simplified decoder that achieves a lower average complexity in terms of time latency without losing the ml optimality .",
    "the proposed implementation is also applicable for other fast decodable stbcs .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "some fundamentals of the mimo detection are presented in section  [ sec : sys_mdl ] . in section  [ sec:3dmimo ] ,",
    "the 3d mimo code is first recalled .",

    "the 3d mimo code  @xcite possesses a better robustness against receive signal power imbalances in the distributed mimo broadcasting scenarios but suffers from high decoding complexity  @xcite . in this section , we propose a new 3d mimo codeword that enables low sphere decoding complexity via exchanging the positions of information symbols in the original 3d mimo codeword .",
    "the basic idea behind this modification comes from the facts that the orthogonality embedded in the information symbols essentially enables independent detections and the sphere decoding complexity is mainly determined by the orthogonality among the first several symbols .",
