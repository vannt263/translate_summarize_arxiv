    "transaction costs preclude perfect replication of contingent claims and introduce a tradeoff between the risk and return to hedging . a standard approach to dealing with this tradeoff",
    "is to use utility functions for evaluating hedging errors ( hodges and neuberger 1989 ) and the utility indifference principle for pricing options ( davis et al .",
    "in contrast to the elegance of black - scholes delta hedging , these models typically lack explicit solutions and require powerful numerical methods to obtain case - by - case approximations of optimal hedges .    in some situations the particular structure of the optimal hedging strategy",
    "is known , which facilitates numerical analysis .",
    "one example is the black - scholes model with proportional transaction costs , where the hedging strategy of a trader with cara utility function is defined by a no - trade region ( davis et al .",
    "when the hedger s stock holdings are outside this region , she carries out a trade that brings the stock position onto the nearest boundary point .",
    "numerical methods that approximate value functions have proved successful in this model , see , e.g. , monoyios ( 2004 ) .",
    "a different approach is presented in zakamouline ( 2006 ) who derives analytic approximations of the two boundaries of the no - trade region .",
    "motivated by asymptotic results in whalley and wilmott ( 1997 ) , his approach combines a clever guess of a parametric functional form with the estimation of coefficients as functions of model parameters .",
    "these estimations , however , require a numerical approximation of the optimal hedging strategy .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative approach to derive explicit hedging strategies for general nonlinear transaction costs .",
    "the approach is based on genetic programming which offers several advantages over classical numerical approaches .",
    "first , by construction it is constrained to output closed - form expressions that are functions of the model parameters .",
    "second , it delivers efficient results at low cost by solving the two tasks of finding an optimal hedging strategy and a closed - form representation for it in one integrated process .",
    "third , no assumption is made on the functional form of the approximation .",
    "genetic programming therefore avoids the disadvantage of ex post calibration methods and , at the same time , offers a technique that deals with cases in which there is no a priori information on the structure of the optimal solution .",
    "the closed - form approximations of hedging strategies derived with this heuristic method can be directly tested in different market situations to verify their efficiency before their integration into an automated trading system .",
    "the hard work of obtaining these hedging strategies is left to the computer .",
    "once this is done , hedging is without sweat .    in the example considered in this paper",
    "we determine closed - form expressions for the hedging strategy of an option writer with cara utility function under proportional and quadratic transaction costs .",
    "the price of the underlying follows a geometric brownian motion .",
    "solutions to this problem with a large range of parameter values are derived at various requirements on the simplicity of hedging strategies , ranging from full - fledged computer programs to short analytic functions .",
    "parameters include volatility , interest rate , strike price of the european call , and transaction cost parameters .",
    "information available to the hedger consists of stock price , black - scholes delta and gamma , time to maturity , and current portfolio holdings , in addition to the parameter values which are random but constant until maturity of an option .",
    "our method produces better results than zakamouline ( 2006 ) when transaction costs are proportional . under",
    "quadratic transaction costs we find simple near - optimal linear trading strategies that consist of a trade intensity and a no - trade reference solution .",
    "the no - trade path can be interpreted as a modified black - scholes delta and the trade intensity as a modified gamma . in summary",
    ", the paper demonstrates the practical use of genetic programming in deriving hedges under nonlinear transaction costs .",
    "we consider the hedging problem faced by a risk - averse writer of a european call option .",
    "the option writer can trade in the underlying whose price follows a geometric brownian motion @xmath0 with constant drift @xmath1 and volatility @xmath2 .",
    "she also has access to a money account that pays interest at constant rate @xmath3 .",

    "it is deducted from the trader s money account at the time a transaction takes place .",
    "the transaction cost has two components : ( a ) a proportional cost @xmath13 which arises in markets with a bid - ask spread of size @xmath14 and mid point given by the stock price @xmath9 ; and ( b ) a nonlinear cost which arises in markets when a trade can ` walk up ' an order book , i.e. , obtains worse prices the larger the trade .",

    "it also allows to determine option prices through the indifference principle : the option premium is determined by the amount of money that when paid to the option writer gives the same utility as not writing the option and forgoing the premium . if the initial endowment is @xmath49 ( which gives utility -1 if no option is written ) , then the price is @xmath50 \\right ) = ( 1/\\gamma ) \\exp(- r t ) \\",

    "solving the hedging problem described in section  [ sec : model ] is a straightforward application of genetic programming ( koza 1992 ) .",

    "a byte code program representation is used for genetic recombination ( crossover and mutation ) , and a machine code representation ( nordin 1997 ) is used for fast computation of hedging decisions .",

    "our software also contains a byte code disassembler whose output can be processed by a c compiler , or analyzed with maxima or similar tools for symbolic math manipulation .",
    "we first apply the genetic programming ( gp ) method to the model with proportional transaction costs ( with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "two different treatments will be applied .",
    "trading strategies are first evolved using the gp approach without any information about the structure of the optimal hedge strategies . we choose to ignore the knowledge that under proportional transaction costs the optimal strategy is defined by a no - trade region because under other cost structures such a priori information is typically not available . in a second treatment , we derive a simple analytic closed - form expression to approximate the no - trade region .      the structure of the hedging strategies is given by .",
    "strategies are represented as computer programs whose operators include arithmetic expressions as well as _ min _ , _ max _ , conditional assignments , and forward jumps ( conditional and unconditional ) .",
    "the output from a program is interpreted as a decision of how much stock to buy or sell given the current combination of option parameters and variables .",
    "the programs can be used as is in an automated trading application , although they may be difficult to analyze due to the occurrence of conditional jumps and assignments .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     figure  [ fig : tradingqc ] provides an illustration of our results for an example option and stock price path . as in figure",
    "[ fig : tradingpc ] , the left panel depicts trade volumes for each day and each stock position in @xmath54 $ ] for a typical trading strategy evolved with the gp algorithm , but in the this case with quadratic transaction costs .",
    "the left panel shows that the trade volume is approximately a linear function of the stock position for most stock positions and most periods in time .",
    "intersecting the graph with the horizontal plane at zero on the vertical axis , one obtains a curve through combinations of time and stock positions where there is no trade , and such that for other nearby points on the graph , the trade volume on the corresponding day is a constant fraction of the difference between the corresponding no - trade position and stock position .",
    "these observations suggest that linear trading strategies will provide good performance under quadratic transaction costs .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : tradingqc ] shows the projection of the no - trade curve ( grey ) along with the gp hedge ( bold black ) , and the delta hedge ( dotted ) .",
    "also shown is the trade intensity ( black ) , defined as trade volume divided by the absolute difference between the current stock position and the no - trade stock position .",
    "the latter closely tracks the black - scholes delta .",
    "the hedging strategy adjusts the stock position towards the no - trade stock position , but this adjustment is quite slow , as the trade intensity is typically less than 20% .",
    "we therefore observe large deviations between actual stock holdings and the no - trade curve .",
    "closer to maturity the trade intensity is more volatile but then declines quickly ( resembling the widening of the no - trade region under proportional costs ) .",
    "this general pattern of sluggish adjustment leads to substantial savings in transaction costs compared to the black - scholes delta .      to explore the performance of linear hedging strategies under quadratic costs , we apply the gp algorithm to trading strategies of the form @xmath55\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the no - trade stock position and",
    "@xmath57 is the trading intensity , and both are analytic expressions .",
    "the functions are constrained to be independent of stock holdings but are allowed to depend on time , greeks , and the parameter vector @xmath30 which are suppressed in .    as in the proportional cost case , making use of information about the ( approximate ) structure of the optimal hedge leads to strategies that are slightly better than those obtained without such information . in the current case , the mean improvement in performance amounts to 0.3 cents per option .",
    "this improvement is of the same order of magnitude as in the proportional cost case , where the a priori information was known to be correct .",
    "we therefore conjecture that linear strategies of the form ( [ eq : stratqc ] ) are near - optimal for hedgers with cara utility functions and quadratic transaction costs when the initial stock position is not too far from its desired level .",
    "the following approximation was obtained by means of the same simplification approach as in section  [ sec : prop_notrade ] .",
    "it produces hedging decisions that perform as well as the best strategy in its class . for a given date @xmath58 , the no - trade stock position @xmath59 and the trading intensity @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath62 , as before .",
    "the paper demonstrates the merits of a gp approach to solving optimal hedging problems under transaction costs .",
    "this heuristic method delivers approximations that are analytic functions of various parameters describing the option contract , the dynamic of the underlying , and transaction costs .",
    "these explicit approximations to optimal hedging strategies can easily be tested and integrated into an automated trading system .",
    "other estimation methods , such as zakamouline s ( 2006 ) , derive closed - form approximations using ad hoc specifications of the functional form and an exact ( numerical ) solution for their calibration .",
    "in contrast to such approaches , ours is both simpler and more general , as it requires neither explicit solutions nor assumptions about functional forms .",
    "preliminary results indicate that our gp method also works well for exotic options , other nonlinear transaction costs and stochastic volatility models but that is beyond the scope of this short note .",
