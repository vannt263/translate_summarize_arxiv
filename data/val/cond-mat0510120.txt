    "the physics of strongly interacting quantum systems has been subject of intense investigations since the early days of quantum mechanics . with",
    "the recent developments in the field of ultracold quantum gases , systems of strongly correlated bosonic and fermionic atoms with tunable interactions have become amendable to experimental studies @xcite .",
    "complete theoretical understanding of these coupled many - body systems is difficult , and only rare examples exist , for which analytical solutions for the ground state could be explicitly been given @xcite .",
    "of particular importance in this context is the bose - hubbard model , which can describe bosons or fermions in an optical lattice or in a double well potential .",
    "this model serves as a prototype system exhibiting a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "triggered by the recent observation of this phase transition from a superfluid to a mott - insulating phase with bosonic atoms in one- ( 1d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattices @xcite , the ground state and correlation properties of the bose - hubbard model have been extensively investigated by a large number of groups @xcite .",
    "complete theoretical understanding of these coupled many - body systems is difficult , and only rare examples exist , for which analytical solutions for the ground state could be explicitly been given @xcite .",
    "the description generally has to rely upon approximation of numerical or analytical methods such as the density - group - renormalization @xcite , quantum monte carlo approaches @xcite , perturbative calculations @xcite , and mean - field treatments , e.g. , gutzwiller ansatz @xcite . in this context , it is necessary to introduce different methods which give the energy spectrum of a many - body hamiltonian and its respective eigenstates or at least the ground - state .    in this paper",
    ", we use the concept of doorway states to study bosons in a double well and bosons in an optical lattice .",
    "both systems can be described by the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the method is based on the construction of doorway projectors as initially introduced by feshbach in the context of scattering theory in nuclear physics to explain the appearance of intermediate structures in the cross section @xcite .",
    "the main idea underlying this approach is a dynamically motivated decomposition of the full hilbert space of the hamiltonian into a sequence of mutually orthogonal subspaces .",
    "the first subspace in the hierarchy is chosen on the basis of its particular relevance to the problem at hand and making use of the symmetries of the hamiltonian . in the original context of nuclear reactions",
    "this subspace spans the open channels . in the context of the bose - hubbard model",
    ", it spans the analytical lowest energy solutions of the pure hopping or the pure superfluid limiting cases , when one is interested in approximating the system ground - state .",
    "subsequent subspaces are chosen as spanned by new state vectors generated from the action of the hamiltonian on each partially defined subspace .",
    "formally , this is implemented by establishing a sequence of mutually orthogonal projectors @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is the identity operator and the hamiltonian has non - vanishing matrix elements only between states in consecutive members of the hierarchy .",
    "this hierarchy allows for dynamically controlled truncation schemes which may significantly reduce the computational effort .",
    "the advantage of the doorway approach is that it can be used as a numerical or analytical tool .",
    "the doorway method is also know as projection formalism and continued - fraction representation @xcite .",
    "moreover , this approach can be seen as a generalization of the several other schemes developed in different areas of many - body physics , such as the lanczos method @xcite of solid state physics , the resolvent method @xcite of quantum optics , and the feshbach - fano partitioning method @xcite of quantum chemistry .",
    "note , in particular , that in each of these methods the subspaces are one - dimensional .",
    "usually it is much more difficult to obtain the eigenstates of a given hamiltonian rather than the eigenvalues of the energy . in this context , the way the doorway method is constructed creates a reduced subspace where the bose - hubbard hamiltonian can be projected .",
    "the projection of the hamiltonian in this reduced subspace allows for the knowledge of part of the energy spectrum and its correspondent eigenstates .",
    "we are mainly interested in the ground - state of this system which features both the superfluid and mott - insulator regimes . in this context",
    ", the energy spectrum with the same symmetry of the ground - state and the ground - state wavefunction of the bose - hubbard model are calculated .",
    "furthermore , the correlation properties of a low density bosonic system in an optical lattice are calculated over the full range of coupling parameters and found to qualitatively describe the measurements of @xcite , even though these experiments are inhomogeneous systems due to the presence of an external trap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secum ] a more formal presentation of the doorway approach",
    "is given . in section [ secdois ]",
    "the doorway approach is applied to solve @xmath0 bosons distributed in @xmath3-sites , described by the bose - hubbard model . in subsection [ secdoisa ]",
    "we start with @xmath4 sites and the doorway method is used to obtain the energy spectrum and the ground - state . in subsection [ secdoisb ] the approach is applied to the more general case ( @xmath0-boson distributed among @xmath3-sites ) , where experimental observables such as chemical potential , on - site variance and visibility are calculated .",
    "the doorway method consists in splitting the full hilbert space of the many - body hamiltonian @xmath5 into different subspaces which are accessed by the action of projectors on @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the projector onto the subspace @xmath7 generated by a set of state vectors which are relevant for the lowest order approximation to the system at hand .",
    "specific choices in connection with bose - hubbard systems are discussed in the subsections below .",
    "@xmath7 is in general multi - dimensional , so that @xmath8 in terms of a orthonormal set of state vectors @xmath9 . from @xmath6 ,",
    "it is possible to construct the basis which generates the first doorway subspace by the action of @xmath10 which have to be normalized . the second doorway state is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 as the normalized first doorway state . the second doorway @xmath13 has also to be normalized .",
    "the orthogonalization of the doorway states is done at each step .",
    "the procedure terminates when @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) denoting the projectors onto the doorway spaces .",
    "the space @xmath16 then represents an irreducible subspace for the hamiltonian containing the initial subspace @xmath7 .",
    "the crucial point is the choice of the most adequate starting state @xmath17 to generate the initial subspace to obtain the solution in the most efficient way .",
    "the many - body schrdinger equation is solved in this subspace    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 . using the second equation recursively",
    ", one obtains a nonlinear problem within the @xmath6-subspace which determines the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in the full hilbert space .",
    "all orders of interactions described by the hamiltonian are taken into account inside this subspace .",
    "therefore , the expansion is not perturbative in the couplings , but it represents the full solution in a subspace of lower ( reduced ) dimension .",
    "once the solution is truncated , the diagonalization of the hamiltonian happens within the used subspace ( e.g. @xmath23 ) .",
    "information about the eigenstates of the system can be obtained by projecting the original hamiltonian in the reduced subspace created by the doorway states , which can be either complete or truncated , depending on the physical system . in this case",
    "the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the matrix elements of the reduced hamiltonian . in spite of the original doorway procedure giving no information about the eigenstates of the system , one can use the reduced subspace which is created by the doorway states to project the hamiltonian in this reduced subspace , and then diagonalize it to obtain information about the eigenstates of the system .",
    "we apply the doorway method to a system of @xmath0 bosons in a 1d optical lattice of @xmath3 sites in the homogeneous case .",
    "the system is described by the bose - hubbard model @xmath27    which can be seen as a many - mode approximation for an ultracold gas of bosonic atoms occupying the lowest band in a periodic array of potential wells @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of a boson in the @xmath30-th site , and @xmath31 is the number of atoms at the lattice site @xmath30 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the strength of the on site repulsion of two atoms on the lattice site @xmath33 is characterized by @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is the hopping matrix element between adjacent sites which characterizes the strength the tunneling term .",
    "a periodic boundary condition is included allowing for tunneling between the first and the last site of the lattice ( site @xmath36 site 1 ) . in the case of @xmath4 sites ,",
    "the periodic boundary condition is already intrinsic .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the bose - hubbard hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions conserves two important quantities : the total number of particles and the total quasi - momentum . as a consequence",
    ", its hilbert space can be partitioned into m decoupled subspaces corresponding to the values of quasi - momentum ( q=0, ... ,m-1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the subspace with q=0 and , for even m , also the subspace with quasi - momentum q = m/2 , can be further partitioned into symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces ( `` odd - even '' symmetry ) @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the system lies in the symmetric @xmath37 subspace .",
    "thus , the initial p subspace is chosen within this subspace .",
    "the full set of doorway subspaces constructed from the initial @xmath7 subspace will finally span the symmetric part of the subspace with zero quasi - momentum , providing the full solution for the ground state . in order to define the @xmath7 subspace",
    ", one can use the fact that the ground state of the system has two different limiting cases : the superfluid phase for @xmath38 where the particles are delocalized over the whole lattice , and the mott - insulating phase for @xmath39 where the particles are localized with an equal number of atoms per site @xmath40 .      to illustrate how the method works , we first apply the doorway method to the two - site bose - hubbard model , which corresponds to @xmath0 bosons in a double - well .",
    "first , the doorway method is used to construct the reduced subspace the two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian is projected .",
    "the projected hamiltonian can be diagonalized .",
    "analytical expressions for the matrix elements of the reduced hamiltonian @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are found .",
    "we start the doorway construction for the repulsive case using different @xmath17 states , since there is a crucial difference between the ground state for @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd . for @xmath45 ,",

    "the doorway solution of the energy spectrum of the system is , of course , in perfect agreement with the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the doorway solution of the energy spectrum , which corresponds to the exact one , can be fully generated by considering @xmath62 ( @xmath0 even or odd ) doorways for the symmetric and @xmath63 ( @xmath0 even ) or @xmath62 ( for @xmath0 odd ) doorways for the antisymmetric situation .",
    "it is well - know that the energy spectrum of this system is composed of regions with and without quasi - degenerate doublets @xcite which is confirmed by the doorway solution .",
    "the degeneracy of the doublets is broken as the tunneling parameter increases .",
    "the same analysis can be extended to the case of attractive on - site interaction .    in the case",
    "considered here , the doorway method is optimized to give information about the eigenstates of the system , but the attention will be focus on the ground - state / first excited state and the last two excited states of the system .",
    "the general form of the ground state of this system with @xmath0-even particles as a function of the tunneling parameter is @xmath64 . for this particular case ,",
    "the ground - state is the analogous to the mott state for the two - site bose - hubbard model .",
    "this ground - state is an unique state .",
    "however , the ground state of the system with @xmath0 odd is a degenerate doublet for @xmath65 .",
    "this degeneracy of the ground state is lifted as the tunneling parameter increases .",
    "thus , one of the states of the quasi - degenerate doublet becomes the ground - state while the other state becomes the first excited state .",
    "the ground - state and the first excited state are given respectively by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as a function of the tunneling parameter .",

    "the semi - classical solution is always localized ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it also does not make any difference if the on - site interaction is repulsive or attractive .",
    "the last two excited states are a quasi - degenerate doublet , where one of the states of the doublet . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the last two excited states are given by @xmath68\\equiv|d_{last}\\rangle$ ] and for @xmath69 new components are created in the states @xmath70 .",
    "these excited states represent even - odd macroscopic superpositions ( even and odd schrdinger cat states ) . nowadays",
    ", enormous effort has been put to create such states , since they are important to quantum information , spectroscopy and so on .",
    "those states have been theoretically found before as the symmetry - preserving - class of solutions of the gp equation which preserves the symmetry @xcite .",
    "it has been observed these even - odd macroscopic superpositions do not lose their strength until @xmath71 , and after that point , they start to disappear very quickly . to understand why they are more robust than any other states of spectrum",
    ", one has to look how the energy spectrum changes as a function of the tunneling parameter .",
    "these states are the last to be affected by the increase of tunneling parameter .",
    "it is the last degeneracy to be broken .",
    "even with a considerable vale of the tunneling parameter @xmath72 .",
    "we extend the previous analysis to a more general case , the bose - hubbard model for a lattice ( @xmath3-sites ) .",
    "moreover , observables of one - body and two - body , such as chemical potential , variance and visibility are calculated with the help of the doorway method . for the commensurable situation ( @xmath73 ) we choose @xmath74 corresponding to the ground state of the system in the pure mott case ( @xmath75 ) , which generates a one - dimensional subspace @xmath7 . if an extra particle is added to or removed from the system ( @xmath76 ) ( non - commensurate situation ) , the initial multi - dimensional subspace @xmath7 is generated and has the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "starting from these initial subspaces the correspondent doorway subspaces are constructed . for non - commensurate situation , however there is a simpler way to obtain only the ground - state , which is to start instead with the symmetric superposition @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , the doorway method gives the flexibility to choose another states as the starting point @xmath80 .",
    "depending on the parameters of interest , one may also start from the pure superfluid state ( @xmath38 ) as the initial state @xmath80 in the construction of the doorways , following the same procedure discussed in the section before .",
    "we will use this flexibility to study the on - site variance later . after finishing to generate the doorway subspaces ,",
    "the part of the energy spectrum and the ground - state are obtained by solved by projecting the @xmath3-site bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the reduced subspace created by @xmath6 and doorway projectors .",
    "unfortunately for this general case , it is not easy to obtain analytical expressions for the matrix elements of the reduced hamiltonian as in the previous case ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "one can check that the superfluid ground state @xmath84 is asymptotically reached for @xmath85 .",
    "the doorway method genuinely reduces the numerical effort to the diagonalization of the very small , but relevant part of the total hilbert space . for small number of sites ,",
    "it is possible to obtain numerically the full solution of the energy spectrum and ground state .",
    "however , for larger number of sites , it is not so easy to generate all doorways one needs to obtain the full solution because of numerical reasons , such as lack of available memory . in this context",
    "it is important to discuss the convergency of the method . a good measure for the convergence of the method is given by the `` reliability '' defined as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 being the exact ground state of the system obtained from the exact numerical diagonalization of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian and @xmath88 being the maximum number of doorways to generate the truncated solution .",
    "the meaning of the reliability can be understood in terms of the portion of the full symmetric subspace which has been covered by the truncated solution .",
    "the convergency of the method scales linearly with the number of particles for the commensurate and incommensurate cases .",
    "we have tested this convergency for cases we are able to obtain the exact solution .",
    "fig.[one](a ) illustrates this convergency for @xmath89 , considering the truncated solution for @xmath90 doorways .",
    "the convergency is then achieved after the fifth doorway @xmath91 is created , showing the subspace spanned by the doorways already include the most relevant portion of the full symmetric subspace . for this particular case ,",
    "the hilbert space is of dimension @xmath92 whereas the symmetric zero quasi - momentum subspace has only dimension @xmath93 .",
    "the convergency of the method is surprisingly fast , since the recursive construction of the doorway states `` automatically '' creates the most efficient path into the irreducible subspace depending on the specific values of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
