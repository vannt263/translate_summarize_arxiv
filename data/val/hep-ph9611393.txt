    "the flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are the most promising field for testing the standard model ( sm ) predictions at loop level and for establishing new physics beyond that ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . at the same time the rare decays",
    "provide a direct and reliable tool for extracting information about the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , such as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "after the experimental observation of the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite processes , the interest is focused on the other possible rare @xmath9-meson decays , which are expected to be observed at future @xmath9-meson factories and fixed target machines .",
    "in addition to being used in the determination of the ckm matrix elements , the rare @xmath9-meson decays could play an important role in extracting information about some hadronic parameters , such as the leptonic decay constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "pure leptonic decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not useful for this purpose , since these decays are helicity suppressed and as a result they have branching ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . for @xmath16 meson case",
    "the situation becomes worse due to the smaller ckm angle .",
    "although the process @xmath17 , whose branching ratio in the sm is @xmath18 @xcite , is free of helicity suppression , its observability is expected to be compatible with the observability of the @xmath12 decay only when its efficiency is better than @xmath19 .",
    "when a photon is emitted in addition to the lepton pair , no helicity suppression exists anymore and larger branching ratios are expected . for that reason ,",
    "the investigation of the @xmath20 decay becomes interesting .",
    "the branching ratios of these processes depend quadratically on the leptonic decay constants of b mesons and hence it could be a possible alternate in determining @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in @xcite ,",
    "these decays are investigated in the sm using the constituent quark approach and it is shown that the diagrams with a photon radiation from the light quark give the dominant contribution to the decay amplitude which is inversely proportional to the constituent light quark mass . however the concept of the `` constituent quark mass '' is itself poorly understood .",
    "therefore , any prediction on the branching ratios , in the framework of the above mentioned approach , is strongly model dependent .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the @xmath20 processes practically in a model independent way , namely , within the framework of the light cone qcd sum rules method ( more about the method and its applications can be found in a recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect.2 we give the relevant effective hamiltonian for the @xmath21 decay . in sect.3 we derive the sum rules for the transition formfactors .",
    "sect.4 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the formfactors , and the calculation of the differential and total widths for the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) decays . in this section",
    "we also present a comparison of our results with those of @xcite .",
    "the most important contribution to @xmath22 @xmath24 stems from the effective hamiltonian which induces the pure leptonic process @xmath25 .",
    "the short distance contributions to @xmath26 decay , comes from the box , z - boson and photon mediated diagrams ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the qcd corrected quark level amplitude in the sm can be written as @xcite :    & = & v_tb v_tq^ * c_9^eff ( |q _ p_l b ) |l _ l + c_10|q _ p_l b |l _ _ 5 l - + & & - 2 |q i _ p _",
    "( m_b p_r + m_q p_l ) b |l _",
    "here @xmath27 /2 $ ] , and p is the momentum of the lepton pair .",
    "the analytic expressions for all wilson coefficients can be found in @xcite . in further considerations",
    "we shall neglect the mass of the light quarks .",
    "as we have already noted , the pure leptonic processes @xmath28 @xmath29 are helicity suppressed . if a photon is attached to any of the charged lines in fig.1 , the situation becomes different ; helicity suppression is overcome .",
    "if a photon is emitted from the final charged lepton lines , it follows from the helicity arguments that the amplitude of such diagrams must be proportional to the lepton mass @xmath30",
    ". therefore the contribution of such diagrams are negligible .",
    "when a photon is attached to any charged internal line , the contributions of these diagrams will be strongly suppressed by a factor of @xmath31 in the wilson coefficients , since the resulting operators have dimension 8 , which are two orders higher than usual operators in ( 1 ) .",
    "so , we conclude that the main contribution comes from the diagrams in fig.1 with a photon radiation from the initial quark lines .",
    "thus the corresponding matrix element for the process @xmath32 can be written as    b & = & v_tb v_tq^ * c_9^eff |l _ l ( q ) |q _ ( 1-_5 ) b b(p+q ) + + & & + c_10^eff |l _ _ 5 l ( q ) |q _ ( 1-_5 ) b b(p+q)- + & & - 2 c_7 |l _ l ( q ) |q i _ p _ ( 1 + _ 5 ) b b(p+q )    these transition amplitudes can be written in terms of two independent , gauge invariant ( with respect to the electromagnetic field ) structures :    \\(q ) |q _ ( 1- _ 5 ) b b(p+q ) & = & e _",
    "e_^ * p_q _ + + & & + i  , + ( q ) |q i _",
    "p_(1 + _ 5 ) b b(p+q ) & = & e _",
    "e_^ * p_q _ + + & & + i  . here",
    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for the polarization vector and the momentum of the photon , @xmath35 is the momentum of the lepton pair , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 describe the parity conserving and parity violating formfactors .",
    "thus , the main problem is to calculate the formfactors @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 including their momentum dependence . for this aim",
    "we will employ the light cone qcd sum rules method .",
    "note that the formfactors @xmath40 and @xmath42 are calculated in the light cone qcd sum rules in @xcite .",
    "therefore we concentrate ourselves to the calculation of formfactors @xmath41 and @xmath43 induced by the magneto - dipole interaction .",
    "according to the qcd sum rules ideology , in order to calculate the transition formfactors @xmath39 and @xmath37 , it is necessary to write the representation of a suitable correlator function in the hadronic and quark - gluon languages .",
    "we start by considering the following correlator function _ ( p , q ) & = & i    this correlator can be calculated in two different ways .",
    "on one side we insert to @xmath44 the hadronic states with @xmath9 meson quantum numbers",
    ". then we have _",
    "( p , q)&= & ( q ) |q i _",
    "p_(1+_5 ) b b(p+q ) + & = & e + & & _ e_^ * p_q_+ + i  .",
    "in deriving eq(5 ) we used b |b i _ 5 q 0 = on the other hand , the correlation function ( 4 ) , can be calculated in qcd at large euclidean momenta @xmath45 . in general , the correlator ( 4 ) can be decomposed into the parity conserving and parity violating parts _ ( p , q ) = _ e_^ * p_q__1 + i _ 2 equating eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) we get sum rules for the formfactors @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "let us start calculating @xmath44 from qcd side .",
    "the virtuality of the heavy quark in the correlator function under consideration , is large and of order @xmath46 .",
    "thus , one can use the perturbative expansion of the heavy quark propagator in the external field of slowly varying fluctuations inside the photon .",
    "the leading contribution is obtained by using the free heavy quark propagator in eq.(4 ) .",
    "then we have _ ( p , q)&= & |q(x ) i _ p_(1+_5)(k+m_b)i _ 5 q(0 ) 0 +   + & = & - p _",
    "m_b |q(x ) _ ( 1+_5 ) q(0)0 - + & & -k_|q(x ) _ _ ( 1-_5 ) q(0 ) 0 in this equation a path ordered gauge factor between the quark fields is omitted , since in the fock - schwinger gauge @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the external electromagnetic field , it is irrelevant .    the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in fig.2 describe only the short distance ( perturbative ) part of these matrix elements corresponding to the photon emission from the freely propagating heavy and light quarks .",
    "the non - perturbative contributions correspond to the propagation of the light quark in the presence of external electromagnetic field ( fig.2c and 2d ) .",
    "we consider now the perturbative contributions .",
    "for the diagrams ( 2-a and 2-b ) we can write down the double dispersion representation ^(1,2 ) =   +   here , superscripts @xmath49 , and @xmath50 correspond to the contributions of the spectral densities to the structures @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .    for calculating the spectral densities @xmath53 and @xmath54 we use the method given in @xcite .",

    "next consider the non - perturbative contributions . from eq.(7 ) it follows that the non - perturbative contributions are expressed via the matrix elements of the gauge invariant nonlocal operators , sandwiched in between the vacuum and the photon state .",
    "these matrix elements define the following light cone photon wave functions ( @xcite , see also the first reference in @xcite ) :     & & ( e_q_- e_q _ ) + + & & + g_2(u )   +    @xmath61 is magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the leading twist @xmath64 photon wave functions , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the two particle @xmath67 wave functions .",
    "note that for calculating the matrix elements & & ( q ) |q(x ) _ _ ( 1-_5 ) q(0 ) 0   + & & ( q ) |q(x ) _ _ 5 q(0 ) 0 we use the following identities : & & _ _ 5 = i _ _  , + & & _ _ = i ( _ g _ - _ g _ ) + _ _ _ 5  .",

    "we would like to make the following remark . as we noted earlier , the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent twist @xmath74 contributions to the two - particle photon wave function .",
    "to this accuracy , in eq.(19 ) we must take into account other twist @xmath67 photon wave functions ( see for example @xcite ) . using the equation of motion",
    ", one can relate them to the three - particle wave functions of twist @xmath74 with an additional gluon from heavy quark @xcite .",
    "but , these three - particle wave function contributions , in general , are small and we will neglect them in further analysis .",
    "the remaining task is now to match eqs.(18 ) and ( 19 ) with the corresponding hadronic representation ( see eq.(5 ) ) and to extract the formfactors @xmath37 and @xmath39 . as usual , invoking duality , we assume that above certain threshold @xmath75 ( this value follows from two - point sum rules analysis ) the spectral density @xmath76 associated with higher resonances and continuum states coincides with the spectral density from perturbative part .",
