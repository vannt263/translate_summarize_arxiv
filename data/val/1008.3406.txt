    "indeed , as we will see , some features and insights resulting from the bethe ansatz state are absent in the mean field solution .    in this paper",
    "we restrict specific calculations to the two - dimensional attractive case where a qpt with unusual characteristics signals the transition between two gapped superfluid phases , one topologically non - trivial , known as weak pairing@xcite , and another one characterized by tightly bound quasi - molecules , known as strong pairing @xcite .",

    "[ fig : hyperbolic_phasediagram ] : on the left side of the diagram one finds the weak coupling bcs region , where the pairons behave much like in the rational model : they form arcs in the complex plane .",

    "finally , for strong interactions and @xmath108 , one can pass special case ( i ) and make the transition to the strong - pairing phase . here",
    "the ground state corresponds to a configuration where all pairons are real and negative .    at the moore - read line all pairons",
    "@xmath55 converge to zero , which means that the total energy @xmath109 also goes to zero .",
    "this coincides exactly with the mean field result .",
    "the corresponding wave functions are not the same because the mean field wave function breaks pair number symmetry , and can be written as a superposition of exact zero - energy states for a range of numbers of pairs : @xmath110 while the exact wave function is given by the projection of @xmath111 onto the @xmath50-pair sector , @xmath112 just below the line , when @xmath113 , one finds that the energy of the exact eigenstate is equal to the energy @xmath114 of the one - pair state calculated in appendix  [ app : onepair ] , because of the symmetry to be shown in section [ sec : symmetry ] .",
    "increasing the number of pairs by one while maintaining @xmath115 fixed , moves the state to the moore - read line where the total energy is zero .",
    "this means that for a small increase in density , @xmath116 ( which becomes infinitesimal in the thermodynamic limit ) , there is a finite jump in energy , @xmath117 .",

    "[ app : onepair ] .",
    "therefore , the shift in energy @xmath121 resulting from a shift in density @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 which is of order @xmath120 for @xmath124 because the derivative is free of scales .",
    "this means that a jump in energy of size @xmath125 for a change in density of size @xmath126 is not a sign of a phase transition but rather a consequence of the pathological scaling behavior of the energy in this model .",
    "we would like to stress here that in order to obtain the exact solution of the pairing eigenproblem for @xmath50 pairs in a system of size @xmath73 , one has to diagonalize a hamiltonian matrix of dimension @xmath127 .",

    "this justifies labeling these models as _",
    "exactly solvable_. for instance , below we show exact results for @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which corresponds to solving an eigenvalue problem of dimension @xmath130 , while in our case each eigenvector arises as a particular solution of the @xmath131 coupled non - linear rg equations .",
    "although easily written down , actually solving eqs.([eq : sp_eigeneq ] ) for more than a few pairs turns out to be a cumbersome task due to singularities that occur when some of the pairons approach the origin or a certain level value @xmath88 , or if two or more pairons approach each other . for the rational model with all @xmath132 , where the singularities entail at most two pairons ,",
    "richardson already proposed a practical solution @xcite , by rewriting eqs.([eq : sp_eigeneq ] ) in terms of the real part of the pairon values and the square of the difference between two pairon values .",
    "if singularities with three or more pairons occur , this trick no longer works .",
    "more complicated changes of variables have been proposed to remediate this problem for the rational model @xcite , but in the hyperbolic model we are confronted with a situation where _ all _ pairons can converge to zero and where the change of variables can no longer be performed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "standard gradient methods to solve the eqs.([eq : sp_eigeneq ] ) directly run into problems because the jacobian matrix becomes ill - conditioned well before the pairons reach the singularities .",
    "our numerical strategy to solve the rg equations is to start from an educated guess for the position of the @xmath50 pairons in the weak coupling limit . in this limit",
    "the rg equations decouple into @xmath50 independent equations ( one for each level ) .",
