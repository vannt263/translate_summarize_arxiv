    "the orion nebula region has two luminous star - forming cloud cores which lie immediately behind the young ( 1 myr ) orion nebula cluster ( onc ) centered on the bright trapezium ob stars .",
    "one is the @xmath3 bn / kl region in orion molecular cloud 1 ( omc-1 ) and the other is the @xmath4 omc-1s region . the bn / kl region has a number of compact infrared sources ( irc ) , of which only bn , irc2 , and irc9 are believed to be self luminous , and are associated with a wide - angle bipolar outflow , powerful masers and ultracompact h@xmath5 regions ( see odell 2001 for a recent review ) .",
    "the omc-1s region , located @xmath6 south of the bn / kl complex , is a young and highly active star formation region .",
    "this region includes a number of deeply embedded mid - ir sources ( smith et al .",
    "2004 ) , a luminous far - ir / submillimeter source fir 4 ( mezger et al . 1990 ) , a dense molecular condensation cs 3 ( mundy et al .",
    "1986 ) , at least four molecular outflows ( ziurys et al . 1990 ; rodr@xmath7guez - franco et al . 1999",
    "; zapata et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "at least seven optical herbig - haro objects ( hh 202 , hh269 , hh529 , hh203/204 , hh530 , hh625 , and hh 528 ) originate from this region ( bally et al . 2000 ;",
    "odell & doi 2003 ) .",
    "odell & doi ( 2003 ) suggested that all the above optical herbig - haro objects ( except hh 625 and hh 530 ) originated from a region only arcseconds across in the omc-1s region , referred to as optical outflow source ( oos ) .",
    "however , no ir or radio sources are found in the oos region .",
    "therefore the exciting sources of these herbig - haro objects remain unclear .",
    "thus we conducted polarimetry in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands since infrared polarization studies could indicate the illuminating / exciting sources of the infrared nebulae and the outflows ( nagata et al .",

    "we report the discovery of several infrared reflection nebulae ( irne ) .",
    "we also discuss the exciting source candidates of the optical herbig - haro objects in the omc-1s region .",
    "near infrared ( nir ) polarization images were obtained on 2005 december 26 with the nir camera sirius , a simultaneous three - color infrared imager for unbiased survey ( nagayama et al . 2003 ) and its polarimeter mounted on the irsf , 1.4 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory in sutherland , south africa .",
    "the image scale of the array is 0@xmath845 pixel@xmath9 , giving a field of view of @xmath10 .",
    "the polarimeter is composed of an achromatic ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath11 m ) waveplate rotator and a polarizer unit which are located upstream of the camera .",
    "more details are described elsewhere ( kandori et al .",
    "the polarizations were measured by stepping the half waveplate to four angular positions ( 0@xmath12 , 45@xmath12 , 22.5@xmath12 and 67.5@xmath12 ) .",
    "10 dithered frames were observed per waveplate position , and we observed 9 sets for the object , giving @xmath13 frames of 10 s integration per waveplate position .",
    "seeing conditions were @xmath14 1@xmath85 ( fwhm ) in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner of infrared image reduction : subtracting a dark - frame and dividing by a flat - frame .",
    "in addition , the data for each waveplate position ( @xmath15 ) were registered , and then combined .",
    "stokes @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 parameters , degree of polarization ( @xmath19 ) , and position angle ( @xmath20 ) are calculated as follows ( see e.g. , tamura et al .",
    "@xmath21 for the region of @xmath22 of omc-1s , the polarized intensity images , and polarization vector images in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands obtained with the above calculations are shown in figure [ image](b ) and figures [ vector](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the entire field ( @xmath10 ) of the data is discussed elsewhere ( tamura et al .",
    "figures [ image](a ) and ( b ) show how the total intensity and polarization images differ from each other . both figures [ image](a ) and ( b ) are color - composite images in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 & @xmath2 bands ( @xmath0 : blue , @xmath1 : green , @xmath2 : red ) which are constructed with the calculations in @xmath23 . in figure [ image](b )",
    ", there are several nebulae in the yellow box region , which are much more clearly seen than in figure [ image](a ) .",
    "this is because they are obscured by a diffuse nebula in the intensity image .",
    "we identify them as irne and refer to them as irn 1 to 6 as shown in figure [ hh ] .",
    "figures [ vector](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show polarization vector images superposed on the intensity image in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands in a yellow box region in figure [ image](b ) , respectively . in figures [ vector](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , the polarization vectors show different centrosymmetric patterns suggesting that irn 1 & 2 , irn 3 , 4 , & 5 , and irn 6 are illuminated by three independent sources . in order to identify these sources",
    ", we plotted the nir ( 3.6 @xmath11 m ) , mir ( 8.8 , 11.7 , and 18.75 @xmath11 m ) and radio ( co 2 @xmath24 1 ) sources in figure [ vector](d ) .",
    "we refer to these sources as marked in figure [ vector](d ) , e.g. source 144 - 351 .",
    "the nir , mir , and radio sources are detected by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and zapata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , respectively .",
    "in addition , we plotted the vectors in the @xmath2 band rotated by 90@xmath12 in figure [ vector](d ) , since the direction normal to each polarization vector indicates the source of illumination .",
    "the convergence of these lines show that source 144 - 351 , source 145 - 356 , and source 136 - 355 are most likely to be the sources of illumination for irn 1 & 2 , irn 3 , 4 , & 5 , and irn 6 , respectively .",
    "since diffuse radiation from the trapezium cluster is not negligible in the @xmath0 & @xmath1 bands ( tamura et al .",
    "2006 ) , we only use the vectors in the @xmath2 band in order to identify the source of illumination .",
    "we consider that these irne correspond to the walls of the outflow material , since a close relationship has been suggested between irn and co bipolar outflow ( nagata et al .",
    "1983 ; hodapp 1984 ; sato et al .",
    "1985 ; yamashita et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the relationship is that these outflows are or were powerful enough to open a cavity within their parent molecular cloud , in a direction that tends to be perpendicular to the optically thick circumstellar disk , allowing radiation from the star to escape along the polar directions , and then be scattered off dust grains associated with a bipolar outflow .",
    "indeed , viewed at low spatial resolution , the extension of irn tends to be consistent with that of co outflow .    based on this interpretation , a suggested geometry of each outflow and associated irn",
    "is depicted in figure [ vector](d ) ; the blue and red cones means blueshifted and redshifted outflows , respectively .",
    "irn 6 associated with source 136 - 355 has a clear mono - pole structure , which means that irn 6 corresponds to a blueshifted outflow .",
    "the redshifted counterpart irn is probably obscured and invisible .",
    "other examples of such mono - polar irne are r mon ( aspin et al .",
    "1985 ) , cep a ( jones et at .",
    "2004 ) , and gl 2591 ( minchin et al . 1991 ) .",
    "irn 3 & irn 4 have a bipolar structure extending north - west to south - east ; we suggest that irn 3 corresponds to a blueshifted outflow and irn 4 corresponds to a redshifted outflow .",
    "this is because irn 3 is detected in all of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands , while irn 4 is only in the @xmath2 band , which suggests a heavier extinction toward irn 4 .",
    "similarly , we consider that irn 1 and irn 2 have a likely bipolar structure extending east to west ; we suggest a blueshifted outflow component in irn 2 and a redshifted outflow component probably in irn 1 .",
    "this is because irn 1 is redder than irn 2 in figure [ image](b ) .",
    "in addition , the small region of irn 5 seems to be associated with a local high density region .",
    "table [ degree ] summarizes the measured maximum degrees of polarization in irn 1 to 6 . subtracting the local background polarization , which is determined at ( @xmath2510@xmath26 , 10@xmath26 ) in figures 2 , produced larger degrees of polarization in the irne .",
    "however , this had little effect on the geometry of the centrosymmetric polarization patterns .",
    "this is most likely to be due to the contribution of unpolarized ionized gas emission in the background diffuse radiation .",
    "although the apparent polarization of these irne is small ( a few % ) , the level of degrees of polarization after the background subtraction is comparable to that of other irne such as gl 2591 ( @xmath27 in the @xmath28 band ; minchin et al .",

    "figure [ hh ] shows the polarization vector map superposed on polarized intensity image in the @xmath2 band , together with the directions of the hh outflows , and the optical outflow source ( oos ) suggested by odell & doi ( 2003 ) , marked with an error bar ( 1@xmath26.5 @xmath30 1@xmath26.5 ) .",
    "here we discuss possible associations between these outflows and the embedded sources indicated in  [ discuss ] , based on our polarization data and direction of irne .",
    "_ hh 529 . _",
    " hh 529 is blueshifted ( walter et al . 1995 ) , and extended to the east from omc-1s at pa @xmath31 .",
    "the direction of hh 529 corresponds approximately to the extension of irn 2 .",
    "hence we conclude that hh 529 originates from source 144 - 351 .",
    "_ hh 269 . _",
    " hh 269 is also blueshifted ( walter et al . 1995 ) , and extended in the west at pa @xmath32 .",
    "recently , zapata et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found a sio bipolar outflow extended in the east and west from source 136 - 355 , and concluded that the blueshifted sio outflow at pa @xmath32 could be powering hh 269 .",
    "however , we found irn 6 extended to the southwest from source 136 - 355",
    ". there might be an another source powering hh 269 behind source 136 - 355 which illuminates irn 6 .",
    "_  hh 202 is one of the first hh objects to be recognized in the orion nebula ( canto et al .",

    "2001 ) , extending at pa @xmath33 .",

    "_  hh 528 has a low - velocity redshifted component ( smith et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , where they suggested that hh 530 originated from the fir 4/cs 3 region located @xmath37 south of source 136 - 355 , since the highly collimated , low velocity redshifted co outflow from the fir 4/cs 3 region was reported in schmid - burgk et al .",
    "however , hh 530 is not aligned in the direction of the measured low - velocity outflow .",
    "hence we consider that hh 530 originates from source 136 - 355 since the direction of hh 530 corresponds approximately to the extension of irn 6 .",
