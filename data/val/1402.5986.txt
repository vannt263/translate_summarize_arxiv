    "the origin of the thick discs is , however , still an open question , and a number of possible formation scenarios have been proposed so far .",

    "@xcite has pointed out the possibility of thick - disc formation in such a clumpy phase of galaxy evolution : orbital motions of giant clumps kinematically can heat up a galactic disc , and disrupted clumps supply stars to the thick disc to some extent .",
    "afterwards , @xcite demonstrated it by numerical simulations .",
    "their numerical simulations showed that the clumpy disc scenario can reproduce observed thick discs with exponential density profiles ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and scale heights independent from radius .",
    "thick discs of external galaxies were indeed observed to have a constant thickness @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the reproducibility of the constant thickness is a characteristic point of this formation scenario ; the thin - disc thickening by minor mergers lead to flaring of thick discs in outer disc regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observations also seemed to show that the disc - like structures in the clumpy galaxies are consistent with thick discs in nearby galaxies in their thickness and age @xcite , and spatial distributions of clumps are nearly exponential although surface brightness profiles of the discs are clearly not @xcite .",

    "[ originmass ] indicates that more than 50 per cent of the thick - disc stars form in clumps more massive than @xmath106 in the runs of b01-@xmath47004 and k11-@xmath47004 although the fractions are @xmath107 per cent in b01-@xmath47010 and k11-@xmath47010 . therefore , it could be expected that the thick - disc properties in b01-@xmath47004 and k11-@xmath47004 would be robust with respect to the feedback efficiency in simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "the thick discs in b01-@xmath47010 and k11-@xmath47010 may not be formed from dissolved clumps if the other feedback processes are implemented . moreover ,",
    "bulge masses could also be affected by the feedback .",
    "if the feedback dissolves the majority of clumps , the bulges could not grow massive . in this sense ,",
    "contribution by the bulges to potentials of entire galaxies may depend on the strength of the feedback , thereby the feedback efficiency may be influential on dynamical properties of disc stars via the bulge potentials .",
    "significance of the metallicity gradients would be affected by the strength of feedback .",
    "cosmological simulations of @xcite have demonstrated that strong stellar feedback can wash out metallicity gradients in their discs although the gradients can be seen in the case of weak feedback .",
    "our simulations would correspond to the case of weak feedback , therefore we could expect that the weak metallicity relations in this study would be due to the violent perturbation by the massive clumps .",
    "however , metallicity of the disc stars would become lower than in our simulations if the other feedback processes are implemented since star formation would be considerably suppressed and metal - enriched gas in clumps would be discharged by the feedback .",
    "our simulations are , in addition , not cosmological ; our models are lacking continuous gas accretion which is expected to feed thin discs .",
    "the thin - disc formation could shorten the scale heights of the thick discs and might influence the velocity dispersions . in the cosmological context , smooth and cold gas streams are thought to penetrate a halo and keep a galaxy gas - rich until the streams are turned off in the high - redshift universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as noted in",
    " [ radialprofiles ] , gas fraction in the clumps may affect some properties of the clump - origin bulges such as density profile and mass . in isolated models like our simulations , properties of giant clumps would be more or less controlled by the initial settings .",
    "for example , spin parameter is responsible for mass function of clumps : small and large spin parameters of the initial conditions lead to high and low surface gas density of the discs .",
    "the wavelength at which dynamical instability first appears becomes longer in a disc with a higher surface density , which allows to form more massive clumps preferentially @xcite .",
    "this inference can be seen in fig.[originmass ] : in b01-@xmath47010 and k11-@xmath47010 , more clumps of @xmath108 formed than in the runs of b01-@xmath47004 and k11-@xmath47004 . as we showed in  [ results ] , however , the kinematic and chemical properties of the thick discs in our simulations are qualitatively consistent between the runs and do not seem to depend very much on the initial conditions .",
    "here we inspect how realistic the scenario of thick - disc formation in clumpy galaxies is .",
    "as @xcite showed , the thick - disc formation in clumpy galaxies has the advantages that constant thickness and old age of thick discs can be well reproduced in agreement with observations .",
    "these were confirmed in our simulations . in the scenarios of thin disc heating and radial migration ,",
    "thick discs seem to form with scale heights increasing with galactocentric radius , i.e. flaring thick discs @xcite , although radial migration seems able to explain the relation between @xmath87 and metallicity @xcite . in our simulations , although the scale radii of the discs were contingent to the initial rotation of gas , the scale heights of @xmath109 seem to be consistent with observed thick discs and almost independent of the initial conditions .",
    "significant asymmetric drift , @xmath110 , was also confirmed in the runs of b01-@xmath47004 and k11-@xmath47004 .",
    "radial profiles of velocity dispersions except @xmath65 were also nearly exponential . the pioneering work of @xcite has observed exponential decrease of @xmath65 and @xmath2 for old disc stars with scale lengths similar to that of surface density , whereas @xcite observed the only significant radial gradient of @xmath3 in the mw thick - disc stars .",
    "moreover , we found that vertical profiles of velocity dispersions are almost isothermal in our simulations . in observations of the mw thick disc , @xcite",
    "have observed velocity dispersion profiles weakly increasing with height above the plane ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , some observations indicated steep vertical gradients of @xmath65 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "distributions of orbital eccentricities in the entire thick discs in our simulations showed excellent agreement with observations of the mw thick disc .",
    "however , vertical dependence of the eccentricities can not be reproduced .",
    "thus , we can see that the comparisons of dynamical properties between our simulations and the observations do not indicate evident discrepancies , except the vertical variation of orbital eccentricities observed in the mw @xcite .",
    "we found that metallicity gradients are quite weak in our simulations . in observations of the mw",
    ", thick - disc stars do not seem to have steep metallicity gradients in radial or vertical directions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , our simulations did not show metallicity relations with orbital eccentricities and rotation velocities , which have recently been observed in the mw thick disc @xcite .",
    "we consider that this lack of chemo - dynamical relations is the most striking discrepancy between our simulations and the observations .",
    "we infer that disc stars are stirred by violent perturbation of giant clumps and such chemo - dynamical relations would be washed out in the clumpy phase .",
    "in the observations of @xcite , their samples of thin- and thick - disc stars showed distinct chemo - dynamical relations , this is thought to reflect distinct formation processes of these discs .",
    "thus , the chemical relations are expected to be susceptible to formation scenarios of discs , and the inconsistency between our simulations and the observations of the mw implies that the thick - disc formation scenario in clumpy galaxies may not be suitable for the mw .",
    "@xcite have observed that 41 per cent of h@xmath4 emitters of stellar masses from @xmath111 to @xmath112 have clumpy morphologies at redshifts of 2.2 and 2.5 , and the fraction of clumpy galaxies becomes the largest at the mass of @xmath113 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite observationally argued that mw progenitors would have stellar masses of @xmath114@xmath115 in this redshift range ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) . from these observations , typical clumpy galaxies may be too massive to evolve into the mw - size galaxies .",
    "if it is the case , the thick - disc formation in a clumpy disc would not be suitable for the mw and smaller galaxies .",
    "it should be noted , however , that thick discs in external galaxies show a wide variety of kinematic properties , which is discussed to correlate with hubble types and/or galaxy masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "presumably , this may mean that the formation process of thick discs is not a single scenario and the diverse kinematics of the thick discs could be the consequence of the variety of formation history .",
    "observational studies of chemo - dynamical properties of thick - disc stars in external galaxies are , unfortunately , far from sufficient .",
    "first , orbital eccentricity of each thick - disc star is not observable in these galaxies since three - dimensional position and velocity of a star are not accessible even if we could resolve its stellar image .",
    "however , it may be possible to observe the relation between metallicity and rotation velocity .",
    "@xcite have observed some edge - on galaxies and obtained rotation curves at different height above disc planes .",
    "they found that relatively massive galaxies in their sample do not indicate significant vertical gradient of rotation velocities . on the other hand ,",
    "their less massive galaxies show a wide range of behaviour such as counter - rotation between thin and thick discs , but they tend to indicate asymmetric drift more clearly than the massive galaxies . if altitudinal dependence of metallicity is observed in these galaxies , one can discuss whether they have a chemo - dynamical relation like the mw thick disc and whether it is a universal relation or not .",
    "the authenticity of the clear distinction between the thin and thick discs is still under discussion , and the galactic thick disc may be a superposition of relatively old components which are continuously connected to the thin disc ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite discussed that each component consisting of the galactic disc is a simple structure with a single exponential density profile and isothermal kinematics .",
    "recent observations by @xcite , however , indicated that the galactic thick- and thin - disc stars have obviously distinguishable age-@xmath116 and -@xmath81 relations although the durations of their star formation somewhat overlap .",
    "their result would prefer distinct formation processes between the thin and thick discs .",
    "they discussed the formation epoch of the thick disc to be the first @xmath117@xmath118 of the galaxy formation with starburst ; this period corresponds to redshift of @xmath119@xmath120 .",
    "thus , further investigation is needed to obtain more detailed and accurate information for the galactic thick disc .",
    "in addition , observations for external galaxies are also essential to compare with the mw and inspect the universality and individuality of thick discs .",
    "in this study , we found that properties of thick discs are almost consistent among our runs with different initial conditions .",
    "our simulations indicated that kinematic properties such as density and velocity profiles and distributions of orbital eccentricities are in acceptable agreement with galactic and external galactic observations .",
    "however , altitudinal dependence of the eccentricities and metallicity relations with rotation velocities and eccentricities are not confirmed in our simulations , which are discrepant from recent observations of the galactic thick disc .",
    "therefore , we infer that the thick - disc formation scenario by clumpy discs would not be suitable at least for the mw .",
