    "the analysis of the josephson effect in this two - mode exactly soluble model may provide a clue for the examination of macroscopic coupling arising in less tractable form of the general theory of becs @xcite .    whereas in real experiments the trap potential may be considered to be a time - independent function , excepting for small fluctuations ,",

    "we finally observe that , evidently , these td effects have direct implications on the population imbalance and relative phase between the condensates .",
    "in this section we analyze the two - mode condensates from a different perspective : as a single atomic specie trapped in a symmetric or asymmetric double - well potential .",
    "as the internal josephson effect is here substituted by the tunneling interaction , the laser pumping becomes unnecessary and we impose that @xmath157 , such that @xmath234 .",
    "moreover , in the external josephson effect the interspecies collision rate correspond to a second order correction compared to the intraspecies collision rates , justifying the assumption that @xmath235 @xcite .",

    "the solutions of the characteristic equations for the asymmetric wells follow by imposing constant values for the effective frequency @xmath238 ( since @xmath157 ) and the tunneling rate @xmath239 .",
