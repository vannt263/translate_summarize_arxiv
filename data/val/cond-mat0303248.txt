    "the two - channel kondo effect  @xcite is a prototype for non - fermi - liquid behavior in correlated electron systems .",
    "it occurs when a spin-@xmath1 local moment is coupled antiferromagnetically to two identical , independent conduction - electron channels . below a characteristic energy scale , @xmath2 ,",
    "the system is governed by an intermediate - coupling non - fermi - liquid fixed point , representing the fact that neither conduction - electron channel can exactly screen the impurity moment .",
    "the resulting low - energy physics is characterized by anomalous thermodynamic and dynamic properties .",
    "@xcite hampering the quest for an experimental realization of the two - channel kondo effect is the extreme instability of the non - fermi - liquid fixed point against various perturbations .",
    "any channel asymmetry , however small , drives the system to a fermi - liquid fixed point , as does the application of a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite hence the observation of a fully developed two - channel kondo effect appears hopeless , unless one is able to identify a system where the equivalence of the two conduction - electron channels is guaranteed by symmetry , and all relevant perturbations , such as an applied magnetic field , can be tuned to zero .",
    "one of the leading scenarios for the realization of the two - channel kondo effect is that of a quantum box , either a small metallic grain or a large semiconducting quantum dot , weakly connected to a lead by a single - mode point contact . near the degeneracy points of the coulomb - blockade staircase ,",
    "one can map the charge fluctuations in the quantum box onto a planner two - channel kondo hamiltonian ,  @xcite with the two available charge configurations in the box playing the role of the impurity spin , and the physical spin of the conduction electrons acting as a passive channel index .",
    "the energy difference between the two charge configurations corresponds in this mapping to an effective magnetic field , which can be tuned to zero by varying the gate voltage .",
    "indeed , some signatures of the two - channel kondo effect were recently observed for such a setting in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "@xcite    however , as recently emphasized by zarnd _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite measurement of the low - temperature , non - fermi - liquid regime of the two - channel kondo effect sets opposite constraints on the size of the quantum box . on the one hand ,",
    "the charging energy must be sufficiently large in order for a measurable kondo temperature to emerge , limiting the box from being too large . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean level spacing in the box must be sufficiently small compared to @xmath2 , as not to cut off the approach to the non - fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "hence the box can not be too small . as argued by zarnd _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite these conflicting limitations can not be simultaneously realized in present - day semiconducting devices .",
    "the alternate possibility of using metallic grains is faced with a different difficulty of fabricating stable atomic - size contacts , which are required for obtaining a measurable @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite hence the prospects for obtaining a fully developed two - channel kondo effect within matveev s original picture remain unclear .    in this paper",
    "we show that the two - channel kondo temperature @xmath0 , and thus the chances for observing the two - channel kondo effect , can be greatly enhanced if tunneling between the lead and the box takes place via a single resonant level .",
    "the study of such resonant tunneling was initiated by gramespacher and matveev ,  @xcite who showed that one can have a nearly perfect coulomb staircase , even if the transmission coefficient through the impurity is one at the fermi energy .",
    "this differs markedly from the case of an energy - independent transmission coefficient , where the coulomb staircase is washed out for perfect transmission .",
    "@xcite here we resolve the shape of the coulomb step separating two neighboring charge plateaus , for the case of tunneling through a resonant level .",
    "using combined analytical and numerical techniques we find that the shape of the step is governed at low temperatures by the non - fermi - liquid fixed point of the two - channel kondo effect , similar to the case of a weak tunnel barrier .",
    "@xcite however , the associated kondo temperature is strongly modified .",
    "most notably , @xmath0 is no longer exponentially small in one over the tunneling matrix element if the transmission through the impurity is close to unity at the fermi energy , but rather is proportional to the width of the level . in general",
    ", @xmath0 strongly depends on the ratio of the tunneling rates to the box and to the lead , which illustrates the inequivalent roles of the two rates .",
    "if the level is at resonance with the fermi energy , this ratio defines the crossover from weak to strong coupling .",
    "the dependences of @xmath0 on the tunneling rates and on the energy of the level are analyzed in detail , as are the position and shape of the charge step .",
    "a potential concern with the above setting has to do with the effect of an on - site coulomb repulsion on the impurity level , as it couples the two spin channels .",
    "modeling the interacting level by a symmetric anderson impurity , we show that the two - channel kondo effect is robust against the inclusion of a coulomb repulsion on the impurity level , and that @xmath0 is enhanced by a moderately large repulsion in the mixed - valent regime . for a large on - site repulsion , a local magnetic moment",
    "is formed on the level . in this regime",
    ", @xmath0 decays exponentially with on one over the tunneling rates .",

    "hence , not much can be gained from a symmetric level , as the associated kondo temperature @xmath0 is exponentially small in @xmath428 .",
    "instead , one would like to tune the level to the mixed - valent regime , where @xmath0 is expected to be of the order of the level broadening .",
    "as emphasized above , treatment of such an asymmetric level is complicated by the need to accurately locate the position of the degeneracy point , which is no longer pinned at @xmath86 , and does not coincide with the mid - charge point .",
    "in fact , one can not entirely rule out the possibility that the two - channel kondo effect is unstable against particle - hole asymmetry for an interacting level , as recently implied by le hur and simon .",
    "@xcite using perturbative rg and an analogy to a related model of two capacitively coupled quantum dots ,  @xcite these authors argued that the two - channel kondo is lost in the local - moment regime , when a stable local moment is formed on the level .",
    "@xcite although no explicit distinction was made between a particle - hole symmetric and an asymmetric level , the analysis of le hur and simon implicitly assumed an asymmetric level , by taking the coupling @xmath429 to be nonzero ( see ref .  ) .",

    "the system continues to show the two - channel kondo effect , albeit at a shifted position of the degeneracy point .",
    "this differs from the conclusion of le hur and simon for the local - moment regime .",
    "away from weak coupling , a full - scale numerical effort is required to resolve the effect of particle - hole asymmetry on the emergence of the two - channel kondo effect .",
    "such a study is currently under way .",
    "our preliminary results for the mixed - valent regime ( setting @xmath4 equal to zero ) support the conclusion that the two - channel kondo effect is robust against particle - hole asymmetry for an interacting level .",
