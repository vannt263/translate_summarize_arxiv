    "in 2000 , experiments  @xcite at low temperatures ( @xmath1 k ) and high pressure ( @xmath2 gpa ) demonstrated the existence of spin triplet superconducting states in the metallic compound uge@xmath0 .",
    "the superconductivity is triggered by the spontaneous magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase that occurs at much higher temperatures .",
    "it coexists with the superconducting phase in the whole domain of its existence below @xmath1 k ; see also experiments from refs .",
    "@xcite , and the discussion in ref .",
    "the same phenomenon of existence of superconductivity at low temperatures and high pressure in the domain of the @xmath3 phase diagram where the ferromagnetic order is present was observed in other ferromagnetic metallic compounds ( zrzn@xmath0  @xcite and urhge  @xcite ) soon after the discovery  @xcite of superconductivity in uge@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to other superconducting materials , as ternary and chevrel compounds , where the influence of magnetic order on superconductivity is also substantial ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in these ferromagnetic substances the phase transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) to the ferromagnetic state is much higher than the phase transition temperature ( @xmath5 from ferromagnetic to a mixed state of coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "for example , in uge@xmath0 , @xmath6 k while the critical temperature of the phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state in the same material is @xmath7k",
    "it can be assumed that in these substances the material parameter @xmath8 defined as the usual critical temperature of the second order phase transition from normal to uniform ( meissner ) supercondicting state in a zero external magnetic field is much lower than the phase transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the above mentioned experiments on the compounds  uge@xmath10 , urhge , and zrzn@xmath0 do not give any evidence for the existence of a standard normal - to - superconducting phase transition in a zero external magnetic field .",
    "it seems that the superconductivity in the metallic compounds mentioned above always coexists with the ferromagnetic order and is enhanced by it . in these systems , as claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the superconductivity probably arises from the same electrons that create the band magnetism and can be most naturally understood rather as a triplet than spin - singlet pairing phenomenon .",
    "metallic compounds uge@xmath10 , urhge , and zrzn@xmath0 , are itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "an unconventional superconductivity is also suggested  @xcite as a possible outcome of recent experiments in fe  @xcite , in which a superconducting phase has been discovered at temperatures below @xmath11 k and pressures between 15 and 30 gpa .",
    "there both vortex and meissner superconductivity phases  @xcite are found in the high - pressure crystal modification of fe with a hexagonal close - packed lattice for which the strong ferromagnetism of the usual bcc iron crystal probably disappears  @xcite .",
    "it can be hardly claimed that in hexagonal fe the ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist but the clear evidence for a superconductivity is also a remarkable achievement .",
    "the reasonable question whether these examples of superconductivity and coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism are bulk or surface effects can be stated .",
    "the earlier experiments performed before 2004 do not answer this question .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite show that surface superconductivity appears in zrzn@xmath0 and its presence depends essentially on the way of preparation of the sample .",
    "but in our study it is important that bulk superconductivity can be considered well established in this substance .",
    "a phenomenological theory that explains the coexistence of ferromagnetism and unconventional spin - triplet superconductivity of landau - ginzburg type has been developed recently in  @xcite where possible low - order couplings between the superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters are derived with the help of general symmetry group arguments . on this basis several important features of the superconducting vortex state of unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors were established  @xcite .",
    "in our paper we shall follow the approach from refs .",
    "@xcite to investigate the conditions for the occurrence of the meissner phase and to demonstrate that the presence of ferromagnetic order enhances the @xmath12-wave superconductivity .",
    "we also establish the phase diagram of ferromagnetic superconductors in a zero external magnetic field and show that the phase transition to the superconducting state can be either of first or second order depending on the particular substance .",
    "we confirm the predictions made in refs .",
    "@xcite about the symmetry of the ordered phases .",
    "our investigation is based on the mean - field approximation  @xcite as well as on known results about the possible phases in nonmagnetic superconductors with triplet ( @xmath12-wave ) pairing  @xcite .",
    "we extend our preceding results  @xcite and show that taking into account the anisotropy of the spin - triplet cooper pairs modifies but does not drastically change the thermodynamic properties of the coexistence phase , especially in the temperature domain above the superconducting critical temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the effect of crystal anisotropy is similar but we shall not make an overall thermodynamic analysis of this problem because we have to consider concrete systems and crystal structures  @xcite for which there is no enough information from experiment to make conclusions about the parameters of the theory .",
    "our results confirm the general concept that the anisotropy reduces the degree of ground state degeneration , and depending on the symmetry of the crystal , picks up a crystal direction for the ordering .",
    "there exists a formal similarity between the phase diagram we obtain and the phase diagram of certain improper ferroelectrics  @xcite .",
    "we shall make use of the concept in the theory of improper ferroelectrics , where the trigger of the primary order parameter by a secondary order parameter ( the electric polarization ) has been initially introduced and exploited ; see ref .",
    "the mechanism of the m - triggered superconductivity in itinerant ferromagnets is formally identical to the mechanism of appearance of structural order triggered by the electric polarization in improper ferroelectrics .",
    "our aim is to establish the uniform phases which are described by the gl free energy presented in sec .",
    "we investigate a quite general gl model in a situation of a lack of concrete information about the values of the parameters of this model for concrete compounds ( uge@xmath0 , urhge , zrzn@xmath0 ) where the ferromagnetic superconductivity has been discovered . on the one hand the lack of information makes impossible a detailed comparison of the theory to available experimental data but on the other hand our results are not bound to one or more concrete substances and can be applied to any unconventional ferromagnetic superconductor . in sec .",

    "these conditions are directly satisfied in type i superconductors but in type ii superconductors the temperature should be sufficiently low and the external magnetic field should be zero . nevertheless , in type ii superconductors these requirements for the appearance of uniform superconducting states may turn insufficient in materials having very high values of the spontaneous magnetization . in this case",
    "the uniform ( meissner ) superconductivity and , hence , its coexistence with uniform ferromagnetic order may not occur even at zero temperature .",
    "up to now type i unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors are not found experimentally .",

    "besides , and this seems to be the main anisotropy effect , the @xmath451- and @xmath452-terms in the free energy lead to a stabilization of the order along the main crystal directions which , in other words , means that the degeneration of the possible ground states ( fm , sc , and fs ) is considerably reduced .",
    "this means also a smaller number of marginally stable states .",
    "the dimensionless anisotropy parameter @xmath453 can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath454 . obviously when @xmath455 , the parameter @xmath451 will be positive too and will be in the interval @xmath456 w@xmath457 to ensure the positiveness of parameter @xmath458 from eq .",
    "when @xmath459 , the latter condition is obeyed if the original parameters of free energy ( 3 ) satisfy the inequality @xmath460 .",
    "we should mention here that a new phase of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism occurs as a solution of eqs .",
    "it is defined in the following way : @xmath461,\\\\ \\nonumber m^2&= & \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma_1 ^ 2}\\left[\\gamma_1r-(t+\\frac{\\gamma^2}{2w } ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath462 in the present approximation the phase  ( 57)-(58 ) is unstable , but this may be changed when crystal anisotropy is taken into account .",
    "we shall write the equations for order parameters @xmath108 and @xmath100 of fs phase in order to illustrate the changes when @xmath463 @xmath464    and @xmath465m\\pm \\frac{\\gamma r}{2}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the meaning of the upper and lower sign is the same as explained just below eq .",
    "the difference in the stability conditions is more pronounced and gives new effects that will be explained further , @xmath466 @xmath467 and    @xmath468    the calculations of the phase diagram in ( @xmath469 ) parameter space are done in the same way as in case of @xmath309 and show that for @xmath470 there is no qualitative change of the phase diagram .",
    "quantitatively , the region of first order phase transition widens both with respect to @xmath129 and @xmath140 as illustrated in fig .",
    "6 . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath471 the first order phase transition region becomes more narrow but the condition  ( 62 ) limits the stability of fs for @xmath318 .",
    "this is seen from fig .",
    "7 where fs is stable above the straight dotted line for @xmath141 and @xmath139 .",
    "so , purely superconducting ( meissner ) phases occur also as ground states together with fs and fm phases .",
    "we investigated the m - trigger effect in unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "this effect arises from the @xmath472-coupling term in the gl free energy and brings into existence a superconductivity in a domain of the system s phase diagram that is entirely occupied by the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and ferromagnetic order is possible for temperatures above and below the critical temperature @xmath8 , that corresponds to the standard second - order phase transition from normal to meissner phase  usual uniform superconductivity in a zero external magnetic field which occurs outside the domain of existence of ferromagnetic order .",
    "our investigation has been mainly intended to clarify the thermodynamic behavior at temperatures @xmath473 where the superconductivity can not appear without the mechanism of m - triggering .",
    "we have described the possible ordered phases ( fm and fs ) in this most interesting temperature interval .",
    "the cooper pair and crystal anisotropies have also been investigated and their main effects on the thermodynamics of the triggered phase of coexistence is established . in discussions of concrete real material",
    "one should consider the respective crystal symmetry .",
    "but when the low symmetry and low order ( in both @xmath108 and @xmath14 ) @xmath204-term is present in the free energy , the dependence of essential thermodynamic properties on the type of crystal symmetry is not substantial .",
    "below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath8 a variety of pure superconducting and mixed phases of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism exists and the thermodynamic behavior at these relatively low temperatures is more complex than in known cases of improper ferroelectrics .",
    "the case @xmath474 also needs a special investigation .",
    "the relation of the present investigation to properties of real ferromagnetic compounds , such as uge@xmath0 , urhge , and zrzn@xmath0 , has been discussed throughout the text . in these compounds",
    "the ferromagnetic critical temperature is much larger than the superconducting critical temperature @xmath475 and that is why the m - triggering of the spin - triplet superconductivity is very strong .",
    "moreover , the @xmath305-term is important to stabilize the fm order up to the absolute zero ( 0 k ) , as is in the known spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "ignoring  @xcite the symmetry conserving @xmath305-term does not allow a proper description of the known real substances of this type .",
    "more experimental information about the values of the material parameters ( @xmath476 ) included in the free energy ( 12 ) is required in order to outline the thermodynamic behavior and the phase diagram in terms of thermodynamic parameters @xmath68 and @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , a reliable knowledge about the dependence of the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath415 on the pressure @xmath61 , the value of the characteristic temperature @xmath8 and the ratio @xmath477 at zero temperature are of primary interest . + * acknowledgements * + one of us ( d.i.u . )",
