    "flat bands possess macroscopic level degeneracy because of their flat energy dispersion .",
    "they play a crucial role in important physical phenomena such as fractional quantum hall effects where a large magnetic field applied on a two dimensional electron gas induces flat landau levels @xcite .",
    "the flat band physics is also greatly enriched recently by studying various lattice models where flat bands can be generated through geometrical frustration of hopping @xcite ( e.g. kagome lattice ) , the destructive interference between nearest - neighbor and higher - order tunnelings ( such as next - nearest - neighbor ) @xcite , or the _ p_-orbital physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , isolated flat bands in lattices with non - trivial topological properties have attracted much attention in condensed matter physics for their applications in engineering fractional topological quantum insulator neupert , sheng , sun , tang , wang , xiao , yfw without landau levels .",
    "however , most previous lattice models for generating flat bands involve either high orbital bands or high order tunnelings , which are generally very challenging in experiments . in this paper , we propose an experimentally feasible route for generating isolated flat bands using cold atoms in so coupled weak optical lattices .",
    "our work is motivated by the recent experimental realization of so coupling for bec @xcite , which opens a completely new avenue for exploring so coupled superfluids @xcite .",

    ", the minimum of the lowest bloch band locates at the center of the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , while the maximum at the edge @xcite . in so coupled optical lattices",
    ", the minimum may locate at the edge and the peak at the center .",
    "the height of the central peak can be reduced with increasing zeeman field , leading to decreasing band width and flat bands in certain parameter region .",
    "we note that such flat band dispersion has been observed very recently in experiments in so coupled optical lattices using @xmath0li fermi atoms martin .",
    "we first investigate a single atom in a 1d so coupled weak optical lattice to illustrate the mechanism for generating isolated flat bands . the atom - atom interaction in bec",
    "is then taken into account using the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( g - p ) equation @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear interaction reduces the band flatness , but does not fully destroy the isolated flat bands .",
    "the combination of nonlinear interaction and flat bands may lead to rich and interesting physics .",
    "in particular , the instability of the nonlinear bloch waves is very important because it directly relates to the breakdown of superfluidity of the bec biaowu1,biaowu2,smerzi , machholm , burger , fallani , morsch , hooley , dutton , matt , modugno . in so coupled optical lattices ,",
    "the non - zero momentum of the energy minimum of the lowest bloch band and the existence of flat bands make their stability very different from regular optical lattices . for instance",

    "iii , we discuss the effects of mean - field interactions and analyzes the stability of the bec in so coupled optical lattices .",
    "iv is the conclusion .",
    "we consider a bec confined in a 1d optical lattice potential @xmath1 along the _ x _ direction with @xmath2 as the lattice depth . in experiments ,",

    "the so coupling for bec has been realized in experiments using two counter - propagating raman lasers @xcite , yielding the single particle hamiltonian @xmath6where @xmath7 is the atom momentum along the _ x _ direction , and @xmath8 is the pauli matrix .",

    "@xmath13 is the rabi frequency and acts as a zeeman field .",
    "the units of the energy and length are chosen as the recoil energy @xmath14 , and @xmath15 respectively for the numerical calculation . under these units , the single - particle hamiltonian is dimensionless with @xmath16 and the optical lattice potential @xmath17 .    without optical lattice potentials ,",
    "the single particle hamiltonian @xmath18 has two so energy bands @xmath19 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ idea]a ) due to the lift of the spin degeneracy by the so and zeeman field .",
    "a gap @xmath20 between these two bands is opened at @xmath21 by the zeeman field @xmath13 . in the lower band",
    ", there are two energy minima at @xmath22 and one peak at @xmath21 . with increasing @xmath13 , the distance between two @xmath23 shrinks , and the height of the central peak decreases .",
    "at a critical value @xmath24 and beyond , two @xmath23 merge to one point at @xmath25 , and the central peak vanishes .    , and @xmath26 are the rabi frequencies of the raman lasers for generating so coupling .",

    ", it is necessary to reduce the energy at both the edge and the center of the first bz with respect to the band minimum , which can be realized through a combination of so coupling , zeeman field and lattice potential .",
    "specifically , the periodic lattice potential can open an energy gap at the edge of the first bz , which lowers the energy difference between the edge and the band minimum ( denoted as @xmath28 ) .",
    "when the original band minimum is close to the edge , the band edge becomes the band minimum ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath29 ) . on the other hand ,",

    "if @xmath34 is close to 1 , @xmath28 should be zero and the band width is determined by the central peak height , which can be greatly reduced with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the lowest band could be very flat for certain parameter region .",

    "lays outside of the first bz . in this case , the lowest band is formed through folding the energy spectrum into the first bz ( i.e. , shift the energy band of @xmath18 by a lattice vector @xmath35 , see fig .",
    "[ idea]c ) .",
    "the band minima now locate at @xmath36 , and the physics is similar as that in @xmath30 .",
    "however , there is one major difference between @xmath31 and @xmath30 . for @xmath31 , the minimum of the lowest band first shift towards the edge of the first bz when @xmath13 increases from 0 .",
    "therefore at certain range of @xmath13 , the band minimum always stays at the band edge and the flat band can be realized by suppressing the central peak with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "we emphasize that the resulting flat band is the ground state of the so coupled lattice , which further enhances its experimental feasibility because atoms are usually adiabatically loaded to the lowest band in experiments @xcite .",
