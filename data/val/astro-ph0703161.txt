    "there is an ongoing theoretical debate about the dominant formation mechanism for giant planets .",
    "two opposite extremes exist : core accretion and disk instability . in core accretion , a solid core forms first by the collisional accumulation of planetesimals and planetary embryos , and then accretes a gaseous envelope from the protoplanetary disk gas ( mizuno 1980 ) . in the disk instability mechanism , a gaseous protoplanet forms first in a gravitationally unstable , gaseous disk ( boss 1997 ) , and then a solid core forms by the settling and coagulation of dust grains within the protoplanet .",
    "while core accretion is generally assumed to be the dominant formation mechanism for giant planets , considerable theoretical uncertainty remains about both formation mechanisms ( e.g. , durisen et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "given this murky situation , observational constraints are likely to be crucial for deciding which mechanism , if either , dominates ( boss 2006 ) .",
    "millimeter wave telescopes should be able probe the planet - forming midplanes of optically - thick disks .",
    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) may be able to directly image gaseous protoplanets formed by disk instability , or to detect the strong self - absorption of hco@xmath0 emission lines caused by these dense clumps of molecular gas ( narayanan et  al .",
    ". the latter type of detections might also be achieved by the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "here we consider the observational appearance of light scattered by the irregular surfaces of a marginally gravitationally unstable disk that is in the process of forming gaseous protoplanets by the disk instability mechanism .",
    "the disk model studied here ( from boss 2001 ) is the same as the one investigated by narayanan et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and this work thus provides an important comparision between what can be accomplished at optical and at millimeter wavelengths in terms of constraining giant planet formation mechanisms .",
    "many others have studied the observable properties of ysos ( young stellar objects ) .",
    "this includes the spectral energy distributions of unresolved sources ( e.g.   yorke , bodenheimer , & laughlin 1993 ; boss & yorke 1995 , 1996 ; wood et  al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ; robitaille et  al . 2006 ) and imaging of smooth axisymmetric disk models ( e.g.   whitney & hartmann 1992 , 1993 ; yorke et  al . 1993 ; sonnhalter , preibisch , & yorke 1995 ; kessel , yorke , & richling 1998 ; yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ; lucas et  al . 2004 ) . in this paper",
    ", we discuss high - resolution imaging of a disk undergoing a dynamical process .",
    "the basis for our modeling is a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation rather than an analytic disk model since we are interested in the perturbations that indicate activity in the disk rather than the overall emission .",
    "the disk model we adopt was calculated by boss ( 2001 ) , and is described in detail in that paper .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the disk were calculated three - dimensionally in spherical coordinates , with @xmath1 as the distance from the central star , @xmath2 as the angle with respect to the axis of the disk s rotation , and @xmath3 as the azimuthal or longitudinal angle .",
    "pressures and temperatures were calculated on a grid with @xmath4 uniformly spaced intervals in @xmath1 between 4 and 20 au and @xmath5 uniformly spaced intervals in @xmath3 between 0 and @xmath6 . in @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath7 values were sampled , with @xmath8 .",
    "the system consists of a 1 @xmath9 central protostar , surrounded by a gaseous disk of mass @xmath10 between 4 and 20 au . from an initially smooth disk ,",
    "the system was evolved several hundred years , until a gravitationally bound clump began to form . in this study",
    ", we will examine snapshots of the simulation at 335 , 339 , and 346 years .",
    "simulated scattered light images are generated by treating the surface of the disk as an isotropic scatterer , with half the incident flux being absorbed and remainder scattered isotropically .",
    "the surface of the disk is defined to be where the disk becomes optically thick to stellar irradiation .",
    "that is , if we define @xmath11 to be the optical depth , the surface is where @xmath12 .",
    "we assume the dust is well - mixed with the gas , using opacities calculated by dalessio , calvet , & hartmann ( 2001 ) for a grain size distribution with maximum grain size @xmath13 mm , power - law index of @xmath14 , with a dust temperature of 100k .",
    "they calculate the planck opacity integrated over a stellar blackbody spectrum at 4000 k as @xmath15 g@xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the peak wavelength for this spectrum is 0.73 @xmath18 m , corresponding to r - band .",
    "we treat the star as a blackbody of radius @xmath19 radiating at a temperature of @xmath20 k.    the surface is defined to be where the line - of - sight optical depth to the star is @xmath21 .",
    "this is done numerically by calculating along lines of sight from the star . to avoid numerical artifacts at the inner boundary , we skip the innermost 5 radial grid values , so that @xmath22 we assume that the density interior to @xmath23 is constant ( @xmath24 ) , so @xmath25 for a line - of - sight along a given direction @xmath26 , we calculate where the optical depth reaches 2/3 and define that to be the location of the disk surface , sampling it with a resolution of @xmath27 or @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30/n_r = 0.016 $ ] .",
    "the flux of stellar irradiation incident on the disk at a distance @xmath1 is @xmath31 the angle of incidence of stellar irradiation on the disk surface is @xmath32 where @xmath33 points from the surface to the star , and @xmath34 is normal to the surface .",
    "the finite size of the star is the reason for including the @xmath35 term . to calculate the scattered flux ,",
    "we assume that surface acts like an isotropic scatterer so that half the flux is absorbed into the disk and reprocessed into thermal radiation and the other half is scattered back out isotropically .",
    "if we define @xmath36 to be the flux emitted by the star , then we can express the scattered light emission relative to the stellar flux : @xmath37",
    "in figure [ dencompare]a , we show the simulated scattered light image of the disk as calculated above , at a time of 339 years .",
    "the flux is normalized to the stellar emission , and is displayed in the logarithm as indicated by the color bar .",
    "note that the brightest intensity is at best @xmath38 of the stellar emission , and the minimum intensity shown is @xmath39 of the stellar emission .",
    "the dark radial streaks seen in the simulated image are shadows of dense clumps at the inner boundary of the simulation , at 4 au . at the distances and scales involved in the simulation ,",
    "it is appropriate to treat the star as a point source , which is why the shadows diverge .",
    "the area interior to 4 au has been blacked out to ignore numerical artifacts at the inner boundary of the simulation .",
    "the planet - forming clump is located at the position of the white asterisk .",
    "there is no apparent correlation between the position of the forming planet and structure in the scattered light image .    in figure [ dencompare]b",
    ", we show the density structure at the disk midplane of the simulation . the density enhancement corresponding to the position of the forming planet can be clearly seen .",
    "however , the density structure at the disk s midplane bears no resemblance to the scattered light image . in figure [ dencompare]c",
    ", we show the density structure of the disk at @xmath40 , in projection .",
    "this is close to the height of the scattering surface of the disk . comparing figures [ dencompare]a and [ dencompare]b , it is readily apparent that the scattered light emission traces the density structure in these tenuous surface layers of the disk rather than probing the overall density structure in the disk .",
    "the densities displayed in figures [ dencompare]b and [ dencompare]c cover completely different ranges , demonstrating this fact .",
    "the structures seen in scattered light are corrugations created in the initially smooth surfaces of the disk from the highly dynamical evolution of a marginally gravitationally unstable disk ( boss 2001 ) .",
    "the corrugations indicate activity within the disk , even though they are not directly correlated spatially .    in figure [ psfconv ]",
    ", we demonstrate the time evolution of the scattered light image . from top to bottom , we show simulated images of the disk at 335 , 339 , and 346 years . for scale",
    ", the central blackout region has a diameter of 8 au .",
    "the intensity scale is the same as in figure [ dencompare]a and can be inferred from the contours , which indicate flux relative to the stellar emission of @xmath41 ( solid ) , @xmath42 ( dashed ) , and @xmath43 ( dotted ) .",
    "the left column shows the theoretical scattered light image , with perfect resolution , with the location of the forming planet indicated by the white asterisk .",
    "these simulated images show that the corrugations evolve on time scales of only a few years , short enough to be easily observationally detectable .",
    "such surface irregularities are seen in other disk instability simulations as well ( e.g. , boley & durisen 2006 ) and can be attributed to spiral shock fronts breaking on the disk surface .",
    "observations of features indicative of disk instability would be a major advance for planet formation theory . an 8-m class telescope with adaptive optics",
    "would be diffraction limited at @xmath44 at 1 @xmath18 m . a 30-m class telescope such as the gmt ( giant magellan telescope ) or tmt ( thirty meter telescope ) , which are expected to have first light in the next decade , would have diffraction limits of less than @xmath45 at 1 @xmath18 m .",
    "to illustrate what actual observations of our theoretical disks might look like , we have convolved the images in the left column of figure [ psfconv ] with gaussian psfs ( point spread functions ) with fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of @xmath45 ( center column ) and @xmath44 ( right column ) .",
    "we assume that the disk is face - on to the observer at 140 pc , the approximate distance of taurus .",
    "a resolution of @xmath45 is just sufficient to begin resolving the corrugations in the scattered light image , while a resolution of @xmath44 reveals only some indistinct hints of structure .",
    "the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) adaptive optics coronograph at the gemini observatory should be diffraction - limited at 1 micron with an 8-m aperture . however , its estimated performance is a contrast ratio of 13 mags , or @xmath46 at @xmath47 from the star , with decreasing performance closer to the star .",
    "this suggests that the spatial features we have modeled may not be observable with current 8-m class telescopes , and would have to wait until a 30-m class telescope such as the gmt comes online .",
    "high - contrast imaging on the gmt , which is being developed for imaging exoplanets , should be able to achieve a contrast ratio of @xmath42 at @xmath48 at 1.65@xmath18 m ( angel et  al .",
    "2006 ) . in comparison",
    ", the inner edge of the simulated disk at 4 au would be at @xmath49 from the central star .",
    "this dashed contours in figure [ psfconv ] indicate a contrast ratio of @xmath42 , so the variability in the scattered light patterns from disk instability should be observable by the gmt",
    ". optical or infrared interferometry might also be good ways to observe disk instability .",
    "this method has already been used to detect structure in the inner 1 au of some t tauri disks ( e.g.   akeson et  al .",
    ".    the temporal variations may be observable if the disk is revisited over several years .",
    "observing this phenomenon requires finding a class i yso with the right orientation and without too much obscuration by an envelope .",
    "bipolar outflows that are common to many ysos may clear away envelope material along the poles , allowing a clear view to the inner regions of the disk that are of interest .    since the contrast between the disk to the star is @xmath38 at best , temporal variations in overall brightness of the unresolved source are more likely due to stellar activity than to disk activity . if the disk is resolved , then disk activity should be readily distinguished from stellar activity since the scattered light should scale with stellar brightness .",
    "stellar activity that affects the luminosity of the star isotropically should not affect the contrast ratio between star and disk .",
    "anisotropic variations , such as cold or hot star spots , can be distinguished from disk activity because these variations will have the same period as the rotation period of the star , which is on the order of days for typical young stars .",
    "for example , hh30 is an edge - on disk system whose periodic fluctuations in brightness are caused by illumination from a hot spot on the star sweeping across the surface of the disk as the star rotates , similar to a lighthouse ( wood et  al .",
    "1998 ; wood & whitney 1998 ; cotera et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "this variability occurs on time scales of days and is periodic .",
    "in contrast , the features we have modeled vary over years and are irregular . by monitoring an object over a series of several nights",
    ", short - term effects can be filtered out and the year - to - year variations can be studied to determine if activity characteristic of disk instability is occuring .",
    "in contrast to the variability characteristic of disk instability , planet formation by core accretion should be more quiescent , resulting in a distinct shadow at the position of the forming planet core ( jang - condell 2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "the mechanisms are also separated in pre - main sequence evolutionary epochs : disk instability is expected to occur during the class i phase of star / planet formation , where there is substantial disk and envelope material infalling toward the star .",
    "core formation has a much longer expected time scale , so those signatures are detectable during the class ii phase , after the envelope has cleared but the disk still remains .",
    "since scattered light images of optically thick disks give information about the tenuous upper layers of the disk rather than the overall large - scale structure , one should be cautious when trying to infer disk structure from scattered light images .",
    "for example , the outer disk of ab aurigae ( fukagawa et  al . 2004 ) extends out to hundreds of au , and over that path length , even a small amount of material can easily block stellar illumination .",
    "this effect should be considered before drawing strong conclusions about the underlying disk structure .",
    "although scattered light emission is not directly correlated to the planet forming in the disk , the presence of structure in the scattered light emission coupled with high time variability can be an indicator of planet forming activity .",
    "we can at least identify disks where planets are forming even if we can not say exactly where in the disk it is taking place .",
    "the gmt might well be able to detect these rapid variations in scattered light on spatial scales of interest ( @xmath50 5 to 10 au ) for giant planet formation , and thus shed light on the processes occuring deep inside optically thick protoplanetary disks .",
    "emission from the disk itself at longer wavelengths should be a better probe of the overall disk structure both because the optical depth is smaller at longer wavelength and because direct emission from the disk has better contrast with respect to the star than scattered light .",
    "observations of gravitationally unstable disks in the millimeter and sub - millimeter , such as those predicted by ( narayanan et  al .",
    "2006 ) , will be a useful complement to those predicted in this paper .",
    "we thank john chambers for helpful discussions in the preparation of this paper , and our anonymous referee for helpful comments that greatly improved it .",
