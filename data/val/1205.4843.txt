    "consists in finding the extremizer of a functional that depends on fractional derivatives and/or integrals subject to some boundary conditions and possibly some extra constraints . in this work",

    "the left riemann  liouville fractional derivative of order @xmath5 , @xmath1 , is given by @xmath6.\\ ] ]    there are several different definitions for fractional derivatives , left and right , that can be found in the literature and could also be included .",
    "they posses different properties : each one of those definitions has its own advantages and disadvantages . under certain conditions they are ,",
    "however , equivalent and can be used interchangeably .",
    "there are two major approaches in the classical theory of calculus of variations . in one hand , using euler ",
    "lagrange necessary optimality conditions , we can reduce a variational problem to the study of a differential equation .",
    "hereafter , one can use either analytical or numerical methods to solve the differential equation and reach the solution of the original problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is referred as indirect methods in the literature . on the other hand",
    ", we can tackle the functional itself , directly .",
    "direct methods are used to find the extremizer of a functional in two ways : euler s finite differences and ritz methods . in the ritz method , we either restrict admissible functions to all possible linear combinations @xmath7 , with constant coefficients @xmath8 and a set of known base functions @xmath9 , or we approximate the admissible functions with such combinations . using @xmath10 and its derivatives whenever needed , one can transform the functional to a multivariate function of unknown coefficients @xmath8 . by finite differences ,",
    "however , we consider the admissible functions not on the class of arbitrary curves , but only on polygonal curves made upon a given grid on the time horizon . using an appropriate discrete approximation of the lagrangian , and substituting the integral with a sum , we can transform the main problem to the optimization of a function of several parameters : the values of the unknown function on mesh points ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indirect methods for fractional variational problems have a vast background in the literature and can be considered a well studied subject : see @xcite and references therein that study different variants of the problem and discuss a bunch of possibilities in the presence of fractional terms , euler ",
    "lagrange equations and boundary conditions .",
    "direct methods , however , to the best of our knowledge , have got less interest and are not well studied .",
    "a brief introduction of using finite differences has been made in @xcite , which can be regarded as a predecessor to what we call here an euler - like direct method .",
    "a generalization of leitmann s direct method can be found in @xcite , while @xcite discusses the ritz direct method for optimal control problems that can easily be reduced to a problem of the calculus of variations .",
    "the basic idea of direct methods is to consider the variational problem as a limiting case of a certain extremum problem of a multi - variable function .",
    "this is then an ordinary static optimization problem .",
    "the solution to the latter problem can be regarded as an approximate solution to the original variational problem .",
    "there are three major methods : euler s finite differences , ritz and kantorovich s methods .",
    "we are going to discuss the euler method briefly : see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of a finite differences method is that instead of considering the values of a functional @xmath11=\\int_a^b l(t , x(t ) , \\dot{x}(t))dt\\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , on arbitrary admissible curves , we only track the values at an @xmath14 points grid , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , in the interested time interval .",

    "in classical theory , given a derivative of certain order @xmath31 , there is a finite difference approximation of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 this is generalized to derivatives of arbitrary order and gives rise to the grnwald ",

    "the arbitrary order derivative of a function at a time @xmath38 depends on all values of that function in @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 because of the infinite sum , backward and forward difference nature of the left and right derivatives , respectively .",
