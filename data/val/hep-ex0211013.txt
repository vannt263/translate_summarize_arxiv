    "for more than 30 years , solar neutrino experiments  @xcite have been observing fewer neutrinos than what are predicted by the detailed models  @xcite of the sun .",
    "this deficit is known as the solar neutrino problem .",
    "a comparison of the predicted and observed solar neutrino fluxes for these experiments are shown in table  [ tbl : solarnuexp ] .",
    "these experiments probe different parts of the solar neutrino energy spectrum , and show an energy dependence in the observed solar neutrino flux .",
    "these observations can be explained if the solar models are incomplete or neutrinos undergo flavor transformation while in transit to the earth .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory@xcite was constructed to resolve this solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "it is capable of making simultaneous measurements of the electron - type neutrino ( @xmath1 ) flux from @xmath3b decay in the sun and the flux of all active neutrino flavors through the following reactions : @xmath14 the charged - current ( cc ) reaction on the deuteron is sensitive exclusively to @xmath1 , and the neutral - current ( nc ) reaction has equal sensitivity to all active neutrino flavors ( @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ) .",
    "elastic scattering ( es ) on electron is also sensitive to all active flavors , but with reduced sensitivity to @xmath17  and @xmath18 .    because of its equal sensitivity to all active neutrinos , the neutral - current measurement can determine the total neutrino flux , hence resolving the solar neutrino problem , _ even if neutrinos oscillate_@xcite .",
    "sno is currently the only experiment that can simultaneously observe the _ disappearance _ of @xmath1  and the _ appearance _ of another active species .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : smoking_gun ] .",
    "another feature of the neutral - current interaction is its low kinematic threshold . by efficiently counting the free neutrons in the final state of the neutral - current reaction",
    ", the total active @xmath2b neutrino flux can be inferred for neutrinos with energy above the 2.2-mev kinematic threshold .",
    "recent results  @xcite from the measurements of the solar @xmath3b neutrino flux by the sno detector using the cc , nc and es reactions are presented in this paper .",
    "the results@xcite of a measurement of the day - night asymmetry of the neutrino event rates , which is predicted under certain neutrino oscillation scenarios , are also presented .",
    "finally , the physics implications of these observations will be discussed .",

    "the results that are presented in this paper are truly groundbreaking .",
    "the neutral - current measurement is the first direct measurement of the total active @xmath2b neutrino flux .",
    "the neutrino fluxes measured by this channel provide strong evidence for neutrino flavor transformation , thereby solving the long - standing solar neutrino problem .",
    "the significance of @xmath1  transforming into @xmath23 or @xmath24 is at 5.3@xmath25 level .",
    "this neutral - current measurement also verified the standard solar model prediction of the @xmath2b neutrino flux .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is also the first direct measurement of the day - night asymmetries in the @xmath1  flux and the total neutrino flux .",
    "when combining the day and night energy spectra from sno with results from other solar neutrino experiments in a global 2-@xmath26 flavor analysis of the msw oscillation parameters , the lma solution is strongly favored and the  dark side \" ( @xmath271 ) is excluded .    in the coming years",
    ", sno will continue to make significant contributions to solar neutrino physics by refining the neutral - current measurement and the day - night asymmetry with different experimental techniques .",
    "it will also attempt to look for other possible signatures of neutrino oscillation ( e.g. spectral distortion ) and other rare processes ( e.g. nucleon decays , anti-@xmath26 ) in its future physics program .",
