    "one of the major scientific objectives of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope before launch is to characterize the spectrum of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) over 7 decades of photon energies , i.e. , from 8  kev to over 100  gev , both during the prompt emission phase and the afterglow phase  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "determining where a grb spectrum ends at high energies has important implications on grb physics .",
    "the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) observations of grbs over the past few years have proved very fruitful , and results are summarized in the first lat grb catalog and references therein  @xcite .",
    "major results include the establishment of the temporally extended gev emission from many lat - detected grbs .",
    "the spectrum of the extended emission above 100  mev is usually characterized by a single power law . however , due to the steeply decreasing photon flux from grbs above 10 gev , the lat has by now only detected a handful of @xmath010  gev photons from grbs ; the most energetic of all observed photons from grbs is the @xmath133  gev photon emitted 82  s after the fermi s gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) trigger of grb  090902b  @xcite .",
    "an extra hard spectral component during the prompt phase has been detected in cases like grb  090902b and grb  090926a  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , yet unclear whether the single power - law spectrum extends above 10 gev or there is any extra spectral components or even cutoffs in the gev emission well after the prompt phase .",
    "this lack of information is mostly due to the limited photons statistics above a few gev , where a single power - law spectrum seems to adequately describe the @xmath0100  mev spectra observed so far .    the widely discussed scenario for this temporally extended gev emission is the afterglow synchrotron model , where electrons are accelerated by external forward shocks and produce gev photons via synchrotron radiation ( e.g. kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ; wang et al .",
    "this model works well for high - energy emission above 100 mev .",
    "however , since the synchrotron radiation has a maximum photon energy ( typically @xmath2 mev in the rest - frame of the shock ) , it is hard to explain the @xmath010 gev photons detected during the afterglow phase ( piran & nakar 2010 ; barniol duran & kumar 2011 ; sagi & nakar 2012 ; wang et al .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that these @xmath3 gev photons detected from some lat grbs could originate from the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission of the early afterglow if the circum - burst density is sufficiently large , or from external inverse compton processes in the presence of central x - ray emission  @xcite .",
    "the afterglow inverse compton scenario has been proposed for a while and has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the external inverse compton scenario ( e.g. scattering off x - ray flare photons ) has been supported by the simultaneous detections of x - ray flares ( by swift ) and gev emission ( by fermi lat ) in grb100728a @xcite .",
    "recently , based on similar theoretical arguments , @xcite suggested that inverse compton scattering plays a crucial role in giving rise to the @xmath010  gev photons from grb  130427a  that arrive @xmath0100  s after the grb onset . in this letter , we make use of the publicly available lat data to derive the basic characteristics of the gev emission from grb  130427a .",
    "we derive the time - resolved spectra during the afterglow phase and to study the presence of any inverse compton spectral component .",
    "grb  130427a  triggered several space instruments : swift / bat  @xcite , fermi gamma - ray telescope @xcite , konus - wind @xcite , spi - acs / integral  @xcite , and agile @xcite .",
    "three raptor full - sky persistent optical monitors also recorded the event  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the gbm trigger time , i.e. , 07:47:06.42 ut on april 27 , 2013 , as @xmath4 throughout this work  @xcite .",
    "the burst duration , @xmath5 , is about 138s as measured by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard fermi in the energy range 50300  kev .",
    "most notably , the energy fluence as measured in the prompt emission phase is around 2@xmath610@xmath7  erg  @xmath8 , putting grb  130427a  as the grb with the highest fluence in the mission life of both fermi / gbm and konus - wind @xcite , as well as the burst having the highest fluence measured by the lat during the prompt phase .",
    "_ swift _ s x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began data - taking of the burst at @xmath9s and found the x - ray afterglow at the position r.a .",

    "@xmath11  ( j2000 ) , with an error circle of radius  @xmath12  ( 90% confidence level ; * ? ? ?",
    "this position is used in the analyses presented in this letter .",
    "the flux faded steeply initially as a power law with an index of @xmath13 and , after a break at @xmath14s , as @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the redshift of the burst was found to be @xmath16  @xcite . at this distance ,",
    "its isotropic energy @xmath17 is @xmath18 erg  @xcite , making it the most energetic grb yet detected at @xmath19 .",
    "the angle of the grb position is about 47@xmath20 from the lat boresight when gbm was triggered and the grb remains within the lat field - of - view ( fov ) until around @xmath21s  @xcite .",
    "the gev emission can be detected up to about one day after the burst , although the grb position had been occulted by the earth several times over such period  @xcite .",
    "the lat emission from grb  130427a  lasts well beyond the prompt emission period until about one day after the grb onset .",
    "this is the longest gev afterglow emission ever recorded for a grb .",
    "furthermore , the gev photons that grb  130427a  emits contain some of the most energetic @xmath22-rays  from grbs .",
    "a total of twelve @xmath010  gev photons were recorded in the first 700  s after the burst onset , including a 95.3  gev photons arriving at @xmath23s . at @xmath16 ,",
    "this photon has an intrinsic photon energy ( energy as measured at the source frame ) of 128  gev , the highest ever known from a grb .",
    "such a long duration and high photon energy may simply due to the proximity of grb  130427a , as compared to other bright lat grbs , since the observed energy of a photon is the intrinsic photon energy divided by a factor of @xmath24 , and the late gev afterglow of a far - away grb  130427a - like could be below the sensitivity level of the lat .",
    "the photon - photon attenuation of multi - gev photons by the extragalactic background light would only strengthen this distance - only argument .",
    "on the other hand , the unique physical conditions in the jet and/or the environment of grb  130427a  might still play a role in giving rise to the large number of @xmath010  gev photons and the very high photon energy that they possess .",
    "grb spectra are expected to change over time , so we performed time - resolved spectral analysis of the lat data .",
    "the fermi science tools v9r27p1 package was used to reduce and analyze the data between 100  mev and 100  gev . using",
    "the `` p7transient''-class data would increase the effective collection area , and thus the photon statistics , by @xmath150100% above 100  mev , compared to the event class `` p7source_v6 ''  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since our focus is in the extended gev emission that lasts for about one day , for simplicity we made use of the events classified as `` p7source '' for all analyses .",
    "the instrument response functions `` p7source_v6 '' were used . to reduce the contamination from earth albedo @xmath22-rays , we excluded events with zenith angles greater than 100@xmath20 .",
    "we then performed unbinned maximum - likelihood analyzes ( _ gtlike _ ) of a 20@xmath25-roi centered at the swift / xrt position to characterize the spectra of the @xmath0100  mev @xmath22-rays  from the grb onset to the afterglow phase . the galactic diffuse emission ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ) and the isotropic diffuse component ( iso_p7v6source.txt ) , as well as sources in the second fermi catalog",
    "were included in the background model . however , an isotropic component turns out to be enough to model the background photons in the time bins before @xmath26s , due to the dominance of the grb emission over other sources in the roi during these short - duration intervals .",
    "firstly , we performed analysis for the whole energy range ( i.e. , 100  mev to 100  gev ) , assuming a single power law spectrum for the lat photons from the grb .",
    "four time intervals from the prompt to afterglow phases were used .",
    "we found that the photon indices , @xmath27 for all time bins ( see table  [ lat_spec ] ) .",
    "however , it is expected that gev spectra might change over time in the @xmath11-day period .",
    "we therefore divided the lat energy range into five energy bins , and performed likelihood analyzes for each bin , letting the photon index of the grb to be free in each energy bin .",
    "we plot the flux given by the analysis of each bin in fig .",
    "[ five_band_spec ] .",
    "it is apparent that the 100  mev to 100  gev spectra are indeed not well described by single power laws in some time intervals .",
    "we therefore employed the broken power - law model ( bpl ) .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ lat_spec ] .",
    "it was found that the bpl fits the data better than a single pl at a significance level of @xmath12.52.9 for the latter two time intervals ( i.e. , after 138  s ) , consistent with a visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ five_band_spec ] . fitting the data from 138s to 80ks with a bpl",
    "gives an improvement over a pl at a significance level of 3.5 .",
    "we hence conclude that a soft ( @xmath28 ) , low - energy spectral component below 1  gev co - exists with a hard ( @xmath29 ) component at energies higher than a few gev after @xmath30  s .",
    "it is possible that the high - energy hard component already exists at the latter phase of the prompt emission , but our analysis found that a single power law fits the data as good as a broken power law in the second time interval , i.e. , 20138  s. an attempt to fit the data using the smooth broken power law , which contain an additional free parameter , did not provide constraining spectral fits .",
