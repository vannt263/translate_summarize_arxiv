    "the study of dynamics of opinion formation is nowadays a hot topic in the statistical physics of complex systems , with a considerable amount of papers published in the last years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even simple models can exhibit an interesting collective behavior that emerges from the microscopic interaction among indivuals or agents in a given social network .",
    "usually those models exhibit nonequilibrium phase transition and rich critical phenomena , which justifies the interest of physicists in the study of opinion dynamics @xcite .",
    "the majority - vote model have been extensively studied in the last 20 years @xcite . in the standard model , each site of a square lattice",
    "has an ising - spin variable whose state @xmath3 may be associated with the opinion of an individual in a given social community .",
    "the time evolution of the model is governed by an inflow dynamics , where the center spin is influenced by its nearest neighbors : an individual located at the central site adopts the minority sign of the spins in its neighborhood with probability @xmath0 and the majority sign with probability @xmath4 .",
    "numerical results indicate that the model undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition at a critical noise @xmath5 , and the critical exponents were found to be the same as those of the equilibrium 2d ising model , i.e. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the transition separates an ordered phase , where one of the opinions dominates the population , from a disordered one , where the two opinions coexist in equal proportions .",
    "after that , many extensions of the original model were proposed .",
    "for example , we can highlight the interaction between two different classes of agents @xcite , spins with three - state variables @xcite , noise distributed according to a bimodal distribution @xcite , diffusion @xcite and heterogeneous agents @xcite .",
    "the influence of topology was also considered , with studies on random @xcite , hypercubic @xcite and hyperbolic @xcite lattices , random graphs @xcite , small - world @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite , among others .",
    "some new universality classes were found for different topologies @xcite , but in some of the above - mentioned modifications the critical exponents are ising - like , i.e , they are the same as those of the original majority - vote model @xcite .",
    "the consideration of the usual noise @xmath0 in the majority - vote model produces an effect similar to the introduction of the _ contrarians _ in the population , individuals that adopt the choice opposite to the prevailing choice of the others , whatever this choice is @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is the probability of an agent assume the opposite opinion shared by the local majority .",
    "the contrarian effect is called _ anticonformism _ in the language of social sciences , and it is one kind of nonconformism @xcite .",
    "another kind of nonconformist is _ independence _",
    ", where the agent also take cognizance of the group norm , but he / she decides to take one of the possible opinions ( @xmath3 in the case of the majority - vote model ) independently of the majority or the minority opinion in the group @xcite .",
    "effects of independence on phase transitions in opinion models were considered recently @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the two mentioned kinds of nonconformity , anticonformity and independence .",
    "the last is introduced in the system as a probability @xmath9 , in a way that a given agent chooses one of the two possible opinions with equal probability ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , the population evolves under the presence of two types of noises , represented by the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "we consider agents placed on fully - connected networks and on square lattices , and our interest is to study the effects of the two kinds of stochastic driving in the phase transitions of the model .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic rules that define the model , and the analytical and numerical results are discussed in two distinct subsections , considering the mean - field approximation and the square lattice .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 3 .",
    "our model is based on the majority - vote model @xcite .",
    "every site of a given lattice with @xmath11 sites is occupied by an agent , and to each site @xmath12 we assign a random opinion @xmath13 with equal probability @xmath10 , corresponding to the two possible opinions in a certain subject . in the original model @xcite , a randomly chosen individual follows the opinion of the minority of its @xmath14 nearest neighbors with probability @xmath0 and adopts the majority sign of the spins in its neighborhood with probability @xmath4 . in this work we will consider the effects of the independent behavior , where a randomly chosen individual acts independently of their neighbors with probability @xmath9 . in this case ,",
    "he / she chooses one of the two possible opinions @xmath3 with equal probability @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , with the complementary probability @xmath15 we apply the original rule of the majority - vote model . summarizing , considering the effects of the two noises @xmath0 and @xmath9 , a given spin @xmath16",
    "is flipped with probability @xmath17 + \\frac{p}{2 } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 if @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the summation is over the nearest neighbors . observe that in the absence of the independent behavior ( @xmath22 ) we recover the standard flip probability of the majority - vote model @xcite .",
    "thus , our model presents two distinct types of stochastic driving , governed by the two noises @xmath0 and @xmath9 . in the language of social sciences",
    ", we are considering two kinds of nonconformity , namely anticonformity ( contrarian effect , parameter @xmath0 ) and independence ( parameter @xmath9 ) .",
    "we are interested in the critical behavior of the model .",
    "as the parameter @xmath9 is the novelty of the model , we will consider the quantities of interest as functions of @xmath9 , for typical values of @xmath0 .",

    "it means that if at least a fraction @xmath95 of the population takes independent decisions , there is no final decision in the debate , independent of the presence of contrarians .",
    "otherwise , there can be a majority opinion dominating the population , which means a decision on the debate . in the mean - field approximation of the model",
