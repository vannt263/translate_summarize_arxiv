    "in the current era of precision cosmology , the foundations of the so - called standard model of cosmology are constantly being challenged by observations of ever - increasing accuracy and precision .",
    "this standard model describes the universe as homogeneous and isotropic on large length scales , whose energy content consists presently of approximately 75% dark energy which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe , and 25% nonrelativistic matter .",
    "these simple deductions are the culmination of many different types of observations , and the timescales on which the numbers evolve substantially are of order the age of the universe .    in the last years , however , a new way of inferring and testing the global properties of the universe on a much shorter timescale has emerged : real - time cosmology ( rtc )  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to take advantage of the high level of precision offered by current measurements of angular positions and redshifts for objects such as quasars in the universe .",
    "because the movement of such objects is cosmology - dependent , tracking the same objects over an extended period of time , e.g. , ten years , may help shed light on the underlying cosmology  @xcite .    the main focus of earlier works on rtc has been to distinguish between a completely isotropic universe and a universe wherein some degree of large - scale anisotropy exists .",
    "examples of anisotropic universes include lematre  tolman  bondi ( ltb ) void models  @xcite , meatball universes  @xcite , and bianchi universes  @xcite .",
    "universes in which the observer resides in a massive overdensity such as the hypothetical great attractor also belong to this group of models  @xcite .",
    "what has not be established so far , however , is if rtc could differentiate these anisotropic models from one another .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the potential of rtc further , and propose a new test based on multipole alignment that may help distinguish between different classes of large - scale anisotropic universes .",
    "the basic premise is that the movements of the observed objects can be encoded in a set of `` displacement maps '' , and the maps analysed using a multipole expansion .",
    "because each class of anisotropic models predicts a unique set of multipoles  especially in terms of their alignments  various classes of models can be differentiated from one another on this basis .",
    "we illustrate the methodology in the following using two toy anisotropic models .",
    "the first is a radially expanding spherically symmetric ltb void model , which has been investigated extensively in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second is a universe in which the observer lives inside a large region with a net rotation , while outside this region the net rotation is zero .",
    "substantial global rotation is not generally expected in standard cosmologies , since any rotation will be heavily diluted in the process of cosmological inflation  @xcite .",
    "however , extended regions of space such as voids or giant clusters of galaxies can possess some degree of angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "large - scale rotation models and models with global rotation in general have been investigated to some extent in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : ii ] , we present the formalism for the construction of the displacement maps and their associated spherical harmonic moments and multipole vectors .",
    "the formalism is then applied to ltb and rotating universes in section  [ sec : examples ] , in order to establish their model signatures . in section",
    "[ sec : v ] , we describe the method of our numerical simulations , the results of which we discuss in  [ sec : forecast ] for a selection of models based on the expected performance of the gaia quasar survey  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : vi ] contains our conclusions .",
    "our numerical code is available for download at http://web.physik.rwth-aachen.de/download/valkenburg/rotation/ , and can be used for any model of object displacement .",
    "we begin with the expression for the angular separation between two objects as measured by an observer , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the positions of the two objects with respect to some coordinate system , @xmath4 the location of the observer , and @xmath5 .",
    "if each object ( including the observer ) moves to a different coordinate point in space , i.e. , @xmath6 , then the new angular separation @xmath7 between the objects as seen by the observer will be given by @xmath8 if the displacements are small , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then to first order in the small parameter @xmath11 , @xmath12 and consequently , @xmath13 \\equiv     \\cos \\gamma_{12 } - \\cos \\gamma_{12 } ' \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{35 mm } \\simeq    ( \\vec{q}_1 \\cdot \\hat{n}_1 + \\vec{q}_2 \\cdot \\hat{n}_2 ) ( \\hat{n}_1 \\cdot \\hat{n}_2 ) - \\vec{q}_1 \\cdot \\hat{n}_2 - \\vec{q}_2 \\cdot \\hat{n}_1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gives the change in the angular separation between the two objects .",
    "since a typical survey will observe several hundred thousand objects or more , we wish to condense the information in @xmath14 $ ] for each pair of objects into some sort of average quantity . to this end",
    "we parameterise @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and similarly for @xmath18 .",
    "then , for each set of @xmath19 , we define @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the number density distribution of observed objects ( assumed here to depend only on @xmath23 ) , normalised such that @xmath24 .",
    "physically , this means that for each set of @xmath19 , we first find the average @xmath25 value for each object found at these coordinates relative to all other objects in the sky , and then sum along the line - of - sight all objects at @xmath19 . the procedure results in a 2-dimensional map on the surface of a sphere , which can be further subjected to a decomposition @xmath26 where @xmath27 , in terms of the spherical harmonic functions @xmath28 .",
    "it is simple to generalise this `` map - making '' procedure also to higher moments of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , the second moment is @xmath29 which has the spherical harmonic decomposition @xmath30 and @xmath31 gives the corresponding multipole moments .",
    "we defer the evaluation of @xmath32 and the associated spherical harmonic multipole moments for specific cosmological models to section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "suffice it to say here , however , that it is the _ alignment _ of the multipoles of @xmath33 and @xmath34 that allows us to distinguish between radial expansion and rotation models .    to quantify the multipole alignments in a basis - independent fashion",
    ", we note that the @xmath35th multipole @xmath36 can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath37 , @xmath38 is an @xmath35-dependent constant , and @xmath39 a @xmath40th degree polynomial of @xmath41 .",
    "importantly , @xmath42 are a set of cartesian ( headless ) vectors called the multipole vectors , which quantify the orientation of the multipole @xmath36 in lieu of the spherical harmonic moments . as an example , the dipole @xmath43 can be translated into one single cartesian vector @xmath44 , with components @xmath45 higher multipoles vectors generally can not be related to the spherical harmonic moments in such a straightforward manner . however , as a guide , the real part of the spherical harmonic @xmath46 is spanned by @xmath47 vectors separated by an angle @xmath48 in the @xmath49-plane , and @xmath50 vectors pointing in the @xmath51-direction.th multipole vectors consists of first writing out the spherical harmonics @xmath52 in cartesian coordinates , and evaluating the sum @xmath53 in equation  ( [ eq : multipolevectors ] ) .",
    "this sum is then massaged into the form @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are polynomials of @xmath41 of degree @xmath35 and @xmath40 respectively , and @xmath57 . in the final step",
    "we factorise @xmath58 into @xmath35 linear polynomials . the resulting @xmath59th linear polynomial ( @xmath60 )",
    "is then of the form @xmath61 , where the coefficients correspond to the cartesian components of the @xmath59th vector @xmath42 up to a constant normalisation factor . ]",
    "once the multipole vectors have been determined , the question of alignment between any two multipoles can be addressed in terms of inner products of their corresponding multipole ( unit ) vectors . in this work",
    ", we shall be concerned mainly with the multipole vectors of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , denoted @xmath62 respectively . where numerical evaluation of these vectors is required",
    ", it is performed using the module of  @xcite ( although we have also tested it against the module published in  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we explore the differences between radial expansion and rotation models in terms of the alignment of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 multipoles .",
    "generic predictions are summarised in section  [ sec : summary ] , particularly table  [ tab : alignmentpredictions ] .",
    "lematre  tolman  bondi void models fall into this category . here",
    ", radial expansion displaces an object according to the displacement vector @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the radial expansion rate which we assume to depend only on the distance @xmath65 to the origin , and @xmath66 is the time elapsed .",
    "it follows that @xmath67   \\cdot \\vec{s}_o + \\frac { \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_o}{r_2 } \\left [ ( \\hat{n}_1 \\cdot \\hat{n}_2 ) \\hat{n}_2 -   \\hat{n}_1 \\right ] \\cdot \\vec{s}_o,\\ ] ] where we have used the shorthand notation @xmath68 and @xmath69 . without loss of generality we may choose the observer to be sitting on the @xmath51-axis ,",
    "so that @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .    in order to evaluate analytically the moments  ( [ eq : fff ] ) and  ( [ eq : fffsquared ] ) , we must first rewrite the expansion rate @xmath72 as a function of the distances @xmath73 and the angles @xmath74 measured by the observer . without specifying an exact form for @xmath72 ,",
    "this is in general a non - trivial problem because of the nonlinear dependence of @xmath75 on the said parameters , and some form of expansion is usually necessary .",
    "given the symmetry of our set - up , we find it convenient to expand @xmath72 in terms of the legendre series , @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is a legendre polynomial of degree @xmath79 .",
    "the advantage of the legendre decomposition over , e.g. , a taylor expansion in @xmath80 is that the former can be used to explore both the @xmath81 ( observer at a small distance from the origin ) and the @xmath82 ( observer at a large distance from the origin ) limits , wherein the @xmath83 legendre moments of @xmath72 characterise the anisotropic expansion rate _ seen by the observer _ as a result of their being removed from the origin . as we shall see below , in some cases ,",
    "this formulation even admits exact solutions valid for all @xmath73 and @xmath84 values .    adopting the expansion  ( [ eq : legendre ] )",
    ", we find for the first moment @xmath85 an exact solution @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes averaging as per equation  ( [ eq : fff])in this particular instance , this means averaging along the line - of - sight , weighted by the number density of observed objects  and we have omitted writing out the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath84 .",
    "clearly , the dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath90 indicates that @xmath91 is the only nonvanishing spherical harmonic moment .",
    "this can be expressed equivalently in terms of multipole vectors as @xmath92 corresponding to a dipole that lies on the @xmath51-axis and connects to the origin .",
    "an exact solution is not available for the second moment @xmath93 .",
    "however , decomposing @xmath93 as per equation  ( [ eq : sphericalf2 ] ) , symmetry arguments tell us that the only nonvanishing @xmath94 entries are those with @xmath95 .",
    "an equivalent statement is that all multipole vectors are aligned with the @xmath51-axis , i.e. , @xmath96 for @xmath97 , this in turn leads to a generic prediction for radial expansion models : exact alignment between the @xmath98 dipole and all @xmath93 multipoles , i.e. , @xmath99 where @xmath97 , can be expected , which makes sense physically , given the only source of anisotropy in the model is the fact that the observer is removed from the origin in the @xmath51-direction .    for the aficionado ,",
    "approximate solutions for @xmath94 can be written down in the small ( @xmath81 ) and the large ( @xmath82 ) distance limits by noting that , for expansion rates described by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , the legendre coefficients @xmath102 behave roughly as @xmath103 if @xmath81 , and @xmath104 if @xmath82 .",

    ", we see that although the dipole lies on the @xmath49-plane , its precise orientation is strongly dependent on the angular velocity model as well as on the precise location of the observer .",
    "furthermore , unlike the dipole of @xmath160 which can be understood to indicate the direction of the observer s motion around the rotation axis , the orientation of @xmath161 s dipole has no clear physical interpretation ; for instance , it does not in general point back to the origin .",
    "importantly , however , the dipoles of @xmath160 and @xmath161 are _ always _ orthogonal to each other in rotation models such that @xmath162 this is in contrast with the case of radial expansion , where the two dipoles are always exactly aligned ( see equation  ( [ eq : ltbprediction ] ) ) .",
    "the quadrupole of @xmath161 likewise exhibits different limiting behaviours . in the small distance @xmath163 limit ,",
    "the leading order @xmath164 moments are simply those given in equation  ( [ eq : rotdecomposition ] ) ( for an observer sitting at the origin ) , with @xmath165 ^ 2 \\rangle , \\ ] ] indicating that both quadrupole vectors are aligned with the rotation axis as per equation  ( [ eq : rotf2quadrupole ] ) .",
    "this result remains true even as the observer moves further away from the origin ( @xmath166 ) , as long as he / she stays close to the rotation axis , i.e. , @xmath167 .",
    "however , if the observer is significantly removed from the rotation axis ( @xmath168 or @xmath169 ) , then the large distance @xmath170 limit sees @xmath108 dominating over @xmath171 , with @xmath172 ^ 2}{r^2 } \\right \\rangle , \\ ] ] resulting in quadrupole vectors @xmath173 that are now aligned with the @xmath51-axis .",
    "this `` flipping '' of the quadrupole alignment is clearly sourced by the increasing importance of the observer s own motion in the @xmath117-plane : when close to the origin , the dominant effect seen by the observer is the difference between the rotation rates of the various objects along the rotation axis ( and hence the dependence on @xmath174 in equation  ( [ eq : ab ] ) ) .",
    "when far away from the origin , however , the observer perceives this difference less than he / she would perceive the difference between their own motion in the @xmath51-direction and the motion of these objects ( and hence the dependence on @xmath175 in equation  ( [ eq : far ] ) ) . where the flipping occurs is model - dependent .",
    "we therefore argue that the quadrupole of @xmath161 is perhaps not very useful as a diagnostic of rotation models .",
    "figure  [ fig : inpvsr ] illustrates this flipping by way of the inner product of @xmath176 for the @xmath177-rotation model ( in which @xmath178 ; see section  [ sec : anismodels ] for details ) .",

    "the orientation of the @xmath179 quadrupole makes a rapid transition from being orthogonal to being parallel to the @xmath181 dipole as the observer moves away from the origin . ]",
    "the octopole of @xmath161 has in general @xmath182 , and displays the same `` flipping '' feature as the quadrupole . on the one hand , for small displacements ( @xmath163 ) or an on - axis observer ( @xmath183 ) ,",

    "thus , we have a model - independent signature : at least one vector of the octopole of @xmath34 satisfies the orthogonality condition @xmath189 this is in contrast with the predictions for radial expansion models  ( [ eq : ltbprediction ] ) , where all @xmath34 multipole vectors are exactly aligned with the @xmath89 dipole .",

    "importantly , by observing the alignment or orthogonality of the dipoles of @xmath89 and @xmath34 , we should in principle be able to distinguish decisively between these two classes of anisotropic models .",
    "further distinctions can be gleaned from the octopole vectors of @xmath34 , which again show opposite behaviours for radially expanding and rotating universes .",
    ".generic predictions for various inner products in ltb and rotation models . in the latter case",
    "the observer is assumed to be both off - axis and off - centre .",
    "the notation @xmath191 denotes the inner product can change from @xmath192 to @xmath113 when going from small to large displacements from the centre , while `` md '' indicates a model - dependent number between 0  and  1 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in contrast , all rotation models considered in this work impose significantly less constraints on the observer location .",
    "take for example the case of @xmath177-rotation .",
    "the relatively flat curves indicate that the detectability of both observables a and b are practically unaffected by the observer position ( as long as the observer is inside the rotation region ) , simply because the rotation velocities in this model are independent of an object s distance from the origin .",
    "this also implies that our results from section  [ sec : consistent ] are not unique to the chosen observer position of @xmath193  mpc from the origin , but apply to any observer position within the rotating region ( @xmath194  gpc ) .",
    "detectability is only limited by the survey resolution .    for the solid rotation model , the rotation speed increases with distance from the origin up to @xmath195  gpc , beyond which it drops to zero .",
    "this feature of the model is best exemplified by the `` dip '' in the 1-@xmath0as - detectability curve in figure  [ fig : forreferee ] for observable b at @xmath196  mpc , which , unsurprisingly , is also the region in which the observer s own peculiar velocity is strongly at odds with observational constraints from the cmb dipole .",
    "thus , at a survey resolution of 1  @xmath0as , to maximise detectability and simultaneously maintain observational consistency the observer must sit at a distance less than but as close as possible to @xmath197  mpc from the origin .",
    "this also sets the limit of applicability of our results in section  [ sec : consistent ] for the solid rotation model at the said resolution .",
    "the limitation does not apply at a finer survey resolution of  0.01  @xmath0as , however ; as shown in figure  [ fig : forreferee ] , at 0.01  @xmath0as all observer positions at less than @xmath198  mpc from the origin yield detectable signals in both observables  a and  b.",
    "lastly , in the case of @xmath199-rotation , the observer must sit beyond @xmath200  mpc from the origin in order to comply with cmb constraints .",
    "however , at a survey resolution of 1  @xmath0as figure  [ fig : forreferee ] shows that detectability can only be assured for observable b if the observer does not stray too far beyond @xmath201  mpc . improving the survey resolution to 0.01",
    "@xmath0as allows for a positive detection even if the observer should sit as far as 2  gpc from the origin .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new method to distinguish between isotropic cosmological models and models with large - scale anisotropies .",

    "the ltb void model was a popular alternative to @xmath202cdm as it provided a viable explanation for the apparent acceleration of the universal expansion without invoking dark energy , albeit at the cost of forgoing the copernican principle .",
    "the rotation models , on the other hand , have been introduced in part as dummy alternatives in order to test if different classes of anisotropic cosmological models could be differentiated from one another using our method .",
    "however , we note that while cosmological models with substantial global rotation are in general inconsistent with inflationary cosmologies ( because of dilution during inflation ) , a small degree of rotational motion could conceivably have been generated by nonlinear effects in the early universe and survived to the present time ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a discussion of vorticity evolution ) . alternatively and perhaps more realistically , extended regions of space possessing a finite angular momentum could have arisen from nonlinear structure formation at late times .",
    "if we happened to be living in such a region , an apparent rotation of the local celestial objects is a possible manifestation of this eventuality .",
    "our analysis shows that , with just ten years of patience , observations of 500.000 quasars with a next - generation gaia - like satellite at an angular resolution of 1  @xmath0as can effectively differentiate between the @xmath202cdm and anisotropic universes , be they ltb or rotation models .",
    "the required resolution is roughly a factor of ten better than gaia s nominal specification . to distinguish between different classes of anisotropic models",
    "is however a more demanding task : at a survey resolution of 1  @xmath0as , we find that a waiting time of at least 100 years is required in order for the relevant signatures to become detectable . furthermore",
    ", in some cases the observer location may require some degree of fine - tuning in order to maximise the signal and at the same time comply with existing cosmological bounds on the observer s peculiar velocity .",
    "we caution at this point that we have assumed the sdss quasar selection function to be representative for gaia .",
    "this was a choice of convenience ; a wildly different selection function could conceivably change the outcome .    notwithstanding the somewhat discouraging conclusions",
    ", our analysis clearly demonstrates that the two classes of anisotropic universes under consideration give rise to very different signals in the real - time cosmological tests proposed in this work , signals whose detectability increases with both the observational time gap and the survey resolution . a possible next step to",
    "further this analysis is to include an _ additional _ peculiar velocity component for the observer , one that mimics , e.g. , the peculiar motion of the solar system within the local group , and in a direction uncorrelated with the coherent rotation / expansion motion of the anisotropic model . likewise , relativistic effects not considered in this work such as rotation - induced frame - dragging which alters the space - time metric and subsequently the null geodesics , or relativistic aberration arising from the motion of the emitting quasars relative to the observer may constitute additional sources of uncertainties .",
    "a detailed investigation is required to discern their full impact on our conclusions .",
    "furthermore , from a statistical point of view , our analysis so far has focussed on identifying the survey parameters at which the observation of several pre - defined inner products individually transits from noise domination to signal domination .",
    "a logical extension to this would be to consider the _ combined _ probability of the different inner products , which should serve to enhance information extraction from the data .",
    "other means to abstract a stronger signal from the noise may also be possible .    in the end ,",
    "survey resolution is the key . and",
    "should observations significantly more well - resolved than gaia become available in the future , telling apart different cosmological models  isotropic as well as anisotropic  within a reasonable timespan may not be an entirely impossible task .",
