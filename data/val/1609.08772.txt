    "we did not find any systematic bias in the average of the @xmath42 mean fluxes for input fluxes ranging from 0.005 mjy to 0.2 mjy .",
    "we present stacked alma 1.1 mm images at the candels 3.6 @xmath0 m sources in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "if we simply stack all sources , we do not reach a @xmath43 detection .",
    "this indicates that most of the faint 3.6 @xmath0 m sources do not exhibit strong dust emission . on the other hand , once we split the samples according to their 3.6 @xmath0 m magnitudes and stack , we see a clear trend that brighter nir sources are also brighter 1.1 mm sources , on average .",
    "this is generally true in all the nir bands from f125w to 4.5 @xmath0 m , and the tendency is stronger in the two irac bands .",
    "we will describe this in more details in the next subsection . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it can also be seen that the apparent 1.1 mm positions do not always exactly match the nir positions ( circles in the figure )",
    ". however , the offsets are all smaller than our @xmath44 alma beam in the top four @xmath45 bins .",
    "this can be explained with the relatively low s / n . if we stack all sources with @xmath46 ( lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which gives the maximum s / n , the offset disappears .",

    "the stacked 344 ghz for 85 @xmath49 and @xmath50 mjy sources is @xmath51 mjy .",
    "this is fully consistent with ours once our 1.1 mm stacked flux is scaled by @xmath52 @xcite , given that in this magnitude range the typical @xmath53 color is @xmath54 .",
    "this is also comparable to the faintest stacked 350 ghz flux reached in @xcite .",
    "we measured the size of detected 1.1 mm emission in the stacked images from the @xmath36 bin ( @xmath55 ) by fitting a 2d gaussian distribution .",
    "the fitted gaussian has a fwhm of @xmath56 , slightly larger than the @xmath19 synthesized beam .",
    "this suggests small source sizes , probably only marginally resolved by the alma beam .",
    "this is consistent with higher angular resolution alma studies of brighter sources ( @xcite ) and also the stacking analyses in d16 .",
    "however , given the low s / n and the apparent offsets between the nir positions and the stacked 1.1 mm positions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we do not think we can place a meaningful constraint on the source size .",
    "we only use this result to guide our selection of flux aperture size in our subsequent analyses .",
    "we move on to measure 1.1 mm fluxes at the positions of the candels sources and stack the fluxes .",
    "based on the above - measured source size , we adopted a relatively small flux aperture , @xmath57 ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the aperture correction is derived based on the dirty beam assuming unresolved sources .",
    "such a small aperture gives higher s / n while still enclosing most of the fluxes from unresolved and slightly resolved objects .",
    "it does not require different aperture corrections for cleaned and uncleaned sources , since the clean and dirty beams only become substantially different at distances greater than a fwhm .",
    "the major results are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present 1.1 mm fluxes of individual galaxies and stacked 1.1 mm fluxes vs.  magnitudes at @xmath31 , @xmath58 , @xmath25 , and 3.6 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "when the 1.1 mm fluxes are ordered according to the @xmath31-band magnitudes , we can not obtain detections with stacking analyses .",
    "some of the brighter 1.1 mm sources are even not detected at @xmath31 and therefore not included in the @xmath31-band stacking analyses .",
    "this shows that the unobscured star formation ( traced by rest - frame uv ) does not strongly correlate with obscured star formation ( traced by dust emission at 1.1 mm ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as we move to longer wavebands , there is a tendency that objects more luminous in the rest - frame nir are brighter 1.1 mm sources .",
    "this trend is the strongest at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "this is consistent with the results in fig .",
    "the strong correlation between 3.6 @xmath0 m magnitudes and stacked 1.1 mm fluxes can be explain by a correlation between stellar mass and obscured star formation . on the other hand",
    ", ongoing star formation can also boost the rest - frame nir luminosity of galaxies and lead to a correlation between 3.6 @xmath0 m and 1.1 mm .",
    "however , this effect should be even stronger in the optical bands ( @xmath31 and @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) as young stellar populations are blue , and this is not observed .",
    "stronger dust extinction in the bright end may hinder this effect in the optical , but the lack of correlation between 3.6 @xmath0 m magnitudes and galaxy colors in the optical ( which should be more strongly affected by extinction ) in our samples does not support this scenario . therefore , a correlation between stellar mass and star formation is a more plausible and natural explanation for the correlation between 3.6 @xmath0 m and 1.1 mm .",
    "this is consistent with the recent results in d16 .",
    "the above observed correlation between @xmath59 and stacked 1.1 mm flux is not universal and is probably only applicable to faint mm / submm sources , on average .",
    "at least two of the @xmath39 detections ( two brightest open diamonds in fig .",

    "the bright end of the counts in h16 is supplemented by single - dish counts and not entirely based on the sxdf - alma data",
    ". the h16 counts fitted with a schechter function integrated to 0.2 mjy yield an ebl contribution of 9.2 jy deg@xmath10 , which is represented by the thick blue curve in fig .  [ fig8 ] .",
    "after removing sources already accounted for in h16 , our stacked ebl contribution from nir sources without alma detections is 4.9 jy deg@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the combined ebl contribution from bright and faint sources is 14.1 jy deg@xmath10 .",
    "this is the lower end of the solid box in fig .",
    "this is comparable with the result in d16 , who also employ stacking analyses to supplement the directly detected fluxes .    the solid box in fig .  [ fig8",
    "] represents the range of resolved ebl probed by our stacking of faint objects , plus two different treatments of bright objects ( total detected flux in our field or adopting the wide - field bright - end counts ) .",
    "it is broadly consistent with that in f16 , who conducted the most thorough search by far for serendipitously detected faint continuum sources in deep alma 1.2 mm pointings in the archive .",
    "the counts in f16 at a @xmath135 mjy level lead to an ebl contribution of @xmath136 jy deg@xmath10 , while we recover up to 20.3 jy deg@xmath10 of ebl at 1.1 mm with stacking analyses on a faint population with @xmath137 mjy .",
    "the caveat here is that the f16 sample includes 1.2 mm sources that are optically faint , while our stacked signal comes from relatively bright nir sources ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this leads to our next discussion topic .      once we detect the majority of galaxies that give rise to the mm / submm ebl , we would like to ask what kinds of galaxies they are .",
    "additional to color and redshift distributions of these galaxies , of particular interest is the fraction of optically faint galaxies , i.e. , galaxies missed by deep optical / nir surveys .",
    "this tells us whether the star formation history constructed from optically selected galaxies is representative , or needs significant revision .",
    "we can gain insight on this by comparing our results with the results of f16 and with the _ cobe _ ebl values .",
    "the ebl resolved by our alma imaging and stacking analyses is still lower than the ebl measured by _",
    "cobe_. this suggests a considerable fraction ( anywhere between 0 and 44% ) of ebl arising from sources fainter than the candels detection limit .",
    "such extremely optically faint sources have been found in previous surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as our sxdf - alma survey ( sxdf - alma3 in @xcite ) .",
    "they are also hinted by the large number of alma detected sources without candels counterparts ( four out of eight for @xmath138 ) .",
    "the optically faint fraction ( 50% ) is similar to that in f16 ( 41% ) .",
    "because of the above , we hypothesize an optically faint population that is not picked up by our nir selection .",
    "we further assume that this population accounts for @xmath139 of the ebl from the faint end , based the optically faint fraction in f16 , for its larger sample size and higher alma sensitivity .",
    "this means a completeness correction of @xmath140 to our nir stacked ebl .",
    "once we do so , the solid box in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] becomes the dashed box , corresponding to 17.5 to 24.2 jy deg@xmath10 .",
    "this is comparable to the range allowed by the _ cobe _ measurements and",
    "the range probed / extrapolated by previous number counts .",
    "we therefore conclude that an optically faint fraction in the ballpark of 50%60% is consistent with existing data for both the bright and faint ends of the 1.1/1.2 mm population .",
    "if this is the case , then optical studies can only account for some 50% of high - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "the above studies demonstrate that with existing alma data , we just barely can scrape the surface of the issues raised by the resolved ebl and extremely dusty galaxies .",
    "future alma deep imaging will be able to put better constraints on the optically faint fraction as functions of mm / submm fluxes .",
    "ultimately , the accuracy in alma determinations of the ebl contribution from discrete sources may even exceed that in the _ cobe _ measurements .",
    "these will further transform our understanding of the dusty side of the galaxy evolution .",

    "<S> we present stacking analyses on our alma deep 1.1 mm imaging in the sxdf using 1.6 @xmath0 m and 3.6 @xmath0 m selected galaxies in the candels wfc3 catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a stacked flux of @xmath10.05 mjy , corresponding to @xmath2 and a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath3 yr@xmath4 at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that galaxies brighter in the rest - frame near - infrared tend to be also brighter at 1.1 mm , and galaxies fainter than @xmath6 do not produce detectable 1.1 mm emission . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a correlation between stellar mass and sfr , but outliers to this correlation are also observed , suggesting strongly boosted star formation or extremely large extinction . </S>",
    "<S> we also find tendencies that redder galaxies and galaxies at higher redshifts are brighter at 1.1 mm . </S>",
    "<S> our field contains @xmath7 h@xmath8 emitters and a bright single - dish source . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not find evidence of bias in our results caused by the bright source . by combining the fluxes of sources detected by alma and fluxes of faint sources detected with stacking , </S>",
    "<S> we recover a 1.1 mm surface brightness of up to @xmath9 jy deg@xmath10 , comparable to the extragalactic background light measured by _ cobe_. based on the fractions of optically faint sources in our and previous alma studies and the _ cobe _ measurements , we find that approximately half of the cosmic star formation may be obscured by dust and missed by deep optical surveys , much deeper and wider alma imaging is therefore needed to better constrain the obscured cosmic star formation history . </S>"
