    "quasars are not spherically symmetric systems .",
    "this is most apparent in the large - scale radio jets present in a minority of sources , but several inferred quasar structures , notably accretion disks and dusty torii , are also axisymmetric . in radio - loud quasars ,",
    "radio core dominance and spectral indices can be used to estimate system orientation ( orr & browne 1982 ; wills & brotherton 1995 ; van gorkom et al .",
    "there is as yet no reliable orientation indicator for radio - quiet quasars , which represent about 90% of all quasars ( but see boroson 2011 and sulentic et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "this axisymmetry is important to understand and account for when estimating some fundamental quasar parameters , such as black hole mass .",
    "many methods of determining quasar black hole mass ( e.g. , shen 2013 , peterson 2011 ) depend on the assumption of virial motion and use the doppler - broadended velocity width of an emission line  usually h@xmath1 at low redshift .",
    "the broad h@xmath1 emission - line width , often characterized by the full width at half maximum or fwhm , however , is correlated with orientation indicators in radio - loud quasars ( e.g. , wills & browne 1986 ) .",
    "this is suggestive that at least part of the broad - line region ( blr ) is flattened into a disk , with edge - on systems showing the broadest lines , a conclusion also supported by other lines of evidence ( gaskell 2009a ) .",
    "the velocity width of lines like h@xmath1 are apparently related to both black hole mass and system orientation .",
    "runnoe et al .",
    "( 2013 ) compared black hole masses computed using single - epoch ( se ) scaling relationships ( e.g. , vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) for both h@xmath1 and c iv @xmath31549 , the latter lacking strong fwhm changes with orientation ( but see runnoe et al .",
    "2014 for a discussion of some subtle profile changes ) .",
    "they found that the difference in the two black hole mass estimates significantly correlated with radio - based orientation parameters and determined correction terms for the h@xmath1-based formula .",
    "the same orientation effects affecting h@xmath1 also appear to be present in radio - quiet quasars ( shen & ho 2014 ) .",
    "it would be valuable to be able to provide an estimation of orientation for all quasars , not just radio - loud objects , to better determine how quasar properties change with viewing angle .",
    "another method exists for estimating black hole mass in quasars , via the correlation with stellar velocity dispersion @xmath2 ( e.g. , gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "the so - called m-@xmath2 relation , present in both active and quiescent galaxies , may represent an important clue to galaxy evolution . in the majority of quasars",
    ", the continuum dilutes the stellar absorption features to the point of non - detection , making @xmath2 difficult to determine directly .",

    "( 2003 ) pioneered using the fwhm of [ o iii ] @xmath35007 ( divided by 2.35 under the assumption of a gaussian profile ) as a proxy for @xmath2 in luminous quasars .",
    "others have since verified that fwhm [ o iii ] @xmath35007 does correlate , albeit with significant scatter , with @xmath2 ( boroson 2003 ; gaskell 2009b ) , although the [ o iii ] profile is not generally gaussian and the relationship is not so simple . brotherton ( 1996 ) found no relationship between fwhm [ o iii ] @xmath35007 and radio - based orientation indicators , although @xmath2 measurements may depend on the orientation to the line of sight of host galaxies disks ( e.g. , woo et al . 2015 ) .",
    "other investigations by salviander et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and salviander & shields ( 2013 ) used an h@xmath1-based scaling relationships to determine the quasar black hole mass , and fwhm [ o iii]/2.35 as a proxy for @xmath2 , in order to study the m-@xmath2 relation using large samples of spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "notably , while they found m/@xmath2 significantly correlated with redshift , they accounted for most of the effect as the result of a variety of selection biases and argued that m@xmath4-@xmath2 did not strongly evolve .",
    "they did not identify differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "we propose that much of their scatter in m@xmath5-@xmath2 arises from the orientation bias in fwhm h@xmath1 , and that it may be possible to use scatter in the m@xmath5-@xmath2 relation computed in this way as an orientation indicator .    in the rest of this paper ,",
    "we first recalibrate fwhm [ o iii ] @xmath35007 as a predictor of @xmath2 without assuming a gaussian profile (  2.1 )",
    ". then we construct a radio - loud quasar sample using the sdss for which we can measure m@xmath4-@xmath2 and compare it to radio - core dominance , an orientation indicator (  2.2 ) .",
    "we calculate the correlation matrix for quantities of interest (  3 ) , finding strong orientation effects as expected .",
    "we discuss prospects for , and challenges with , using our results to estimate orientation for quasars in general (  4 ) .",
    "we also discuss the nature of a surprising new class of outliers having extremely broad emission lines but large radio core dominance that may be merger products (  4 ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions (  5 ) .",
    "instead of assuming a profile shape for the narrow [ o iii ] @xmath35007 emission line or relationship with the stellar velocity dispersion , we prefer to empirically calibrate fwhm@xmath6}$ ] as a predictor of @xmath2 .",
    "this has been previously done ( e.g. , boroson 2003 , gaskell 2009b ) , but we can now do this with much larger samples with the same quality of spectra that we will work with throughout this investigation .",
    "we started with the sample of shen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who measured @xmath2 from stellar absorption lines in more than 900 broad - lined agns with spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "their measurements included corrections for instrumental resolution and aperture effects .",
    "they did not make any measurements of the narrow [ o iii ] profiles , however .",
    "we downloaded sdss spectra for these objects and made our own measurements . along with a local continuum and an appropriately broadened fe ii template ( boroson & green 1992 ) , we fit [ o iii ] @xmath35007 and [ o iii ] @xmath34959 simultaneously with a fixed 3:1 intensity ratio , using the same profile comprised of the sum of two skewed gaussians with different peak wavelengths allowed to vary .",
    "this mathematical function satisfactorily reproduced the full range of observed [ o iii ] profiles in the sample . from these analytical fits , we numerically determined the fwhm .",
    "we obtained the instrumental resolution at the wavelength of [ o iii ] @xmath35007 from the sdss headers and subtracted this in quadrature from the observed fwhm to determine an intrinsic fwhm .",
    "this is an important step because the smallest fwhm values are not much larger than the intrinsic spectral resolution .",
    "we determined errors using an empirical formula based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "we created a grid of artificial [ o iii ] profiles with a range in signal - to - noise ratios and equivalent widths spanning those seen in our data set . for each grid point",
    ", we created 50 artificial spectra with random gaussian noise added at different levels and measured profile properties .",
    "the distribution of measurements provides the uncertainties for the grid .",
    "we then employed multiple regression using signal - to - noise ratio and equivalent width as predictors of the uncertainty and used the resulting fit to determine individual error bars .",
    "the mean uncertainty on our final fwhm [ o iii ] measurements was 11@xmath73% .",
    "we excluded a number of objects for several reasons . upon visual inspection , some spectra had poor signal - to - noise ratios or other spectral defects in the region of [ o iii ] compromising our fits .",
    "some spectra show double - peaked [ o iii ] profiles , which are of interest as binary candidates ( e.g. , fu et al . 2011 ) , but which are unlikely to be representative of typical line profiles and might skew our work .",
    "a few spectra would not properly download from the sdss servers .",
    "our final sample consists of 773 objects .",

    "figure 2 plots log m@xmath8 against log @xmath2 for the radio - loud sample ( filled circles ) , and , in order to cover a wider range in parameter space to put our work in context , the objects from shen et al . ( 2008 ) we used to develop equation 1 ( open circles ) using self - consistent measurements .",
    "we also show a line fit for the local quiescent galaxy m-@xmath2 relation ( mcconnell & ma 2013 ) .",
    "our selection criteria lead to the sample containing most luminous and massive systems at z @xmath10 0.75 , which are not representative of the full range of quasar properties .",
    "the points for our sample sit well above the local m-@xmath9 relationship , consistent with the work of gaskell ( 2009b ) and salviander & shields ( 2013 ) who used a similar approach employing similar proxies for mass and stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "they also found the most massive black holes shifted above the quiescent galaxy line .",
    "being rare and luminous objects , our radio - loud quasars also sit at higher redshifts than the shen et al .",

    "the m-@xmath9 relation for quasars in our individual and combined samples changes with @xmath11 , as salviander & shields ( 2013 ) also found , and likely for the same reasons , involving a variety of selection biases , although they do not absolutely rule out true evolution .     against log @xmath2 relation for our radio - loud sample ( filled circles ) using estimates of these parameters from the se black hole mass scaling relationship using h@xmath1 ( vp06 ) and equation 1 .",
    "the representative error bar displayed represents the scatter in the predictive equations rather than measurement errors , which are very much smaller .",
    "for reference , we have also plotted the objects from figure 1 ( open circles ) , which are on average lower redshift and luminosity , using for consistency the same proxies to estimate mass and velocity dispersion .",

    "we note several differences , however .",
    "in particular , the upper right part of the figure is empty in wills & browne ( 1986 ) but has a small population of objects in our sample .",
    "this likely arises in part from contamination from css sources , but some of these quasars , when checked in nasa s extragalactic database ( ned ) , have radio spectra that are flat , not steep",
    ". we also note that our sample has few sources with log r @xmath12 , likely a result of excluding sources without close sdss - first core matches as well as the relatively high - frequency selection of first and nvss at 1.4 ghz ; wills & browne ( 1986 ) use quasars mainly selected from low - frequency surveys that yield more lobe - dominant objects .    .",
    "the uncertainties on log r are likely dominated by systematic issues as discussed in the text and are not always well determined , while the uncertainties on log fwhm h@xmath1 are @xmath130.04 dex , very small compared to the sample parameter range .",
    ", width=8 ]    figure 4 shows a plot of log of the mass ratio m@xmath8/m@xmath14 against log fwhm h@xmath1 .",
    "this may be compared to a similar figure by shen & ho s ( 2014 ) , also figure 4 , where they plot the ratio of m@xmath14 to the h@xmath1 virial product , the so - called `` f - factor '' used to empirically correct h@xmath1-based masses for unknown geometric effects .",
    "the scatter in m@xmath8/m@xmath14 for a given fwhm is roughly consistent with that expected from the scatter in the proxies used to construct the ratio . unlike shen & ho ( 2014 ) , we do not see statistically significant improvement in the correlation if we create subsamples by binning in m@xmath14 , perhaps because of our different parameter space and/or additional scatter from using fwhm [ o iii ] as a proxy . in principle ,",
    "m@xmath14 should normalize the h@xmath1-based mass , as neither fwhm [ o iii ] nor the predicted @xmath2 are significantly correlated with log r , consistent with brotherton ( 1996 ) .",
    "we note that the average of the mass ratio is not unity , as we have already shown how the most massive quasars sit systematically above the local / quiescent galaxy m-@xmath2 relationship used to determine m@xmath14 .",
    "if the m-@xmath15 relationship is consistent for this sample , then mass variations can not drive the correlation .",
    "the uncertainties on fwhm h@xmath1 , which enter into quantities on both axes , are too small to drive the correlation .",
    "we therefore conclude , like shen & ho ( 2014 ) whose sample was primarily radio - quiet quasars , that a major part of the variation in fwhm h@xmath1 arises from orientation effects , and that it is reflected in the m@xmath8/m@xmath14 ratio .",
    "table 5 shows a highly significant correlation ( @xmath16 ) between m@xmath8/m@xmath14 and log r , which we plot in figure 5 .",
    "there is significant scatter , and caveats about the possible intrinsic variation in the m-@xmath2 relation apply , but we can again use the ols y on x regression line to predict log r from the orientation - biased mass ratio :    @xmath17    because of the large scatter , we would caution against using this relationship for individual quasars . furthermore , because of the contamination of some fraction of expected css sources in the upper right portion of the distribution , which would have much smaller log r values if measured with a survey with higher spatial resolution than first , the slope of the above equation is likely steeper in reality .",

    "although there is still similar scatter , the accuracy is improved by removing orientation effects as the spearman rank correlation coefficient is reduced from a highly significant @xmath210.203 ( two - tailed probability @xmath22 of arising by chance ) to an insignificant @xmath23 ( two - tailed probability of 99% of arising by chance ) .",
    "this test uses a different sample than runnoe et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , and also a different way of normalizing the black hole mass ( based on @xmath2 rather than the c iv @xmath31549 line ) , represents independent support for their mass correction term using log r. while it has been clear for some time that h@xmath1-based black hole mass determinations possess an orientation bias , we have now quantified the effect and provided additional evidence that we can correct for it , at least statistically .",
    "/m@xmath14 is plotted against log r , although this time m@xmath8 has been corrected for orientation bias using equation 5 from runnoe et al .",

    ", width=8 ]",
    "previous work and our results establish that black hole masses determined using the broad @xmath24 emission line suffer orientation bias , certainly in radio - loud quasars and very likely in radio - quiet quasars as well ( e.g. , krolik 2001 ; collin et al .",
    "based on the investigation of runnoe et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , this is also true using alternative velocity measurements like the line dispersion @xmath25 and true for mg ii @xmath32800 , which behaves similar to h@xmath1 .",
    "quantitatively the bias is close to an order of magnitude over the observed full range of quasar orientations , and represents a significant amount of scatter in many applications ( e.g. , studying m-@xmath2 as in salviander & shields 2013 ) .",
    "there is no reason to think that reverberation mapping black hole masses are immune from orientation effects , although this would be good to confirm observationally .",
    "orientation also affects optical luminosity ( e.g. , nemmen & brotherton 2010 , runnoe et al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) , which can manifest in numerous ways .",
    "for instance , flux - limited samples possess strong orientation biases that can change the slope and normalization of quasar luminosity functions ( e.g. , dipompeo et al .",
    "we agree with the conclusions of shen & ho ( 2014 ) that orientation is an important parameter affecting the appearance of type 1 quasars , above and beyond being a primary reason for type 1 and type 2 agns more generally ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) .    as a practical matter",
    ", having multiple estimators for quasar black hole mass , that can be computed without radio observations and that have different dependencies on orientation , offers the promise of an orientation indicator that can be used in all quasars , radio - loud and radio - quiet alike .",
    "such a general orientation indicator could be used to look for orientation bias , as well as to correct for its effects .",
    "the ratio of an orientation - biased black hole mass to one derived from an unbiased stellar velocity dispersion @xmath2 , or a reasonable proxy like fwhm [ o iii ] , can serve as a rough orientation indicator .",
    "there remain issues to consider besides the scatter .",
    "the intrinsic m-@xmath2 ratio may vary with agn type , the host galaxy type , the black hole mass , and perhaps redshift as well ( in addition to discussions by gaskell 2009b and salviander & shields 2013 , see also bennert et al .",
    "20011 , kormendy & ho 2013 , woo et al .",
    "2015 , and others ) .",
    "one additional issue we propose here is an orientation effect with luminosity .",
    "if ideas about a receding torus and a correlation between luminosity and opening angle are correct ( e.g. , lawrence 1991 ; ma & wang 2013 ) , then more luminous quasars will be on average seen at larger viewing angles .",
    "this in turn will mean that they will on average have larger fwhm h@xmath1 and therefore correspondingly larger black hole mass estimates when using h@xmath1 single - epoch scaling relationships .",
    "this effect could contribute to more luminous quasars also sitting higher in m-@xmath9 diagrams like our figure 2 .",
    "these topics are of course of great interest and study in their own right .",
    "because of the large amount of scatter between these parameters , this predictive equation is unlikely to be reliable for determining orientation in individual objects .",
    "however , given the large numbers of quasars now being routinely studied , it may prove useful for statistical studies .",
    "there may also be opportunities to improve the relationship and reduce scatter .",
    "we previously discussed some caveats associated with the use of the first survey to determine radio core dominance .",
    "certainly there are some compact steep spectrum quasars that would have small values of log r if observed at higher spatial resolution , but are interpreted as jet - on quasars with large core dominance .",
    "this effect creates extra scatter in figures 3 and 5 .",
    "a fraction of our sample has additional radio measurements available from the westerbork northern sky survey at 325 mhz ( wenss , rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) . some of the objects with both large log r and fwhm h@xmath1 that sit in the upper right corner of figure 3 , an empty area in the plot of wills & browne ( 1986 ) , do indeed have steep radio spectra .",
    "some , however , have flat spectra and probably do indeed represent jet - on systems .",
    "if the scenario of wills & browne ( 1986 ) , proposing that h@xmath1 is emitted from a disc - shaped blr in the plane perpendicular to the jet axis , is right , how could some of these jet - on systems show the broadest h@xmath1 lines of all ?",
    "for example , sdss j161826.93 + 081950.7 has log r = 1.76 and a flat radio spectrum , but also fwhm h@xmath1 = 24,000 km s@xmath26 , one of the broadest broad emission lines ever seen in a quasar .",
    "suggestive is the fact that the [ o iii ] profile has a bump on the blue side , indicating that it is perhaps double - peaked , which has been previously noted by , e.g. , smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and fu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who included the quasar as a binary candidate .",
    "we propose that these rare objects , with apparently misaligned jet and blr axes , could result from recent mergers .",
    "that is , a merger has already occurred and changed the system spin axis seen on large scales vs. small scales .",
    "thus we see the large scale radio structure as indicating a jet - on orientation , but the broad line region is more edge - on .",
    "follow - up investigations of the jets on millarcsecond scales with vlbi would be of interest .",
    "we recalibrated fwhm [ o iii ] as a proxy for @xmath2 using the sample and measurements of shen et al .",
    "we then constructed a sample of radio - loud quasars based on a combination of sdss , nvss , and first catalogs and measured fwhm [ o iii ] in order to predict @xmath2 .",
    "we found that single - epoch scaling relationship estimates of black hole mass using h@xmath1 appear to be strongly correlated with radio - based orientation indicators , even when normalized by mass determinations from the m-@xmath2 relation , consistent with some previous work .",
    "we discussed using the ratio of biased quasar black hole mass to stellar velocity dispersion as an orientation indicator , as well as a small population of outliers with both large log r and fwhm h@xmath1 , which may represent recently merged systems .",
