    "von neumann has established a general framework for quantum measurement by postulating that any indirect measurement can be decomposed into two distinct parts  @xcite .",
    "the first part involves unitary transformation that transfers the information of interest from the measured system to the measuring apparatus .",
    "the second part involves nonunitary transformation that achieves the realization of a particular outcome of the measurement by the projection postulate .",
    "the adjective indirect implies that the projection postulate is applied not to the measured system but to the measuring apparatus . as an illustrative example , von neumann constructed a model for the position measurement of a massive particle which is referred to as von neumann measurement ( vnm ) .",
    "vnm satisfies heisenberg s noise - disturbance uncertainty relation  @xcite and sets the standard quantum limit ( sql )  @xcite on the accuracy of repeated position measurements .",
    "this noise - disturbance uncertainty relation refers to a trade - off relation between the noise added to a system s observable and the disturbance generated in the conjugate observable due to the back - action of the measurement .",
    "the measurement _ noise _ of observable @xmath0 is defined by the difference between the probability distribution of obtaining a measurement outcome and the corresponding probability distribution calculated from the premeasurement state of the system according to born s probability axiom  @xcite .",
    "if there is no difference for an arbitrary input state of the system , then the measurement of observable @xmath0 is said to be _",
    "noiseless_. in 1983 , yuen suggested the possibility of a contractive state measurement ( csm ) in which heisenberg s noise - disturbance uncertainty relation is violated and the sql is surpassed  @xcite .",
    "ozawa subsequently presented a concrete model that vindicates yuen s conjecture  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss a swapping state measurement ( ssm ) in which quantum states are exchanged between the measured system and the measuring apparatus before the projection postulate is applied to the apparatus  @xcite . while vnm , csm , and ssm are all noiseless , ssm is unique in that it is noiseless for an arbitrary observable . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gravitation ] , ssm has the advantage over csm in gravitational - wave detection in respect of experimental implementation of the measuring apparatus .",
    "ssm is shown to be described with three sum gates , where the sum gate is the continuous - variable counterpart of the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , vnm and csm can be respectively described with one and two sum gates  @xcite .",

    "the foregoing discussion suggests that , from an experimental point of view , it would be more convenient to use the swap operator than the von neumann operator .",
    "an analogous situation in a spin-1/2 system has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ app : single_mode ] , it is also possible to express an arbitrary unitary circuit in terms of the phase shift operator , swap operator , and single - mode squeezing operator .",
    "this implies that an arbitrary unitary circuit can be implemented using phase shifters , beam splitters and degenerate parametric amplifiers .",
    "we have analyzed noiseless quantum measurements in a two - level system and a continuous - variable system and have shown that there is complete parallelism between the two - level and continuous - variable systems . as a consequence , we can categorize those measurements into three classes .",
    "the first class is described by a vnm model .",
    "this model is composed of a cnot gate or a sum gate , and the simplest among the three classes . however , it can not break heisenberg s noise - disturbance uncertainty relation because the probability distribution for the outcome of the measurement depends on the initial state of the probe .",
    "the second class is described by a csm model .",
    "this model is composed of two cnot gates or two sum gates .",
    "this model can break heisenberg s noise - disturbance uncertainty relation because the probability distribution for the outcome is independent of the initial state of the probe .",
    "the functional form of postmeasurement wave function , @xmath108 , is arbitrary ; however , outcome @xmath114 of the measurement does affect it as a shift of the coordinate as shown in eq .  .",
    "the third class is described by an ssm model .",
    "this model is composed of three cnot gates or three sum gates . from the viewpoint of experimental realization , this is the simplest of the three models .",
    "this model also can break heisenberg s noise - disturbance uncertainty relation .",
    "we can choose the postmeasurement state to be arbitrary and to depend neither on the outcome of the measurement nor on the observable to be measured .",
    "the initialization of the state of the system is therefore straightforward .",
    "moreover , the ssm circuit does not depend on the observable to be measured , because the ssm circuit exchanges quantum states between the system and the probe .",
    "therefore , the ssm circuit can be used for noiseless measurement of an arbitrary observable .      in the analysis of continuous - variable systems ,",
    "we have introduced scaling parameter @xmath76 .",
    "the degree of freedom afforded by this parameter can be used to improve the resolution of the probe .    as an example , let us consider the case in which the wave function of the system is sharply localized around two points a and b. we assume that the probability distribution vanishes at the midpoint between a and b. if the resolution of the apparatus is large compared with the distance between a and b , we can not distinguish between outcomes a and b from the position measurement .",
    "however , if we introduce scaling parameter @xmath76 into the measurement , we can extend the distance between a and b by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , if we choose an appropriate scaling parameter , we can distinguish between outcomes a and b.      the crucial concept in gravitational - wave detection is the standard quantum limit ( sql ) for a free - mass position .",
    "if a measurement model does not break the sql , the model can not detect gravitational waves .",
    "it is known that csm for position measurement is an example that breaks the sql  @xcite .",
    "we can easily understand , if the wave function of the probe is prepared in a contractive state , ssm also can break the sql  @xcite .    in respect of csm",
    ", if the measurement outcome of the system is @xmath210 , it is necessary to measure in the next measurement the position shift from @xmath210 which is a random variable .",
    "since the probe for gravitational - wave detection requires a very precise measurement of the position , we should use a probe having fine resolution in a certain range over which the value of the outcome is distributed . in respect of ssm , however , the postmeasurement system state is independent of the measurement outcome .",
    "therefore , we only have to use the probe with fine resolution in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "in this paper , we have classified noiseless quantum measurements into three classes in both two - level and continuous - variable systems .",
    "we have analyzed the unitary transformation associated with each of these models by using quantum circuits .",
    "we have proposed a model for swapping state measurement ( ssm ) as a noiseless measurement for an arbitrary observable .",
    "ssm exchanges quantum states between the system and the probe before the projection postulate is applied to the probe .",
    "ssm therefore has the property that the measurement disturbance depends neither on the observable nor on the outcome of the measurement , and consequently the corresponding unitary circuit does not depend on the observable .",
