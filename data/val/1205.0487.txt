    "the theoretical description of quantum decay refers to the time evolution @xmath0 of an initial state @xmath1 in a system characterized by a hamiltonian @xmath2 . in some decay problems it is not convenient to separate the hamiltonian into a part with stationary states and a part which is responsible for the decay , usually treated to some order of perturbation , but rather to consider the full hamiltonian @xmath2 to the system",
    "this is usually the case when the decay originates by tunneling through a classically forbidden region . as is well known , following the work by khalfin @xcite , if the energy spectra @xmath3 of the system is bounded by below , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 , the exponential decay law can not hold at long times . at short times",
    "there is also a departure from the exponential decaying behavior which is related , however , to the existence of the energy moments of the hamiltonian @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these both type of behaviors have been confirmed experimentally in recent times @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this work goes back to the early times of quantum mechanics . in 1928 , gamow introduced the notion of resonant state to describe the time evolution of decay of @xmath5 particles in radioactive nuclei @xcite . in order to describe the above process ,",
    "gamow considered solutions to the schr \" odinger equation which at large distances consist only of purely outgoing waves .",
    "this is physically appealing because it yields an outward flux for the decaying particle outside the interaction region .",
    "he realized , however , that the absence of incoming waves in the solution at large distances leads to complex energy eigenvalues .",
    "this was in a way satisfactory because it led to the interpretation of the imaginary part of the energy as the inverse of the lifetime @xmath6 in the exponential decay law @xmath7 , and thus it provided a theoretical framework for the understanding of the exponential decay law in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , his approach constituted one of the first successful applications of quantum mechanics involving tunneling phenomena and also one of the first theoretical treatments of open quantum systems .",
    "however , since the amplitude of resonant states increases exponentially with distance , the usual rules of normalization , orthogonality and completeness do not apply . nonetheless , over the years in spite of these apparent drawbacks , a consistent theoretical framework involving resonant states evolved over the years @xcite .",
    "the approach involving _ resonant states _ represents a non - hermitian formulation that lies strictly outside the usual hermitian framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , there is a traditional view that considers the non - hermitian description of quantum decay involving complex energy eigenvalues as an approximate , phenomenological description that can not be fundamental because it violates the requirement of unitarity @xcite . the formulation of decay involving _ continuum wave functions _ requires of numerical integration over the wave number for each value of the time @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that the approaches mentioned above may lead to results for the time evolution of decay that are numerically indistinguishable from each other @xcite .",
    "so the question naturally arises of how these very different formulations of decay lead to the same numerical results .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the genesis of the above two formulations , hermitian and non - hermitian , for the decay process using the analytical properties of the outgoing green s function to the problem in the complex @xmath8 plane .",
    "we intend to answer or at least to throw some light in understanding the question posed at the end of the above paragraph .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ two ] some general properties of the time - dependent wave solution involving the outgoing green s function to the problem are briefly discussed .",
    "subsection [ three ] refers to the continuum wave solutions and provides a derivation for time - dependent solution in terms of continuum states .",
    "subsection [ fourth ] yields a discussion on the formalism of resonant states and yields an expression for the time - dependent solution in terms of resonant states . in section [ fifth ] , we illustrate equivalence between the basis of continuum and resonant states for the @xmath9-shell potential .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sixth ] gives the concluding remarks .",
    "we shall consider a very simple , yet no trivial , description of the time evolution of decay of a particle that is confined initially in a real spherical potential of arbitrary shape in three dimensions . without loss of generality",
    "we restrict the discussion to @xmath10 waves and it is worth mentioning that the description holds also on the half - line in one dimension .",
    "it is also assumed that the interaction potential @xmath11 vanishes after a finite distance , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 for @xmath13",
    ". however , as discussed below , the results obtained hold also for potentials that go faster than exponentials at very large distances .",
    "the units employed here are @xmath14 .",
    "let us therefore write the time - dependent schrdinger equation as @xmath15 \\psi(r , t)=0 , \\label{d1}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) may be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the retarded time - dependent green s function to the problem .",
    "this function describes the time evolution of the system for @xmath19 and has vanishing value for @xmath20 @xcite . clearly , in order to obtain the time - dependent solution one must know @xmath21 . a convenient form to determine",
    "this quantity is by expressing it in terms of the outgoing green s function to the problem @xmath22 . for @xmath19 ,",
    "both quantities are related by using the laplace transform method @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , before taking the radius of the semicircle @xmath25 up to infinity , corresponds to the contour in the complex k plane shown in fig .",

    "and its deformation along the complex k plane used to derive eq .",

    "the exponential factor in the integrand of ( [ d9 ] ) guarantees that the contour @xmath25 along the second quadrant of the k plane vanishes as the radius of the semicircle goes to infinity . as",
    "a result @xmath21 becomes @xmath26 in deriving the above expression we have assumed also for simplicity , since decay refers to a process where the particle tunnels out into the continuum , that the potential does not hold bound states .",
    "equation ( [ d10 ] ) is the central quantity to study the dynamics of decay and it is the starting point to analyze the genesis of the descriptions involving _ continuum wave functions _ and _ resonant states_. one sees that it depends on the outgoing green s function and hence it is convenient to refer first to some of its properties .",

    "the outgoing green s function may be written in terms of the so called _ regular _ , @xmath30 , and _ irregular _ , @xmath31 , solutions to the schrdinger equation and the jost function as @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand respectively for the smaller and larger of @xmath29 and @xmath35 .",

    "the _ regular _ and _ irregular _ solutions satisfy , respectively , integral equations that are of the _ volterra _ type and hence may be solved by iteration @xcite .",
    "this leads to certain conditions on the behavior of the interaction potential @xmath44 as a function of the distance @xmath29 .",
    "these are that the first and second moments of @xmath44 must be finite , which imply , respectively , that the potential is less singular near the origin that @xmath45 and goes faster than @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , it is required that @xmath48 , with @xmath49 a real quantity .",
    "in particular , if the potential decreases faster than exponential at infinity , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are entire functions of @xmath8 in the whole complex @xmath8 plane .",
    "this is the case considered in this work , where the interaction vanishes beyond a distance , but holds also for other type of potentials , as for example , potentials with gaussian tails .",

    "\\label{d26a}\\ ] ] the jost functions may also be expressed as @xcite @xmath59 and for real values of @xmath8 one has @xmath60 .",
    "a consequence of the above considerations is that the outgoing green s function @xmath22 is single valued and analytical in the whole complex @xmath8 plane except at an infinite number of poles that correspond to the zeros of the jost function @xmath61 . for potentials that vanish after a distance these poles are in general simple and we shall assume that this is the case here .",
    "one finds , in general , a finite number of them may seat on the positive and negative imaginary @xmath8 axis , corresponding respectively to bound and antibound states , and thatban infinite number are located on the lower half of the @xmath8 plane where , due to time - reversal considerations , are distributed symmetrically with respect to the imaginary @xmath8 axis , corresponding , as discussed below , to resonant states .",
