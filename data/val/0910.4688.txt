    "we are interested in the problem of quickest detection of the onset of a signal in a system of @xmath0 sensors .",
    "we consider the situation in which , although the observations in one sensor can affect the observations in another , the onset of a signal can occur at different times ( i.e. , change points ) in each of the @xmath0 sensors ; that is , the change points differ from sensor to sensor . as an example in which this situation arises",
    "consider a system of sensors monitoring the health of a physical structure in which fault conditions are manifested by vibrations in the structure . before a change affects a given sensor",
    ", we have only noise in that sensor .",
    "then , after a change , the system is vibrating and thus the signal received in any location reflects a vibrating system .",
    "thus , observations at any given sensor are coupled with those received in other locations .",
    "the change points observed at different sensors can occur at different times because the source of the vibrations ( i.e. , the excitation ) may arrive at different structural elements at different times .",
    "relevant literature related to such models includes , for example , @xcite .",
    "we assume that the probability law of the observations is the same across sensors .",
    "this assumption although seemingly restrictive , is realistic in view of the fact the system of sensors is coupled .",
    "we model the signals through continuous - time it processes .",
    "the advantage of such models is the fact that they can capture complex dependencies in the observations .",
    "for example , an autoregressive process is a special case of the discrete - time equivalent of an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , which in turn , is a special case of an it process .",
    "other special cases of this model include markovian models , and linear state - space systems commonly used in vibration - based structural analysis and health monitoring problems @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the fact that the system of @xmath0 sensors is coupled makes the probabilistic treatment of the problem equivalent to the one in which all observations become available in one location .",
    "the reason is that one integrated information flow is sufficient for describing such a system .",
    "our objective is to detect the first onset of a signal in such a system .",
    "so far in the literature of this type of problem ( see @xcite ) it has been assumed that the change points are the same across sensors .",
    "recently the case was also considered of change points that propagate in a sensor array @xcite . however , in this configuration the propagation of the change points depends on the identity of the first sensor affected and considers a restricted markovian mechanism of propagation of the change .",
    "in this paper we consider the case in which the change points can be different and do not propagate in any specific configuration .",
    "the objective is to detect the minimum ( i.e. , the first ) of the change points .",
    "we demonstrate that , in the situation described above , at least asymptotically , the minimum of @xmath0 cusums is asymptotically optimal in detecting the minimum of the @xmath0 different change points , as the mean time between false alarms tends to @xmath1 , with respect to an appropriately extended kullback - leibler divergence criterion criterion @xcite that incorporates the possibility of @xmath0 different change points .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem , discuss special cases of our it models and demonstrate asymptotic optimality ( as the mean time between false alarms tends to @xmath1 ) , in an extended min - max kullback - leibler sense , of the minimum of @xmath0 cusum stopping times .",
    "we finally discuss extensions of these results to the case of different structures of observations in each sensor .",
    "we sequentially observe the processes @xmath2 for all @xmath3 . in order to formalize this problem",
    "we consider the measurable space @xmath4 , where @xmath5^n$ ] and @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the processes @xmath2 for all @xmath3 are assumed to have the following dynamics : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a process on the same probability space adapted to the filtration @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent standard brownian motion .",
    "the case considered in this paper that in which @xmath12 is the same for all @xmath13 . this can be described as a signal symmetry across sensors .",
    "we notice that @xmath10 is the filtration generated by the observations received by all sensors .",
    "thus by requiring that @xmath12 be @xmath14-measurable for all @xmath13 , we have managed to capture the coupled nature of the system . in particular , in the special case in which , say , @xmath15 , ( [ itodynamics ] ) describes a process which displays an autoregressive ( or its continuous equivalent @xcite ) behavior in @xmath16 , while still being coupled with the observations received by the other sensors . more specifically , the magnitude of each increment of the process @xmath16 at each instant @xmath17 is not only affected by @xmath18 but also by @xmath19 , @xmath20 the observations at sensor @xmath21 .",
    "this couples the observations received in sensor @xmath22 with those received in sensors @xmath21 at each instant @xmath17 and results in a system of interdependent sensors .",
    "we notice that the special case described above can also be written in the form of a linear state - space model as follows : @xmath23 autoregressive models and , more generally , linear state space models have been used to capture seismic signals , navigation systems , vibrating mechanical systems , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another special case of ( [ itodynamics ] ) is @xmath24 a model that describes sinusoidal waves driven by noise .",
    "such a model could also be used to capture vibrating mechanical systems .",
    "the generality of [ itodynamics ] however is much greater than the special cases described above .",
    "this is seen in the fact that @xmath12 at each instant @xmath17 can depend on the totality of the observed paths of each of the signals received up to time @xmath17 .    on the space @xmath25 , we have the following family of probability measures @xmath26 , where @xmath27 corresponds to the measure generated on @xmath25 by the processes @xmath28 when the change in the @xmath0-tuple process occurs at time point @xmath29 , @xmath3 .",
    "notice that the measure @xmath30 corresponds to the measure generated on @xmath25 by @xmath0 independent standard brownian motions .",
    "our objective is to find a stopping rule @xmath31 that balances the trade - off between a small detection delay subject to a lower bound on the mean - time between false alarms and will ultimately detect @xmath32 . in what follows we will use @xmath33 to denote @xmath32 .",
    "to this effect we propose a generalization of the @xmath34 of @xcite , namely    @xmath35    where the supremum over @xmath36 is taken over the set in which @xmath37 .",
    "that is , we consider the worst detection delay over all possible realizations of paths of the @xmath0-tuple of stochastic processes @xmath28 up to @xmath32 and then consider the worst detection delay over all possible @xmath0-tuples @xmath38 over a set in which at least one of them is forced to take a finite value .",
    "this is because @xmath31 is a stopping rule meant to detect the minimum of the @xmath0 change points and therefore if one of the @xmath0 processes undergoes a regime change , any unit of time by which @xmath31 delays in reacting , should be counted towards the detection delay .",
    "this gives rise to the following stochastic optimization problem : @xmath39    the criterion in ( [ jkl ] ) can be similarly motivated by considering the average over all sensors of the kullback - leibler divergence : @xmath40 where the last equality follows as long as @xmath41 for all @xmath3 and all @xmath42 .",
    "using an argument similar to the randomization argument of @xcite , it is also possible to show that the optimal stopping rule @xmath43 must be an equalizer rule in that it would react at exactly the same time regardless of which change takes place first . in order to demonstrate this fact we begin by noting that minimization of ( [ jkl ] ) is equivalent to minimizing @xmath44    now define @xmath45 for @xmath3 .",
    "that is , @xmath46 is the detection delay of the stopping rule @xmath31 when @xmath47",
    ". then @xmath48 the optimal solution to ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) , @xmath43 , satisfies @xmath49 to see this , let us consider the case when @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath31 be a stopping rule such that @xmath51 .",
    "consider another stopping rule @xmath52 , which stops as @xmath31 does , but observes @xmath53 in place of @xmath18 and @xmath18 in place of @xmath53 .",
    "it follows that @xmath54 we trivially also have that @xmath55 now let us use a binary random variable @xmath56 , which is independent of @xmath10 , to construct a randomized stopping rule adapted to @xmath57 , @xmath58 it is easy to observe that @xmath59 and @xmath60~<~j_2^{(2)}(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies @xmath61 by ( [ decomp ] ) .",
    "therefore the optimal solution to ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) must satisfy ( [ a ] ) of equation ( [ that ] ) is measurable with respect to the enlarged filtration @xmath62 , the optimal solution to ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) must be adapted to the original filtration @xmath63 . ] .    for a fixed @xmath13 , and the dynamics of ( [ itodynamics ] ) the cusum stopping rule is @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath3 and @xmath67    in the case that @xmath68 , in which the drift denoted by @xmath69 is measurable with respect to the filtration generated by only one process , say @xmath70 the cusum stopping rule ( [ cusumito ] ) is optimal in minimizing the kullback - leibler divergence criterion of @xcite subject to the false alarm constraint @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 in ( [ cusumito ] ) is chosen so that @xmath73 , with @xmath74 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath75 the fact that the worst detection delay is the same as that incurred in the case in which the change point is exactly @xmath76 is a consequence of the non - negativity of the cusum process , from which it follows that the worst detection delay occurs when the cusum process at the time of the change is at @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the cusum stopping rule ( [ cusumito ] ) is an optimal solution to one - dimensional problem of detecting one change - point in the one - dimensional equivalent of ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is important however to point out that a vital assumption necessary for the optimality of the cusum ( [ cusumito ] ) in @xcite is @xmath77 this assumption ensures the a.s .",
    "finiteness of the cusum stopping time ( see @xcite ) , whose physical interpretation is that the signal received after the change point has sufficient energy .",
    "we will thus assume that conditions ( [ energy ] ) are satisfied for all processes @xmath78 .",
    "we remark here that if the @xmath0 change points were the same then the problem ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) is equivalent to observing only one stochastic process which is now @xmath0-dimensional .",
    "thus , in this case , the detection delay and mean time between false alarms are given by the formulas in the above paragraph .",
    "returning to problem ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) , it is easily seen that in seeking solutions to this problem , we can restrict our attention to stopping times that achieve the false alarm constraint with equality @xcite .",
    "the optimality of the cusum stopping rule in the presence of only one observation process suggests that a cusum type of stopping rule might display similar optimality properties in the case of multiple observation processes . in particular , an intuitively appealing rule ,",
    "when the detection of @xmath32 is of interest , is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the cusum stopping rule for the process @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "that is , we use what is known as a multi - chart cusum stopping time @xcite , which can be written as @xmath81    where @xmath82    and the @xmath83 are the restrictions of the measure @xmath27 to @xmath84 .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ cusummultichart ] ) is an equalizer rule .",
    "that is , it satisfies ( [ a ] ) .",
    "this follows from the assumption that @xmath85 are the same for all @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath86    this is because the worst detection delay occurs when at least one of the @xmath0 processes does not change regime .",
    "thus , the worst detection delay will occur when none of the other processes changes regime and due to the non - negativity of the cusum process the worst detection delay will occur when the remaining one processes is exactly at @xmath76 .",
    "notice that the threshold @xmath87 is used for the multi - chart cusum stopping rule ( [ cusummultichart ] ) in order to distinguish it from @xmath72 the threshold used for the one sided cusum stopping rule ( [ cusumito ] ) .    in",
    "what follows we will demonstrate asymptotic optimality of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) as @xmath88 .",
    "in view of the constraint in ( [ eqnproblemklg ] ) , the assumption that @xmath85 are the same for all @xmath13 and ( [ eq ] ) , in order to assess the optimality properties of the multi - chart cusum rule ( [ cusummultichart ] ) , we will need to begin by evaluating @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    in order to demonstrate asymptotic optimality of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) we bound the detection delay @xmath91 of the unknown optimal stopping rule @xmath43 by @xmath92 where @xmath87 is chosen so that @xmath93 it is also obvious that @xmath94 is bounded from below by the detection delay of the one cusum when there is only one observation process , in view of the fact that @xmath95 where @xmath69 is measurable w.r.t .",
    "the filtration generated by the @xmath22-dimensional process @xmath96 , denoted by @xmath97 , and is the projection of @xmath98 on the filtration @xmath97 .",

    "[ main ] suppose that @xmath85 are the same for all @xmath13 . then the difference in detection delay @xmath91 of the unknown optimal stopping rule @xmath43 and the detection delay of @xmath104 of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) with @xmath87 satisfying ( [ facsh ] ) is bounded above by @xmath105 as @xmath106 .",
    "* proof : * the proof follows from lemma [ asymptotics ] and ( [ asymptoticsn ] ) .    _ remark : _ since @xmath107 increases without bound as @xmath88 , theorem [ main ] asserts the asymptotic optimality of @xmath104 .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated the asymptotic optimality of the minimum of @xmath0 cusums for detecting the minimum of @xmath0 different change points in a coupled system of @xmath0 sensors which receive sequential observations from the environment .",
    "we have allowed for a general dependence structure in the observations and we have shown that the @xmath0-cusum stopping rule is asymptotically optimal , as the mean time to the first false alarm increases without bound , in detecting the minimum of @xmath0 different change - points in the sense that it minimizes a worst average kullback - leibler divergence criterion .",
    "this has been seen by the fact that the difference in detection delay of the proposed @xmath0-cusum stopping rule and the unknown optimal stopping rule is bounded above by the constant @xmath108 .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would incorporate the fact that the distributions of the signals received in different sensors may be different .",
    "in this case the fact that the optimal stopping rule has to be an equalizer rule ( i.e. satisfy ( [ a ] ) ) would determine the optimal selection of thresholds in each sensor which in the general case should be different .",
