    "in our industrialized world several important applications require reliable and accurate wind speed forecasts . these include , but are not limited to agriculture , aviation or wind energy production .",
    "in particular , high wind speeds can cause severe damages to infrastructure and their predictions are important parts of weather warnings .",
    "wind speed forecasts are standard outputs of numerical weather prediction ( nwp ) models .",
    "nwp has traditionally been viewed as a deterministic problem , but over the last decades , a change towards probabilistic forecasts , i.e. , forecasts in the form of a full predictive distribution , can be observed .",
    "probabilistic forecasts are important in the context of weather forecasting as they allow for a quantification of the associated uncertainty of the prediction , and further allow for optimal point forecasting by using certain functionals of the predictive distribution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    nowadays",
    ", weather services typically produce ensemble forecasts which consist of multiple runs of nwp models that differ in initial conditions and/or the numerical representation of the atmosphere @xcite . while the transition to ensemble forecasts is an important step towards probabilistic forecasting , ensembles are finite and do not provide full predictive densities .",
    "further , ensemble forecasts are typically underdispersive and subject to systematic bias , they thus require some form of statistical post - processing @xcite .",
    "state of the art techniques for statistical post - processing of ensemble forecasts include bayesian model averaging ( bma ) developed by @xcite , and ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) or non - homogeneous regression by @xcite .",
    "the bma approach uses weighted mixtures of parametric probability density functions ( pdfs ) which depend on the ensemble forecasts , with the mixture weights being determined based on the performance of the ensemble members in the training period .",
    "possible component choices for wind speed are given by pdfs of gamma distributions @xcite or truncated normal ( tn ) distributions @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the predictive distribution of the emos approach is given by a single parametric distribution with parameters depending on the ensemble forecasts .",
    "@xcite propose the use of truncated normal distributions for emos models of wind speed .",
    "alternative choices are given by generalized extreme value distributions @xcite , log - normal ( ln ) distributions @xcite , and combinations thereof .",
    "the article at hand builds on the emos framework and proposes models based on weighted mixtures of tn and ln distributions .",
    "this new approach allows for combining the advantages of lighter and heavier - tailed distributions , but avoids problems encountered in using previously proposed combination models .",
    "apart from the flexibility , the mixture models further exhibit desirable properties from a theoretical perspective and provide well calibrated and skillful probabilistic forecasts .",
    "the novel emos mixture approach is applied to forecasts of maximal wind speed of the 50 member ensemble of the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ; * ? ? ? * ) and the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble ( uwme ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to instantaneous wind - speed forecasts of the 11 member limited area model ensemble prediction system of the hungarian meteorological service ( hms ) called aire limite adaptation dynamique dveloppement international - hungary ensemble prediction system ( aladin - huneps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the three ensemble prediction system differ in the generation of their members , which is accounted for in the model formulation .",
    "the tn model of @xcite , and the ln and tn - ln combination models of @xcite serve as benchmark models for the three case studies .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sec2 ] contains a description of the ensembles and observational data . in section [ sec : sec3 ] the emos technique is reviewed and the novel tn - ln mixture models are introduced .",
    "section [ sec : sec4 ] summarizes the results of the three case studies .",
    "the article concludes with a discussion in section [ sec : sec5 ] .",
    "we consider three distinct data sets of ensemble forecasts and corresponding observations which differ both in the stochastic properties of the ensemble as well as the observed wind quantities .",
    "the data sets coincide with those used in @xcite .",
    "we thus limit our discussion here to a succinct summary of the data and refer to @xcite for a more detailed description .",
    "the ecmwf ensemble consists of 50 exchangeable ensemble members of one day ahead forecasts of 10 m daily maximum wind speed ( given in ms@xmath0 ) along with corresponding validating observations from 228 synoptic observation stations over germany .",
    "the observations are daily maxima of hourly observations of 10-minute average wind speed measured over the 10 minutes before the hour , where the maxima are taken over the 24 hours corresponding to the time frame of the ensemble forecast .",
    "the results presented in section [ subs : subs4.1 ] are based on a verification period from 1 may 2010 to 30 april 2011 , consisting of 83220 individual forecast cases .    to 11 cm    figure [ fig :",
    "fig1]a shows the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble , that is the histogram of ranks of validating observations with respect to the corresponding ensemble forecasts computed from the ranks at all locations and dates considered ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.7.2 ) .",
    "the strongly u - shaped histogram indicates a highly underdispersive character of the ecmwf ensemble .",
    "the range of the ecmwf ensemble contains the validating observation only in @xmath1 of all cases ( the nominal value of this coverage is @xmath2 , that is @xmath3 ) , verifying the need of statistical post - processing .",
    "the aladin - huneps system of the hms @xcite consists of 11 members , 10 exchangeable forecasts initialized from perturbed initial conditions and one control member from the unperturbed analysis .",
    "the data base contains ensembles of 42-h forecasts for 10 m wind speed ( given in ms@xmath0 ) for 10 major cities in hungary , together with the corresponding validating observations for the one - year period between 1 april 2012 and 31 march 2013 .",
    "the validating wind speed measurements are considered as instantaneous values ( valid at a given time ) , however , they are in fact mean values over the preceding 10 minutes .",
    "the model wind speed values are also considered as instantaneous , but they are representatives for a given model time step , which is 5 min in our case .",
    "similar to the ecmwf ensemble , the verification rank histogram of the raw aladin - huneps ensemble is far from the desired uniform distribution ( see figure [ fig : fig1]b ) , however , it shows a much less underdispersive character .",
    "the better fit of the ensemble can also be observed on its coverage value of @xmath4 which should be compared with the nominal coverage of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the uwme covering the pacific northwest region of western north america has eight members that are obtained from different runs of the fifth generation pennsylvania state university  national center for atmospheric research mesoscale model ( psu - ncar mm5 ) @xcite .",
    "our data base contains ensembles of 48 h forecasts and corresponding validating observations of 10 m maximal wind speed ( maximum of the hourly instantaneous wind speeds over the previous twelve hours , given in ms@xmath0 , see e.g. @xcite ) for 152 stations in the automated surface observing network @xcite .",
    "the ensemble members are not exchangeable as they are generated with initial conditions from different sources .    in the present study",
    "we investigate forecasts for calendar year 2008 with additional data from the last month of 2007 used for parameter estimation . after removing days and locations with missing data 101 stations remain where the number of days for which forecasts and validating observations are available varies between 160 and 291 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1]c shows the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble where , similar to the previous cases , one can again observe a strongly underdispersive character .",
    "the ensemble coverage equals @xmath7 , whereas the nominal coverage for eight ensemble members equals @xmath8 , that is @xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the emos predictive distribution of a future weather quantity is a single parametric distribution , where the parameters depend on the ensemble .",
    "for example , a normal distribution provides a fairly good fit for temperature and pressure @xcite , whereas wind speed requires a distribution with non - negative support .",
    "in what follows , we consider three different types of emos models : standard emos models based on a single parametric family , combination models that select one of multiple parametric distributions based on the values of suitable covariates , and new mixture models .",
    "models based on single parametric families for wind speed which employ truncated normal , log - normal or generalized extreme value distributions , as well as combination models selecting one of these distribution based on covariates have been explored in previous works ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are reviewed in section [ subs : subs3.1 ] . as an alternative choice , we propose new mixture models based on a weighted mixture of truncated normal and log - normal distributions in section [ subs : subs3.2 ] .",
    "the basic emos models from previous studies are used as benchmark models in order to assess the predictive performance of the novel mixture models in section [ sec : sec4 ] .        the emos model introduced by @xcite",
    "is based on a truncated normal ( tn ) distribution , i.e. , the predictive distribution is @xmath10 where  @xmath11  denote the ensemble of distinguishable forecasts of wind speed for a given location and time ,  @xmath12  stands for the ensemble mean , and  @xmath13  denotes the tn distribution with location  @xmath14 ,  scale  @xmath15 ,  and cut - off at zero having probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath16 where  @xmath17  and  @xmath18  are the pdf and the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the standard normal distribution , respectively .    as an alternative to the tn distribution @xcite propose the use of a log - normal ( ln ) distribution where the mean  @xmath19  and variance  @xmath20  are affine functions of the ensemble members and ensemble variance , respectively ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath21 usually the pdf of the ln distribution  @xmath22  is expressed using location  @xmath14  and shape  @xmath15  parameters and has the form @xmath23 however , it can be easily expressed in terms of mean and variance with the help of transformations @xmath24",
    "@xcite propose an emos approach based on a generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution , however , this model has the disadvantage of assigning positive probability to negative wind speed values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "location and scale / shape parameters of models and can be estimated from the training data consisting of ensemble members and verifying observations from the preceding  @xmath25  days , by optimizing an appropriate verification score ( see section [ subs : subs3.3 ] ) .",
    "emos models and are valid only in the cases when the sources of the ensemble members are clearly distinguishable , which is the case for the uwme described in section [ subs : subs2.3 ] or for the consortium for small - scale modeling germany ( cosmo - de ) ensemble of the german meteorological service @xcite .",
    "however , in most of the currently used epss some members are obtained with the help of perturbations of the initial conditions .",
    "these members are statistically indistinguishable and can be considered as exchangeable .",
    "this the case for the ecmwf and aladin - huneps ensembles described in sections [ subs : subs2.1 ] and [ subs : subs2.2 ] , respectively .",
    "suppose we have  @xmath26  ensemble members divided into  @xmath19  exchangeable groups , where the  @xmath27th  group contains  @xmath28  ensemble members such that  @xmath29 .",
    "in such situations the ensemble members within an exchangeable group should share the same parameters @xcite resulting in a tn model @xmath30 and a ln model with mean and variance @xmath31 where  @xmath32  denotes the @xmath33th member of the @xmath27th group .",
    "ln and gev distributions have heavier upper tails than the tn distribution and are therefore more appropriate to model high wind speed values . to combine this advantage with the good performance of the tn model for low and medium wind speeds @xcite and @xcite also examined a regime - switching combination method , where either a tn or a heavy - tail distribution is used depending on the median value of the ensemble forecast .",
    "if the ensemble median is below a given threshold , wind speed is modeled by a tn distribution , otherwise a gev or ln distribution is employed . the optimal threshold value for a given eps is determined during a preliminary study and it is then fixed over the whole data set .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the threshold parameter is static ( rarely updated ) and can not adapt to the changes in the ensemble .",
    "@xcite also consider a more adaptive method where the threshold parameter is re - estimated as a fixed quantile of the ensemble medians in the corresponding training period for each forecast date .",
    "however , this approach is computationally more demanding without yielding a significant improvement in predictive performance .",
    "emos models based on combining two parametric families by exclusively selecting one of them at each forecast instance also suffer from the drawback that a suitable covariate has to be chosen as a selection criterion .",
    "this necessary step limits the flexibility of the combination models in practice as the adequacy of covariates might depend on the data set at hand . while the ensemble median works reasonably well in the data sets considered in this article , this observation might change for different epss .      in order to combine the advantages of lighter and heavier - tailed distributions and to avoid the aforementioned problems in the process , we introduce new emos models based on weighted mixtures of two parametric distributions .",
    "in particular , we propose to model wind speed with a weighted mixture of models and ( or and for exchangeable ensemble members ) resulting in the predictive pdf @xmath34 where the dependence of parameters  @xmath35  and  @xmath36  on the ensemble are given by ( or ) and ( or ) and , respectively . in case of model location and scale / shape parameters of the tn and ln models together with the weight  @xmath37 $ ]  are estimated simultaneously by optimizing some verification score over the training data .",
    "note that instead of a ln distribution , in one can incorporate other non - negative laws with heavy right tails .",
    "a natural choice would be the generalized pareto distribution ( gpd ) used in extreme value theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , tests for the ensemble forecasts considered here indicate a worse predictive performance of the tn - gpd model compared with the tn - ln mixture and the benchmark models .    in comparison with the basic emos models proposed in previous work , the new mixture models exhibit desirable properties from a theoretical perspective as they do not require the exclusive choice of one of multiple parametric families and are more flexible than models based on single parametric distributions .",
    "their advantages from a practical perspective such as a significantly improved calibration will be demonstrated in section [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "the main aim of probabilistic forecasting is to access the maximal sharpness of the predictive distribution subject to calibration @xcite .",
    "calibration means a statistical consistency between the predictive distributions and the validating observations whereas sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distribution .",
    "a straightforward way to check the calibration of a probabilistic forecast is the use of probability integral transform ( pit ) histograms .",
    "the pit is defined as the value of the predictive cdf evaluated at the verifying observations @xcite and the closer the histogram to the uniform distribution , the better the calibration .",
    "pit histograms are continuous analogues of verification rank histograms , a comparison of these histograms can thus be used as a measure of the possible improvements due to statistical post - processing .    apart from the visual inspection of pit histograms , formal statistical test of uniformity can be used to assess calibration . as the pit values of multi - step ahead probabilistic forecast exhibit serial correlation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the probabilistic forecasts can not be assumed to be independent in space and time , we employ a moment - based test of uniformity proposed by @xcite which accounts for dependence in the pit values . in particular",
    ", we use the @xmath38 test of @xcite that has been demonstrated to have superior size and power properties compared to alternative choices . due to the large sample size in case of the ecmwf and uwme data , the null hypothesis of uniformity",
    "is rejected for all post - processing models . however , as our focus lies on the comparative assessment of calibration , we report bootstrap estimates of the rejection rates of the @xmath38 test based on 10000 random samples of size 2500 each .",
    "if a model exhibits superior calibration , the null hypothesis of uniformity should be rejected in fewer cases compared to a model with inferior calibration .    another approach to assess calibration",
    "is the investigation of the coverage of the  @xmath39 , @xmath40  central prediction interval , defined as the proportion of validating observations located between the lower and upper  @xmath41  quantiles of the predictive distribution , where  @xmath42  is chosen to match the nominal coverage of the raw ensemble ( ecmwf : @xmath3 ; aladin - huneps : @xmath5 ; uwme : @xmath43 ) .",
    "the coverage of a calibrated predictive pdf should be around  @xmath39  and the proposed choices of  @xmath42  allow direct comparisons with the raw ensembles .",
    "further , the average widths of these central prediction intervals provide information about the sharpness of the predictive distributions .",
    "calibration and sharpness can also be addressed simultaneously with the help of scoring rules which measure the predictive performance by numerical values assigned to pairs of probabilistic forecasts and observations @xcite .",
    "the most popular scoring rules are the logarithmic score ( logs ) , that is the negative logarithm of the predictive pdf  @xmath44  evaluated at the verifying observation , @xmath45 and the continuous ranked probability score ( crps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the crps of a cdf  @xmath46  and an observation  @xmath47  is defined as @xmath48 where  @xmath49  denotes the indicator of a set  @xmath50 .",
    "while both the crps and the logarithmic score are proper scoring rules @xcite , the crps can be expressed in the same unit as the observation .",
    "further , point forecasts such as emos and ensemble medians and means are evaluated with the help of mean absolute errors ( maes ) and root mean squared errors ( rmess ) .",
    "we remark that the former is optimal for the median , whereas the latter is for the mean @xcite .",
    "finally , to evaluate the goodness of fit of probabilistic forecasts to high wind speed values a useful tool to be considered is the threshold - weighted continuous ranked probability score ( twcrps ) @xmath51 introduced by @xcite , where  @xmath52  is a weight function . obviously",
    ",  @xmath53  yields the traditional crps defined by , while one may set  @xmath54   to address wind speeds above a given threshold  @xmath55 .",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , where the upper tail behaviors of regime - switching emos models are investigated , we consider threshold values approximately corresponding to the 90th , 95th and 99th percentiles of the wind speed observations .",
    "one can also quantify the improvement in twcrps with respect to some reference predictive cdf  @xmath56  with the help of the threshold - weighted continuous ranked probability skill score ( twcrpss ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) defined as @xmath57 this score is obviously positively oriented , and in this study the predictive cdf corresponding to the classical tn model is used as a reference .    in order to assess the statistical significance of observed score differences between the models we use formal statistical tests of equal predictive performance .",
    "diebold - mariano ( dm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tests allow to account for dependence in the forecast errors and are widely used in the econometric literature . denote the mean values of a proper scoring rule  @xmath58   for two competing probabilistic forecasts  @xmath59   and  @xmath60   by  @xmath61   and  @xmath62 ,   respectively , where  @xmath63   denotes the forecast cases in a test set  @xmath64  of size  @xmath65 .",
    "the test statistic of the dm test is given by @xmath66    where  @xmath67  is a suitable estimator of the asymptotic standard deviation of the sequence of score differences  @xmath68 .",
    "under some weak regularity assumptions ,  @xmath69 asymptotically follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of equal predictive performance .",
    "negative values of  @xmath70  indicate a better predictive performance of  @xmath71 ,   whereas  @xmath72   is preferred in case of positive values of  @xmath70 .",
    "the statistical significance of the observed values of the test statistic can be assessed by computing the corresponding p - values under the null hypothesis . following suggestions of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we estimate the autocovariance of the sequence of score differences in by the sample autocovariance up to lag @xmath73 in case of @xmath74 step ahead forecasts .",
    "the results of dm tests based on the logs , the crps and the twcrps are discussed in section [ sec : sec4 ] for the individual ensembles .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : sec1 ] , the predictive skills of the mixture model are tested on the 50 member ecmwf ensemble , the aladin - huneps ensemble of the hms and the eight - member uwme .",
    "the three epss differ both in generation of the ensemble members and in the predicted wind speed quantity .",
    "model performances are evaluated with the help of the verification scores given in section [ subs : subs3.3 ] .",
    "the basic tn , ln and tn - ln regime - switching combination emos models proposed in previous studies are used as benchmark models to assess the predictive performance of the new mixture models . for a detailed evaluation and comparison of the different basic emos models , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we further compare the forecasts based on post - processing with the raw ensemble and with climatological forecasts where the observations of the training period are considered as an ensemble .",
    "following the ideas of @xcite and @xcite the parameters of the tn , ln and tn - ln mixture models are estimated by minimizing the mean crps of the predictive cdfs and corresponding validating observations over the training period .",
    "however , in case of model the crps can be evaluated only numerically , resulting in very long optimization procedures .",
    "numerical minimization of the right - most part of equation , i.e. ,  @xmath75   leads to slightly lower computation times and better verification scores compared to minimizing alternative representations of the crps integral .    due to the large computational costs of minimum crps estimation",
    ", we also investigate maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation of the parameters .",
    "ml estimation corresponds to minimizing the mean logarithmic score which has a simple and closed form . from a theoretical statistics perspective , both estimation approaches fit into a general framework of optimum score estimation and share asymptotic properties such as consistency , see @xcite for details . in applications to post - processing ensemble forecasts , the crps is often seen as the more appropriate scoring rule for parameter estimation due to the lower sensitivity to outliers and extreme events compared to the logs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the preliminary study by @xcite suggested that the optimal training period length for this particular data set is 20 days , whereas the optimal value of the threshold parameter  @xmath78  of the tn - ln regime - switching combination model equals 8 ms@xmath0 , resulting in the use of an ln distribution in about @xmath79 of the forecast cases .",

    "<S> ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) is a statistical tool for post - processing forecast ensembles of weather variables obtained from multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models in order to produce calibrated predictive probability density functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emos predictive pdf is given by a parametric distribution with parameters depending on the ensemble forecasts . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an emos model for calibrating wind speed forecasts based on weighted mixtures of truncated normal ( tn ) and log - normal ( ln ) distributions where model parameters and component weights are estimated by optimizing the values of proper scoring rules over a rolling training period . </S>",
    "<S> the new model is tested on wind speed forecasts of the 50 member european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ensemble , the 11 member aire limite adaptation dynamique dveloppement international - hungary ensemble prediction system ensemble of the hungarian meteorological service and the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble , and its predictive performance is compared to that of various benchmark emos models based on single parametric families and combinations thereof . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate improved calibration of probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts in comparison with the raw ensemble and climatological forecasts . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture emos model significantly outperforms the tn and ln emos methods , moreover , it provides better calibrated forecasts than the tn - ln combination model and offers an increased flexibility while avoiding covariate selection problems .    </S>",
