    "a geometry lies in the foundation of physics , and a true conception of geometry is very important for the consequent development of physics .",
    "it is common practice to think that all problems in foundations of geometry have been solved many years ago .",
    "it is valid , but this concerns the geometry considered to be a logical construction .",
    "physicists are interested in the geometry considered as a science on mutual disposition of geometrical objects in the space or in the space - time .",
    "the two aspects of geometry are quite different , and one can speak about two different geometries , using for them two different terms .",
    "geometry as a logical construction is a homogeneous geometry , where all points have the same properties .",
    "well known mathematician felix klein @xcite believed that only the homogeneous geometry deserves to be called a geometry .",
    "it is his opinion that the riemannian geometry ( in general , inhomogeneous geometry ) should be qualified as a riemannian geography , or a riemannian topography . in other words",
    ", felix klein considered a geometry mainly as a logical construction .",
    "we shall refer to such a geometry as the mathematical geometry .",
    "the geometry considered to be a science on mutual disposition of geometric objects will be referred to as a physical geometry , because the physicists are interested mainly in this aspect of a geometry .",
    "the physical geometries are inhomogeneous , in general , although they may be homogeneous also . on the one hand ,",
    "the proper euclidean geometry is a physical geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a logical construction , because it is homogeneous and can be constructed of simple elements ( points , straights , planes , etc . ) .",
    "all elements of the euclidean geometry have similar properties , which are described by axioms .",
    "similarity of geometrical elements allows one to construct the mathematical ( homogeneous ) geometry by means of logical reasonings .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry was constructed many years ago by euclid .",
    "consistency of this construction was investigated and proved in @xcite .",
    "such a construction is very complicated even in the case of the proper euclidean geometry , because simple geometrical objects are used for construction of more complicated ones , and one can not construct a complicated geometrical object @xmath5 without construction of more simple constituents of this object .    note that constructing his geometry , euclid did not use coordinates for labeling of the space points .",
    "his description of the homogeneous geometry was coordinateless .",
    "it means that the coordinates are not a necessary attribute of the geometry .",
    "coordinate system is a method of the geometry description , which may or may not be used .",
    "application of coordinates and of other means of description poses the problem of separation of the geometry properties from the properties of the means of the description .",
    "usually the separation of the geometry properties from the coordinate system properties is carried out as follows .",
    "the geometry is described in all possible coordinate systems .",
    "transformations from one coordinate system to the another one form a group of transformation .",
    "invariants of this transformation group are the same in all coordinate system , and hence , they describe properties of the geometry in question .    at this point",
    "we are to make a very important remark .",
    "_ any geometry is a totality of all geometric objects _ @xmath5 _ _  and of all relations _ _ @xmath6 _ _  between them__. any geometric object @xmath5 is a subset of points of some point set @xmath7 , where the geometry is given . in the riemannian geometry ( and in other inhomogeneous geometries )",
    "the set @xmath7 is supposed to be a @xmath8-dimensional manifold , whose points @xmath9 are labelled by @xmath8 coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "this labelling ( arithmetization of space ) is considered to be a necessary attribute of the riemannian geometry .",
    "most geometers believe that the riemannian geometry ( and physical geometry , in general ) can not be constructed without introduction of the manifold . in other words",
    ", they believe that the manifold is an attribute of the riemannian geometry ( and of any continuous geometry , in general ) . this belief is founded on the fact , that the riemannian geometry is always constructed on some manifold .",
    "but this belief is a delusion .",
    "the fact , that we always construct the physical geometry on some manifold , does not mean that the physical geometry can not be constructed without a reference to a manifold , or to a coordinate system .",
    "of course , some labelling of the spatial points ( coordinate system ) is convenient , but this labelling has no relations to the construction of the geometry , and the physical geometry should be constructed without a reference to coordinate system .",
    "application of the coordinate system imposes constraints on properties of the constructed physical geometry .",
    "for instance , if we use a continuous coordinate system ( manifold ) we can construct only continuous physical geometry . to construct a discrete physical geometry ,",
    "the geometry construction is not to contain a reference to the coordinate system .    here",
    "we present the method of the physical geometry construction , which does not contain a reference to the coordinate system and other means of description .",
    "it contains a reference only to the distance function @xmath0 , which is a real characteristic of physical geometry .    if a geometry is inhomogeneous , and the straights located in different places have different properties , it is impossible to describe properties of straights by means of axioms , because there are no such axioms for the whole geometry .",
    "mutual disposition of points in a physical ( inhomogeneous ) geometry , which is given on the set @xmath7 of points @xmath9 , is described by the distance function @xmath11@xmath12 the distance function @xmath0 is the main characteristic of the physical geometry .",
    "besides , the distance function @xmath0 is an _ unique characteristic _ of any physical geometry . _ the distance function _ @xmath0 _ _  determines completely the physical geometry .",
    "_ _ this statement is very important for construction of a physical geometry .",
    "it will be proved below . any physical geometry @xmath3 is constructed from the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 by means of a deformation , i.e. by a replacement of the euclidean distance function @xmath14 by the distance function of the geometry in question .",
    "for instance , constructing the riemannian geometry , we replace the euclidean infinitesimal distance @xmath15 by the riemannian one @xmath16 .",
    "there is no method of the inhomogeneous physical geometry construction other , than the deformation of the euclidean geometry ( or some other homogeneous geometry ) which is constructed as a mathematical geometry on the basis of its axiomatics and logic .",
    "unfortunately , conventional method of the riemannian geometry construction contains a reference to the coordinate system . but this reference can be eliminated , provided that we use finite distances @xmath0 instead of infinitesimal distances @xmath17 .    for description of a physical geometry one uses the world function @xmath4 @xcite , which is connected with the distance function @xmath0 by means of the relation @xmath18 .",
    "the world function @xmath4 of the @xmath4-space @xmath19 is defined by the relation @xmath20 application of the world function is more convenient in the relation that the world function is real , when the distance function @xmath0 is imaginary and does not satisfy definition ( [ b1.1 ] ) .",
    "it is important at the consideration of the space - time geometry as a physical geometry .",
    "in general , a physical geometry can not be constructed as a logical building , because any change of the world function should be accompanied by a change of axiomatics .",
    "this is practically aerial , because the set of possible physical geometries is continual .",
    "does the world function contain full information which is necessary for construction of the physical geometry ? it is a very important question .",
    "for instance , can one derive the space dimension from the world function in the case of euclidean geometry ?",
    "slightly below we shall answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "now we formulate the method of the physical geometry construction .",
    "let us imagine that the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 can be described completely in terms and only in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath2 .",
    "such a description is called @xmath4-immanent .",
    "it means that any geometrical object @xmath21 and any relation @xmath22 between geometrical objects in @xmath13 can be described in terms of @xmath2 in the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to obtain corresponding geometrical object @xmath5 and corresponding relation @xmath6 between the geometrical objects in other physical geometry @xmath3 ,",
    "it is sufficient to replace the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the physical geometry @xmath3 in description of @xmath25 and @xmath24 . @xmath26",
    "index e shows that the geometric object is constructed on the basis of the euclidean axiomatics .",
    "thus , one can obtain another physical geometry @xmath3 from the euclidean geometry @xmath13 by a simple replacement of @xmath2 by @xmath4 .",
    "for such a construction one needs no axiomatics and no reasonings .",
    "one needs no means of descriptions ( topological structures , continuity , coordinate system , manifold , dimension , etc . ) .",
    "in fact , one uses implicitly the axiomatics of the euclidean geometry , which is deformed by the replacement @xmath27 .",
    "this replacement may be interpreted as a deformation of the euclidean space .",
    "absence of a reference to the means of description is an advantage of the considered method of the geometry construction .",
    "besides , there is no necessity to construct the whole geometry @xmath3",
    ". we can construct and investigate only that part of the geometry @xmath3 which we are interested in .",
    "any physical geometry may be constructed as a result of a deformation of the euclidean geometry .",
    "the geometric object @xmath5 is described by means of the skeleton - envelope method @xcite .",
    "it means that any geometric object @xmath5 is considered to be a set of intersections and joins of elementary geometric objects ( ego ) .",
    "the finite set @xmath28 of parameters of the envelope function @xmath29 is the skeleton of elementary geometric object ( ego ) @xmath30 .",
    "the set @xmath31 of points forming ego is called the envelope of its skeleton @xmath32 . for continuous physical geometry",
    "the envelope @xmath33 is usually a continual set of points .",
    "the envelope function @xmath29 , determining ego is a function of the running point @xmath34 and of parameters @xmath35 .",
    "the envelope function @xmath29 is supposed to be an algebraic function of @xmath36 arguments @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "each of arguments @xmath39 is a @xmath4-function of two arguments @xmath40 , either belonging to skeleton @xmath32 , or coinciding with the running point @xmath41 .",
    "thus , any elementary geometric object @xmath33 is determined by its skeleton and its envelope function .",
    "for instance , the sphere @xmath42 with the center at the point @xmath43 is determined by the relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a point belonging to the sphere .",
    "the elementary object @xmath33 is determined in all physical geometries at once .",
    "in particular , it is determined in the proper euclidean geometry , where we can obtain its meaning .",
    "we interpret the elementary geometrical object @xmath33 , using our knowledge of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "thus , the proper euclidean geometry is used as a sample geometry for interpretation of any physical geometry .",
    "we do not try to repeat subscriptions of euclid at construction of the geometry .",
    "we take the geometrical objects and relations between them , prepared in the framework of the euclidean geometry and describe them in terms of the world function .",
    "thereafter we deform them , replacing the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the geometry in question . in practice the construction of the elementary geometry object",
    "is reduced to the representation of the corresponding euclidean geometrical object in the @xmath4-immanent form , i.e. in terms of the euclidean world function .",
    "the last problem is the problem of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "the problem of representation of the geometrical object ( or relation between objects ) in the @xmath4-immanent form is a real problem of the physical geometry construction .",
    "it is very important , that such a construction does not use coordinates and other methods of description , because the application of the means of description imposes constraints on the constructed geometry .",
    "any means of description is a structure @xmath46 given on the basic euclidean geometry with the world function @xmath2 .",
    "replacement @xmath27 is sufficient for construction of unique physical geometry @xmath47 .",
    "if we use an additional structure @xmath46 for construction of physical geometry , we obtain , in general , other geometry @xmath48 , which coincide with @xmath47 not for all @xmath4 , but only for some of world functions @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a use of additional means of description restricts the list of possible physical geometries .",
    "for instance , if we use the coordinate description at construction of the physical geometry , the obtained geometry appears to be continuous , because description by means of the coordinates is effective only for continuous geometries , where the number of coordinates coincides with the geometry dimension .    constructing geometry @xmath3 by vtans of a deformation we use essentially the fact that the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 is a mathematical geometry , which has been constucted on the basis of euclidean axiomatics and logical reasonings .",
    "we shall refer to the described method of the physical geometry construction as the deformation principle and interpret the deformation in the broad sense of the word .",
    "in particular , a deformation of the euclidean space may transform an euclidean surface into a point , and an euclidean point into a surface .",
    "such a deformation may remove some points of the euclidean space , violating its continuity , or decreasing its dimension .",
    "such a deformation may add supplemental points to the euclidean space , increasing its dimension .",
    "in other words , the deformation principle is a very general method of the physical geometry construction .",
    "the deformation principle as a method of the physical geometry construction contains two essential stages :    \\(i ) representation of geometrical objects @xmath5 and relations @xmath6 of the euclidean geometry in the @xmath4-immanent form , i.e. in terms and only in terms of the world function @xmath2 .",
    "\\(ii ) replacement of the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the geometry in question .    a physical geometry , constructed by means of the only deformation principle ( i.e. without a use of other methods of the geometry construction ) is called t - geometry ( tubular geometry ) @xcite .",
    "the t - geometry is the most general kind of the physical geometry .",
    "application of the deformation principle is restricted by two constraints .",
    "\\1 . describing euclidean geometric objects @xmath49 and euclidean relation @xmath50 in terms of @xmath2 , we are not to use special properties of euclidean world function @xmath2 . in particular , definitions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are to have similar form in euclidean geometries of different dimensions .",
    "they must not depend on the dimension of the euclidean space .",
    "the deformation principle is to be applied separately from other methods of the geometry construction . in particular",
    ", one may not use topological structures in construction of a physical geometry , because for effective application of the deformation principle the obtained physical geometry must be determined only by the world function ( metric ) .",
    "the crucial point of the t - geometry construction is the description of the proper euclidean geometry in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath2",
    ". we shall refer to this method of description as the @xmath4-immanent description .",
    "unfortunately , it was unknown for many years , although all physicists knew that the infinitesimal interval @xmath16 is the unique essential characteristic of the space - time geometry , and changing this expression , we change the space - time geometry . from physical viewpoint",
    "the @xmath4-immanent description is very reasonable , because it does not contain any extrinsic information .",
    "the @xmath4-immanent description does not refer to the means of description ( dimension , manifold , coordinate system ) .",
    "absence of references to means of description is important in the relation , that there is no necessity to separate the information on the geometry in itself from the information on the means of description .",
    "the @xmath4-immanent description contains only essential characteristic of geometry : its world function . at first",
    "the @xmath4-immanent description was obtained in 1990 @xcite .",
    "the first question concerning the @xmath4-immanent description is as follows .",
    "does the world function contain sufficient information for description of a physical geometry ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , at least , in the case of the proper euclidean geometry , and this answer is given by the prove of the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath4-space @xmath51 be a set @xmath7 of points @xmath9 with the given world function @xmath4@xmath52 let the vector @xmath53 be the ordered set of two points @xmath43 , @xmath45 , and its length @xmath54 is defined by the relation @xmath55 .",
    "_ theorem _    the @xmath4-space @xmath51 is the @xmath8-dimensional proper euclidean space , if and only if the world function @xmath4 satisfies the following conditions , written in terms of the world function @xmath4 .    i. condition of symmetry : @xmath56    \\ii . definition of the dimension : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gram s determinant @xmath59 the scalar product @xmath60 of two vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 is defined by the relation @xmath63 vectors @xmath64 , @xmath65 are basic vectors of the rectilinear coordinate system @xmath66 with the origin at the point @xmath67 , and the metric tensors @xmath68 , @xmath69 ,  @xmath70 in @xmath66 are defined by the relations @xmath71",

    "v contain a reference to the dimension @xmath8 of the euclidean space .",
    "as far as the @xmath4-immanent description of the proper euclidean geometry is possible , it is possible for any t - geometry , because any geometrical object @xmath5 and any relation @xmath6 in the physical geometry @xmath3 is obtained from the corresponding geometrical object @xmath21 and from the corresponding relation @xmath22 in the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 by means of the replacement @xmath27 in description of @xmath21 an @xmath22 .",
    "for such a replacement be possible , the description of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is not to refer to special properties of @xmath2 , described by conditions ii  v. a formal indicator of the conditions ii  v application is a reference to the dimension @xmath8 , because any of conditions ii  v contains a reference to the dimension @xmath8 of the proper euclidean space .",
    "if nevertheless we use one of special properties ii  v of the euclidean space in the @xmath4-immanent description of a geometrical object @xmath5 , or relation @xmath6 , we refer to the dimension @xmath8 and , ultimately , to the coordinate system , which is only a means of description .",
    "let us show this in the example of the determination of the straight in the @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the straight @xmath81 in the proper euclidean space is defined by two its points @xmath43 and @xmath82 @xmath83 as the set of points @xmath41 @xmath84 where condition @xmath85 means that vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are collinear , i.e. the scalar product @xmath88 of these two vectors satisfies the relation @xmath89 where the scalar product is defined by the relation ( [ b11a ] ) .",
    "thus , the straight line @xmath81 is defined @xmath4-immanently , i.e. in terms of the world function @xmath4 .",
    "we shall use two different names ( straight and tube ) for the geometric object @xmath81 .",
    "we shall use the term  straight  , when we want to stress that @xmath81 is a result of deformation of the euclidean straight .",
    "we shall use the term  tube  , when we want to stress that @xmath81 may be a many - dimensional surface .    in the euclidean geometry one can use another definition of collinearity .",
    "vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are collinear , if components of vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 in some coordinate system are proportional .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space one can introduce rectangular coordinate system , choosing @xmath90 points @xmath91 and forming @xmath8 basic vectors @xmath64 , @xmath74 .",
    "then the collinearity condition can be written in the form of @xmath8 equations @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some constant",
    ". relations ( [ b17 ] ) are relations for covariant components of vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the considered coordinate system with basic vectors @xmath64 , @xmath74 .",
    "let points @xmath32 be chosen in such a way , that @xmath94 . then eliminating the parameter @xmath93 from relations ( [ b17 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 independent relations , and the geometrical object @xmath96 defined according to ( [ b17 ] ) , depends on @xmath97 points @xmath98 . this geometrical object @xmath99",
    "is defined @xmath4-immanently .",
    "it is a complex , consisting of the straight line and the coordinate system , represented by @xmath90 points @xmath91 . in the euclidean space",
    "the dependence on the choice of the coordinate system and on @xmath90 points @xmath32 determining this system , is fictitious .",
    "the geometrical object @xmath99 depends only on two points @xmath100 and coincides with the straight line @xmath81 .",
    "but at deformations of the euclidean space the geometrical objects @xmath99 and @xmath81 are deformed differently .",
    "the points @xmath101 cease to be fictitious in definition of @xmath99 , and geometrical objects @xmath99 and @xmath81 become to be different geometric objects , in general . but being different , in general , they may coincide in some special cases .    what of the two geometrical objects in the deformed geometry should be interpreted as the straight line , passing through the points @xmath43 and @xmath82 in the geometry @xmath3 ?",
    "of course , it is @xmath81 , because its definition does not contain a reference to a coordinate system , whereas definition of @xmath99 depends on the choice of the coordinate system , represented by points @xmath32 . in general ,",
    "definitions of geometric objects and relations between them are not to refer to the means of description .",

    "the one - dimensional curve @xmath99 corresponds better to our ideas on the straight line , than the @xmath102-dimensional surface @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , in physical geometry @xmath3 it is @xmath81 , that is an analog of the euclidean straight line .",
    "it is very difficult to overcome our conventional idea that the euclidean straight line can not be deformed into many - dimensional surface , and _ this idea has been prevent for years from construction of t - geometries_. practically one uses such physical geometries , where deformation of the euclidean space transforms the euclidean straight lines into one - dimensional lines .",

    "however it is not so , because the metric geometry does not use the deformation principle .",
    "the fact , that the euclidean geometry can be described @xmath4-immanently , as well as the conditions ( [ b10 ] ) - ( [ b14 ] ) , were not known until 1990 .",

    "the fact is that , in the metric geometry the shortest ( straight ) line can be constructed only in the case , when it is one - dimensional .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath110 of points @xmath41 @xmath111 if the metric space coincides with the proper euclidean space , this set of points is an ellipsoid with focuses at the points @xmath112 and the large semiaxis @xmath93 .",

    "all these objects as well as other are constructed on the basis of the deformation of the proper euclidean geometry .",

    "riemannian geometries satisfy the condition ( [ b19 ] ) .",
    "the riemannian geometry is a kind of inhomogeneous physical geometry , and , hence , it uses the deformation principle . constructing the riemannian geometry ,",

    "but the riemannian geometries are not t - geometries , because at their construction one uses not only the deformation principle , but some other methods , containing a reference to the means of description . in particular , in the riemannian geometries the absolute parallelism is absent , and one can not to define a straight line ( [ b3.0 ] ) , because the relation @xmath125 is not defined , if points @xmath43 and @xmath124 do not coincide .",
    "on one hand , a lack of absolute parallelism allows one to go around the problem of non - one - dimensional straight lines . on the other hand",
    ", it makes the riemannian geometries to be inconsistent , because they cease to be t - geometries , which are consistent by the construction ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "the fact is that the application of _ only deformation principle _ is sufficient for construction of a physical geometry .",
    "besides , such a construction is consistent , because the original euclidean geometry is consistent and , deforming it , we do not use any reasonings .",
    "if we introduce additional structure ( for instance , a topological structure ) we obtain a fortified physical geometry , i.e. a physical geometry with additional structure on it . the physical geometry with additional structure on it is a more pithy construction , than the physical geometry simply .",

    "if we demand that the additional structure to be a structure of physical geometry , we restrict an application of the deformation principle and reduce the list of possible physical geometries , because coincidence of the additional structure with some structure of a physical geometry is possible not for all physical geometries , but only for some of them .",

    "a use of the mapping ( [ a1.1 ] ) needs an introduction of topological space and , in particular , the concept of continuity .",
    "if we identify the topological curve ( [ a1.1 ] ) with the  metrical  curve , defined as a broken line @xmath126 } , \\qquad \\mathcal{t}_{\\left [ p_{i}p_{i+1}\\right ] } = \\left\\ { r|\\sqrt{2\\sigma \\left ( p_{i},p_{i+1}\\right ) } -\\sqrt{2\\sigma \\left ( p_{i},r\\right ) } -\\sqrt{2\\sigma \\left ( r , p_{i+1}\\right ) } \\right\\ }   \\label{a1.2}\\ ] ] consisting of the straight line segments @xmath127 } $ ] between the points @xmath128 , @xmath129 , we truncate the list of possible geometries , because such an identification is possible only in some physical geometries . identifying ( [ a1.1 ] ) and ( [ a1.2 ] ) , we eliminate all discrete physical geometries and those continuous physical geometries , where the segment @xmath127 } $ ] of straight line is a surface , but not a one - dimensional set of points .",

    "the result depends on the method of the additional structure application .",
    "note that some constraints ( continuity , convexity , lack of absolute parallelism ) , imposed on physical geometries are a result of a disagreement of the applied means of the geometry construction .",
    "in the t - geometry , which uses only the deformation principle , there is no such restrictions .",
    "besides , the t - geometry accepts some new property of a physical geometry , which is not accepted by conventional versions of physical geometry .",
    "this property , called the geometry nondegeneracy , follows directly from the application of arbitrary deformations to the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "the geometry is degenerate at the point @xmath43 in the direction of the vector @xmath130 , @xmath131 , if the relations @xmath132 considered as equations for determination of the point @xmath41 , have not more , than one solution for any @xmath133 .",

    "dependence of the definition ( [ b3.1a ] ) on the points @xmath140 is fictitious , but dependence on the number @xmath90 of points @xmath32 is essential .",
    "thus , definition ( [ b3.1a ] ) depends on the method of the geometry description .",
    "the minkowski t - geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all timelike vectors , and it is nondegenerate at all points in direction of all spacelike vectors .",

    "practically one uses the deformation principle , although it is not mentioned in all definitions .    let us consider a simple example of the space - time geometry @xmath148 , described by the t - geometry on 4-dimensional manifold @xmath149 . the world function @xmath150 is described by the relation @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are some constants .",

    "let us compare the broken line ( [ a1.2 ] ) in minkowski space - time geometry @xmath155 and in the distorted geometry @xmath148 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath159 is timelike broken line , and all links @xmath127 } $ ] of @xmath159 are timelike and have the same length @xmath160 @xmath161 where indices  d  and  m  mean that the quantity is calculated by means of @xmath150 and @xmath162 respectively .",
    "vector @xmath163 is regarded as the momentum of the particle at the segment @xmath127 } $ ] , and the quantity @xmath164 is interpreted as its ( geometric ) mass .",
    "it follows from definition ( [ b11a ] ) and relation ( [ b3.3 ] ) , that for timelike vectors @xmath163 with @xmath165@xmath166 @xmath167 calculation of the shape of the segment @xmath147 } \\left ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm{d}}\\right ) $ ] in @xmath148 gives the relation @xmath168 , & 1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2(\\sigma _ { 0}+d)}}{\\mu _ { \\mathrm{d}}}<\\tau < 1 \\end{array } \\right . ,   \\label{b3.7a}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 is the spatial radius of the segment @xmath147 } \\left ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm{d}}\\right ) $ ] in the coordinate system , where points @xmath43 and @xmath45 have coordinates @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 is a parameter along the segment @xmath147 } \\left ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm{d}}\\right ) $ ] ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) .",
    "one can see from ( [ b3.7a ] ) that the characteristic value of the segment radius is @xmath175 .",
    "let the broken tube @xmath159 describe the  world line  of a free particle .",
    "it means by definition that any link @xmath176 is parallel to the adjacent link @xmath163@xmath177 definition of parallelism is different in geometries @xmath155 and @xmath148 . as a result links , which are parallel in the geometry @xmath155 , are not parallel in @xmath148 and vice versa .",

    "it means , that the adjacent link is located on the cone of angle @xmath191 , and the whole line @xmath182 has a random shape , because any link wabbles with the characteristic angle @xmath192 .",
    "the wabble angle depends on the space - time distortion @xmath0 and on the particle mass @xmath193 .",
    "the wabble angle is small for the large mass of a particle .",
    "the random displacement of the segment end is of the order @xmath194 , i.e. of the same order as the segment width .",
    "it is reasonable , because these two phenomena have the common source : the space - time distortion @xmath195 .",
    "one should note that the space - time geometry influences the stochasticity of particle motion nonlocally in the sense , that the form of the world function ( [ b3.3 ] ) for values of @xmath196 is unessential for the motion stochasticity of the particle of the mass @xmath193 .",
    "such a situation , when the world line of a free particle is stochastic in the deterministic geometry , and this stochasticity depends on the particle mass , seems to be rather exotic and incredible . but experiments show that the motion of real particles of small mass is stochastic indeed , and this stochasticity increases , when the particle mass decreases . from physical viewpoint a theoretical foundation of the stochasticity is desirable , and some researchers invent stochastic geometries , noncommutative geometries and other exotic geometrical constructions , to obtain the quantum stochasticity . but in the riemannian space - time geometry the particle motion does not depend on the particle mass , and in the framework of the riemannian space - time geometry it is difficult to explain the quantum stochasticity by the space - time geometry properties .",
    "distorted geometry @xmath148 explains the stochasticity and its dependence on the particle mass freely . besides , at proper choice of the distortion @xmath0 the statistical description of stochastic",
    "@xmath159 leads to the quantum description ( schrdinger equation ) @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to set @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the quantum constant , @xmath158 is the speed of the light , and @xmath199 is some universal constant , connecting the geometrical mass @xmath200 with the usual particle mass @xmath201 by means of the relation @xmath202 . in other words , the distorted space - time geometry ( [ b3.3 ] ) is closer to the real space - time geometry , than the minkowski geometry @xmath155 .",
    "further development of the statistical description of geometrical stochasticity leads to a creation of the model conception of quantum phenomena ( mcqp ) , which relates to the conventional quantum theory approximately in the same way as the statistical physics relates to the axiomatic thermodynamics .",
    "mcqp is the well defined relativistic conception with effective methods of investigation @xcite , whereas the conventional quantum theory is not well defined , because it uses incorrect space - time geometry , whose incorrectness is compensated by additional hypotheses ( quantum principles ) . besides , it has problems with application of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical technique to the description of relativistic phenomena .",
    "the geometry @xmath148 is a homogeneous geometry as well as the minkowski geometry , because the world function @xmath150 is invariant with respect to all coordinate transformations , with respect to which the world function @xmath162 is invariant . in this connection",
    "the question arises , whether one could invent some axiomatics for @xmath148 and derive the geometry @xmath148 from this axiomatics by means of proper reasonings .",
    "note that such an axiomatics is to depend on the parameter @xmath0 , because the world function @xmath150 depends on this parameter . if @xmath203 , this axiomatics is to coincide with the axiomatics of the minkowski geometry @xmath155 .",
    "if @xmath204 , this axiomatics can not coincide with the axiomatics of @xmath155 , because some axioms of @xmath155 are not satisfied in this case .",
    "in general , the invention of axiomatics , depending on the parameter @xmath0 and in the general case on the distortion function @xmath195 , seems to be a very difficult problem . besides",
    ", why invent the axiomatics ?",
    "we had derived the axiomatics for the proper euclidean geometry , when we constructed it before .",
    "there is no necessity to repeat this process any time , when we construct a new geometry .",
    "it is sufficient to apply the deformation principle to the constructed euclidean geometry written @xmath4-immanently .",
    "application of the deformation principle to the euclidean geometry is a very simple and very general procedue , which is not restricted by continuity , convexity and other artificial constraints , generated by our preconceived approach to the physical geometry .",
    "( bias of the approach is displayed in the antecedent supposition on the one - dimensionality of any straight line in any physical geometry ) .",
    "thus , we have seen that the nondegeneracy of the physical geometry as well as non - one - dimensionality of the straight line are properties of the real physical geometries .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry is a ground for all physical geometries , and it is a degenerate geometry .",
    "nevertheless , it is beyond reason to deny an existence of nondegenerate physical geometries .      1",
