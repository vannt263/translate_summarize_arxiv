    "the standard cosmological model successfully describes a wide range of observational phenomena using just six parameters in the context of a framework that requires only a handful of basic assumptions @xcite .",

    ", one can gauge the maturity of the field through the fact that activity switches from establishing the validity of the framework to searching for physics ` beyond the standard model ' .",
    "the most precise cosmological data come from careful measurements of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb @xcite ) , as surveyed by the _",

    "( e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite ) there has been intensive investigation into deviations from gaussianity or the breaking of statistical isotropy on large scales , motivated by the fact that they could be smoking guns for new physics in the early universe .",
    "this process has continued to the present day , with a huge number of studies searching for blemishes of various forms in the cmb sky , which might be evidence for chinks in the armour of the standard model @xcite .",
    "now it seems like this search has become the main industry in cosmology .",
    "hundreds of papers have been written on this topic .",
    "we can not possibly refer to all of them here , but many can be found in the reference lists of several overviews of the subject @xcite . in the cmb sky ,",
    "such deviations from perfection are often referred to as ` anomalies ' , and there are several distinct features of this sort that have been identified .",
    "sarkar et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that there are at least two unrelated kinds of anomalies and hence one can take the product of the chance probabilities to determine how unlikely our observed universe is in the standard model .",
    "recently schwarz et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that there are at least _ three _ distinct kinds of anomaly , and since each of them separately has a probability of @xmath2 in the standard model , then our cmb sky is unlikely at the roughly 1-in - a - million level .",
    "similar conclusions were also made in another recent paper by melia @xcite .",
    "in fact considerably more than three kinds of anomaly have already been identified , and no doubt more remain to be uncovered .",
    "they include : the cold spot ; the low-@xmath3 deficit ; the @xmath430 dip ; hemispheric asymmetry ; low variance ; dipole modulation ; odd / even multipole asymmetry ; and other specific features , such as rings , stripes , wiggles , bites and even letters @xcite .",
    "when considered together , the combined probability is vanishingly small that our sky could be a realisation of a gaussian random process within @xmath1cdm .",
    "amazing though these cmb features are , we have discovered that a much more familiar data set , namely the digits of @xmath0 @xcite , contains equally astonishing anomalies . through the use of advanced analysis methods , using pattern recognition software and bayesian search algorithms , we have discovered many distinct features in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , for each cmb anomaly there appears to be a corresponding effect in the digits of @xmath0  we call these analogous anisotropy anomalies ( or aaas )",
    ". these features in @xmath0 are _ at least _ as significant as the cosmological ones , and given that the cmb anomalies are patently evidence for new physics , this means that the patterns in @xmath0 must demonstrate the existence of _ mathematics _ beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the irrational number @xmath0 @xcite occurs throughout physics , in anything related to rotations , waves , vibrations or phases .",
    "it occurs explicitly in coulomb s law , kepler s third law , einstein s field equations , the fourier transform , the normalization of a gaussian , the reduced planck constant , etc .",
    "and perhaps most astonishingly , if you divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter , you get exactly @xmath0 !    unlike other numbers , @xmath0 attracts enormous attention , with contests to memorise its digits @xcite , and it even has its own day @xcite . the number has also inspired a style of writing called ` pilish ' ( whose origin has been attributed to sir james jeans @xcite ) , in which one uses words whose lengths match sequentially to the digits of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore it is known that the digits of @xmath0 eventually have to contain messages , and there is speculation that these may reveal basic truths about the nature of reality @xcite .    by developing novel computational techniques",
    ", we have performed extensive searches for patterns in the digits of @xmath0 , similar to those already carried out for the cmb sky . for definiteness , in most of the investigations that we describe below , we focus on the first 10,000 digits of @xmath0 @xcite , since this is similar to the number of modes probed by today s cmb mapping experiments .",
    "we leave it to other researchers to extend our study to the trillions of additional digits that are now known . like the cmb sky @xcite",
    ", we also assume that the digits of @xmath0 are unchanging , although previous studies have already been carried out to investigate possible temporal @xcite or spatial @xcite variations of @xmath0 .",
    "let us begin with one of the most widely discussed features in the cmb sky , namely the ` cold spot ' .",
    "despite the fact that the power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies carries around @xmath6 worth of information @xcite , the apparently 23@xmath7 significance of the cold spot is fantastically important . a quick glance at fig .  [ fig : nocoldspot](a ) shows just how prominent this feature is on the sky . although not the large blue region near the centre @xcite , and not actually the coldest place on the cmb sky @xcite , the chances of finding a cold region of exactly this size and shape in gaussian random skies is quite small . and",
    "the chances of finding such a spot in precisely this direction is almost vanishingly small .    in the digits of @xmath0",
    "there is an analogous feature , which might be called a ` hot spot ' , since it involves a cluster of the number ` 9 ' . specifically , ` 9 ' occurs six times concurrently after the 762nd digit of @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nocoldspot](b ) .",
    "this is sometimes called the ` feynman point ' @xcite , and appears fantastically earlier in the digits of @xmath0 than one would expect for such a repeated run .",
    "one can estimate the probability of this aaa in the following way : the number of possible outcomes for 762 digits is @xmath8 ; the number of places the run ` 999999 ' could be located within the first 762 digits is @xmath9 and the number of possibilities for the other 756 digits is @xmath10 ; and hence the probability is @xmath11 .    it has also been pointed out @xcite that the digits of @xmath12 contain _ seven _ consecutive 9s at about the same position as the six 9s in @xmath0 .",
    "this is of course even less likely to occur by chance .",
    "there are many other examples of unlikely runs of digits within @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for example , if we focus on the number ` 4 ' , we find that the sequence ` 4444 ' occurs much _ later _ than expected ( in fact it is the last of the sets of four identical numbers ) , not until digit 54525 . and amazingly ` 44444 ' is also the last sequence of its type to occur ( i.e.  after ` 00000 ' , ` 11111 ' , etc . ) , not until digit 808651 .",
    "this of course leads us to ask what is special about 4 and about 9  what previously hidden mathematical principle could explain this behaviour ?",
    "the large - scale cmb sky has lower variance than expected , and this can be examined in several different ways , e.g.  by estimating the variance of the temperature field or some filtered power spectrum estimator .",
    "one popular statistical approach is to examine the correlation function of the cmb , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowvariance](a )",
    ". it is very noticeable that above a precisely defined scale ( say about @xmath13 ) the correlation function is very nearly approximately zero . and the chances of this are surely tiny .",
    "this result is so dramatic that the universe is clearly trying to tell us something  perhaps there is an anthropic connection between the lack of large - scale correlations and our existence ?",
    "this deficiency in the variance at low multipoles has an analogy in the behaviour of the early digits of @xmath0 . in the first 100 digits ,",
    "the numbers 0 to 9 all occur fairly close to the average number of times ( which is 10 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowvariance](b ) .",
    "the biggest deviation is for the number 9 , which occurs 13 times , this being exactly @xmath14 from the mean , with no other number occurring with a frequency that is more than @xmath14 from the expectation .",
    "this therefore represents a very ` quiet ' distribution . using poisson statistics ,",
    "the chances of picking 100 random digits and finding one digit more than 13 times is 0.220 and the chances of finding it less than 8 times is 0.136 ; hence for each of the 10 digits we have @xmath15 and then the total probability of having such a quiet distribution is @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that the early digits of @xmath0 are already telling us something through the fact that none of these integers wants to stand out .",
    "in fact there are indications that this low variance continues further , and we can determine that the expected number for @xmath17 digits is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , and the variance is @xmath20 . in the first 1,000 digits only one number ( ` 1 ' in this case ) occurs more than @xmath14 from the expected frequency , and a similar pattern is even seen out to 10,000,000 digits , where ` 4 ' is the only number occurring more than @xmath14 from the expected fraction .      another often - discussed anomaly is the lack of power in the @xmath21s at low multipoles .",
    "this manifests itself as a general lowering of power for multipoles below about 40 and a specific ` dip ' that is noticed at @xmath2230 .",
    "such features would be buried at the lowest multipoles if we were to plot @xmath21 versus linear @xmath3 , but can easily be seen when we carefully plot the lowest multipoles on a logarithmic scale , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nodip](a ) .",
    "this low-@xmath3 dip has a corresponding aaa in the digits of @xmath0 , manifesting itself in the lack of the number ` 0 ' .",
    "[ fig : nodip](b ) shows the cumulative count of 0 in the digits of @xmath0 . for the lowest digits",
    "there is an obvious lack of 0s .",
    "in fact the first 0 does not occur until the 33rd digit , the probability of which can easily be estimated to be a few percent .",
    "hence this is interesting , but perhaps not very remarkable in itself .",
    "however , we find that consecutive strings of the number 0 are also under - represented .",
    "for example the pattern ` 000000 ' is the only string of six consecutive numbers that does _ not _ occur in the first million digits of @xmath0 ; in fact it does not show up until digit 1,699,927 .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the binary digits of @xmath0 we discover that there are _ many more _ instances of 0 than 1 for the lowest digits .",
    "in particular 61% of the first 164 bits are 0 , which is extreme enough to have a probability of just 0.3% ( using the binomial distribution for 164 trials ) .",
    "the fraction of occurrences of ` 0 ' stays well above 50% for several hundred more bits , showing that the binary digits also exhibit non - random features that require an explanation .",
    "many studies have pointed out that the cmb sky can be split into two hemispheres in which there is a dramatic difference in the power between each half of the sky .",
    "this can be studied equivalently by determining the amplitude of the dipole modulation of the sky . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hemisphere](a ) we reproduce a plot of the probability of obtaining the observed dipole amplitude in simulations of gaussian skies ( plotted here for each of the four distinct foreground - separated cmb maps produced by the _ planck _ team , but these differences are not relevant here ) .",
    "it is clear that the scale @xmath23 is quite special , and yields a low probability of about @xmath24 .",
    "we can examine an analogous statistic in the digits of @xmath0 .",
    "to do so we consider the digits up to some maximum digit , and split them into the first half and the second half . by removing the average ( i.e.  the value 4.5 for the set of integers 0 to 9 )",
    ", we calculate the sum of the two separate halves of the digits , and plot this against the maximum digit in fig .",
    "[ fig : hemisphere](b ) .",
    "the two halves of the digits of @xmath0 behave in a dramatically different way , with an index around 2700 being the preferred scale here , but the difference continuing out to the highest digits examined .",
    "this aaa thus demonstrates that the digits of @xmath0 have the same sort of ` lop - sidedness ' as the cmb sky .",
    "obviously the lowest - order cmb multipoles are special , and so should be examined particularly closely .",
    "it has been noticed that there is an ` axis of evil ' @xcite , in that the preferred directions of these lowest multipoles are dramatically lined up with each other @xcite .",
    "the extraordinarily tight alignment of the axes of the dipole , quadrupole and octupole are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment](a ) .",
    "this has been estimated to have a probability of order 0.1% .",
    "we can search for an aaa alignment @xcite in @xmath0 itself , but in order to have something to align it with we need to find another number .",
    "the obvious choice is ` e ' , which occurs in physics and mathematics almost as often as @xmath0 .",
    "indeed both numbers occur in the famous euler identity @xmath25",
    ". this may be the most compact and meaningful mathematical expression found by humanity so far @xcite , since it includes the operations of subtraction , multiplication and exponentiation , as well as the numbers @xmath26 , 1 and 0 @xcite , in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "another reason to combine @xmath27 with @xmath0 is the obvious significance of these two numbers for humans , since the number of pairs of chromosomes possessed by homo sapiens is 23 @xcite , and this is the integer bracketed by @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .    when we compare @xmath0 and @xmath27 digit by digit , we find that there are systematically fewer matches than expected . in the first 130 or so",
    "digits there are quite a few matches ( e.g.  in the 13th , 17th and 18th digits ) , occurring at a little more than the expect rate of 1 time in 10 . however , after the 130th digit",
    "the fraction of matches is consistently low all the way out to the 10,000th digit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment](b ) .",
    "one can estimate the significance of this result , e.g.  using a kolmogorov - smirnov test on the deviation , yielding a probability corresponding to approximately a @xmath30 effect .",
    "this is a remarkable result , showing that although @xmath27 and @xmath0 _ should _ be composed of random digits , and hence entirely uncorrelated , they are in fact _ anti_-correlated .",
    "there are two obvious possibilities : this relationship could come from a subtle connection through the euler identity ; or , more fundamentally , it could be pointing to these digits being far from random , but actually contain meaningful patterns @xcite .",
    "another effect seen in the cmb power spectrum is that odd multipoles are systematically higher than even multipoles , a property sometimes referred to as ` point - parity asymmetry ' .",
    "this can be seen in the _ planck _ data plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nosawtooth](a ) , where there is a very striking ` sawtooth ' pattern for odd versus even multipoles .",
    "there is an analogy when we compare the odd and even digits of @xmath0 . if we take the first digits of @xmath0 and split them into pairs , we find that the first digit is sometimes bigger than the second one in the pair , but sometimes the opposite is true . for example in @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but @xmath34 . however , if we repeat this exercise , then more often than not we find that the odd digits are larger than the even digits .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nosawtooth](b ) , where we have plotted the sum of the difference between odd digits and even digits of @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of achieving such a systematic difference over so many pairs of digits is exceedingly small .",
    "one lesson here is that the odd digits of @xmath0 are generally bigger than the even digits , and hence if you wanted , as a party trick , to learn _ either _ the odd digits or even digits of @xmath0 , you would be better to pick the odd digits @xcite .",
    "but what could this ` parity ' aaa be telling us ?",
    "it was pointed out by the _ wmap _ team @xcite that one can find stephen hawking s initials in the cmb sky , as shown in fig .  [ fig : initials](a ) .",
    "these same features , clearly being two roman characters in roughly the same size , font and orientation , are also present in the _ planck _ data .",
    "we are not aware of any systematic search for all combinations of letters , with arbitrary position , font , size and orientation .",
    "but presumably such a search would turn up many other interesting examples of writing on the ` cosmic billboard ' .",
    "words can also be searched for in the digits of @xmath0 . in order to do",
    "that one needs to select a scheme for converting the digits into letters .",
    "we are aware of four separate methods to do this .",
    "firstly one could write the digits of @xmath0 in base 36 , so that after ` 0 , 1 ,  9 ' we have ` a , b , c ,  ' , including the whole of the alphabet .",
    "secondly one could just take base 26 and map it on to the alphabet ( or base 27 , to include a space ) @xcite ; using this method we find that the word ` odd ' occurs considerably more often than the word ` even ' , which is just like the cmb point - parity asymmetry .",
    "thirdly one could determine @xmath0 in binary and then use groups of five binary digits to map to the alphabet ( plus a few punctuation marks ) @xcite ; in this scheme in fact the word ` anomaly ' appears at binary digit 1,769,000,467 .",
    "lastly one can use the more complicated transformation that we adopted to generate fig .",
    "[ fig : initials](b )",
    ".    one sees in this figure that it is possible to find much more noteworthy patterns than the mere pair of initials found in the cmb sky .",
    "for example , across the top of the plot we can just about discern the middle initial for ` s.h . ' and the right - hand half of the figure contains several aligned multipoles . for readers interested in further studying this",
    "` word search ' diagram , we have provided details of our own investigations in an appendix .",
    "it is obvious that for this aaa , it is relatively easy to find features in the digits of @xmath0 that are substantially more anomalous than what we see in the cmb .",
    "the cmb sky contains a combination of several independent anomalies , with a joint probability that makes what we observe extremely unlikely in the standard model , hence indicating evidence for several kinds of new physics .",
    "but perhaps even more amazingly , there are similar kinds of feature in the digits of @xmath0 and these are every bit as significant .",
    "the large - scale cmb sky presents a fixed pattern to us , and hence if one finds anomalies in this pattern , there is no more sky to use to confirm or improve the significance of what was initially found .",
    "the situation with the digits of @xmath0 is analogous , since any anomalies discovered can not be corroborated by performing experiments on these fixed digits @xcite .    some have argued that such features in the digits of @xmath0 need to be considered in the light of a posteriori statistics , or in other words that one should consider the multiplicity of other tests that could have been carried out , to marginalise over similar features that _ might _ have been found , using what is sometimes called the ` look - elsewhere effect ' @xcite .",
    "others have argued that we should look elsewhere for an explanation , that resorting to such statistical sleight - of - hand is the last bastion of scoundrels , because it can be used to torpedo _ any _ apparently @xmath35 effect @xcite .",
    "be that as it may , this issue about overestimating the statistical significance of the anomalies @xcite surely can not apply to the many dramatic features seen on the large - scale cmb sky .",
    "and hence we must also accept the importance of all the structures that also exist within the digits of @xmath0 .",
    "what could these aberrations be telling us ? and",
    "how are they related to other apparent coincidences @xcite in nature ?",
    "if we are seeing anomalies in the decimal digits of @xmath0 , then presumably there is something special about base 10 .",
    "and hence we are indeed created in the image of the creator of not only the entire physical universe , but also the reality of mathematics .",
    "probably there is an anthropic argument that we could only exist in a reality in which mathematics and physics contain these signatures .",
    "no doubt further study of these joint anomalies will give us insight into other dimensions and universes that are otherwise unobservable .",
    "indeed the ` pi theorem ' of buckingham @xcite is a constraint on the number of dimensions within physics .",
    "can we conceive of @xmath0 being different in these other dimensions ? and does this teach us about the nature of the relationship between physics , mathematics and theology @xcite ?",
    "another connection is that the cmb temperature was once equal to @xmath36k , and that epoch corresponded to a redshift of @xmath37 , about 2billion years in the past @xcite  did something happen on earth around this time that connected the development of life with the background radiation and the digits of @xmath0 ?    as a final remark , we add this utilitarian view ",
    "if the aaas mean that the cmb information is somehow _ already _ encoded in @xmath0 , then perhaps in future we can avoid all the fuss and bother of building real cmb experiments , minimising systematic effects while operating them , painstakingly analysing the data , and debating the statistical interpretation of the results  and instead simply look more carefully at the digits of @xmath0 , or in any other random string of digits @xcite .",
