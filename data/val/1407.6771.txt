    "the discoord algorithms proposed in @xcite seek to solve a problem that is described in fig .",
    "[ energy_network ] .",
    "the system of interest is composed of nodes distributed in space , communication network , and physical energy network .",
    "the nodes can generate a certain amount of energy within the node , while it has an initial energy in a certain level , @xmath0 .",
    "the nodes also have some desired levels of energy , @xmath1 .",
    "the nodes are connected through communication layer as well as through physical energy layer . through the communication layer",
    ", they can exchange information about the status of individual node . through the physical layer",
    ", the energy flows from a node to another node , @xmath2 .",
    "the energy flow is called energy distribution .",
    "the main purpose of discoord algorithms is to generate and distribute energies in an attempt to make each node to achieve the desired energy . here ,",
    "as the key constraints , there are the lower and upper levels in the generation of energy ; also all the decision is made only through local interactions between neighboring nodes .",
    "this paper provides case studies taking account of various scenarios ; while analyzing the simulation results , we will discuss the capability of the discoord algorithms .",
    "in discoord algorithms , there are @xmath3 nodes , and each node is able to generate energy within some specified lower and upper boundaries .",
    "the nodes are interconnected for energy exchanges and for communications each other . to make the problem clear , the following symbols are provided .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      the combination of the set of nodes and set of edges is called a graph , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the overall topology of the system is defined by the graph @xmath5 .",
    "the discoord algorithms seek to solve the following problem @xcite .",
    "[ prob1 ] given initial and desired energies of each nodes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , generate energies @xmath6 and exchange energies , @xmath7 , with neighboring nodes such that @xmath8 , by relying upon only local interactions .    in the above problem ,",
    "the energy generation should be done with the constraints of @xmath9    for the energy generation , the node @xmath10 can exchange a certain type of information only with its neighboring nodes .",
    "it is supposed that the information is exchanged through communication layer network ( or cyber - layer network ) @xcite .",
    "the energy exchange means the energy flow between the neighboring nodes ; so the energy exchange is done in physical - layer network .",
    "it is also important to notice that there is a relationship between the desired energies and initial and generated energies .",
    "that is , the sum of the desired energies should be less than the sum of initial energies and the maximum energy that can be generated by the nodes .",
    "it can be constrained as follows : @xmath11    eventually , the discoord algorithms should generate the energies @xmath12 such as @xmath13 which is called the supply - demand balance .",
    "so , given the desired energies of individual nodes , one of the key constraints in the discoord algorithms is to satisfy the supply - demand balance during the generations of @xmath12 .",
    "the purpose of energy generation is to generate @xmath12 only using local neighboring interactions under the constraints of ( [ generation_constraint ] ) and ( [ supply_demand_balance ] ) .",
    "the algorithm is composed of three steps . in the following algorithm ,",
    "the interim parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used .    1",

    "@xmath24    note that in the above @xmath25nd step , for the update of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the node @xmath10 needs information of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are the values of neighboring interim parameters .",
    "so , to compute @xmath6 at the node @xmath10 , it needs to communicate with the neighboring nodes .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath30 are fixed and can be exchanged by initial local interactions , it is simply assumed that they are available to neighboring nodes .",
    "the purpose of the energy distribution is to make the level of energy of each node become @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath31 by the energy flows @xmath7 . this algorithm is also composed of three steps . in the following algorithm , the interim parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are used .    1",

    "@xmath42    note that in the above @xmath25nd step , for the update of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the node @xmath10 needs information of @xmath45 from the neighboring nodes .",
    "since @xmath46 are fixed and can be also exchanged by local interactions initially , it is assumed that they are available to neighboring nodes .",
    "the convergence of algorithms has been completely proved in @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the desired energy of individual node is given as ( [ desired_constraint ] ) .",
    "the energy generation algorithm computes @xmath6 ; and then @xmath6 is used for the computation of @xmath2 at the energy distribution algorithm .",
    "it is also noticeable that the solutions of the energy generation and energy distribution algorithms are computed through communications among neighboring nodes .",
    "so , after obtaining the solutions @xmath6 and @xmath2 , each node generates physical energy and distributes energy to the neighboring nodes simultaneously .",
    "in this case , the sum of the desired energies of all nodes is well given as @xmath47 . for the balanced case , we consider the following scenario : +  six nodes : @xmath48 , and @xmath49 +  seven undirected edges : @xmath50 +  initial energies : @xmath51 , and @xmath52 +  desired energies : @xmath53 , and @xmath54 +  lower boundaries of generation capability : @xmath55 for all @xmath10 +  upper boundaries of generation capability : @xmath56 and @xmath57    clearly , since @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , the supply - demand balance is satisfied . now using the discoord algorithms given in the previous section ,",
