    "high energy heavy flavor suppression  @xcite is considered to be an excellent probe of qcd matter created in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "one of the major goals of these experiments is mapping the qgp properties , which requires comparing available suppression data with the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "such comparison tests different theoretical models and provides an insight into the underlying qgp physics . having this in mind the upcoming 5.1 tev pb+pb measurements at lhc ( expected at the end of 2015 ) - and their comparison with theoretical predictions - will provide an additional important insight in the jet - medium interactions in qgp created in such collisions . with this motivation in mind , the goal of this paper is providing the heavy flavor suppression predictions , and physical interpretation behind the obtained results , for the upcoming high - luminosity experimental data at 5.1 tev pb+pb collisions at lhc .",
    "in particular , we aim assessing the differences in the predicted suppression with respect to the already available 2.76 tev measurements at lhc and compare the results of state - of - the - art calculations with simple expectations / estimates .    to generate the theoretical predictions we will use our recently developed dynamical energy loss formalism , which includes : _",
    "i ) _ dynamical scattering centers , _ ii ) _ qcd medium of a finite size  @xcite , _ iii ) _ both radiative  @xcite and collisional  @xcite energy losses , _ iv ) _ finite magnetic mass effects  @xcite and _ v ) _ running coupling  @xcite .",
    "this energy loss formalism is based on the pqcd calculations in finite size optically thin dynamical qcd medium , and has been incorporated into a numerical procedure  @xcite that allows generating state - of - the art suppression predictions .",
    "the model has shown to be successful in explaining a wide range of angular averaged observables  @xcite at both rhic and lhc .",
    "since the angular averaged @xmath1s are largely insensitive to the medium evolution , angular averaged @xmath1 can be considered an excellent probe for jet - medium interactions  @xcite ; consequently , the suppression predictions at 5.1 tev pb+pb collisions at lhc , and their comparison with the measurements , will allow further testing of our energy loss formalism .",
    "for generating the suppression predictions , we use the computational procedure from  @xcite .",
    "the main features are briefly summarized below , while the full account of the procedure is provided in  @xcite .",
    "the quenched spectra of heavy flavor observables are calculated according to the generic pqcd convolution : @xmath2    in the equation above subscripts `` i '' and `` f '' correspond , respectively , to `` initial '' and `` final '' , and @xmath3 denotes heavy quarks .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the initial heavy quark spectrum , which is computed at next to leading order according to  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 is the energy loss probability ; this probability includes both radiative and collisional energy loss in a finite size dynamical qcd medium , multi - gluon  @xcite and path - length fluctuations  @xcite and running coupling  @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is the fragmentation function of heavy quark @xmath3 to hadron @xmath7 , where for d and b mesons we use , bcfy  @xcite and klp  @xcite fragmentation functions , respectively .",
    "finally , decay of b mesons to experimentally measured non - prompt @xmath8 is represented by @xmath9 and obtained according to  @xcite .",
    "the expression for the radiative energy loss in a finite size dynamical qcd medium is extracted from eq .",
    "( 10 ) in  @xcite , while the collisional energy loss is extracted from eq .",
    "( 14 ) in  @xcite .",
    "path length distributions are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the angular averaged @xmath1 is a clear jet - medium interaction probe , i.e. it is not sensitive on the details of the medium evolution  @xcite , so we model the medium by assuming constant average temperature of qgp . to determine the average temperatures at 0 - 10% most central collisions , we start from @xmath10mev ( the effective temperature extracted by alice  @xcite for 0 - 40% centrality ) , and use the procedure outlined in  @xcite ( based on gluon rapidity density ) to determine the temperatures at central collisions at 2.76 and 5.1 tev pb+pb collisions ; for 2.76 tev 0 - 10% centrality , this leads to the average temperature of 313 mev . to determine the temperature at 5.1 tev , note that it is expected that the gluon rapidity density will be 25% higher at 5.1 tev than at 2.76 tev in pb+pb collisions at lhc  @xcite .",
    "since the temperature is proportional to the gluon rapidity density , i.e. @xmath11 , this leads to @xmath12 higher temperature at 5.1 tev compared to 2.76 tev at the lhc , i.e. 335 mev for 0 - 10% central 5.1 tev pb+pb collisions at lhc .",
    "note that , in our energy loss calculations , this is the only parameter that differs between the two systems ; i.e. all the other parameters that enter in the calculations ( stated in the next paragraph ) are the same for the two systems , and correspond to the standard literature values ( i.e. no parameters are determined through fitting the data ) .",
    "the following parameters are used in the numerical calculations : qgp with effective light quark flavors @xmath13 and perturbative qcd scale of @xmath14  gev .",
    "the debye mass is taken to be @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) gev for 2.76 ( 5.1 ) tev collision energy , and is obtained by self - consistently solving eq .",
    "( 7 ) in  @xcite .",
    "the value for magnetic to electric mass ratio @xmath17 is extracted from non - perturbative calculations  @xcite @xmath18 ; the gluon mass is @xmath19  @xcite , while the charm and the bottom mass are , respectively , @xmath20gev and @xmath21gev .",
    "path - length distribution , parton production , fragmentation functions and decays , which are used in the numerical calculations , are specified above .",
    "to get an insight of what results we expect at 5.1 tev collisions at the lhc , we will first provide a simple analytic estimate for heavy flavor suppression at this collision energy .",
    "for that purpose , note that radiative energy loss is widely considered to be a dominant energy loss mechanism in qgp , so we will use only the radiative contribution for the estimate .",
    "since it is also widely assumed that radiative energy loss is proportional to @xmath22 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , one can estimate that the energy loss at 5.1 tev should be @xmath23 higher than at 2.76 tev .",
    "based on this , and if we assume that initial distributions can be approximated by power low distributions , i.e. @xmath24 , we can make an estimate on how much larger / smaller suppression one would expect at 5.1 tev compared to the already observed results at 2.76 tev .",
    "it was previously shown that , for radiative energy loss and power low initial distributions , suppression can be roughly estimated by using the following simple formula  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fractional energy loss .",
    "if we assume that , at 2.76 tev , typical fractional energy loss for charm is @xmath0 and for bottom @xmath27 , and that charm and bottom distributions do not notably change between these two collision energies , with @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) for charm ( bottom ) , the above estimate will straightforwardly lead to the expectation of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) larger suppression for charm ( bottom ) at 5.1 tev compared to 2.76 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "contrary to these expectations , figure  [ suppfig1 ] shows that our suppression calculations - obtained from the energy loss formalism outlined in the previous section - provide substantially different predictions . from this figure",
    ", we actually do not observe any suppression increase between 2.76 to 5.1 tev collisions at the lhc .",
    "that is , we obtain the same suppression patterns for both charm and bottom probes ( d mesons and non - prompt @xmath8 ) at these two collision energies .",
    "this then leads to the question of , why the increase in the collision energy by almost a factor of 2 , leads to the same predicted suppression patterns between the two collisional energies , despite the estimated significant ( i.e. @xmath0 for charm , see above ) increase in the suppression ?    to address this question , in fig .",
    "[ ptdist ] we first compare charm and bottom initial distributions between these two collision energies . from this figure",
    ", we see that the distributions at 5.1 tev are slightly flatter than at 2.76 tev , for both charm and bottom , which will have the tendency to somewhat lower the suppression at 5.1 tev compared to 2.76 tev .",
    "note that only the shape of the distributions contributes to the suppression predictions , and from fig .",
    "[ ptdist ] , one can observe that the differences in the shape of the distributions are not large .",
    "still , this difference in the distributions has a notable ( though again not large , i.e. @xmath32 ) effect on the suppression predictions , as can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ decreaseincrease ] ; therefore , it should be taken into account in the suppression calculations .",
    "however , what we further see from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ decreaseincrease ] is that the effect on the suppression coming from the energy loss increase between 2.76 and 5.1 tev ( due to the increase in average temperature ) is also notable but not large , i.e. it corresponds to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "that is , the energy loss effect on the suppression has about the same magnitude , but an opposite direction , compared to the effect of different distributions between these two collision energies .",
    "the first question that we want to address is why the effect of the energy loss increase on jet suppression is not larger between these two collision energies , at least not for charm quark .",
    "that is , based on the common @xmath22 assumption , we have estimated that the energy loss increase should be on the order of @xmath35 , which should , therefore , have a more prominent ( estimated  30% ) effect on the suppression .    regarding the @xmath22 estimate for the radiative energy loss , note that , while widely used , this estimate does not have to be justified .",
    "that is , from eq .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite , which shows the radiative energy loss expression in a finite size dynamical qcd medium , it can be straightforwardly observed that the expression nontrivially depends on t. that is , while one can recover a part with explicit dependence on @xmath22 in this expression , the rest of the expression also depends on t , where this extra term considerably modifies the temperature dependence .",
    "additionally , the collisional energy loss effect , while smaller compared to the radiative , is still important , and this effect also has to be taken into account in the suppression calculations . note that , for the collisional energy loss , it is commonly assumed that it has a quadratic ( @xmath36 ) dependence on the temperature .",
    "however , similarly to the above discussion for the radiative energy loss , eq .",
    "( 14 ) from @xcite shows a nontrivial temperature dependence , so we will below also test whether this simple ( @xmath36 ) assumption is justified .    with these goals , in fig .",
    "[ elossratiodifftemp ] , we plot the relative heavy flavor energy loss increase between 2.76 and 5.1 collision energies at the lhc . figures also contain dashed horizontal lines , which represent what would be the energy loss increase , if it would indeed have @xmath36 or @xmath22 dependence . for radiative energy loss , we see that , contrary to the common expectations , energy loss increase is far from @xmath22 dependence ; i.e. it is between linear ( for low jet energy regions ) and quadratic ( which can be reached for asymptotically high jet energies ) .",
    "consequently , for the high momentum heavy flavor hadrons that will be studied at these two collision energies at the lhc , the expected energy loss increase is notably smaller than quadratic , i.e. it is in the region between @xmath37 ( note that the average temperature increase between these two collision energies is @xmath12 ) . for the collisional energy loss , we also see that energy loss increase is far from quadratic , i.e. the increase of @xmath38 is constant with momentum and it has slightly larger than linear dependence on temperature .",
    "consequently , contrary to the common expectation , the total energy loss has also a modest temperature dependence , which is close to linear , i.e. between 6 and 10% depending on the jet momentum .",
    "this modest energy loss increase between these two collisional energies consequently leads to a modest increase in the suppression which we observe in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ decreaseincrease ] .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ suppression ] , we study the combined effect of the differences in the distributions and the energy loss on jet suppression . on the two left panels , we see the effect of the difference in the distributions on the jet suppression , while the energy loss is kept fixed . on the two central panels , we keep the same distribution , but change the energy loss , while in the two right panels both the distributions and the energy loss are changed between the two collision energies . from the panels ,",
    "we see that , while the change in the distribution has the tendency to reduce the suppression , the energy loss increase increases the suppression for about the same amount , so that the resultant suppression at 5.1 tev collision energy is almost the same as at 2.76 tev .",
    "the above obtained numerical result can also be directly estimated from eq .",
    "[ suppsimpolified ] . for this purpose",
    ", we will take that the energy loss between 2.76 and 5.1 tev collision energy increases by factor @xmath39 , where from fig .",
    "[ elossratiodifftemp ] , we see that @xmath40 for both charm and bottom .",
    "additionally , we will take that the power factor in the initial parton distributions decrease by @xmath41 ; by fitting the power low to the ratio of the momentum distributions in fig .",
    "[ ptdist ] , we obtain @xmath42 . by applying these factors into eq .",
    "[ suppsimpolified ] , one can straightforwardly obtain @xmath43 where for @xmath41 and @xmath39 estimated above the second additive in the above becomes close to zero .",
    "consequently , this estimate also recovers the conclusion of the same heavy flavor suppression at 2.76 and 5.1 tev pb+pb collision energies at the lhc .",
    "in this paper , we provided heavy flavor suppression predictions for the upcoming 5.1 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc . based on our energy loss formalism",
    ", we predict the same heavy flavor suppression patterns for 2.76 and 5.1 tev collision energies .",
    "this result is surprising since , based on the commonly used assumption , a notable increase of the suppression is expected at the higher collision energy .",
    "we showed that the same suppression is a consequence of the interplay between the following two effects : _ i _ ) a decrease in the suppression due to flattening of the initial momentum distributions , and _ ii _ ) an increase in the suppression - though more moderate than expected - due to higher energy loss .",
    "consequently , this unexpected , but simple , suppression prediction provides a direct ( both quantitative and qualitative ) test of our understanding of the medium interactions in qcd medium created in these collisions .    _",
