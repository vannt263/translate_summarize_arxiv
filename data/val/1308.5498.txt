    "be / x - ray binaries are a group of high - mass x - ray binaries that consist of a neutron star and an ob - type star with balmer emission lines ( be star ) .",
    "they are major members of recurrent x - ray transients and are usually detected when they exhibit bright x - ray outbursts lasting for a week to months . during the outbursts , the x - ray luminosities increase by 35 orders of magnitude from those in the quiescent states .",
    "although the mechanism of these outbursts has not been fully understood , it is considered to be related with mass accretion from the circumstellar disc of the be star onto the neutron star .",
    "x - ray outbursts of be / x - ray binaries are classified into two types , normal outbursts ( type - i ) and giant ones ( type - ii ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the former usually occur when the neutron star passes through the periastron , and hence repeat by the orbital period .",
    "their peak luminosities distribute in a narrow range of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "some of those sources showed moderate spin - up of the neutron star during the normal outbursts ( e.g. gs  1843@xmath302 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , the latter , namely giant outbursts , are characterised by their higher x - ray luminosity ( typically @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 ) , longer duration , less frequent occurrence , and their orbital phases out of the periastron @xcite .",
    "since large spin - up episodes of the neutron star often accompany giant outbursts , an accretion disc is considered to form around the neutron star in occasions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the observational outburst classification , a new scenario based on the analytical / numerical studies @xcite is proposed to explain the two type of outbursts by different mass accretion mechanism .",
    "a 0535 + 26 is one of the representative be / x - ray binaries in our galaxy .",
    "the source was discovered by the ariel-5 satellite @xcite when it exhibited a giant outburst in 1975 .",
    "the subsequent observations revealed its 103-s coherent x - ray pulsation @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart is the o9.7 iiie star hd245770 at a distance of 1.8@xmath50.6 kpc @xcite .",

    "its orbital elements , including the orbital period ( 111.1@xmath50.1 day ) , eccentricity ( 0.47@xmath50.02 ) and the epoch of the periastron passage ( mjd=53613.0 ) , were determined by @xcite .",
    "both normal and giant outbursts have been observed so far @xcite .",
    "the giant outbursts were observed nine times , typically every a few years ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these events occurred after the periastron passages , and were followed by a sequence of normal outbursts .    in 2008",
    "september , the _ rxte_/asm detected a renewed activity of a 0535 + 26 , since the previous active period which ended in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the new active period continued three years until 2011 november , and the source meanwhile exhibited nine outbursts including both the normal and the giant ones .",
    "this is the longest active period that has ever been observed since its discovery @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the x - ray outbursts of a 0535 + 26 during the above active period , based on continuous monitoring by the maxi / gsc @xcite and the swift / bat @xcite .",

    "the hardness ratio of the swift / bat band to the maxi / gsc band is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "nine sequential outbursts are clearly recognized in the swift / bat light curve with 111.1-days orbital cycle . as shown in figure [ f1 ] , we hereafter call them out - a , b , c , ... , and j.    the first three outbursts , namely out - a , b , and c , exhibited their peaks at times approximately consistent with periastron passages .",

    "the source reached the outburst maximum 9.3 d after the periastron , and the hardness ratio changed significantly across the outburst . assuming that the x - ray emission is isotropic and the spectrum shape is like the crab nebula , the total x - ray energy released during the outburst period ( mjd=5515755201 ) in the 410 kev band is estimated to be @xmath13 erg from the daily maxi / gsc light curve .",

    "no precursor was seen in either the maxi / gsc or the swift / bat data .",
    "the hardness ratio changed with the flux similarly as in out - e .",
    "the next periastron after out - i was observable with neither mission due to the sun avoidance .",
    "however , the positive flux detected on mjd@xmath1555745 suggests the presence of another outburst ( out - j ) .",
    "this possibly faint outburst was not observed by the fermi / gbm .",
    "after that , no significant flux have been observed from the source till the end of 2012 .",
    "in addition to the x - ray activities , significant optical variations have also been reported in these period @xcite .",
    "the v - band magnitude started to decrease in the epoch of out - a and then reach the quiescent level in the out - d . on the other hand , the equivalent width of h@xmath18 line increased around the out - d and then decreased after the out - f .",
    "( 85mm,)f2.eps    as described in the previous section , the outbursts ( out - e , f and g ) and the precursors both exhibited significant offsets in orbital phase from the periastron passages . in this paper , we calculated the epoch of periastron passages using the orbital elements in @xcite , which were determined from x - ray observations in 2005 .",
    "judging from the precision of the orbital period ( 111.1@xmath50.1 d ) , the error of the extrapolated periastron time in 20092011 is @xmath151 d at most . in order to better visualize this effect , figure [ f2 ]",
    "shows the same light curves , but in cycle - by - cycle form , against the orbital phase .",

    "interestingly , out - h , which did not develop into a large one , consisted of two peaks like out - d .",
    "the former event can be identified as a precursor based on an orbital - phase extrapolation from out - e , f , and g. the second peak can be considered as a main outburst , although its intensity is smaller than that of typical outburst . in the next outburst , out - i , the peak just came after the periastron , and neither a precursor nor a post - outburst flare were observed .",

    "we analyzed long - term x - ray light curves of a 0535 + 26 obtained by the maxi / gsc ( 410 kev ) and the swift / bat ( 1550 kev ) during the active season from 2008 september to 2011 november .",
    "this is the longest active period of this x - ray source that has ever been observed since its discovery in 1975 .",
    "the source exhibited nine outbursts which are approximately synchronized with the binary period of 111.1 d. four of them recurred every 115 d which is significantly longer than the binary period . in both data sets , we also found low - level active periods , or precursors , which preceded the large outbursts .",
    "below , we discuss the cause of the asynchronous outburst occurrence and of the precursor activity .",
    "outbursts in be / x - ray binaries are classified into normal ( type - i ) and giant ( type - ii ) ones , according to their luminosity and orbital phase at the flux peak ( e.g. review by @xcite ) .",
    "normal outbursts have peak luminosities below @xmath42 erg s@xmath2 , and occurs at or near the periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "giant outbursts exhibit higher luminosities exceeding @xmath42 erg s@xmath2 , and their orbital phases do not necessarily coincide with the periastron . according to the classical definition",
    ", we can classify out - a , b , and c into normal , while out - e and i readily into giant ones . on the other hand , the other outbursts , out - d , f",
    ", g and h , can not be categorized into either type . as pointed out by @xcite , the simple classification can not be always applied . from the monotonical peak - phase shift ( figure [ f2 ] and figure [ f3 ] ) and exponential decay of the peak fluxes ( figure [ f5 ] ) , we presume that the giant outburst ( out - e ) and the following ones ( out - f , g , and h ) have the same mechanism . those followings might be named as `` giant outburst remnant '' .",
    "in addition to the variety in the luminosity and the orbital phase as described above , out - d , has a peculiar double - peaked profile .",
    "so far , outbursts with such a double - peaked profile have been observed three times from this source , in 1993 ( july and november ; @xcite ) and 2005 august @xcite .",
    "however , the latter event is a `` pre - outburst flare '' which lasted for less than a few hours @xcite ; we consider it as a different phenomenon from the double - peaked outburst such as out - d , whose duration ( @xmath1510 days ) is much longer .",
    "in addition to a 0535 + 26 , such double - peaked outbursts have been observed from two other be / x - ray binaries , xte j1946 + 274 @xcite and gx304 - 1 @xcite . among those three sources ,",
    "a 0535 + 26 and gx304 - 1 exhibited giant outbursts after the detection of a double - peaked outburst .",
    "therefore , double - peaked outbursts might be considered as a sign of the recurrence of giant outbursts @xcite , and may be recognized as an intermediate class between the normal and giant ones .",
    "as analyzed in section [ sec3 ] , the outburst - peak phase shifted steadily through the four giant outbursts , from out - e to out - h , and their peak intensity decayed on a time scale of 7791 d. such an effect has been observed from two other be / x - ray binaries : exo 2030 + 375 @xcite and gs  0834 - 430 @xcite .",
    "however , the precursor phase shift observed in the present study was not reported from the other sources .",
    "furthermore , the phase shift in a 0535 + 26 ( @xmath1520 days ) is much larger than that of exo 2030 + 375 ( @xmath155 days ) .",
    "since x - ray intensity is considered to provide a probe of the circumstellar disc of the be star along the neutron - star orbit , the outburst phase shift is considered to reflect density profiles in the be disc .",
    "let us assume that dense parts are produced in the disc by some perturbations , and that they rotates with a certain rotational frequency , @xmath43 .",
    "we further assume that it couples with the orbital frequency @xmath44 d@xmath2 to produce a beat frequency @xmath45 as , @xmath46 and identify @xmath47 with the period @xmath48 d with which the consecutive giant outbursts emerged .",
    "equation ( [ e2 ] ) then yields @xmath49 d@xmath2 , which corresponds to a period of @xmath50 years .",
    "below , we discuss two possible scenarios to explain the orbital phase shift of the outbursts including this @xmath45 , referring to figure [ f6 ] which summarizes the present observations .",
    "one possible explanation of the evolution of the outburst profile is a model of density perturbation called `` global one - armed oscillation '' on a be disc ( e.g. @xcite ) , proposed to explain long - term variations of double - peaked ( violet and red ) h@xmath18 emission lines ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the violet - to - red intensity ratio , so called v / r ratio , varies on timescales of years to decades .",
    "the one - armed oscillation model explains it as due to a slow rotation of a dense part on the disc .",
    "although various oscillation modes can be excited when the disc is formed , those with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 being the azimuthal wave number ) are supposed to dissipate sooner and finally only the one - armed ( @xmath53 ) oscillation will remain .",
    "( 85mm,)f6.eps    previous optical studies on a 0535 + 26 @xcite reported that the source exhibited v / r variations with a @xmath15500 d quasi - periodicity from mjd@xmath54 to mjd@xmath55 .",
    "it suggests the emergence of the one - armed oscillation mode . in that period ,",
    "ew representing the density at the outer part of the be disc and its size , began to increase gradually at around mjd@xmath56 @xcite . when the be disc extended and reached the periastron of the neutron star",
    ", normal outbursts would occur .",
    "this can explain the three successive normal outbursts from out - a to out - c .",
    "while the h@xmath18 ew increased , the v - band brightness decreased @xcite .",
    "this suggests the production of a low - density region at an inner part of the be disc @xcite , which would expand slowly outwards to produce a low - density ring structure .",
    "this can account for the double - peak outburst in out - d @xcite .",
    "after out - d , the v / r variation did not follow the 500 d periodicity any longer @xcite , presumably due to some changes in the physical condition of the be disc @xcite .",
    "in fact , the v - band brightening around mjd 55100 @xcite and the very large h@xmath18 ew around mjd 55150 @xcite suggest an episodic mass ejection from the be - star equator .",
    "the emerged high - density region would propagate to the outer part of the disc on a time scale of one orbital cycle @xcite , and then expand the be disc extremely .",
    "the high - density region of the perturbed disc is expected to rotate slowly around the be star . if its period is @xmath57 , the observed peak - phase shift of the outbursts can be explained .",
    "besides the outbursts , the precursors also emerged with 115 d periodicity from out - e to out - h .",
    "since the precursors appeared at nearly opposite orbital locations of the giant outbursts ( figure [ f6 ] ) , they may be explained by the density perturbation in an unstable @xmath58 oscillation mode which embeds a two - arm structure .",
    "the estimated rotational period of the density perturbation ( @xmath50 yr ) is considerably longer than the typical v / r variation period of @xmath59 yr @xcite and comparable to the statistical mean of the v / r variation periods of isolated be stars , @xmath60 yr ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "optical observations of a 0535 + 26 ( figure 2 of @xcite and figure 4 of @xcite ) indicate that there would be a longer v / r variation period when the outburst orbital phase shift appeared .",
    "this anomalous v / r variation lasted for @xmath17 yr , and vanished when a rapid variation ( period of @xmath61 d ) arose in 2010 october @xcite .      another scenario to explain the orbital phase shift of the outbursts is a be - disc precession",
    "the idea is proposed by @xcite to explain the behaviors of 4u 0115 + 63 . according to this scenario ,",
    "a be disc does not grow as an equatorial planar disc any more when a large amount of gas is emitted .",
    "instead , the disc is considered to be warped by the interaction with the neutron star , and tilted .",
    "the tilted disc starts precessing .",
    "the scenario , applied to a 0535 + 26 , is illustrated in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also examined a similar tilted be - disc geometry to explain the variety of observed outburst behaviors , which are largely classified into the normal or the giant one .",
    "they suggested that giant outbursts could occur if a be disc is misaligned with a binary orbital plane and sufficiently developed so that a neutron star can capture a large amount of mass via bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) accretion .",
    "we here employ the tilted be - disc geometry to explain the observed outburst orbital - phase shifting .",
    "both the optical and x - ray observations suggest that a large amount of gas was ejected from the be - star equator after out - d as described in subsection [ sec4.3 ] . as a consequence , a tilted and sufficiently developed disc may be formed and start a prograde precession .",
    "in fact , we can see in figure [ f6 ] that each outburst and the associated precursor occurred at nearly opposite orbital locations with respect to the be star , and their peak locations were delayed every binary orbit by @xmath62 orbital phase .",
    "these results can be explained by such a scenario that the precursor and the main outburst occur at the two intersections between the neutron star orbit and the be disc plane .",
    "the recurrence period of the giant outbursts , 115 d , can be explained if the disc precesses by the phase shift rate @xmath31 , which is @xmath63 per pulsar s orbital period of 111.1 d ( see figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "we also noticed that there is a inconsistency in the be disc precession period between our result ( @xmath50 yr ) and the previous ones ( 674 or 886 d ; @xcite ) , although such a comparison is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the intensity of precursors grew up with time , since these orbital phase became closer to the periastron where the disc density is thickest .",
    "the main peak intensity declined vice verse as it became further away from the be star with time .    in this scenario , the out - h peak at around mjd@xmath64 is considered as a precursor , and the smaller peak later at around mjd@xmath65 is considered as a main outburst .",
    "thus , the intensities of the main peaks and the precursors of out - e , f , g , and h can be considered to represent the density change with time of the tilted be disc formed at around out - d .",
    "this scenario thus gives a reasonable explanation to the present observation , except the first of the two precursors of out - e : another smaller tilted or warped disc would be required for it .",
    "further modeling of the be disc is left for future works .",
    "over the 2009 august  2011 march active period of the be / x - ray binary pulsar a 0535 + 26 , nine outbursts were detected , of which two are categorized into giant ( type - ii ) outbursts according to the peak intensity and the orbital phase .",
    "the giant outbursts and subsequent outbursts recurred with a period of 115 d , which is significantly longer than the 111.1 d orbital period . prior to these phase - shifting outbursts",
    ", we detected the precursors , which also repeated with the 115 d period .",
    "this period shift is considered to reflect some structure , of the circumstellar disc formed around the be companion star . if such structures have an intrinsic period of @xmath50 yr , the observed giant - outburst period can be explained by its beat with the orbital period .",

    "<S> over the 3-year active period from 2008 september to 2011 november , the outburst behavior of the be / x - ray binary a 0535 + 26 was continuously monitored with the maxi / gsc and the swift / bat . </S>",
    "<S> the source exhibited nine outbursts , every binary revolution of 111.1 days , of which two are categorized into the giant ( type - ii ) outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the recurrence period of these outbursts is found to be @xmath0 days , significantly longer than the orbital period of 111.1 days . with the maxi / gsc , a low - level active period , or a `` precursor '' , </S>",
    "<S> was detected prior to at least four giant outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the precursor recurrence period agrees with that of the giant outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the period difference of the giant outbursts from the orbital period is possibly related with some structures in the circumstellar disc formed around the be companion . </S>",
    "<S> two scenarios , one based on a one - armed disc structure and the other a be - disc precession , are discussed . </S>"
