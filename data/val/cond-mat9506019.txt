    "@xcite ) there are clearly two regimes , separated by a scale @xmath5k . for @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11 drops more rapidly ; indeed a straight line fit to @xmath11 for @xmath12 ( @xmath13k is the superconducting transition temperature for this compound ) would yield a _ negative _ @xmath3 at @xmath14 .",
    "a negative @xmath15 is impossible ; therefore the negative extrapolation implies that even for @xmath16 ( but @xmath10 ) there is a gap for spin excitations .",
    "the origin of this `` spin '' gap is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the properties of high temperature superconducting materials are anomalous , and many different theories have been proposed to describe them . however , no general consensus has emerged .",
    "the origin of spin gap has been discussed by many authors @xcite but these treatments are not completely satisfactory because , as we shall argue below , they are based on models which do not agree with all available data .",
    "we believe that any theory of the spin gap should have the following ingredients :    * at least some of the magnetic response is pauli - like , i.e. it comes from a particle - hole continuum of spin @xmath17 fermions . *",
    "formation of the spin gap involves pairing instability of these fermions .",
    "* this pairing is _ not _ a superconducting pairing , i.e. does not produce a meissner effect or paraconductivity .",
    "these assumptions imply that paired fermions are neutral and that any theory of the spin gap must involve the phenomenon of spin - charge separation ; we use the gauge theory formalism to describe this .",
    "susceptibility of several high @xmath2 materials : one - plane @xmath18 with varying doping @xmath19 which , as we shall argue , does not show spin gap behavior and bilayer @xmath4 ( 248 ) which shows it .",
    "susceptibility is measured in the units of @xmath20 per @xmath21 atom .",
    "points ( i)-(iii ) do not completely specify the model .",
    "there are two additional issues .",
    "* it is widely believed that there are strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in high-@xmath2 materials . in the body of the paper",
    "we summarize the evidence for the existence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , outline the different theories proposed to describe them , and give the implications for our calculations . *",
    "we believe that bilayer structure of @xmath4 is important for the formation of the spin gap because it leads to interplane pairing .",
    "whether the spin gap exists in single - plane materials such as @xmath18 , in which interplane coupling is geometrically frustrated , is controversial @xcite . certainly , the evidence for it is weaker ( see fig .",
    "our theoretical results imply that spin gap effects are greatly enhanced in bilayer or multilayer systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the relevant experimental data and show that it implies points ( i)-(v ) above . in section iii",
    "we formulate the theoretical model and identify two different scenarios . in section iv and v we present the solutions for the different scenarios .",
    "section v contains a comparison of results to data and a conclusion .",
    "\\(i ) _ particle - hole continuum _ : we begin with the evidence that at least some of the magnetic response in spin - gap systems such as @xmath4 comes from a particle - hole continuum of spin @xmath17 fermions .",
    "a phenomenological argument is that there is little doubt that such a continuum describes the magnetic properties of @xmath22 .",
    "the uniform susceptibility of this compound has magnitude slightly larger than predicted by band theory and has very weak temperature dependence ( as expected for a fermi liquid ) @xcite .",
    "the oxygen nmr relaxation rate @xmath23 is temperature independent ( as expected in a fermi liquid ) and has magnitude slightly larger than predicted by the korringa relation @xcite .",
    "the copper relaxation rate @xmath24 increases as the temperature is decreased @xcite ; this has been argued to be due to antiferromagnetic correlations within a fermi liquid state @xcite .",
    "also , photoemission experiments @xcite have observed a large fermi surface in optimally doped @xmath22 .",
    "the spin - gap compounds @xmath25 and @xmath4 are produced by removing carriers from @xmath22 ; further , the physical properties seem to vary smoothly with doping .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the particle hole continuum is also present in the spin - gap compounds .",
    "an alternative point of view @xcite is that the important spin excitations in underdoped compounds are weakly damped , gapped antiferromagnetic spin waves , with dispersion @xmath26 .",
    "however , theories in which the only magnetic excitations are spin waves with a gap are inconsistent with the @xmath27 data at _ high temperatures _ ( @xmath6 ) , because at temperatures greater than the value of the zero - temperature gap @xmath28 , these theories predict @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 if @xmath31 and also predict for @xmath4 a value for @xmath32 larger , by a factor of six , than is observed @xcite .",
    "another difficulty with the spin - wave - only model is that the kinematics of spin waves implies that the oxygen relaxation rate drops very rapidly with temperature . indeed",
    "the theoretical prediction is @xmath33 \\sim t$ ] in contrast to the experimental result @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite therefore there is little doubt that one must at least supplement the spin wave model with a particle - hole continuum of fermions which controls at least the small @xmath35 spin response @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that although the existence of such a particle - hole continuum would increase the constant part , @xmath8 , of the uniform susceptibility and would add a constant contribution to the oxygen relaxation rate , it would not affect the slope , @xmath32 , of the susceptibility if the interaction between spin waves and particle - hole continuum is weak .",
    "there is as yet no model which describes all of the data . in any event , to understand the spin gap observed in @xmath36 one must understand how to open a gap in the spectrum of the fermions making up the particle - hole continuum .",
    "\\(ii ) _ singlet pairing _ : in the absence of charge density wave order the only possibility for suppressing the spin response of fermions is to pair them into singlets .",
    "one example of such pairing is the bcs superconducting state .",
    "the pairing scale @xmath37 is much less than any microscopic scale such as @xmath38 or the bandwidth , so the pairing must be understood as a low energy instability of the system .",
    "\\(iii ) _ superconductivity _ : the data strongly suggest that the spin gap is not due to incipient superconducting pairing .",
    "there are two arguments ; one is that the spin gap scale @xmath1 in @xmath4 is approximately @xmath39k , far above the maximum @xmath40k observed in any member of the ybco family .",
    "the second is that superconducting fluctuations normally have a dramatic effect on the resistivity , which begins to drop as @xmath41 is decreased through the scale at which the fluctuations begin and drops more and more rapidly as @xmath2 is approached .",
    "this behavior is not observed in @xmath25 and in @xmath4 . in these materials , there is some drop in @xmath42 as @xmath41 is decreased through @xmath1 , but then @xmath42 flattens out and depends only weakly on @xmath41 near @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the drop in @xmath42 for @xmath43 has been attributed @xcite , in our view correctly , to changes in the inelastic scattering mechanism associated with the onset of the spin gap .",
    "it has been argued that negative @xmath44 hubbard model , in which the important physics is singlet pairing of conventional electrons describes the spin gap phenomena @xcite . in our view",
    "the strong evidence for repulsive interactions and against paraconductivity renders this model irrelevant .    to summarize : the data imply the existence of a particle - hole continuum of spin excitations and require that these excitations be paired into singlets in a way that does not produce superconductivity .",
    "this implies that `` spin - charge separation '' must occur .",
    "there are many scenarios of spin - charge separation , all stemming from anderson s original proposal @xcite .",
    "we shall adopt the gauge theory approach @xcite .",
    "we also note that unlike the conventional superconducting pairing of electrons , the pairing of chargeless fermions does not necessary imply the breaking of any symmetry , and so may result in a crossover , not in a genuine phase transition @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) _ antiferromagnetism _ : a large literature has developed around the issue of antiferromagnetic correlations in high @xmath2 materials .",
    "many controversies remain unresolved , but it is generally agreed that nmr @xmath45 and @xmath46 experiments imply the existence of strong , temperature dependent antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "specifically , for @xmath4 , the two @xmath21 relaxation rates , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , increase roughly as @xmath49 as @xmath41 is decreased ( for @xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "generally , the nmr rates are given by @xmath51 ^ 2 \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\label{t_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a form factor which is different for different nuclei .",
    "the only tenable interpretation of the temperature dependence of the copper relaxation rate is that both real and imaginary parts of @xmath53 diverge at a particular wavevector @xmath54 , i.e. that there is an incipient magnetic instability . to prove this ,",
    "suppose on the contrary that the @xmath41-dependence of @xmath55 came from a wide range of momenta , so @xmath56 , with @xmath57 a temperature independent function .",
    "for large frequencies , @xmath58 , @xmath59 should not depend on temperature , so in particular the imaginary part @xmath60 , whereas at small frequencies , @xmath61 , @xmath62 should be proportional to frequency , @xmath63 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient , @xmath64 , can be estimated by matching the low frequency formula and the high frequency formula at @xmath65 , yielding @xmath66 .",
    "the nmr @xmath45 data imply @xmath67 which via the kramers - kronig relation implies @xmath68 .",
    "this temperature dependence is too weak to account for the @xmath46 data , so the hypothesis of a momentum - independent divergence of @xmath3 must be rejected .",
    "it should be noted , however , that although neutron scattering experiments detect antiferromagnetic fluctuations , neutron and nmr data are not quantitatively consistent @xcite    the proper theoretical model for the antiferromagnetic fluctuations is not clear .",
    "the two principal proposals are that the dominant antiferromagnetic excitations are weakly damped spin waves @xcite , or are particle - hole pairs of an antiferromagnetically correlated fermion system @xcite .",
    "the weakly damped spin wave picture applies to the magnetic insulating parent compound and by continuity might be expected to apply to lightly doped but non - ordered materials .",
    "the particle - hole picture presumably applies to the optimally doped materials ( which have been shown by photoemission to have large ( luttinger ) fermi surface ) and by continuity might be expected to apply to somewhat underdoped materials .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes is a active area of research @xcite but has not been understood in detail .",
    "we consider implications of both pictures for the pairing interaction .",
    "the model of particle - hole pairs requires further discussion .",
    "we argued above on the basis of resistivity data that the fermions must be charge zero objects .",
    "an additional argument against conventional charge @xmath69 fermi liquid with antiferromagnetic correlations is that the magnetic properties of conventional fermi liquid are incompatible with the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath70 data @xcite .",
    "the only known model of spin @xmath17 charge @xmath71 fermionic excitations ( `` spinons '' ) which does not break time reversal or parity symmetry is the `` spin liquid '' . in a spin liquid , the gauge interaction between fermions affects the magnetic properties and has been shown to lead to a reasonable description of the spin dynamics of high @xmath2 materials @xcite in the spin - wave picture a particle - hole continuum is also present ; for the reasons given above we must assume that the underlying fermionic excitations are spinons . however , in this case the spin waves dominate the large @xmath35 magnetic response .",
    "\\(v ) _ bilayers _ : our discussion so far has been focussed on members of the @xmath72 family of high @xmath2 materials .",
    "we believe that the magnetic dynamics of members of other families of high @xmath2 materials are similar in all respects except for the existence of a spin gap _ in a wide temperature range above @xmath2_. it is possible that , as some authors have argued @xcite , @xmath18 shows the beginning of spin gap behavior for @xmath73k , relatively near the superconducting @xmath2 .",
    "however , to our knowledge only underdoped members of the @xmath72 family exhibit spin gap behavior over a wide range of temperatures above @xmath2 .",
    "consider first the @xmath70 for @xmath18 data presented in fig .",
    "these are obtained from bulk susceptibility data by subtracting core and van - vleck susceptibilities given in @xcite .",
    "note that although there is a downturn in @xmath36 at @xmath74k , extrapolated value of @xmath75 is positive and relatively large .",
    "although uncertainties in the value of the van - vleck susceptibility may exist , these are in our view by no means large enough to produce a @xmath76 .",
    "the oxygen @xcite and copper @xcite @xmath45 relaxation data similarly show no sign of an extra _ downturn _ at a temperature @xmath16 ( although the rate of increase of the copper @xmath77 may slow for @xmath78 ) . note that at @xmath79 , @xmath18 does exhibit @xmath80 regime as well as other properties difficult to describe in either a fermi liquid or a purely spin wave picture .",
    "we infer from this that the bilayer structure of the y - ba material is important only for raising @xmath1 sufficiently far above @xmath2 that spin gap effects are easily observable .",
    "there is in fact substantial evidence that the spin degrees of freedom in different planes of a bilayer are strongly coupled .",
    "neutron scattering measurements have essentially only detected spin fluctuations in which spin on adjacent @xmath81 layers are perfectly anticorrelated @xcite .",
    "moreover , the coupling between cu spins on adjacent planes has been directly measured in a recent nmr @xmath46 experiment , the cu nuclear spins in one plane of a bilayer were pumped and cu nuclear spins in the other were measured @xcite . this experiment determines the cross relaxation time @xmath82 which is given by expression @xcite @xmath83^{1/2 } \\label{t_2^*}\\ ] ] this expression is very similar to the expression ( [ t_2 ] ) for in - plane relaxation rate , except that instead of a single plane susceptibility @xmath84 it contains @xmath85 which measures the response of spins on plane 1 to the magnetic field on plane 2 .",
    "we assume that electrons on adjacent planes in bilayer interact via the hamiltonian @xmath86 if the interaction , @xmath87 is weak then the between the planes susceptibility , @xmath88 , may be calculated by perturbation theory @xcite and is @xmath89 ^ 2 \\label{chi_12}\\ ] ] experimentally the ratio @xmath90 grows from .14 at 200k to 0.28 at 100k .",
    "this increase reflects the temperature dependence of @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath91 is divergent at some wavevector @xmath92 as @xmath93 and is given by a scaling form @xmath94 ( where @xmath19 and @xmath95 are scaling exponents ) then from eqs .",

    "thus , the observed maximal ratio of @xmath98 implies that the interplane coupling is not negligible , but still may be treated via perturbation theory . in this paper",
    "we shall show that the effect of this interplane coupling on the fermions is large and in fact leads to the opening of a spin gap .",
    "( [ h_perp ] ) applies to @xmath99 and to the multilayer @xmath100 compounds in which the @xmath21 ion in one plane sits directly over the @xmath21 ion in the next lower plane .",
    "it does not apply to @xmath101 compounds in which the crystal structure is such that a @xmath21 ion on plane is coupled equally to four @xmath21 in each adjacent plane , so eq . ( [ h_perp ] )",

    "\\(i ) _ single plane_. in section ii we showed that experiment implies that a theoretical treatment of spin gap effects in high-@xmath2 superconductors should involve pairing of fermions in a spin liquid . in this subsection",

    "we have argued that any theory of the spin gap observed in @xmath260 or @xmath4 must be based on a pairing instability of a fermi sea of chargeless fermions ( i.e. a spin liquid ) in the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the large inelastic scattering found in the models of spin liquids leads to strong pairbreaking effects which can only be overcome by singular pairing interaction .",
    "the most plausible origin of this interaction is a between planes coupling enhanced by in - plane antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "we considered two specific models : a spin liquid with @xmath0 over damped magnetic correlations induced by a gauge field interaction and a spin liquid coexisting with weakly damped antiferromagnetic spin waves .",
    "( a third possible model , namely a spin liquid with magnetic correlations induced by tuning a four fermion interaction , has been considered elsewhere @xcite ) the former model is clearly appropriate to optimally doped materials , where there is convincing photoemission evidence for a large fermi line .",
    "we expect by continuity that it is also appropriate for dopings somewhat below optimal .",
    "weakly damped spin waves exist in the insulating `` parent compaund '' materials , and it has been proposed that low doping induces a gap ( but no damping ) in the spin wave spectrum as well as a particle hole continuum of spin excitations . this picture might be justified if there is a small fermi line ( i.e. `` hole pockets '' ) , but if there is a large ( luttinger ) fermi line the absence of spin wave damping is difficult to justify .",
    "it is controversial which picture applies to the most extensively studied spin gap compounds @xmath261 or @xmath4 .",
    "we analysed both models , obtaining estimates for the onset temperature , @xmath1 , of the spin gap and the angular dependence of the gap function .    in both models",
    "@xmath1 scales as a power of the between planes coupling @xmath160 , and the gap function is sharply peaked about particular regions of the fermi line . in both models , pairing of spinons does not imply a true thermoduynamic transition @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is a crossover temperature and superconductivuty sets in at a lower temperature @xmath2 at which the charge carrying bosons condense .    in the overdamped case the physics",
    "is controlled by divergences in the fermion @xmath0 response function due to the singular gauge field interaction .",
    "these divergencies are characterized by an exponent @xmath129 which depends only on the fermion spin degeneracy @xmath262 and by an energy scale @xmath166 defined in eq .",
    "( [ omega_0 ] ) which varies substantially as one moves along the fermi line .",
    "we found that @xmath263 ( @xmath264 is the maximal value of @xmath265 on the fermi line which occurs at @xmath266 ) . at @xmath267 the gap is very sharply peaked at @xmath268 .",
    "as @xmath41 is lowered the region where gap is appreciable grows and the @xmath14 gap @xmath269 .",
    "evidently the result depends sensitively on the exponent @xmath129 which has been estimated to be in the range @xmath132 .",
    "consistency with nmr for @xmath270 requires that @xmath271 ; for this range of @xmath129 @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath160 to a power of order 1 and is of the correct order of magnitude , but the precise value depends on numerical coefficients which are not known .    for @xmath272 ,",
    "the spin gap is appreciable over a part of the fermi line , and suppresses the contribution of that part of the fermi line to the uniform susceptibility and nmr relaxation rates .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ omega_0],[delta(theta ) ] ) that the gap is largest along the zone diagonal ( where @xmath273 is largest ) and smallest at the zone corners where @xmath273 becomes very small .",
    "all parts of the fermi line make roughly equal contribution to the oxygen relaxation rate and uniform susceptibility ( although the logarithmic divergence associated with the van hove singularity may emphasize the corners to some extent ) , so we may roughly estimate the suppression of these quantities from the fraction of the fermi line which is gapped .",
    "the copper relaxation rate is more complicated .",
    "it is dominated by the @xmath0 fluctuations which lead to @xmath274    thus the contribution to the @xmath21 relaxation rate is largest where @xmath166 is largest ( i.e. along the zone diagonal ) so one would expect that in this model the formation of the spin gap would suppress the @xmath21 relaxation rate more strongly than the oxygen rate .",
    "however , the contributions of the ungapped portions of the fermi line continue to grow as @xmath41 is lowered , so the maximum in the @xmath21 @xmath47 relaxation rate occurs at a @xmath10 determined by the interplay between these two effects .",
    "we now consider the underdamped case .",
    "the basic assumption is that there are two distinct types of spin excitations : propagating antiferromagnetic spin waves and particle - hole continuum of spinon excitations .",
    "this picture has been derived @xcite from a microscopic hamiltonian using the assumption that the doping is so low that long range magnetic order is present , and it is plausible that it may apply to lightly doped high @xmath2 materials which lack long range order if these materials do not have large ( luttinger ) fermi line but have instead `` hole pockets '' .",
    "an advantage of this picture is that large @xmath35 properties are dominated by spin waves , which explain in a natural way the strong @xmath41 dependence of the @xmath21 @xmath47 and @xmath48 rates observed experimentally .",
    "the disadvantage of this picture is that the same spin waves would give a factor of six too large contribution to @xmath275 at high temperatures so to account for the observed @xmath275 one must assume that the particle - hole continuum leads to a large negative contribution to @xmath275 which almost precisely cancels the spin wave contribution .",
    "we studied the pairing of fermions in the presence of the undamped spin waves .",
    "the pairing interaction is very strongly peaked at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath209 , so the dominant process in the gap equation is a virtual scattering from a state @xmath210 on a fermi line to one at @xmath211 away from the fermi line .",
    "we found that the resulting pairing interaction is very strong , the onset temperature @xmath276 .",
    "as in the overdamped case , the gap has a strong angular dependence , it appears first at a particular point on the fermi line and spreads over it as @xmath41 is decreased .",
    "however in the underdamped case the angular dependence of the gap is controlled by the energy of the intermediate state , @xmath220 .",
    "the pairing affects the particle - hole contribution to physical response functions but does not directly affect the spin wave contribution .",
    "thus , the copper relaxation rate is not significantly affected by the pairing , but the oxygen relaxation rate and uniform susceptibility are .",
    "the detailed temperature dependence is determined by the way in which the gap spreads over the fermi line as the temperature is decreased , and this depends sensitively on the shape of the fermi line and , in particular , on its curvature .",
    "this picture provides a natural explanation of the magnetic properties of lightly doped @xmath99 materials ( @xmath260 with @xmath277 ) in which the @xmath1 inferred from the uniform susceptibility is of the order @xmath278 @xcite while strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations with no evident gap have been observed in neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "however , in this picture the coincidence of @xmath1 with the maximum of the @xmath21 @xmath47 rate observed in @xmath261 and @xmath4 is an accident .",
    "thus , we believe that the overdamped picture is more appropriate to materials with doping greater than one in @xmath261 , while the underdamped picture may be more appropriate for more lightly doped materials .",
    "this general point of view has been advocated by many authors @xcite and has been emphasized recently in ref .",
