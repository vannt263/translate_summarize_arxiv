    "relativistic jets are often produced by accreting compact objects , including both stellar - mass x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei .",
    "jets appear to be important in the dynamics of the overall accretion flow in such systems and a substantial fraction of the accretion energy of x - ray binaries may be dissipated in jets .",
    "understanding the properties and production of jets is important for our understanding of the energetics and dynamics of the accretion process .",
    "further , the jets from x - ray binaries in the milky way are a potentially significant source of energy input to the galactic ism and , if hadronic , a likely source of a cosmic rays @xcite and a possible source of galactic light element nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "recent xmm - newton observations have led to the discovery of a large scale x - ray jet from the long - term x - ray transient and black hole candidate 4u 175533 @xcite . the x - ray source 4u 175533 was discovered with uhuru @xcite and was , therefore , active in 1970 and may have been active earlier .",
    "it was later found to have an unusually soft spectrum @xcite and a hard x - ray tail @xcite suggesting a black hole candidate .",
    "the source shows x - rays dips which indicate that the system has a high inclination and an orbital period of 4.4 days @xcite .",
    "the source was still active in 1993 @xcite , and then found in quiescence in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the source was active for at least 23 years .",
    "the distance to the source is poorly constrained .",
    "it is likely greater than 4  kpc because the optical counterpart ( identified during outburst ; mcclintock , canizares , & hiltner 1978 ) was not detected in quiescence @xcite , but less than 9  kpc because of the low level of visual extinction @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a linear x - ray structure which is roughly symmetric about the position of 4u 175533 extending about @xmath5 to the north - west and @xmath5 to the south - east of the black hole candidate .",
    "there appear to be multiple knots in the jets .",
    "for estimated distances of 49  kpc , the angular size corresponds to jet lengths of 38  pc .",
    "therefore , the jet must have taken at least 10 - 30 years to form .",
    "the source was active for at least 23 years which appears sufficient to have formed the jet .",
    "chandra observations do not show point sources along the jet , but do give a detection of emission over the area of the jet @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the jet emission seen with xmm - newton is truly diffuse and not an alignment of point sources .",
    "the primary questions concerning the jet are : what is the x - ray emission mechanism , how is the jet powered , and what is the total energy in the jet ?",
    "we obtained new observations of 4u 175533 using xmm - newton and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to attempt to measure a multiwavelength spectrum and observe the evolution of the jet .",
    "we describe the x - ray observations and analysis in  2 , the radio observations and analysis in  3 , and draw conclusions regarding the properties of the jet in  4 .",

    "to determine if the features found in the xmm - newton x - ray image are point sources or truly diffuse emission , we analyzed two chandra observations obtained of the same field .",

    "the 2003 observation is the one analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the chandra data were subjected to the usual data processing and event screening and analyzed using the _ ciao _ version 3.1 data analysis package , e.g.  kaaret ( 2005 ) .",
    "we constructed images using all valid events on the s2 and s3 chips for obsid 3510 and all events on the s3 and s4 chips for obsid 4586 .",
    "we computed exposure maps for each image for a power - law spectrum with photon index of 1.5 absorbed by a column density of @xmath61 .",
    "we used the _ wavdetect _ tool to search for x - ray sources .",
    "the sources with detection significance of @xmath62 or higher are listed in table  [ chandrasources ] .",
    "we aligned the chandra observations with sources in the 2mass point source catalog , as done for the xmm - newton image above .",
    "we restricted the sources to have j magnitudes brighter than 12.5 to limit the source density . after applying a shift of @xmath63 to the chandra astrometry , there are 4 matches within @xmath11 between chandra sources in obsid 4586 and 2mass sources .",
    "we conclude that our corrected chandra astrometry for obsid 4586 is good to within @xmath11 .",
    "we aligned obsid 3510 to obsid 4586 using several x - ray sources present in both images .    summing the flux from all of the sources within the jet , as defined by the region shown in fig .",
    "[ bothobs ] , we find that discrete point sources contribute less than 10% of the total jet flux in each observation .",
    "hence , we confirm the results of @xcite that the x - ray jet from 4u 175533 is truly diffuse .",
    "we note that there are chandra point source counterparts to the two radio sources beyond the jet to the northwest .",
    "therefore , these two radio sources are not associated with the diffuse x - ray emission of the jet .    to investigate the flux from 4u 175533 itself , we extracted counts from a circular region with a radius of @xmath22 at the position of the optical counterpart .",
    "we find a total of 3 counts in the 0.38  kev band in the two images .",
    "using a @xmath64 radius region , we estimated the background in the source extraction region to be 3.0 counts .",

    "the number of source counts is 3.0 . for a power - law spectrum with photon index of 1.5 absorbed by a column density of @xmath65 ,",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on the source flux of @xmath66 .",
    "the upper limit on the unabsorbed flux is @xmath67 . for distances of 49  kpc",
    ", this corresponds to a limit on the luminosity of @xmath68 .",
    "this is similar to the quiescent luminosities of other short orbital period black hole x - ray binaries such as xte j1118 + 480 and a 0620 - 00 @xcite .",
    "there is now known to exist a broad range of jets from stellar - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "persistent compact jets with lengths of tens of a.u.are produced in the low / hard x - ray spectral state .",
    "impulsive jets produced at state transitions have been detected on lengths scales from hundreds of a.u .",
    "out to parsecs .",
    "stationary lobes have been found in the radio at separations of several parsecs for sources such as 1e1740.7 - 2942 and grs 1758 - 258 and in the x - ray with separations up to 70  pc from ss 433 @xcite .",
    "the jet size of 38  pc in 4u 175533 is larger than the transient large - scale moving jets of xte j1550 - 564 @xcite and h  1743@xmath57322 @xcite , but is similar to the total size of the stationary radio lobes of 1e1740.7 - 2942 and grs 1758 - 258 @xcite .",
    "the latter two sources are persistent x - ray emitters , similar in properties to 4u 175533 while it was x - ray bright .",
    "this may suggest that 4u 175533 represents the formation of a large - scale , nearly stationary jet .",
    "the central source in 4u 175533 has turned off and we now see the decay of the jet over a time scale of 1040 years or perhaps longer for the northern part of the jet . while we can place only a lower bound of 23 years on the time over which the central source was active , and the jet was being energized , our detection of the decay of the jet suggests that the time scale for the energization of the jet is similar to or shorter than the decay time .",
    "we note that we detect flux decay only for the southern jet .",
    "the change in morphology is also stronger for the inner regions of the southern jet .",
    "this may suggest that the southern jet is the approaching and the northern jet is receding .",
    "continued monitoring of 4u 175533 may reveal motion and decay of the northern jet .",
    "if the x - ray emission is thermal bremsstrahlung , then the total mass and energy of the jet can be estimated from its observed luminosity , temperature , and volume .",
    "for the volume , we assume that the jet occupies a roughly cylindrical volume with a diameter perpendicular to the direction of motion of @xmath69 and a linear dimension of @xmath70 multiplied by a filling factor of 0.2 .",
    "the volume is then @xmath71 for an assumed distance of 4  kpc .",
    "we took the flux from the x - ray spectral fits , and set @xmath72 which is the minimum temperature consistent with the fits .",
    "we find that the density of the jet material is @xmath73 , the total energy of the jet is @xmath74 and the total mass in the jet is @xmath75 .",
    "the cooling time of the gas would then be @xmath76 which is much longer than the observed decay time .",
    "also , if the jet were fed by the outflow from a mass accretion rate of @xmath77 corresponding the eddington rate for a @xmath78 compact object , at least @xmath79 years would be required to accumulate the needed mass .",
    "this is much longer than the observed decay time scale and we conclude that the jet emission is unlikely to be thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the best candidate source of seed photons for inverse - compton scattering is the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "the isrf varies strongly with galactocentric radius and height above the galactic plane . on the sky , 4u 1755 - 33",
    "is rather close to the galactic center and it could be physically close to the galactic center , although the low optical extinction suggests that the source is actually nearer than the galactic bulge .",
    "we assume that 4u 1755 - 33 is at a distance of 8.5  kpc , close to the galactic center , which maximizes the isrf energy density .",
    "we adopt an energy density of 10  ev  @xmath80 , equal to the maximum found anywhere in the milky way @xcite and assume , for simplicity , that all of the radiation is in the dominant component of isrf near 1  @xmath81 m @xcite . to produce x - rays in the 0.3 - 10  kev , electrons with energies from @xmath825 to @xmath82100  mev",
    "are required . for an assumed x - ray spectral index @xmath83 , defined as @xmath84 ,",
    "the total energy in relativistic electrons required is @xmath85 .",
    "a @xmath86 black hole producing energy at the eddington rate with all of the energy going to perfectly efficient acceleration of electrons in the desired energy range would require @xmath87 years to power the jet .",
    "this is much longer than the observed decay time scale .",
    "therefore , it appears unlikely that the jet emits via inverse - compton radiation .",
    "if x - ray emission is synchrotron , then synchrotron radio emission should be expected . to determine",
    "if our upper limits on the radio flux are consistent with synchrotron emission , we consider the emission from the brightest x - ray spot along the jet .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was extracted from a circle with a radius of @xmath44 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the radio beam size at 2.4  ghz , so we can compare the x - ray flux density in the regions to the radio upper limit per beam , which we take as 3 times the rms noise level of 0.2  mjy . comparing the x - ray and radio flux density , we derive a lower limit on the radio / x - ray spectral index @xmath2 , i.e. the spectrum must be flatter than @xmath88 . therefore , our radio observations may simply be not sensitive enough to detect the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "the limit on the spectral index implies that the exponent , @xmath89 , of the electron energy distribution , @xmath90 , must be @xmath91 .",
    "this is within the range that can be produced by relativistic shocks .",
    "the spectral index is similar to that measured for the large - scale jets of the black hole candidate x - ray transient xte j1550 - 564 of @xmath92 @xcite and consistent with the index of @xmath93 measured for the eastern lobe of ss 433 @xcite .",
    "to investigate the energetics of a jet radiating via synchrotron emission , we calculate the equipartition magnetic field . using a spectral index",
    "@xmath94 which is consistent with the bound above , a lower frequency cutoff of 2.4  ghz , and the same assumption for distance and volume as for the thermal bremsstrahlung case , we find a magnetic field of 36  @xmath81 g .",
    "the electrons producing the x - ray emission must have lorentz factors up to @xmath95 , corresponding to energies of up to 60 tev .",
    "the radiative lifetime of these electrons is of order 320  years .",
    "the minimum total energy required is @xmath96 and the number of electrons needed to produce the observed radiation is @xmath97 . assuming that the jet is composed of normal matter ( i.e.  roughly one proton per electron ) , then the required mass is @xmath98 .",
    "these numbers are relatively insensitive to distance . for a distance of 9  kpc ,",
    "the magnetic field decreases to 29  @xmath81 g , the required energy increases to @xmath99 , and the required mass increases to @xmath100 . for the larger distance",
    ", the energy required corresponds to 2 weeks accumulation at the eddington rate for a 10  @xmath101 black hole and the mass could be accumulated in less than one day .",
    "thus , the energy and material required for a synchrotron emitting jet could easily have been accumulated over the 20 year active phase of the x - ray source .",
    "using the decay rate calculated for the entire jet and the energy estimate from the synchrotron equipartition calculation , the energy loss rate is then @xmath102 for a 4  kpc distance .",
    "this is about 1% of the eddington luminosity for a 10  @xmath101 black hole and , therefore , the jet could have been energized by the conversion of a few percent of the energy into relativistic electrons .",
    "the available data on the jet of 4u 175533 are consistent with the x - rays being synchrotron emission .",
    "synchrotron emission also is the most favorable mechanism in terms of the required mass and energy .",
    "however , significantly deeper radio observations are required to test if the predicted synchrotron radio emission is produced .",
