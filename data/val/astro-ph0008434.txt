    ", obb determined @xmath15kpc .",
    "its proximity to the galactic center , reasonably low metallicity and small reddening make ngc 6652 somewhat unique .",
    "it is an inner halo globular cluster for which one can obtain an accurate relative age with respect to other halo clusters .    based upon its metallicity , radial velocity , hb type and position in the galaxy , @xcite classified ngc 6652 as an old halo cluster .",
    "this is at odds with obb s suggestion ( based on the turn - off magnitude ) that ngc 6652 is younger than the average halo cluster . because ngc 6652 is a compact cluster located in a crowded field , the photometry near the turn - off obtained by obb had a great deal of scatter leading to a large error in the age determination .",
    "for this reason , we were granted hst time to obtain a deep cmd of ngc 6652 , in order to clearly delineate the turn - off region and to obtain an accurate estimate of its age .",
    "the observations and data reduction procedure are presented in  [ obs ] and the generation of the isochrones used to determine the age of ngc 6652 is discussed in  [ theory ] .",
    "the analysis of the cmd is presented in ",
    "[ cmd ] , the discussion of the age of ngc 6652 is in  [ age ] , and the summary of the results are in  [ summ ] .",
    "ngc 6652 was observed in september 1997 with wfpc2 on hst .",
    "the cluster was centered on the pc1 chip .",
    "observations were obtained with the f555w ( v ) filter ( @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s ) and the f814w ( i ) filter ( @xmath18 s and @xmath17 s ) .",
    "the short exposure times were chosen to ensure good photometry at the level of the hb , while the long exposure times were picked to ensure good photometry around the turn - off and to allow for a good inter - comparison between the long and short exposure frames .",
    "figure [ figpict ] shows the averaged , long exposure f555w image of the cluster .",
    "the wfpc2 images of ngc 6652 were divided into three sets of four long exposure ( 160s ) f555w and f814w frames and one set of three short exposure f555w ( 23s ) and f814w ( 20s ) frames .",
    "each set of four long and three short exposures in a given filter was averaged using gcombine in iraf / stsdas with cosmic ray rejection enabled and the data quality files used to flag defective pixels .",
    "this yielded a total of 8 wfpc2 images which were input into our photometric procedure .",
    "we utilized the aperture photometry routines in daophot ii @xcite adopting an aperture radius of 2.5 pixels in the planetary camera and 2 pixels in the wide field chips .",
    "corrections from the small aperture photometry to the standard 0.5 arcsec radius were determined using 30 to 50 relatively uncrowded stars .",
    "these gave aperture corrections with typical standard deviations between 0.01 and 0.03 mag .",
    "the v and i instrumental magnitudes were matched to form colors , and corrected to a 0.5 arcsec radius aperture .",
    "the total instrumental magnitudes were then adjusted for exposure time and placed on the standard vi system using the coefficients in table 7 of @xcite .",
    "a correction was also applied for the well - known charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) problem using the formulation of @xcite .",
    "magnitudes of stars in common between the long exposure frames were averaged together and only stars measured on all three frame pairs were retained . the final photometry file contains stars fainter than v=17 from the long exposure frames and brighter than v=17 from the short exposures ( 4832 stars in total ) . in order to ensure that the long and short exposures magnitudes were internally consistent , the magnitude of a number of stars ( approximately 10 per chip ) in common between the long and short exposures were compared and the average offset determined .",
    "this average offset ( 0.03 mag ) was then applied to the short exposure magnitudes , implying that all of the magnitudes are on the long exposure scale .",
    "the photometry data is presented in table [ tabphot ] , the full version of which is available in the electronic version of this article .    due to its compact nature",
    ", the inner regions of ngc 6652 are crowded on the pc1 chip .",
    "the faint ( long exposure ) photometry within @xmath19 ( 250 pixels ) of the cluster center showed considerable scatter around the turn - off region .",
    "for this reason , the long exposure photometry in our final cmd only includes stars with @xmath20 from the cluster center .",
    "this trimmed data - set includes 3790 stars with good photometry .",
    "a careful inspection of the photometry obtained with the different chips showed no difference [ @xmath21 in the location of the principal features ( i.e.  location of the main sequence , sub - giant branch , red giant branch and the hb ) in the cmd .",
    "this indicates that the aperture corrections ( applied to each chip individually ) are accurate , implying that the internal errors in the photometry are very small .",
    "the external errors are set by the accuracy of the holtzman _",
    "( 1995 ) transformations to the standard system .",
    "stellar evolution tracks for masses in the range @xmath22 ( in @xmath23increments ) were calculated using the yale stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "these models incorporate the following physics : high temperature opacities from @xcite ; low temperature opacities from @xcite ; nuclear reaction rates from @xcite and @xcite ; helium diffusion coefficients from @xcite ; and an equation of state which includes the debye - hckel correction @xcite .",
    "note that this equation of state yields stellar models which are in good agreement with those derived using the opal equation of state @xcite .",
    "the surface boundary conditions were calculated using a grey @xmath24 relation .",
    "the stellar models employ a solar calibrated mixing length ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the models were typically evolved from the zero age main sequence to the upper giant branch ( around @xmath26 ) in 4000 time steps . in each time step , the stellar evolution equations were solved with a numerical accuracy exceeding 0.01% .",
    "the models did not include any overshooting beyond the formal edge of the convection zones .",
    "the heavy element composition of the models was chosen to reflect the observed abundance ratios in metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the @xmath27-capture elements ( o , mg , si , s , and ca ) and ti were enhanced by @xmath28dex , while mn was made to be deficient by the same proportions . the solar abundances ( before @xmath27-enhancement )",

    "thus , the helium abundance for the models was determined using @xmath33 there is some evidence that 47 tuc has a solar helium abundance @xcite . as 47 tuc",

    "the evidence for a solar helium abundance in 47 tuc is not strong , and indeed @xcite found @xmath36 from fitting the hb morphology .",
    "the isochrones were constructed by interpolating among the evolutionary tracks using the method of equal evolutionary points @xcite for the age range 6  18 gyr , in 1 gyr increments .",
    "the isochrones were transformed from the theoretical @xmath37 plane to observed colors and magnitudes using color transformations and bolometric corrections based on the @xcite model atmospheres .",
    "the transformations used here were kindly supplied to us by sukyoung yi ( private communication ) , who derived them for a wide range of metallicities , using a procedure similar to that described by @xcite . at solar metallicities ,",
    "the yi tables agree with @xcite table 1 to within @xmath380.007 mag in  and @xmath380.004 in  over the range of colors appropriate for old clusters . in the yi tables ,",

    "@xcite extensively tested their kurucz - based ( atlas9 ) colors for solar metallicities , and found that all indices agreed extremely well with observations for @xmath41k ( 4250k corresponds to @xmath42 at @xmath4$}}= -0.85 $ ] ) .",
    "@xcite recently studied the issue of color transformations for isochrones in the vi - plane .",
    "they concluded that on the main sequence the color transformations based on the atlas9 models were a good choice . on the giant branch @xcite preferred to use empirical color relations .",
    "however , an inspection of their figure 5 indicates that the color transformation based upon the atlas9 models is in good agreement with the empirical relations preferred by @xcite .",
    "thus it appears that our choice of the yi color table is a reasonable one , in good agreement with presently available data .",
    "figure [ figiso ] displays the 12 gyr isochrones for the various compositions used in this paper .",
    "it is interesting to note that changing the helium abundance from @xmath35 ( given by eqn.([yeqn ] ) ) to the solar value ( @xmath34 ) , has very little effect on the isochrone .",
    "thus , the exact choice of @xmath43 will not effect the derived ages .",
    "in contrast , changing the @xmath44 $ ] ratio by @xmath45dex has a substantial effect on the isochrones ( larger than changing  by @xmath46dex ) and so the uncertainty in the actual value of @xmath47 $ ] in ngc 6652 will lead to a substantial uncertainty in the derived age .    in  [ isofit ] ,",
    "the isochrones are fit to the cmd of ngc 6652 .",
    "this fitting procedure assumes that the location of the unevolved main sequence predicted by the theoretical isochrones is accurate . to test this assumption ,",
    "the hipparcos catalogue was searched for stars which ( a ) have @xmath48 , ( b ) are fainter than @xmath49 , and ( c ) are not known or suspected hipparcos binaries or variables .",
    "this resulted in a list of 2618 stars , of which the great majority have near solar metallicity .",
    "as we are interested in stars with a similar metallicity to ngc 6652 , we require stars with @xmath50$}}\\la -0.65 $ ] . to identify these metal - poor stars in the hipparcos sample ,",
    "we have cross identified the above hipparcos subsample with the 1996 high resolution spectroscopic catalogue of @xcite , and more recent papers which give high dispersion abundance analysis of metal - poor stars : @xcite .",
    "any stars which were known or suspected binaries and whose companions would contribute a significant flux in the bvi passbands were removed from our final list . in total only 3 stars in the hipparcos catalogue",
    "pass our stringent selection criteria .",
    "a comparison between these stars and our isochrones is shown in figure [ fighipp ] .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to locate kron - cousins  colors for these stars , so the comparison is only shown in .",
    "the small number of stars prevents us from reaching any definitive conclusions based upon this comparison .",

    "further support that our isochrones correctly predict the location of the unevolved main sequence comes from the following additional tests : ( 1 ) a comparison between single field stars with good parallaxes from hipparcos and our isochrones found good agreement between @xmath52$}}\\le -1.0 $ ] @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) with no adjustable parameters , our isochrones provide a good match to the main sequence of the hyades ( @xmath4$}}= + 0.15 $ ] ) derived from hipparcos parallaxes @xcite , and ( 3 ) we are using a solar calibrated mixing length which implies our models are in good agreement with main sequence solar metallicity stars .",
    "clearly , these tests are not definitive as the number of single , metal - poor stars with well determined parallaxes is relatively small .",
    "however , these tests do show that the isochrones are not in gross disagreement with the observations , and suggest that at the level of @xmath53 , the isochrones correctly predict the location of the unevolved main sequence in relatively metal - poor stars ( @xmath52$}}\\le 0.65 $ ] ) .",
    "the ( @xmath54 ) cmd for ngc 6652 obtained from the hst data is shown in figure [ figcmd ] . as discussed in  [ obs ] , data from the long exposures ( @xmath55 ) does not include stars with @xmath19 .",
    "the cmd clearly delineates the major evolutionary sequences from @xmath1 mag below the turn - off to @xmath56 mag above the hb .",
    "an inspection of the cmd leads to the following values : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "all errors are estimated internal errors , which reflect the scatter of the photometry .",
    "the magnitude of the hb was estimated at the mid - point in the color of the hb ( around @xmath64 ) .",
    "the point @xmath65 was defined by @xcite to be the magnitude of the point on the sub - giant branch which is 0.05 mag redder than the turn - off . as discussed by @xcite",
    "it is an excellent age indicator for old stellar systems .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented an homogeneous catalog of hb parameters .",
    "they stress that due to the rapid evolution away from the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) , the observed lower envelope of the hb does not coincide with the zahb from theoretical models .",
    "the @xmath66 level reported above is the lower envelope of the observations . using their theoretical hb models",
    ", @xcite determined that a correction of @xmath67 mag needs to be applied to the observed lower envelope of the ngc 6652 hb . if such a correction is necessary in our dataset then @xmath68 using the methodology of @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath69 ) cmd of obb shows considerable scatter around the turn - off , so it is difficult to compare our photometry to that of obb at the fainter magnitudes .",
    "however , it is possible to compare our photometry around the level of the hb .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure [ figort ] . from this figure , it is clear that the level of the zahb is @xmath70 mag fainter in the photometry of obb as compared to the photometry presented in this paper .",
    "in addition , the color of the red giant branch ( rgb ) at the level of the hb as found by obb is 0.08 mag bluer than the rgb color in our photometry .",
    "the reason(s ) for these differences is unclear .",
    "the differences are considerably larger than our estimated errors due to the aperture corrections , and are larger than the estimated errors in the hst @xmath54 calibration . to investigate this further , f439w and f555w ( b , v ) go 6095 observations",
    "@xcite were retrieved from the hst archive and the data were reduced in exactly the same manner as was done with our v ,  data .",
    "the results of this comparison are plotted in figure [ ortbv ] . from this",
    ", one can see that the b  v rgbs are in better agreement between the two datasets than those in v ",
    "there is a slight offset in the level of the zahb , with the obb photometry being _ brighter _ than the hst photometry . from the obb  data , we obtained @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( color of the rgb at the level of the hb ) . from the vi data presented by obb , we find @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the disagreement between the level of the hb in the   and   datasets suggests that the obb data is not internally consistent . in the  and  hst data",
    ", the level of the hb agrees to within 0.01 mag .",
    "in addition , obb found @xmath75 .",
    "in general , the  color is redder than the  color .",
    "our isochrones show this trend , as does the observational transformation for globular cluster giant branches from  to presented by @xcite . from the hst data , we find @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the @xcite transformation applied to the hst  data implies @xmath78 in good agreement with the measured value .",
    "finally , we note that obb determined a brighter turn - off magnitude , @xmath79 and found @xmath80 .",
    "these values differ by @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively from the values obtained with our photometry .",
    "as the turn - off magnitude is a primary age indicator , the fainter turn - off found in our photometry implies an older age for ngc 6652 .",
    "a variety of methods may be used to determine the age of a globular cluster , each with their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "perhaps the simplest method is to fit an isochrone to the data by adjusting the distance modulus and reddening ( within their known uncertainties ) such that the mean locus of observed points is matched to the theoretical isochrone . due to uncertainties in surface boundary conditions , color - effective temperature transformations and the treatment of convection",
    ", the colors of the isochrones may be in error .",
    "this is particularly true on the rgb , where a modest change in the choice of the mixing length can lead to a large change in the predicted rgb colors .",
    "for this reason , when fitting the isochrones to the data only the main sequence and turn - off regions were used in the fit .",
    "such a fit is shown in figure [ figfit1 ] for our @xmath4$}}= -0.85 $ ] , @xmath47 = + 0.4 $ ] isochrones .",
    "the best fitting isochrone has an age of 13 gyr .",
    "the best fit distance modulus ( @xmath83 ) implies @xmath84 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the distance modulus derived using the preferred  relation given by @xcite which implies @xmath85 at the metallicity of ngc 6652 .",
    "the best fit reddening of @xmath86 corresponds to @xmath87 and is in reasonable agreement with the value obtained by obb ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the @xcite reddening maps based on iras / dirbe dust emission yield @xmath88 for ngc 6652 , also in good agreement .    when performing main sequence fitting , there is considerable degeneracy between the derived distance modulus and the reddening .",
    "for example , changing the reddening to @xmath89 , leads to a derived distance modulus of @xmath90 and an age of 15 gyr . assuming an uncertainty of the reddening of @xmath91 mag leads to an uncertainty in the derived distance modulus of @xmath92 mag and in the age of @xmath93 gyr . in fitting the isochrones to the data ,",
    "the degeneracy between the distance modulus and reddening was broken by examining the region around the turn - off and the sub - giant branch to obtain the best fit shown in figure [ figfit1 ] .",
    "this allows us to determine our preferred values for the age and distance modulus , but it is important to realize that the error in these best fit parameters are rather large .",
    "the implicit assumption in this fitting procedure is that the location of the unevolved main sequence predicted by the theoretical isochrones is accurate .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been discussed at the end of  [ theory ] , where we conclude that at the level of @xmath53 mag the isochrones correctly predict the location of the unevolved main sequence in relatively metal - poor stars ( @xmath94$}}\\le 0.6 $ ] ) .",
    "combining the uncertainty in the theoretical location of the unevolved main sequence with the uncertainty in our fitting procedure due to errors in the reddening leads us to conclude that the age and distance modulus we derive from isochrone fitting are accurate to @xmath95 and @xmath96mag respectively .",
    "fits of the isochrones with the various compositions discussed in  [ theory ] were also performed . in all cases , the fits in the turn - off , sub - giant branch and rgb regions were considerably inferior to the fit shown in figure [ figfit1 ] which uses our best estimate for the composition ( @xmath4$}}= -0.85 $ ] ; @xmath47 = + 0.4 $ ] ) . the best fitting parameters for the various isochrone fits are shown in table [ tabisofit ] .",
    "given that the other compositions gave inferior fits to the data , we prefer to take as our central values those found from the isochrones with the best estimate for the compositions . taking into account the uncertainty in the reddening , along with the variation in derived parameters shown in table [ tabisofit ] , isochrone fitting implies the following parameters for ngc 6652 @xmath97 , @xmath3 and an age of @xmath98gyr .",
    "due to uncertainties in the theoretical models and the reddening of ngc 6652 , the age we derive based upon isochrone fitting has a relatively large error .",
    "the isochrone fitting procedure serves as a first order test of our models ( ensuring they are in reasonable agreement with the observations ) and allows us to determine the age of the cluster which is independent of the hb .",
    "a more robust determination of the cluster s age may be found using the difference in magnitude of the point on the sub - giant branch which is @xmath99 mag redder than the turn - off and the hb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* referred to as ) .",

    "this correction was determined using the theoretical hb models of @xcite . from this procedure",
    ", we obtain an age of @xmath102gyr , where the error includes a @xmath103dex uncertainty in , the observational error in determining , and the error in our adopted  calibration .",
    "this may be compared to an age of @xmath104 gyr which was found from isochrone fitting .",
    "this age difference of @xmath105 gyr is well within our errors . from the theoretical point of view ,  is a more robust age indicator than isochrone fitting as it does not depend critically on the ( uncertain ) colors of the theoretical models @xcite .",
    "thus , we prefer the use of the  age indicator .",
    "ignoring the error in the zero - point calibration of our  relation gives a precise _ relative _ age for ngc 6652 of @xmath106gyr .",
    "the above relative age may be compared to other clusters with a similar metallicity .",
    "for example , there exists excellent photometry of the thick disk globular cluster 47 tuc from @xcite .",
    "this cluster has a well established metallicity of @xmath4$}}= -0.71 $ ] on both the @xcite and @xcite scales , which is 0.14 dex more metal - rich than our preferred  for ngc 6652 .",

    "the electronic data of @xcite was used to determine @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "these values were determined in exactly the same manner as for ngc 6652 .",

    "this is virtually identical to the age derived for ngc 6652 . to the precision of the data ,",
    "the two clusters have the same age to within @xmath114gyr .",

    ", @xcite found a  age of @xmath115gyr for 47 tuc implying that 47 tuc is @xmath116gyr older than ngc 6652 .",
    "if 47 tuc has a solar helium abundance , the absolute magnitude of the hb would be different than what has been assumed , implying that the derived age would be altered .",
    "@xcite found that increasing the helium abundance by 0.019 to ( their ) solar value decreased the estimated age of 47 tuc by 1.1 gyr .",
    "this difference in helium abundance between our solar value and that implied by eqn .",
    "( [ yeqn ] ) is 0.0177 , and so if 47 tuc has a solar helium abundance the  age we determined should be decreased by 1.0 gyr .",
    "this would imply that the ngc 6652 is @xmath117gyr older than 47 tuc .",
    "thus , allowing for differences in the @xmath47 $ ] or in the helium abundance between the two clusters does not change our conclusion that , to the precision of the data , ngc 6652 and 47 tuc are the same age .",
    "this lack of age difference between 47 tuc and ngc 6652 implies that the formation of the thick disk overlapped with the formation of the inner halo .    at the suggestions of the referee",
