    "if the neutrino has a majorana nature , the neutrino less double beta ( @xmath3 ) decay exists in some natural isotopes including @xmath0xe . the observation of this hypothetical decay would prove physics beyond the standard model as the neutrino being its own anti - particle and the lepton number violation .",
    "in addition , the measurement of its lifetime would allow to estimate the absolute neutrino masses and to determine the hierarchy of the neutrino mass states .",
    "next-100 is currently under construction and will search for the @xmath3 decay at the canfranc underground laboratory  @xcite .",
    "it consists of an electroluminescent high pressure ( up to 15 bar ) time projection chamber that will use up to 150 kg of gaseous xenon enriched in the isotope @xmath0xe to @xmath4 % as both the source of the decay and the detection medium .    in the gaseous phase the fluctuations associated with the production of primary electrons by ionizing particles are very low when compared to those of the liquid phase ( @xmath5130 times higher )  @xcite . taking advantage of this and using electroluminescence ( el ) as a nearly noiseless signal amplification process  @xcite allows one to achieve outstanding energy resolution , which plays an important role in separating the rare signal from natural background decays that are close in energy .",
    "in addition , the extended ionization tracks left behind by the two high energy electrons from the decay ( @xmath6 cm long at 10 bar ) enable the suppress of background by performing topology recognition of the `` spaghetti with two meat - balls '' signature  @xcite .",
    "for further details about next-100 , its working principle and its physics potential please see references  @xciteand  @xcite .    as part of the r&d program of the next experiment ,",
    "two prototypes were constructed : next - demo and next - dbdm .",
    "both prototypes have a similar working principle ( and similar to that of next-100 ) but the studies performed in each one focused on different issues .",
    "unlike next-100 , the two prototypes are not intended to be radiopure neither shielded from natural radioactivity . in this paper",
    "we summarize the latest results from both prototypes regarding gas purity stability , light collection , energy resolution and tracking capabilities .",
    "detailed analyses are available in references  @xcite and  @xcite for next - demo and next - dbdm , respectively .",
    "when incoming particles interact inside the detector , they ionize and excite atoms of the gas .",
    "excitations produce a prompt and fast light ( 172 nm ) pulse  called s@xmath7  that , after being detected by an array of photomultipliers ( pmts ) , works as a _ start - of - event _ signal .",
    "the free electrons are then under effect of a drift field that helps them to escape recombination while they drift towards a region ",
    "the el gap  where they are accelerated by a stronger electric field and excite but not ionize xenon atoms , which then de - excite producing secondary light ( also 172 nm ) .",
    "this process is called _ electroluminescence _ ( el ) and , being detected by the array of pmts , this light gives information about the energy of the incident particle  the s@xmath8 signal .",
    "el is also detected by a 2d array of light sensitive detectors ( pmts in the case of next - demo and sipms in the case of next - dbdm ) that lives just next to the el gap . by time slicing the waveforms coming from those devices , it is possible to image in 3d the original ionization track . as an example of the acquired raw data , fig .",

    "next - demo was constructed and operated at the instituto de fsica corpuscular ( valencia , spain ) . the energy plane consists of an array of 19 r7378a pmts from hamamatsu with 1  quartz windows , resistant to pressure up to 20 bar and with a quantum efficiency ( qe ) of about 20 % .",

    "a similar array was installed 2 mm away from the anode for coarse tracking .",
    "the drift region is 30 cm long and has an hexagonal cross - section with a 14.4 cm long internal diagonal .",
    "the length to diameter ratio of the el light detected by the energy plane is @xmath12 .",

    "high gas purity was achieved , as confirmed by the smallness of the required corrections for attachment to the measured energy , in the range 1 - 3 % for the whole 30 cm long drift region , depending on whether the walls of the detector were coated or uncoated .",
    "a drift field of @xmath15 v@xmath16 and an el field of 2.4 kv@xmath16bar@xmath17 were used for both sets of data .",

    "1.7  % fwhm is achieved , in agreement with the expected scaling due to the increase in the photon statistics .",
    "this shows that after calibration , the contributions to the energy response of the detector are well understood .",

    "the drift region is 8 cm long with an hexagonal cross section of 14.4 cm diameter .",
    "the length to diameter associated with the el light is @xmath24 , optimizing light collection .",
    "this allowed us to perform detailed energy response studies envisaging nearly intrinsic resolutions .",
    "the results reported in this document refer to events produced by a 1 mci @xmath25cs 662 kev gamma - ray source , after being strongly collimated and directed along the axis of the chamber .",
    "xenon at room temperate and pressures of 10 and 15 bar was used , recirculating through a hot getter from johnson matthey ( model pureguard ) for purification .",
    "high quality pure xenon was achieved , indicated by the long electronic life times : @xmath26 ms for 10 bar and @xmath27 ms for 15 bar .",
    "this means that less than 1 % of the primary electrons were lost through attachment along the whole 8 cm long drift region .",
    "drift fields in the range of 10 - 120 v@xmath16bar@xmath17 were scanned without significant changes in the obtained energy resolution .",
    "el amplification fields between 1.0 and 2.5 kv@xmath16bar@xmath17 were also scanned and good consistency of the amount of el light dependency on the field was found for both pressures .",
    "results reported in this section correspond to runs taken without a dedicated tracking plane . however , a rough @xmath28 reconstructed position of the events was possible using the energy pmt plane , with resolutions of @xmath29 mm for central 30 kev x - ray depositions .",

    "[ fig : nextdbdm_enres_resume ] summarises our knowledge about the energy response in the next - dbdm prototype .",
    "the energy resolution dependence on the amount of detected light in an electroluminescent tpc is described by four contributions .",
    "the first is the gas intrinsic energy resolution given by the fano factor  @xcite and the energy of the incoming particle , @xmath34 for our conditions .",
    "it is represented in the plot by the two horizontal lines , for 30 kev x - rays and 662 kev gamma - rays respectively .",
    "the process of el amplification is a nearly noiseless process and thus does not contribute significantly to the energy resolution degradation  @xcite .",
    "the conversion of photons into photoelectrons in the pmts photocathode follow a poisson distribution represented by the lower diagonal line .",
    "the upper diagonal line shows the expected response when including the variance in the pmt response to single photoelectrons , which we determined previously .",
    "the data points taken with a pulsed led ( circles ) follow that trend .    summing all the contributions",
    "one gets the two curved lines , respectively for 30 and 662 kev depositions .",
    "the data points follow the expected tendency but are larger than the expected form ( 20 - 30 % in the case of 662 kev gammas ) possibly due to the @xmath28 response non - uniformity .",
    "it is expected that a dense tracking array as that recently installed in the prototype , which preliminary results are presented in section  [ subsec : tracking ] , will allow one to map that non - uniformity and correct the detector response , further enhancing the energy resolution .          in this section ,",
