    "moore s law of microelectronics ( currently still valid since more than 40 years ) states that one should expect a doubling of cpu performance every 18 to 24 months . while high - density magnetic storage is advancing ( over the long term ) at a rate similar to moore s law ,",
    "rates surpassing moore s law were recently observed .    when bit density @xmath0 gets larger , bit length that scales as @xmath1 gets smaller at a rate that recently reached almost the double value of the microelectronics feature size rate . in the latter case ,",
    "a bit is stored as an electronic charge as in flash memory , flip - flops , registers and cache memory ( the charge can also be periodically refreshed as in capacitor based random access memories d - ram ) , while in mass storage magnetic media ( disk , floppy , tape ... ) a bit corresponds to a well defined orientation of magnetization and is usually stored within many ferromagnetic grains possessing an average orientation .    when the typical bit size shrinks , we get closer to the limit where one magnetic grain is able of holding a single bit of information . this is the realm of nanometer electronics ( nanoelectronics ) and spin electronics ( spintronics ) .",
    "spintronics is a new field of electronics with the coexistence of classical materials used in standard electronics ( metals , semiconductors and insulators ) and magnetic materials ( ferromagnetic , anti - ferromagnetic , ferrimagnetic , paramagnetic , diamagnetic etc ... ) .",
    "the goal of spintronics  @xcite is to make novel devices that are controlled by the combined actions of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "a spintronic device has an additional degree of freedom with respect to a standard device controlled by charge only ; it has also a polarization ( or a magnetic state : up or down in the transverse technology and right left in the longitudinal case ) .",
    "transverse and longitudinal technologies refer to perpendicular or parallel to the direction set by the media mechanical rotation velocity ( disk or floppy ) .",
    "+ in an ordinary p - n junction diode , the total current is obtained from electronic @xmath2 and hole @xmath3 charge densities , whereas in a spin polarised diode , the current is composed of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; hence spin degrees of freedom @xmath8 play a role in addition to charge . + a magnetic memory such as",
    "an mram retains any information stored ( being of magnetic type ) even when the system is powered down ( or hangs up ) in contrast to electronic ram s and registers ( since information is of electronic type ) .",
    "that means , in a pc containing mram s the operating system is loaded once for all ( at first boot ) and if the system hangs or is powered down , all temporary information is preserved .",
    "additionally the magnetic polarization degree of freedom can lead to new devices of interest in quantum computing , communication and storage devices , so called quantum information devices .",
    "+ the stoner - wohlfarth ( sw ) model of ferromagnetism is the simplest model that is adequate to describe the physics of tiny magnetic grains containing single magnetic domains .",
    "it can be considered as a sort of hydrogen model of ferromagnetism .",
    "the physics of the sw model is built on a series of assumptions that ought to be placed into perspective in order to highlight and understand the progress and insight in magnetism and magnetic materials .",
    "+ this redux is made of two parts : the first tackles the static properties and the second the dynamic and statistical properties ( dynamics of the magnetization reversal under either temperature or a time dependent magnetic field ) . +",
    "this part is organised as follows : section 2 describes the basics of the stoner- wohlfarth model .",
    "section 3 describes the hysteresis curves associated with the model .",
    "section 4 details the energetics of the sw model ( nature of the energy barrier to cross when there is a change in magnetization state ) .",
    "finally , section 5 discusses some of the limitations of the model .",
    "a fm used typically in recording media ( hard disks , floppies , tapes  ) can be considered as made of a large number of interacting magnetic moments ( on the order of @xmath9 the avogadro number for a mole of material ) .",
    "+ when a magnetic field is applied to a fm , a magnetization change takes place .",
    "one way to understand the underlying phenomena is to plot the value of the magnetization @xmath10 projected along the direction of the applied field @xmath11 .",
    "the locus of the magnetization @xmath10 measured along the direction of the applied magnetic field @xmath12 versus the field and depicted in the @xmath13 plane is the hysteresis loop ( see fig .",
    "[ hyster ] ) .",
    "the term hysteresis ( delay in greek ) means that when the material is field cycled ( i.e. the field @xmath11 is increased then decreased ) two different non - overlapping curves ( `` ascending and descending branches '' ) @xmath12 are obtained .",
    "the main characteristics of the hysteresis loop are the saturation magnetization @xmath14 ( saturation is attained when all the magnetic moments are aligned along some common direction resulting in the largest value of the magnetization ) , the remanent magnetization @xmath15 ( the leftover magnetization i.e. magnetization when the field @xmath16 is the basis of zero - cost information storage with @xmath17 orientations representing a single bit . ) and the coercive field @xmath18 ( which makes @xmath19 , i.e. the field such that @xmath20 ) and the anisotropy field @xmath21 . the hysteresis loop might be viewed as a sort of magnetic @xmath22 characteristic ( @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath24 and @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) .",
    "the characteristic is non - linear and the output @xmath24 is delayed with respect to input @xmath26 .",
    "the input - output delay is proportional to the width of the loop .",
    "the ratio @xmath27 called squareness is close to 1 when the applied magnetic field is close to some orientation defined as the easy axis ( ea  @xcite ) and the hysteresis loop is closest to a square shape . once the ea is determined , the angle the magnetic field makes with the ea ( say @xmath28 ) is varied and the hysteresis loop is graphed for different angles ( see fig .  [ grain ] ) .",
    "when the angle @xmath29 is increased the opening of the hysteresis loop is reduced ; it is largest when the magnetic field is most parallel to the ea and smallest when the magnetic field is most parallel to the so called hard axis ( in simple systems the hard axis is perpendicular to the ea ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hyster ] , most characteristics of the hysteresis loop are depicted and for a given temperature and frequency of the applied field @xmath26 , quantities such as the remanent magnetization @xmath30 , and the coercive field @xmath18 depend on the angle @xmath29 .",
    "+ when temperature or field frequency are varied , the hysteresis loop shape changes and may even be seriously altered by the frequency of the field .",
    "the hysteresis loop branches might collapse altogether over a single curve above a given temperature ( curie temperature ) , the material becoming paramagnetic and therefore unable to store information .",
    "+ the sw model ( also called coherent rotation  @xcite ) considers a fm as represented by a single magnetic moment ( thus the name coherent as in optics for fixed phase relationship or as in a superconductor where a single wavefunction represents all electrons in the material ) . the material is therefore considered as a single magnetic domain , thus all domain related effects or inhomogeneities are not considered .",
    "a single domain occurs when the size of the grain is smaller than some length termed the critical radius ( see subsection ii - a ) and contains about 10@xmath31 - 10@xmath32 atoms , typically .",
    "+ at @xmath33 a grain carrying a single moment @xmath10 , is an ellipsoid - shaped object ( see fig .",
    "[ grain ] ) since a material with uniform magnetization ought to have an ellipsoid form @xcite .",
    "+ the grain possesses a uniaxial anisotropy ( meaning an axis along which the magnetization prefers to lie in order to minimize the energy ) and is subjected to an externally applied static magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 evolves strictly in a two dimensional space ( see fig .  [ grain ] ) , therefore it is characterized by a single angle @xmath34 , the angle @xmath10 makes with the anisotropy axis ( also the ea , in this case  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the angle the external applied magnetic field ( taken as the @xmath35-axis ) makes with the ea .",
    "+ thus , the moment @xmath10 is subjected to two competing alignment forces : one is due to a uniaxial anisotropy characterised by @xmath36 favoring some direction ( see fig .  [ grain ] ) and the other is due to an external magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the total energy is the anisotropy energy @xmath37 and the zeeman energy @xmath38 . at @xmath33 , the energy ( per unit volume  @xcite ) is then : @xmath39 the anisotropy energy  @xcite @xmath40 is minimum ( = 0 ) when @xmath41 for @xmath42 ( see note  @xcite ) .",
    "the moment will select a direction such that the total energy @xmath43 is minimized .",
    "the orientation change might occur smoothly ( rotation ) or suddenly ( switching ) implying that the magnetization is discontinous at some value of the magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "+ a fm of a finite size ( like the ellipsoidal grain ) magnetized uniformly ( the magnetization @xmath10 is represented by its components @xmath44 contains a magnetic energy ( called also magnetostatic energy  @xcite ) given by @xmath45 ( einstein summation is considered ) .",
    "the @xmath46 coefficients are the demagnetization coefficients of the body determined by its shape .",
    "the origin of the terminology is due to the resemblance to the familiar anisotropy energy  @xcite of the form @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficients depend on the geometry of the material . for simple symmetric geometries ,",
    "one has three positive coefficients along three directions @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( the off - diagonal terms are all 0 ) .",
    "this is the case of wires , disks , thin films and spheres .",
    "all three coefficients are positive , smaller than 1 and their sum is equal to 1 . for a sphere , all three coefficients are equal to @xmath51 . for a disk they are given by 0,0,1 if the @xmath35 axis is perpendicular the disk lying in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "for an infinite length cylindrical wire with its axis lying along the @xmath35 direction , the values are @xmath53  @xcite . +",
    "a fm ( assumed to possess a single uniform magnetization @xmath24 even though it does not have an ellipsoid shape ) cut in the form of a cylinder , disk or a thin film possessing a uniaxial anisotropy can be considered as having the anisotropy energy @xmath54 with @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we add to anisotropy the demagnetization energy @xmath55 ( due to the body finite size along one or several directions ) , we get a competition between the two energies : @xmath56 this yields : @xmath57 \\sin ^2\\theta + \\mbox {   const.}\\ ] ]    the indices @xmath58 of the demagnetization coefficients denote respectively parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath35 axis .",

    "one observes that despite the wide variability of the energy landscape versus @xmath34 , a couple of points are not affected by @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , the landscape becomes quite flat for some value of @xmath67 .",
    "+ the minimum condition at @xmath62 is : @xmath68    normalizing the magnetization by its saturation value , such that @xmath69 , yields :    @xmath70_{\\theta=\\theta^ * }   & = 0   \\\\",

    "+ in order to present the possible solutions , we define two components of the magnetization :    1 .   the longitudinal magnetization i.e. the projection of @xmath10 along @xmath11 , @xmath72 .",
    "the transverse magnetization i.e. the projection of @xmath10 perpendicularly to @xmath11 , @xmath73 .",

    "+ the questions that arise are then :    * what are the conditions for expecting a stoner particle behaviour ?",
    "* is there some characteristic size below which a single domain is expected ?",
    "attempt at answering the above are discussed next .",
    "when a magnetic medium is made of non - interacting grains , there is possibility for observing stoner particle behaviour ( single domain ) when the typical size of the grain is below the critical radius @xmath82 of the grain .",
    "a simple argument given in landau - lifshitz _ electrodynamics of continuous media _",
    "@xcite is based on the following : when the demagnetization energy  @xcite @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is the demagnetization coefficient along some preferred axis , usually the long one in an ellipsoid - shaped grain ) is equal to the exchange energy  @xcite @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the exchange stiffness constant along @xmath88 directions ) .",
    "+ considering that @xmath89 a typical exchange stiffness constant ( regardless of @xmath88 ) results in @xmath90 .",
    "exchange energy is the largest contribution to non - uniformity energy due to spatial variation of the magnetization @xmath10 .",
    "+ when the change in the direction of @xmath10 occurs over distances that are large compared to interatomic distances , non - uniformity energy can be expressed with derivatives of @xmath10 with respect to spatial coordinates ( see landau - lifshitz  @xcite and brown  @xcite ) .",
    "exchange stiffness constant @xmath86 is on the order of heisenberg exchange energy per unit length @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is the average nearest neighbour distance within the grain ) .",

    ", we infer that for elongated grains made of iron , nickel or cobalt , @xmath82 is within a few 100 nm range .",
    "applying a magnetic field @xmath11 to a fm and measuring a resulting magnetization @xmath10 as a response can be considered as a classical signal input - output problem .",
    "the input - output characteristic @xmath12 is that of a peculiar non - linear filter except at very low fields where @xmath10 is simply proportional to @xmath11 . a simple illustration of non - linearity is to observe the output as a square signal whereas the input is a sinusoidal excitation ( see ref .",
    "in addition , the material imposes a propagation delay to the signal proportional to the width of the hysteresis loop ( twice the coercive field ) . + hysteretic behaviour is generally exploited in control systems , for instance , because different values of the output are required as the input excitation is varied in an increasing or decreasing fashion .",
    "we consider two types of hysteresis curves , as mentioned in the previous section :    1 .   a longitudinal hysteresis curve with the reduced magnetization @xmath99 taken along the direction of the applied external magnetic field ( see fig .  [ vsm ] ) .",
    "2 .   a transverse hysteresis curve with the reduced magnetization @xmath100 taken along the direction perpendicular to the applied external field ( see fig .  [ rtm ] ) .    as an illustration , the hysteresis loop depicted in fig .",
    "[ hyster ] , is found by calculating the component of @xmath10 along @xmath11 from the set of @xmath101 angles at a given angle @xmath29 , that minimize the energy @xmath102 ( conditions given in eq .",
    "[ eq : min ] )",

    "+ the critical field ( called henceforth switching field ) for which the magnetization value jumps from one energy minimum to another equivalent to the first is denoted @xmath113 .",
    "we use the @xmath114 index referring to switching in order to distinguish @xmath113 from the coercive field @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "[ criths ] ) .",
    "+ depending on the shape of the hysteresis loop , there are two cases to consider :    1 .",
    "derivative case : @xmath113 may be considered as an external magnetic field for which the absolute derivative @xmath116 diverges or is very large , meaning that we have @xmath117 .",

    "@xmath120 is the energy with @xmath121 the magnetization in the first minimum state ( resp . in the second state ) .",
    "the above conditions insure the magnetization jumps from one minimum to another .",
    "the nulling of energy angle derivatives ( first and second ) yields a flat energy behaviour versus angle ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : switching ] ) facilitating such jumping ( see note  @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ criths ] the switching field @xmath113 versus angle @xmath28 is displayed showing the minimum field to reverse the magnetization , being half the anisotropy field , must be applied with an angle of 135 @xmath64(90@xmath64 + 45@xmath64 ) with respect to the ea .",
    "the critical magnetization is the magnetization at @xmath113 and can be evaluated from the critical angle : @xmath122}^{1/3}$ ] .",

    "it is interesting to examine the behaviour of the energy barrier separating two magnetization states with an applied field . a deep understanding of the nature of the barrier , its characteristics and how it is altered by material composition ,",
    "field or temperature will help us control and finely tune the behaviour of magnetic states inside a fm .",
    "some of the questions one might ask are the following :    1 .",
    "what are the exact characteristics of the energy barrier @xmath125 ?",
    "2 .   does @xmath125 vary with the nature and shape of the magnetic grain ?",
    "3 .   how does @xmath125 vary with an external applied field ? 4 .   if there is some interaction between grains , how does it affect the barrier height ?",
    "first of all , the energy barrier is defined as the minimum energy separating two neighbouring energy minima ( one of them being a local minimum ) .",
    "the applied field modifies the shape of the energy barrier as depicted in fig .",
    "[ energy ] leading to consider at least two field choices ( @xmath126 or @xmath113 ) , i.e : @xmath127 or @xmath128 where @xmath125 is normalised by the effective anisotropy constant .",

    "[ expohs ] .",
    "the often quoted exponent @xmath129 is valid only when @xmath130 .",
    "moreover we observe that when we normalize the applied field with respect to @xmath126 ( fig .  [ expohk ] ) the curvature is opposite to what is observed in the @xmath113 normalization case ( fig .",
    "[ expohs ] ) .",
    "again the often cited exponent 2 is valid only when @xmath130 exactly as in the @xmath126 normalization case .",

    "[ expohs ] indicates that this approximation is not so bad when compared to our exact numerical calculation .",
    "+ when an assembly of interacting grains are considered , it is possible to recast the barrier formula in a form similar to the non - interacting stoner particle case , however , the nature of the interaction between the grains and the way it is accounted for will determine the value of the exponent .",
    "the sw model is a macrospin approach to magnetic systems ( like `` coarse - graining '' in statistical physics , or ehrenfest approach in quantum systems ) because of the complexity of a direct microscopic ( nanoscopic being more appropriate ) description .",
    "its main concern is single domain physics despite the fact magnetic materials , in general , possess a multi - domain structure .",
    "regardless of this consideration , several limitations are already built into the sw model .",
    "one limitation is the crossover problem indicating that hysteresis branches may cross for certain values of the angle @xmath28 .",
    "a crossing ( crossover ) between the two branches occurs at @xmath136 when @xmath137 . solving this equation , we obtain @xmath138 yielding @xmath139 .",
    "the crossing angle is defined as the angle for which the field @xmath136 is equal to the switching field , that is for an angle @xmath140 satisfying :              the branch crossing problem has been observed in the sw work but no remedy was offered .",
    "one may slightly modify the expression of the branches for large @xmath28 angles as done in the work of stancu and chiorescu @xcite .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy of the grain appeals to materials such as cobalt , whereas other transition metal fm s such as iron or nickel possess cubic anisotropy .",
    "other types of anisotropy occur as discussed in the second part of this work .",
    "+ several other limitations such as overestimation of the coercive field , linear dependence with respect of the energy with respect to grain volume and quantum effects ( see for instance the review by awschalom and divincenzo @xcite ) .",
