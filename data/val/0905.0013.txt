    "as a result of the uncertainty principle , vacuum fluctuations occur consisting of a particle and its antiparticle created by the vacuum and annihilated in a short lifetime @xmath2 . a fluctuation consisting of a quark and its antiquark interacting via a gluon can occur in perturbation theory in qcd ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the quantum field theory that successfully describes quark interactions with great accuracy .    for educational purposes ,",
    "the author developed a classical model for the dynamics of such a quark - antiquark pair  a model that was intended to contrast the quantum mechanical prediction of the pair lifetime with the classical prediction .",
    "a surprising result was found : the pair lifetime in the classical model agrees to a good approximation with the lifetime in quantum mechanics .",
    "the model is described completely in this paper .",
    "the model becomes semiclassical in the usual sense in a natural way . because the pair lifetime from the model agrees so precisely with the quantum mechanical lifetime , particularly in the case of bottom quarks ,",

    "qcd is a physical asymptotically free field theory for any appropriate value of the input parameter @xmath3 , which is set via experimental measurement . within the qcd theory alone",
    "it would be impossible to establish @xmath0 without recourse to a measurement .",
    "but the uncertainty principle and semiclassical qcd are not one and the same , and because we find in this work that the uncertainty principle and semiclassical qcd come to agreement on the vacuum fluctuation lifetime , we can logically derive what the physical measurement must be .",
    "it is shown below that this enables us to ground @xmath0 on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "if a quark and its antiquark are positioned at rest in their center of mass reference frame and are released , then in general their mutual attraction will draw them to a collision at the origin where they will annihilate .",

    "however , the quark and antiquark experience a potential energy @xmath5 @xcite as a function of their separation distance that could reduce the mass - energy of the system , if the separation @xmath6 between particles is small enough .",

    "( [ eq : teur ] ) remarkably well , provided that the qcd interaction between the particles is well - described by the potential energy function .",
    "the second purpose of the paper follows from the fact that qcd can not specify the value of @xmath0 at arbitrary energy or 4-momentum scale @xmath15 without an established measurement of @xmath0 at some particular energy @xmath16 @xcite ; but once the renormalized coupling @xmath17 is measured , then qcd precisely gives the variation of @xmath0 as a function of energy ( the  running \" coupling ) .",
