    "a recent series of papers ( font & daigne , 2002a , b ; daigne & font , 2004 ) has shown , through general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations , that the relativistic geometrically thick discs of high - density matter expected to form after the coalescence of a binary system of neutron stars or after the gravitational collapse of a rotating supermassive star may be subject to the runaway instability which could destroy the disc on a dynamical timescale ( abramowicz , calvani and nobili , 1983 ) .",
    "accretion tori of much smaller rest - mass densities have also been observed in three - dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations investigating the properties of accretion flows onto kerr black holes ( de villiers et al .",
    "2003 ) .    with the aim of assessing whether the onset of the runaway instability depends sensitively on the choice of initial conditions , zanotti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) carried out general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of _ perturbed _ tori orbiting around a schwarzschild black hole and shown that the instability may take place independently of the way the mass accretion is induced .",
    "in addition , the simulations have indicated how the introduction of perturbations triggers harmonic oscillations in the tori which could produce large variations of their mass quadrupole . in the case in which the torus is made of high - density matter ( as in the case of binary neutron star merger ) , these oscillations could then lead to the emission of gravitational waves with amplitudes comparable with those produced in a gravitational stellar - core collapse , thus making these objects promising sources of gravitational radiation even if the instability does not set in .",
    "together with the general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations , oscillation modes of geometrically thick relativistic discs can also be studied through perturbative analyses .",
    "clearly , this second approach is computationally less intensive and allows therefore for a more detailed investigation of the parameter space . using a linear perturbative approach , rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2003b ; paper i hereafter ) , have recently investigated the axisymmetric oscillation properties of relativistic tori in a schwarzschild spacetime . to simplify the treatment and make it as analytical as possible ,",
    "the tori were built with vertically integrated and vertically averaged quantities , thus transforming the eigenvalue problem into a set of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "the tori were then modeled with a number of different non - keplerian distributions of specific angular momentum .",
    "overall , the perturbative analysis of paper i confirmed the results obtained by zanotti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) through nonlinear simulations , revealing that the oscillations found in the simulations correspond to @xmath0 modes and that the lowest - order eigenfrequencies must be in a sequence of small integers 2:3:4 ... , rather independently of the size and the specific angular momentum distribution of the tori .",
    "furthermore , a detailed study of the eigenfunctions in paper i has also provided a possible explanation for the numerical evidence that the runaway instability can be efficiently suppressed for tori with distributions of specific angular momentum that follow a power - law ( font & daigne , 2002b ) .",
    "this paper intends to extend the work of paper i and is therefore devoted to both a local and a global perturbative analysis of axisymmetric modes of oscillation of relativistic tori in the background spacetime of a kerr black hole . while the local analysis provides us with the dispersion relation for inertial - acoustic waves in relativistic non - keplerian discs , the global approach provides us with the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the @xmath0-mode oscillations of the system . as in paper",
    "i , we have here removed one spatial dimension from the problem by considering vertically integrated tori and have neglected the variations in the background spacetime produced by the perturbations ( _ i.e. _ cowling approximation ) . also in this case ,",
    "therefore , the solution of the eigenvalue problem is simplified considerably and reduces to the solution of a single second - order ordinary differential equation .",
    "overall , the results found indicate that the @xmath0-mode oscillations of vertically integrated tori in a kerr spacetime share many of the features already encountered in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "in particular : the dependence of the fundamental eigenfrequencies on the position of the rest - mass density maximum and on the radial size of the discs , the relation of @xmath0 modes with the radial epicyclic oscillations of point - like particles , or the simple 2:3 harmonic sequence for the lowest - order eigenfrequencies . furthermore , this work extends to geometrically thick discs all of the relativistic disco - seismology analyses carried so far for thin discs ( okazaki et al .",
    ", 1987 ; perez et al . , 1997 ; silbergleit et al . , 2001",
    "; kato , 2001 , rodriguez et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the oscillations of geometrically thick discs are important not only because they could produce intense gravitational radiation , but also because , in low - density discs , they may serve to explain the high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) observed in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) containing a black hole candidate . in these systems , in fact , the x - ray luminosity is modulated quasi - periodically , giving rise to distinctive peaks in the power spectral density which , so fare , have been found in sequences of small integers 2:3 ( see abramowicz and kluniak , 2001 for the intepretation of the results of remillard et al . , 1999 and strohmayer , 2001 ; see remillard et al . , 2002 , homan et al . , 2003 for further observational evidences ) .",
    "more recently and although with a much poorer statistics , the possible presence of a qpo structure has been suggested also in the power spectrum of the light curve of the two brightest x - ray flares from the galactic center black hole ( aschenbach et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "using the striking analogy between the results of the numerical simulations and the observations in lmxbs , rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2003a ) have proposed a simple model that exploits the properties of @xmath0-mode oscillations in thick discs and accounts for the complex phenomenology observed for hfqpos .",
    "it is interesting to note while such a configuration could be produced whenever an intervening process modifies the keplerian character of the flow near the black hole , the numerical simulations of de villiers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have now provided a more realistic clue to how these tori can be generated .",
    "similarly , the recent model proposed by giannios & spruit ( 2004 ) suggests a simple way in which these @xmath0-mode oscillations could be excited . both of these models were not available at the time the model by rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2003a ) was proposed .",
    "to further develop this idea , we have here considered whether a purely newtonian description of physics could be sufficient to account for the observations . for studying this , we have also performed a global analysis of the axisymmetric oscillations of vertically integrated non - keplerian discs in newtonian physics .",
    "our results indicate that no major _ qualitative _ differences emerge and that the most important features of @xmath0 modes in relativistic tori remain unchanged also in the corresponding newtonian models , albeit with _ quantitative _ differences .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ grt ] we introduce the basic assumptions and equations employed in the definition of our general relativistic , vertically integrated tori .",
    "these equations will then be used to study axisymmetric oscillations both locally , in section  [ grt_la ] , and globally , in section  [ grt_ga ] .",
    "we will first consider configurations with constant distributions of specific angular momentum and subsequently distributions in the cylindrical radial coordinate distributions of specific angular momentum that increase outwards as power - laws . in section  [ qpo ]",
    "we comment on how these axisymmetric oscillations can be used to explain the hfqpos in lmxbs containing a black hole and discuss the solution of the eigenvalue problem for vertically integrated newtonian tori .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "hereafter , greek indices are taken to run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 ; unless stated differently , we will use units in which @xmath1 .",
    "we will here assume that the torus does not contribute to the spacetime metric , which we will take to be that external to a kerr black hole .",
    "furthermore , since we are interested in the portion of the spacetime in the vicinity of the equatorial plane ( _ i.e. _ for values of the spherical angular coordinate @xmath2 ) , we will write the kerr metric in cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 and retain the zeroth - order terms in the ratio @xmath4 . in this case , the line element assumes the form ( novikov and thorne 1973 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the gravitational mass of the black hole and @xmath10 is the kerr parameter , so that the black hole angular momentum can be expressed as @xmath11 .",

    "it is also useful to introduce an orthonormal tetrad carried by the local stationary observer and defined by the one - forms with components @xmath19 in this frame , the components of the four velocity of the fluid are denoted by @xmath20 and the 3-velocity components are defined as @xmath21    we consider the perfect fluid to follow a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the polytropic constant and the adiabatic index , respectively .",
    "next , being interested in a vertically - integrated description of the torus , we introduce a _ vertically integrated _ pressure @xmath25 and a vertically integrated rest - mass density @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the local `` thickness '' of the torus .",
    "we further assume that @xmath28 and @xmath29 obey an `` effective '' polytropic eos @xmath30 so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 play the role of the polytropic constant and of the adiabatic index , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , it is important to underline that ( [ effctv_eos ] ) does not represent a vertically integrated polytropic eos since the polytropic exponent @xmath33 is now a function of the position inside the torus .",
    "after the vertical integration , we enforce the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and axisymmetry ( _ i.e. _ assume ) and simplify the equation of energy - momentum conservation to a bernoulli - type form ( kozlowski et al . , 1978 )",

    "[ a_fixed ] and , in addition , for any given radial size of the torus , the frequency of the fundamental mode will be larger for larger black hole spin .",
    "indeed , this is what is expected , since the radial epicyclic frequency for a point - like particle @xmath119 increases monotonically with @xmath120 for any value of @xmath49 ( _ cf . _",
    "[ epic ] ) .",
    "the same behaviour is observed also when @xmath121 , which allows for larger rotations rates of the black hole and is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ wmax_fixed ] .      an interesting and potentially important feature of axisymmetric @xmath0-mode oscillations of tori with constant specific angular momentum is that the lowest - order eigenfrequencies appear in a sequence 2:3:4 ... , with a good accuracy ( _ i.e. _ within 10% ) and rather independently of the details of the disc properties .",
    "this feature was first discovered through the fully nonlinear numerical simulations of zanotti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and subsequently confirmed through a perturbative analysis in a schwarzschild spacetime in paper i , and through additional independent numerical simulations ( kluniak et al .",
    ", 2004 ; lee et al . ,",
    "2004 ) .",
    "a harmonic relation for the lowest - order eigenfrequencies continues to exist also for tori with constant specific angular momentum in a kerr spacetime and rather insensitively of the black hole spin .",
    "[ o1_lconst ] shows the ratio between the frequencies of the first overtone @xmath122 and the fundamental mode @xmath123 for some representative tori with constant specific angular momentum distributions considered in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "different line types correspond to sequences that have been constructed with different locations of the rest - mass density maximum .",
    "all of the sequences span values of @xmath10 from 0 to 0.8 without showing major qualitative differences .",
    "since it is not the result of a mathematical constraint but , rather , the consequence of a global mode of oscillation , the 2:3 ratio between the fundamental mode and its first overtone is satisfied with an accuracy that is in general within 10% , but is , nevertheless , not exact .",
    "a number of different elements can contribute to a deviation from an exact relation among integers and the results of our calculations show that conditions such as the size of the disc , the location of the rest - mass density maximum , the black hole spin , the distribution of specific angular momentum , or the eos considered , can all influence this departure .",
    "note also that in fig .  [ o1_lconst ] some of the models ( _ e.g. _ c4b and c3a ) appear to have a rather large variation in the ratio @xmath124 .",
    "it should be recalled , however , that these tori exist only over a very small range in the radial extent @xmath112 ( either because of the high value of the specific angular momentum or because of the large spin of the black hole ) .",
    "being trapped in such small tori rather close to the black hole horizon where the angular velocity is larger , the @xmath0-mode oscillations will be particularly sensitive on variations of the radial size .",
    "another interesting feature of the lowest - order eigenfrequencies is that , for any given black hole rotation speed , their ratio tends to a single value @xmath125 as the size of the tori tends to zero ( _ cf .",
    "[ o1_lconst ] ) .",
    "this is in good qualitative agreement with what was found in the perturbative analysis of slender tori ( blaes 1985 ) , where the dispersion relation for generic perturbations of newtonian slender tori having constant distributions of specific angular momentum , was derived ( _ cf .",
    "1.8 of blaes 1985 , with @xmath126 , and @xmath127 ) .",
    ", with the solid lines referring to @xmath128 and the dashed ones to @xmath129.,width=321 ]      we next investigate axisymmetric @xmath0-modes in tori with non - constant distributions of specific angular momentum .",
    "clearly , in this case the problem is highly degenerate since there is a complete arbitrariness on what is the most appropriate distribution of angular momentum .",
    "the first guide in the infinite possible choices is that they should correspond to stable fluid configurations . while in newtonian theory",
    "one can make use of the simple rayleigh stability criterion for rotating inviscid fluids @xmath130 ( tassoul 1978 ) , the situation in a general relativistic framework is more complex . in particular , the condition of stability requires that , for the perfect fluids considered here , the gradient of the specific angular momentum must never point toward the interior of the quasi - circular level surfaces of @xmath97 ( seguin 1975 , abramowicz and prasanna 1985 ) . because of this",
    ", we have used a simple prescription for the specific angular momentum in which it increases outwards with a power - law distribution of the type @xmath131 where both @xmath132 and @xmath133 are positive constants ( _ cf . _ table  [ tab1 ] for the different values used ) .    following the procedure presented in the previous section , we have constructed tori by selecting the angular momentum distribution such that the position of the cusp is always located between the marginally bound and the marginally stable orbits .",
    "note that , in principle , this is not the only possible choice .",
    "non - constant distributions of specific angular momentum , in fact , allow for the construction of tori having the cusp at radii larger than the position of the marginally stable orbit .",
    "in such tori , matter lost through the cusp as a result of small perturbations would be able to find new stable circular orbits and , as a result , the accretion onto the black hole will require mechanisms other than simple perturbations in the flow . here , we have not investigated the properties of these discs whose dynamics , however , has been considered in detail by zanotti et al . , ( 2004 ) .",
    "overall , the solutions for tori with non - constant distributions of specific angular momentum share qualitative similarities with those found when @xmath134 in particular , the main properties of the @xmath0-mode oscillations in this case can be summarized as follows : firstly , the eigenfrequencies depend on the location of the rest - mass density maximum @xmath72 and on whether the latter is located on the increasing or decreasing branch of the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "secondly , all eigenfrequencies tend to the radial epicyclic frequency at the location of @xmath72 in the limit of small tori .",
    "thirdly , as the result of the presence of an _ evanescent - wave _ region ( see paper i for a detailed discussion ) , the eigenfunctions become vanishingly small at the inner edge of the disc , while they do not do so at the outer edge . finally , for any sequence built with fixed @xmath86 , the eigenfrequencies increase as the spin of the black hole is increased .    , but all refer to the same value for @xmath132 ( _ cf . _",
    "table  [ tab1]).,width=321 ]    despite these similarities , a difference does emerge when investigating non - constant angular momentum tori . in this case , in fact , the ratio between the first overtone and the fundamental frequency of oscillation @xmath124 has a behaviour which is more complex than the one found when @xmath134 in particular , it depends not only to the position of @xmath72 , but also on the values of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , as well as on @xmath10 .",
    "most importantly , while the eigenfrequencies remain in a harmonic sequence for sufficiently large discs , departures from a 2:3 ratio can be observed for very small discs .",
    "this is shown in fig.[o1_lpower2 ] , where the @xmath135 ratio is plotted for sequences of models orbiting around central black holes rotating at different rates and having different distributions of specific angular momentum ( see table  [ tab1 ] for the model descriptions ) .",
    "in all the cases considered , however , the departure from a 2:3 ratio is less than 20% .    finally ,",
    "note that , as the size of the discs tends to zero , the ratios do not tend to the same value , as was the case for constant specific angular momentum tori but , rather , to a value that depends on the index @xmath133 of the power - law .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ o1_lpower ] , where we illustrate results for sequences of tori with the same @xmath136 but different indices @xmath133 , built around the same kerr black hole with @xmath110 .",
    "also in this case , a closer agreement with a harmonic relation between the lowest - order eigenfrequencies is recovered for sufficiently large discs .    .",
    "the tori are modelled with a power - law distribution of specific angular momentum and the different lines refer to different choices of the index @xmath133 , but all assume the same value of @xmath137.,width=321 ]",
    "observations of x - ray emissions from binary systems comprising a stellar - mass compact object have long been considered important tools to test general relativity in strong - field regimes . in particular , the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) observed in lmxbs binaries containing a black hole candidate have been proposed as a tool for measuring black hole properties such as mass and spin in a direct way . in such systems , the x - ray observations show a particularly rich phenomenology in which the luminosity is modulated quasi - periodically , giving rise to distinctive peaks in the power spectral density .",
    "a puzzling feature of the qpo frequencies in these systems is that they are found in sequences of small integers ( _ i.e. _ 1:2 , 2:3 , or 1:2:3 ; abramowicz and kluniak , 2001 ; remillard et al . , 2002 ;",
    "homan et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "numerous models have been suggested to explain the hfqpos and their peculiar harmonic property ( see abramowicz and kluniak , 2004 for a recent review ) but the scarcity of the observational data , on the one hand , and the crudeness of the different models , on the other hand , have not yet made it possible to determine which model provides the most likely description of the processes responsible for the qpos .",
    "it should be noted the first steps towards a more quantitative and physically realistic description of the emission properties of possible qpo models have recently been taken ( schittman and bertschinger , 2004 ; schnittman , 2004 ) .    among the proposed models ,",
    "one is particularly simple as it is based on the assumption that the accretion disc around the black hole terminates with a sub - keplerian part , _",
    "i.e _ a torus of small size ( rezzolla et al . , 2003a ) .",
    "this model was motivated by the numerical simulations of relativistic tori in a schwarzschild spacetime ( zanotti et al . , 2003 )",
    "and by the subsequent perturbative study of @xmath0-mode oscillations of relativistic vertically integrated tori presented in paper i. a cornerstone of this model is the evidence , both numerical and analytic , that in these objects the fundamental mode and the first overtones are found to be in the harmonic sequence 2:3:4 ... to a good precision and in a very wide parameter space .    because the @xmath0 modes considered in the above model represent the basic oscillation modes of a non - keplerian disc , some of their features are not expected to be very sensitive to the properties of the spacetime which determine the motion of the fluid .",
    "the harmonic 2:3 relation between the fundamental frequency and the first overtone is one such feature and , indeed , this property has been encountered essentially unmodified in schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes , but also in a newtonian gravitational potential . because of this , it is then natural to consider whether a fully newtonian description of the physics is sufficient to account for the phenomenology observed in hfqpos , or whether general relativity is indeed necessary .",
    "this question in addressed in the following section .      in order to assess whether @xmath0-mode oscillations in purely newtonian tori could account for the hfqpo phenomenology ,",
    "we have performed a global analysis of the axisymmetric oscillations of vertically integrated non - keplerian discs in newtonian physics and compared the results with those obtained in a general relativistic framework .",
    "consider therefore a non - selfgravitating perfect fluid torus in equilibrium and orbiting a central object of mass @xmath138 producing a gravitational potential @xmath139 .",
    "as in the general relativistic case , the system of equations describing the torus will be simplified by considering vertically integrated or vertically averaged quantities , which we indicate as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in analogy with the corresponding relativistic quantities ( _ cf .",
    "[ p ] and [ sigma ] ) . in order to handle simpler expressions",
    "we normalize all quantities as @xmath140 where @xmath141 , while @xmath142 is the maximum mass density and where we have defined @xmath143 the equilibrium configurations are then obtained by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation which , in terms of the normalized quantities , is written simply as @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 , with @xmath147 being the angular velocity at @xmath148 .",
    "introducing now the emden function @xmath149 and its related quantity @xmath150 , the normalized rest - mass density @xmath151 can written as @xmath152 , and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is expressed as an ordinary differential equation for @xmath153 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath154 once the angular velocity distribution @xmath155 is fixed and a choice is made for the inner radius @xmath156 , equation ( [ hydro_eq ] ) can be integrated to provide the background newtonian torus in equilibrium .    for simplicity",
    "we now restrict our attention to constant specific angular momentum distributions so that the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ hydro_eq ] ) simplifies to @xmath157 before discussing the solution of the eigenvalue problem , it is useful to recall the features of the newtonian models that represent important differences from the relativistic counterparts .",
    "the first one is that the right - hand side of equation ( [ hydro_eq_lconst ] ) is just the derivative of an effective potential ( _ i.e. _ the one in the round brackets ) and it is therefore straightforward to calculate the inner edge of the largest possible torus as the radial position at which this potential vanishes , _ i.e. _ @xmath158 .",
    "the second feature to notice is again easily derived from equation ( [ hydro_eq_lconst ] ) and shows that the position of the mass density maximum ( _ i.e. _ @xmath159 ) is simply given by @xmath160 , coinciding with the position at which the specific angular momentum assumes a keplerian value .",
    "as in relativistic tori , @xmath161 grows with increasing specific angular momentum ; unlike relativistic tori , however , no lower or upper limits exist for @xmath161 . indeed , for vanishingly small values of @xmath97 , it is possible to construct tori whose pressure maxima lie arbitrarily close to the rotation axis .",
    "this property is the consequence of the fact that , in newtonian physics and for constant distributions of specific angular momentum , @xmath97 is not constrained to lie in a finite interval .",
    "this represents a major difference with respect to the general relativistic picture and , as will be discussed later on , makes the parameter space for the background models effectively unbounded .",
    "we next proceed to consider the eigenvalue problem and , as we did for the general relativistic case , we neglect perturbations in the gravitational potential ( cowling approximation ) and introduce perturbations in the velocity and pressure with a harmonic time dependence of the type @xmath162 . to simplify the notation ,",
    "hereafter we will omit the `` tilde '' on all variables , which however should be meant to refer to normalized quantities .",
    "as a result , the perturbed euler and continuity equations can be written as @xmath163 where , in analogy with the corresponding relativistic quantities , @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the vertically averaged radial and azimuthal velocities , respectively ( _ cf . _ eqs .",

    "we show with solid circles the values of the newtonian keplerian radial epicyclic frequency at the different locations of @xmath72 , while the inset shows the ratio of the first overtone and of fundamental eigenfrequency as a function of the radial extents @xmath112.,width=321 ]    after some simple algebra , equations ( [ nwtpert1])([nwtpert3 ] ) are cast into a single , second - order ordinary differential equation @xmath166\\delta { q } ' +       \\frac{nd}{{q}}\\delta { q } =      0\\ , \\ ] ] for the quantity @xmath167 defined as @xmath168 in equation ( [ q  ] ) , the quantity @xmath169 measures the deviation of the eigenfrequency @xmath75 from the newtonian radial epicyclic frequency @xmath170 , which coincides with the orbital frequency when the orbital motion is keplerian , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath171 . note that while equation ( [ q  ] ) appears to be singular at the radial position where @xmath172 , it is actually regular everywhere since @xmath173 and @xmath174 vanish at the same position ( _ cf .",

    "the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the axisymmetric @xmath0 modes described by equations ( [ nwtpert1])([nwtpert3 ] ) have been computed using the same numerical method discussed in the previous sections and some representative results are presented in fig .",
    "more specifically , we show the eigenfrequencies of the fundamental mode of oscillation for three sequences of constant angular momentum newtonian tori orbiting a central source of gravitational potential with a mass of @xmath175 .",
    "the sequences have been built keeping the position of the density maximum fixed ( _ i.e. _ @xmath176 , 7.0 and 9.0 , respectively ) and varying the position of the inner radius to produce tori of different radial sizes .",
    "the inset , on the other hand , shows the ratio of the first overtone to the fundamental eigenfrequency as a function of the radial size of the torus for the three different sequences . a first glance at fig .  [ newt ] and a comparison with figs .",
    "[ a_fixed ] , [ wmax_fixed ] and [ o1_lconst ] , shows that no major _ qualitative _ differences emerge in a newtonian framework and that all of the most important features of @xmath0 modes in relativistic tori remain unchanged also in the corresponding newtonian models .",
    "most notably , the fundamental eigenfrequencies depend on the position of the mass density and on the radial sizes of the discs , increasing as the latter decrease . in addition , as the radial sizes tend to zero , the fundamental eigenfrequencies tend to the values of the radial epicyclic frequencies at the position of the mass density maxima .",
    "finally , along all sequences , the first and second eigenfrequencies are in a harmonic sequence 2:3 of small integers .",
    "besides this qualitative agreement , however , _ quantitative _ differences are also present and can be easily appreciated by comparing , for instance , the curve for @xmath177 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ wmax_fixed ] with the dotted line in fig .",
    "indeed , the simultaneous presence of qualitative similarities and quantitative differences between newtonian and general relativistic models is not surprising and reflects the fact that the @xmath0 modes are fundamental modes of oscillation of orbiting fluid objects . as such",
    ", they depend only in part on the gravitational field ( or background spacetime ) in which the fluid is moving .",
    "indeed , also for rotating stars , the qualitative features of the @xmath0-mode oscillations are preserved when going from a newtonian description to a full general relativistic one , with quantitative differences being present , however , and depending on the strength of the spacetime curvature .",
    "finally , note that because the radial epicyclic frequencies represent the asymptotic limit of the fundamental eigenfrequencies for vanishing torus sizes and since the newtonian epicyclic frequency is always _ larger _ than the corresponding general relativistic one for all values of the black hole spin ( _ cf .",
    "_ solid and dotted lines in fig .  [ epic ] ) , all of the newtonian frequencies along a sequence with @xmath134 will be larger than the corresponding relativistic ones .",
    "this , together with the fact that the newtonian epicyclic frequency diverges for vanishingly small radii [ _ i.e. _ @xmath178 , makes it clear that for any observed qpo frequency it will be possible to find a newtonian torus of size @xmath112 that could produce @xmath0 mode oscillations with the correct frequencies and in a 2:3 ratio . stated differently , while the parameter space in the @xmath179 plane for relativistic tori is bounded above by the sequence approaching the largest epicyclic frequency admissible by a kerr black hole with spin @xmath180 , this restriction does not exist for newtonian tori and a newtonian physicist , who ignores the existence of marginally stable orbits or of an event horizon , would be able to find an equilibrium solution at every point in that plane .",
    "as a result , and at least in principle , newtonian physics could explain the hfqpos if the only information available is the mass of the central object @xmath9 and the frequencies of the modulation in the x - ray luminosity @xmath75 .",
    "the only way to remove this ambiguity and thus disprove the interpretation of the newtonian physicist , would be to make combined measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath75 , together with the radial extension of the torus @xmath112 , or of the position of the mass density maximum @xmath72 .",
    "while both these observations wwould probably be difficult to make in practice , similar difficulties are found also in proving the existence of stellar - mass black holes in x - ray binaries ( abramowicz , kluniak and lasota , 2002 ) .",
    "this is simply the consequence of the fact that no limit exists in newtonian physics to the compactness of the sources of gravitational potential .",
    "we have presented the study of the oscillation properties of non - selfgravitating tori orbiting around kerr black holes .",
    "this work extends the previous investigations of the oscillation properties of relativistic tori in a schwarzschild background and their importance in explaining the hfqpos in x - ray binaries containing a black hole candidate ( rezzolla et al . , 2003a ) .",
    "following the same approach presented in these previous works , we have here considered the axisymmetric @xmath181mode oscillations of relativistic tori assuming a vertically integrated description to reduce the eigenvalue problem to the solution of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "we have first considered a local analysis in a kerr spacetime and determined the relations between acoustic and inertial waves , showing that both are present in the oscillations of geometrically thick discs and that they play a different role depending on the radial size of the disc and on the position of the rest - mass density maximum .",
    "we have then computed the eigenfunctions and the eigenfrequencies of the axisymmetric @xmath0 modes for a large variety of background models which differed either in the spin of the black hole or in the distributions of specific angular momentum considered .",
    "the latter , in particular , have been considered to be constant or to increase outwards following a power - law in radius .    on the whole ,",
    "the @xmath0-mode oscillations of vertically integrated tori in a kerr spacetime possess all of the most important features already encountered in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "firstly , the fundamental eigenfrequencies depend on the position of the rest - mass density maximum and on the radial size of the discs , increasing as the latter decreases .",
    "secondly , the fundamental eigenfrequencies tend to the values of the radial epicyclic frequencies at the position of the mass density maxima as the radial sizes of the tori tend to zero . finally , for tori constructed with constant distributions of specific angular momentum , the first and second eigenfrequencies are in a harmonic sequence 2:3 of small integers .",
    "this ratio is not exact but is very accurately satisfied with deviations of @xmath182 at most . for non - constant distributions of angular momentum , on the other hand , the harmonic sequence is still present for sufficiently large tori , but the deviation from a precise 2:3 ratio increases , being @xmath183 at most .",
    "we have also investigated the implications that @xmath0-mode oscillations could have on the hfqpos observed in x - ray binaries containing a black hole candidate . in a model recently proposed , the presence of a sub - keplerian flow ( _ i.e. _ a torus ) near the black hole and its oscillations are used to explain many of the features of the hfqpos and , in particular , the 2:3 ratio in the peaks of the power spectral density ( rezzolla et al . , 2003a ) .",
    "in this model , the measure of the oscillation frequencies and the knowledge of the @xmath0-mode properties can be used to measure directly the black hole properties , such as the mass and spin , once a reasonable estimate of the torus size is made .    in view of this , we have considered whether an equivalent interpretation of the hfqpos phenomenology can also be made in terms of a purely newtonian description of physics . to this scope , we have performed a global analysis of vertically integrated newtonian tori following the same mathematical and numerical approach developed for tori in a kerr spacetime .",
    "our results indicate that , at least _",
    "qualitatively _ , the @xmath0-mode oscillations of newtonian tori preserve all of the properties encountered in their relativistic counterparts . furthermore , while _ quantitative _ differences do exist between the two frameworks , it may be difficult to distinguish between the two unless the oscillation frequencies are measured together with the radial extension of the torus @xmath112 , or through the measurement of the position of the mass density maximum @xmath72 .",
