    "the main parameter governing stellar evolution is mass ; however , mass is hard to measure , as only a small portion of stars are members of eclipsing binaries for which mass may be measured directly .",

    "the light curves of rr lyr stars were @xmath7 clipped in order to remove obvious outliers ( most probably caused by the nonphotometric conditions for some epochs ) . the periodograms were calculated using a discrete fourier transform .",
    "because of the strong daily aliases , up to the four highest peaks for each star were considered for further analysis if their amplitudes were larger than @xmath8 of the highest peak .",
    "the photometry was phased with each trial period ; up to the fourth - order fourier polynomial was subtracted from rrc star light curves , and up to the eighth - order for rrab stars .",
    "then , the periodograms were calculated for the prewhitened light curves , and once more up to the four highest peaks were considered .",
    "the additional constrain was that the selected period could not be a daily alias of the previously found period . for each star ,",
