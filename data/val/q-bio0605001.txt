    "the globalization of human interactions have created a fertile ground for the fast and broad spread of infectious diseases , potentially leading to worldwide epidemics .",
    "we are thus force to understand the spreading of infectious diseases within this global scenario . yet , the study of worldwide epidemics is challenging given the heterogeneity of the populations involved @xcite .",
    "the first sign of heterogeneity is given by the variability of the reproductive number within or across populations @xcite .",
    "the reproductive number is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a primary infected case within a population of susceptible individuals . in the case of sexually transmitted diseases",
    "the reproductive number is proportional to the rate of sexual partner acquisition @xcite and it exhibits wide fluctuations @xcite . in network based approaches",
    "the reproductive number is proportional to the node s degree @xcite and it exhibits wide fluctuations as well @xcite . in the absence of biases among the connections between agents this heterogeneity is completely taken into account by the reproductive number distribution @xcite .",
    "there are other properties beyond the reproductive number requiring the subdivision of a population in different classes or types .",
    "this includes but is not limited to age , geographical location , social status and sexual behavior . in general",
    "these heterogeneities can not be characterized by a single probability distribution .",
    "they require a multi - type approach with probability distributions characterizing each type and a mixing matrix describing the patterns of transmission among them .",
    "multi - type models are difficult to deal with and are generally tackled using multi - agent simulations @xcite .",
    "the advantage of multi - agent simulations is that we can consider several details and study their impact on the spreading dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "given the large number of variables and model parameters it is difficult to understand which are the key variables driving the system s dynamics .",
    "therefore , analytical calculations are required to funnel the multi - agent simulations into specific regions of the parameters space .    in this work",
    "i study the spreading of infectious diseases on multi - type networks .",
    "i take as starting point the static problem formulation developed by newman @xcite and the theory of age - dependent multi - type branching process @xcite .",
    "i develop these mathematical approaches to accommodate some distinctive properties of real networks that have not previously considered . in section [ sec : multi ] i introduce the basic framework . focusing on the population structure",
    "i consider the contact - graph characterizing the detailed interactions among agents and , at a metapopulation level , the type - network characterizing the interactions among agent s types . through some simple examples",
    "i illustrate the properties of the mixing matrix and its type - network representation .",
    "this section ends defining a branching process modeling a spanning tree from an index agent to all other agents in the contact - graph . in section [ sec : spreading ] i characterize the local spreading dynamics from an agent to its contacts , taking the susceptible , infected , and removed ( sir ) model as a case study . bringing together the underlying network structure and the local transmission dynamics in section [ sec : spreading ] i define a branching process that models the disease spreading dynamics . in section [ sec : iterative ] i extend the iterative approach for a single type @xcite to accommodate the particularities of the multi - type case .",
    "focusing on the expected behavior , in section [ sec : average ] i obtain general equations determining the progression of the expected number of cumulative and new infections .",
    "starting from these equations i analyze some limited cases .",
    "first , i derive the final expected outbreak size and , second , i analyze the time progression of the expected outbreak size for the case of a time homogeneous local transmission . in section [ sec : intervention ] i discuss the impact of the population heterogeneity on intervention strategies .",
    "i emphasize the role of the characteristic distance between agents to quantify the impact of intervention strategies on small - world populations .",
    "i also illustrate interventions targeting specific agent s types using a bipartite population as a case study .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] i provide an overview of the main results and discuss future directions .",
    "consider a population of @xmath0 agents that are susceptible to an infectious disease . by _",
    "i mean any entity that could host and transmit the disease .",
    "since we are interested on the transmission of infectious diseases among humans an agent is a human in the first place . for vector - borne diseases we could have in addition agents representing the intermediary host while for airborne diseases",
    "an agent could also represent a public place .",
    "the agents are assumed to be heterogeneous meaning that there are different agent classes or _",
    "types _ according to their pattern of connectivity to other agents and/or to the speed at which they could potentially transmit an infectious disease .",
    "for instance , human can be divided according to their age , social status and geographical location .",
    "furthermore , in the case of vector- and air - born diseases there is an additional type given by the non - human intermediary .",
    "more precisely , let us assume that the agent population is divided in @xmath1 types and there are @xmath2 agents of type @xmath3 , satisfying the normalization condition    @xmath4    note that within this work i use the indexes @xmath5 for the agent s type . in the following",
    "i introduce two representations of the population structure at the agent and type levels , respectively .",
    "the contact - graph takes precisely into account who could potentially transmit the disease to whom @xcite .",
    "more precisely ,    the contact - graph is a labeled graph where vertices represent agents , edges represent the potential disease transmission channels among them , and the vertices are labeled according to the agent s type .",
    "[ cg ]    the contact - graph represents the population mixing at the agent s level . since there is a one - to - one relation between vertices and the corresponding agents i use these two terms interchangeable .",
    "all the information necessary to characterize a given graph is provided by its adjacency matrix .",
    "yet , we should take into account the large size of real populations and their change in time .",
    "in general , the only way to achieve such a detailed description relies on agent - based simulations .",
    "my scope is to bypass this detailed description and focus on statistical properties that does not depend on the population structure details or their change in time . yet , to achieve that i need to specify the time scale where these statistical properties are measured .",
    "excluding the effect of patient isolation or any other intervention , the time scale that matters is the time interval from the infection of an agent to its death or recovery , i.e. the disease life time within an agent .",
    "at this point i intentionally exclude the effect of interventions , such as patient isolation , in order to achieve a more general approach .",
    "their influence is taken into account when defining the disease spreading dynamics ( see section [ sec : spreading ] ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the disease life time is a random variable .",
    "therefore , the statistical properties introduced below are the expectation after averaging over the disease life time distribution .",
    "the degree of a node is the total number of edges emanating from it regardless the type of the node at the other end .",
    "let @xmath6 be probability distribution that a type @xmath7 node has degree @xmath8 and denote by    @xmath9    its mean .",
    "note that by allowing @xmath8 to take values larger than one we are already taking into account the existence of concurrency @xcite .    to characterize the spreading process it is also relevant to determine the same distribution but for a vertex found and the end of an edge selected at random .",
    "this sampling introduces a bias towards nodes with higher degree resulting in the probability distribution    @xmath10    with average excess degree    @xmath11    where the minus one subtracts the edge from where the node was reached .",
    "associated with these two probability distributions we introduce the generating functions    @xmath12    @xmath13    from the derivatives of @xmath14 and @xmath15 we obtain the moments of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . for instance",
    "@xmath18    @xmath19    since the agent population is finite there is a typical distance @xmath20 between every two agents on the contact - graph . social experiments such as the kevin bacon and erds numbers @xcite or the milgram experiment @xcite reveal that social actors are separated by a small number of acquaintances ( `` small - world '' property @xcite ) .",
    "this observation is supported by theoretical approaches demonstrating that @xmath20 grows at most as @xmath21 in random graphs @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that for several real networks @xmath20 actually decreases or remains constant as the network evolve and increases its size @xcite .",
    "thus , i explicitly take into account that @xmath20 is finite .",
    "let us assume that type @xmath7 agents establish connections with other agents at a constant rate @xmath22 and that the disease life time is constant and equal to @xmath23 .",
    "in this case we obtain a poisson distribution for the agent s degree    @xmath24    furthermore , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "[ poisson1 ]          at the metapopulation level the population structure of the is determined by the mixing patterns among the different agent s types . given a type @xmath7 agent and one of its edges let @xmath28 be the probability that the agent at the other end is of type @xmath29 ( _ mixing matrix _ ) . from the mixing matrix we can construct the type - network characterizing the metapopulation structure .    _",
    "type - network : _ in the type - network a node represents a type , an arc is drawn from type @xmath7 to @xmath29 if @xmath30 , and the arc s weights are given by @xmath28 .",

    "[ typegraph ] shows some simple type - networks .",

    "[ typegraph]a ) .",
    "a bipartite population is represented by two nodes with an incoming and an outgoing arc ( fig .",
    "[ typegraph]b ) .",
    "this example could model a heterosexual population with no other distinction than gender or a metapopulation given by people and public places @xcite .",

    "let us consider an epidemic outbreak starting from a single agent ( index case ) . in the worth case scenario",
    "the disease propagates to all the agents that could be reached from the index case using the network connections .",
    "thus , the outbreak is represented by a spanning or causal tree from the index case to all reachable agents . on this tree",
    ", the generation of an agent corresponds with the topological or hopping distance from the index case .",
    "this picture motivates the introduction of the following branching process :    multi - type annealed spanning tree ( ast )    consider a labeled contact - graph characterized by @xmath32 and the type - network @xmath33 .",
    "the multi - type annealed spanning tree ( ast ) is the branching process satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "the process start from an index case of type @xmath34 at generation @xmath35 .",

    "3 .   a son at generation @xmath39 does not generate new sons .",
    "[ ast ]    the term annealed means that we are not analyzing the true ( quenched ) spanning tree on the graph but a branching process with similar statistical properties .",
    "this approximation is particularly good if the contact - graph is continuously changing in time albeit the constancy of its statistical properties .",
    "a similar mathematical construction has been previously introduced by newman @xcite .",
    "the main difference here is the explicit consideration of the truncation distance @xmath20 .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that all results derived below are exact for the multi - type ast but an approximation for the original population structure .",
    "to proceed further we should specify how the disease is transmitted from an agent to its neighbors in the contact - graph .",

    "we also need to specify when it takes place . given a type @xmath7 agent ( primary case ) and one of its neighbors of type @xmath29 ( secondary case ) , we define the generation time @xmath43 as the time elapse from the infection of the primary case to the infection of the secondary case provided it happens .",

    "a _ removed _ agent is one that has been previously infected but it is already excluded from the spreading process . within this work the removal of an agent takes into account intervention strategies resulting in the isolation of infected individuals from the disease transmission chain .",

    "the gamma distribution can be also obtained from the fit to some empirical distribution of generation times ( see fig . [",

    "fig : gtau]d ) .",
    "second , in the regime @xmath216 although the fraction of infected agents is still given by a gamma distribution the exponent of the initial power law growth is given by @xmath217 , i.e.    @xmath218    therefore , the existence of intermediary steps reduces the the small - world effect by a factor given by the number of intermediary steps @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , by a factor of about four for sars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gtau]b ) .",
    "the expected outbreak size is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath125 ( [ nijsc ] ) , which plays the role of the basic reproductive number in homogeneous populations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the aim of intervention strategies is to reduce the characteristic reproductive number @xmath125 . on the other hand ,",
    "intervention strategies implies an economical cost , including but not limited to the development of new vaccines and their deployment through vaccination campaigns .",
    "our task is to design optimal intervention strategies that minimize the expected outbreak size with a feasible economical cost .    to be more precise",
    "let us consider a scenario where the disease is transmitted at constant rate @xmath185 from infected to susceptible agents , infected agents are isolated at a rate @xmath219 and a fraction @xmath220 of the population is immune to the disease . in this case",
    "the infection and removal times follows the exponential distribution functions @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively .",
    "thus , from ( [ rabsir ] ) we obtain @xmath223 where    @xmath224    is the blocking fraction , i.e. the fraction of potential disease transmissions that are blocked either because of immunization or patient isolation .",
    "since @xmath223 is independent of the primary and secondary case types we can write the reproductive number matrices ( [ aij ] ) and ( [ bij ] ) as @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively , where    @xmath227    in turn , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath98 is given by    @xmath228    where @xmath229 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath230 .    from the analysis made in section [ sec : finalsize ]",
    "it follows that there are two different scenarios depending @xmath193 . for simplicity",
    "let us focus on the complete type - network case where @xmath231 .",
    "when @xmath167 the target of intervention strategies is @xmath168 , which is the consensus in the literature @xcite . the blocking fraction to achieve this",
    "is obtained from ( [ lk ] ) , resulting in    @xmath232    this result has been already reported , at least for the case of two types @xcite . when @xmath20 is small , however , the expected outbreak size is a smooth function of @xmath125 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : noo ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath233 does not represent a threshold value in small - world populations .",
    "so far we have considered homogenous intervention strategies .",
    "now let us assume that the rate of patient isolation and the immunized fraction are now different for each agent s type and given by @xmath234 and @xmath55 , respectively . in this case",
    "the blocking fraction is given by    @xmath235    and @xmath236 , which depends on the type of both the primary and secondary case .",
    "from the perron - frobenius theorem it follows that @xmath125 is a continuous increasing function of all the entries of the corresponding matrix @xmath98 @xcite . since @xmath237 then @xmath125 is a continuous decreasing function of @xmath238 for all @xmath239 .",
    "the goal is to determine which strategy leads to the largest reduction of @xmath125 .",
    "consider the spread of hiv on an heterosexual population with no further distinction beyond gender . in this case",

    "there is significant evidence that social networks are characterized by ( _ i _ ) wide connectivity fluctuations and ( _ ii _ ) the small - world property @xcite .",
    "the variability in the number of contacts ( _ i _ ) has a direct impact on the reproductive number .",
    "this fact has been taken into account since the seminal works of may and anderson considering the variability in the rate of sexual partner acquisition@xcite .",
    "more recently it has gained attention for other infectious diseases as well , following the observation of super - spreading events in the 2002 - 2003 sars epidemics @xcite . yet , the small - world property ( _ ii _ ) has been completely neglected .",
    "from my studies of the single type case @xcite i have shown that intervention strategies are modulated by the average distance @xmath20 between agents in the corresponding contact - graph . in this work",
    "i have demonstrated that this result is also valid for heterogeneous populations . in this last case",
    "the characteristic reproductive number is given by the largest eigenvalue of the reproductive number matrix .",
    "the good news is that in spite of this modulation by @xmath20 the target of intervention strategies is still the characteristic reproductive number .",
    "that is , the expected outbreak size still decreases with decreasing the characteristic reproductive number .",
    "the bad news is that to quantify the impact of the intervention strategies we need to estimate @xmath20 .",
    "there are different paths to estimate @xmath20 .",
    "first , we can use a direct approach as the milgram s experiments @xcite .",
    "second , we can measure other network properties such as the degree distribution and then try to estimate @xmath20 using network models @xcite .",
    "finally , i have shown that the progression of the expected number of new infections is modulated by @xmath20 ( see @xcite and section [ sec : spreading ] ) .",
    "more precissely , in small world populations the incidence is expected to grow as a power law and we can estimate @xmath20 from the power law exponent .",
    "further work is required to test the validity of the coarse grained description of the type - network approach .",
    "this can be done by running agent based simulations where we can have a strict control of the different statistical properties characterizing the population structure .",
    "these statistical properties can be then plug in into the type network approach to obtain qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be compared with the simulations results .    in conclusion , this work opens new avenues to future research on the spreading of infectious diseases on heterogeneous populations .",
    "it allows for a qualitative understanding through the analysis of the type - network representation of the mixing matrix .",
    "more important , it leads to general results that can be tackled case by case using exact or approximate calculations and numerical computations ."
