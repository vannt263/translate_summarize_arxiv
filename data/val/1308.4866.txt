    "high - resolution low - temperature xrd data were collected at the id31 beamline of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf , grenoble ) at a wavelength of about 0.35 .",

    "the vienna ab initio simulation package ( ` vasp5.2`)@xcite was used in combination with lda , gga , revpbe,@xcite dft - d@xcite and hse06@xcite exchange - correlation functionals . for a full relaxation of all atomic positions in the high - pressure structures , we employed the gga+@xmath0 method implemented in ` vasp ` .",
    "strong electronic correlations were included in two different ways : first , by mapping the lda bands onto an effective one - orbital tight - binding ( tb ) model .",

    "the 1.5ev offset in the @xmath26 values arises from the different exchange - correlation functionals and different basis sets used by the two codes .",

    "the positions of hydrogen atoms are essential for deriving reliable microscopic magnetic models .",
    "though h is not directly involved in the magnetic superexchange process , in particular its bonding angle has a crucial effect on the type and strength of the exchange couplings.@xcite the standard experimental technique for determining h - positions is neutron scattering which is , however , difficult , expensive and requires big single crystals ( @xmath39mm@xmath40 ) , preferably of deuterium - enriched samples . for these reasons ,",
    "h - positions remain undetermined for most minerals .",
    "alternatively , the hydrogen positions could be obtained by structural optimization within dft . however , to establish such a procedure , first a careful analysis and comparison with experimental data is mandatory .",
    "malachite , thus , provides an excellent opportunity to test several different dft functionals and compare the results with the neutron data ( table  [ h_opt ] ) .",
    "standard lda and gga functionals should provide a reasonable description of the covalent o ",
    "however , they may have deficiencies in describing weak dispersion effects,@xcite in particular longer o@xmath41h hydrogen bonds that determine the direction of the covalent o ",
    "since there is no functional particularly designed for an accurate description of hydrogen bonds , we test different functionals that either incorporate empirical corrections for van der waals interactions ( dft - d ) or contain different adjustments providing an improved description of lattice parameters , cohesive energies , and different bond lengths ( pbesol , revpbe , hse06 ) .",
    "although footing on very different levels of sophistication , all tested functionals supply excellent results , in particular , for the relevant bond angles ( table  [ h_opt ] ) .",
    "the bond lengths are generally overestimated , with the typical deviation of @xmath42% , the largest deviation of 3% for lda , and the smallest deviation of less than 0.5% for hse06 .",
    "it thus seems that hse06 provides the best results .",
    "however , the structural data for malachite are obtained at room temperature , whereas dft results pertain to the crystal structure at 0k .",
    "the experimental bond lengths are thus longer because of thermal expansion .",
    "additionally , room temperature data are affected by the libration , a strong rocking vibration of the o ",

    "h distance .",
    "this effect is well seen in the oblate thermal ellipsoids of hydrogen atoms that are stretched in the directions transverse to the o ",

    "our results , however , show exactly the opposite , with @xmath74 being twice as large as @xmath75 .",
    "there are two reasons for this behavior .",
    "first , the sizable intradimer transfer @xmath76 is indeed not unusual and can also be found in several other cu - compounds featuring doubly bridged cu@xmath5o@xmath4 dimers .",
    "for example , in clinoclase the respective transfer amounts to 191mev ( 101.9@xmath37),@xcite in cu@xmath5as@xmath5o@xmath10 @xmath77mev ( 101.7@xmath37 )  @xcite and in li@xmath3cub@xmath3o@xmath10 @xmath76 is 235mev ( 100.4@xmath37).@xcite the values in parentheses are the average intradimer bridging angles , which are very similar to that in malachite ( 100.5@xmath37 ) .",

    "thus , second , the twisting of the chains has to be considered .",

    ". a similar effect of out - of - plane angles was discussed for clinoclase.@xcite the fact that the long - range interchain transfer @xmath79 is of similar strength as @xmath78 can , on one hand , be attributed to this reduction of @xmath78 and , on the other hand , to the polarization of the wfs by the carbonate group ( see fig .",
    "[ wf1 ] ) that might significantly increase the overlap of the wfs despite the long cu - cu distance ( 1.8 times longer than that for @xmath78 ) .",
