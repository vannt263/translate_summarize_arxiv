    "existing high - angular - resolution observations toward ngc 7538 irs 1 mostly focus on hot dust and ionized gas in the close vicinity of the young o star , while kinematics and physical conditions of molecular gas in the dusty envelope is less clear .",

    "observational results are presented in section [ result ] , followed by discussions on their implications in section [ dis ] .",
    "finally , a summary of the main findings is given in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the sma observations were undertaken on 2007 july 13 with eight antennas in the compact - north configuration .",
    "the weather was very good during the observation , with 1.5 to 2.5 mm precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) , corresponding to atmospheric optical depth at 225 ghz , @xmath14 , around 0.08 to 0.12 . to cover the entire outflow we observed two fields centered at ( r.a . ,",

    "the 2@xmath172 ghz correlator was configured to cover rest frequencies about 219.2 to 221.2 ghz in the lower sideband and about 229.2 to 231.2 ghz in the upper sideband , with a uniform spectral resolution of 812.5 khz ( @xmath181.1 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "we observed 3c273 and callisto for bandpass calibration and mwc349 , for which a flux of 1.65 jy at 225 ghz was adopted , for flux calibration .",
    "time dependent gains were monitored by interleavingly observing j0102 + 584 and bl lac every 30 mins .",
    "the primary calibrations were carried out with the idl mir package , which allows to determine antenna gains ( versus frequency or time ) by simultaneously fitting multiple calibrators .",
    "the calibrated visibilities were exported to miriad for further processing .",
    "a continuum database was constructed from line - free channels using the miriad task uvlin .",
    "we self - calibrated the continuum solving for phase corrections with decreasing time intervals ( 5 , 2 , 1 min ) , and then solving for phase and amplitude corrections for the last iteration .",
    "the solutions from the self - calibration were applied to spectral line data as well .    in figure",

    ". we also found that features associated with mm29 are identifiable in the continuum and spectral line images without self - calibration .",
    "furthermore , we obtained a model of mm1 by restricting clean ( a deconvolution task in miriad ) to a polygon closely around mm1 , subtracted `` mm1 '' from the calibrated visibilities using the task uvmodel , and imaged the residual visibilities ; mm1 was completely invisible while mm29 were clearly seen in the image , indicating that none of the fainter cores was falsely generated due to sidelobes of mm1 during deconvolution .",

    "the effective integration time toward each cell is about 10 s. the aos spectrometer has 1024 channels throughout the 50 mhz bandwidth , thus a spectral resolution of 48.8 khz ( or 0.066 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard class package . the combination of the sma and single - dish data was conducted in miriad following a procedure outlined in zhang et al .",

    "figure [ cont_map ] presents the 1.3 mm continuum map , which reveals a cluster of nine mm cores , namely mm1 to mm9 in order of peak fluxes .",
    "measured parameters of these cores are listed in table [ mm_tbl ] . the brightest core mm1 coincides with the luminous ir and radio source irs 1 .",
    "the 1.3 mm continuum flux has a contribution of @xmath181.5 jy from the free - free emission extrapolated from cm measurements @xcite , and the dust emission flux is about 2.1 jy .",
    "the 1.3 mm emission from mm2 to mm9 is entirely dominated by the dust emission , since none of them is seen in cm continuum .",
    "in contrast to irs 1 , neither irs 2 nor irs 3 appears to be embedded within a dense dusty core .    assuming thermal equilibrium between the dense gas and dust , we adopt a temperature of 245 k for mm1 derived from a local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) model of the ch@xmath29cn emission ( section [ mm1_line ] ) .",
    "cores mm29 have much lower temperatures ; we estimate temperatures from nh@xmath29 data @xcite for mm69 ( section [ newmm_line ] ) and adopt an averaged temperature of 40 k for mm25 ( section [ cluster ] ) .",

    ", the uncertainty in extrapolating the free - free emission is also taken into account .",
    "for mm25 , an averaged uncertainty of @xmath35 is assumed for the adopted temperature .",
    "there is a systemic uncertainty , @xmath36 , introduced by the distance error ( 0.12 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "other uncertainties come from possible variations of the gas - to - dust mass ratio and the dust opacity ; the latter can be constrained with future high angular resolution observations at different wavelengths .",
    "figure [ co_int ] shows the velocity integrated co ( 21 ) emission obtained from the combined sma and jcmt data sets .",
    "velocity channel maps of the emission are shown in figure [ co_chan ] .",
    "overall the co emission shows spatially separated blue- and redshfited lobes in a nw - se orientation , whereas the detailed structures are ascribed to multiple outflows rather than a simple bipolar outflow seen in previous single - dish observations .    in the integrated map , the blueshifted lobe appears as a curved filament originating from mm1 and diverging into three `` branches '' toward the northwest , north , and northeast .",
    "however , from the orientation , the northeastern branch with a position angle ( pa ) of about 40@xmath37 is more likely arising from mm4 or irs 3 ; from the channel maps at @xmath38 to @xmath39 kms@xmath2 , the northern branch with a pa of about 0@xmath37 may originate from irs 3 or mm4 as well .",
    "in addition , at least four more dusty cores , mm2 , mm6 , mm7 , and mm8 appear to be associated with blueshifted co outflows : an elongated feature extending from mm6 to the southeast is seen in the integrated map and blueshifted channel maps of @xmath40@xmath38 kms@xmath2 ; emission around mm8 and extending to the northwest is seen in the integrated map and blueshifted channel maps of @xmath40@xmath41 kms@xmath2 ; emission associated with mm2 is seen as a knot to its immediate southwest at @xmath38 to @xmath42 kms@xmath2 and as a compact elongation at @xmath43 to @xmath44 kms@xmath2 ; compact and faint emission extending from mm7 to the southwest is visible at @xmath43 to @xmath45 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the redshifted emission appears as a large - scale `` arc '' in the integrated map , while the detailed structures can be attributed to at least two cores , mm1 and mm7 .",
    "mm1 is presumably the powering source of the emission extending from around mm1 to a bright clump about @xmath46 ( 0.26 pc ) to the southeast ; the clump is encompassed by a c - shaped structure seen in c@xmath47o ( 21 ) .",
    "mm7 is likely the central source of the co emission in its close vicinity : a knot about @xmath48 ( 0.09 pc ) to the northeast seen at @xmath49 and @xmath50 kms@xmath2 is most likely the redshifted counterpart of the compact feature seen at @xmath43 to @xmath45 kms@xmath2 ; a southwestern clump identifiable in the integrated map and channel maps of @xmath40@xmath51 kms@xmath2 is probably associated with mm7 as well .",
    "figures [ 13co_int ] and [ 13co_chan ] show the velocity integrated and channel maps , respectively , of the @xmath3co ( 21 ) emission , obtained from the combined sma and cso data . in general",
    "the @xmath3co emission shows a morphology similar to that of the co emission , but within a narrower velocity range .",
    "the mm1 nw - se outflow appears more predominant in the @xmath3co emission .",
    "although fainter , the pa@xmath52 and @xmath53 branches of the blueshifed emission are both identifiable .",
    "the redshifted emission of the mm7 outflow is clearly seen ; in particular in the channel map of @xmath51 kms@xmath2 it shows a bi - conical structure .    a schematic view of the multiple outflows detected here is shown in figure [ sketchy ] , which presents a tentative anatomy of the complicated outflow structures seen in co and @xmath3co ( 21 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion on the mm1 outflow is presented in section [ dis_outflow ] .",
    "following qiu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the outflow parameters , including the mass ( @xmath54 ) , momentum ( @xmath55 ) , energy ( @xmath56 ) , dynamical timescale ( @xmath57 ) , mass outflow rate ( @xmath58 ) and momentum outflow rate ( @xmath59 ) , are calculated . the optical depth effect as a function of velocity and spatial distribution",
    "is corrected by comparing the co with @xmath3co fluxes and adopting a c - to-@xmath3c ratio of 79 @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters are listed in table [ outflow_tbl ] . to avoid contamination from ambient diffuse gas",
    ", we conservatively calculate the mass of the outflowing gas at velocities of @xmath60@xmath39 and @xmath40@xmath51 kms@xmath2 , which are more than 6 kms@xmath2 away from the systemic velocity of @xmath61 kms@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , from figure [ co_chan ] , the emission at @xmath62 and @xmath63 kms@xmath2 has significant contribution from outflows . if we choose the lowest outflow velocities to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 kms@xmath2 , the gas mass amounts to 110 @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the total outflow mass should be in the range of 50 to 100 @xmath1 .",
    "mm1 shows molecular chemistry typical of a hot molecular core ( hmc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "excluding co and @xmath3co ( 21 ) , around 70 lines arising from 15 molecular species are detected toward mm1 with peak fluxes above 6@xmath64 ( table [ line_tbl ] ) .",
    "spatially unresolved emission from complex o - bearing molecules , e.g. , methyl formate ( ch@xmath29ocho ) and ethanol ( c@xmath65h@xmath66oh ) , and n - bearing molecules , e.g. , methyl cyanide ( ch@xmath29cn ) and isocyanic acid ( hnco ) , is clearly seen . in particular , the number of detected lines is largely dominated by o - bearing molecules , e.g. , ch@xmath29oh , ch@xmath29ocho , and c@xmath65h@xmath66oh .",
    "the ch@xmath29cn emission is an excellent temperature and density probe @xcite .",
    "the ch@xmath29cn lines detected in mm1 cover a wide range of upper level energies above the ground state , @xmath67 ( 69526 k ) .",
    "following qiu & zhang ( 2009 ) , we perform a simultaneous fitting to all the detected @xmath68 components of the ch@xmath29cn ( 1211 ) emission , where the temperature , column density , and source size are determined by means of grid search @xmath69-square minimization . in figure",
    "[ ch3cn ] , the best fit model agrees very well with the observation , and yields a temperature of 245@xmath70 k , a column density of 5@xmath7110@xmath72 @xmath73 , and a source size of 1450@xmath74 au . as the fitting is highly nonlinear , uncertainties are determined from a monte carlo analysis accounting for the 1@xmath64 noise and the @xmath1810% uncertainty of flux calibration .",
    "compared to the rotation diagram method , the fitting improves the parameter derivation by solving for the optical depths @xcite , which range from 0.16 for the @xmath68=8 line to 2.99 for the @xmath68=3 line in the best fit model .",
    "the fitting , however , simply assumes uniform gas .",
    "density and temperature gradients certainly exist in a gas and dust envelope surrounding a ( proto)star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit model thus represents a characteristic estimate .",
    "the beam - averaged ch@xmath29cn column density , 3@xmath1710@xmath75 @xmath73 , can be compared to the h@xmath65 column density ( 1.4@xmath1710@xmath76 @xmath73 , derived from the dust continuum peak ) for an estimate of the ch@xmath29cn abundance , which is 2.1@xmath17@xmath77 , in agreement with typical values of @xmath78@xmath79 measured in other hmcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the feature is not detected ( @xmath84 ) in lines of h@xmath85co , ch@xmath29oh , or any other large o - bearing molecules .",
    "the emission is probably arising from an interaction between the outflowing material and a clump residing in the far side of the central young o star .",
    "the lines in nitrogen- and sulfur - bearing species could be related to shock - induced chemistry , while the deficiency in lines of ch@xmath29oh , h@xmath85co , and larger o - bearing molecules could be due to an initially low abundance of the `` key '' species ch@xmath29oh and h@xmath65co for the clump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the existing observations can not shed further light on this issue .",
    "thought to be a probe of inward motion of dense gas surrounding a forming star , molecular lines with redshifted absorption observed at high - angular - resolutions have been reported in a very few high - mass star - forming cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "toward mm1 , an inverse p - cygni profile with redshifted absorption ( @xmath86@xmath87 ) is seen in lines of c@xmath47o ( 21 ) , so ( 5@xmath884@xmath66 ) , hnco ( 10@xmath899@xmath90 ) , ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath92)@xmath93 and ( 8@xmath947@xmath95)@xmath93 , and ch@xmath29cn ( 1211 ) @xmath68=2,3 ( see , e.g. , figure [ absorption ] ) . in these lines ,",
    "the absorption comes from dense gas lying on the near side of the central continuum source , absorbing bright continuum emission and moving toward the source ( away from the observer ) .",
    "meanwhile , the emission is attributed to dense gas residing on the far side of the central source and moving toward the observer ; within a @xmath21 beam , dense gas with velocities largely along the plane of sky ( i.e. , orthogonal to the line of sight ) can contribute to the emission as well .",
    "the lines showing redshifted absorption have @xmath67 spanning a range of 16133 k. roughly speaking , the absorption in lines of higher excitation ( e.g. , the ch@xmath29oh and ch@xmath29cn lines ) may trace inner , warmer gas with velocities mostly along the line of sight , hence appears more biased toward redshifted velocities .",
    "in addition , analytical models of a dense core under self - similar gravitational collapse shows that the infall velocity scales with the radius as @xmath96 @xcite , which may partly contribute to the redward shift of the absorption in lines of higher @xmath67 . assuming the collapse proceeds in a spherical geometry , the accretion rate can be estimated following @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath99 the radius of the infalling envelope , @xmath100 the mass density , and @xmath101 the infall velocity . from the dust continuum peak",
    "the h@xmath65 number density is about @xmath102 @xmath103 averaged over @xmath104 au .",
    "the measured infall velocity is about 2.5 kms@xmath2 . as an order - of - magnitude estimate , @xmath98",
    "amounts to @xmath105 @xmath106 .",
    "however , the accretion may considerably deviate from a spherical geometry , in particular for the inner part closely surrounding the central source .",
    "the free - free emission in irs 1 shows a double - lobed morphology at the center , suggesting that the accretion proceeds along a flattened structure perpendicular to the ionized gas elongation .",
    "if the collapse occurs inside a solid angle @xmath107 , @xmath98 scales to @xmath108 @xmath109 .",
    "in addition to mm1 , the dust continuum map reveals eight new cores , mm29 .",
    "the c@xmath47o ( 21 ) , so ( 5@xmath884@xmath66 ) , and ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath110 ) _ e _ lines show emission from part of these new cores and extended structures , and are not significantly affected by outflows or ambient diffuse gas .",
    "figure [ mom0 ] shows moment-0 ( velocity averaged ) maps of these lines .",
    "the c@xmath47o ( 21 ) emission is dominated by two dense clumps residing on both sides of an absorption feature around mm1 : the western clump peaks at mm2 and shows extension from mm5 to mm4 ; the eastern clump encompasses mm3 and mm6 .",
    "while mm2 coincides with the brightest c@xmath47o peak , cores mm36 are more or less offset from local c@xmath47o peaks .",
    "another interesting feature in c@xmath47o is a c - shaped shell seen in the southeast of the mm cores . in comparison with the co and @xmath3co ( 21 ) emission ,",
    "the c@xmath47o shell lies immediately ahead of the brightest and furthest co/@xmath3co clump in the redshifted outflow ( see figure [ co_int ] and figure [ 13co_int ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the c - shaped structure forms from ambient gas which is compressed by the outflow from mm1 .",
    "apart from emission and absorption toward mm1 , the so ( 5@xmath884@xmath66 ) map shows bright emission around mm2 , mm3 , mm6 , mm8 , mm9 , as well as faint extensions toward mm4 and mm5 .",
    "the so map also shows clumps without a counterpart in the dust continuum ; for example , two bright clumps to the southeast of mm6 are not seen in dust continuum or any other line .",
    "it is unclear whether the so emission in the two clumps is associated with the mm6 outflow or arising from protostellar cores whose dust continuum is below the detection limit of our sma observation .",
    "compared to c@xmath47o ( 21 ) and so ( 5@xmath884@xmath66 ) , the ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath110 ) _ e _ line has a considerably higher @xmath67 ( 89 k ) and appears to trace more compact structures .",
    "in addition to mm1 , cores mm3 , mm6 , mm7 , mm8 , and mm9 are clearly detected in this line .",
    "the ch@xmath29oh peaks approximately coincide with the dust continuum peaks , indicating the presence of internal heating within each of the detected cores .",
    "relatively faint emission associated with mm5 is detected as well .    a serendipitous discovery from the ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath110 ) _ e _ map is a new 229.8 ghz maser at ( r.a . , decl.)@xmath111 , which is seen as unresolved and bright emission with a peak flux of @xmath181.64 jybeam@xmath2 and a narrow line width of less than 2 kms@xmath2 ( figure [ mom0]c and figure [ maser ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to assess whether this maser spot is associated with any of the mm continuum sources which are more than 0.2 pc away .",
    "another possibility is that the maser is associated with a compact ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath110 ) _ e _ and so ( 5@xmath884@xmath66 ) clump about 5@xmath27 to the north .",
    "the clump probably traces a low- to intermediate - mass protostellar core whose 1.3 mm dust emission is below the detection limit of our sma observation .",
    "more interestingly , the maser spot lies right at the tip of a compact co outflow ( figure [ co_int ] ) , suggesting that the masing line is pumped by the outflow shocks , which is consistent with the class i property of the transition .",
    "there has been very few report on the detection of 229.8 ghz methanol maser @xcite , probably because of its high frequency hence not covered by previous methanol maser surveys .    in the vla nh@xmath29 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) data taken by zheng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , emission in mm69 is clearly seen in both transitions ( see figure [ nh3_mm69 ] ) , while an investigation of emission in mm25 is severely affected by predominant absorption arising from mm1 . as there is no clear detection of a satellite line in figure [ nh3_mm69 ]",

    "we obtain @xmath112 of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 k for mm69 , respectively ; the uncertainties account for the @xmath120 noise of the spectra .",
    "correcting for the depopulation effect @xcite , we estimate the kinetic temperatures from @xmath112 to be 43 , 58 , 54 , and 38 k for mm69 , respectively .",
    "the mm1 core has a size of about 0.05 pc , an h@xmath65 number density of order @xmath102 @xmath103 , a characteristic temperature of 245 k , and rich chemistry in complex organic molecules .",
    "all these indicate that mm1 is a typical hmc . on the other hand",

    "the @xmath1820 @xmath1 core , however , is not equivalent to the gas reservoir of the accretion . on the one hand , myers ( 2009 ) found that clustered and high - density regions form high - mass protostars from both core and environment gas .",

    "the nh@xmath29 absorption is optically thick ( @xmath122 , henkel et al .",
    "1984 ; keto 1991 ) , presumably tracing gas mostly residing in outer layers surrounding the hmc .",
    "thus the bulk of the outer gas appears to be in an outward motion .",
    "on the other hand , various mechanisms , e.g. , outflows , heating and ionization , and accretion by nearby protostars , can disperse dense gas and conspire to terminate the accretion @xcite .",
    "in particular , keto ( 2007 ) described a three - stage evolutionary sequence of an hii region around a massive young star . in his model ,",
    "the dynamics and morphology of the ionized gas are determined by the ratio of the ionization radius , @xmath123 , and the gravitational radius , @xmath124 , defined by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the mass of the star and @xmath127 is the sound speed . with @xmath128 @xmath1 and @xmath129 kms@xmath2 ( for ionized gas temperature of @xmath130 k ) ,",

    "multiple outflows are seen in the co and @xmath3co maps . however , the bulk outflowing gas is centered at the brightest core mm1 which harbors the irs 1 young o star . as outlined in figure",
    "[ sketchy ] , the blueshifted lobe of the mm1 outflow is dominated by a slightly curved filament with a pa of about @xmath133 . in sub - arcsec resolution observations ,",

    "in addition , near - ir observations toward irs 1 reveals a fan - shaped structure ( opening angle @xmath137 ) extending from irs 1 to the northwest ( @xmath138 , * ? ? ? * ) . on a larger scale ,",
    "the co/@xmath3co filament is seen projected against a dense clump revealed by the nh@xmath29 emission ( see figure [ sketchy ] ) .",
    "the most likely scenario capable of incorporating the inner ionized gas with a north - south orientation and the northwestern structure extending from 500 au to 0.5 pc from the central source seems to be a wide - angle wind from irs 1 which carves an outflow cavity .",
    "the axis of the wide - angle wind is mostly along the north - south orientation and slightly inclined to the west .",
    "the northwestern structure observed in radio , mid - ir , and in co and @xmath3co ( 21 ) emission traces the western wall of the outflow cavity .",
    "the lack of appreciable emission from the eastern wall is likely ascribed to the deficiency of dense gas to the northeast of irs 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , from a close inspection of the ionized gas and hot dust immediately around irs 1 , faint extension to the northeast does exist as well ( figure 2 in campbell 1984 ; figure 1b in gaume et al .",

    "@xcite , there appears to be no dense gas immediately to the west of the structure , excluding the possibility of being confined by ambient dense gas . from figure",
    "[ sketchy ] , the wide - angle wind seems to be expanding into an ambient dense clump seen in nh@xmath29 and as a consequence of this interaction , part of the gas is deflected to the north , forming the pa@xmath180@xmath37 structure .",
    "however , with the existing data it can not be ruled out that the structure is associated with irs 3 or mm4 .",
    "it is not straightforward either to unambiguously identify and interpret the redshifted lobe of the mm1 outflow . in the wide - angle wind scenario",
    "proposed above , the structure mostly consists of ambient gas being entrained or swept up by the wide - angle wind and tracing the eastern wall of the southern outflow cavity . the slightly distorted appearance of the structure could be partly caused by interaction with other outflows ( e.g. , the mm7 outflow ) .",
    "an interesting feature is the c - shaped shell seen in c@xmath47o .",
    "it lies ahead of the furthest and brightest co/@xmath3co clump and features dense gas being compressed by part of the leading front of the wide - angle wind .",
    "it is puzzling that the western wall of the southern outflow cavity is unseen in co or @xmath3co , as at least in projection dense gas to the southwest of mm1 is seen in nh@xmath29 and dust continuum .",
    "one possibility is that in a three - dimensional picture the southern lobe of the wide - angle wind is expanding into a medium without dense gas in the west and can not produce appreciable emission .",
    "hollenbach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) studied the photoevaporation of disks around massive young stars and developed a model of the photoevaporative wind from the disk .",
    "lugo et al . ( 2004 ) performed a parametric investigation of such a wind in ngc 7538 irs 1 by modeling the free - free emission as arising from the wind and found a mass - loss rate of @xmath139 @xmath1yr@xmath2 . as the speed of the photoevaporative wind",
    "is @xmath181050 kms@xmath2 @xcite , comparable to that of co outflows , the mass loss rate of the wind seems too low to drive the ngc 7538 irs 1 outflow , whose mass loss rate is of order @xmath0 @xmath1yr@xmath2 ( table [ outflow_tbl ] ) .",
    "the photoevaporative wind may play a role in driving the irs 1 molecular outflow , however , the large amount of gas mass , momentum , and energy in outflowing gas requires a more energetic wind as its driving engine . in a _ momentum - driven _ picture ( working like a snow - plow ) , a fast , @xmath181000 kms@xmath2 wind with a mass loss rate of @xmath140 @xmath1yr@xmath2 is able to drive the observed molecular outflow ; in an _ energy - driven _ situation ( working by ram pressure ) , the required mass loss rate is much lower , i.e. , @xmath141 @xmath1yr@xmath2 , provided the wind speed reaches 1000 kms@xmath2 .",
    "stellar winds from o stars and possible accretion - driven winds ( e.g. , a high - mass analogue of _ x_-winds in low - mass protostars ) are expected to have velocities reaching @xmath181000 kms@xmath2 , and energy - wise , are likely to drive the massive and energetic molecular outflow .      in single - dish submm and mm continuum maps of the ngc 7538 complex , the most remarkable cloud",
    "has a size of about 1 pc and slightly extends to the southeast @xcite .",
    "star formation activity within this cloud has long been thought to be concentrated around irs 13 , and irs 1 is the source that attracted most of the interest .",
    "our sma 1.3 mm continuum observation uncovers a total of nine cores with a spatial distribution roughly following the shape of the cloud . apart from mm1 , which harbors the irs 1 young o star , cores mm29 are new detections .",
    "the detection of these dusty cores is interesting in the context of cloud fragmentation and cluster formation .    for mm1 , with a number density of @xmath142 @xmath103 ( averaged within a beam and assuming a spherical geometry ) and a temperature of 245 k ,",
    "one derives a thermal jeans mass ( @xmath143 ) of 17 @xmath1 , which is comparable to the measured core mass and compatible with the scenario that heating from the forming star may have helped to suppress fragmentation of the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , all the new cores are very young , apparently lacking significant heating .",
    "these cores are not detected in ch@xmath29cn , and only part of them are seen in one transition of ch@xmath29oh ( see figure [ mom0 ] ) . for mm69 ,",
    "the nh@xmath29 data reveal temperatures of order 50 k ( section [ newmm_line ] ) . for mm25 , a rough upper limit may be obtained based on the absence of ch@xmath29cn emission , which is a typical thermometer of hmcs .",
    "for example , cores mm25 have masses close to mm1 ; if the abundance ratio and spatial distribution of ch@xmath29cn in mm25 resembles that in mm1 , at a temperature of 100 k , the brightness temperature ( averaged within a beam of @xmath21 ) of the ch@xmath29cn ( 1211 ) @xmath68=03 emission in mm25 would be about 24 k , which could have been detected at a @xmath144 level .",
    "alternatively , with the ch@xmath29cn ( 1211 ) @xmath68-ladder observed with the sma , qiu & zhang ( 2009 ) derived a temperature of 110 k for a hmc in the hh 80 - 81 massive star - forming region ; if the hh 80 - 81 hmc were at a distance of 2.65 kpc and observed with a @xmath21 beam , the brightness temperature of the @xmath68=0,1 components would have been around 1 k ; cores mm25 in ngc 7538 have masses comparable to that of the hh 8081 hmc , while the ch@xmath29cn emission is not detected ( @xmath145 k ) .",
    "all this indicates that mm25 have temperatures well below 100 k. sandell & sievers ( 2004 ) found a dust temperature of 40 k for submm condensations around irs 1 .",
    "this probably provides a rough estimate of the averaged temperature of mm29 , as part of them roughly coincide with the submm condensations .",
    "mm29 have number densities of @xmath146@xmath147 @xmath103 , or mass column densities @xmath148 g@xmath73 , matching a proposed threshold of 1 g@xmath73 for molecular clouds capable of avoiding fragmentation and forming massive stars @xcite .",
    "but the masses of the new cores are well above @xmath143 , implying the importance of supersonic turbulence and/or magnetic field in cloud fragmentation and possible star formation within the new cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while an investigation of the magnetic field awaits new observations , a glimpse of turbulence can be obtained by looking into the emission lines arising from these cores .",
    "figure [ linwid ] shows spectra in c@xmath47o ( 21 ) , so ( 5@xmath884@xmath66 ) , and ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath110 ) _ e _ at the peaks of mm29 .",
    "a gaussian fitting is performed on lines with sufficient signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the derived line widths of @xmath182.54 kms@xmath2 are more than 5 times larger than the thermal line width .",
    "this strongly suggests the presence of supersonic turbulence which may play an important role in suppressing fragmentation , if the line widths are not dominated by kinematics related to star formation processes ( e.g. , outflow , infall , and rotation ) .",
    "information on potential ongoing star formation within the new cores can be obtained from their associations with co outflows , h@xmath65o masers , and warm and dense gas condensations .",
    "cores mm2 , mm3 , mm4 , and",
    "mm7 are all associated with h@xmath65o maser emission ( figure [ cont_map ] ) , indicative of active star formation .",
    "cores mm2 , mm6 , mm7 , mm8 , and probably mm4 as well , are associated with co outflows ( figure [ sketchy ] and section [ outflow ] ) , implying the presence of protostars within these cores .",
    "mm9 shows the faintest dust continuum ; although lacking apparent association with an outflow or h@xmath65o maser spot , it is very likely internally heated by an intermediate - mass protostar as it shows centrally peaked emission in ch@xmath29oh and so ( figure [ mom0 ] ) .",
    "there is no clear signature of star formation toward mm5 , which also shows a relatively flattened profile in dust emission .",
    "it is more likely a gas and dust clump externally heated by irs 2 ( probably through a stellar - wind bow shock , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than an internally heated star - forming core .",
    "in short , seven out of the eight new cores appear to be forming stars .",
    "the star - forming cores have masses of @xmath14924 @xmath1 and high densities , and most of them show bright , centrally peaked ch@xmath29oh emission .",
    "although ch@xmath29oh lines are seen in hot corinos ( warm and dense envelopes around low - mass protostars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission could not be detected if the hot corinos were at distances @xmath150 kpc as compared to the case of iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "thus , the new cores seen in ch@xmath29oh are expected to be forming intermediate- to high - mass stars .",
    "mm4 is not detected in ch@xmath29oh and its immediate northwest is deficient of emission in c@xmath47o and so ; molecular line emission from this core is probably hampered by uv radiation from irs 3 , which has begun to ionize the surrounding and is not heavily obscured by a dusty cocoon .",
    "mm2 is the most massive of the new cores and coincides with the brightest c@xmath47o peak , but is not seen in ch@xmath29oh . with a relatively low @xmath67 ( 16 k ) , the c@xmath47o ( 21 ) emission preferentially traces column density enhancements rather than temperature increase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ch@xmath29oh ( 8@xmath917@xmath92 ) @xmath93 emission ( with a much higher @xmath67 of 89 k ) is more sensitive to the heating .",
    "therefore , mm2 is presumably the youngest of the new star - forming cores .",
    "the ngc 7538 molecular complex has been thought to exhibit sequential massive star formation propagating from northwest to southeast @xcite . in this picture , the irs 13 region lies ahead of the ionization front of the optical hii region and represents an intermediate evolutionary phase between the ionizing stars of the hii region in the northwest and deeply embedded massive protostars in the southeast ( i.e. , ngc 7538 s and irs 9 , * ? ? ?",

    "our sma observations provide new insights into this scenario . with the newly discovered star - forming cores , the irs 1",
    "young o star is not only accompanied by more evolved sources irs 2 and irs 3 , but also surrounded by a group of intermediate- to high - mass protostars distributed over the parent cloud .",
    "there is no pronounced propagation of star formation across the cloud . in comparison with massive protostars in irs 9 or",
    "ngc 7538 s , irs 13 are certainly more evolved , but all the newly discovered star - forming cores are at very young evolutionary stages .",
    "in particular mm2 , which is the closest to mm1 , is apparently younger than irs 9 , which is visible in the near- to mid - ir @xcite , and even younger than ngc 7538 s , which shows bright ch@xmath29cn emission @xcite .",
    "the pc - sized cloud appears to be in an active phase of cluster formation , with around 10 ob - type stars and probably orders of magnitude more low - mass stars according to a typical imf ( initial mass function , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , within the volume occupied by high- and intermediate - mass protostars described above , kraus et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in their 2.2 @xmath151 m speckle images found a number of weak , compact sources .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that these are already more evolved lower mass members of the same forming star cluster of which irs 13 and the new protostars ( mm24 and mm69 ) define the higher mass end of the mass distribution . here",
    ", a comparison with the well - studied orion nebular cluster ( onc ) is instructive .",
    "as argued by palla & stahler ( 1999 ) and huff & stahler ( 2006 ) , the highest mass onc member stars comprising the `` trapezium '' at the center of the cluster are @xmath152 yr old , while the bulk of the lower mass cluster members formed 13 million years ago . in fact",
    ", one may consider irs 13 , mm24 and mm6 to be a trapezium system in formation . the maximal physical separation between these objects , 0.30 pc , is much larger than the maximal separation between members of the onc trapezium , 0.047 pc , i.e. , between @xmath153  ori  d and @xmath153  ori  e , assuming a distance of 417 pc to the onc @xcite .",
    "it is , however , well within the range of other trapezium - type systems . a trapezium - type system , as defined by ambartsumian ( 1954 ; 1955 ; 1958 ) , of which @xmath153  ori is the prototype , is a multiple star whose separations are all roughly of the same order of magnitude . while their cosmogonic role is somewhat unclear , it is a well - established fact that such systems are frequently found as the highest mass systems at the centers of clusters of lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "a catalog of 87 trapezia with maximum separations , @xmath154 , within 0.2 pc was published by salukvadze ( 1978 ) , while salukvadze & dzhavakhishvili ( 1988 ) reported 15 wider systems with @xmath154 between 1.1 and 5.7 pc .",
    "thus the dimensions of the nascent ngc 7538 irs 1 trapezium are well comparable to values generally found for such systems .",
    "we present a 23@xmath27 resolution study in the 1.3 mm waveband of the well - known massive star - forming region ngc 7538 irs 13 .",
    "the gas and dust core mm1 , which harbors the irs 1 young o star , is massive ( @xmath155 @xmath1 ) , hot ( @xmath156 k ) , and shows bright line emission in complex organic molecules .",
    "redshifted absorption seen in several high - density tracing lines indicates that the central young o star or star - disk system is still accreting gas from mm1 . in comparison with a theoretical model on early evolution of hii regions",
    "@xcite , the accretion seems to be confined to a narrow range of angle about the equatorial plane .",
    "sensitive and high - angular - resolution observations also reveal eight new cores mm29 embedded within the parent cloud of irs 13 .",
    "these cores have masses much larger than the thermal jeans mass , indicating the importance of turbulence and/or magnetic field in cloud fragmentation .",
    "the cores are seen in one or more of the c@xmath47o ( 21 ) , so ( @xmath157@xmath158 ) , and ch@xmath29oh ( @xmath159@xmath160 ) _ e _ lines ; the line widths are significantly larger than the thermal line width , attributed to supersonic turbulence and/or kinematics related to ongoing star formation .",
    "seven out of the eight cores appear to be forming intermediate- to high - mass stars , of which the most massive ones appear to be members of a nascent trapezium system .",
    "characterized by the deeply embedded young o star irs 1 , two moderately obscured sources irs 2 and irs 3 , and seven new intermediate- to high - mass protostellar cores , and taking into account presumably more unseen low - mass ( proto)stars , a massive cluster is forming from a pc - sized cloud exposed to the ionization front of an optical hii region .",
    "the co and @xmath3co maps obtained from the combined sma and single - dish data reveals an outflow scenario far more complicated than a bipolar outflow seen in single - dish observations .",
    "multiple outflows are seen , and the mm1/irs 1 outflow is dominating the mass of 50 @xmath1 , momentum of @xmath161 @xmath1 kms@xmath2 , and energy of @xmath162 erg calculated for the gas moving at velocities of @xmath163 kms@xmath2 and @xmath164 kms@xmath2 . comparing our co , @xmath3co maps with the existing radio and ir observations we suggest that the mm1/irs 1 molecular outflow is likely driven by a wide - angle wind from the forming o star or star - disk system , and the wind is expanding into a medium with inhomogeneous density distribution , creating asymmetric and curved structures seen in co/@xmath3co .",
