    "if the number density of particles is very large , the macroscopic description in terms of continuous fields is typically appropriate . a well established approach to model the spatio - temporal evolution of the population density field , @xmath1 , is in terms of a reaction - diffusion equation that , in one spatial dimension , reads @xmath2 in the above equation , @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath4 rules the chemical kinetics or , in the language of population biology , the local rate of population growth .",
    "a well known growth term is the logistic model @xmath5 whose quadratic term models the competition for resources , @xmath6 being the local carrying capacity ( i.e. the maximal population density that can be sustained ) while @xmath7 denotes the intrinsic growth rate .",
    "conversely , if the density of particles is not very large the discrete nature of the population can not be neglected  @xcite , new effects arise and the continuous description becomes inaccurate . in order to account for the new effects several approaches",
    "are possible .",

    "another possibility is to supplement eq .",
    "( [ eq : rd ] ) with a noise term accounting for microscopic fluctuations originated by the finite number of individuals  @xcite .",
    "a further modeling step is to consider a lattice where each site is occupied by an integer number of individuals  @xcite , or a contact process ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) , where each site is occupied at most by an individual .",
    "in the present work , we consider a system of particles diffusing in space and interacting when they get within a given interaction distance .",
    "in particular , revisiting the continuous kiss model , after kierstead , slobodkin and skellam @xcite , we investigate the effects induced by discreteness on the dynamics of a population inhabiting a favorable region ( `` an oasis '' ) surrounded by a deadly environment ( `` a desert '' ) .",
    "accounting for such effects is important to assess the role of demographic and environmental stochasticity on extinction dynamics  @xcite .",
    "several efforts have already been undertaken along this direction within the framework of the kiss model .",
    "some model modifications that include effects of intrinsic variability on the critical habitat size ensuring population persistence have been studied in relation to environmental stochasticity @xcite . as for demographic stochasticity due to population discreteness",

    "@xcite , or within a stochastic framework using field theory techniques  @xcite . in our work",
    ", we adopt a discrete particle model @xcite focusing on demographic stochasticity effects .",
    "moreover , our study is not restricted to steady state properties but also deals with dynamical features of extinction phenomena .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : surv ] we recall the continuous kiss model  @xcite and introduce its discrete analogue .",
    "in section  [ sec : qss ] we numerically study the long time properties of the discrete model , characterizing the so - called quasi - stationary state @xcite , and comparing it with the properties of the continuous model .",
    "section  [ sec : mte ] is devoted to the problem of determining the critical habitat size for population persistence and to the estimation of extinction times in the discrete particle system . discussions and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] . as a side discussion , in the appendix we briefly consider the effects of changes of the microscopic rules of the discrete model .",
    "determining the conditions for persistence or , conversely , estimating the probability of extinction of species and populations is a question of paramount importance in population biology .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the problem was initiated by kierstead , skellam and slobodkin @xcite who considered a population that , ruled by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rd]-[eq : logistic ] ) , grows with rate @xmath7 and diffuses with diffusion coefficient @xmath3 within a patch of size @xmath0 surrounded by a deadly environment . for a given growth rate ,",
    "higher diffusivities imply larger fluxes across the boundaries , so that larger patches are necessary to compensate the population loss in order to allow stable persistence .",
    "it is then natural to determine the minimal ( critical ) patch size , @xmath10 , ensuring population persistence .",
    "at least dimensionally , the critical patch size can be obtained by balancing the growth rate @xmath7 with the exit rate from the patch due to diffusion @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this way one derives that @xmath12 that is the correct result up to an order one constant ( see below ) .    in one - dimensional space , for simplicity ,",
    "it is enough to consider eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rd]-[eq : logistic ] ) in the interval @xmath13 , representing the favorable patch , while the outside hostile environment results in the boundary conditions @xmath14    detailed analysis of the kiss model can be found in @xcite , for generalizations of the model including different kind of population growth terms see @xcite .",
    "here , we only recall the main results on the critical patch size .",
    "we notice that , close to the extinction , the population density will be very small ( @xmath15 ) so that we can linearize the growth term ( [ eq : logistic ] ) by posing @xmath16 .",
    "starting from a generic initial condition , population density will thus grow ( decay ) depending on the positive ( negative ) sign of the largest eigenvalue @xmath17 of the ( linear ) operator @xmath18 with boundary conditions  ( [ eq : ckiss_bc ] ) .",

    "consequently , the population can persist only if the favorable habitat is larger than the critical patch size @xmath10 .",
    "however , while in the linear case also the eigenfunctions and thus the stationary population density can be easily derived , for the logistic case only approximate solutions are known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that proper estimations of @xmath10 , with suitable generalizations of the above model , are used in the design of protected areas for endangered species , in the context of conservation biology  @xcite .    in the following we focus on the logistic growth case . for later convenience",
    "it is useful to formulate the continuous model ( [ eq : rd]-[eq : logistic ] ) in non - dimensional variables . from the above analysis it is natural to measure time in units of the inverse growth rate @xmath21 and space in units of @xmath22 . finally , normalizing the population density to the carrying capacity , that is introducing @xmath23 , we can rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rd]-[eq : logistic ] ) as @xmath24 with @xmath25 , where @xmath0 now is the non - dimensional domain size . with these units the critical patch size is @xmath26 .      in recent years",
    ", several efforts have been devoted to the extinction problem in populations with a finite number , @xmath8 , of individuals , using non - spatial models  @xcite .",
    "the factors influencing extinction , through fluctuations and decline of a population , are in principle extremely varied and attributable to a wide class of biological and environmental causes , among which demographic stochasticity  @xcite , associated to the unavoidable random occurrence of birth and death events , is one of the most important ones .    in the context of spatially extended systems",
    ", some effects of demographic stochasticity on steady patterns of populations have been analyzed using different models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the discreteness was modeled using reaction - diffusion equations with a cutoff on the growth term , and it was found that the critical patch size for survival is larger than in the model without cutoff . a similar effect was found also in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a stochastic discrete model , where it is shown that the population can go extinct above the critical patch size of the continuous model and an `` effective '' ( finite ) critical patch size can be introduced only when the competition term is weak enough . in our study , similarly to @xcite , the discrete population can go extinct for habitat sizes guaranteeing the persistence in the continuous case .",
    "however , we will always refer to the critical patch size of the continuous model @xmath10 because , as we will see , this value still marks a transition in the system behavior .",
    "we now introduce a discrete version of the kiss model , generalizing the stochastic particle model of ref .  @xcite . as an essential prerequisite , when the number of particles is large",
    ", the model must reproduce the fkpp ( fisher - kolmogorov - petrovskii - piskunov ) dynamics @xmath27 ( i.e. , eq .  ( [ eq : ckiss_lo_nd ] ) in the dimensional version ) . the fkpp equation can be derived from two coupled reaction - diffusion equations for the concentrations @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the species undergoing the autocatalytic reaction @xmath30 summing the dynamical equation for @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) with that for @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ) gives the fkpp equation , provided @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( i.e. local mass conservation ) .",
    "we discretize these reaction - diffusion equations passing from the concentrations @xmath35 to a particle description .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath36 particles of type @xmath37 and @xmath38 of type @xmath39 , with @xmath40 fixed .",
    "all the particles undergo independent diffusive processes with the same diffusion coefficient , @xmath3 , within the favorable patch @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "their positions @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) diffuse with diffusion coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "as for the interaction between particles , a simple way to implement the interaction term @xmath44 is to impose that a particle of type @xmath37 changes into @xmath39 with a probability rate @xmath45 depending on the intrinsic rate , @xmath7 , and on the number of @xmath39 particles within an interaction distance @xmath46 .",
    "this is mathematically formalized by the expression @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the number of @xmath39-particles within a distance @xmath46 from the given @xmath37-particle located at @xmath42 , and @xmath49 the average number of particles ( regardless their type ) within the interaction interval of length @xmath50 ( @xmath51 being the particle density ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , whenever the local particle density is large enough , the probabilistic rule above described converges to the fkpp equation",
    ". finally , we have to fix the behavior of @xmath37- and @xmath39- particles at the boundaries . in order to reproduce the boundary conditions of the kiss model and locally ensuring mass conservation",
    ", we impose the following rules : @xmath37 particles hitting the boundaries are reflected ( nutrients are present only within the patch ) , if a @xmath39 particle hits the boundary it is absorbed ( as it can not survive outside the favorable patch ) and it is replaced in - place by an @xmath37-particle .",
    "the @xmath37 particles are used as `` auxiliary '' particles in order to recover as a limit the continuous fkpp model . from an ecological perspective , considering the @xmath37 particles as nutrient , it would be interesting to study the case in which @xmath37 and @xmath39 particles diffuse with different diffusion coefficients .",
    "clearly , in this case the fkpp can not be expected to be the proper continuous description . here",
    "we limit our discussion to the case of same diffusion coefficients for the two species of particles . in the appendinx ,",
    "however , as an example we briefly consider the case of non - diffusing @xmath37 particles .    from the algorithmic point of view",
    ", the above model consists of two basic steps : the diffusive step  in which all particle positions @xmath52 ( @xmath43 ) evolve according to the dynamics @xmath53 , with @xmath54 independent normal random variables ; and the reaction step  in which , for each @xmath37-particle , one counts all the @xmath39-particles within a distance @xmath46 and changes @xmath37 in @xmath39 with probability @xmath55 . whenever the time step @xmath56 is small enough",
    "the order in which the two steps are performed is irrelevant .",
    "the main difference between the continuous model and the discrete one is that while the ( continuous ) stationary state @xmath57 becomes unstable above the critical patch size , the ( discrete ) absorbing state @xmath58 can always be reached due to demographic stochasticity . in the following sections we will investigate in depth this issue . here",
    ", we simply observe that the presence of an absorbing state forces us to perform ensemble averages in numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , our simulations consist of a large number , @xmath59 , of statistically independent realizations . as for initial conditions ,",
    "each realization starts with @xmath60 particles of each type uniformly distributed within the patch .",
    "each realization is then followed until the absorbing state ( @xmath58 ) is reached .",
    "the interaction distance , @xmath46 , is chosen to be small compared to the size of the favorable patch but large enough to contain some particles on average ( @xmath61 ) , which provides a lower bound on the minimum number of particles that one can consider , typically @xmath62 . in all simulations we set @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 so that we have as reference in the continuum limit the non - dimensional equation  ( [ eq : ckiss_lo_nd ] ) .",
    "finally , the time step , @xmath56 , is chosen small enough such that the diffusive step is much smaller that the interaction distance ( i.e. @xmath66 ) . here ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath67 .",
    "we notice that the model is robust with respect to small changes of @xmath46 , while if @xmath46 becomes comparable with the patch size relevant differences arise , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "there , we also briefly consider the subtle effects caused by modifications to the rules specifying the dynamics of the individual - based model .",

    "( color online ) mean extinction time @xmath121 as a function of the patch size @xmath0 for @xmath145 ( red circles ) , @xmath146 ( orange triangles ) and @xmath147 ( blue squares ) . in the inset @xmath148 versus @xmath0",
    "is compared to the asymptotic prediction ( [ eq : te_ext_l ] ) ( solid black curve ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks the critical value @xmath149 .",
    "the number of realizations used for the averages ranges from @xmath100 to @xmath132 depending on the value of @xmath8 . ]",
    "we conclude briefly discussing the dependence of @xmath121 on @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) . when @xmath85 , the extinction time @xmath121 is mainly controlled by the eigenvalue @xmath17 of the continuous kiss model . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : te_ext ] ) , using the expression of @xmath17 we have @xmath150 which is in fairly good agreement with the numerical data when @xmath8 is large ( inset of fig .  [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "we studied an individual - based reaction - diffusion system of ecological interest .",
    "we focused on a model of a discrete population in a favorable patch , surrounded by a deadly environment , which recovers the kiss model in the continuum limit .",
    "the presence of an absorbing state together with demographic stochasticity makes population extinction possible even when the continuous model would allow for population survival .",
    "in such a case , however , the system attains a quasi - stationary state that we have investigated at varying the system and population sizes . we have shown that above the kiss critical patch size the biomass in the quasi - stationary state recovers the continuum limit value only if the population is large enough . on the other hand , when the population has a small number of individuals , the link between biomasses , defined in the continuous and particle models , ceases to exist .",
    "in particular , when the patch size tends to the critical value the number of individuals required to recover the continuum limit diverges .    moreover , we have shown that the transition from extinction to survival translates , in the discrete model , in the transition from a logarithmic to an exponential dependence of the average time to extinction , @xmath121 , at varying the population size , @xmath8 . at the transition ,",
    "these two behaviors are separated by a power - law dependence @xmath151 with an exponent definitively different from the analytical prediction obtained in the non - spatial logistic model .",
    "we conclude mentioning that it would be interesting in the future to investigate the effects of population discreteness in more complex heterogeneous environments @xcite and possibly in the presence of advection @xcite . in such cases , besides the survival / extinction transition , we expect that the discreteness of the population will impact in nontrivial ways on the spatial propagation properties of the population .",
    "in this appendix we consider how two different modifications in the individual - based model affect the system dynamics : the first one regards variations of the interaction distance @xmath46  in order to check the robustness of the particle model , the second one regards particles motility and consists in considering fixed a particles  to investigate changes in the continuum limit .     for @xmath123 at varying @xmath46 as from the legend and considering non - motile a - particles .",
    "the power law behavior @xmath152 , identifying the extinction / survival transition , is robust for variations of the interaction distance around the reference value @xmath63 ; for much larger values ( @xmath153 ) the critical behavior is considerably altered .",
    "the same happens if one considers a model in which particles of type @xmath37 do not move ( filled diamonds ) . ]",
    "the interaction distance @xmath46 is a crucial parameter for the individual - based model and it is associated to fluctuations of the number of individuals .",
    "a significant variation of @xmath46 should thus have important consequences , through its impact on the effective growth rate . in figure  [ fig:7 ]",
    "we present a comparison between numerical results obtained in the reference case @xmath63 , used in this study , and those obtained with different values of @xmath46 . for illustrative purposes",
    "only , we focus on the average extinction time as a function of @xmath8 by fixing @xmath0 at the critical value @xmath10 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the power - law scaling @xmath151 ( with @xmath154 ) , and hence also the value of the critical patch size in the discrete model , is robust if the interaction distance varies within the same order of magnitude ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) .",
    "the situation is different when @xmath46 becomes comparable with the patch size : @xmath121 is no longer described by a power law ( see the case @xmath153 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) meaning that the discrete model is no longer at the critical point . indeed at large @xmath8 the curve @xmath157 bends towards a logarithmic shape as in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] when @xmath85 .",
    "actually , a similar tendency towards smaller values of @xmath121 characterizes the large @xmath8 behavior for @xmath156 , although the effect is so weak that it is difficult to be seen in the figure .",
    "the faster extinction is likely due to the fact that increasing @xmath46 causes the hostile boundary conditions to be felt deeper inside the favorable patch . in other words , while on average the number of particles within @xmath46 gets larger , the fraction of @xmath39 particles does not , due to its depletion close to the boundary .",
    "as for the modifications of the motility of particles , we study a case in which @xmath37 particles are fixed , and the only other change in the particle model is that , in order to preserve the total number of individuals when a @xmath39 particle is absorbed at the boundary , a new @xmath37 particle is introduced at a random position ( uniformly in the patch ) .",
    "this model has a biological justification in the case in which individuals of type @xmath37 ( the nutrient ) are non - motile ( e.g. a plant species ) and individuals of type @xmath39 belong to a motile species feeding on it .",
    "the new model shows a deep alteration in the critical behavior at @xmath123 ( see the filled diamond symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) and the continuum limit of such a model is not given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rd]-[eq : logistic ] ) ( see also fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) because particles of type @xmath37 and type @xmath39 do not undergo the same diffusive process .",
    "one can expect that in this case the effective growth rate is reduced due to less frequent encounters between individuals of different types ",
    "particles close to the boundaries have less chances to turn into @xmath39 particles , and extinction times result to be smaller with respect of the original particle model .",
    "this highlights once more that the relation between individual - based and continuous reaction - diffusion models is a delicate one , which needs to be carefully taken into account when modeling the evolution of biological populations ."
