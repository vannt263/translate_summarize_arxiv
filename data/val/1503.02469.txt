    "the recent progress in ultracold atomic physics provides exceptional possibilities for studying low - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the confining geometry of atomic traps can drastically alter their ultracold scattering behaviour near the so - called confinement induced resonances ( cirs ) @xcite . employing magnetic feshbach resonances @xcite",
    ", one can control the interaction between the atoms and provide the conditions to experimentally observe the cirs for identical bosons @xcite and fermions@xcite , as well as distinguishable atoms @xcite .",
    "cirs have been extensively studied , e.g. in the context of bosonic s- @xcite and d - wave @xcite and dipolar @xcite scattering , fermionic p - wave scattering @xcite , distinguishable atom scattering @xcite in single - channel as well as in multichannel ( transversal excitation ) regimes @xcite . beyond this",
    "coupled l - wave cirs in cylindrically symmetric waveguides have been explored @xcite .    in spite of the impressive progress concerning the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations of cirs the existing theoretical models need to be improved for a quantitative interpretation and guiding of the experiments . in the seminal work of olshanii @xcite and in subsequent works",
    "@xcite , the simple form of a pseudo - potential was used to model the interatomic interactions as compared to cir investigations with more realistic interatomic potentials @xcite .",
    "however , all these approaches are of single - channel ( internal ) character , allowing one to explore only the main attribute of the feshbach resonances in the 3d free space , i.e. the appearance of a singularity in the s - wave scattering length @xmath1 when a molecular bound state with energy @xmath2 crosses the atom - atom scattering threshold at energy @xmath3 in the entrance channel . however , other important parameters of the feshbach resonance , such as the rotational and spin structure of the molecular bound state in the closed channel as well as the width @xmath4 of the resonance characterizing the coupling @xmath5 of the molecular state with the entrance channel , were ignored . in our recent work @xcite the single - channel scalar interatomic interaction",
    "was replaced by the four - channel tensorial potential modeling resonances of broad , narrow , and overlapping character for bosons , according to the two - channel parametrization suggested in @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to calculate the shifts and widths of s- , d- , and g - wave magnetic feshbach resonances of cs atoms emerging in harmonic waveguides as cirs .    in the present work our particular focus",
    "are p - wave collisions of identical fermions due to their anisotropic character .",
    "confinement induced shifts and widths of the resonances in an atomic waveguide could be envisaged , similar to what has been studied for s - wave interactions @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is therefore to extend our model @xcite to the fermionic case .",
    "we then calculate the shifts and widths of the feshbach resonance for @xmath0k atoms in its hyperfine state @xmath6 for experimental conditions @xcite . the parameters which can be obtained from the experiments on magnetic feshbach resonances in free space @xcite , namely , the spin characteristics , the background scattering volume @xmath7 , the resonant energies @xmath8 ( or the corresponding resonant value of the strength @xmath9 of the external magnetic field ) , and the width of the resonance @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are used as input parameters of our model .",
    "let us first discuss an extension of our model @xcite , developed for resonant s - wave scattering , to the case of p - wave feshbach resonances in 3d free space which can be observed in a single - component fermi gas .",
    "due to the pauli exclusion principle the two - body wave function must be antisymmetric , and therefore only odd partial waves @xmath10 contribute to the fermionic scattering process in case of a symmetric spin configuration .",
    "in contrast to the s - wave feshbach resonance , the atoms near a p - wave feshbach resonance have to tunnel through a centrifugal barrier to couple to the bound molecular state .",
    "therefore , the wave function of the continuum can be significantly influenced by the bound state in the closed channel only in a narrow range of the magnetic field .",
    "another feature of the p - wave feshbach resonances is a doublet structure which arises from the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between the electronic spins of the atoms .",
    "this splits the feshbach resonance into distinct resonances indicated by their partial - wave projection @xmath11 and @xmath12 along the quantization axis .    in this work",
    "we investigate collisions of two spin - polarized @xmath0k atoms in the hyperfine state @xmath13 .",
    "one can write the joint state of the atom pair as @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction between the valence electrons of the atom pairs can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fine structure constant , @xmath18 is the spin of the valence electron of @xmath19th atom , @xmath20 is the interatomic separation , and @xmath21 is the unit vector defining the direction of interatomic axis .",
    "it couples different partial wave components @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite , and breaks the rotational invariance .",
    "the different components @xmath26 contribute differently in the dipole - dipole interaction , which means that molecular bound states with different @xmath26 possess different energies @xcite .",
    "consequently , the feshbach resonances for different @xmath26 values couple to distinct molecular bound states and thus have different magnetic - field dependence .",
    "the difference in the pair collisions with the different @xmath26 projections can be understood intuitively by considering the dipole - dipole interaction between the two atoms .",
    "the external magnetic field orients the spin of the valence electron of @xmath0k in @xmath13 state .",
    "when two dipoles are aligned side - by - side ( head - to - tail ) , they are in a repulsive ( attractive ) configuration , corresponding to @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the difference between the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 is illustrated in fig.3 of ref.@xcite . in the case",
    "the motion is in a plane containing the magnetic field the interaction alternates between attractive and repulsive as the dipoles change between head to tail attraction and side by side repulsion . on the other hand , for the case that the atoms move in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the magnetic field the dipoles are held in the side - by - side configuration , and the interaction is only repulsive . due to this effect one",
    "expects that the dipole - dipole interaction lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisional channels which leads to a splitting of the feshbach resonances , with corresponding resonance for @xmath12 at a higher energy @xcite .",
    "this doublet structure disappears with increasing temperature due to a broadening of the resonance .    for p - wave collisions the relevant parameter is the scattering volume , @xmath29 which has been parameterized as @xcite    @xmath30    near the magnetic feshbach resonance , where @xmath29 and the effective range @xmath31 were approximated as a quadratic function of the magnetic field b @xmath32",

    "as the trap frequency @xmath185 increases we observe deviations between the analytical and numerical results for @xmath173 .    the same way as in the case of the free space resonance , the width @xmath245 of the cir narrows with decreasing energy @xmath178 ( see fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig8 ] shows that in a harmonic waveguide there is a region where we have a possibility for narrowing the width by decreasing the trap frequency .",
    "we develop and analyze a theoretical model to study feshbach resonances of identical fermions in atomic waveguides by extending the two - channel model suggested in @xcite and adopted in @xcite for confined bosons . in this model ,",
    "the experimentally known parameters of feshbach resonances in free space are used as an input . within this approach",
    "we have calculated the shifts and widths of p - wave magnetic feshbach resonance of @xmath0k atoms in the hyperfine state @xmath6 and for the relative angular momentum state @xmath175 emerging in harmonic waveguides as p - wave cirs .",
    "we find a linear dependence of the resonance position on the longitudinal colliding energy below the threshold for the first transverse excitation .",
    "it is shown that in a harmonic waveguide there is the possibility to decrease the width of the p - wave feshbach resonance by decreasing the ( transversal ) trap frequency which could be used in corresponding experiments .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the importance of including the effective range terms in the computational schemes for the description of the p - wave cirs contrary to the case of s - wave cirs where the impact of the effective radius is negligible . in previous investigations of the p - wave cirs in harmonic waveguides",
    "@xcite the effects due to the effective range have been neglected .",
    "the developed model can be applied for a quantitative analysis of other p - wave cirs following a different spin structure and for confining traps of different geometry including effects due to anharmonicity and anisotropy .",
