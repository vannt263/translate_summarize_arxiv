    "answers to this question may sound rhetorical , nonetheless examples can be found in astronomy history that show that whenever new instruments are pointed to the sky unexpected discoveries are possible .",
    "so the discovery of some astrophysical neutrino source not seen with other messengers such as photons or protons is possible .",
    "in fact photons or nucleons may not be able to escape outside their sources or they may interact with the radio , infra - red and microwave ( cmb ) backgrounds during their propagation to us .",
    "neutrinos are good messengers due to their weakly interacting properties and due to the fact that , being neutral , they allow us to point back to their sources .",
    "hence they let us access tens of gpc regions of the sky , while photons with e @xmath0 tev and protons ( e @xmath1 ev ) observations are limited to @xmath2 mpc depending on their energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the weakly interacting properties of neutrinos make their detection more challenging and in fact neutrino telescopes ( nts ) have been operating now about a decade with no positive observation yet .",
    "given the above caveats , i will show here at what level we may expect a positive observation given expectations derived from photon observations .",
    "it is commonly believed that about 10% of the energy emitted in galactic sn explosions at an approximate rate of 3 per century can provide the power needed to account for the observed cosmic rays up to the knee region .",
    "the knee seems to be z dependent , so that the composition becomes heavy above @xmath3 pev .",
    "since the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum extends to regions well above @xmath4 ev it is not possible that these ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are of galactic origin but we have at today no firm explanation on what are the sources of the extra - galactic component nor we have determined their composition .",
    "most of the experiments indicate it is lighter than in the region right above the knee and there is common agreement between hires and pierre auger observatory ( pao ) on the observation of the gzk cut - off due to interactions of protons with the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "pao used 27 highest energy events ( e@xmath5 eev ) and found that 20 are at less than @xmath6 from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in their catalogue at a distance @xmath7 mpc while 5.6 are expected on average . nonetheless , this is not a conclusive observation that agn are the sources of cosmic rays .",
    "the isotropic distribution of events is incompatible at 1% level @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", hires does not confirm the result @xcite .",
    "upper limits on diffuse @xmath8 fluxes exist from nts covering the range from about 10 tev to some pev for muon neutrinos as well as for neutrino induced cascades of all flavors .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the experimental results for muon neutrinos as well as the unfolded atmospheric neutrino spectrum measured by amanda - ii .",
    "neutrinos could offer a source of further information about the uhecrs in the region of the gzk cut - off . protons with energies @xmath1",
    "ev interact with the cmb and infrared backgrounds producing pions that decay into neutrinos , known as cosmogenic neutrinos . on the other hand ,",
    "if the uhe cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) consist of heavy or intermediate mass nuclei rather than protons , they would generate neutrinos through photodisintegration followed by pion production through nucleon - photon scattering and resulting fluxes would be lower than in the pure proton assumption .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos are often considered as a guaranteed uhe flux but predicted fluxes vary over orders of magnitudes due to the degree of freedom in defining the transition region between the galactic fading component and the onset of the extragalactic one .",
    "they depend on uhecr composition and spectra but these measurements are affected by large systematics @xcite .",
    "neutrino detection above @xmath4 ev may be challenging for existing detectors and new techniques may be needed to firmly establish their existence and to extract useful astrophysical information on source injection spectra , maximum energy for acceleration in these sources , source evolution and composition .",
    "a well known bound to the extra - galactic diffuse flux of neutrinos was proposed in @xcite .",
    "neutrino fluxes above this bound can be obtained not only assuming optically thick sources @xcite , but also optically thin ones and normalizing the extra - galactic uhecr component at @xmath9 ev to the measured spectra by hires or agasa @xcite , rather than assuming an @xmath8 proton spectrum normalized at @xmath10 ev . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the upper limits and sensitivities to an @xmath8 flux of muon neutrinos for nts and compare it to the w&b bound for optically thin sources @xcite and manneheim , protheroe and rachen one for completely opaque sources @xcite , as well the all flavor  low cross - over \" scenario flux in @xcite . the w&b flux , after accounting for oscillations , corresponds to about 50 muon neutrino events in the full icecube per year . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the experimental bounds on cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for various experiments .",

    "nts use a 3d array of photomultipliers ( pmts ) to detect the cherenkov light produced by charged particles with velocity in the radiator ( ice or water ) larger than that of light .",
    "the spacing between strings holding sensors is determined by the properties of the radiator , by costs and by the energy region of interest .",
    "experiments that focus on extending observations well above 10 pev require cubic - kilometer dimensions and hence cost is the limiting factor that determines the spacing of optical modules ( oms ) , pressure resistant glass spheres that house pmts .",
    "the photocathode area density determines the reconstruction performance of these detectors that is energy dependent .",
    "most of the information that qualify detectors is contained in the effective area for neutrinos ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , a parameter that for muon neutrinos is given by the probability of the charge current interaction in the target medium , the selection efficiency and the muon range .",
    "this parameter convoluted to a neutrino flux will return the observed rate of events from that flux .",
    "since the neutrino cross section is small ( @xmath16 @xmath17 at @xmath18 tev , increasing almost linearly with energy ) , the equivalent size of these detectors translates into very small areas compared to their geometrical size .",
    "because this area is strongly dependent on energy and spans several decades in energy , different neutrino fluxes will produce differential distributions of events vs energy ( response curves ) that depend on the flux slope . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the response curves for antares , amanda - ii and ic22 for the atmospheric neutrino spectrum @xcite and for a harder spectrum @xmath8 close to what is expected from @xmath19 order fermi acceleration mechanisms . for ic22 90% of the upgoing muons",
    "are in the range 3 tev-3 pev for @xmath8 and between 250 gev - 16 tev for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "since the peak of the response curve moves to higher energies the harder the spectrum , correspondingly the area of interest is higher for most of the signal events compared to atmospheric neutrinos , indicating that this technique is optimized for high energies due to the rise of cross sections and of the muon range with neutrino energy .",
    "nonetheless , atmospheric neutrino events dominate since incident fluxes in the detector have much higher normalization .",
    "the antares detector is slightly more sensitive to lower energies for atmospheric neutrinos than amanda - ii due to the fact that in antares there are 3 close - by optical modules at each storey vertically separated along a string by 14.5 m while in amanda there is only one with a vertical separation of about 10 m. string separation is smaller in amanda by on average about 15 - 20 m but though in ice the absorption length is larger than in sea water , the scattering length is much smaller .     effective area vs neutrino energy for the lower hemisphere for antares , amanda - ii , ic22 and ic80 . for amanda - ii and ic22",
    "these areas correspond to optimized point - like source data analyses .",
    "ic80 area is obtained with the same cuts studied for ic22 and antares one is obtained for point source analysis cuts studied by simulation .",

    "spectrum ( same selections than in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the smaller spacing and larger photocathode area density of antares and amanda makes their detection threshold lower than for ic22 .",
    "icecube is capable of measuring events of much higher energy than amanda or antares and will have better performance at low energies than what shown here with the addition of deepcore . ]",
    "amanda - ii , icecube precursor , at a depth between about 1.5 to 2 km , is made of 19 strings at an average distance of 50 m forming a cylinder of 200 m and holding 677 oms containing 20 cm - diameter pmts .",
    "the newer generation detector , icecube , also located at the south pole , uses the digital technology to digitize the signals from the 25 cm in diameter pmts with 300 mhz custom chips and 40 mhz flash adcs .",
    "the icecube observatory is composed of a deep detector made of instrumented strings between about 1.5 and 2.5 km and a surface array called icetop .",
    "icecube strings are 1 km long , hence icecube profits compared to amanda of the higher transparency of deep ice and of the larger horizontal acceptance relevant for neutrinos of energies @xmath21 pev since earth shadowing effects become more severe for vertical directions compared to horizontal ones .",
    "each string holds 60 digital oms ( doms ) separated vertically by about 17 m. strings are about 125 m apart .",
    "the configuration taking now data is comprised of 40 strings ( ic40 ) and 40 icetop stations corresponding to each string of two frozen water tanks .",
    "each tank contains 2 doms that can measure the light emitted by the electromagnetic component of atmospheric showers and the combination of the 2 detectors can measure also the muons that penetrate deep in the ice .",
    "icecube construction will be concluded when 80 strings will be installed at a rate of about 16 per season up to the 2010 - 11 season .",
    "additional 6 strings , called deepcore , are planned to be installed with 50 out of 60 of high quantum efficiency sensors deployed with vertical spacing of 7 m in the clear ice below 2100 m. the region of dense string spacing will consist of a total of 13 strings covering an area of roughly 250 m in diameter .",
    "the aim of this densely instrumented array is to lower the threshold of icecube for enhancing sensitivity in the region below 1 tev , interesting for dark matter studies , neutrino oscillations or galactic sources with steep spectra or cut - off at about a few tev . for these studies",
    "deepcore will increase icecube effective area by about an order of magnitude at 100 gev.the large instrumented volume of icecube around deepcore will offer a muon veto that will allow to single out starting muons in the detector due to low energy neutrino interactions in the fiducial volume .",
    "another extension under consideration is to enhance the effective area of icecube for energies @xmath22 tev .",
    "a modified arrangement of the outer 12 strings can lead to an increase in effective area between 15 - 40% for well reconstructed tracks depending on their distance from the rest of the array .",
    "this could be advantageous for the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos ( see fig .",

    "lines are separated by 60 - 75 m from each other and each of the lines holds 25 floors called storeys .",
    "each storey has 3 10-inch pmts looking downward at @xmath23 from the vertical housed inside pressure resistant glass spheres made of two halves closed by applying an under - pressure of 200 - 300 mbar .",
    "storeys also include titanium containers housing the frontend electronics with a pair of asic chips per pmt used for signal processing and digitization that provide the time stamp and amplitude of the pmt signal .",
    "each of the oms contains a pulsed led for calibration of the relative variations of pmt transit time and a system of led and laser optical beacons allows the relative time calibration of different oms .",
    "an internal clock system distributes from shore the 20 mhz clock signal , that is synchronized by gps to the universal time with a precision of @xmath24 ns .",
    "time calibrations allow a precision at the level of 0.5 ns and a positioning system that includes tiltmeters and compasses giving the orientation of storeys and an acoustic triangulation system of hydrophones and transceivers provide the relative sensor position and the line shape reconstruction .      the current status of various observations for point source searches is shown in fig .

    "ic22 data sample is composed of 5114 upgoing muon events and we expect 4642 atmospheric neutrinos using the bartol flux calculation @xcite in 275.7 d. the agreement between data and mc is well inside the systematic uncertainty of atmospheric neutrino calculations of about 15% @xcite given the estimated contamination of misreconstructed atmospheric muons of about 10% larger in the horizontal region .",
