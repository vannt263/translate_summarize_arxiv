    "various features of pulsars have been disclosed with growing observational data .",
    "most pulsars have stable pulse shapes , and spin down steadily with typical time - scales of order several myr ( see e.g. mszros @xcite ) .",
    "however , deviations from the linear spin - down trends have also been observed on shorter time - scales in some pulsars .",
    "these deviations convey information about the surroundings , internal structure and dynamics of neutron stars .",
    "for example , the presence of glitches ( see e.g.  shemar & lyne @xcite ; wang et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicates the internal structure that two or more poorly coupled components coexist in the stars , while timing noise ( see e.g.  dalessandro @xcite ) is believed to be due to random movements of the fluid in pulsars . besides these short time - scale instabilities",
    ", the spin - down features indicating the precession due to stellar deformation have also been reported .",
    "two anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , 1e1048.15937 and 1e2259 + 586 , were observed to indicate irregular spin - down ( see e.g.  mereghetti @xcite ; baykal & swank @xcite ; baykal et al .",
    "@xcite ; oosterbroek et al .",
    "axps are a subclass of x - ray pulsars with period in a very narrow range ( 612s ) and period derivatives in a range ( @xmath0ss@xmath1 ) ( see e.g.  mereghetti & stella @xcite ) , and those are most likely candidates of magnetars ( duncan & thompson @xcite ; thompson & duncan @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) along with soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) ( see e.g.  kouveliotou et al .",
    "@xcite ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "as discussed by melatos ( @xcite ) , the wobbles in their spin - down rates may be interpreted by an effect called radiative precession ( melatos @xcite ) , which is related with an oscillating component of electromagnetic torque .",
    "another precessing pulsar psr b182811 ( stairs et al .",
    "@xcite ) was reported very recently .",
    "this gives the very clear observation of free precession of an isolated neutron star .",
    "these deformed , precessing objects are analyzed by solving the euler equation of motion in the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inertia tensor , @xmath4 is the angular velocity and @xmath5 is the torque acting on the object .",
    "when we take into account the electromagnetic torque by a rotating magnetic dipole ( davis & goldstein @xcite ; goldreich @xcite ) , the above - mentioned radiative precession can be found for magnetically deformed stars ( melatos @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , since magnetically deformed , rotating stars emit gravitational waves , we can consider the gravitational radiation reaction torque ( bertotti & anile @xcite ; cutler & jones @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational backreaction damps the wobbles on a time - scale proportional to @xmath6^{-1}$ ] for wobbling , axisymmetric rigid bodies , where @xmath7 is the principal moments of inertia .",
    "thus , the moments of inertia play a significant role in the analyses of pulsar precession .",
    "the estimates of the moments of inertia have been done in the context of newtonian gravity so far",
    ". however , neutron stars are fully general relativistic objects , and it is important to take into account general relativistic effects .",
    "therefore , we now discuss the principal moments of inertia of magnetically deformed stars in the context of general relativity .    in newtonian gravity ,",
    "once we have the the mass distribution of an object @xmath8 , the moment of inertia with respect to any axis can be calculated from @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the length from the axis . in general relativity , only for axisymmetric objects , the moment of inertia with respect to the symmetric axis can be well defined . for this definition ,",
    "we need slow rotation of the objects .",
    "the slow rotation ensures that the angular momentum @xmath11 is linearly related to the angular velocity @xmath12 , i.e.  @xmath13 .",
    "here , @xmath14 defines the general relativistic version of the moment of inertia .",
    "the moments of inertia of relativistic , spherically symmetric stars were discussed by hartle ( @xcite ) and chandrasekhar & millar ( @xcite ) . the approximate expression valid for various realistic equations of state",
    "was also derived by ravenhall & pethick ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , we discuss the principal moments of inertia of magnetically deformed stars which are axisymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis .",
    "deformation of relativistic magnetized stars was studied both in the numerical approach ( bonazzola et al .",

    "@xcite ) , stellar magnetic fields were regarded as corrections to non - rotating , spherical stars , and the magnetic deformation of stars was formulated using a perturbative approach .",
    "as mentioned above , we now take into account the slow rotation of the deformed stars on the symmetric axis to define the moment of inertia .",
    "the formulation of this configuration is given in ",

    "( @xcite ) , magnetic fields can be treated as corrections to a background , spherically symmetric star , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "we now assume that the star slowly rotates on the magnetic axis with a uniform angular velocity @xmath17 , which is also regarded as a perturbation . in this paper , we take into account the rotational corrections up to first order in @xmath18 .",

    "this is also because the moment of inertia can be modified significantly by the mass shift rather than the magnetic deformation . in our formulation , this condition is accomplished by imposing the boundary condition that @xmath26 vanishes at infinity .",

    "@xcite ) . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figiz ] , our numerical result for @xmath90 is different from this simple estimate .",
    "this is because the perturbed star does not have constant effective density by the added perturbation , even though we assume the background star with constant density .",

    "it follows that the effective density is not a constant .",

    "concentrating on the general relativistic effects on the magnetic correction @xmath86 , we can find from fig .",
    "[ figiz ] that the values of @xmath86 for each stellar model become large with the general relativistic factor @xmath88 .",
    "the increments are 50% at most .",

    "= 8.8 cm    next , we discuss the other principal moments of inertia , i.e.  @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in the context of general relativity ,",
    "the definition of these quantities is associated with a difficulty in the concept . as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ afw1 ] ) and ( [ m - inertia ] ) , the notion of moments of inertia is related with quantities at infinity ( see also geroch @xcite ; hansen @xcite ) . if we consider the rotation of the star on the @xmath96-axis or the @xmath97-axis , it produces the radiation of electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "thus , the exterior space - time is not stationary , but radiative .",
    "there is no rigorous way to define the moments of inertia in such a radiative space - time .",
    "the concept of @xmath94 and @xmath95 itself may be meaningless to a considerable extent .",
    "therefore , only approximate expressions are available .",
    "it would be useful to extend newtonian expressions , since it seems that most of newtonian features still survive for neutron stars specified by the general relativistic factor @xmath98 .",
    "we can not prove the validity mathematically , but will test some empirical relations . for this purpose ,",
    "let us recall relations using the principal moments of inertia and the ellipticity which hold for an incompressible fluid in the context of newtonian gravity .",
    "these are helpful in seeking the other principal moments of inertia .",
    "first , if the fluid body is subject to quadrupole deformation , then the relation between the principal moments of inertia exists @xmath99 using this relation , the difference between the principal moments of inertia @xmath86 and @xmath94 is given by @xmath100 in the different way , this difference can be expressed also by using the ellipticity , which is defined by the difference between the equatorial radius and the polar radius ( see e.g. chandrasekhar & miller @xcite ; konno et al .",
    "@xcite ; konno et al.@xcite ) , @xmath101 thus , the difference is derived by the two methods .",
    "there is no reason that the two expressions coincide , but empirically the agreement is good . note that these expressions ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ i2 ] ) coincide exactly in this case .",
    "if we assume that the relation ( [ q - rel ] ) is applicable to general relativistic cases , it seems that we should simply apply the relation ( [ q - rel ] ) to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figiz ] and derive @xmath94 and @xmath95 . however , in order to utilize this relation , the magnetic corrections must be purely quadrupole contributions . as seen from the metric ( [ metric ] )",
    ", the magnetic deformation includes monopole parts as well as quadrupole parts .",
    "thus , our results in fig .  [ figiz ] also include monopole parts .",
    "hence , we have to subtract monopole contributions from @xmath87 to derive @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is , nevertheless , not so easy to extract monopole contributions accurately from these magnetically deformed stars .    however , there is no guarantee that all the results in fig .",
    "[ figiz ] include monopole contributions dominantly .",
    "if there is the case in which the monopole part can be neglected , then we can estimate @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the case , by assuming that the relation ( [ q - rel ] ) holds approximately .",
    "that case would also provide some extrapolation for general relativistic effects on @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the other cases . in order to seek such a case",
    ", we now compare @xmath102 derived by simply using the results in fig .",
    "[ figiz ] with @xmath103 calculated from the ellipticity , which was already estimated for several stellar models ( konno et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case that @xmath102 is almost consistent with @xmath103 about the values and tendency , it seems that the monopole part can be neglected , and we may use the relation ( [ q - rel ] ) . from the comparison , we find that @xmath102 is almost consistent with @xmath103 in the case of @xmath104 .",
    "figure [ figid ] displays the comparison between @xmath102 and @xmath103 in this stellar model .",
    "the two curves coincide within 10% .",
    "hence , we can estimate @xmath94 and @xmath95 using eq .",
    "( [ q - rel ] ) in this stellar model . since",
    "the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are simply given by multiplying @xmath86 by a factor of @xmath105 , the changes of the absolute values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 due to general relativistic effects are specified by the same factor as in the case of @xmath86 ( see fig .  [ figix ] ) .",
    "consequently , we derive very similar result to that of @xmath86 .",
    "however , @xmath94 and @xmath95 decrease with the general relativistic factor @xmath88 , while @xmath86 increases .",
    "we expect that similar features exist also in the other stellar models .",
    "recent observations indicate precession of some pulsars . in order to understand the dynamics of these pulsars in detail",
    ", we have to know the moments of inertia , which play a crucial role in the euler equation of motion .",
    "motivated by this consideration , we have discussed the general relativistic effect on the moments of inertia of magnetically deformed stars . by developing the formulation by konno et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we have considered the slow rotation of magnetically deformed stars on the symmetric axis in order to define the moment of inertia . the general expression for the magnetic correction @xmath86 to the moments of inertia of spherically symmetric stars was obtained , and the numerical estimates for various polytropic stellar models were also obtained .",
    "the other components of the moments of inertia @xmath94 and @xmath95 were discussed from the extension of relations in newtonian gravity . from those results , we found that each principal moment of inertia is modified by a factor of 2 at most due to the general relativistic effect .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the general relativistic effect does not affect precessing motion noticeably in the case of free precession of pulsars .",
    "however , it is not clear whether or not the electromagnetic radiation reaction torque acting on the pulsars change due to the general relativistic effect .",
    "if this torque is modified by the general relativistic effect , then the period of the wobbles would also be modified .",
    "therefore , this point should be made clear in future investigation .",
