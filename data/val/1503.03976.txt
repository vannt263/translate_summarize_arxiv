    "scale - invariant random spatial networks ( sirsns ) are a class of random networks defined as a route between each pair of points , with three types of properties .",
    "first , invariance properties , second , guarantees on mean lengths of routes  in the euclidean metric  and third guarantees on the mean length of intersection of a suitably truncated version of the network with a given compact set .",
    "it turns out that these conditions are enough to deeply constrain the network .",
    "for example , all sirsns have singly - infinite paths for which any subset is included in a route , but no such paths are doubly - infinite .",
    "the only known example is the binary hierarchy model , in two dimensions .",
    "it consists of minimum - time paths on a dyadic grid where speed depends on the two - valuation .",
    "invariance is obtained by a randomization construction .",
    "the latter feature is somewhat unsatisfying : the model itself is invariant , but realisations exhibit long - range dependence : observation of a small region gives much information on the network everywhere .",
    "a more `` natural '' candidate for a sirsn is therefore the _ poisson line process model_. intuitively , lines are thrown uniformly at random in @xmath0 , and marked with random speed limits .",
    "slower lines are dense in @xmath0 .",
    "then the route between two points is the minimum - time path made of segments of these lines . remarkably , even in dimension @xmath1 , when random lines almost surely do not intersect , such paths exist .",
    "the whole construction is invariant .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the poisson line process is indeed a sirsn for all @xmath2 .",
    "historically , @xcite introduced the notion of a sirsn , and proved a number of their properties , including those mentioned in the first paragraphs of this . @xcite",
    "give a verbal description .",
    "the motivation was twofold .",
    "first , @xcite had proved that it was possible to build a road network connecting a prescribed set of points that both had routes almost as short as the segments between each pair of points , that is , the corresponding euclidean geodesics , and total road length almost as short as the steiner tree , that is , the shortest possible connecting network .",
    "however , the network was less efficient at small scales .",
    "thanks to their invariance properties , sirsns have the same efficiency at all scales .",
    "it turns out that there is a trade - off : for a sirsn , there is a lower bound on the expected total length of the network , which is decreasing in the expected route length between two points .",
    "the second motivation was to give a mathematical abstraction of road networks and maps , in particular online maps as they are used today .",
    "namely , we may change viewpoint , zoom in or out , and the appearance changes little , as smaller roads are shown and hidden .",
    "sirsns are then defined as statistically invariant under translation , rotation and change of scale .",
    "moreover , we are less interested in the roads than in the routes : how do we drive from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ? sirsns are thus defined by giving routes only , namely unique routes connecting pairs of points .",
    "it turns out that a notion of `` main roads '' at any scale can be built from the network of routes itself . to wit",
    ", the network of main roads at scale @xmath5 would be the network of routes deprived of balls of radius @xmath5 around their endpoints .",
    "it is finite in every compact .",
    "similarly , @xcite have shown that a number of statistics of real road networks do not depend on scale .",
    "@xciteproved that the binary hierarchy model was a sirsn , and suggested two other possible models for sirsn , one of which is the poisson line process model .",
    "@xcite has then proved important properties of the poisson line process with appropriate speeds : it does yield a random metric space and this space is a geodesic space . moreover , in dimension two , the geodesics are almost everywhere unique , the geodesics are locally of finite mean - length , and the subnetwork obtained from the routes connecting points of an independent poisson point process has finite length in a compact set .",
    "the latter properties establish a `` pre - sirsn '' result , but fall short of the full definition .    as a candidate for",
    "a sirsn , poisson line process model then fall in a large category : networks derived from geodesic spaces .",
    "indeed , from any geodesic space , we may build a spatial network by associating to any two points the geodesic(s ) connecting them .",
    "it is not obvious how one might determine when such a network is a sirsn .    in section  [ notations ] , we give a precise definition of a sirsn and of poisson line processes .",
    "we also present other notation and definitions , and recall some known results , in particular that the poisson line process with speed limits yields a random metric on @xmath0 .",
    "we then give a few basic properties of @xmath6-paths , that is paths in this metric space . in section  [ time_diam ] ,",
    "we give sharp bounds on the random diameter for this metric of a euclidean ball , with a few generalizations .",
    "these estimates will be an important tool in several subsequent proofs . in section",
    "[ unique ] , we prove that geodesics between a given pair of points are almost surely unique , in any dimension",
    ". lemma  [ tour ] will play a central role : we introduce the notion of `` many directions '' , and the lemma states that geodesics have many directions at relevant points .",
    "a consequence is that any path using the same lines as a geodesic will contain these points .",
    "we will then conclude by noticing that geodesics between the same pair of points almost surely use the same lines ( lemma  [ sameseg ] ) .",
    "in section  [ expect_geo ] , we prove that geodesics have finite mean euclidean length .",
    "alternatively , we may see the result as supplying a stochastic control of the euclidean diameter of balls for the metric generated by the poisson line process .",
    "section  [ ldn ] contains the last and most important component of the proof that the poisson line process generates a sirsn .",
    "intuitively , we establish a sharp control of the total length of the intersection of all infinitely many geodesics minus a ball around each endpoint , with a given ball .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that all these geodesics coalesce before hitting the ball and split after leaving it .",
    "bounds are given using the pigeon - hole principle and the fact that relevant geodesics must use the few fast lines that hit the ball .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] suggests a few potential directions of future inquiry .",
    "we follow @xcite s ( @xcite ) notation whenever possible .    we write @xmath7 for the ball with center @xmath8 and radius @xmath5 .",
    "we first give the precise definition of a sirsn .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 is an atom - free measure on a measurable space @xmath10 .",
    "recall that a poisson point process of intensity measure @xmath11 is a random set of points such that for any @xmath12 , the number of points @xmath13 in @xmath4 is a poisson variable with intensity @xmath14 , and the number of points @xmath15 in disjoint @xmath16 are independent . then a sirsn is defined as follows .",
    "[ defsirsn ] a sirsn is a process that associates to any two points @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath0 random routes such that :    between two specified points @xmath17 and @xmath18 , there is almost surely a unique route @xmath19 .",
    "it is a finite - length path connecting @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    for a finite number of points @xmath20 in @xmath0 , consider the subnetwork @xmath21 formed by the random routes connecting all @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24 is statistically invariant under translation , rotation and change of scale : if @xmath25 is a euclidean similarity of @xmath0 , then @xmath26 has the same distribution as @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the length of a route between two points at unit distance .",
    "then @xmath29 < \\infty$ ] .",
    "let @xmath30 be a collection of poisson processes on @xmath0 with intensity @xmath31 times lebesgue , all independent from the sirsn .",
    "suppose they are coupled so that @xmath32 .",
    ". then the _ intensity _ ( mean length per unit area ) @xmath34 of the following long - distance network is finite : @xmath35",
    "note that @xcite uses more conditions in his definition , but the missing properties are implied by property  4 .",
    "they were useful to define weaker variants of a sirsn .",
    "the use of poisson processes in property  4 makes it look slightly complex , but this is a technical shortcut : it allows us to study the network through only countably many routes .",
    "morally , we would like property  4 to hold true if the long - distance network was defined as the union of all routes between all pairs of points of @xmath0 , minus the balls around the endpoints .",
    "but there would be uncountably many routes , and it would be harder to work with .",
    "we now turn to the definition of the improper poisson line process .",
    "we first need a measure on lines .",
    "more details on this kind of process may be found in the book by @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be the space of all lines of @xmath0 .",

    ". thus @xmath50 ) = \\frac{\\omega_{d-1}}{2 } r^{d-1}$ ] .",
    "consider the following parameterization of a line @xmath51 : it is given by a direction and a localization .",
    "the direction is an element of the projective space @xmath52 .",
    "it then defines a hyperplane normal to this direction , through a special point  the origin  of @xmath0 .",
    "the localization is a point on this hyperplane .",
    "the line @xmath51 is then the line through this point normal to this hyperplane .",
    "hence , writing @xmath53 for an hyperplane of @xmath0 , we may parameterize the set of lines by @xmath54 .",
    "notice that if we want to keep track of the topology of the set of lines , the product should be twisted , but we only need measure - theoretical properties , so we stick to the simpler direct product .",
    "recall that the projective space @xmath52 may be seen as the sphere @xmath49 with opposite ",
    "points identified .",
    "the projective space then inherits the natural metric on the sphere , namely the distance between two pairs of antipodal points is the angle between the pair of segments joining them , in radians .",

    "we call it the _ solid angle _ of @xmath3 from @xmath8 . notice that it is not quite the usual definition since pairs of antipodal points contribute only once , and since we have normalized to a probability measure .",
    "this is because we are concerned with orientations of undirected lines , rather than angles of directed lines .    a special case we shall need is the measure of a cone , that is , all the lines with angle less than @xmath63 from a given line through the origin .",
    "this measure is proportional to the area on the hemisphere hit by the lines , hence proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "the integral up to @xmath65 has value  @xmath66 , so that @xmath67    the uniform poisson line process is the image of the poisson point process on  @xmath36 with intensity measure @xmath43 .",

    "namely , the improper poisson line process is the image of a poisson point process on @xmath68 with intensity measure @xmath69 , given by the density @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite does define this process for all @xmath72 , but the relevant case for sirsns is that of @xmath71 .    in words , we have more and more slower lines , following a power law . since @xmath73 diverges at zero ,",

    ", the geodesic must have fast segments for length at least @xmath620 between @xmath594 and @xmath493 ( resp . , @xmath80 and @xmath222 ) , that is , @xmath621 m_1 ( \\mathcal{v } _",

    "@xmath626 and @xmath270 coincide on @xmath637 .",
    "in particular , they coincide on @xmath597 .",
    "hence , the intersection @xmath638 is included in the finite number of geodesics @xmath639 .",
    "we may then conclude by separating contributions from fast and slow lines : @xmath640    [ issirsn ] the network @xmath115 made of the time geodesics is a sirsn .",
    "property  1 of a sirsn is a consequence of almost sure uniqueness of geodesics between two points , that is theorem  [ unique ] in dimension at least @xmath641 , and theorem 4.4 . in @xcite s ( @xcite ) article in dimension @xmath271 .",
    "property  2 of a sirsn is because the underlying poisson line process is invariant by translation and rotation . as for change of scale ,",
    "the underlying poisson line process is invariant by a transformation where scale is multiplied by @xmath165 and speed by @xmath642 .",
    "hence , all paths have their time length multiplied by the same @xmath643 , so that the geodesics are the same and @xmath115 is invariant .",
    "property  3 of a sirsn is theorem  [ teo_len ] .",
    "property  4 of a sirsn is theorem  [ finite_intensity ] .",
    "we have established that the improper poisson line process with adequate speed limits yield a sirsn .    along the way , a few questions have been raised .",
    "is there an easier , more natural way to prove uniqueness of geodesics ?",
    "what are the tightest moments of the euclidean length of a geodesic ? when can we generalize this construction using geodesics from a random geodesic metric space ?    on a more general note , we may wonder which property of our network @xmath115 translate to general sirsns , or to sirsns made of geodesics of a metric space .",
    "for example , it should be easy to show that not all sirsns have the equivalent of lemma  [ tour ] or corollary  [ strengthening ] : it is certainly not true for the binary hierarchy model by aldous .",
    "we might also raise a few typical questions in stochastic geometry .",
    "is there only one geodesic connecting a prescribed point @xmath8 to infinity , like in dimension two ?",
    "in many models , infinite geodesics have an asymptotic direction . for sirsns ,",
    "this property looks unlikely , and characterizing the random walk of the angle as a function of the @xmath501-distance to @xmath8 looks worthwhile .",
    "what is the law of a typical cell in the tessellation generated by the network connecting the points of @xmath644 , an intensity @xmath66 poisson point process ?    finally ,",
    "another somewhat tangential direction of research would be to study more closely the properties of the random metric space .",
    "for example , being a sirsn entails coalescence of geodesics , a very hyperbolic - like property . we may also draw comparisons with a well - known random metric space such as the brownian map [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the brownian map is a random metric space homeomorphic to the sphere @xmath645 .",
    "it has hausdorff dimension @xmath646 .",
    "all its geodesics minus their endpoints is of hausdorff dimension @xmath66 .",
    "the cut - locus of its geodesics starting from a given point has hausdorff dimension @xmath271 , and the topology of an open continuous tree .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that our metric space is homeomorphic to  @xmath0 .",
    "it should be easy , by scaling arguments , to show that its hausdorff dimension is @xmath647 , which is bigger than @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , with @xmath648 and @xmath649 , we have the same dimensions as the brownian map .",
    "if any geodesic can be appropriately approximated by geodesics between points of poisson point processes , it should also be easy to show that the geodesics minus their endpoints is of dimension @xmath66 .",
    "however , the cut - locus might have a very different behaviour .",
    "i would like to thank wilfrid kendall for introducing us to the problem during a talk , and helpful discussions since then .",
    "remarks from a referee have greatly improved the presentation of the paper ."
