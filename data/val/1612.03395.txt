    "the control of electric transport by utilizing the spin angular momentum has been a central theme in spintronics after the discovery of the giant and tunnel magnetoresistances , leading to new functionalities for sensing , logic , and data storage applications @xcite . on the other hand , the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) in ferromagnets , i.e.",
    "the dependence of electric transport on the relative angle between the current and magnetization directions , has been already discovered in 1857 by lord kelvin @xcite . just like the anomalous hall effect ( ahe )",
    ", it is rooted in the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . in the absence of a general theory ,",
    "several studies addressed the amr in a simple model system , viz .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas with rashba and dresselhaus socs .",
    "the applied methods were the boltzmann equation @xcite and the linear - response kubo formalism @xcite .",
    "recently , a so - called spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) has been discovered in bilayers made from heavy normal metals such as platinum and ferromagnetic insulators ( fis ) such as @xmath1 ( yig ) @xcite .",
    "the smr can be explained by the simultaneous action of the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite and its inverse that is modulated by the spin transfer torque or relative angle of the current - induced spin polarization in the metal and the magnetization direction of the ferromagnet .",
    "hence , the smr  is a non - local and non - equilibrium magnetic proximity effect ( mpe ) .",
    "alternative mechanisms for the smr have been proposed , i.e. , the magnetized normal metal , typically pt , by the ferromagnet contact @xcite or the rashba soc at the interface @xcite , but theoretical and experimental support of those models is still scarce .",
    "smr - like phenomena have been observed for all metallic bilayers as well @xcite , but the interpretation of the results is easier when the magnet is an electric insulator since parallel current paths through the magnet can be excluded .",
    "the reported smr ratios are quite small ( of the order of @xmath2 ) , being proportional to the squared spin hall angle which is typically less than 10% @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional topological insulators ( 3d tis ) are ideally insulating in the bulk while supporting topologically protected metallic surface states as a consequence of time reversal symmetry and band inversion induced by a strong soc @xcite . in the surface of tis as well as the rashba - splitting 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) the helical band structure",
    "is realized , in which the spin and momentum are locked and hence the surface currents are spin - polarized @xcite .",
    "the interface between a ti ( or a rashba 2deg @xcite ) and a ferromagnet can be a spin source in which the soc enhances the magnitude of both charge and spin currents @xcite .",
    "electric transport properties of bilayers of 3d tis with ( metallic ) ferromagnets have indeed been interpreted in terms of much larger spin hall angles @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been some experiments with yig for the spin - charge conversion @xcite .",
    "tis are therefore a promising platform to enhance the smr .",
    "the smr interpretation in terms of she and inverse she is based on semiclassical spin diffusion model and does not hold for 2d materials .",
    "since the transport is confined now to an atomic monolayer , an mr generated by an induced proximity exchange potential ( or equilibrium mpe ) appears plausible @xcite . in 3d - systems",
    "this effective interface magnetic field is proportional to the imaginary part of the mixing conductance @xcite that for an interface between a fi and a nonmagnetic metal is relatively small and is usually disregarded @xcite . for graphene on yig ,",
    "a proximity potential of 20@xmath3  ( 0.2 t ) has been reported @xcite , which is smaller than predicted @xcite .",
    "a much larger proximity potential of @xmath4 ( 14 t ) has been reported for graphene on eus @xcite .    in spite of the progress in understanding the magnetoresistance ( mr ) of a magnetized 2deg with rashba soc and the large attention for the ahe in zeeman - split ti surface states , a thorough discussion of the amr / smr  of the latter appears to be lacking .",
    "we therefore report here a theory of the mr of a ti / fi bilayer , modeled as a 2d dirac system with finite exchange splitting , where the latter is a vector parallel to the fi magnetization that can be controlled by applied magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we calculate the electric dc conductivity in magnetized 2d dirac electron system by the kubo formalism and the linearized boltzmann equation with random potential disorder . the equilibrium magnetic proximity effect , i.e. the exchange interaction in the surface state induced by an attached magnet ,",
    "is found to generate an mr that depends on the magnetization orientation .",
    "however , its form differs from both amr and smr . for in - plane magnetizations",
    "the mr vanishes identically in the ti / fi bilayer , while an out - of - plane magnetization causes a large mr ratio .",
    "moreover , we do find an in - plane mr and planar hall effect in the presence of magnetic disorder when aligned with the fi magnetization .",
    "our calculated results agree well with the mr observations .",
