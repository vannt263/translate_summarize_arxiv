    "williams approach , treating a nucleus as a point  like particle and neglecting the coulomb distortion of the wave functions of incoming and outcoming leptons , is a rather well  defined approximation .",
    "the contribution of the finite nuclear radius can be kept at the level of a few percents .",

    "we have shown that the test of cpt invariance in the reactions @xmath297 and @xmath326 reduces to the experimental analysis of the ratio @xmath101 ( [ label1.15 ] ) of the numbers of favourable events detected during an interim @xmath92 . if @xmath104 is a constant in time ",
    "cpt invariance is conserved , and if @xmath104 is an oscillating function in time one can conclude that cpt invariance is violated .",
    "we would like to accentuate that this is a qualitative analysis of cpt invariance . in the case of the ratio @xmath104 oscillating in time we can infer neither a strength nor a nature of a violation of cpt invariance .",
    "we argue that the appearance of longitudinally polarized muons in the final states of the reactions @xmath327 and @xmath328 with longitudinally polarized electrons and positrons is a distinct signal for the production of muonium @xmath7 and anti ",
    "muonium @xmath12 with a total spin @xmath19 .",
    "this should testify that @xmath247 and @xmath329 with a total spin @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , the creation of the @xmath133 pairs in the reactions @xmath330 seems to be the main process competing with the production of muonium and anti  muonium in the reactions @xmath159 and @xmath331 .",
    "the main distinction of the production of the @xmath133 pairs from the production of muonium and anti  muonium is a strong correlation between the momenta and polarizations of @xmath8 and @xmath13 and a decorrelation of them with the initial electron or positron . in turn ,",
    "a strong correlation between the polarizations of the final muons and the initial electron and positron is a feature of the production of muonium and anti  muonium with a total spin @xmath19 in the reactions @xmath297 and @xmath135 .",
    "hence , at first glimpse for the experimental realization of the test of cpt invariance in the reactions @xmath159 and @xmath331 with longitudinally polarized electrons and positrons it suffices to count the number of longitudinally polarized @xmath13 and @xmath8 mesons during an interim @xmath92 . plotting the ratio of these numbers , which should coincide with @xmath104",
