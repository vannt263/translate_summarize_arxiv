    "detecting the ic component should be crucial for probing the magnetic field strength , especially for larger values of @xmath1 . for @xmath101300 - 1000 in fig .",

    "for the range of parameters covered in this study (  [ sec : param ] ) , ic emission often turns out to be the dominant high - energy emission mechanism ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : spiky ] , [ fig : broad ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we find that within plausible parameter regimes , distinctive spectral features can emerge at gev - tev energies due to characteristic processes induced by uhe protons .",
    "one potential radiative signature of uhe protons in grbs is their synchrotron emission , first proposed by @xcite . fig .",

    "another example with high magnetic fields ( @xmath107 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssyn ] . here",
    ", a notable hardening of the spectrum can be seen at @xmath1090.01 - 1 gev , caused by synchrotron emission from secondary pairs injected by photomeson interactions . since primary electrons alone",
    "can not give rise to such distinct features , this is a unique effect triggered by uhe protons , which has not been discussed before for grb prompt emission .",
    "note that in order to correctly evaluate the density of low - energy target photons for the @xmath38 process , it is imperative to include self - absorption effects in the electron synchrotron spectrum (  [ sec : assum ] ) .",
    "although such features should serve as valuable indicators of uhe protons in grbs , it may not be easy from spectral measurements alone to distinguish them from some cases of ic emission .",
    "however , under certain conditions , more than one emission mechanism can become simultaneously important and lead to double spectral breaks , which can only occur in the presence of accelerated protons .",
    "[ fig : double ] is an example where the spectrum hardens above a first break at @xmath110 gev from secondary pair synchrotron emission , and then hardens further above a second break at @xmath111 gev from ic emission .",
    "spectra with such double breaks may offer crucial observational evidence for uhe proton acceleration .    yet",
    "a third proton - induced process that can be significant is synchrotron emission from muons injected by @xmath38 interactions , first discussed by @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : msyn ] , again for high magnetic fields ( @xmath107 ) , a muon synchrotron spectral bump is eminent at @xmath10810 - 100 gev .",
    "additionally visible in this case are secondary pair synchrotron emission at @xmath108 0.1 - 1 gev , proton synchrotron emission at @xmath108 100 gev , and even a minor contribution from pion synchrotron emission at @xmath112 100 gev , illustrating the spectral variety generated by uhe protons . while not shown here , there are other instances where muon synchrotron is the sole high - energy component ( see  [ sec : summa ] ) .",
    "it is important to clarify in which physical regimes of grb internal shocks these proton - related emission components become clearly visible .",

    "[ fig : msyn ] . )    generally speaking , we see that gev - tev emission requires sufficiently large @xmath1 regardless of the emission mechanism to avoid @xmath3 absorption (  [ sec : cutoff ] ) , and that larger @xmath12 is more conducive to proton - induced components .",
    "we also see that cases of multiple components can be fairly common .",
    "a more quantitative summary of the model spectra in the current study can be found in  [ sec : summa ] , which may provide a guide to searches for proton - induced signals in future observations .",
    "while proton - induced emission can become clearly observable , in all the cases studied here , it does not lead to conspicuously separate spectral peaks as for the ic emission .",
    "on the other hand , such situations may be possible outside of the parameter restrictions we set in  [ sec : param ] .",
    "for example , some recent observations may point to @xmath116 if grbs are the origin of uhecrs (  [ sec : uhe ] ) .",
    "all proton - related components will then be duly increased , as they simply scale in proportion to @xmath21 .",
    "although not explicitly addressed in this work , we mention that time variability should also be a crucial diagnostic of emission mechanisms , as each process has its characteristic timescale and dependence on photon energy",
    ". this will be an important subject for future studies .",
    "we now discuss how the above results on gev - tev emission are related to the processes of uhecr and neutrino production in grb internal shocks .",
    "since the internal shock model entails a wide range of physical conditions by design , the circumstances most favorable for each process are not necessarily the same .",
    "we concentrate below on some representative cases without investigating the full model parameter space .",
    "the acceleration of protons to ultra - high energies is a necessary but not sufficient condition for grb internal shocks to be significant contributors of uhecrs , since the particles must also escape efficiently without suffering significant energy losses .",
    "although a detailed description of uhecr escape is beyond the scope of this paper , following @xcite , we can impose a relevant constraint that the particles in question , say , protons with energy @xmath117 ev , do not lose more than half of their energy radiatively in a comoving expansion timescale after their injection in the shell ( roughly @xmath118 ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is a minimum requirement , but if it is satisfied , we may expect that the higher energy particles can eventually escape as the shell expands and both the photon density and magnetic field drop rapidly ( note @xmath119 ) .",
    "we can then infer a lower bound on the shell radius @xmath4 , or equivalently on @xmath1 for given @xmath8 and @xmath76 . from our numerical results , this criterion for efficient uhecr production is approximately @xmath120 cm or @xmath121 .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic field parameter @xmath12 is weak as the losses are mostly due to photomeson interactions rather than synchrotron radiation ( although the latter becomes more important for higher energies @xmath122 ev ) .",
    "note that effective particle escape via neutron conversion is included in this criterion and only occurs in a narrow parameter range near the lower limit values .    turning to gamma - ray emission",
    ", we saw that distinct gev - tev components mandate high values of @xmath1 from @xmath3 optical depth constraints , irrespective of the emission mechanism (  [ sec : cutoff ] ) .",
    "in fact , the above bound on @xmath1 for uhecr production roughly matches the bound from gamma - rays , at least for the two exemplary cases of @xmath8 and @xmath76 in  [ sec : proton ] ( regions outside the black dots in the @xmath12-@xmath1 plane of figs .",
    "[ fig : spiky ] and [ fig : broad ] ) .",
    "therefore , the appearance of even the ic emission may possibly indicate that the physical conditions are also appropriate for efficient uhecr acceleration and escape .",
    "of course , the emergence of proton - induced emission ( only for high @xmath12 ) will be most valuable as it can directly probe important quantities such as @xmath123 and @xmath23 .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos is often emphasized as a definitive observational test of the grb origin of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "however , the situation most advantangeous for neutrino production is that uhe protons undergo efficient photomeson interactions in dense radiation fields without escaping .",
    "this favors small values of @xmath4 or @xmath1 that are contrary to and almost mutually exclusive with the uhecr criterion , as shown in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the requirement that the emitted neutrino fluence @xmath124 in the current model corresponds well with @xmath125 , entirely the opposite of the uhecr bound above .",
    "( see  [ sec : neutrino ] for a summary of the neutrino spectra in the current model . )",
    "taking this constraint at face value , we can find some overlap with the lowest @xmath1 cases with gev - tev components in figs .",
    "[ fig : spiky ] and [ fig : broad ] .",
    "indeed , the pertinent process is found to be secondary pair synchrotron emission , which is generated together with neutrinos in @xmath38 interactions .",
    "yet there is also a large parameter space with even lower @xmath1 that allows copious neutrino emission but very little gamma - ray or uhecr production .",
    "although neutrino observations will still be indispensable to verify that uhe proton acceleration actually occurs in grbs , the bursts that emit the most neutrinos may not be the ones that contribute the most uhecrs .",
    "( such remarks do not apply if uhecr acceleration can occur in external shocks ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ( see however * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * regarding external forward shocks . )",
    "thus we find that the connection between uhecr , neutrino , and gamma - ray production in grb internal shocks is very intimate , but not one - to - one and nontrivial ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "further studies are warranted for a more complete understanding , but this point should be important to bear in mind for the respective observations .",
    "we remark that all of the above discussion is based on the assumption @xmath81 (  [ sec : assum ] ) .",
    "however , recent , post - swift observations reveal the grb redshift distribution to be skewed to higher @xmath126 than previously believed @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that a larger energy budget with @xmath116 may be necessary for grb uhecr scenarios to remain viable , implying correspondingly higher gamma - ray and neutrino contributions .",
    "( note that extreme values such as @xmath127 have also been proposed ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we briefly comment on the implications for existing and future observations .",
    "some egret - detected grbs exhibited gev emission coinciding with the prompt emission , with spectra that are mostly consistent with an extrapolation of the mev spectra @xcite . for grb 940217 , there is some evidence of a separate high - energy component during the prompt phase , and perhaps in the delayed , hour - timescale emission as well @xcite(see also * ? ? ?",

    "a markedly distinct component with a hard spectrum above several mev was seen in grb 941017 @xcite , but the fact that it varied on considerably longer timescales compared to the sub - mev emission may favor an external shock origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at any rate , much more detailed studies of the gev prompt emission should become feasible soon after the launch of glast , which may detect some or all of the emission components discussed here .",
    "although clear detections have yet to be achieved at tev energies , the magic telescope has conducted rapid follow - up observations for selected grbs , in some cases overlapping with the prompt emission phase @xcite .",
    "the obtained upper limits reach fluence levels of @xmath128 at @xmath129 0.1 tev with integration times of several minutes , so our fiducial @xmath70 burst should be readily detectable . estimating the amount of intergalactic attenuation with the baseline background model of @xcite , magic may be able to detect the proton synchrotron emission of fig . [",

    "[ fig : msyn ] out to @xmath130 , and the ic emission of fig .",
    "[ fig : ic ] to somewhat higher @xmath126 , approaching the typical redshifts of grbs .",
    "thus the prospects are very promising for further observations by magic as well as other cerenkov telescopes such as h.e.s.s . , veritas and cangaroo iii , and especially the near - future upgraded facilities magic ii and h.e.s.s .",
    "ii with their lower energy thresholds .",
    "weak evidence of tev photons coincident with grbs have also been reported by some surface detectors , e.g. milagrito @xcite . however , the inferred energy fluxes are much higher than at mev , which is difficult to explain in the current model framework unless extreme parameters are invoked , e.g. @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "more observations are anticipated for such facilities with their wide - field monitoring capabilities , including air shower arrays like argo - ybj @xcite and even the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "following the internal shock scenario and focusing on gev - tev energies , we have modelled the broadband spectra of grb prompt emission through detailed monte carlo simulations including a wide variety of physical processes related to high - energy electrons and protons .",
    "besides electron inverse compton emission , it was shown that interesting proton - induced components such as proton synchrotron , muon synchrotron and secondary pair synchrotron emission can become clearly visible .",
    "multiple component spectra with double breaks may offer unique evidence of ultra - high - energy proton acceleration .",
    "the conditions favorable for gev - tev emission may also imply efficient uhecr acceleration and escape , but not necessarily strong neutrino emission .",
    "the observational prospects are very promising for glast , cerenkov telescopes such as magic ( ii ) , h.e.s.s .",
    "( ii ) , veritas and cangaroo iii , as well as wide - field surface detector facilities . such observations should test the internal shock model of the prompt emission , provide new insights into the physics of grb outflows and central engines , and probe the origin of uhecrs .    note",
    "that since we did not explicitly treat the dynamics of internal shock formation , some aspects of our study may also be valid in more general scenarios , e.g. models involving magnetic energy dissipation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , if electrons and protons can be accelerated with similar energy distributions .",
    "our monte carlo simulations have also allowed detailed studies of the prompt optical emission , with interesting new results concerning both electron- and proton - induced spectral components",
    ". this will be the subject of a separate paper ( asano & inoue , in preparation ) .",
    "more detailed and comprehensive investigations of the current problem should accommodate a wider range of parameters , including dispersions in @xmath72 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , as well as the variety of pulse properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accounting for time variability is also an important goal for the future .",
    "we note that such effects may potentially smooth out some of the more subtler spectral features discussed here and hinder their observational discrimination , except for the case of sufficiently bright brights where time - resolved spectra can be acquired",
    ". our detailed formalism for calculating complicated hadronic interactions and pair cascades should also be useful for other applications , such as high - energy emission from the afterglow phase @xcite .",
    "as this work was being completed , we became aware of a preprint by @xcite that addresses issues similar to this paper , albeit it with a simpler , analytic formulation .",
    "we thank f. aharonian , z. bosnjak , e. parizot , m. teshima and especially f. daigne for very valuable discussions .",
    "when ic emission is dominant at high - energies (  [ sec : ic ] ) , the ic peak energy @xmath132 and the ic to synchrotron peak fluence ( @xmath133 ) ratio may allow a useful consistency check of the internal shock model within the parameter space of the present study (  [ sec : param ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aa ] , we summarize the dependence of these two quantities on @xmath8 , @xmath76 , @xmath1 and @xmath12 . roughly speaking , @xmath134 , which is similar to the expression for @xmath95 (  [ sec : cutoff ] ) and sensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "the peak fluence ratio does not vary monotonically with @xmath76 as it is affected by @xmath3 absorption at large @xmath76 .",
    "the ic peak is suppressed for larger @xmath12 and disappears for @xmath107 .",
    "a large variety of high - energy spectra are realized in the current model .",
    "those with a clear excess above a simple extrapolation of the mev - band spectrum are summarized quantitatively in the @xmath8-@xmath76 parameter plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] .",
    "in the current model , two types of neutrino spectra can occur @xcite .",
    "when photopion cooling of protons is efficient , the neutrino number spectrum @xmath135 reflecting that of protons , with a high - energy break at which the synchrotron cooling time of the parent pion or muon equals their lifetime @xcite , and a low energy break at which the photopion cooling time of the parent proton equals @xmath136 . in contrast , for inefficient photopion cooling , the spectrum has only one break corresponding to the latter and no portion @xmath137 .",
    "[ fig : ac ] summarizes these characteristic break energies @xmath138 when the neutrino fluence @xmath139 .",
