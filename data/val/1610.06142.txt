    "since nonlinear simulations of sheared flows show that they often give rise to secondary instabilities@xcite , this suggests that the growth rates of these secondary instabilities depend significantly on the amplitude of stable modes of the primary instability in a turbulent state .    in standard descriptions of turbulence and quasilinear transport calculations",
    "it is common practice to neglect stable modes .",
    "this is typically justified by their linear exponential decay from an infinitesimal initial value . in this calculation",
    "we will account for the nonlinear drive of the stable mode by the unstable mode and investigate its impact on the evolution of the system .",
    "in the previous calculations of stable mode excitation@xcite , arbitrary perturbations of dynamical quantities such as flow and pressure about an unstable equilibrium were expanded as linear combinations of the eigenmodes . because the systems were homogeneous , the dynamical quantities of interest were the fourier transforms of flows and pressures , and the governing systems of pdes became systems of odes ( describing the time - dependence of the fourier amplitudes ) .",
    "the linear eigenmodes of the system were functions of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the expansion of the perturbations in terms of the eigenmodes took the following form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 was the number of eigenmodes ( also the number of dynamical fields considered ) , @xmath70 , etc .",
    "are the components of the @xmath71th eigenvector , and @xmath72 is the contribution of the @xmath71th eigenmode to the state of the system at @xmath73 , also called the eigenmode amplitude .",
    "the full nonlinear odes that describe the evolution of the perturbations were written in terms of the eigenmodes by substituting the dynamical quantities for the eigenmodes using eq .  .",
    "with some algebraic manipulations , the original nonlinear equations for @xmath74 , etc .  transform to equations for @xmath75 .",
    "these new odes are equivalent to the equations that govern the original dynamical system , but instead describe the nonlinear evolution of the system in terms of the eigenmode amplitudes .",
    "we refer to this process , both the expansion of the perturbations and the manipulation of their governing equations , as an eigenmode projection .",
    "the odes for the eigenmode amplitudes provide powerful insight into the system .",
    "the nonlinearities that couple the dynamical fields at different scales become nonlinearities that couple each of the eigenmodes at every scale .",
    "thus , it was shown ( and borne out by many simulations@xcite ) that despite decaying in the linear regime , the stable modes are driven by the unstable modes through the nonlinearity .    by comparing the magnitude of the nonlinearities that transfer energy to stable modes to the magnitude of the nonlinearities that cause the kolmogorov - like cascade of energy from an unstable mode at one scale to the same mode at another scale",
    ", one can investigate how important stable modes are in instability saturation .",
    "a quantity known as the threshold parameter that evaluates the relative importance of the stable eigenmodes in instability saturation has been derived from the eigenmode - projected odes .",
    "if the threshold parameter is small compared to unity , it indicates that the instability saturates via a kolmogorov - like transfer of energy to smaller scales , and only the term in eq .   corresponding to the most unstable eigenmode",
    "need be included to accurately describe the system .",
    "if the threshold parameter is of order a few tenths or larger , it indicates the transfer of energy from the unstable mode to other modes at the same scale is an important mechanism in saturation .",
    "additional terms in eq .   must therefore be included .    in these previous calculations ,",
    "the homogeneous nature of the system made the set of linear eigenmodes a complete basis : at every time @xmath76 and wavevector @xmath67 , the linear modes modes could be used to expand the state of the system ( i.e.  eq .  ) . due to the inhomogeneity of the present system , the linear solutions are nt simply fourier modes in @xmath1 , so this system does not readily lend itself to the vector representation of ref .",
    "moreover , eq .   admits only two eigenmodes which likely do not span arbitrary perturbations that satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "so the true state of the system can not be written exactly in the form of eq .",
    "with @xmath77 . in order to properly describe the evolution of the system given an arbitrary initial condition , the system could be expanded in appropriate orthogonal polynomials or investigated as an initial value problem with additional time - dependent basis functions that are linear solutions of the problem .",
    "previous work has demonstrated that for inviscid shear flows the initial value calculation leads to the  discrete \" eigenmodes with time - dependence @xmath78 described in the previous section , and an additional set of  continuum \" modes@xcite .",
    "these continuum modes either oscillate with frequency @xmath79 or decay algebraically .",
    "for the present calculation we only consider perturbations that can be expressed as linear combinations of the two discrete eigenmodes @xmath64 and @xmath61 , representing a truncation of the complete system . if we are able to demonstrate a significant impact from @xmath61 , that suffices to demonstrate the importance of stable modes , relative to existing models that only consider the unstable mode .    by focusing on perturbations that are linear combinations of @xmath64 and @xmath61 , the vector representation and invertible linear transformation between the state of the system and the eigenmode amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite can be recovered .",
    "consequently , the governing equation , eq .  , can be manipulated to derive nonlinear equations that describe the evolution of the eigenmode amplitudes and their interactions .",
    "the method relies on the jump conditions given in eq .  .",
    "since the jump conditions for one eigenmode differ from those for the other eigenmode , one can form an invertible map between the discontinuity of @xmath34 at each interface and the amplitude of each eigenmode . additionally , because there are two jump conditions that will serve as our dynamical quantities , only the two eigenmodes of the previous section are needed to construct an invertible map between eigenmodes and dynamical quantities . to derive equations describing the nonlinear interaction between the eigenmodes , we start by deriving nonlinear jump conditions .",
    "first , let @xmath80 $ ] be the fourier transformed ( in @xmath0 ) stream function , and assume @xmath81 the nonlinear jump conditions are obtained by performing the same steps that led to eq .   without dropping nonlinear terms ( and explicitly taking the fourier transform rather than assuming normal modes ) .",

    "<S> the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability , which arises in astrophysical and fusion systems with inhomogeneous flows , has an unstable and a stable mode at the same scales . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in kh turbulence , as in other types of turbulence , the stable mode is nonlinearly excited , affecting transport and nonlinearly removing energy from the inertial - range cascade to small scales . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify energy transfer to stable modes and its associated impact on turbulent amplitudes and transport , demonstrating that stable modes regulate transfer in kh systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a quasilinear momentum transport calculation is performed to quantify the reduction in momentum transport due to stable modes . </S>"
