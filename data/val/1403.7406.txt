    "a typical rainfall time series has several properties that are difficult to capture in a simple statistical model , including a heavily skewed marginal distribution that is distinctly non - gaussian , a large proportion of zero values , and frequent large fluctuations .",
    "thus there is a need for specialised models for rainfall which can capture the unique characteristics of this type of process .",
    "the existing literature on modelling rainfall is large and spread over fields such as hydrology , atmospheric sciences , environmental risk analysis and statistics .",
    "@xcite classifies the different approaches into four categories : meteorological models based on large sets of differential equations , multi - scale models concerned with the spatial evolution of rainfall , statistical models that capture spatial and temporal trends , and finally stochastic process models that make simple assumptions in order to remain parsimonious . in the following",
    "we will focus on models of the last category .",
    "many of the early attempts at modelling rainfall use a simple model that represents the rainfall occurrence process as a two - state markov chain , and models the intensity of rainfall with a gamma distribution  @xcite .",
    "this model is easy to interpret and enables the direct use of likelihood methods for fitting .",
    "however , it makes several restrictive assumptions on the rainfall process , and may require a high - order markov chain with many parameters to capture observed temporal dependence .",
    "there is also a large literature on modelling rainfall for hydrological applications based on a form of the poisson - cluster model , first developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model is based on a hierarchical structure , with a primary poisson process controlling the arrival of storms and a secondary process generating cells from each storm , which then deposit rainfall .",
    "there have been numerous extensions of the poisson - cluster model that focus on fitting specific properties of the observed rainfall process .",
    "for example , @xcite considers an extended model that allows for different rainfall cell types , where each cell has a random duration and intensity depending on its type , allowing for the different types of precipitation that are observed in practice .    in terms of fitting specific properties of rainfall that are of interest for hydrological applications , extensions to the poisson - cluster model",
    "generally perform very well .",
    "however , as remarked by @xcite , there is always a trade - off between the inclusion of more features and the mathematical tractability of the resulting models .",
    "poisson - cluster based models are usually fitted by the method of moments , which involves matching analytical expressions for properties such as the mean , variance , and proportion of dry intervals to their empirical equivalents .",
    "@xcite , remarks that the method of moments approach `` suffers from the disadvantage that the parameter estimates can vary greatly depending on the properties used in the fitting procedure '' , and proposes a spectral estimation method for estimating rainfall models based on point processes .",
    "the contribution of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we develop a parsimonious and analytically tractable model that captures the distributional features and autocorrelation structure of the observed rainfall time series .",
    "we relate the model to the framework of lvy - driven , continuous - time arma ( carma ) processes , and use this connection to develop a suitable fitting method , which is illustrated using empirical rainfall data .",
    "the model structure may be interpreted as a non - clustered poisson model with multiple cell types , cf .",
    "the main benefit of this model is its parsimonious formulation based on a stochastic integral , making it suitable for applications where mathematical tractability and fitting methodology are of primary importance .",
    "second , we derive a formula specifying the so - called risk - neutral distribution of a general class of lvy - driven stochastic processes , which includes our model as a special case .",
    "we then use this result to calculate prices for rainfall futures based on our model .",
    "rainfall derivatives were introduced at the chigago merchantile exchange ( cme ) in 2010 , as a recent addition to the class of weather - related products .",
    "these products have a large potential market in all economic sectors that depend on favourable weather conditions , such as farming and energy development .",
    "the literature on rainfall derivatives pricing is currently rather limited .",
    "because the underlying rainfall can not be traded directly , the rainfall derivative market is incomplete , and thus there is no single fixed price for the derivative . due to this incompleteness",
    ", there are several distinct methods that can be used for rainfall derivative pricing .",
    "it appears that most current approaches rely on either the utility indifference approach or risk - neutral pricing using the esscher transform .",
    "the utility indifference approach is used in @xcite . in this paper a modification of the poisson - cluster model is considered , which makes the rainfall intensity a markov jump process , thus enabling maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "this modification relies on the assumption that the data used , though inevitably discrete , approximates continuous - time observations of the rainfall intensity .",
    "@xcite also use the utility indifference approach for pricing hypothetical rainfall derivatives in kenya , based on a markov - gamma model with seasonality .",
    "a natural choice for pricing based on lvy process models is the esscher transform @xcite , as it is structure - preserving @xcite and moreover gives rise to a minimal entropy martingale measure @xcite .",
    "@xcite use the esscher transform for pricing based on a version of the daily rainfall model by @xcite .",
    "they fit simulated monthly rainfall totals to a normal inverse gaussian distribution , and use the esscher transform to obtain a risk - neutral distribution .",
    "@xcite also use the esscher transform for pricing , but base their underlying rainfall model on an independent increment process .",
    "in contrast to the markov - gamma and independent increment models that have been used for pricing rainfall derivatives , our proposed model has the advantage of not making assumptions about temporal independence or markovianity of the rainfall process increments . furthermore , the model and the fitting method used are based on the assumption that the available data represents accumulated rainfall , i.e.  the instantaneous intensity can not be directly observed , which is typically the case for applications . by allowing for temporal dependence and considering carma processes of arbitrary order",
    ", we obtain a model with a flexible autocorrelation structure , which is particularly relevant for data on finer time scales .",
    "this flexibility is illustrated by fitting the model to hourly rainfall data .",
    "we also compare our model to that given in @xcite , which was used in @xcite for pricing rainfall futures based on daily data from detroit .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section 2 discusses characteristic features of the rainfall process in light of data from different locations and time scales .",
    "section 3 presents the rainfall model and shows how it fits into the continuous - time arma ( carma ) model framework .",
    "section 4 gives details on the fitting method , and section 5 investigates the model performance using empirical data . in section 6",
    "we derive a method for pricing rainfall derivatives based on our model .",
    "in this section we motivate the structure of our model by illustrating some of the characterising features of rainfall time series .",
    "we base this illustration on two data sets which will be used throughout this paper : the first consists of hourly accumulated rainfall amounts at heathrow ( uk ) over the years 1980 - 2012 , provided by the @xcite .",
    "the second data set gives daily accumulated rainfall amounts in detroit ( us ) over the years 1980 - 2010 , provided by bloomberg professional service .",
    "figure [ detroit_heathrow_3yrs ] shows the rainfall time series for both locations over the years 2008 - 2010 .",
    "these plots illustrate that the rainfall process is subject to sudden transitions between periods with little or no rain and periods of higher intensity , causing the large spikes in the graph .",
    "there is also a large amount of zero values in both data sets , as shown in table [ zerotable ] .",
    "because the data is rounded to the nearest unit of measurement ( @xmath0 mm for the heathrow data and @xmath1 inch for the detroit data ) , these zero values represent all data points with a value smaller than this unit .",
    "the proportion of zero values is dependent on the measurement time scale , with fewer zero values for the daily data .",
    "this is because periods with no rainfall must persist throughout the measurement time interval in order to induce a value of zero in the data .",
    ".percentage of rainfall measurements equal to zero . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have introduced a new class of continuous - time stochastic processes , driven by the hougaard lvy process , and shown how it can be used to construct a parsimonious and analytically tractable model for rainfall . by generalising the ornstein - uhlenbeck process representing rainfall intensity to a continuous - time arma ( carma ) process",
    ", we obtain a model with a very flexible autocorrelation structure .",
    "we presented a general fitting method for this class which exploits a correspondence between integrated carma and arma processes .",
    "we showed that the model fits the marginal distribution of the rainfall very well on both hourly and daily time scales .",
    "in particular , the marginal fit for daily rainfall is better than that of the standard model described in @xcite , and we also obtain an adequate fit to the mean and marginal distribution on a month - by - month basis .    by virtue of the carma generalisation , the extended model manages to accurately reproduce the autocorrelation structure of the observed rainfall , a characterising feature of the process which becomes increasingly significant for smaller time scales .",
    "the last part of the paper gives a result specifying the risk - neutral expectation of a function of the rainfall process , which can be used for pricing general derivatives written on a precipitation index . to construct a risk - neutral measure we use the esscher transform , with a time - dependent parameter representing the risk premium .",
    "we state the result for a general moving average process , a class which includes our model as a special case .",
    "the pricing methodology constitutes an important generalisation of the independent increment model considered in @xcite , which does not allow for price dynamics of derivatives .",
    "we illustrated the pricing method by calculating futures prices based on empirical daily rainfall data from detroit , and showed how they can be calibrated to observed prices .",
    "given a sufficient amount of price data , one can study the properties of the market price of risk ( mpr ) that is implied by this calibration . @xcite discuss the market price of weather risk , focusing on temperature derivatives , and provides an example of modelling the mpr of temperature derivatives as a deterministic function of the seasonal temperature variation .",
    "as the market for rainfall derivatives matures , one could conduct a similar study for the mpr of rainfall derivatives .",
