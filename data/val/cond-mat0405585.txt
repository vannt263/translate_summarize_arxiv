    "one of the widely accepted results of the disordered systems is that in one - dimensional spaces all the electronic states in independent site - energy random ( diagonal disorder ) anderson model with non - random hopping amplitudes are exponentially localized @xcite .",
    "the diffusion or long - range transport of the initially localized particle in such systems is absent regardless the strength of the disorder .",
    "the same result is proved rigorously for quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well established that the type of disorder can have a strong effect on localization properties of disordered systems .",
    "for instance , in one - dimensional systems with off - diagonal disorder ( random hopping models ) delocalization takes place at the band center @xcite . in quasi - one - dimensional systems with off - diagonal disorder",
    "the picture is more complicated .",
    "it appeared @xcite , that in a weakly disordered @xmath0-leg quasi - one - dimensional disordered tight - binding hopping model there is a delocalization transition at the critical energy @xmath1 if and only if @xmath0 is odd ( including @xmath2 case ) .",
    "the wave - functions remain localized for even @xmath0 .",
    "the localization properties of two- and three - channel tight - binding anderson model with nearest - neighbor inter - chain hopping was studied in @xcite .",
    "another possibility to have localization - delocalization transition in one dimension is the correlated disorder , when the random variables are correlated at short or long distances .",
    "there is intensive current interest both theoretical ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) and experimental @xcite concerning analyze of conditions , under which delocalized states can appear .",
    "this kind of models with correlated disorder give explanation of high conductivity of polymers such as doped poly - aniline and also describe the transport properties of random semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "some transport properties of many - mode waveguides with rough surfaces were studied in @xcite and the possibility of perfect transmission due to some specific long - range correlations in the surface profiles was investigated .",
    "the scaling properties of the models with correlated disorder were studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , that universality of one parameter scaling breaks down in presence of long range correlated disorder , for instance in the periodic - on - average systems .",
    "it is necessary to point out , that the correlated disordered systems do not belong to zirnbauer s @xcite and caselle s @xcite classification of fully disordered systems on the basis of cartan s classification of symmetric spaces .",
    "that happens because , due to correlations , the brownian motion of the effective degrees of freedom carries out on the restricted part of the coset space .",
    "this restriction is general characteristic of all correlated disordered systems .",
    "so far the discussion of correlated disorder was applied only to strictly one - dimensional systems . in order to analyze the existence of localization - delocalization transition in higher dimensional lattices with correlated disorder ,",
    "it is natural to make the first step in this direction  to study the quasi - one - dimensional systems . to investigate the existence of critical point and address the problem of delocalization transition in this case analytically is an important task .",
    "the exact calculation of landauer localization length and critical indices will allow us to understand whether numerical simulation of lyapunov exponent shows truly critical point ( where the localization length is infinite ) or an extended state ( where the localization length is finite , but exceeds the system size ) .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the extension of the random dimer model ( rdm ) @xcite to quasi - one - dimensional case and show the existence of delocalization transition for particular realization of correlation .",
    "namely , we consider a two - leg ladder chain ( see fig.1 ) and a tight - binding model of random binary alloy with on - site potential fields taking values @xmath3 from the group @xmath4 , randomly assigned to the lattice sites with probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , correspondingly . here",
    "we will focus on a particular case , when the same site potentials appear always by quartets disposed on four nearest neighbor sites creating squares , as it is marked on the fig.1 .",
    "this is most natural generalization of the rdm in case of ladder models , and one can call it random ladder dimer model ( rldm ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rldm is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constant vertical and horizontal hopping parameters correspondingly , @xmath10 is the random external potential at site @xmath11 of the @xmath12-th chain .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the number of atoms in each chain .",
    "we impose a constraint on the randomness by demanding that four @xmath13 around the plaquette ( see fig.1 ) always have the same , but randomly chosen value from the set @xmath14",
    "@xmath15    in section [ closed ]",
    "we study the closed system described by hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "we use the technique introduced in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and further applied to the rdm in @xcite in order to investigate the rldm .",
    "we calculate analytically the dimensionless landauer exponent of the model and compare it with numerical simulations of the lyapunov exponent ( fig.2 and fig.3 ) , calculated iteratively in standard way @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation of the landauer resistance shows the existence of one real critical point with critical energy @xmath1 in the case of @xmath16 . otherwise all states are localized .",
    "in the case of @xmath17 we analytically analyze the divergence of the inverse of landauer exponent and find , that there is delocalization with the critical index @xmath18 . on fig.2 and fig.3",
    "we see very good coincidence of the half of landauer exponent with the lyapunov one around the critical point .",
    "the critical behavior is essentially different when @xmath19 . in this case",
    "also the localization length diverges at the point @xmath1 , but with index @xmath20 .",
    "the comparison of landauer and lyapunov exponents for this case is presented on fig.4 .",
    "the numerical analyze of the density of states ( dos ) shows anomalous behavior at the band center in the case , when @xmath21 ( see fig.5 ) and regular behavior for @xmath22 ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "section [ open ] is devoted to the open counterpart of the system described by ( [ h ] ) .",
    "there we show that far from the delocalization point the distributions of the wigner delay times are very similar to those found for the random models with uncorrelated disorder ( fig .  [ fig1 ] and fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "at the critical point the behavior of the distribution depends on @xmath23 .",
    "namely , for @xmath24 the distribution of the re - scaled wigner delay times tends to the @xmath25-function ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , corresponding to the deterministic , ballistic propagation . while for @xmath26 this distribution is not deterministic , but still bounded ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , indicating the ballistic propagation with velocities distributed in some interval .",
    "for one particle eigenstates @xmath27 of the eigenenergy @xmath28 the schrdinger equation of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) has the following recursion form : @xmath29 now we can rewrite ( [ shr ] ) in the matrix form @xmath30 by introducing @xmath31 transfer matrix @xmath32 as @xmath33 here we re - scaled the energies and the vertical hopping parameter @xmath8 ( introducing @xmath34 instead ) by the horizontal hopping parameter @xmath9 .",
    "one can easily find out , that the @xmath31 transfer matrix @xmath32 possesses the condition @xmath35 with @xmath36 which means that @xmath32 is an element of the group @xmath37 .",
    "if we introduce a new matrix @xmath38 , then we can relate the wave functions @xmath39 with ones at sites 0 and 1 of both chains @xmath40 and @xmath41 will denote the total transfer matrix of the system . from the definition of @xmath41 it is obvious , that it has the same property @xmath42 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the flux conservation in the theory ( i.e. , hermiticity of @xmath43 ) .    in a physics of disorder particular interests has the limit of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "according to oseledec theorem @xcite this limit exists and the maximal eigenvalue is called lyapunov exponent .",
    "due to self averaging property it is determined by the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath41 @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the average is taken over random distribution of the external potential taking into account the correlations ( if they are present in the model under consideration ) .",
    "it is hard to calculate the lyapunov exponent exactly and establish the presence of delocalization point .",
    "another variable , which shares the essential characteristics of the localization - delocalization transition but can be calculated exactly is the dimensionless landauer resistance , which is defined as the ratio of squares of the modules of the reflection and transmission amplitudes . according to arguments of anderson",
    "@xcite in one - dimensional systems the landauer exponent ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ ld ] ) ) is simply the double of lyapunov one .",
    "the proportionality of these two exponents was confirmed around of the critical point in the paper @xcite .",
    "considering in most general terms one dimensional models with transfer matrices belonging to @xmath48 authors of @xcite have shown , that in the lowest order of perturbation expansion with some parameter measuring the distance from the critical point , the landauer exponent is twice the lyapunov one , just as predicted by @xcite .",
    "this means , that critical indices of both exponents are equal . in quasi - one dimensional models , which have transfer matrix from @xmath49 ,",
    "again one can expect the coincidence of critical indices .",
    "the exponential increase of landauer resistance with distance is determined by the landauer exponent , which can be defined as @xmath50 in the articles @xcite-@xcite it was shown , that the landauer resistance ( and corresponding exponent ) can be calculated exactly just by reducing the direct product @xmath51 of fundamental representations of transfer matrices @xmath52 of @xmath48 group to the adjoint one .",

    "[ fig3 ] the distribution of the rescaled wigner delay times @xmath196 goes to the @xmath25-function in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this means that with the probability one the particle propagates through the sample ballistically with a fixed velocity .",
    "the ballistic propagation is compatible with the delocalization taking place at this point .",
    "the deterministic character of the distribution is however not trivial and can not be deduced from the delocalization only .",
    "this becomes very clear when we choose @xmath197 .",
    "the distribution of the rescaled times ( fig .",

    "our results shows that its behavior ranges from @xmath194 decay typical for the localized system to the deterministic one at the critical point for @xmath143 .",
    "our analytical and numerical results can be relevant for photoluminescence experiments on electronic properties of gaas - algaas superlattices @xcite and for experiment on a microwave waveguide with inserted correlated scatterers @xcite .    at the end",
    "we would like to make a following remark .",
    "the dimer model with the correlated disorder defined here does not belong to the classification of fully disordered systems on the basis of symmetric spaces @xcite .",
    "this is because the geometry of integration space over random variables , due to the restriction imposed by correlations , does not coincide with geometry of symmetric spaces .",
    "the classification of universality classes of the correlated disordered systems is an open and interesting problem .",
