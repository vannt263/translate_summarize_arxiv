    "when a strong field is applied to a macroscopically heterogeneous or composite medium , the induced change of the medium can lead to quite interesting behavior , both in electrical transport and in optical response @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are most pronounced in the case of periodic composites . in the case of a cubic lattice of dipoles , elementary ( dipole lattice )",
    "arguments show that the correction to the lorentz cavity field ( due to all the dipoles inside the cavity ) strictly vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , when the lattice symmetry is lowered by an external means , e.g. , under the influence of an external force / torque , the lattice is deformed , either lengthened in one direction and/or contracted in the other direction , the correction to the cavity field will not vanish .",
    "we call this phenomenon the geometric anisotropy @xcite",
    ". the lattice deformation can easily be realized by the electrorheological effect on a suspension of polarized particles , in which the particles aggregate into anisotropic structures . in this work",
    ", we will apply the ewald - kornfeld formulation @xcite to a tetragonal lattice of point dipoles , in an attempt to obtain a convergence of the infinite lattice sum and hence examine the effects of geometric anisotropy on the local field distribution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will consider a tetragonal lattice of point dipoles and apply the ewald - kornfeld formulation to calculate the local field . in section iii ,",
    "we perform numerical calculation and the various problems encountered in the computation of the conditionally convergent summation of the near field will be addressed . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the relation between the present formulation with the established local field concepts .",
    "we will show that the change in the local field can lead to a generalized clausius - mossotti equation valid for the anisotropic case .",
    "discussion on related problems will be given .",
    "consider a tetragonal lattice with lattice constant @xmath0 along the z - axis and lattice constant @xmath1 along the x and y axes . in this way",
    ", the degree of anisotropy is measured by how @xmath2 is deviated from unity and the uniaxial anisotropic axis is along the z - axis .",
    "the lattice constants have been chosen so that the volume of the unit cell @xmath3 remains unchanged as @xmath2 varies .",
    "the lattice vector is given by @xmath4where @xmath5 are integers .",
    "there are @xmath6 point dipoles @xmath7 located at @xmath8 in a unit cell . the local electric field @xmath9 at a particular point dipole at @xmath8 can be expressed as a sum of the electric field of all dipoles at @xmath10 : @xmath11where `` prime '' denotes a restricted summation which excludes @xmath12 when @xmath13 and @xmath14is the dipole interaction tensor .",
    "eq.([dipole - sum ] ) can be recast in the ewald - kornfeld form @xcite : @xmath15      \\nonumber \\\\   & - & { 4\\pi \\over v_c } \\sum_{{\\bf g } \\neq 0 }     { 1\\over g^2 } \\exp \\left(-{g^2\\over 4\\eta^2 } \\right )     [ ( { \\bf p}_i \\cdot { \\bf g } ) \\exp(i{\\bf g } \\cdot { \\bf r}_i )     \\sum_j ( { \\bf p}_j \\cdot { \\bf g } ) \\exp(-i{\\bf g } \\cdot { \\bf r}_j ) ]     \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { 4\\eta^3 p_i^2 \\over 3\\sqrt{\\pi } } , \\label{e - k}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is an adjustable parameter and * g * is a reciprocal lattice vector : @xmath18the @xmath19 and @xmath20 coefficients are given by : @xmath21where @xmath22 is the complementary error function .",
    "thus the dipole lattice sum of eq.([dipole - sum ] ) becomes a summation over the real lattice vector * r * as well as the reciprocal lattice vector * g*. here we have considered an infinite lattice . for finite lattices , one must be careful about the effects of different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we should remark that although a tetragonal lattice is considered , eq.([e - k ] ) is applicable to arbitrary bravais lattices .",
    "the adjustable parameter @xmath17 is chosen so that both the summations in the real and reciprocal lattices converge most rapidly . in what follows ,",
    "we will limit ourselves to one dipole per unit cell , and the ewald - kornfeld summation [ eq.([e - k ] ) ] can be carried out .",
    "we will consider two cases depending on whether the dipole moment is parallel or perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis . in both cases",
    ", we will compute the local field as a function of the degree of anisotropy @xmath2 .",
    "consider the longitudinal field case : @xmath23 , i.e. , the dipole moments being along the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",
    "the local field * e * at the the lattice point * r * = 0 reduces to @xmath24    - { 4\\pi p\\over v_c } \\sum_{{\\bf g}\\neq 0}{g_z^2\\over g^2 }    \\exp\\left({-g^2\\over 4\\eta^2}\\right ) + { 4p\\eta^3\\over { 3\\sqrt\\pi}},\\end{aligned}\\]]and @xmath25 . the local field will be computed by summing over all integer indices , @xmath26 for the summation in the real lattice and @xmath27 for that in the reciprocal lattice .",
    "because of the exponential factors , we may impose an upper limit to the indices , i.e. , all indices ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is a positive integer . for @xmath30",
    ", the regions of summation will be rectangular rather than cubic in both the real and reciprocal lattices .",
    "the computation has been repeated for various degree of anisotropy with @xmath2 ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 .",
    "a plateau value for @xmath31 is found for each @xmath2 within a certain range of @xmath17 values , indicating that convergence of the local field has indeed been achieved with the upper limit @xmath32 .    for a larger anisotropy ,",
    "however , there have been two problems associated with the computation of the conditionally convergent summation : ( 1 ) the range of @xmath17 that gives the plateau value shrinks as @xmath2 increases .",
    "even no plateau value could be observed , say , for @xmath33 . in this case , the summation may still converge but possibly for a much larger @xmath29 and the computation time may be prohibitive .",
    "( 2 ) the local field can be used to evaluate the depolarization factor @xmath34 , defined by : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total dipole moment per unit volume .",
    "the near field is the @xmath37 limiting value of the short - range part of the summation .",
    "we find that if a direct summation over the near field is performed , @xmath34 fluctuates seriously with the increase of @xmath29 , which is unacceptable .    in order to overcome these problems ,",
    "the region of summation has been taken to be inside a sphere of radius @xmath38 in the real lattice , and that of radius @xmath39 in the reciprocal lattice , where @xmath40 is a positive integer .",
    "all the contribution from the dipoles outside the sphere will be discarded . in this way",
    ", those dipoles that contribute significantly to the local field but were not considered in the rectangular box are included in the summation . as a result",
    ", the computation time can be shortened as a much smaller value of @xmath40 can be used for convergence .",
    "the summation is repeated with increasing @xmath40 for convergence .",
    "we find that the summation indeed converges to a plateau value within a wide range of @xmath17 even for large anisotropy .    the second problem is also overcome by the summation over a sphere .",
    "although there are still some fluctuations of the @xmath34 value , the amplitude of fluctuation is greatly reduced .",
    "we find that @xmath34 converges to 0.33 at @xmath41 .",
    "physically , it reminds us that @xmath34 is exactly equal to @xmath42 , independent of the degree of anisotropy .",
    "this implies that the far field is always equal to @xmath43 , as from far away , the lattice structure is irrelevant .",
    "what concerned us is just the total dipole moment per unit volume .",
    "the fluctuation around @xmath44 is attributed to the slow convergence and rapid fluctuation of the near field , rather than the local field which converges more rapidly .",
    "this analysis thus provides us an accurate means of finding the near field by subtracting the far field , i.e. , @xmath43 , from the local field .    for the transverse field case in which the dipole moments are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , eq.(8 ) can still be applied to evaluate the local field by modifying @xmath45 to @xmath46 while taking the gradient along the direction of the dipole , say the x - axis , and obtain the expression of the local field .",
    "the results of the local field strength ( normalized to @xmath47 ) against @xmath48 for the longitudinal and transverse field cases are plotted in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) respectively . for comparison , the near field",
    "is also plotted on the same figure .",
    "the near field vanishes at @xmath49 , in accord with the previous result .",
    "as @xmath2 decreases , the local field for the longitudinal field case increases rapidly while that for the transverse field case decreases rapidly . in both cases ,",
    "when @xmath2 deviates from unity , the effect of geometric anisotropy has a pronounced effect on the local field strengths .",
    "our present theory is of microscopic origin , in the sense that we have computed the lattice summation by the ewald - kornfeld formulation .",
    "we have not invoked any macroscopic concepts like the lorentz cavity field @xcite in the calculations . however , to corroborate with these established concepts can lead to a modification of the clausius - mossotti equation valid for the anisotropic case .",
    "more precisely , we use the result of the local field to evaluate the effective polarizability @xmath50 of the dipole lattice , which is given by : @xmath51where @xmath52 is the polarizability of an isolated dipole , and @xmath53 is the local field factor . note that @xmath54 when @xmath49 . to see this , the total field acting on a dipole is the sum of the applied field @xmath55 and the local field due to all other dipoles , hence @xmath56 where @xmath55 is the applied electric field .",
    "let @xmath57 , the above equation becomes a self - consistent equation . solving yields @xmath58",
    "the effective dielectric constant @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 .",
    "for a cubic lattice , @xmath54 , @xmath59 satisfies the well - known clausius - mossotti equation : @xmath61thus eq.(9 ) represents a generalization of the clausius - mossotti equation to the anisotropic lattice .",
    "the result of the effective polarizability is plotted against @xmath62 in fig.1(c ) for the longitudinal field case while in fig.1(d ) for the transverse field case with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for a small @xmath65 , the effective polarizability is almost independent of @xmath2 .",
    "however , for a larger @xmath66 , the effective polarizability exhibits similar behavior as the local field . as @xmath2 decreases , @xmath50 for the longitudinal field case increases rapidly while that for the transverse field case decreases rapidly .",
    "again , when @xmath2 deviates from unity , the effect of geometric anisotropy has a strong impact on the effective polarizability .",
    "a problem with the lorentz theory is in regard to its generalization to polar media with permanent dipole moments @xmath67 .",
    "a simple replacement of the polarizability @xmath52 by @xmath52 + @xmath68 in the clausius - mossotti relation leads to a divergent dielectric constant , a phenomenon known as the polarization catastrophy . in 1936",
    ", onsager @xcite resolved this problem by introducing a reaction field : while the lorentz local field at the origin is due to all dipole moments of the lattice in the absence of the dipole moment at the origin , the reaction field at the origin arises from the additional polarization of the surrounding dipole moments due to the dipole moment @xmath69 at the origin .    in the present case ,",
    "the onsager reaction field at the origin is given by : @xmath70where @xmath52 is the bare polarizability and t is the dipole interaction tensor @xmath71unlike the summation of the local field , the infinite sum [ eq.([reaction ] ) ] for the onsager reaction field is indeed absolutely convergent .",
    "no ewald - kornfeld formulation is needed because the product t : t is positive definite . for a simple cubic lattice of dipole moments , by summing over nearest neighbors , the result is : @xmath72 which is already close to the infinite lattice limit @xmath73 .",
    "it is instructive to extend the consideration to anisotropic lattices .",
    "the reaction field is conveniently expressed as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the reaction field factor .",
    "again , the summation over sphere has helped the convergence .",
    "we perform the direct summation in the real lattice to obtain the reaction field factor for various @xmath2 ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 . in fig.2(a ) and ( b ) , we plot @xmath75 versus @xmath48 for the longitudinal and transverse field cases respectively .",
    "there is a minimum @xmath75 around @xmath49 ( but not exactly at @xmath49 ) in both cases and @xmath75 increases rapidly when @xmath2 deviates from unity . as evident from fig.2 ,",
    "the effect of geometry anisotropy has a strong impact on the reaction field strength .",
    "here a few comments on the results are in order .",
    "we should remark that the present work employs the electrostatic ( dipole ) approximation . while such an approximation is simpler to implement and suffices in many cases , for optical properties of composites of metallic particles embedded in a dielectric host medium , however",
    ", one must go beyond the electrostatic approximation @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend the present theory to statistical geometric anisotropy @xcite , e.g. , that being induced by the electrorheological effects @xcite .",
    "we may also extend the formulation to a randomly dilute lattice of dipoles to mimic mixed magnetic and nonmagnetic ions .",
    "although we have employed a lattice structure in the present work , our formalism can readily be applied to an assembly of randomly placed dipoles by considering a more complex basis in a unit cell .",
    "such an extension will be useful for the study of dielectric liquids under an intense electric field .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have applied the ewald - kornfeld formulation to a tetragonal lattice of point dipoles to examine the effects of geometric anisotropy on the local field distribution .",
    "the various problems encountered in the computation of the conditionally convergent summation are addressed and the methods of overcoming them are discussed .",
    "we suggest that the large value of the derivative of the local field with respect to the degree of anisotropy offers potential applications as artificial piezoelectric materials as one can change the degree of anisotropy easily in a suspension .",
