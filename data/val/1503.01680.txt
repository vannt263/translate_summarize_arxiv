    "disordered solids , namely various glasses , polymeric or not , exhibit , following fast relaxation after quench , a slow , usually quasi - logarithmic , mechanical strengthening . this self - decelarating behavior is known as aging .",
    "as pointed out by parker and normand@xcite , this specificity of glassy dynamics , commonly assigned to the complexity of the free energy landscape , is shared by another class of materials , namely thermoreversible hydrogels . indeed ,",
    "although their polymer content is in general very small ( typically a few percent ) , when they are quenched below the gelation temperature @xmath0 , as crosslinks proliferate beyond percolation , the corresponding topological constraints increasingly decimate the paths of easy relaxation .",
    "while logarithmic aging has been evidenced in numerous gels @xcite , extensive systematic studies have focussed on gelatin ones .",
    "gelatin consists of polypeptide chains which self - assemble , when quenched below @xmath1c , via partial renaturation of the native collagen triple - helix structure @xcite from the high temperature free chain coil configuration .",
    "the chirality of the resulting crosslinks ( cl ) permits to characterize this gelation dynamics by monitoring the evolution , not only of the storage shear modulus @xmath2 , but also the optical activity , hence the renatured collagen fraction @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement @xcite on the fact that gelation proceeds via the following scenario :    \\(i ) formation of triple - helix nuclei whose critical size decreases as temperature @xmath4 decreases below @xmath0 ;    \\(ii ) subsequent extension ( growth ) of these critical crosslinks while nucleation gradually slows down as the network mesh size decreases .",
    "the associated depletion of the entropy supply of the polymer chains leads to gradual exhaustion of these nucleation and growth processes , hence to a severe slowing down of the growth of @xmath2 .",
    "this is often described as `` saturation of the modulus '' , since many authors traditionally resort to the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plot an example of which is shown on fig.[fig : loglin ] ( insert ) . however , in this late regime , as illustrated on fig.[fig : loglin ] :    \\(iii ) structural relaxation does not stop but crosses over to the self - decelerating , logarithmic dynamics ( @xmath7 ) characteristic of glass aging . no trend toward saturation has been observed up to two months @xcite .    this aging behavior , specific of physical ( as opposed to covalent ) gels , has been assigned to network rearrangements taking place via thermally activated zippings and unzippings of the h - bonds stabilized triple helices , i.e. to the thermoreversibility of the cl .",
    "however , no direct information about the relative weight of nucleation / growth versus `` crosslink plasticity '' in the early and late regimes of network build - up has been available up to now . in order to try and shed more light on this issue , we resort in this work to an approach which parallels the study of point - to - set correlations in glass - forming liquids @xcite . that is , in order to assess the influence of reversibility on the dynamics , we introduce in the gels a controlled density of covalent cl .    more precisely , we first form at a temperature above @xmath0 a covalent network , characterized by its shear modulus @xmath8 .",
    "further covalent crosslinking is then inhibited , after which we quench the gel below @xmath0 so as to allow for physical crosslinking to take place .",
    "this leads to the formation of `` chemical - physical hybrid gels '' @xcite the aging dynamics of which we monitor via the evolution of their modulus @xmath9 and renatured collagen fraction @xmath10 .    as can be intuitively expected , increasing @xmath8 , hence the fraction of irreversible cl , results in a slower and slower dynamics .",
    "moreover , the qualitative features of @xmath10 and @xmath9  including non - saturating , logarithmic aging of the shear modulus  are fully preserved .",
    "detailed quantitative analysis of the dependence upon @xmath8 of network build - up dynamics enables us to identify a temperature - dependent cross - over shear modulus separating ( i ) an early nucleation regime during which crosslink rearrangements play a negligible role , from ( ii ) the late , logarithmic aging one , fully controlled by rearrangements .",
    "we discuss the implication of our results in terms of the switch from an early , local dynamics to a late , cooperative long - range one .",

    "type a from porcine skin , sigma ) in deionized water et 65@xmath11c .",
    "after total dissolution of the polymer , the solution is quickly mixed at 40@xmath11c with a tgase enzyme solution ( microbial transglutaminase , activa - wm , ajinomoto foods europe sas ) so as to reach a final composition of 5 wt% gelatin and 2.6 nmol of tgase ( corresponding to an enzymatic activity of 2u ) .",
    "the solution is poured into the measurement cells of both a rheometer and a polarimeter ( see below ) .",
    "gelation then proceeds at @xmath12c . at this temperature ,",
    "chosen well above @xmath13c , no triple - helix _ reversible _ cross - link can form whereas tgase catalyzes actively the formation of inter - chain _ covalent _ bonds between two specific residues @xcite .",
    "when the target shear modulus level , as monitored in the rheometer , is reached , the enzyme is inhibited by quickly heating both samples up to 70@xmath11c and staying at this temperature for 10 min , after which they are cooled down back to 40@xmath11c .",
    "we have checked that the shear modulus , measured at this temperature , remains constant over days .",
    "the physical gelation is subsequently triggered by quenching to the working temperature @xmath14  in most cases , @xmath15c .",

    "the sample is protected against solvent evaporation by a paraffin oil rim .",
    "we quench the samples at the maximum rate ( 15@xmath11c / min ) permitted by the thermoelectric cooling device so as to minimize the formation of physical crosslinks prior to reaching the target temperature @xmath4 .",
    "we will need to characterize the hybrid gels by the modulus of the purely covalent network at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "since physical gelation starts without any time - lag ( see below ) , it is not possible to measure reliably @xmath16 . since the gel elasticity is of entropic origin",
    ", the shear modulus at fixed network structure scales as the absolute temperature @xmath4 .",
    "so , as a proxy for @xmath16 , we use the following expression : @xmath17 with both temperatures in @xmath11k .    all the gels studied here exhibit a very small level of viscoelastic losses ( typically the ratio of the loss to storage moduli , @xmath18 at 1 hz ) .",
    "so , for the sake of simplicity we characterize them by their sole storage shear modulus , noted @xmath2 .",

    "the renatured collagen fraction @xmath3 is obtained as @xcite : @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the rotation angle measured in the coil state above @xmath0 and extrapolated down to @xmath4 according to @xcite , and @xmath22 is the rotation angle of a 1 cm - thick , 5 wt.% collagen sample @xcite .",
    "the sample cell is thermalized by a water circulating circuit .",
    "quenching is achieved by switching the circulating water between two different temperature - controlled baths .",
    "although the total duration of the quench is comparable to the one achieved in the rheometer , it is impossible to match precisely the shapes of the transients , the initial cooling rate being faster in the polarimeter . in the following",
    "we will chose the time origin for physical gelation as the instant at which the sample temperature reaches the target one @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : allgchi ] shows the time evolution of the shear modulus @xmath2 and helix fraction @xmath3 for values of the modulus of the covalent network at the working temperature @xmath15c , increasing from @xmath23 ( purely physical gel ) to @xmath24 pa . the semi - logarithmic representation ( fig.[fig : allgchi].a )",
    "reveals that the evolution of @xmath2 is qualitatively preserved in the presence of covalent cl .",
    "in particular , late quasi - logarithmic aging is observed for all values of @xmath8 , no trend to saturation being observable up to @xmath25 s.    the early evolution of the modulus is best displayed by plotting the increment @xmath26 of its value from that immediately after quench .",
    "the most conspicuous feature of the corresponding plot ( fig.[fig : gzoom ] ) consists of the initial behavior of @xmath26 : while the purely physical gel exhibits a finite delay before the emergence of a measurable modulus , for all hybrid gels , however small @xmath27 , the initial rate of growth of @xmath26 is finite , decreasing as @xmath8 increases .",
    "the origin of this discontinuous behavior is clear : while , in the purely physical gel case , percolation of the triple - helix cl has to be reached for a finite @xmath2 to emerge , in the presence of a preexisting percolating covalent network , physical cl formation is immediately revealed .",
    "this leads us to an important inference , namely a fraction at least of the triple - helix cl involve polymer strands belonging to the covalent network .",
    "this proves that our hybrid gels _ do not _ consist ( as is the case of `` double network '' ones @xcite ) of two interpenetrating but independent networks of different natures  which would contribute additively to @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the decrease of the initial slope indicates that covalent interchain bonds do not act as inhomogeneous nucleation centers for triple helix formation .",
    "the evolution of the helix fraction @xmath3 is shown on fig.[fig : allgchi].b . here again the hindering effect of covalent cl translates into the gradual slowing - down of the dynamics with increasing cl density . unlike @xmath2 , the optical activity of the purely physical gel does not exhibit any latency since it is insensitive to the connectivity of the polymer chain system .    beyond these general remarks we need to define a procedure to compare modulus build - up in our various gels .",
    "we choose to proceed as follows : we first measure the time @xmath28 for which the modulus of the purely physical gel @xmath29 reaches the value @xmath8 , then we shift the @xmath30 curve of the corresponding hybrid gel by @xmath28 along the time axis .    the rationale for this choice is the following .",
    "a purely physical gel and a chemical one exhibit distinct network topologies , since triple - helix cl are spatially extended , involving three chains , while the pointlike covalent ones connect two chains only . however , as gel elasticity is of purely entropic origin , @xmath2 is controlled by the entropy reduction of the polymer chain system due to crosslinking , hence is an indicator of the density of degrees of freedom which are frozen at the corresponding stage of gelation @xcite .",
    "so , our procedure amounts to choosing for the common reference the situation where the density of degrees of freedom which remain available for further evolution for both gels is comparable .",
    "the resulting plot ( fig.[fig : shiftg ] ) exhibits a striking structure .",
    "namely , up to a modulus level @xmath31 lying in the 700800 pa range , the hybrid gel data corresponding to @xmath32 closely bunch with @xmath29 . beyond this",
    ", they separate from @xmath33 and bend sharply into a splayed set of quasi log - linear curves . for @xmath34",
    ", separation occurs for @xmath35 values which decreases rapidly with @xmath8 .              the bunching of the @xmath2 curves ( fig.[fig : shiftg ] ) suggests that , in this regime , it is the total gel modulus which codes the network evolution .",
    "if such is the case , other characteristics of the network should exhibit a change of regime at a the crossover value comparable to @xmath31 .",
    "a natural candidate for checking this proposition is the helix fraction @xmath3 which we therefore plot , in the `` master curve '' representation of joly - duhamel et al .",
    "@xcite , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "fig.[fig : chig].a shows the corresponding plot for a purely physical gel at @xmath15c .",
    "the finite @xmath36 value measures the helix fraction at percolation . at the modulus value",
    "noted @xmath37 pa , @xmath38 crosses over from a linear regime to a markedly sublinear one .",
    "the same analysis of the hybrid gel data for @xmath8 values up to 750 pa reveals , as illustrated on fig.[fig : chig].b , the persistence of a low-@xmath2 linear regime terminating at @xmath39 .",
    "we find ( see insert of fig.[fig : chig].b ) that @xmath40 does not exhibit any significant dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "the mean ( @xmath41 std",
    ". dev . ) : @xmath42 pa is fully compatible with the crossover level @xmath31 previously identified from the bunching of the @xmath9 data ( see fig.[fig : shiftg ] )",
    ". moreover , the @xmath40 crossover turns out ( fig.[fig : loglin ] ) to lie very close to the emergence of the logarithmic aging regime . in order to check the robustness of these features with respect to temperature",
    "we have performed the same analysis on physical gels of the same composition , quenched at @xmath43 and @xmath44c . as is well known , the smaller @xmath4",
    ", the faster the gelation dynamics .",
    "the shape of the @xmath38 curves is preserved while @xmath45 increases as @xmath4 decreases  its values , reported in table [ tab : moduli ] , remaining in the close vicinity of the entry into the log stage ( see fig.[fig : troistemp ] ) .",
    "these results bring strong support to our above assumption of the existence of an early regime , the development and termination of which are coded by the total elastic modulus , i.e. are quasi - insensitive to network topology and crosslink reversibility .",
    "moreover , the quasi - linearity of the early @xmath38 dependence suggests a simple , qualitative interpretation , namely : according to the entropic origin of gel elasticity , it is commonly admitted @xcite that , as a first approximation , the shear modulus scales as the cl density . during physical gelation ,",
    "only triple helix cl are formed .",
    "so , on the same level of approximation , we may write for the variations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 induced by an increment @xmath46 of cl density : @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 the average triple - helix cl length . from this",
    ", @xmath50 cst immediately translates into the statement that @xmath49 remains stationary over the early gelation regime .",
    "note that this assertion agrees with the conclusion reached by guo et al @xcite who were able to deduce , from the evolution of @xmath3 upon remelting physical gels of various ages , the distribution of lengths of these rods at various stages of gelation .",
    "they found that it remains quasi invariant in the corresponding time regime ( while @xmath49 slowly drifts , at later times , toward larger values ) .",
    "one step further , in agreement with nucleation theory @xcite , we can expect the critical nucleus size , hence @xmath49 to diverge upon approaching the gelation temperature @xmath0 . since , from our above remarks , @xmath51 , we have plotted @xmath52 vs. @xmath53 .",
    "we find that our data for @xmath54c extrapolate linearly to the origin ( see insert of fig.[fig : chig].a ) , indicating the expected @xmath55 divergence .",
    "this regime is characterized by the logarithmic increase with time of the shear modulus which emerges close above the crossover level @xmath31 defined on fig.[fig : shiftg ] . as already mentioned , the logarithmic slope : @xmath56 is markedly dependent upon @xmath8 , i.e. on the density of irreversible cl .",
    "fig.[fig : pentes ] displays the values of @xmath57 measured at @xmath58c for various hybrid gels with @xmath8 ranging from 20 to 1600 pa .",
    "these data are very nicely fitted by the expression @xmath59\\ ] ] with @xmath60 pa .",
    "note that the extrapolated slope @xmath61 pa / decade lies noticeably below the value ( 630 pa , see black dot on fig.[fig : pentes ] ) for the purely physical gel .",
    "this is attributable to the fact that , while the physical gel does not contain any irreversible cl , a hybrid gel with vanishingly small @xmath8 presents the finite density of covalent cl corresponding to the percolation threshold of the chemical network . the above exponential decay is robust with respect to temperature variations as shown on the insert of fig.[fig : pentes ] , which reports data obtained at @xmath62 and @xmath63c .",
    "this behavior brings to light the existence of a characteristic modulus @xmath64 associated with logarithmic aging .",
    "we notice that its variation with @xmath4 parallels that of the crossover modulus while its values remain systematically smaller than @xmath65 ( see table [ tab : moduli ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : troistemp ] ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the existence of two dynamical regimes during the build - up of the physical network , which can be clearly differentiated according to their sensitivity to the nature of crosslinks .    while covalent cl are irreversible , physical ones undergo `` rearrangements '' via elementary , thermally activated zipping or unzipping events through which helix segments may either grow , shrink or slide by coherent zipping / unzipping at both ends .",
    "the clock is set for these fluctuations by the cis - trans isomerisation of ( pro - gly - pro ) sequences of amino acid residues @xcite .",
    "as the corresponding mean flip time lies in the 10100 s range at @xmath66 , we are dealing here with very slow processes .",
    "rearrangements occur via the biasing of fluctuations under the effect of tension forces along the coil segments which connect the cl .    in the early regime ,",
    "the evolutions of both the stiffness and the helix fraction are found to be coded by the instantaneous value of the modulus and essentially insensitive to the presence of covalent bonds .",
    "this implies that the time scale for the nucleation of triple helices is small enough for rearrangements to be quasi - frozen , hence the insensitivity to the ( reversible or not ) nature of the cl .",
    "of course , the larger @xmath2 , the shorter the mesh size hence the thinner the entropic supply available for further nucleation the rate of which thus decreases  so much so that rearrangement dynamics finally takes over .",
    "this results in a rather sharp switch , about a crossover modulus @xmath31 .",
    "the emerging late regime is characterized by the logarithmic growth of @xmath9 together with a markedly sublinear @xmath38  which indicates that less and less new helix length is required for further stiffening of the network . moreover , and most important , the aging dynamics dramatically slows down as the density of irreversible cl increases .",
    "all these features are consistent with a dynamics controlled by cl rearrangements .    loosely speaking we may distinguish between two types of such processes , which we refer to as _",
    "local _ and _ collective_. we define as a local process the length evolution of a triple helix segment in the frozen environment determined by its non - evolving nearest neighboring cl . due to the finite , nanometric , size of the gel mesh ,",
    "the relaxation time for such a process is clearly finite . a simple model of the helix - coil transition on a single polymer strand with fixed ends @xcite and with a fokker - planck dynamics @xcite for the helix length evolution yields a linear dependence of the relaxation time on the number of monomers in the strand @xcite . explaining the late dynamics by the `` local '' growth of triple helices nucleated in the early stage would demand a flat distribution of relaxation times spanning more than the 3 decades over which logarithmic aging has been observed , hence a completely unrealistic flat ( gaussian ) strand end - to - end distance distribution spanning at least 1.5 decades .",
    "we are therefore led to conclude that the aging behavior results from dynamical interactions between crosslinks , which we call collective processes . more precisely : an elementary ( un)zipping event affecting a physical cl induces variations of the tensions of emerging strands , i.e. acts as a localized force dipole acting on the surrounding elastic medium .",
    "this gives rise quasi - instantaneously ( i.e. with a delay set by sound propagation ) to a power law decreasing strain field which , in turn , modifies the tensions of strands involved in remote cls , thereby displacing their equilibrium triple helix length .",
    "due to the long range of elastic couplings , this results in a broadband mechanical noise . as global relaxation ,",
    "i.e. collagen renaturation , proceeds , one expects that further modulus growth requires cooperation between an increasingly large number of physical cl , hence involves a growing correlated volume and , accordingly , a growing time scale .",
    "in such a picture , introducing an increasing fraction of irreversible cl has a multiple effect . on the one hand , for a given @xmath2",
    "it reduces the fraction of rearrangeable cls . on the other hand , the average distance between the latter increases , and so does the mechanical noise amplitude . moreover , covalent bonds restrict the amplitude of triple helix sliding due to coherent zipping / unzipping at both ends .",
    "we saw that as time lapses in the late regime , modulus increase involves less and less helix length creation .",
    "this is a strong hint of the increasing role played by length preserving correlated sliding processes , which are destroyed by the interposition of covalent bonds on chains connecting the two helix segments .",
    "this topological effect of chemical bonds thus results in the decimation of the possible relaxation paths in configuration space .    at this stage ,",
    "pending the development of a theory relating logarithmic aging to definite characteristics of structural evolution , it remains out of the scope of the present work to explain on the basis of these qualitative remarks the observed dependence of the aging dynamics of hybrid gels on their chemical modulus @xmath8 .",
    "progress toward this goal would certainly highly benefit from the development of numerical modeling , possibly in the spirit of the investigations of long time scale glass aging currently developed by several groups @xcite .",
    "this might shed light on an issue of broader interest , namely whether or not stiffening during aging is associated with decreasing elastic non - affinity , i.e. whether slow relaxation drives the system toward gradual homogenization of the internal stresses        a. parker and v. normand , soft matter * 6 * , 4916 ( 2010 ) k. te nijenhuis , _ thermoreversible networks : viscoelastic properties and structure of gels _ , adv .",
