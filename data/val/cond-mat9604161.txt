    "in spite of intense research activity to determine precisely the laws for the behavior of charge and current distributions in samples undergoing the qhe , there remains many interesting questions to be answered , and experimental results constantly add new aspects to the subject .",
    "see for example  @xcite-@xcite .    during early activity in the field ,  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    "static effective equations for the electric and magnetic fields were obtained .",
    "already , at that time , there were predictions that the fields would be localized on the boundaries .",
    "recently experiments have observed this phenomenom in small mesoscopic samples  @xcite . also in @xcite in addition , it was pointed out that the magnetic field should contribute to the charge density .",
    "this follows simply from charge conservation .",
    "these kinds of density distributions are essential ingredients of the chern - simons approach proposed early in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . at that time ,",
    "however , the relevance of the 3d character of the electromagnetic field was not appreciated . because of this , the merits of the cs approach were not fully realized . to clarify the way in which the cs action is relevant for the qhe it was argued in  @xcite that discussions in  @xcite-@xcite",
    "could also be considered as being described by the cs action .",
    "simply , this action describes in the euler equations for an electromagnetic field , the response of a medium showing linear hall conductivity .",
    "in addition it was argued that the purely 2d chern - simons discussion , with its predictions of meissner effect and a massive photon , could be realized in semiconductor superlattices . the case of time dependent fields",
    "was also considered in that work .",
    "more recently , the importance of the chern - simons action for the explanation of the electromagnetic response , also emerged from the side of the anyonic and composite fermion approaches for the qhe  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite . using the microscopic composite fermion approach effective electromagnetic equations",
    "were derived in @xcite , that resembled the previous results of  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this discussion in [ 1 ] supported the conclusions of the former approach  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite by again stressing the role cs ( hall ) currents .",
    "these currents while concentrated near the border are different from the purely edge currents that flow very much closer to it",
    ". this fact does not invalidate the buttiker picture because both currents are closely linked by gauge invariance  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the dynamical predictions of the effective maxwell equations obtained in  @xcite in connection with the existence of surface waves in planar samples .",
    "defining experimental criteria for the detection of these waves or other dynamical responses for the 2deg could be helpful in determining the precise effective electromagnetic equations for qhe samples .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 the set of maxwell equations given in  @xcite",
    "are reviewed and a simple argument is given showing that the cs action is all that is needed for a lagrangean description of a medium having charge conserving hall currents .",
    "section 3 is devoted to solving the equations for surface waves .",
    "the dispersion relations and wave polarizations are explicitly found .",
    "only one of the solutions corresponds to a proper surface wave .",
    "the dispersion relation for the range of wavevectors and frequencies in which the equations were obtained is almost linear , with a propagation velocity coinciding with the light velocity in the surrounding dielectric medium . for wavevectors and frequencies in the above mentioned region ,",
    "that is @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the magnetic length and the cyclotronic frequency respectively ) , the standard size of present experimental samples ( @xmath3 ) is very much greater than the infrared optical wavelength associated with the cyclotronic frequency at the usual values of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it seems possible that the infinite plane approximation considered here can be satisfied in real experimental situations .",
    "another kind of solution also follows . it can be interpreted as corresponding to forced oscillations of the 2deg due charge and current densities in the near regions .",
    "the dispersion relation in this case shows a gap for the spatial wavevector q below which real solutions for the frequency do not exist . for low frequencies ,",
    "the wavevector turns out to be almost independent of frequency and varies only with the magnetic field .",
    "for typical values of the field , the associated wavelength is of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "these properties of the forced oscillations motivated us to use these solution to construct a model for describing special resonances recently found in experiments  @xcite . in section 4",
    "the model is discussed . in these experiments",
    "@xcite qhe samples were prepaired having gate surfaces that covered a portion of the sample as well as a section of the edge . after imposing a positive gate voltage , a metallic region ( which they called the `` puddle '' )",
    "was created inside the bulk area .",
    "results show the appearance of well defined and equally spaced conductance resonances when the capacitance is measured as a function of increasing gate voltage .",
    "it was estimated that the puddle region during these resonances was separated from the edge zone by an incompressible strip ( is ) in the qhe regime having a width of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity is of the same order as the wavelength of the above discussed forced oscillations .",
    "the varying gate voltage can also be imagined as controlling the width of the incompressible strip .",
    "in addition , the capacitance was measured at nonzero frequency by applying an ac voltage to the gate .",
    "the proposed model assumes that these resonances are related to the generation of forced oscillations by the ac electric fields at values of the gate voltage where the width of the is equals an integer number of halfs of the characteristic wavelength . after selecting fitting parameters chosen for a specific value of the magnetic field , the dependence of the resonance maxima on the magnetic field value matches qualitatively the experimental data .",
    "a closer investigation of the consistence of this model will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "maxwell s equations for the 4-vector potential @xmath6 describing small time dependent electromagnetic perturbations of the constant magnetic field @xmath7 in a planar sample for the qhe regime were obtained previously  @xcite . for our problem , these equations take the formm , @xmath8 + where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a kind of dielectric tensor , @xmath11 is a projection operator tensor on the 2deg plane , @xmath12 is the 4-velocity of the same plane and @xmath13 , is a unit 4-vector being normal to the plane .",
    "these quantities take the explicit forms ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the medium where the 2deg is embedded . for usual experimental situations ,",
    "this quantity is a number of the order of ten . in reference",
    "@xcite , these equations were obtained for the vacuum case , that is @xmath16 . however , here we are trying to describe more realistic situations that appear in mesoscopic systems .",
    "this requires inclusion of the dielectric properties of the surrounding medium for the 2deg .",
    "these equations correspond to the following generalization of the lorentz gauge for the 4-vector potential @xmath17    which as usual does not fully fix .",
    "this allows us to impose in addition the axial gauge @xmath18    equations ( 1 ) were obtained by performing a one loop calculation of the dielectric tensor of the 2deg placed in a magnetic field @xmath7 for densities corresponding to the complete filling of @xmath19 landau levels . only a local approximation was considered in which long wavelength @xmath20 and low frequency @xmath21 conditions were assumed .",
    "the terms in the second line of ( 1 ) represent chern - simons sources which are equivalent to the hall conductivity current and density of the system .",
    "the third line of ( 1 ) is the 4-current associated with the dielectric properties of the electron gas in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the associated parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath24    note that the dielectric polarizability @xmath23 is inversely proportional to the magnetic field . in ( 5 ) , the mass parameter is assumed to take the typical value for the effective mass for electrons in the asga samples equal to @xmath25 of the electron mass . as defined above",
    ", b is the external magnetic field which is of the order of @xmath26 tesla in current experimental conditions .",
    "the static limit of equation ( 1 ) reproduce many of the features of the discussion of  @xcite and @xcite , but in addition includes a complementary magnetic field dependent charge density .",
    "this term was discussed for the first time @xcite as arising from the requirement of charge conservation . in the context of our previous work @xcite",
    ", botth approaches are contained within equations based on a chern - simons action that generates hall currents as well as magnetic field dependent charges , and where the electromagnetic fields are considered in 3d space .",
    "the set of equations ( 1 ) can be translated into a more physically appealing representation by expressing them in terms of the electric and magnetic field intensities @xmath27    using these relations and the gauge conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for to eliminate the @xmath6 components from the maxwell equations ( 1 ) , the equations can be written in the following form    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the projector on the 2deg diadic 3d - tensor and @xmath30 is a unit vector normal to the plane .    equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are analogues of the vacuum equations for faraday induction and the absence of magnetic charge .",
    "in addition in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , the @xmath23 dependent terms show that the electron gas behaves as a dielectric surface which polarizes itself linearly only due to the tangential components of the electric field .",
    "the hall currents appear now explicitly in the r.h.s . of ( 8) .",
    "the only unusual contribution is the magnetic field dependent charge density appearing in the r.h.s . of ( 7 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , an discussed in  @xcite this term arises from the general condition of charge conservation .",
    "therefore , its presence should not be considered as an unusual outcome .",
    "rather , such charge densities are determined by assuming the existence of a hall conductivity in a planar medium .",
    "this fact will be discussed below .    in the set of equations ( 7)-(10 )",
    ", the magnetic field charge density is substituted by a undefined function @xmath31 .",
    "all the other terms remain unaltered . after taking the divergence of equation ( 8) , and adding the result to equation ( 7 ) the following conservation conditions follow for the polarization and for the hall currents and densities @xmath32    after substituting in ( 11 ) the expression for the hall currents",
    ", it follows that @xmath33    this relation shows that the unknown quantity @xmath34 should differ by a time independent function from the magnetic field dependent charge density that appears in eq .",
    "( 7 ) . then , after assuming that before any perturbations ( by , for example , incoming waves ) the charge densities vanished , it follows that the magnetic field dependent surface charge densities ( and then the whole chern - simons structure of the hall current 4-vector ) is implied by the existence of a hall conductivity .",
    "these are the basic equations to be used to investigate the spectrum of surface waves and forced oscillations for the 2deg in the integral qhe regime .",
    "we look for solutions of the maxwell equations ( 1 ) that have harmonic behavior corresponding to the propagation of energy along the plane .",
    "to be specific , we consider the propagation along the direction @xmath35 of the coordinate axes .",
    "oscillatory solutions showing an exponential decay away from the @xmath36 axis will correspond to surface waves and ones that grow outside the plane should describe forced oscillations driven by currents and charges at some boundary .",
    "the vector potential will take the form    @xmath37,\\ ] ]    where the wavevector component along the @xmath35 axis will be designed as @xmath38    and all the wavevector components @xmath39 and @xmath40 are chosen to satisfy the wave equation in the surrounding dielectric medium .",
    "that is , they obey @xmath41    relation ( 14 ) allows us to write an expression for the wavevector component @xmath42 , which controls the behavior of the fields outside the plane , @xmath43    where the positive value for the squared root is taken when its argument is positive . then , the factor f can have two values @xmath44    for @xmath45 or @xmath46 , the wave amplitude decreases or grows when away from the surface .",
    "determination of the solution is simplified by considering the first term in the maxwell equation ( 1 ) after substituting the expression ( 13 ) for @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath6 satisfies the wave equation in a dielectric medium , the result reduces to a surface contribution on the following form @xmath47    therefore , the set ( 1 ) becomes a matrix equation over the 2deg plane for the nonvanishing polarization components @xmath48 .",
    "it can be written in the form @xmath49    where @xmath50 is @xmath51    after imposing the condition that the determinant of the matrix should vanish , the following dispersion relations arise @xmath52    from these , it can be seen that the cases @xmath45 and @xmath46 correspond to the positive and negative values of the squared root respectively .",
    "then , two possibilities appear : surface wave propagation given by f=1 and forced oscillations given by f=-1 .",
    "the vector potential polarization vectors can be written in the following way    @xmath53   \\cr     k_o     \\cr     0     \\cr    - q/ { ( i\\,\\epsilon_d ) } \\cr   } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : 21 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    below , physical conditions for the validity of these solutions will be discussed in each of the cases : the surface waves and the forced oscillations      the set of maxwell equations ( 1 ) was obtained using the local approximation where the wavevector of the perturbations @xmath6 was assumed to satisfy @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the magnetic radius and the cyclotronic frequency",
    "have the usual expressions @xmath56 and @xmath57    therefore , eventhough the dispersion relation is nonlinear , in the region of validity for the approximations , the dependence is nearly linear in behavior .",
    "the velocity of the waves in this low momentum zone coincides with the light velocity in the surrounding dielectric medium .",
    "the general form of the dispersion curve is shown in fig . 1 by the branch crossing the origin .",
    "the whole curve gives the surface wave dispersion for a classical problem characterized by planar hall conductivity and dielectric responses .",
    "however , application to the case of a realistic 2deg in the qhe regime reduces to a narrow region where @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "let us assume that the wavevectors obey these conditions , and discuss the connection with the experimental situation .",
    "the limitations imposed by @xmath61 are not very strong because the normal values for @xmath62 in present experiments are of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , up to optical wavelengths this approximation is well satisfied .",
    "the more restrictive bound comes from the frequency relation @xmath64 . in this case , after considering typical values for the magnetic field foundin experiments @xmath65 , the cyclotronic frequency is of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the dispersion relations are expected to hold up to the infrared region .    in connection with the possibilities for detection of such waves under present laboratory conditions , it should be noted that the above bounds on the frequency are related to wavelengths @xmath67 for @xmath60 .",
    "these values are much smaller than the normal sample sizes which can presently be prepared .",
    "therefore , in this sense , the present analysis favors the possibility of the generation and detection of such waves .",
    "clearly , the stability of the present picture under boundary effects present in real mesoscopic samples should be considered in more detail .",
    "the case f=-1 corresponds to oscillations which grow in the @xmath36 directions away from the 2deg plane .",
    "let us consider two planar surfaces parallel to the @xmath36 plane and at the same distances , say @xmath68 from it .",
    "consider also , choosing the solutions outside these planes to be equal to the corresponding ones inside the planes but substituting @xmath69 .",
    "the special surface current and charge density distributions on these planes that allow such a global solutions , can be calculated by applying the wave equation .",
    "this picture allows to understand the forced nature of the oscillations .",
    "it also suggests that neighboring structures in mesoscopic systems can act as generators which force this resonant behavior .",
    "the dispersion curve associated with forced oscillations is ilustrated in fig . 1 by the curve not intersecting the origin of the coordinate axes .",
    "the result shows the existence of a critical value for the spatial momentum @xmath70 below which real solutions for frequency are absent .",
    "in fact , as in the surface wave case , for the 2deg experimental samples , the curve are only valid for frequencies smaller than @xmath71 . in this region , the wavelength of the waves are almost frequency independent . in terms of the dimensionless units used in fig.1 , this region corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "the critical wavelength for the forced oscillations is inversely depending on the magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "its value for normal experimental conditions @xmath73 and @xmath74 is as small as @xmath75 . the properties for such solutions ledd us to suspect taht they are relevant for describing recent experiments ( @xcite ) in which special tunneling resonances were reported .    in the next section , a model for the explanation of these resonances based on these forced oscillations",
    "will be proposed .",
    "in reference  @xcite , the authors reported experiments done on qhe samples in which a gate surface covered part of the bulk as well as part of the edge . after applying a positive gate voltage ,",
    "a metallic region ( the `` puddle '' ) was created inside the bulk .",
    "it was composed of electrons excited to the partially filled next landau level by the attracting gate voltage .",
    "the capacitance between the gate and the edge contacts was measured as a function of the applied gate voltage for a range of values of the frequency and the magnetic field .",
    "the results show the appearance of equally spaced resonances when the gate voltage was increased .",
    "it has been estimated that the puddle region should be separated from the edge by an incompressible strip ( is ) in the qhe regime having a width of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "a reasonable phenomenological model used by the authors indicates that these resonances are associated with resonant tunneling currents passing across the is .    below , we give arguments suggesting that the forced oscillations discussed in last section are candidates for producing these resonances .",
    "the reasoning goes as follows . as noticed before",
    ", the low frequency spectrum of forced oscillations is characterized by a constant wavelength which is given by @xmath77    in experiments the is is subject to a time varying voltage which is applied to measure the capacitance .",
    "the spatially inhomogeneous form of this potential can be considered as the source for the external charges which necessary for the forced oscillations to be excited .",
    "we consider now the following assumptions :    1 ) .",
    "the is only resonates when its length l coincides with an integer number of half wavelength of the forced wave .",
    "\\2 ) the odd symmetry of the applied potential with respect to the center of the plate restricts the the resonating condition requiring the length l to correspond to an odd number of halfs wavelength .",
    "\\3 ) increasing the gate voltages reduces the width l of the is , with the various resonances being produced according to the previous rules .",
    "the main elements elements considered within the model are ilustrated in fig .",
    "2 .    under the above suppositions , we can write the condition which links the length of the strip with the magnetic field as follows @xmath78    however , the experimental data  @xcite are given in terms of the dependence of the resonances on the gate voltage @xmath79 .",
    "thus , in order to compare the consequences of the model with experiment , it is convenient to estimate the functional link between the length l of the is and the gate voltage @xmath79 , by fitting some experimental data .",
    "for this purpose , we assume a linear relationship between @xmath80 and @xmath79 as @xmath81    where @xmath82 will also be fixed by estimating the voltage @xmath79 at which the puddle joints with the edge .    taking the voltage shift between resonances as equal to @xmath83  @xcite , the parameter @xmath84 is given by    @xmath85    restricting to the first landau level @xmath86 , the voltage @xmath87 can be evaluated from fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite to be approximately @xmath88    next , we defined a function of the variable @xmath89 to be a sum of six gaussian functions having maxima at each integral value of @xmath90 .",
    "the variable @xmath91 is expressed in terms of the magnetic field @xmath7 and the gate voltage @xmath79 by using ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) in order to investigate the behavior of this function of @xmath79 as the magnetic field is varied .",
    "the result is shown in fig . 3 and reproduces qualitatively the data of fig . 2 in  @xcite .",
    "the most interesting fact is that the slopes for the dependence of the maxima on the magnetic field match .",
    "the fitting parameters taken from the experiment were the voltage separation between resonances at the value of @xmath92 and the voltage @xmath93 for the disappearance of the incompressible strip at the same field value .",
    "the description of the slopes is a prediction of the model which introduces a dependence of the wavelength on the magnetic field that qualitatively agrees with the experiment .",
    "it can also be added that the proposed approach naturally explains the global character of the resonances which appear for various sizes of the gate electrode . in future work , a derivation of the main assumptions adopted above will be studied .",
    "one of the authors ( a.c . ) greatly acknowledge the support of the high energy section of the ictp for a visit which was central in allowing to perform this work and to link it with recent experimental activity on the subject and also greatly appreciate the invitation of the condensed matter section to participate in the very helpful adriatico research conference on : `` the electron quantum liquid in systems of reduced dimensions''(2 - 5 july 1996 ) . the remarks and help of e. tosatti , j. lawson , g. ernst and a.h .",
