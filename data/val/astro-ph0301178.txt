    "clusters of galaxies are the largest relaxed structures in the universe .",
    "they were initially discovered in optical observations , where clusters appear as concentrations containing @xmath4 bright galaxies and @xmath5 faint galaxies in a region which is typically @xmath6 mpc in radius ( 1 megaparsec @xmath7 cm ) @xcite .",
    "for example , figure  ( [ fig : fig1 ] , left panel ) shows the optical image of the central region of the nearby coma cluster showing many galaxies . in their central regions ,",
    "clusters are about @xmath8 times denser than the average of material in the universe .",
    "clusters of galaxies are very important cosmological probes @xcite .",
    "essentially , they are the only objects in the universe are both small enough to have achieved dynamical equilibrium during the age of the universe , and large enough to contain a fair sample of the material in the universe ( e.g. , the average ratio of baryonic to dark matter ) .",
    "although they were first observed as collections of galaxies , the dominant form of matter which has been observed in clusters of galaxies is hot diffuse plasma @xcite .",
    "this intracluster medium ( icm ) has typical temperatures of @xmath9 k and typical electron number densities of @xmath1 @xmath2 . at these temperatures ,",
    "the dominant form of radiation from a plasma is x - ray emission , mainly from thermal bremsstrahlung but also from collisionally excited line emission . as a result ,",
    "clusters of galaxies are generally very luminous x - ray emitters , with luminosities of @xmath3 ergs s@xmath10 .",
    "clusters are second only to quasars as the most luminous x - ray sources in the universe . for example , figure  ( [ fig : fig1 ] , right panel ) shows the x - ray image of the same central region of the coma cluster as the left panel .",
    "although the icm is diffuse , it fills all of the volume between and within the galaxies in clusters , and as a result its mass is large .",
    "the total mass of hot plasma in a cluster is typically @xmath11 , where @xmath12 g is the mass of the sun . in large clusters ,",
    "the total mass of hot gas exceeds the mass of all the stars and galaxies by a factor of @xmath135 .",
    "hot intracluster plasma is the dominant form of baryonic matter in clusters . in general",
    ", we now believe that most of the baryonic matter in the low redshift universe is in the form of hot intergalactic plasma .",
    "the mean free paths of electrons and ions in a plasma without a magnetic field are determined by coulomb collisions .",
    "the mean free path of electrons ( which is nearly the same as that protons ) is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electron number density , the coulomb logarithm @xmath16 , and 1 kpc @xmath17 cm .",
    "this is about 1% of the radius of a cluster , which suggests that the intracluster plasma can be treated as a fluid .",
    "the gyroradii in the intracluster magnetic field are much smaller than this ( sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetic ] ) .",
    "the timescale for coulomb collisions between electrons to bring them into kinetic equilibrium ( an isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution ) is about @xcite @xmath18 the time scale for protons to equilibrate among themselves is @xmath19 @xmath20 or roughly 43 times longer than the value in equation  ( [ eq : tee ] ) .",
    "similarly , time scale for the electrons and ions to reach equipartition ( equal temperatures ) is @xmath21 , or roughly 1870 times the value in equation  ( [ eq : tee ] ) .",
    "all of these are shorter than the typical ages of clusters of @xmath22 yr .",
    "thus , the intracluster plasma can generally be characterized by a maxwellian distribution at a kinetic temperature @xmath23 . because the radiation field is much more diffuse than a blackbody at the kinetic temperature , the gas if far from thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of the populations of excited levels of ions and the ionization state . however , the gas is in `` coronal equilibrium '' ; most bound electrons are in their ground levels , they are in excitation equilibrium , and the gas is in ionization equilibrium .",
    "the sound crossing time for a cluster is @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the diameter of the cluster , and @xmath26 is the sound speed .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the likely ages of clusters , so unless they are being disturbed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mergers ] ) , the gas should be nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium . for a spherical cluster in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the gas distribution is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total cluster mass within a radius @xmath29 .",
    "the gas pressure in the icm is given by the ideal gas law , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mass density in the gas , and @xmath32 gives the mean mass per particle .",
    "one often assumes that magnetic forces , pressure from relativistic particles , and other forces are relatively weak in clusters , although it is not certain that this is correct ( sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetic ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : hystatic ] ) has been used to determine the total masses or total density profiles of clusters by solving for @xmath33 .",
    "the temperature of the icm can be determined from observations of the x - ray spectrum of the gas , while the x - ray surface brightness can easily be de - projected to give the gas density .",
    "such measurements indicate that the total masses of large clusters are about @xmath34 , which considerably exceed the total mass of all of the intracluster gas and of all the galaxies combined . as such",
    ", clusters provide some of the strongest evidence for the domination of ( probably nonbaryonic ) dark matter on large scales in the universe . in a typical large cluster",
    ", @xmath1316% of the mass is in hot icm , @xmath133% of the mass is in stars and galaxies , and @xmath1381% of the mass appears to be dark matter .    as is true of most materials in the universe , the icm consists primarily of ionized hydrogen ( @xmath35% of mass ) and helium ( @xmath36% of mass ) .",
    "however , the icm does contain a significant amount of the common heavier elements ( o , fe , etc . ;",
    "@xmath37% of mass ) .",
    "this fraction is only about a factor of 23 times smaller than the fraction in the sun .",
    "many of these heavy elements are detected through x - ray lines observed in the spectra of clusters of galaxies ; these lines occur because the heavier elements are not quite completely ionized , even at the high temperatures in clusters .",
    "because most of the baryonic matter in clusters is in the icm , it turns out that most of the heavy elements are actually located there as well .",
    "hydrogen and helium are formed in the big bang , but the only source of the common heavier elements is fusion reactions in the centers of stars . at present , the only significant populations of stars are located in galaxies .",
    "the dispersal of heavy element into the diffuse intracluster gas required that stars in galaxies be disrupted by supernova explosions , and that the enriched gas escape the gravity of the galaxy in which the stars are located .",
    "detailed models for the chemical evolution of the icm suggest that about 25% of the gas originated in stars in galaxies , and that the remaining 75% came from primordial intergalactic gas . because there is presently about five times as much mass in the icm as in stars and galaxies",
    ", this requires that the galaxies located in clusters lost significant amounts of their baryonic content . at present",
    ", the galactic population in clusters of galaxies consists mainly of elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies , which have only low mass stars which do not produce a high rate of supernovae . to explain the large amounts of heavy elements in the icm",
    ", these galaxies must have had much higher rates of star formation and supernovae at earlier times , possibly associated with the formation of the galaxies .",
    "initially , the very high temperature ( @xmath38 k ) of the icm might seem surprising . however , this is one feature of clusters which is easily understood .",
    "clusters of galaxies contain enormous masses of material , and have very deep gravitational potential wells .",
    "almost any natural process which introduces gas into clusters will cause it to move very rapidly and be shock - heated to roughly the observed temperature .",
    "for example , if the icm fell into clusters , it would be accelerated to roughly the escape speed from clusters , which is @xmath39 km / s .",
    "a portion of the icm may have been ejected from galaxies ; galaxies in clusters move on random orbits with velocities of @xmath40 km / s . in either case , infalling or ejected gas would encounter other gas moving at similar velocities , and would be undergo strong hydrodynamical shocks .",
    "shocks at speeds of @xmath40 km / s heat gas to temperatures of @xmath38 k.",
    "although the icm is dominated in mass and energetically by thermal plasma , it does contain magnetic fields and populations of relativistic , nonthermal particles as well .",
    "the most direct way to measure the magnetic field in clusters of galaxies is through the faraday rotation of the polarization of background or embedded radio sources @xcite .",
    "most strong extragalactic radio sources emit synchrotron radiation which is strongly linearly polarized .",
    "when this radiation passes through a magnetized plasma , the plane of polarization is rotated through an angle @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "the rotation measure , @xmath43 , is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the path length through the medium , and @xmath46 is the component of the magnetic field parallel to the direction of propagation of the radiation .",
    "the rotation measures seen through the central regions of clusters are @xmath47 rad m@xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , equation  ( [ eq : rm ] ) shows that the rotation measure only determines an integral of @xmath46 along the line of sight . and this integral is strongly affected by the poorly known topology of the magnetic field .",
    "field reversals along the line of sight will greatly reduce @xmath43 .",
    "if one assumes that the coherence length of the field is about 10 kpc , the rotation measure observations suggest that the typical magnetic field strength is @xmath49 g @xcite .",
    "this would imply that the fields are still significantly subthermal ; the ratio of magnetic to gas pressures is only @xmath50 . in the central regions of clusters with cooling cores ( sec .  [",
    "sec : centers ] ) , much larger rotations measures are observed ( @xmath51 rad m@xmath48 ) , which suggest that the magnetic fields in these regions may approach equipartition with the gas pressure .",
    "the grey - scale is the radio image of the cluster abell  3667 @xcite , while the contours are an x - ray image .",
    "the radio image shows two extended arcs , which are cluster radio relics , located to the southeast ( lower left ) and to the northwest ( upper right ) of the cluster center . these radio relics are believed to be associated with cluster merger shocks .",
    "( 1997 , the royal astronomical society . ) ]    in addition to the thermal plasma in the intracluster medium , significant population of relativistic electrons are observed in some clusters .",
    "the observations are crudely consistent with a power - law distribution for the relativistic particles ; that is , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 gives the number of electrons with energies in the range @xmath54 .",
    "similar distributions are seen in other astrophysical plasmas including the galactic cosmic rays . however , it is likely that the particle distributions are more complex , and also vary spatially .",
    "relativistic electrons interact with the intracluster magnetic field to produce synchrotron radio emission ; the electrons which produce the emission typically have energies @xmath55 gev .",
    "diffuse emission , not associated with any individual galaxy , is seen in @xmath1340 clusters of galaxies ; when the emission is centrally located , the sources are called `` cluster radio halos , '' while `` cluster radio relics '' are peripherally located @xcite . for example , figure  ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) shows two radio relic sources in the cluster abell  3667 @xcite .",
    "relativistic electrons in clusters can also produce observable emission through the inverse compton scattering of low energy photons ; the main source of these photons in clusters of galaxies is the cosmic microwave background .",
    "typically , inverse compton scattering produces emission which is observable either in the extreme - uv / soft x - ray band ( near 0.1 kev ) or in the the hard x - ray band ( 20100 kev ) .",
    "recently , inverse compton hard x - ray emission has been detected from several clusters @xcite , extreme - uv / soft x - ray emission , which might also be from relativistic electrons , may have also been detected @xcite . detecting both inverse compton and",
    "synchrotron emission from the same population of relativistic electrons is useful , because the synchrotron emission depends on the product of the energy density in relativistic electrons and that in the magnetic field , while inverse compton emission depends on the product of the energy density in relativistic electrons and that in the cosmic microwave background ( which is very well determined ) . in principle ,",
    "the combination of these two measurements allows both the total energy in relativistic electrons and the magnetic field strength to be determined .",
    "however , one needs to assume that the particles and magnetic field have the same distribution and that both are reasonably uniform , which may not be true . for the very few clusters with such data , the present observations and",
    "this simple argument suggest that the magnetic field strengths are @xmath56 g , about an order of magnitude smaller than those derived from faraday rotation .",
    "this disagreement may indicate that the assumption of a similar and uniform distribution for the particles and magnetic fields is wrong ; for example , the magnetic field in clusters may be very inhomogeneous . assuming these uncertain values are correct , the energy density and pressure in relativistic electrons may be a few percent of values for the thermal plasma in clusters .",
    "however , the total contribution from relativistic particles is also uncertain because the ions have not been detected .",
    "there now is considerable evidence that clusters of galaxies and other large structures in the universe form hierarchically ; that is , smaller structures form first , and gravity pulls these smaller structures together to make larger structures .",
    "clusters of galaxies form by the merger of smaller subclusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "major cluster mergers , in which two subclusters with a total mass of @xmath57 collide together at velocities of more than 2000 km / s , are the most energetic events which have occurred in the universe since the big bang itself @xcite .",
    "cluster mergers release total energies of @xmath58 erg .",
    "the motions in cluster mergers are transonic , and the mergers drive shocks into the intracluster gas . in major mergers , these merger shocks dissipate total energies of @xmath59 erg .",
    "such merger shocks are , in fact , the primary heating source of the intracluster plasma . for example , figure  ( [ fig : fig3 ] ) shows the chandra image of the merging cluster abell  85 @xcite .     the chandra x - ray image of the merger cluster abell  85 @xcite . the grey scale burns out the central cooling flow region to show the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "two subclusters to the south ( lower middle ) and southwest ( lower right ) are merging with the main cluster .",
    "the southwestern subcluster has a cluster radio relic .",
    "the sharp feature at the northwest of the southern subcluster is a `` cold front '' . ]",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation and evolution have shown the importance of merger shocks @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the structure of merger shocks is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , which shows an off - center merger between two symmetric subclusters . at early stages in the merger ( the first panel and earlier ) , the shocked region is located between the two subcluster centers and is bounded on either side by two shocks . at this time , the subcluster centers , which may contain cooling cores and central radio sources , are not affected .",
    "later , these shocks sweep over the subcluster centers ( between the first and second panels ) .",
    "the main merger shocks pass into the outer parts of the merging system ( panel 2 ) , and secondary shocks may appear in the inner regions ( panel 3 ) .",
    "eventually , the cluster begins to return to equilibrium ( panel 4 ) .",
    "the results of a hydrodynamical simulation of a symmetric , off - center cluster merger @xcite .",
    "the grey scale shows the temperature , while the contours are the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "initially , the shocked region is located between the two subcluster centers .",
    "later , the main merger shocks propogate to the outer parts of the cluster , and other weaker shocks also occur . by the end of the simulation",
    ", the cluster is beginning to return to equilibrium . ]    in addition to their thermal effects , astrophysical shocks at velocities @xmath60 km / s always convert at least a few percent of the shock energy into the acceleration of relativistic electrons and ions @xcite . in general , this occurs through a first - order fermi acceleration process .",
    "one would thus expect that merger shocks would produce relativistic electrons , which would be observable through radio synchrotron emission .",
    "in fact , cluster radio relic and cluster radio halo sources are seen in many clusters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetic ] ) . in every case",
    ", these clusters appear to be undergoing a cluster merger ; the cluster abell  3667 in figure  ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) is an example .",
    "recent chandra x - ray images indicate that the radio relics lie just behind merger shocks ; the central radio halos may be due to turbulent particle acceleration after the passage of the merger shock @xcite .",
    "one exciting discovery made with the chandra x - ray observatory is the importance of `` cold fronts '' in merging clusters .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : fig5 ] ) shows the cold front seen in the chandra x - ray image of the central regions of the merging cluster abell  3667 @xcite ; this is the same cluster shown in figure  ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the cold front is the sharp surface brightness discontinuity to the lower right .",
    "when these features were first seen , it was initially assumed that they merger shocks , and that the brighter inner region resulted from shock compression .",
    "however , x - ray spectral measurements show that these features are not shocks .",
    "the temperature of the denser gas is actually lower than that of the less dense gas in such a way that the pressure is continuous across the surface brightness discontinuity .",
    "thus , the specific entropy is actually lower in the denser region .",
    "shocks are irreversible changes which increase the density , pressure , and entropy .",
    "the observed `` cold fronts '' in clusters are not shocks , but rather contact discontinuities between higher density cool gas and lower density hot gas .",
    "a `` cold front '' seen in the chandra x - ray image of the central region of the merging cluster abell  3667 @xcite .",
    "[ this is the central region of the same cluster shown in figure  ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) . ]",
    "note the sharp discontinuity in the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "spectral analysis show that the brighter gas is actually cooler than the surrounding fainter gas .",
    "( 2001 , the american astronomical society . )",
    "]    as discussed below ( sec .",
    "[ sec : centers ] ) , the centers of many clusters often contain relative cool ( @xmath61 k rather than @xmath62 k ) gas .",
    "it is believed that cold fronts occur when clusters containing such cool cores merger .",
    "the gas in the core is dense enough to survive for some time after the merger .",
    "as the clusters merge , the cool cores move rapidly through the lower density shocked gas , producing the cold fronts .    observations of cluster merger shocks and cold fronts can be used to derive the kinematics of the merger @xcite .",
    "most of these diagnostics give the mach number of the merger @xmath63 , which is the ratio of the merger velocity to the sound speed in the pre - merger gas . the rankine ",
    "hugoniot jump conditions across a merger shock give the pressure increase across the shock and the shock compression as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the adiabatic index for fully ionized plasma , where @xmath66 is the shock compression , and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the pre - shock and post - shock gas .",
    "x - ray observations can provide the gas temperature and density on either side of the shock , and the jump conditions yield @xmath63 and the merger velocity .    for the case of a cold front ,",
    "the stagnation condition at the leading edge of the cold front gives @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the pressure at the stagnation point . if @xmath69 there will be a bow shock ahead of the cold front , and one can also apply the shock jump conditions , ( equation  [ eq : jumpm ] ) .",
    "the bow shock will be located at some distance ( the `` stand off '' distance @xmath70 ) ahead of the cold front , and the ratio of this distance to the radius of curvature of the cold front is a decreasing function of @xmath63 .",
    "finally , the opening angle of the mach cone formed from the merger shock will depend on the mach number as @xmath71 .",
    "applications of these techniques to observed cluster mergers give values for the merger mach number of @xmath72 and merger velocities of @xmath73 km / s @xcite .",
    "the grey scale image is the central @xmath74 kpc of the chandra x - ray image of the cooling core cluster abell  2052 @xcite .",
    "the contours are the radio image of the same region .",
    "the hot , x - ray gas is missing from two bubbles to the north ( up ) and south ( down ) , and bright x - ray shells surround these bubbles .",
    "the radio image shows that the bubbles are filled by radio emitting plasma containing relativistic electrons and magnetic fields . ]",
    "at the centers of many clusters of galaxies , the gas temperature is seen to drop significantly from @xmath38 k further out to @xmath75 k near the center . at the same time",
    ", the gas density rises very rapidly , which gives these regions very large x - ray surface brightnesses .",
    "the low gas temperatures and high gas densities are the result of radiative cooling of the gas .",
    "since the x - ray emissivity varies with the square of the density , while the thermal energy density is proportional to the gas density , the x - ray radiation we observe can cool the gas most rapidly in the dense , central regions of clusters . in these regions ,",
    "the radiative cooling times are @xmath76 yr , which is much shorter than the ages of typical clusters of @xmath77 yr . as the central gas cools , the weight of the overlying outer gas compresses the inner gas , resulting in cooler temperatures and very high densities .",
    "i will refer to these cool central regions as `` cooling cores '' .",
    "one mystery with previous x - ray observations was whether the gas continues to cool below @xmath75 k , and if so , what happens to it .",
    "the rates of gas cooling at higher temperature are quite large , and corresponding amounts of much cooling gas are not seen . however , at the center of every cluster with a cooling core , there is a giant cd galaxy .",
    "these cd galaxies are the largest galaxies seen in the universe , and are @xmath13 10 times larger in mass and radius than other very large galaxies .",
    "the cd galaxies at the centers of cooling flows often contain some cool gas and some star formation , although in amounts which are @xmath78% of those expected from the rates of radiative cooling of the x - ray gas .    in nearly every case , these central cd galaxies host radio sources .",
    "recent x - ray observations with the chandra x - ray observatory suggest that interactions between the radio source and the x - ray gas in the central regions of clusters strongly affects both components .",
    "for example , figure  ( [ fig : fig6 ] ) shows the inner region of the the cluster abell  2052 , which has a cooling core .",
    "the central cd galaxy has the strong radio source 3c  317 .",
    "there are central point sources in x - rays and radio which are coincident with the center of the cd galaxy , which is believed to contain a supermassive black hole .",
    "the extended radio emission corresponds with `` holes '' in the x - ray emission , and the radio source is surrounded by a brightened `` shell '' of x - ray emission .",
    "we refer to these structures as `` radio bubbles . ''",
    "similar structures are seen in many other cooling core clusters .",
    "the pressures in the x - ray - bright shells are nearly continuous with the pressure of the surrounding gas .",
    "there is no clear evidence for strong shocks .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the radio lobes are displacing and compressing the x - ray gas , but are , at the same time , confined by the x - ray gas .",
    "the radio bubbles contain relativistic electrons and magnetic fields , and emit radio synchrotron radiation .",
    "the total energy of the the radio plasma is @xmath79 erg .",
    "if this energy is eventually dissipated into thermal energy in the x - ray gas , the energy input would be sufficient to balance cooling for about @xmath62 yr , which is about the radiative cooling time of the gas .",
    "thus , energy input from radio sources at the centers of cooling core clusters may partly balance radiative cooling , and may help to explain why only a fraction of the x - ray gas cools to low temperatures .",
    "if there were no physical connection between the radio source and the x - ray emitting plasma in a cluster , then any balance between x - ray cooling and radio source heating would be a coincidence . however , one possibility is that the two are coupled , and form a `` feedback loop .",
    "'' observations of nearby examples indicate that all large galaxies , such as cluster - central cd galaxies , contain supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses of @xmath80 .",
    "radio sources occur when such a smbh accretes gas from its environment . in radio sources ,",
    "much of the energy release is converted into the kinetic energy of a pair of oppositely - directed jets of plasma which expand away from the black hole .",
    "consider an inactive smbh black hole at the center of a cd galaxy in the cooling core of a cluster . if there is no heat source to balance radiative cooling in the x - ray gas , it will cool and flow towards the central supermassive black hole .",
    "part of this gas will be accreted by the supermassive black hole , and the accretion energy ( gravitational binding energy ) will power radio jets",
    ". these will expand into the surrounding x - ray gas , and will inflate two radio bubbles like those in figure  ( [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "these bubbles will displace and may eventually heat the x - ray gas , balancing its radiative cooling .",
    "this will stop the flow of material towards the central smbh , and eventually turn off the radio source .",
    "heating from the radio source will be unable to prevent cooling of the x - ray gas , and the cycle will start anew .",
    "various arguments suggest that the radio sources in these systems are very strongly active for @xmath75 yr , and that the cycle repeats about every @xmath38 yr .",
    "recent observations and theoretical work indicate that the majority of the normal , baryonic matter in the low - redshift universe is in the form of hot , diffuse plasma .",
    "clusters of galaxies are particularly striking examples of this .",
    "large clusters contain @xmath81 of hot plasma at a temperature of @xmath38 k and typical electron densities of @xmath1 @xmath2 .",

    "this plasma emits most readily in the x - ray band .",
