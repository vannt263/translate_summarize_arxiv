    ", there is a class of the black hole initial data known as distorted black holes that bernstein et al @xcite introduced .",
    "they assumed the axisymmetric initial that consists in a black hole with or without rotation in interaction with a cloud of gravitational waves of variable intensity about the black hole .",
    "later , brandt et al @xcite relaxed the axisymmetry and considered the most general three - dimensional distorted black holes .",
    "an important motivation in establishing and evolving distorted black holes is to reproduce the late stages of binary black hole coalescence .",
    "in addition , the dynamics of distorted black holes can provide a simple framework to study in details the efficiency of gravitational wave extraction , together with the determination of wave templates perceived by a distant observer .",
    "recently , we have applied the galerkin - collocation spectral method @xcite to determine accurately two initial data sets for numerical relativity : pure brill waves , and axisymmetric non - rotating distorted black holes .",
    "these problems were considered previously in the realm of traditional pseudospectral @xcite and finite difference methods @xcite .",

    "another approach is the puncture method proposed by brandt and brugmann @xcite .",
    "this method proved to be very effective in describing initial data for multiple black holes , in particular binary black hole systems .",
    "basically , it consists in splitting the conformal factor of the spatial metric into singular and non - singular terms .",
    "brown and lowe @xcite applied the puncture method for the determination of distorted black holes spacetimes with the implementation of adaptive mesh refinement in their finite difference code to solve the elliptic equation resulting from the hamiltonian constraint . as they have pointed out",

    "the spherical harmonics are the most natural basis functions for the angular domain , whereas the radial basis functions are expressed as suitable linear combinations of the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the condition of inversion symmetry had to be satisfied by imposing a relation between the unknown modes .",
    "we have implemented the puncture method with a simple version of the domain decomposition that consists in dividing the spatial domain into several regions , wherein each region we solve the hamiltonian constraint and match these solutions across the domains .",
    "section iv shows the convergence tests together with the asymptotic behavior of the spin - weighted scalar @xmath0 which provides the pattern of the gravitational field associated to the distorted black hole at the initial slice . finally , in section v we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the basic equations for the initial data we are going to solve arise from the 3 + 1 formulation @xcite of the einstein s field equations .",
    "the initial data can not be specified arbitrarily , but it must satisfy in vacuum four constraint equations given by ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the metric and extrinsic curvature of the 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces that foliate the spacetime , respectively .",
    "all quantities are evaluated on the 3-dimensional hypersurfaces , and @xmath5 .",
    "these four equations are known as the hamiltonian and momentum constraints , respectively .    following brandt et al @xcite we are going to consider the initial data at the moment of time symmetry , meaning that the extrinsic curvature is zero , @xmath6 at the initial slice or hypersurface . in this case , three constraint equations vanish identically remaining the hamiltonian constraint @xmath7 which fixes the three - metric or initial data .",
    "it is appropriate to follow the york - lichnerowicz @xcite approach expressing the metric @xmath3 in conformal form ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the conformal factor and the metric @xmath10 are given .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint becomes ,    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the laplace operator and the ricci scalar associated to the metric @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "an alternative way of constructing isometric distorted black hole data sets is provided by the so - called puncture method @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the puncture method is to split the conformal factor into a singular and nonsingular terms , and to consider the whole spatial domain instead of being restricted to the region outside the throat of the hole .",

    "we have reduced further the number of independent coefficients by taking into account the symmetries of the gravitational wave amplitude ( cf .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the resulting equations are solved using standard linear solvers of maple or matlab , determining the coefficients and consequently the approximate conformal factor .       and @xmath81 viewed from the plane @xmath82 , where the bold line represents the boundary @xmath83 . ]    for the galerkin - collocation implementation of puncture method it is likewise necessary to establish an approximate expression for the function @xmath84 .",

    "we can interpret such patterns as the indicators of the gravitational waves at a large distance from the distorted black hole .",
    "the angular patterns present a rich structure that depend upon the parameters of the initial data , and can be understood as gravitational - wave fingerprints distorted black holes .",
    "the galerkin - collocation method is a viable alternative to solve the initial data problem of distorted three - dimensional black holes .",
    "the next natural direction of the present research is to study the dynamics of distorted black holes .",
    "there are two issues we will be focusing , namely , the gravitational wave templates produced in this dynamical process and the efficiency of the gravitational wave extraction .",
