    "@xcite , an sit was observed through scanning tunneling spectroscopy and penetration depth measurements .",
    "the effective disorder in nbn , given by the product of fermi wave vector ( @xmath3 ) and electronic mean free path ( @xmath4 ) , is introduced by controlling the vacancy of nb atoms .",
    "the insulating state at large disorder has been a subject of debate .",
    "finite frequency measurements of superfluid stiffness  @xcite have indicated the existence of a bose insulator state with localized cooper pairs .",
    "however , a better understanding of the sit and the associated insulating state in the large disorder limit requires more theoretical scrutiny .",
    "localized cooper pairs indicate a system with local attractive interactions , which are most appropriately represented by the attractive hubbard model ( ahm ) .",
    "the study of dirty superconductors can thus be naturally carried out by investigating the effect of disorder in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "the clean limit of the ahm has been extensively studied using bogoliubov - de gennes type mean field ( bdgmf ) theories and more recently using iterated perturbation theory with superconducting bath ( iptsc )  @xcite , numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite and continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc )  @xcite within dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .",
    "the main issue that has been focused on is the bcs - bec crossover for different fillings and interaction strengths .",
    "very recently , a statistical - dmft study of the bethe lattice disordered ahm has been carried out  @xcite .",
    "the systems investigated experimentally , such as nbn@xmath5  @xcite and ino@xmath5  @xcite are in the strong disorder limit , wherein the early theories of dirty superconductors , e.g by anderson  @xcite and by abrikosov and gorkov  @xcite are not really applicable .",
    "hence a proper theoretical approach is needed which treats the effects of strong attractive interactions and disorder on an equal footing .",
    "one such method , namely the bdgmf has been employed to investigate the ahm with site@xcite as well as bond disorder  @xcite",
    ". however , the method , being based on a mean field approximation , albeit inhomogeneous , has limitations in terms of not incorporating quantum fluctuations .",
    "recent nrg  @xcite calculations of the clean ahm also point out several deficiencies of the bdgmf method . beyond mean field ,",
    "qmc  @xcite studies of finite size lattices have validated the decrease of superconducting order parameter ( @xmath6 ) with increasing disorder , but due to finite size effects , a complete destruction of @xmath6 at large disorder could not be seen . however , with increasing temperature , a superconductor - insulator transition was observed in the dc conductivity calculations .    in this work",
    ", we carry out a detailed study of the disordered ahm by combining coherent potential approximation(cpa )  @xcite , with dmft and iterated perturbation theory for superconductivity(iptsc ) .",
    "the iptsc solver has the advantage over methods such as qmc of obtaining real frequency spectra at zero temperature and in the thermodynamic limit , while being computationally inexpensive .",
    "the reliability of our approach is enhanced by the fact that the iptsc is known to benchmark well with nrg results for the clean ahm . to distinguish between dynamical and static effects ,",
    "we have also carried out bdgmf studies within cpa+dmft . as anticipated by the previous inhomogeneous mean field and qmc calculations",
    ", we find a sit with increasing disorder .",
    "we map out the detailed behaviour of the sit in the disorder - interaction plane .",
    "we also investigate the distribution of the local order parameter , and point out that some of the subtle aspects of the experimentally observed sit require an extension of single - site dmft through e.g the statistical dmft or cluster extensions such as the dynamical cluster approximation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the following section , we outline the model and the formalism used .",
    "next , we present our results for the local order parameter , the spectra , the distribution of the order parameter and the phase diagram .",
    "we conclude in the final section .",
    "the attractive hubbard model ( ahm ) is expressed , in standard second quantized notation by the following hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 annihilates an electron on @xmath9 lattice site with spin @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is nearest - neighbour hopping amplitude , @xmath13 is site - energy , and @xmath14 is chemical potential .",
    "the disorder is represented by randomness in site energies , which we choose to be distributed according to a uniform probability distribution function @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath1 is disorder strength in unit of @xmath17 .",
    "the cpa in conjunction with dmft is the best single - site approach to study the interplay of disorder with interactions in strongly correlated systems  @xcite . to investigate the effects of disorder on the superconducting state",
    ", we employ the best single - site quantum approaches , namely dmft in conjunction with cpa . within dmft",
    ", the lattice model is mapped onto a single - impurity model embedded in a self - consistently determined bath . for the present problem ,",
    "the effective medium is in a superconducting state , hence the nambu formalism must be used .",
    "the impurity green s function in nambu formalism is given as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are components of the disorder - averaged hybridisation function matrix @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are normal and anomalous self - energies of the @xmath9 site respectively .",
    "to calculate the local self - energies , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the @xmath9 site , we use iterated perturbation theory for superconductivity ( iptsc)@xcite as the impurity solver . in the iptsc method , based on second order perturbation theory ,",

    "we review the physics of the clean ahm within dmft briefly . at half - filling ( @xmath63 )",
    ", it is well known that the ahm has two instabilities , namely superconductivity and charge - density wave ( cdw ) . if the cdw instability is ignored , then the superconducting order parameter ( @xmath6 ) becomes non - zero only for @xmath64 .",

    "the system has a superconducting gap @xmath74 .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we show the spectral gap and the disorder - averaged superconducting order parameter as a function of disorder in the bottom and top panels respectively . it is observed that the gap decreases , reaches a minimum , and then increases with increasing disorder .",
    "this kind of behaviour of spectral gap with disorder is also reported in@xcite .",
    "the order parameter , in contrast to the gap , decreases monotonically with increasing disorder and vanishes beyond @xmath78 .",
    "this result , which states that the superconducting state is destroyed beyond a critical disorder strength is consistent with previous qmc results , although the latter were obtained through extrapolation for finite size lattices .",
    "we show the bdgmf(cpa ) result ( dashed line ) also in the same figure , and it is seen that the mean - field result and the full dmft result hardly differ , indicating that local quantum fluctuations are not playing a significant role in the destruction of the superconducting state . since the order parameter is finite for @xmath81 , the spectral gap is a superconducting gap , while for higher disorder ( @xmath82 ) , since @xmath83 , @xmath74 represents an insulating gap .",
    "we also show the bdgmf(cpa ) results for @xmath6 and @xmath74 in the same figure .",
    "it is seen that the spectral gap is overestimated by the static mean field approach for finite disorder , as was found at @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the gap on @xmath1 is non - monotonic , and deserves some attention . for weak disorder ,",
    "the gap decreases with increasing @xmath1 , and this may be understood through the clean ahm . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the spectral gap becomes smaller and asymmetric ( about the chemical potential ) , with either increasing or decreasing the filling away from 1  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that with increasing disorder , since most sites would be off - half - filling , the spectral gap within cpa , arising as the arithmetic mean of the individual spectra , would decrease for weak disorder .",
    "the preceding argument assumes that the hybridization remains largely unaffected , which is true for weak disorder .",
    "however , for moderate and large disorder , the hybridization gets modified strongly , and the simple arithmetic averaging result can not be used to understand the increase in gap at larger disorder values ( @xmath84 ) . in order to understand the behaviour at large disorder",
    ", we will need to probe the distribution of the order parameter and gap over all the sites in the lattice .",
    "this is considered next .",

    "[ fig : fig5](a ) , the probability distribution function of local superconducting order parameter ( pdf - op ) for different values of @xmath1 is shown . for small disorder",
    ", the pdf - op is broad , and peaked moderately at a certain typical value of @xmath6 . with increasing @xmath1 the typical @xmath6 decreases sharply and the pdf - op narrows down considerably .",
    "this indicates that , while in the weak disorder limit , arithmetic averaging may be used , in the strong disorder limit the typical value will manifest macroscopically .",
    "this is also reflected in the probability distribution function for spectral gap ( pdf - sg ) . as expected , the pdf - sg is also broad at weak disorder and narrows considerably at large disorder .",
    "in fact , since the weight contained in the peak is almost more than 50% , most of the sites will have a gap in the neighbourhood of the gap value corresponding to the peak . since the peak occurs at higher values of the gap with increasing @xmath1 , the gap in the cpa spectral function , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , increases with increasing @xmath1 . in previous literature based on bdgmf or qmc of finite lattices incorporating inhomogeneous order parameters , this increase in gap as a function of @xmath1 has been attributed to decrease in localization length .",
    "our results are based on the cpa , which is known to ignore localization effects .",
    "thus we suggest that the arguments based on pdf are sufficient , and localization physics need not be invoked to explain the increase of the insulating gap .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of this problem could be through typical medium theory , and subsequently statistical dmft .",

    "for the clean case ( @xmath61 ) , as mentioned before , @xmath6 increases and eventually saturates with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , at finite disorder , @xmath79 increases , reaches a maximum and subsequently decreases .",
    "thus when we turn on disorder , the order parameter dependence on @xmath0 changes qualitatively .",
    "this can again be understood very simply from the clean ahm result , that at a fixed @xmath0 , @xmath6 decreases with increasing particle - hole asymmetry defined by @xmath90 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) . for a larger @xmath0 ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath6 with increasing @xmath91 is much more rapid .",
    "increasing site - disorder implies creating a greater number of sites with large @xmath91 , which would have a smaller @xmath6 as compared to the sites with @xmath92 .",
    "thus , with increasing interaction strength , and a fixed disorder concentration , the superconducting order parameter should decrease , and is indeed obtained .",
    "beyond which the superconducting state is completely destroyed is shown as a function of @xmath0 . ]",
    "the variation of the spectral gap and the superconducting order parameter , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , was for a specific interaction strength , namely @xmath75 .",
    "we have repeated our calculations for various other @xmath0 values , and could thus find the critical disorder strength @xmath93 , beyond which the superconducting state is completely destroyed . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] , we find that for large @xmath0 , the @xmath93 decreases with increasing the interaction strength .",
    "this kind of behaviour is also seen in qmc calculations of finite lattices through extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "the superconducting state persists to higher disorder values with increasing @xmath0 in the weak to moderate coupling regime , in contrast to the strong coupling regime .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effects of site - disorder on a s - wave superconducting state as represented by an inhomogeneous attractive hubbard model .",
    "our theoretical approach combines dmft with iptsc as an impurity solver and the cpa .",
    "detailed studies of ( a ) the clean system away from half - filling and ( b ) probability distributions of the spectral gap and order parameter have been carried out .",
    "we have computed single - particle quantities such as the diagonal and off - diagonal spectral functions in the disorder-@xmath0 plane . using these",
    ", we obtained the spectral gap , superconducting order parameter and their probability distributions for different values of disorder and interaction strength .",
    "some of our results agree qualitatively with those of previous studies  @xcite .",
    "these include the non - monotonic dependence of the spectral gap on the interaction strength , the destruction of the superconducting state with disorder and a concomitant superconductor - insulator transition . these studies  @xcite were carried out on two - dimensional lattices , while our work is within dmft .",
    "thus , we conclude that dimensionality has little role to play in these results .",
    "we further argue that our results may be explained by utilizing particle - hole asymmetry and disorder induced probability distributions , with no necessity to invoke localization physics .    in order to probe localization physics within local approaches",
    ", one must ideally incorporate short - range correlations using techniques such as typical medium - dynamical cluster approximation  @xcite .",
