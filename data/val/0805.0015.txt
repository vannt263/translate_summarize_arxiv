    "diode lasers have come to play a fundamental role in experimental physics .",
    "their low cost , efficiency , and small size , among other things , have made them a standard part of many experiments @xcite . while many turn - key extended - cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) systems are presently available , they are typically much more expensive than the cost of the parts required to build a custom system , and they are not easily serviced when problems arise .",
    "also , it is difficult to modify them for special purposes , and they do not provide the extreme stability and narrow line - widths needed for many applications . as such , many researchers continue to design and build custom ecdls . in this paper",
    "we discuss the design and performance of a precision current driver , one of the key components in any ecdl system .",
    "the laser current controller we present was designed to meet the specifications needed for the master laser of an optical frequency standard , one of the most demanding ecdl applications .",
    "optical frequency standards require a laser with a line - width of a few khz or less .",
    "to achieve this , these lasers need to have the current stabilized to within a few tens of nano - amperes rms over relevant time scales , and typically must be locked to a high - finesse cavity . to simplify the lock to the cavity , it is desirable for the laser current driver to have a modulation input with enough bandwidth to allow feedback through the current driver .",
    "this reduces complexity and reduces the chance of destroying the diode when compared to applying feedback directly to the diode .",
    "our current driver has several unique design features .",
    "the noise and stability of our current driver are as good or better than any laser current driver we are aware of .",
    "the current driver also has a modulation input with a 3 db roll off above 20 mhz .",
    "this is much larger than any of the commercial drivers we have seen , and it maintains its high stability and low noise even while the high - bandwidth modulation circuit is active and connected to the driver s output .",
    "the driver is also relatively small in size and features remote programming , allowing the driver to be placed near the laser to remove the negative effects of long cables .",
    "this design is inexpensive enough to be used as a reliable lab standard or in student lab experiments .",
    "our design builds upon the hall - libbrecht current driver @xcite , a precision current controller design which has been used extensively in atomic physics labs .",
    "we made several design improvements and updated components .",
    "the most radical improvement is the use of a precision digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) , rather than a potentiometer , to program the current set point .",
    "this eliminates a major source of noise and instability .",
    "this also makes it possible to program the current set point remotely , allowing the current driver to be placed in close proximity to the laser diode .",
    "this can significantly reduce current noise at the laser , and will lower phase shifts when using the modulation input .",
    "the use of a dac also allows much more accurate control of the current set point , and makes it possible to return to a previous current set point with extremely high precision .",
    "our driver utilizes surface mount technology , allowing us to use the most modern components and reducing inductance and noise pick - up from longer pin leads .",
    "in addition to explaining our improvements to the hall - libbrecht circuit we present a much more detailed description and a more comprehensive and careful performance analysis of our design than was given in @xcite .",
    "this discussion illuminates both our improvements as well as subtleties present in the hall - libbrecht driver which were not discussed in @xcite .",
    "in figure [ cap : schematic ] we have broken the schematic of the circuit into several sections , which we will address separately .",
    "as presented , the circuit is configured to drive cathode grounded lasers , but we have also constructed anode - grounded supplies with a few straightforward modifications .",
    "although not indicated on the schematic , each op - amp is powered by the filtered voltages @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with a pair of capacitors connected between power and ground near each power pin of each op - amp .",
    "surface - mount ceramic capacitors @xmath2 and @xmath3 in value are used for the op - amps in the `` modulation input '' sub - circuit , the quad op - amp in the `` differential buffers '' sub - circuit , and the op - amp used for the differential amplifier in the `` current monitor '' sub - circuit . for the power lines for the other three op - amps a @xmath4 ceramic capacitor and a @xmath5 electrolytic capacitor",
    "the circuit is laid out on a 6.125 x 4.25 inch printed circuit board ( pcb ) that is electrically isolated from the cast aluminum box it is mounted in .",
    "all of the resistors , with the exception of the ones specifically discussed in the sections below , are standard 1/8 watt thick - film chip resistors with a temperature coefficient of @xmath6 ppm/@xmath7 in a 1206 surface mount package .",
    "all of the non - polar capacitors are ceramic capacitors in a 1206 surface mount package .",
    "other components are discussed later .",
    "the heart of the current driver is the `` current regulation '' sub - circuit .",
    "this sub - circuit is a fairly standard current source design @xcite , but components have been chosen very carefully for optimal performance . in this sub - circuit a regulated voltage , labeled @xmath8 in fig.[cap : schematic ] , is used to drive current through a precision sense resistor , labeled @xmath9 , to the output of the driver .",
    "the amount of current flowing out to the laser diode can be determined from the voltage drop across @xmath9 .",
    "one side of the sense resistor is connected to the inverting input of an ad8671 precision op - amp , and the output of the op - amp is connected to the gate of an nds0605 mosfet .",
    "negative feedback in this circuit causes the mosfet gate voltage to change , modifying the current flowing through the mosfet , until the voltage at the output of the sense resistor is equal to the set voltage , @xmath10 , applied to the non - inverting input of the op - amp . in this way",
    "the op - amp forces the current to remain fixed at a value of @xmath11 regardless of the load impedance . due to the mosfet s gate capacitance ,",
    "the resistors and capacitor on the line between the op - amp and the mosfet are needed to reduce the bandwidth of the circuit and prevent oscillations . as was done in @xcite ,",
    "an inductor is placed after the mosfet to limit high - frequency current noise and to de - couple the current regulation electronics from any intentionally - applied current modulation .",
    "the sense resistor is a key component which needs to be considered carefully  stability of the current driver can be no better than the stability of this resistor .",
    "the value for @xmath9 should be chosen to provide a large enough voltage drop for accurate current regulation at the target current , but small enough such that the voltage drop across this resistor does not reduce the compliance voltage of the driver below what is necessary to power the laser diode .",
    "when driving a red diode laser to a maximum current of 100 ma , we used a pair of 100 ohm vishay smr3d precision resistors in parallel for a total resistance of 50 ohms .",
    "these parts are surface - mount components for reduced noise pickup and have a low temperature coefficient of just 2 ppm/@xmath7 . for higher / lower current applications , smaller",
    "/ larger resistance values could be used . in applications that do nt require the highest stability , resistors with higher temperature coefficients may be used .",
    "the op - amp we used was the ad8671 from analog devices @xcite .",
    "similar to the lt1028 used in the original hall design @xcite , this op - amp has voltage noise levels comparable to the johnson noise of a 50 ohm resistor , the ad8671 having slightly better current noise and slightly poorer voltage noise than the lt1028 . in practice , as well as in numerical spice models",
    ", we found that the ad8671 was less prone to oscillate in this circuit than the lt1028 , requiring less severe bandwidth limiting to make the circuit stable .",
    "the ad8671 chip also has a _ much _ higher input impedance ( both common and differential mode ) than the lt1028 with comparable input capacitance",
    ". this property limits current drift due to thermal or other changes in the leakage current into the op - amp inputs .",
    "in addition , the ad8671 does not require any sort of trim or compensation to achieve low bias and low overshoot in our application .",
    "although the ad8671 has a somewhat smaller gain - bandwidth product ( gbp ) than the lt1028 used in the original hall design ( 10 mhz vs 50 mhz ) , the filtering capacitors and resistors needed to stabilize the circuit effectively remove any additional bandwidth that would be gained by using the lt1028 .",
    "furthermore , the inherent low noise of the circuit and the use of the de - coupling inductor makes higher bandwidth in this part of the circuit unnecessary .",
    "it is worth noting here that we have used the ad8671 op - amps throughout most of the circuit .",
    "the hall design used lt1028 op - amps only in two  \" critical  \" locations , with different op - amps being used in the modulation input circuit and the monitoring circuit . since both of these circuits connect directly to the current output , it made sense to us to take advantage of the low noise and high input impedance of the ad8671 .",
    "though more expensive than many lower performance op - amps , they are still a relatively inexpensive part of this circuit .    for the inductor",
    "we choose a @xmath12 api delevan series s1210 ferrite core shielded surface - mount inductor .",
    "the nds0605 mosfet was chosen for its low on - state resistance and a relatively large current carrying capacity in a small form factor .",
    "it also has a small input capacitance , small switching delays , and low gate - body leakage .      the set - point voltage , @xmath10 , which is applied to the non - inverting input of the op - amp in the `` current regulation '' sub - circuit is generated by a precision digital to analog converter ( dac ) .",
    "using a precision dac rather than a manual potentiometer removes a significant source of noise and drift in the circuit .",
    "in addition , it affords much greater accuracy and repeatability .",
    "we did an extensive search to find a dac which would optimize long - term stability .",
    "the chip we settled on is the 16-bit ad5541 @xcite .",
    "this chip comes in several performance grades .",
    "all grades have the same stability , temperature coefficient , and repeatability , but differ in the absolute accuracy of the output .",
    "we chose the `` j '' grade , mainly because it was carried by our regular electronics supplier , but lower cost / lower performance and higher cost / higher performance grades are also available .",
    "for applications where the noise and stability of the current driver are not a great concern , we have included pads on the pcb where a traditional potentiometer can be used in place of the dac .",
    "the ad5541 chip is specified to have a zero - code temperature coefficient of 0.05 ppm/@xmath7 and a gain error temperature coefficient of 0.1 ppm/@xmath7 , both of which are significantly less than the temperature coefficient of the sense resistors discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : currentregulation ] .",
    "the accuracy of the `` j '' grade chip is guaranteed to be at least as good as @xmath13 times the least significant bit ( lsb ) , or 2 parts in 65,535 . for our test setup",
    "we used a 50 ohm sense resistor resulting in a maximum current output of 100 mv .",
    "this corresponds to an accuracy of @xmath14 , similar to its measured accuracy discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : accuracyandrepeatability ] .    the output of the dac can be set anywhere from the voltage of its analog ground pin ( labeled @xmath15 in fig .  [",
    "cap : schematic ] ) up to the voltage applied to its reference input . as was done with the analog potentiometer used in @xcite , the ground pin of the dac in our circuit",
    "is not connected directly to board ground .",
    "there are two reasons why this is necessary .",
    "the first is that the output current of the circuit does not depend on the set point voltage relative to board ground , but relative to @xmath8 . as such ,",
    "if the voltage @xmath8 drifts relative to board ground , we want @xmath10 to drift with it such that @xmath16 remains constant .",
    "the second is that the dac requires the voltage on its reference to be no greater than @xmath17 above the voltage of its analog ground pin . in order to adjust the output current of the device all",
    "they way down to zero 0 , it must be possible to make @xmath10 at least as large as @xmath8 .",
    "this imposes a lower limit on the voltage applied to the analog ground pin .    in our circuit @xmath8",
    "is applied directly to the dac s reference pin , and a voltage of @xmath18 ( labeled @xmath15 in fig.[cap : schematic ] ) is applied to the dac s ground pin , giving the current driver an output current which can range from 0 to @xmath19 .",
    "the voltage @xmath15 , is generated using an lm399 zener diode connected to @xmath8 , which creates an extremely stable 6.95 v drop .",
    "the resistors @xmath20 and @xmath21 make a voltage divider to lower this 6.95 v difference closer to the required 5 volts .",
    "we then buffer the voltage with an op - amp .",
    "any drift in the ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath23 will result in a drift in the current set point , but there is much less sensitivity to thermal drift in these resistors than in the sense resistor @xmath9 because only the ratio , and not the absolute resistance matters .",
    "both resistors are made of the same material and are in close proximity such that they will have similar thermal drifts .",
    "for these two resistors we use vishay tnpw0805 precision resistors which have an accuracy tolerance of 0.1% and a thermal coefficient of 25 ppm/@xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath24 resistor in this sub - circuit is a vishay tnpw04027501dt9 precision , low - temperature coefficient resistor .",
    "we expect , however , that using a standard resistor in this location would not affect the performance of the current driver .",
    "similar to what was done in @xcite , a pair of low - pass filters reduce high frequency noise in @xmath10 . because the output current of the circuit depends not on the difference of @xmath10 from board ground , but on the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath8 , these filters ( as well as the low pass filter in the current regulation sub - circuit ) are tied to @xmath8 rather than ground .",
    "the `` power filter '' sub - circuit generates stable , filtered voltages for the rest of the circuit .",
    "this sub - circuit is nearly identical to the one in @xcite .",
    "we have added some additional filter capacitors , changed some component values to optimize performance , and added two protection diodes between the three pins of the lm317 voltage regulator , as recommended by the manufacturer @xcite .",
    "we have also used surface - mount components wherever possible to reduce noise and stray inductance .    in this part of the circuit ,",
    "power lines are first filtered by a series of capacitors and inductors to provide the positive and negative voltages @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are used to power all of the op - amps in the circuit .",
    "the filtered power is then regulated with the lm317 adjustable voltage regulator to generate the extremely stable voltage labeled @xmath8 .",
    "this voltage is used to drive current to the laser diode in the `` current regulation '' sub - circuit and to generate the set - point voltage in the `` digital set point '' sub - circuit as described above .",
    "the transistor below the lm317 is part of an enable / slow start mechanism discussed in @xcite .",
    "this soft - start feature helps protect the laser diode from damage , and in the case of a power failure it also allows the digital controller time to reset the current set point before @xmath8 turns fully on after power is restored .",
    "the regulated output level of the lm317 is nominally equal to @xmath25 when the _ enable _ switch is grounded , the current driver is `` disabled . '' in this case the resistor @xmath26 is placed in parallel with both the impedance of the transistor and with the series resistance of the resistor labeled @xmath27 and the 1 k@xmath28 resistor near the switch .",
    "this effectively reduces the value of @xmath26 in eq.[eq : vreg ] . with a proper choice of resistor values it is possible to make @xmath8 insufficiently large to forward bias the laser diode when the switch is in this position .    when the switch is opened , if not for the 1 @xmath29f capacitor , current would immediately cease to flow through @xmath27 .",
    "this would cause the voltage at the gate of the transistor to suddenly equal the voltage at the emitter of the transistor , shutting off current through the transistor as well , restoring the voltage regulator to its full output value as if the soft - start circuitry was not present .",
    "the presence of the 1 @xmath29f capacitor prevents the current flowing through @xmath27 from abruptly stopping .",
    "instead , the current continues to flow as the capacitor charges , and the voltage rises on the gate of the transistor slowly .",
    "this causes the voltage regulator s output to gradually increase to its final value .",
    "because of the non - linear nature of the transistor , the start time is considerably larger than just the @xmath30 time constant of the resistor @xmath27 and the 1 @xmath29f capacitor . using a value of @xmath31 and a mmbt2907a transistor in our setup",
    ", we measured a start - up time constant of 11.5 ms .",
    "the @xmath32 capacitors are low - leakage radial aluminum electrolytic capacitors , and the @xmath33 capacitors are surface - mount tantalum capacitors . while developing this circuit the 1.5@xmath28 resistor in the upper right - hand corner of the schematic overheated , probably due to increased current draw when our lt1028 op - amps oscillated or saturated . while diagnosing this problem , we installed a vishay wsc-1 series 1 watt surface - mount wire - wound power resistor .",
    "we have experienced no such difficulties since we began using ad8671 op - amps , and have since replaced this resistor with a standard 1/8 watt metal film resistor . although we do nt expect the choice of resistor to affect performance",
    ", one should note that the wire - wound resistor was still installed while taking the data presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the `` modulation input '' sub - circuit is the same one used and described in @xcite .",
    "the key components in this circuit are the upper op - amp and the two resistors labeled @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( the lower op - amp is part of a balancing circuit that we describe later ) .",
    "the non - inverting input of the upper op - amp is connected directly to the output of the current driver , which is at a voltage @xmath36 .",
    "the op - amp is wired to generate a gain of @xmath37 , such that it generates a voltage of @xmath38 at its output .",
    "the output of the op - amp is connected to the current driver s output through a @xmath39 resistor , labeled @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ cap : schematic ] .",
    "the voltage drop across this resistor is equal to @xmath40 , and so the current flowing through this resistor is @xmath41 . a second identical resistor , labeled @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ cap : schematic ] connects the output of the laser driver to the modulation input . if a voltage @xmath42 is applied to this input , the current flowing through this resistor is @xmath43 .",
    "the current which is added to the output of the laser driver is just the difference in these two currents , @xmath44 .",
    "this injected current inevitably results in a change of the output voltage of the current driver , but the op - amp constantly corrects its output to keep it equal to @xmath38 as @xmath36 changes .",
    "in addition to the modulation current , an additional bias current will be injected by this sub - circuit if the @xmath45 resistors are not equally matched or if the gains in the two amplifiers are not correct .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 and @xmath35 differ by some small fraction @xmath46 , the modulation current injected into the laser will be @xmath47 the bias term ( the second term in the above equation ) will cause current measurements based on the voltage drop across @xmath9 to be inaccurate . and if resistances change in time , due to thermal effects for example , this bias current will change , affecting the stability of the current driver . as such , these resistors need to be well matched and have a fairly low temperature coefficient .",
    "all of the resistors in the `` modulation input '' sub - circuit except for the @xmath48 impedance matching resistor on the @xmath49 input are vishay tnpw0805 surface - mount thin - film chip resistors with a resistance tolerance of @xmath50 and a temperature coefficient of 25 ppm/@xmath51c",
    ". with this accuracy , the bias term in eq.[eq : imodb ] should be no larger than @xmath52 when driving a typical red laser diode ( for which @xmath53 ) . because the resistors @xmath34 and @xmath35 have the same composition and are physically close to each other , such that they should be at similar temperatures , we would nt expect temperature to have a large effect on the matching of the two resistors .",
    "accordingly , the fact that these resistors have a much larger temperature coefficient than the current sense resistor discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : currentregulation ] should have no significant effect on the stability of the current driver .",
    "the lower op - amp in this sub - circuit forces @xmath42 to 0 v when nothing is connected to the modulation input ( alternatively , this part of the circuit could be left off , and the modulation input could be shorted to ground or the `` modulation input '' sub - circuit completely disconnected from the current output when not in use ) .",
    "this op - amp generates a voltage of @xmath54 which is connected to the modulation input through two more @xmath55 resistors , labeled @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that , if these are perfectly matched to the other two resistors , the voltage at the modulation input will float to zero when nothing is connected to it . if they are not exactly balanced , an additional bias current will be injected into the output of the current driver when the modulation input is floating .",
    "given the precision of these resistors , we would expect this bias to be on the order of @xmath58 and we would nt expect that temperature drift should be an issue .",
    "although not discussed in @xcite , we have come to realize that this design allows modulation speeds greater than the bandwidth of the op - amps . at very high modulation frequencies",
    "one would expect that the op - amp would not be able to follow the changes in @xmath36 induced by the oscillating modulation current . in this limit , if we assume that the current driver is connected to a load with impedance @xmath59 , that the output of the upper op - amp in this sub - circuit settles to twice the time - averaged output voltage , and that @xmath60 , eq .  [ eq : imodb ] becomes @xmath61 if @xmath62 , then this equation is nearly the same as the low frequency limit in eq .",
    "[ eq : imodb ] .",
    "if the op - amp is modeled as an ideal op - amp with a low - pass filter with a time constant of @xmath63 on its input , it can easily be shown that @xmath64 changes monotonically from it s low - frequency value of @xmath65 to this high frequency limit as the modulation frequency increases . using this model ,",
    "the phase shift of @xmath64 goes to zero in both the low- and high - frequency limits , with the largest phase shift , occurring at a frequency of @xmath66 , being equal to @xmath67 once again , if @xmath62 , the maximum phase shift in this simplified model will be very small .",
    "the `` current monitor '' sub - circuit generates a voltage proportional to the output current of the driver so that the output can be monitored .",
    "the first op - amp in this sub - circuit buffers the voltage at the low - voltage side of the sense resistor @xmath9 with a high input impedance op - amp .",
    "this decouples the current monitor output from the current regulation sub - circuit so that measurements can be made without significantly affecting the output of the current driver .",
    "the second op - amp subtracts this voltage from @xmath8 to produce a voltage relative to the board s ground equal to @xmath68 .",
    "because the output of the current monitor sub - circuit is referenced to board ground , attaching a meter to this output could potentially introduce ground noise .",
    "op - amp `` c '' in the `` differential buffers '' sub - circuit eliminates this problem , decoupling the meter s ground from the circuit .",
    "similarly , the other three op - amps in this sub - circuit decouple the current driver s ground from the grounds of the three digital input lines which program the dac ( labeled @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 on fig .",
    "[ cap : schematic ] ) .",
    "these three op - amps are also used to re - reference the digital inputs to the ground pin of the dac ( which is not board ground ) .",
    "the circuit can be controlled by any device capable of generating a 16-bit serial ttl signal as well as a ttl clock and enable signal @xcite . to collect some of the data presented in this paper",
    ", we used a digital output card on a computer for this purpose .",
    "we have also developed a dedicated digital control circuit based on a pic18f4550 microprocessor .",
    "this is a 40-pin usb programmable microprocessor with 35 input / output pins .",
    "it is programmed to read in the signal from a digital encoder , and subsequently output a value to the dac . the micro - controller maintains stability and eliminates noise pickup by only outputting values to the dac when the user changes the current set point .",
    "the pic18f4550 also includes a built - in analog to digital converter ( adc ) which we use to read back and display @xmath72 .      to protect the laser diode",
    ", it is often desirable to limit the maximum output current of the driver . an easy way to do",
    "this is by changing the resistance of the sense resistor , @xmath9 .",
    "because the dac can only generate a set - point voltage as low as @xmath73 , the maximum output of the current driver will be @xmath74 .",
    "however , because the modulation current from the modulation input sub - circuit does not pass through the sense resistor , it is possible to exceed this maximum current by applying a large enough voltage to the modulation input .    as discussed in @xcite , another way to limit",
    "the output current is by reducing the voltage @xmath8 .",
    "the compliance voltage of the current driver is determined by the impedance of the mosfet and the inductor in the current regulation sub - circuit and the value of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath75 is the maximum current for the laser diode , and if @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the voltage drops across the laser diode , the mosfet , and the inductor ( respectively ) at this current , then if @xmath8 is set to@xmath79 the current driver output will not be able to exceed @xmath75 .",
    "the above voltage drops can be estimated from the specifications of the components , or the ideal value for @xmath8 can be determined empirically by setting @xmath10 to its lowest value and gradually increasing @xmath8 until the output current equals @xmath75 .",
    "because an inductor decouples the modulation input sub - circuit from the current regulation sub - circuit , a high - frequency signal on the modulation input could cause the current driver to output more than @xmath75 . at low modulation frequencies",
    "the output current will never exceed @xmath75 , regardless of the amplitude of the voltage applied to the modulation input .",
    "the maximum current that can be generated without risking damage to the current driver is 127 ma ( limited by the s1210 inductor ) . for higher current applications , we designed our circuit boards to accommodate both surface - mount and leaded components at a few critical points , allowing a wide range of components to be used .",
    "for example , we have realized a high current driver for a tapered amplifier by replacing the following components : the s1210 inductor ( rated for 127 ma ) as well as the two inductors in the  \" power filter  \"",

    "although these substitutions increase the noise and reduce the stability of the circuit , they allow an output of 2 a ( limited intentionally by our choice of @xmath9 to match the capacity of our tapered amplifier ) .",

    "this data suggests a temperature coefficient of @xmath83 , precisely what would be expected given the @xmath84 temperature coefficient of the sense resistor .      the use of a digital set point results in very good accuracy , linearity , and repeatability .",
    "we tested the linearity of the set point by connecting our current driver to a laser diode in series with a 10 @xmath28 precision resistor .",
    "we then determined the actual current produced by the driver at various digital set points by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor .",
    "the deviation of the actual current from a best - fit line is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : accuracy](a ) .",
    "the linearity is within the @xmath13 lsb specification for the dac chip we used . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : currentsetpoint ] , similar chips with higher or lower linearity are available .",
    "lsb points specified in the dac s data sheet . plot ( b ) show the rms repeatability of the current output , measured as a function of the digitally programmed set point .",
    "[ cap : accuracy ] ]    the set point repeatability of our circuit is much better than the absolute accuracy . to test the repeatability ,",
    "the current set point was set digitally , and the actual current was measured .",
    "the digital set point was then changed momentarily to significantly increase the output current .",
    "the digital set point was then reset to its original value , and the actual current was re - measured .",
    "this was done ten times at each digital set point , and the rms deviation of those ten measurements was calculated .",
    "the rms deviation is plotted as a function of the digital current set point in fig .",
    "[ cap : accuracy](b ) . as shown in this figure , the set - point repeatability is about 40 na rms .",
    "we measured the modulation response of the current driver by terminating the output with a 50 @xmath28 resistor and comparing the amplitude of a sine wave applied to the modulation input of the current driver input to the amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage modulation generated across this resistor .",
    "the output amplitude was then normalized to the expected output of @xmath44 to produce the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : temporal](a ) .",
    "we found the 3 db point to be over 20 mhz , with an attenuation of less than 4 db out past 100 mhz .",
    "we found , however , that the frequency response was severely degraded when driving reactive loads .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : currentmodulation ] , this is a much better frequency response than one might naively expect based on the bandwidth of the op - amps .",
    "response for the signal applied to the modulation input .",
    "the dashed line is the theoretical high frequency response assuming ideal components and transmission lines given by eq .",
    "[ eq : hfmodlimit ] . in ( b ) the transient response of the current driver to a total load change of roughly 3%",
    "the black line is the current through the load , and the gray line is the impedance of the load .",
    "[ cap : temporal ] ]      the transient response of the current driver was studied by using it to drive current through a 10 @xmath28 resistor in series with a vzn1206 mosfet .",
    "the transistor gate voltage was suddenly changed to vary the overall impedance of the load seen by the current driver .",
    "the current was determined from the voltage across the resistor , and the time - varying impedance was calculated by dividing the voltage drop across the entire transistor - resistor circuit by the current found in the resistor .",
    "the measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : temporal](b ) .",
    "the distance between the peaks in the two traces is 14 ns , indicating a very fast initial response to the impedance change .",
    "after 100 ns , the impedance had settled down to a constant value . by fitting the current signal beyond this time to an exponential",
    ", we extracted a time constant for the driver s response to small load changes of 70 ns .",
    "our laser diode current driver design , an improvement upon the hall - libbrecht design @xcite , has extremely good long - term stability , low noise , fast modulation response , and fast response to load impedance changes .",
    "the implementation of a digital set - point circuit and the use of modern surface - mount chips has resulted in more than an order - of - magnitude improvement in noise and stability .",
    "it also allows for extremely precise repeatability , high accuracy , and the ability to control the current set point remotely without degrading the performance of the current driver .",
    "the device out - performs any commercial device we are aware of , yet is simple and inexpensive enough to be used as a `` lab standard '' for both highly sensitive as well as less sensitive diode laser applications ."
