    "in the quantum information and communication community , studies of the properties of quantum entanglement and entanglement measures are mainly motivated by the idea that entanglement is a vital resource for processing quantum information .",
    "of particular current interest is the quantification of the entanglement present in many - body quantum systems for which experimental measurement protocols have been recently proposed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study the entanglement that can be extracted from bipartite projections of the ground state of the integrable repulsive lieb - liniger model on a ring @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian describes a continuous one - dimensional gas of bosons with short - range interactions modeled by dirac delta - functions .",
    "though these one - dimensional systems have long been studied in atomic waveguides with tight axial confinement @xcite , the ring - shaped traps needed to reproduce periodic boundary conditions have only been recently developed @xcite .",
    "the main objective of our work here is to study the effects of the strength of interactions on the entanglement obtained from projections of the ground state of this continuous many - body system  an aim that is facilitated by the fact that the lieb - liniger hamiltonian is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz .",
    "in fact , the entanglement entropy in other continuous integrable systems , for example the calogero - sutherland model @xcite and the anyonic lieb - liniger model @xcite , has already been studied under the framework of particle partitioning , but as we explain in the following paragraphs our extraction procedure involves a spatial partitioning of subsystems .",
    "more recently , the von neumann and rnyi block entropies in the ground state of spatially continuous free - fermionic models @xcite were obtained from conformal field theory arguments as the appropriate limit of the corresponding lattice model results @xcite .",
    "although there is as yet no conventional approach to quantifying the amount of entanglement in multi - particle assemblies of indistinguishable particles @xcite , the type of projections we consider here allows us to give a definite measure of entanglement in the resulting projected states via the von neumann entropy . in such indistinguishable particle systems ,",
    "entanglement between two spatial partitions of the system may both arise from the correlation in occupancies of the partitions , as well as the correlation between distributions of the particles in the two partitions .",
    "for example , occupancies of two boxes , by a total number of two indistinguishable bosons can be of the form @xmath0 , denotes the state having @xmath1 particles in one box and @xmath2 in the other . ] and there is entanglement in this state by virtue of the uncertainty of the number of particles in each box .",
    "if one can somehow eliminate this form of ( somewhat trivial ) entanglement , then does one still retain any entanglement between partitions in a system of indistinguishable particles ?",
    "we will show below that the answer to this question is `` no '' for free bosons , while it is `` yes '' for free fermions , providing a striking qualitative difference in the cause of the entanglement in these systems .    in this paper , we are interested in quantifying the entanglement in projections of the lieb - linger ground state that are obtained after coarse - grained measurements reveal the number of particles in one of two contiguous partitions @xmath3 and @xmath4 that divide the gas into two half - rings .",
    "thus , the projected pure state is spatially partitioned ( bipartite ) and one can quantify the resulting entanglement by the von neumann entropy . a similar procedure has been used to quantify the entanglement extractable from stationary and non - stationary states of impenetrable boson gases @xcite , supersinglet states , and several spin chains @xcite . in the spirit of these latter works",
    "we study here the notion of a projectively extractable pure state entanglement @xmath5 as defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the probability of projecting the ground state into a state @xmath8 having the fraction @xmath9 of particles in region @xmath3 and @xmath10 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath11 .",
    "that is , if @xmath12 is a projector onto the state subspace having @xmath13 particles in partition @xmath3 , then the projected ket we are interested in may be expressed as @xmath14 in terms of the ground state ket @xmath15 .",
    "the entanglement measure above gives the maximum weighted entanglement @xmath16 over all possible projection outcomes and consequently captures the probabilistic nature of the preparatory measurements .",
    "our analysis begins in sect .",
    "[ bethe ] with a brief introduction to the coordinate bethe ansatz that forms the basis of our exact computations .",
    "the probability of obtaining each projection outcome is calculated in sect .",
    "[ probsect ] , while the von neumann entropy of the projected states and their corresponding weighted entanglement are given in sect .",
    "[ vnesect ] . on the basis of these results",
    "we argue that the projectively extractable pure state entanglement @xmath5 is equal to the weighted entanglement @xmath17 of the balanced case in which exactly half of the bosons are present in both partitions ( the total number @xmath18 is given to be even ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that the extractable entanglement @xmath5 increases monotonically with interaction strength and saturates to its impenetrable boson value .",
    "we conclude with a summary and some remarks in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",

    "are equal to @xmath58 while in the tg limit we expect this distribution to be peaked and centered about @xmath45 for a fixed large @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , at these two extreme limits the most probable result of the projective measurement is the balanced bipartite state @xmath59 .",
    "since there are no critical values of @xmath60 , we do not expect this trend to change for arbitrary finite repulsion strengths and we argue that the balanced projection is the most probable outcome for all non - negative values of @xmath51 .",

    "black tick marks denote the corresponding values in the impenetrable boson limit.[entanglement ] ]    since free bosons condense in the ground state , the kernel reduces to a constant when there are no interactions and the only eigenvalue of the resulting reduced density matrix is unity .",
    "thus , there is no entanglement when @xmath46 . for any non - zero contact repulsion between @xmath18 bosons , however , there are @xmath80 distinct ways of choosing the components of the vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from the observation that the plane waves @xmath83 are linearly independent and square - integrable on the support @xmath3 we conclude that the reduced density matrix @xmath77 has at most @xmath80 non - zero eigenvalues .",

    "the eigenvalue problem can be solved analytically by linear algebra methods for small values of @xmath18 , but becomes increasingly cumbersome for large @xmath18 .",
    "this difficulty arises because the projected wavefunctions no longer have the convenient structure of the ground state bethe ansatz , that is , the projected states are excited and the dimensions of the reduced density matrix scale exponentially with particle number .",
    "a numerically exact evaluation of the von neumann entropy is shown in fig .",
    "[ entanglement ] for two , four , and six bosons . for the balanced cases",

    "[ entanglement ] we show that we can extract more entanglement from the balanced projection than from any of the unbalanced cases for @xmath35 and any @xmath51 .",
    "this fact is supported , but not rigorously proven for arbitrary @xmath18 , by our calculation in the previous paragraph of the upper bound for the von neumann entropy : @xmath87 or , equivalently , @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , for all the cases we have considered above the projected states @xmath89 are not maximally entangled , that is , @xmath90 . nevertheless , because of the preceding observations and the symmetry @xmath91",

    "the extractable entanglement @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "connecting lines serve to guide the eye.[unbalanced ] ]    so far we have argued that the projection probabilities and von neumann entropies are largest for the balanced projections @xmath45 at any given value of the repulsion strength .",
    "thus , according to the definition , the projectively extractable pure state entanglement from the lieb - liniger ground state is given by the weighted entanglement of the balanced fixed number projections , @xmath94 this statement is trivial for free bosons as we have already shown that the von neumann entropy vanishes in all possible projections for any even @xmath18 . in the opposite limit of impenetrable bosons",
    "this assertion is verified in fig .",
    "[ unbalanced ] where we give numerically exact results for all possible cases of up to six bosons . also apparent in this graph",
    "is a slower than linear increase in the extractable entropy @xmath5 with respect to the boson number @xmath18 .",
    "we also observe that although the probability of successful projection becomes smaller with increasing boson number , the von neumann entropy @xmath95 increases faster with @xmath18 so that the extractable entanglement @xmath5 increases with both repulsion strength and the number of bosons in the ring ( fig .",
    "[ eppfig ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for the few boson cases we have analyzed here , this increase is monotonic with respect to both @xmath18 and @xmath51 .",
    "hence , more entanglement can be extracted from these projections of the lieb - liniger gas in the tg limit of impenetrable bosons and we may regard the quantity @xmath5 as a probe of both quantum correlations and interparticle interactions in the ensemble of fixed number projections of the type we considered here .",
    "]    we have used the projectively extractable pure state entanglement @xmath5 to quantify the entanglement in coarse - grained fixed number projections of the lieb - liniger ground state .",
    "this entanglement measure quantifies the entanglement present in the set of all projection outcomes by giving the largest von neumann entropy weighted by the projection probability of a particular measurement result . in our case , this maximum corresponds to the most probable and most entangled projection having an equal number of particles in each half of the ring .",
    "we have seen in our numerically exact few particle results indications that the extractable entanglement increases monotonically with the strength of repulsion and with particle number . we have also observed that significant amounts of entanglement can be extracted by this projection procedure only in the strongly repulsive regime @xmath96 .",
    "this increase and subsequent saturation of entanglement with interaction strength @xmath51 has also been previously observed numerically in a few - particle lieb - liniger gas under the framework of single - particle partioning of the ground state @xcite .",
    "as the impenetrable tg limit corresponds to free fermions , our work reveals a fundamental difference in the origin of the entanglement present in bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "when fluctuations in partition occupancies are nullified by appropriate measurements , the entanglement of free - bosonic systems vanish , while for free - fermionic systems they remain non - zero . in the interpolation between the two cases , as is evident from figs .",
    "[ entanglement ] and [ eppfig ] , the free - bosonic behavior seems to last for @xmath51 nearly up to unity , before a rapid rise in entanglement is seen . a qualitative explanation of the difference found numerically in this paper is the fact that all bosons are exactly in the same state in the @xmath46 limit , so that no uncertainty remains as to their state in each partition once their number in the partition is determined . on the other hand , for free fermions , all states up to the fermi level will be occupied resulting in uncertainties ( entropies ) of the state in each partition even when the exact number of fermions in the partition is known .",
    "we expect these features to be preserved at larger particle numbers @xmath18 and ultimately present itself as an essential difference between a bose - einstein condensate and a fermi gas from the perspective of quantum information  a suggestion that is supported by our results and the observation that the lieb - liniger model has no density - controlled phase transition at any finite positive density .",
    "it is important to remark that the projected states we have described here are not eigenstates of the original lieb - liniger hamiltonian and will therefore evolve non - trivially in time .",
    "the results we present here are therefore only valid immediately after measurement while the spatial partitioning of particles is meaningful ; at arbitrary times after measurement the number of particles in each partition will display quantum fluctuations .",
