    "novel applications that employ laser - target interactions continue to emerge with the ongoing improvement of high - power laser systems  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a laser - irradiated target in a properly chosen experimental setup can serve as a source of gev electrons  @xcite , multi - mev protons and ions  @xcite , x - rays and gamma - rays  @xcite , and even copious positrons  @xcite . despite the seeming diversity of the applications ,",
    "there is a key unifying element : all of them require generation of energetic electrons by the laser . for that reason ,",
    "the dynamics of electron heating and acceleration remains an active topic of research  @xcite .",
    "the regime of laser interaction with the target electrons is greatly influenced by the density of the target .",
    "the interaction takes place only at the surface of the target if the density is over - critical , as in the case of solid density targets  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the laser beam is able to go through the target if the density is sub - critical , as in the case of gas jets @xcite .",
    "such low - density targets offer an extended interaction length with the laser , thus enabling a higher energy gain by the electrons .",
    "a sub - critical plasma layer can also naturally occur in experiments with solid - density targets where a significant pre - pulse is present .",
    "our interest in electron heating is motivated by experiments with solid - density targets on fast proton generation using pulses with duration of 1 to 5 ps  @xcite .",
    "a prepulse in these experiments can create a transparent preplasma , extending many wavelengths from the target surface along the beam path .",
    "the main pulse then interacts with a low - density plasma before reaching the target .",
    "it is important to understand if such interactions can generate hot electrons in addition to the ones produced at the critical surface  @xcite .    in order to address this issue",
    ", one has to consider laser interaction with a low - density sub - critical plasma .",
    "it is well known that the electron acceleration mechanism in this regime depends significantly on laser pulse duration . a laser - produced wakefield plays the dominant role when the beam is relatively short , with the duration shorter or comparable to the plasma wave period  @xcite .",
    "however , the wakefield mechanism becomes less efficient for longer laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "this would be the case for typical pulse durations used in experiments on fast proton generation . in the case of a long laser beam",
    ", its ponderomotive pressure tends to expel plasma electrons from the beam in the transverse direction  @xcite .",
    "the plasma mitigates this expulsion by generating a counteracting electric field via charge separation . as a result ,",
    "the laser can create a positively charged channel with a quasi - static transverse electric field evolving on an ion time scale .",
    "such channels and the corresponding transverse electric field are routinely observed in simulations of laser interactions with underdense plasmas  @xcite .",
    "an electron accelerated by the laser can become confined in the channel , oscillating across the channel while moving along with the beam .",
    "considerable acceleration of electrons has been observed experimentally in such channels  @xcite .",
    "although the plasma in these experiments was significantly underdense , the measured electron energies were much greater than the energy expected in a vacuum for a laser beam of the same intensity .",
    "the electric field of the channel clearly plays a critical role in enhancing the electron energy gain during its interaction with the laser pulse .",
    "several mechanisms that involve the transverse  @xcite or axial  @xcite field of the channel have been proposed as possible explanations for the enhanced electron energy gain .",
    "the region with a considerable axial field is typically located near the channel opening .",
    "its axial extend is much shorter than the length of the channel .",
    "the effect of the axial field can therefore be accounted for through initial conditions when analyzing electron dynamics over the length of the channel  @xcite .",
    "the focus of this work is on the role played by the transverse electrostatic field of the channel in enhancing the electron energy gain .    in what follows",
    ", we consider the dynamics of an electron irradiated by a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave in a two - dimensional steady - state ion channel .",
    "the main advantage of the two - dimensional setup is that for a given laser amplitude the amplitude of the laser electric field that directly drives the betatron oscillations can be changed by changing the laser polarization angle ( the angle between the laser electric field and the field of the channel ) .",
    "this allows us to examine the interplay between the electrostatic field of the channel and the oscillating electric field of the laser .",
    "it is shown that a considerable enhancement of the electron energy , which is predominantly associated with the longitudinal motion , requires a significant amplification of the betatron oscillations .",
    "our qualitative analysis indicates that there are two factors contributing to the amplification of the betatron oscillations : ( 1 ) the betatron oscillations can become parametrically unstable  @xcite , which would cause their amplitude to grow , and ( 2 ) the betatron oscillations can be directly driven by the laser field .",
    "the role of the two factors can be distinguished because the parametric instability is caused by modulations of the betatron frequency and it can develop in the absence of a driving electric field . the origin of these modulations is the non - inertial ( accelerated / decelerated ) relativistic axial motion induced by the linearly polarized wave .",
    "we find that the amplification of the transverse oscillations and the subsequent enhancement of the axial momentum occur regardless of the laser polarization .",
    "this result points to the key role played by the parametric amplification .",
    "we also find that the enhancement factor increases when the laser electric field and the field of the channel are collinear .",
    "it is plausible that this increase is linked to a nonlinear betatron resonance  @xcite , because the betatron frequency becomes comparable to the frequency of the driving field for the same range of parameters where the condition for the parametric resonance is satisfied .",

    "this enhancement is a result of the length contraction in an instantaneous inertial reference frame co - moving axially with the electron . in the case of a linearly polarized wave , the electron experiences alternating axial acceleration and deceleration caused by axial gradients of the wave pressure .",
    "therefore , the axial motion induced by the laser field not only significantly enhances , but also modulates the perceived ion density and , consequently , the restoring force from the ions .",

    "the restoring force increases with the increase of the laser intensity at a given ion density , which leads to more rapid oscillations across the channel for an electron with the same initial conditions .",
    "as @xmath140 approaches @xmath9 with the increase of @xmath116 , the time to traverse the channel becomes comparable to the period of the modulations of the restoring force .",

    "each modulation effectively provides a kick towards the axis of the channel . once the electron is kicked , it starts moving towards the axis , which means that the kick has occurred near the turning point . during the electron motion towards the axis , the restoring force drops because the time to traverse the channel is comparable to the period of the force modulations .",
    "the decrease of the force in combination with the extra momentum gained at the previous turning point allows the electron to travel further from the axis before experiencing the next kick .",
    "the situation repeats itself and each time the turning point moves further from the axis , indicating that the amplitude of the oscillations grows .",
