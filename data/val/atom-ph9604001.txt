    "the details are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the model consists of atoms with four energy levels , as outlined in fig .",
    "[ energylevels ] .",
    "level @xmath0 is the input pump level , level @xmath1 is the lasing level and level @xmath2 is the output level .",
    "level @xmath3 mediates the output coupling raman transition .",
    "there are two atomic cavities for confining atoms in states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one of these cavities , the lasing cavity , traps atoms in the level @xmath1 .",
    "only a single mode of this cavity becomes populated as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : equations ] .",
    "we wish to build up a large number of atoms in this ground state mode , in an analogous way to the standard optical cavity in a laser .",
    "the other cavity , the pump cavity , traps a large number of atoms in the internal metastable level @xmath0 .",
    "the two cavities are spatially overlapping , see fig .",
    "[ fiber ] .    initially the atoms are prepared in level @xmath0 , cooled and injected into the pump cavity .",
    "injection could be achieved by a number of methods .",
    "for example , a partially reflecting atomic cavity mirror could be employed .",
    "such atomic mirrors can be produced using the repulsive potentials created by blue detuned laser beams@xcite .",
    "the transmittivity of such a mirror may be very small for a practical cavity @xcite , however extremely large input fluxes of atoms are possible allowing useful numbers of atoms into the cavity .",
    "another possible input mechanism would be to inject the atoms into the cavity in a non - trapped atomic state and then employ a change of atomic state ( for example using a raman transition ) to the trapped state .",
    "this reverses our output coupling method .",
    "atoms change from the pump level @xmath0 to the lasing level , @xmath4 at a rate @xmath5 in the absence of bose - enhancement .",
    "atoms which make this change of level , however , do not necessarily become trapped in the ground state of the lasing cavity - the lasing mode .",
    "however the wavefunction overlap with this ground state is larger than the overlap with other higher energy states .",
    "tunneling losses out of this state are also lower .",
    "atoms that do transfer to the ground state of the lasing cavity are trapped , and so further transitions to this state will be enhanced by a factor of ( @xmath6 ) where @xmath7 is the number of atoms in atomic level @xmath1 and the ground state of the cavity . with suitable pumping of atoms into the system , a large number of atoms will build up in this single quantum mechanical state of the combined atomic and cavity system .",
    "for the parameters considered in this paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] ) other higher energy modes of the cavity state are not significantly populated .",
    "a raman transition couples atoms out of the system .",
    "two lasers transfer the atoms from level @xmath1 to a final atomic level @xmath8 .",
    "the lasers are confined to the lasing cavity , and are shone diagonally across the cavity so that they are counter - propagating in one direction ( the longitudinal direction ) and co - propagating in the transverse direction , fig .",
    "[ fiber ] .",
    "thus a momentum kick is imparted on atoms in the longitudinal direction , but no net momentum kick occurs in the transverse direction .",
    "the longitudinal momentum kick pushes the atoms out of the interaction region .",
    "if the rate at which atoms leave the system due to this kick is much larger than the raman transfer rate then we have an effective irreversible transfer of atoms from the lasing mode out of the system .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] we present an implementation of the scheme using a hollow optical fiber to create the transverse confinement for the atoms , and focussed laser light to form the longitudinal atomic mirrors . for a fiber with a hole of diameter",
    "@xmath9 it is appropriate to model the confining potential in the transverse direction as a harmonic oscillator potential . in the longitudinal direction we model the confining lasers for the pump cavity as a square well , and those of the lasing cavity as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "one possible problem with coupling the pump and lasing cavity by spontaneous emission is photon reabsorption .",
    "a simple argument suggests that reabsorption might reduce the number of atoms in the ground trap state .",
    "however , cirac and lewenstein @xcite have shown that under certain conditions reabsorption may increase the number of atoms in the ground state .",
    "moreover , reabsorption can be circumvented by ensuring that the lasing cavity is smaller than the mean free path of a photon , as suggested by spreeuw _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "hollow optical fibers with hole diameters comparable to the photon wavelength achieve this .",
    "atoms enter the system from a cooled thermal source .",
    "the initial cavity is produced using atomic mirrors for atoms in the metastable level @xmath0 .",
    "we consider an initial rate of atoms entering this cavity which we call the pump rate,@xmath10 .",
    "the coupling between the pump and laser cavity occurs through spontaneous emission .",
    "the rate of transfer of atoms from the pump cavity to the lasing cavity depends both on this atomic transition rate , @xmath5 , and on the average wavefunction overlap between the modes of the pump cavity and the lasing cavity .",
    "the average overlap between the pump cavity and the @xmath11th mode of the lasing cavity , @xmath12 , is equal to the sum over all the pump cavity states of the probability of finding an atom in that state , multiplied by the overlap between it and the @xmath11th energy state of the lasing cavity , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of atoms in level @xmath0 in any pump cavity state .",
    "@xmath15 is the value of the wavefunction overlap between the @xmath16th energy state of the pump cavity and the @xmath11th energy state of the lasing cavity , as outlined in the appendix .",

    "@xmath17 is the number of atoms in the @xmath16th pump cavity state .",

    "the lasers are oriented as discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : implementation ] , the @xmath33 direction is the longitudinal fiber direction , so that the atoms are pushed out of the fiber .",
    "the lasers are on resonance with the raman @xmath34 transition .",
    "they are far detuned from the @xmath35 and @xmath36 resonances to reduce excitation to level @xmath3 .",
    "the raman transition from level @xmath1 to level @xmath2 has a transition rate that depends on the rabi frequencies , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , of the two lasers for their respective transitions @xmath39 and @xmath36 .",
    "this rate also depends on the detuning of the two lasers from level @xmath40 .",
    "this transition rate can be found from scattering theory @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the detuning and @xmath43 is the time scale on which atoms are irreversibly lost from the system due to the momentum kick .",
    "@xmath44 is then the single atom loss rate from the system .",

    "@xmath43 is estimated by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mass of the atom , @xmath49 is the length of the light - atom cavity interaction region in the @xmath33 direction and @xmath50 is the size of the momentum kick . to transfer the population out of the system",
    ", we consider a regime where the loss rate out of the interaction region , @xmath44 is larger than the raman transition rate from level @xmath2 back to @xmath1 . in this regime effectively",

    "( [ r24 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath53 is a bose - enhancement factor for the backward process , due to the lasing mode having an occupation of @xmath7 bosons .",
    "here we have ignored the transitions into other higher energy modes of the lasing cavity , as in practice we find that only the ground state ( @xmath54 ) mode has a significant non - zero population .",
    "we require a coherent transfer of the population from level @xmath4 to level @xmath2 for our atom laser output . to ensure that the transfer is unitary we require negligible spontaneous emission from level @xmath3 .",
    "more specifically , we require that the rate at which atoms populate and then spontaneously emit from level @xmath3 is much less than the rate at which atoms leave the system coherently , @xmath55 .",
    "this constraint is given by @xmath56 we have only considered in this expression the population of @xmath57 due to atoms in level @xmath1 .",
    "the population due to level @xmath2 atoms is negligible compared to this , as the number of atoms in state @xmath2 is always small , ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : equations ] ) . in the physical implementation",
    "discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ r24 ] ) for @xmath52 using values that satisfy constraints ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) .    in the discussion above we assumed that the lasers impart a fixed momentum kick of magnitude @xmath58 to the atoms .",
    "this assumption corresponds to modelling the lasers as plane waves .",
    "atoms undergo a raman transition , absorbing a photon from one of the beams and emitting into the other . in a plane wave model of the lasers ,",
    "the final state of the atoms in the longitudinal direction will correspond to the initial wavefunction in the ground state of the lasing cavity combined with the momentum kick @xmath58 . in the transverse direction ,",
    "the output state of the atoms remains the ground state mode of the hollow optical fibre .",
    "this is achieved using output coupling lasers with a sufficiently narrow linewidth compared with the separation of the lasing cavity transverse energy levels . by suitably tuning such raman lasers to the output atomic level it is impossible for the atoms to excite into a higher transverse mode of the fiber , as the energy required to change internal atomic levels and excite the atoms to a higher transverse mode is higher than the available energy from the raman photons . for a fiber",
    "approximately @xmath59 in diameter this requires the raman lasers to have a linewidth of only a few khz , which can be achieved by active stabilization .    in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "the output atoms in state @xmath2 are no longer trapped .",
    "the atoms couple to a continuum of momentum eigenstates .",
    "since the initial wavefunction is an energy eigenstate of the lasing cavity the atoms do not have a definite momentum , due to the position - momentum uncertainty principle .",
    "hence , when the atoms leave the trap they have a momentum distribution with some width @xmath60 . for our parameters",
    "this width is smaller than the longitudinal momentum imparted to the atoms , @xmath58 .",
    "based on the time - energy uncertainty relation we expect the output linewidth to be narrower for slower output coupling .",
    "we can obtain an upper bound for the output width by considering fast output coupling .",
    "by fast we mean that the internal state of the atom is changed without time for the spatial wavefunction to evolve .",
    "then the spread in momentum due to the presence of a momentum distribution in the cavity is identical to the momentum spread one would obtain from a pulsed atom beam created by removing the walls of the cavity as suggested by guzman _",
    "_ @xcite .    for the parameters considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] , the longitudinal kick is of the order of @xmath61 , in comparison to the momentum spread of the atoms in the lasing mode of length @xmath59 of @xmath62 .",
    "a further factor which contributes to the final momentum spread of the atomic beam is the shape of the raman laser beams .",
    "we can estimate the size of this spread by considering a gaussian laser beam focussed down to a waist of size @xmath63 .",
    "this corresponds to focussing onto an interaction region of the size of the laser cavity that we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] .",
    "the gaussian transverse wavevector spread has standard deviation @xmath64 .",
    "thus the lasers impart a range of kicks which is somewhat smaller than the spread in the momentum in the cavity , @xmath65 .",
    "we can further decrease this spread by increasing the beam waist .",
    "this , however , increases the size of the interaction region , eventually invalidating inequality ( [ condition1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , even when it is invalid , some atoms will continue to couple out of the system .",
    "the atom laser discussed here contains analogous elements to those found in the optical laser .",
    "one of the differences is in the pumping process . here",
    "our pumping consists of the loading of the pump cavity . in an optical laser , pumping involves exciting atoms which then emit photons .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the inability to create atoms in a manner analogous to creation of photons .",
    "instead , atoms must be transferred from different states to the lasing state .",
    "another difference is that the output coupling of our atom laser also involves changing the state of the atoms .",
    "one important characteristic of the optical laser that is observed in our atom laser model is the presence of a threshold condition .",
    "this threshold condition occurs in an optical laser when the net amplification between the mirrors for a single photon circulating the cavity equals the loss at the mirrors .",
    "similarly for the atom laser threshold , we consider atoms injected into an otherwise empty system ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the threshold condition occurs when the single atom input rate into the lasing cavity , @xmath67 , is just sufficient to dominate the loss rate , @xmath52 .",
    "we thus expect a threshold when @xmath68 .",
    "the threshold condition can be expressed in terms of the injection rate into the pump cavity , @xmath10 , using the fact that for the empty system considered for the onset of threshold , @xmath69 at steady state .",
    "this gives the threshold condition in terms of the rate of input into the pump cavity as @xmath70 .",
    "we now present rate equations for this atom laser scheme .",
    "similar equations have been investigated independently by spreeuw _",
    "et al_. in the context of another atom laser scheme . in the regime where all the atoms that transfer to level @xmath2 are lost from the system ,",
    "we find that our rate equations reduce to a form equivalent to those of spreeuw _ et al .",
    "_ , though the overlap factors @xmath12 , and rates , @xmath5 and @xmath10 in our equations are different due to physical differences between the schemes .",

    ", we consider a spontaneous emission kick from the @xmath115 which corresponds to an infrared transition . modeling a lasing cavity placed at the edge of the pump cavity , @xmath116 ,",
    "we calculate the average overlap for a spontaneous emission kick of magnitude @xmath117 to be @xmath118 .",
    "the overlaps , @xmath12 with the higher exited states ( @xmath119 ) are smaller , with the next greatest overlap , @xmath120 occuring with the state @xmath121 , @xmath122 . in the analysis leading to fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] we use these values , and consider the six lowest energy states of the lasing cavity .",
    "all of these apart from the first are found to have negligible population in steady state because of their weaker overlap with the pump cavity modes , and due to the bose - enhancement of transitions into already populated states . in the rate equations we also use an atomic transition rate , @xmath5 , given by the inverse lifetime of the initial atomic level , @xmath0 .",
    "for definiteness we assume that @xmath123 , corresponding to @xmath0 being metastable .",
    "the output coupling is achieved by shining two lasers diagonally across the lasing cavity .",
    "this has the dual purpose of localizing the interaction region , as well as providing a total momentum kick , @xmath124 , directed along the longitudinal axis of the optical fiber ( the transverse components cancel ) .",
    "the atoms move out of the interaction region due to the momentum kick , thus forming the atom laser beam . for definiteness",
    "we arrange a value of @xmath125 .",
    "this value could be achieved using lasers with wavelengths @xmath126 oriented at @xmath127 to the long axis of the fiber .",
    "it is possible to produce light of this wavelength with a frequency doubled titanium - sapphire laser .",
    "assuming a typical atomic mass @xmath128 and size of the interaction region , @xmath129 , we find that the timescale on which atoms leave the system due to the momentum kick is given by eq .",

    "if state @xmath3 has a linewidth of @xmath132 then both constraints ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) can be satisfied with the output lasers detuned by an amount , @xmath133 and rabi frequencies , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . with these values the single atom rate",
    "constant , @xmath52 is given by eq .",

    ". the total rate at which atoms leave the system as the atom - laser beam is then given by @xmath55 .",
    "we do not propose a particular atom in which our level scheme might be implemented .",
    "one possibility is to use a metastable , rather than a hyperfine , level for the output state @xmath2 .",
    "atoms with two accessible metastable levels , for the pump state @xmath0 and the output state @xmath2 , include manganese .",
    "in this work we have analyzed an atom laser model and calculated values for the lasing population using an implementation of the scheme based on hollow optical fibers .",
    "we have proceeded by analogy with the photon laser and have described a device that will produce a large number of atoms in a single atomic state and a method of coherently coupling a beam of atoms out of this device .",
    "we found that the output energy spread is bounded by the momentum spread of the atoms in the lasing cavity .",
    "since the spread in momentum introduced by the raman lasers is smaller than the lasing cavity spread , the raman output coupling gives an output spectral density similar to that produced by dropping the walls of the cavity .",
    "this is because an atom making the raman transition changes to a non - trapped state where the atom is no longer affected by the confining potential .",
    "an important advantage of the raman scheme over switching the cavity walls is that atoms can be let out continuously .",
    "moreover , the raman transition gives the atoms a longitudinal momentum kick .",
    "other atom laser schemes @xcite have found large output linewidths due to collisions .",
    "this may increase the linewidth of our atom laser , though as our linewidth is already broad we do not expect this to be a limiting factor and have not considered this in our model . a criticism that has recently been made of a number of atom laser schemes",
    "@xcite is the lack of consideration given to inelastic collisions .",
    "such collisions are used explicitly in a number of models @xcite to provide the transitions to the lasing mode .",
    "we assume large blue detuning to minimize the excited state population due to the confining light .",
    "this minimizes the interatomic interactions in the lasing cavity .",
    "the raman transition scheme of hope and savage @xcite for generating mechanical potentials provides a method for further reducing spontaneous emission .",
    "we have presented an atom laser model , discussing input and output coupling mechanisms as well as a possible implementation of our scheme in hollow optical fibers .",
    "we found that for reasonable parameters we get a large build up of atoms in the lasing mode , above a threshold pumping rate , in a manner analogous to the threshold found in optical lasers .",
    "the authors would like to thank dr .",
    "j. eschner for his many helpful discussions .",
    "the overlap , @xmath15 between an atom in the @xmath16th state of the pump cavity and the @xmath11th state of the lasing cavity is given by      where the domain of the @xmath138 space integrals is a spherical shell of radius @xmath139 .",
    "this accounts for the spontaneous emission of a photon with wavevector @xmath138 of magnitude @xmath139 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that spontaneous emission is isotropic .",
    "other emission distributions are found to give similar overlap results for a particular @xmath139 . @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the wavefunctions of atoms in the @xmath16th and @xmath11th energy states of the pump and lasing cavity respectively .",
    "the lasing states are modelled in this paper as the eigenstates of three dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "the transverse mode structure of the pump cavity is likewise modelled as harmonic oscillators , while the longitudinal states are eigenstates of a square well .",
