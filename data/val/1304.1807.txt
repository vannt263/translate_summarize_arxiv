    "elucidating the mechanism of entropy production and early thermalization leading to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation is one of the fundamental problems posed by the phenomenological analyses of the experimental data obtained from the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . as hydrodynamics is only applicable after local thermalization has occurred , massive entropy production is a basic ingredient for any detailed understanding of the time - evolution of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "analyses based on ideal relativistic hydrodynamic equations suggest that thermalization should be achieved in an early stage in order to explain the rhic data .",
    "the thermalization time is estimated to be @xmath0 @xcite , which is significantly shorter than the equilibration time obtained in perturbative qcd @xcite . if @xmath1 were much longer , one would have to expect that significant artifacts caused by incomplete thermalization could affect many interpretations of the experimental data .",
    "the `` early thermalization '' of the created matter should be explained on the basis of the underlying dynamics of the time - evolution of the matter created in the nuclear collision .",
    "this remains a major challenge of relativistic heavy ion physics .",
    "apart from the time - evolution dynamics , peculiar fluctuations in the _ initial conditions _ are also recognized to be an important ingredient for understanding the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark gluon matter , in particular , the elliptic and triangular flows @xcite .",
    "classical yang - mills ( cym ) field theory is a good starting point for describing the initial stage dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions . at high energies , wee partons with small bjorken",
    "@xmath2 are excited , and the number of gluons in the small @xmath2 region is so high that they may be treated as a coherent or classical field @xcite . a classical solution of gluon fields in this regime is known : a nucleus at high energy can be regarded as a collection of large-@xmath2 particles , the valence partons , which act as color sources that give rise to strong , transversely polarized chromo - magnetic and -electric fields .",
    "this configuration of the gluon fields is referred to as the color glass condensate ( cgc ) .",
    "when two nuclei collide , their gluon fields interact and produce new , longitudinally polarized fields that extend between the color sources in the direction of the beam axis .",
    "field configuration is used as a standard initial condition for the time evolution of the matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is generally expected that some field instabilities could cause early thermalization ; such instabilities include the weibel instability @xcite and nielsen - olesen instability @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the instability gives rise to an exponential growth of the amplitude of unstable modes having high energy , which are expected to cascade into a large number of modes or particles with small energies due to the nonlinear coupling of fields , until the fields are thermalized .",
    "there are two facets in thermalization of cym .",
    "the first aspect is the isotropization of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the approximate isotropization is the minimal condition to apply hydrodynamics , and has been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the second is the equilibration of the spectrum toward the bose - einstein and the fermi - dirac distribution of gluons and quarks , respectively .",
    "while the spectrum equilibration provides for a more rigorous definition of thermalization , it has not been discussed seriously so far in cym .",
    "one reason for this may be that classical field theories do not generally exhibit the correct equilibrium spectrum by themselves .",
    "when equipartition of energy is realized in classical equilibrium , high momentum components are favored compared with the quantum equilibrium , i.e. the bose distribution . in the thermalization scenario described in the previous paragraph , we expect the produced particles to show quantum equilibrium spectra .",
    "thus the very thermalization mechanism is attributed to this conversion process but it is a difficult and unsolved problem to describe non - equilibrium and non - uniform situations in terms of nonlinear classical or quantum dynamics .      a central task to reach an understanding of early thermalization is to identify the mechanism of entropy production , which has been scarcely touched upon so far in the literature .",
    "it is to be noted that the high occupation probability of the unstable modes makes possible a quasi - classical treatment of the thermalization process in the initial stage .",
    "furthermore , kunihiro , mller , ohnishi , and schfer @xcite noticed that the use of the husimi - wehrl entropy @xmath3 , the wehrl entropy  @xcite defined in terms of a smeared wigner function ( the husimi function )  @xcite , is meaningful in the quasi - classical regime and showed that @xmath3 grows at the rate of the kolmogorov - sina ( ks ) entropy @xmath4 in the long - time limit .",
    "the fundamental origin of entropy growth induced by the husimi transformation is that even without an actual measurement the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle implies a minimum of coarse - graining .",
    "in other words : information which can not be measured in accordance with the uncertainty principle is de facto lost and information loss is equivalent to entropy growth .",
    "here the ks entropy is defined as a sum of the positive lyapunov exponents @xmath5 , @xmath6 the size of a lyapunov exponent @xmath5 is an indicator for the initial - value sensitivity of trajectories defined through the equation , @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 represents a small difference of phase - space variables at the initial time @xmath9 .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent means that the distance between the two phase space points grows exponentially in time .",
    "thus the entropy production in classical dynamics is closely related to the chaoticity of the system .",
    "it is therefore quite pertinent to investigate possible entropy production of the classical field itself to study the thermalization mechanism through its chaotic behavior in the glasma stage .",
    "in fact , the study of the chaotic properties of the classical evolution of yang - mills fields has a long history @xcite , initiated by the observation of chaotic behavior in the infrared limit of yang - mills theories @xcite , which was confirmed later for the compact lattice formalism of classical yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "some properties of lyapunov exponent and ks entropy in compact lattice gauge theories are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors analyzed the exponential growth of the distance between two trajectories for classical yang - mills evolution , starting from adjacent _ generic _ random initial gauge fields in the noncompact @xmath10 scheme .",
    "they calculated the ks entropy and found that the ks entropy is positive and finite even after a long time .",
    "the equilibration time scale @xmath11 was estimated to be around 2 @xmath12 for @xmath13 , though with rather substantial systematic uncertainties .",
    "this result obtained by starting from a generic random initial fields shows that a significant amount of entropy is produced by the dynamical complexity inherent in the cym equations , suggesting that thermalization in heavy - ion collisions can be at least partly be achieved in the classical regime before particle production comes into play as a quantum process .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was also observed that there are three distinct time regimes , namely a kinetic stage for short sampling times , an intermediate- and a long - time regime : i )   the short sampling time is characterized by the _ local lyapunov exponents _ ( lle ) .",
    "ii )  the evolution of the distance on ( long ) mixing time scales is described by the usual lyapunov exponents , which we refer to as _ global lyapunov exponents _ ( gle ) .",
    "it is to be noted that gles are equivalent to the original lyapunov exponents .",
    "iii )  in the intermediate - time period , the nonlinear coupling between different field modes is significant but the energy remains localized among the primary unstable modes .",
    "the lyapunov exponents characterizing the exponential growth of the separation of trajectories in this intermediate time period are called _ intermediate lyapunov exponents _ ( iles ) .",
    "we emphasize that the iles are the most relevant lyapunov exponents for the thermalization of the glasma , because they characterize the time - evolution of the strongly excited yang - mills fields in the early stage when the field configuration is still far away from equilibrium and a quasi - classical description of the dynamics of the yang - mills field is appropriate .      in this paper ,",
    "we extend the analysis done in @xcite and explore the thermalization process starting from more realistic initial conditions than those adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely glasma - like initial conditions .",
    "we analyze the time - evolution of the distance between two trajectories starting from two adjacent points in phase space and also extract the spectrum of lyapunov exponents from the time evolution of these fields . as was mentioned before",
    ", we can determine whether and how early entropy production is achieved by examining the number and magnitude of the positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "in this study , we use two glasma - like initial conditions .",
    "one is called `` modulated initial condition '' , where the initial color - magnetic fields @xmath14 are spatially modulated along the @xmath15 and @xmath2-axes .",
    "we call the other `` constant-@xmath16 initial condition '' . here",
    "both the gauge potentials @xmath17 and the chromomagnetic fields @xmath14 are constant , but non - commuting .",
    "it turns out that the two initial conditions give similar results for entropy production with some minor differences in the time evolution once the glasma - like initial conditions are taken .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the basic ingredients of our simulations including the initial conditions . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we show the numerical results for calculations starting from the modulated initial condition . from the time evolution of the distance between two trajectories which are very close to each other",
    "initially we determine the lyapunov exponents .",
    "we also show numerical results for simulations using the constant-@xmath16 initial condition in sec .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the equations of motion and the formulae needed for the analysis of chaotic behavior and the entropy production .",

    "note that all quantities in the equations are dimensionless , i.e. scaled with appropriate powers of the lattice constant .    from eqs .   and",
    ", we get the classical equations of motion ( eom ) for @xmath28 @xmath29 which we solve with glasma - like initial conditions to be specified later .",
    "a fourth - order runge - kutta method is adopted to solve these eom .",
    "it should be noted that we chose the initial condition such that it satisfies gauss law @xmath30 and check its validity carefully at every time slice .",
    "energy conservation is also checked for each time step .",
    "a natural indicator for the chaotic behavior of the system is the `` distance '' between two trajectories which start from slightly different initial points in phase space . with @xmath31 being the trajectory starting from an initial point @xmath32 in phase space ,",
    "we consider a second trajectory @xmath33 starting from an adjacent point .",
    "then we define the distance @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) between the electric fields ( the field strengths ) by @xmath36 respectively . here",
    "@xmath37 is the field strength tensor evolved from the initial point @xmath38 .",
    "these distances are gauge invariant under the residual gauge transformation of the eom , namely , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a function of gauge transformations in the adjoint representation which are independent of time .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are extracted from the time - dependence of these distances , as is described in the next subsection .",
    "for the two trajectories @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the tangent vector @xmath44 satisfies the following eom@xcite , @xmath45 where we have introduced a matrix defined by @xmath46    we call the matrix @xmath47 hessian , and the eigenvalues of @xmath48 _ for each time slice _ are referred to as the local lyapunov exponents ( lles)@xcite : as it stands , the lle plays the role of a `` temporally local '' lyapunov exponent , which specifies the departure rate of two trajectories in a short time period .    for a system",
    "where stable and unstable modes couple with each other as in the present case , an lle does not generally agree with the lyapunov exponent in a long time period . as an adequate way to characterize the exponential growth of the fluctuation , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite introduced another kind of lyapunov exponent @xmath49 called the intermediate lyapunov exponent ( ile ) , which is an `` averaged lyapunov exponent '' for an intermediate time period @xmath50 ; i.e. , a time period which is sufficiently small compared to the thermalization time but large enough to sample a significant fraction of phase space .    the explicit definition of a @xmath49 goes as follows : we first note that eq .",

    "two comments are in order , here : a lyapunov exponent can be ( real ) positive , negative , zero or purely imaginary .",
    "liouville s theorem tells us that the determinant of the time evolution matrix @xmath53 is unity , implying that the sum of all positive and negative iles is zero .",
    "the ks entropy is given as a sum of positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "the second comment concerns gauge invariance of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the discussion in the paper is centered on the time evolution of ks entropy which is the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents in cym .",
    "however , if the modes related to lle and ile are gauge non - invariant , the observed chaoticity does not necessarily have a physical meaning . in the appendix",
    "we show , however , that lle and ile are indeed gauge invariant under time - independent gauge transformations in the temporal gauge .",
    "our goal is to clarify how the entropy grows during the time interval when the gauge field configuration is still far from equilibrium but has already sampled a significant fraction of phase space .",

    "for the initial condition m - bf4 - 1 , the value of @xmath98 is about 0.23 at the initial time , drops slowly with time and finally settles around 0.12 at @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the ks entropy is surely positive definite even at late times , implying that the entropy is produced .",
    "a similar behavior is obtained for the initial condition m - bf4 - 2 which has an energy density about half of that of m - bf4 - 1 ; @xmath99 starts from a value around 0.15 , and the stable final value around 0.08 is reached at @xmath100 .",
    "the larger the energy density , the larger the value of the ks entropy . in the previous study , ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors found that @xmath99 scales as the fourth root of energy density , @xmath101 , for random initial magnetic fields .",
    "for the initial conditions m - bf4 - 1 and m - bf4 - 2 , the ratio of ks entropy , @xmath102 , is not so close to the fourth root of the ratio of the energy density @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "as the setting in this case is not isotropic , it is not clear that all dimensioned parameters should simply scale with powers of @xmath101 .",
    "it could also be that the volume studied here ( @xmath89 ) is insufficient for a reliable scaling analysis .    for the larger volume , m - bf8",

    "the spectra have the step - like structure similar to that from the modulated initial condition , except for the detailed structures . at later time",
    ", this discontinuity of the structure disappears and the spectrum becomes smooth .",
    "after about @xmath105 , the spectrum becomes stable , and again the fraction of positive iles is finite .",
    "the behavior on the @xmath87 lattice is quantitatively quite similar to that on the @xmath89 lattice , when the horizontal axis is rescaled by the total number of modes .",
    "comparison of the two cases we have studied , modulated and constant-@xmath16 initial conditions , which are chosen to mimic the glasma initial condition , reveals that the ile spectra at late times are quite similar : except for a few modes that remain very unstable ( @xmath106 ) in the case of the constant-@xmath16 initial condition , the largest ile s take values around 0.08 , and the modes at the @xmath107 percentile of all modes ( the @xmath108 and @xmath109 modes for the @xmath89 and @xmath87 lattices , respectively ) have iles around 0.01 . in both cases also",
    "a much larger fraction of all modes becomes unstable at late times than in the initial phase of the evolution .",
    "the agreement suggests that entropy production occurs in the cym dynamics for any glasma - like initial condition and that a large part of the entropy production is caused by the chaoticity of the gauge field dynamics manifested after some time , rather than by the instability of the specific gauge field configuration in the initial stage .",

    "we have studied the thermalization process of classical yang - mills fields starting from semi - realistic glasma - like initial conditions characteristic for relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we focused on the chaotic behavior and entropy production of the classical field theory .",
    "for this purpose we determined all lyapunov exponents for the theory discretized on a cubic spatial point lattice .",
    "the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents , i.e. the kolmogorov - sina entropy , gives the rate of entropy production .",
    "we considered two types of glasma - like initial conditions .",
    "one is the `` modulated initial condition '' , where initial chromomagnetic fields @xmath113 are spatially modulated along the @xmath15 and @xmath2 axes . in the absence of fluctuations , this field configuration is color - independent .",
    "the other initial condition is the `` constant-@xmath16 initial condition '' , where the gauge potentials @xmath114 and chromo - magnetic fields @xmath113 are both constant , but color - dependent , and only the @xmath15-component of the chromomagnetic field in one color direction is nonzero . for both types of initial conditions we added small random fluctuations to describe the noise present in the glasma fields due to the quantum fluctuations in the two colliding nuclei .",
    "we have found that when the gauge field is given by the modulated initial condition without any fluctuations , the distance between two trajectories starting from adjacent points shows oscillatory behavior and exponential growth is absent .",
    "when small fluctuations are present on top of the background field , the initial oscillatory behavior of the distance terminates after a short time and the exponential growth of the distance becomes robustly visible .",
    "the onset time of exponential growth depends on the ratio of the amplitude of the fluctuation to the strength of the chromomagnetic field .",
    "the fact that we do not see any exponential growth in the absence of initial fluctuations demonstrates that our numeric treatment introduces no fluctuations of relevant size .    for the modulated initial condition with small fluctuations positive lyapunov exponents are present from the beginning .",
    "this is a reflection of the unstable modes revealed in the linear response analysis of glasma fields .",
    "we found that the number of modes with positive lyapunov exponents increases substantially during time evolution , and that the lyapunov spectrum reaches a stable shape when a macroscopic fraction of the modes has positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "this implies that a bulk number of field modes contributes to the ks entropy and that the entropy production rate per unit volume is non - zero in cym .",
    "the dependence of the lyapunov spectrum on the size of the spatial volume is found to be weak if the mode number is rescaled by the total number of modes , which suggests that extensive entropy production occurs in the infinite volume limit in cym as first found by bolte _",
    ".    the chaotic behavior of cym with the noisy `` constant-@xmath16 initial condition '' is similar to that observed for the modulated initial condition with some modifications during the initial phase of the time evolution .",
    "after an initial increase of the distance accompanied with some oscillatory behavior , the distance shows an exponential growth , and the time evolution of the spectrum of iles shows a qualitatively similar behavior as that seen for the modulated initial condition .",
    "the number of positive lyapunov exponents is again found to be large , corresponding to many unstable _ bulk _ modes , and the entropy production rate grows approximately linear with volume also for the constant @xmath16 initial condition .",
    "the important conclusion to be drawn from our present analysis is that entropy production occurs in a robust way _ at the classical field level _ starting from semi - realistic initial conditions .",
    "while the classical field description of the glasma becomes invalid when thermal equilibrium is approached , the pre - equilibrium dynamics of the glasma can be simulated by classical gauge field equations , which allows to estimate the thermalization time .",
    "we therefore focused our study on the intermediate time regime , where the iles characterize the dynamical instability of the gauge field .",
    "our study suggests that the magnitude of the delay time before the start of linear entropy growth depends substantially on the chosen initial condition while the entropy growth rate itself is affected at most mildly . substantially more systematic studies are needed to decide whether there exist realistic scenarios for which the thermalization time is as small as 1 fm / c , which is the value advocated by the comparison of hydrodynamical simulations with heavy ion data .",
    "as the gauge field approaches equilibrium and quantum effects become important by providing a physical cut - off to the ultraviolet divergences of the classical thermal field theory , the evolution of the glasma can be described by viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the two effective theories of the dynamics of an equilibrating quark - gluon plasma can be directly joined or whether there is a need for an additional formalism interpolating between these two regimes .",
    "the calculations were performed mainly by using the nec - sx9 at osaka university .",
