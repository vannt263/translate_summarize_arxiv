    "the ion traps formed by space - charge distribution of the electron beam together with the electrostatic potential barriers at some length were intensively investigated in the 4060th years of the last century .",
    "the studies were caused by attempts to develop the system of ion focusing for microwave devices @xcite . in the first experiments ,",
    "ions were captured into the ion trap formed by the axially symmetric electron beam in the cylindrical drift tube with positive potentials applied to both sides of the trapping region @xcite .",
    "the processes of compensation of the electron beam were considered theoretically in works @xcite , which treated the captured ions as an ideal gas obeying the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , the theory of the space - charge compensation takes into account the singly charged ions only .",
    "the concept of using the ion trap for production of _ multiply charged ions _ was presented by e.d .",
    "donets in 1967 @xcite following work by p.a .",
    "redhead @xcite .",
    "the donets s invention was named the electron - beam method for production of ions . in 1968 ,",
    "the first experimental device based on this method was demonstrated .",
    "the ions of gold with charges of up to @xmath4 were successfully produced @xcite .",
    "the ion source received the name ebis ( electron - beam ion source ) .",
    "afterwards , the ion sources have been widely used around the world for more than 40 years @xcite .",
    "the specific applications of ion sources substantially affect their design ( in particular , the length of ion trap @xmath5 ) and the operation regimes .",
    "the first generation of devices was aimed at the extraction of multicharged ions for subsequent employment at accelerators . in this case , the length of ion traps was of the order of @xmath6 m @xcite . in 1988 ,",
    "the ion source with @xmath7 cm in the trapping regime ( without the ion extraction ) received its own name ebit ( electron beam ion trap ) was realized for the spectroscopical studies of the characteristic x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the small length of ion trap allowed one to suppress the problem of plasma instabilities .",
    "further breakthrough was associated with development of the ion sources without cryogenics @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of ion sources of such type is to control the axial behavior of ions in the electron beam by using the _ external _ electrostatic fields due to variation of potentials applied to different sections of the drift tube .",
    "accordingly , the drift tube should consist of at least three sections .",
    "although presently there is a variety of devices with different names , all the modifications employ the same method of multiple sequential ionization by the electron beam suggested originally by e.d .",
    "the argumentation of this method can be applied for the electron beam with constant radius only and , therefore , with the smooth bottom of the axial potential distribution . in the following sections",
    ", we shall consider the rippled electron beam , which creates its own local ion traps .",
    "if the period of undulation is significantly less than the length of the single drift tube , these local ion traps can not be controlled by the external electric fields in accordance with the donets s scheme .",
    "the rippled electron beam with the radius @xmath8 varying periodically from the maximum @xmath9 to the minimum @xmath10 creates a sequence of the local ion traps .",
    "the explanation of physical base for this type of ion traps is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the sag of the radial potential @xmath11 for the axially symmetric electron beam , which propagates along the drift tube with the radius @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath15 is the magnitude of the electron charge - to - mass ratio , @xmath16 is the potential of the drift tube relative to the potential of the cathode , @xmath17 is the perveance of the electron beam , and @xmath18 is the electron current . respectively ,",
    "the depth of the axial potential well @xmath19 is equal to the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22    as seen from eq .",
    ", for the smooth electron beam ( @xmath23 ) , the local ion traps do not appear ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "by contrast , for the rippled electron beam characterized , for example , by the ratio of radii @xmath25 , the current @xmath18 of 1 a , and the energy @xmath26 of 10 kev , the depth of the local potential well is equal to @xmath27 kv . thus it is possible to create an effective local trap in the rippled electron beam without any external electric fields .",
    "the length of the local ion trap @xmath5 along the @xmath28 axis is equal to half - length of the ripple wave .",
    "the value of @xmath5 depends on the accelerating voltage @xmath16 , the distribution of the focusing magnetic field @xmath29 , and the parameter of cathode conditions @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is defined as the ratio of the magnetic flux through the cathode with the radius @xmath31 to the magnetic flux through the cross section of the electron beam with the radius @xmath8 .",
    "this parameter is very important for the paraxial theory .",
    "whereas @xmath30 is varied between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the electron trajectories are changed significantly .",
    "the value @xmath34 corresponds to so - called the  brillouin s focusing system \" @xcite . in this case , the cathode of the electron gun should be located in the zero magnetic field . theoretically , for given magnetic field and the energy of electron beam , the extended brillouin s beam with constant radius acquires the highest current density @xcite .",
    "this property of the brillouin s focusing makes it very attractive for ebis .",
    "however , the practical realization of such electron beam focusing is rather difficult @xcite .",
    "extremely careful shapes both for the magnetic field and for the electron trajectories in electron gun are necessary to obtain the nonrippled beam .",
    "there is only one combination of the shape of magnetic field and the electron gun geometry , for which the electron beam can have the constant brillouin s radius .",
    "these are so - called the  brillouin s conditions \" @xcite . in all other cases ,",
    "the electron beam is rippled .",
    "generally , for arbitrary relationship between the magnetic field distribution and the electron trajectories , the thermal theory predicts formation of a sequence of images and crossovers @xcite . in the crossovers ,",
    "that is , in the local ion traps created by the rippled beam , the electron current density is many times higher than that in the case of the smooth brillouin s flow .",
    "therefore , new generation of the ion sources characterized by both small size and extremely high electron current density can be realized by using local ion traps in the rippled electron beam .",
    "a low capacity of the ion trap due to very short length of the device can be compensated by running in the mode with high repetition rate .",
    "in general case , the focusing of the axial electron beam in the magnetic field of a solenoid is the focusing of charged particles by a thick magnetic lens .",
    "the electron beam from the cathode at zero magnetic field is transformed into a sequence of the focuses in the regular magnetic field .",
    "since the first focus is the most acute , it can be called the _ main _ magnetic focus . in the next focuses ,",
    "the diameter of the beam increases successively under the influence of aberrations and nonlinear effects .",
    "a magnetically compressed electron beam was studied by k. amboss @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the electron beam damps out the undulations and looses the periodic structure within a relatively short distance .",
    "therefore , in the following , we shall take into account the magnetic lens for three focuses only .",
    "as an example , let us consider the electron beam with the current @xmath35 ma and the energy @xmath36 kev projected by cathode with the radius @xmath37 mm .",
    "the magnetic field has the short distribution @xmath29 , which allows to create three focuses .",
    "the electron trajectories in the focusing magnetic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in each focus",
    ", the local ion trap appears .",
    "the axial distributions of the electron current density are calculated over the region of each focus , namely , from the point @xmath38 mm to the point @xmath39 mm with the step of @xmath40 mm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the central point @xmath41 corresponds to the position of the highest current density in each focus .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of the electron current densities are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig6 ] for different magnetic fields at the cathode @xmath42 .",
    "for the zero field at the cathode , the first focus is acute ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , as it is predicted by the theory of the thick magnetic lenses .",
    "the structure of this focus is complicated .",
    "it exhibits all general features for focusing of the electrons emitted by the cathode with finite size .",
    "one can distinguish two groups of the electrons , which create two peaks , respectively .",
    "one part of the electrons is ejected from the central part of the cathode and generates the more acute peak .",
    "the second group of the electrons is emitted from the peripheral part of the cathode .",
    "the electrons are subjected to greater influence of the thermal velocity effects , aberrations of anode lens , and the distortion effects of the electric field in the gap between the cathode and focusing electrode .",
    "these effects give rise to the turbulence of the electron beam just in the first focus .",
    "the errors generated by the parasitic processes are accumulated very rapidly , so that the subsequent focuses lose their densities .",
    "the amplitude value of the electron current density in the second focus is less than that in the first focus by about factor of 10 .",
    "the density distribution in the third focus is negligibly small .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to achieve very high density in the second focus of the magnetic lens , if the defocusing processes are suppressed .",
    "the magnetic field at the cathode @xmath43 significantly alters the electron trajectories .",
    "just a slight magnetic field at the cathode suppresses some defocusing factors , namely , the effect of thermal velocities of electrons and distortion of the electric field near the boundary of the cathode . however , these positive effects cause also some losses of the electron current density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the distributions of the electron current density are shown for three focuses of the electron beam , if @xmath44 g. the maxima of the current density are decreased .",
    "the strongest peak is now located in the second focus @xmath45 .",
    "the electron current density along the @xmath28 axis is more close to the normal distribution . despite of some losses of the electron density ,",
    "the amplitude value of the current density in the second focus is high enough ( @xmath46  ka/@xmath47 ) .",
    "increasing magnetic field at the cathode up to @xmath48 g leads to further reduction of the maximum electron current density in the focuses of the electron beam ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . in the range of each focus ,",
    "the electron current density becomes more close to the normal distribution .",
    "the current density turns out to be more than 10 ka/@xmath47 on the length of about 0.3 mm .",
    "the values of the current density in different focuses are close to each other .",
    "the examples considered above show that it is possible to design the miniature device , in which the geometric factor of the rippled electron beam is used to confine the ions in the local ion traps .",
    "the electron current density can achieve extremely high values of the order of hundred ka/@xmath47 on the length of , at most , 1 mm .",
    "we shall refer to the device as the main magnetic focus ion trap ( mamfit ) , in accordance with definition of the most acute focus as the main one .",
    "the following two remarks should be pointed out here .",
    "firstly , the present consideration is performed for pure electron beam .",
    "since the ions prepared in the local ion traps compensate the space charge of electrons , the real electron current densities should be higher than those predicted in figs .",
    "[ fig4][fig6 ] . the ion focusing of the electron beam needs to be included in the model calculations .",
    "secondly , further increase of the magnetic field at the cathode leads to the system with magnetic compression of the electron beam .",
    "the main estimates for such system were done for the ebis krion-2 in dubna @xcite .",
    "this method of focusing makes it possible to obtain relatively smooth electron beam with high current density @xcite .",
    "the ion trap together with the system of ion extraction becomes the ion source .",
    "in particular , the mamfit is transformed into the mamfis ( main magnetic focus ion source ) .",
    "however , the standard method used for control over behavior of ions in the ion trap of the ebis , where the axial transport of ions is managed by the external electrostatic fields , is not feasible for the mamfis . the implementation of this principle would require to locate the drift tubes very close to each other . as a result ,",
    "the interelectrode space becomes too small initiating the voltage breakdown .",
    "since the electron beam makes the local ion traps by its rippled structure , the electron beam should change its form into the smooth one in order to allow the ion extraction . in this case , the potential distribution along the electron beam becomes also smooth , so that the ions can leave the local trap .",
    "practically , it can be realized , if the potential of the focusing electrode is switched over negative with respect to that of the cathode .",
    "then the pulsed electron beam is transformed into the smooth beam .",
    "although this method requires special shapes both for the electrodes of the electron gun and for the magnetic field , it allows the mamfis to run with high repetition rate",
    ". a very short time requisite for the ion confinement is provided by extremely high electron current density in the local ion trap .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the schematic structure of the three - focus mamfis , which corresponds to calculations presented in figs .",
    "[ fig3][fig6 ] , is shown .",
    "the electron beam has the current @xmath49 a and the energy of @xmath50 kev .",
    "the amplitude value of the magnetic field strength is about 4 kg .",
    "the trapping mode is realized , if the cathode potential is equal to the potential of the focusing electrode .",
    "when the potential of the wehnelt s electrode is less than the cathode potential , the electron beam becomes smooth and the extraction mode is switched on .",
    "the rough estimate shows that the confinement time for the production of highly charged ions in the electron beam with extremely high current density is sufficiently small @xcite . in addition",
    ", the length of the local ion trap is very short .",
    "accordingly , injection of the working substance into the ion trap as a pulse in accordance with basics of the ebis technology is either difficult or impossible . in particular ,",
    "it concerns light elements of the periodic table .",
    "we shall consider the preparation of high charge states in the local ion trap with _",
    "permanent _ pressure of the working substance .",
    "the standard ebis theory predicts that in this case the output spectrum should contain all ions of the working gas with the charges @xmath51 from @xmath52 up to some maximum value @xcite .",
    "however , in the plasma trapped by extremely dense electron beam , the phenomenon of  auto - cooling \" takes place .",
    "namely , the low charged ions of the working substance cool the highly charged ions of the same working substance . in other words , there is no need to add any special cooling gas , since the working gas cools itself . as a result , the equilibrium spectrum of ions turns out to be very narrow .",
    "it consists of highly charged ions mainly .",
    "this phenomenon is realized , because the neutral atoms and the ions with low charge states of about @xmath52 , which are generated continuously from the working substance , cool the highly charged ions accumulating in the trap .",
    "the ions in the middle charge states escape rapidly from the trap due to the process of  evaporative cooling \" @xcite .",
    "if the energy of incoming electrons is fixed , there is the limiting concentration of neutral atoms @xmath53 , in which the production of ions with the given charge state @xmath51 is still possible .",
    "the limiting concentration @xmath53 can be estimated from the condition of dynamical equilibrium between the electron loss and capture processes .",
    "if the radiative recombination is less probable than the charge exchange of multicharged ions on neutral atoms , the balance of rates for the ionization and the charge exchange is equivalent to the following equation : @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the concentration of ions in the charge state @xmath51 , @xmath56 is the ion velocity averaged over the maxwellian distribution , @xmath57 is the cross section for charge exchange of ions with neutrals , and @xmath58 is the single ionization cross section .",
    "complete consideration of this running mode will be presented in details elsewhere . as it follows from eq .",
    ", the limiting concentration is directly proportional to the electron current density @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in the local ion trap formed by very dense electron beam , highly charged ions can be produced in low vacuum .    in order to estimate the operation possibilities of the mamfis ,",
    "we have studied the charge state distributions and expected intensities for ions of xe , ar , and ne produced in the local ion trap by the electron beam with the current density @xmath60 ka/@xmath47 .",
    "the calculations are performed with the use of the computer code written in 1996 - 1999 years @xcite .",
    "the code takes into account two working substances with permanent pressures in the ion trap .",
    "one of the substances can be chosen as a residual gas , for example , hydrogen .",
    "this option allows one to simulate the ionization processes most closely to the experimental conditions .",
    "the parameters of the local ion trap used in the numerical calculations are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "l c|c l electron current @xmath61 & & & 0.1 a + electron energy @xmath62 & & & 10 kev + electron current density @xmath59 & & & 20 ka/@xmath47 + length of ion trap @xmath5 & & & @xmath40 cm + volume of ion trap @xmath63 & & & @xmath64 @xmath65 + total electron charge @xmath66 & & & @xmath67 @xmath68 + concentration of electrons @xmath69 & & & @xmath70 @xmath71 +      the simulation is performed for the permanent pressure of neutral xe of @xmath72 mbar with admixture of neutral hydrogen under the partial pressure of @xmath73 mbar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . the confinement time is chosen to be 10 and 30 ms .",
    "accordingly , the mamfis should run with the repetition rate @xmath74 of about @xmath75  @xmath76 hz .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by considerable suppression of the ion population in the middle charge states within the range @xmath77 , which actively participates in the process of  evaporative cooling \" .",
    "in addition , the part of highly charged ions is pronounced and relatively narrow .",
    "the yield of ions with charge @xmath51 can be estimated by using the following formula : @xmath78 taking the concentration of xe@xmath79 ions @xmath55 of about @xmath80 @xmath71 , the ionization volume @xmath81 @xmath65 , and the running frequency @xmath82 hz , one obtains the ion yield @xmath83 particles per second ( pps ) .",
    "this value is much higher than the intensities obtained with the use of the dresden ebis devices @xcite .",
    "the charge spectra of ar@xmath84 ions after their confinement in the local ion trap during 1 and 20 ms are depicted in fig .",
    "the estimates for the ion current are made analogously to that for the ions of xe .",
    "for example , after 1 ms the predicted yield of ar@xmath85 ions should be about @xmath86 pps .",
    "for the production of ar@xmath87 ions the confinement time is increased up to 20 ms .",
    "the corresponding estimate for the ion yield gives @xmath88 pps .",
    "for stepwise ionization of the light elements such as ne , the pressure of neutral gas in the ion trap can be increased . in the first computer simulation ,",
    "the permanent pressure of ne is fixed at the level of @xmath89 mbar .",
    "the admixture of residual hydrogen is also taken into account under the permanent pressure of @xmath90 mbar .",
    "the electron beam is characterized by @xmath49 a , @xmath60 ka/@xmath47 , and @xmath91 kev .",
    "the charge spectrum of ne ions after 1 ms of confinement is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . the ion yield of ne@xmath92",
    "is estimated as about @xmath93 pps , while the yield of ne@xmath94 ions is less by half .    in order to compare the influence of electron current density and vacuum on the charge spectrum of ne ions ,",
    "the second simulation is done for the electron beam with @xmath95 ka/@xmath47 and @xmath96 kev in vacuum of @xmath97 mbar . in this case , the ionization volume @xmath63 is of about @xmath98 @xmath65 .",
    "the background gas ( hydrogen ) is assumed to have the permanent pressure of @xmath90 mbar .",
    "the charge state distribution of ne ions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the confinement time is 1 ms .",
    "the yield of ne@xmath99 is estimated to be at least @xmath2 pps .",
    "obviously , the ions can be prepared for the confinement time even less than 1 ms .",
    "the theoretical estimates presented above confirm the well - known statement that the high electron current density is the key for effective production of highly charged ions .",
    "the pilot examples of the mamfis / t with the electron beam energies of 4 , 10 , and 30 kev are being tested by the method of x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the experimental results will be published elsewhere .",
    "the technology of magnetic compression of the electron beam from the cathodes with high emission density allows one to create the unique ion traps in crossovers of the rippled electron beam .",
    "the control over behavior of ions can be performed by changing the potential on the focusing electrode of the electron gun .",
    "the ion traps have the extremely high electron current density in crossovers and very short length .",
    "the latter gives one more advantage of the device , because it decreases the chance of instability of the dense electron beams .",
    "the mamfis is the compact ion source of new generation , which can be used for technological applications and scientific investigations in atomic physics , plasma physics , solid - state physics , single ion implantation , ion lithography , and others .",
