    "regularity is at the heart of position space ( block spin ) renormalization group .",
    "it is usually assumed , and of central importance , that coupling constants of the block spin effective hamiltonian depend in a non - singular way on the parameters of the original theory .",
    "there are , however , situations where this assumption is not valid .",
    "pathological behaviour in renormalization groups of the low temperature ising model was first observed by israel @xcite and griffith and pearce @xcite .",
    "an extensive and rigorous analysis of regularity properties and pathologies in ising model block spin transformations was performed by van enter et al .",
    "the central observation is that in certain situations the effective measure for the block spin theory can not be represented as @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the effective measure is non - gibbsian .",
    "see also @xcite for a careful analysis of the situation .",
    "in this paper , i present some numerical results on the distribution of zeroes in the complex @xmath1 plane for block spin boltzmannians of the 2d ising model .",
    "these boltzmannians are partition functions with `` fixed '' block spins @xmath3 , viz .",
    "b ( ) = _ p ( , ) .",
    "@xmath4 encodes the blocking rule .",
    "why should these zeroes provide interesting information ?",
    "if the usual renormalization group assumptions are true , the zeroes of @xmath5 should  for all block spin configurations @xmath3  behave `` better '' than those of the full partition function . note that the zeroes of the full partition function approach the real axis at the critical point @xcite .",
    "this should _ not _ happen for the zeroes of @xmath5 !",
    "furthermore , one might expect that the pathologies described in the literature are related to the distribution of zeroes close to the @xmath1 axis at large positive values .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 2 the model notation is set up , and the blocking rules are defined .",
    "section 3 gives a sketch of the transfer matrix technique used to compute the polynomials .",
    "section 4 summarizes the numerical results for the majority rule blocking .",
    "observations for the kadanoff blocking rule are reported in section 5 .",
    "conclusions follow .",
    "we deal with the 2d ising model , with partition function z = _ , where h()= - _ <",
    "i , j > _ i _ j . the @xmath6 assume values @xmath7 and are defined on a square lattice of extension @xmath8 by @xmath8 , supplied with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the energy @xmath9 is a sum over all pairs of nearest neighbours . in the infinite volume limit",
    "the model undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath10 .",
    "a block spin transformation with scale factor 2 is defined as follows . for @xmath8",
    "even , the lattice is divided in blocks of size 2 by 2 .",
    "given the configuration of the @xmath11-spins in a block @xmath12 , a block spin @xmath13 is chosen with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the majority rule is defined through p ( , ) = _ blocks i p_i(_i , ) , with p_i(_i , ) = \\ {    ll 12 & _ ii _ i = 0 , + 1 & _ i _ ii _",
    "i > 0 , + 0 & .    .",
    "the so - called kadanoff rule is [ kadanoff ] p_i(_i , ) = . in the limit @xmath14",
    "one recovers the majority rule .",
    "given that @xmath15 , the full partition function can be rewritten as z = _ b ( ) , with b ( ) = _ p ( , ) .",
    "usually , one aims at a parametrisation @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the effective hamiltonian .",
    "note , however , that this is impossible in the pathological situations discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "an exact computation of @xmath5 as function of @xmath1 seems impossible . however , on lattices up to at least @xmath18 it can be determined by numerical transfer matrix calculations .",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to 4 by 4 blocks , with @xmath19 block spin configurations @xmath3 .",
    "we do not have to consider them all .",
    "configurations connected through global spin flip or geometric symmetries ( reflections , shifts , rotations ) have the same effective boltzmannian @xmath5 . a careful counting yields for the number of non - equivalent configurations @xmath20    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] we show the zeroes for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , both for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "obviously , most of the zeroes in the neighbourhood of the critical circle do not move very much .",
    "in fact they are already very close to their majority rule values .",
    "however , compared with the @xmath25 case , extra zeroes appear that populate the region of larger real part of @xmath1",
    ". it might be interesting to note that the zeroes with the largest real part of @xmath1 belong to block spin configuration @xmath26 , followed by those of @xmath27 .",
    "another observation , also clearly seen in figure [ fig6 ] , is that the spurious zeroes move to the right when @xmath28 is increased .",
    "most likely they are shifted to infinity when passing to the majority rule .                in figure 7",
    "the zeroes of all three lattice sizes , @xmath21 , 6 , and 8 are plotted for the case @xmath29 . , some 16 of the 479 block spin configurations were not taken into account because the search for the zeroes of the corresponding polynomials suffered from numerical instabilities . ]",
    "a careful inspection reveals that the zeroes in the right half plane _ do _ move towards the real axis when the lattice size is increased .",
    "they might thus very well be reflecting the large @xmath1 pathologies .",
    "the distribution of zeroes of effective boltzmannians was studied for 2d ising systems .",
    "both in the case of the majority and the kadanoff rule a finite region around the critical point stays free of zeroes , also when the volume is increased . in case of the kadanoff rule , however , zeroes populate the right half plane and approach the real axis at large @xmath1 .",
    "they might be related to the pathologies of a number of ising renormalization groups discussed in the literature .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand this relation ( if it exists ) .",
    "furthermore , one should try to understand the origin of the extra zeroes that appear for finite @xmath28 .",
    "van enter et al .",
    "were not able to extend their analysis of pathologies to @xmath25 in two dimensions .",
    "the present study shows that the distribution of large @xmath1 zeroes changes significantly when @xmath28 becomes finite .",
    "the present findings do not , however , exclude the possibility of large @xmath1 pathologies of the 2d ising majority rule renormalization group ."
