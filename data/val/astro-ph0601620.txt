    "known as the warm  hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , this phase is predicted to contain roughly half of the baryonic matter at low redshifts @xcite .",
    "its extremely low density ( typically @xmath5 ) precludes the detection of whim thermal or line emission with current facilities , so the only way to directly measure these `` missing '' baryons is through far  ultraviolet and x - ray spectroscopic measurements of absorption lines from highly ionized heavy elements @xcite .",
    "several early attempts to detect these intervening whim absorbers in x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recent surveys @xcite yielded only tentative detections at best .",
    "intervening lyman  alpha @xcite and ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) absorbers had also been seen in  and hst quasar spectra , but their ionization states and possible galactic halo origins ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are quite uncertain .",
    "these uncertainties are largely mitigated with the recent detection by @xcite of two x - ray absorption systems at @xmath6 and @xmath7 along the line of sight to the blazar mrk 421 .",
    "these filaments account for a critical density fraction of @xmath8 , fully consistent with the mass of the missing baryons in the local universe ( albeit with large uncertainties ) . while future proposed missions such as _ constellation  x _ , _ xeus _ , or _ pharos _ ( nicastro et al . , in preparation )",
    "will be able to measure @xmath9 to far greater precision with detections of numerous weaker x - ray forest lines , the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n05 ) results present a key early confirmation of numerical predictions using observational capabilities that are _ currently _ within our grasp  hence any test of their correctness is of great importance .",
    "although each of these two absorption systems was detected with high confidence through multiple redshifted x - ray absorption lines , the _ individual _ absorption lines were generally quite weakly detected , mostly at the @xmath10 level . moreover , while they employed high  quality and  data taken during exceptionally bright outbursts of mrk 421 , the many archived  observations of this source were not included in the analysis . with roughly twice the effective area of /letg",
    ", /rgs is in principle superior for x - ray grating spectroscopy between @xmath11 ; however , its slightly worse resolution ( approximately 60m  fwhm , versus 50m  for /letg ) , higher susceptibility to background flares , and multitude of narrow instrumental features can present serious complications for whim searches .",
    "independent confirmation of the  results with a separate instrument like  is thus important . while some groups have searched for whim features in a limited number of  mrk 421 spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a complete and systematic analysis has yet to be performed . here",
    "we present a search for @xmath12 whim features employing all `` good '' observations of mrk 421 available in the   archive , and a comparison of these results to those presented by n05 .",
    "we searched the  archive for all mrk 421 reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) data .",
    "although 31 separate observations were available , 16 had pointing offsets @xmath13  while the rest were offset by less than 15 .",
    "since spectral resolution and calibration quality can degrade at large offsets , we only included those with @xmath14 .",
    "one extremely short observation ( 0158971101 , with @xmath15s ) was also excluded to simplify the data reduction process . using the standard  science analysis system version 6.5.0 routines , rgs1 light curves were built for the remaining 14 `` good '' observations ( see table  [ tab_log ] ) , and the spectra",
    "were reprocessed to exclude periods of high background levels and coadded .",
    "these combined , filtered rgs1 and rgs2 spectra have effective exposure times of @xmath16ks and over @xmath17 combined rgs1@xmath18rgs2 first  order counts between @xmath19  with @xmath1 counts per 0.06  resolution element in rgs1 near 21 , over twice that in the n05 mrk  421  spectrum .",
    "we first used the spectral fitting program _",
    "_ sherpa _ _ to fit a simple power law plus galactic foreground absorption model to the rgs1 and rgs2 data ; however , at such high spectral quality the rgs response model does not appear to be well  determined , and large residuals remained . for line measurements , we thus only considered @xmath20  windows around each wavelength of interest , using a power law to independently model the rgs1 and rgs2 continua within each window and excluding the strongest narrow detector features ( with typical widths of 70m  or less ) .",
    "none of the intervening absorption lines were apparent through a visual inspection of the  spectrum , though several of the @xmath21 lines reported by @xcite could be seen clearly .",
    "a narrow gaussian absorption line ( fwhm@xmath22m ) was included in the model for each line measurement or upper limit reported by n05 . when convolved with the rgs instrumental response",
    "these absorption lines appeared broadened to the rgs line spread function ( lsf ) widths ( typically fwhm@xmath23m ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath24 upper limits on all equivalent widths were then calculated ( allowing the central line wavelengths to vary within the @xmath25 errors reported by n05 ) . since the shapes of the rgs1 and rgs2 instrumental responses are quite different , these limits were calculated using both a joint fit to the rgs1@xmath18rgs2 spectra as well as the individual rgs1 and rgs2 spectra .",
    "it should be noted that wherever one rgs unit is unusable , the total response is effectively halved , at which point it has a similar effective area to /letg .",
    "the resulting equivalent width limits are listed in table  [ tab_ew ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_xmmspec ] shows the spectral windows used to determine upper limits on the n05 measured lines , with the data ( black ) , continuum fit ( blue ) ,  measurements and limits ( n05 ; red solid and dotted lines respectively ) , and  limits ( green ) overplotted . in all cases ,",
    "the n05 measurements ( or @xmath26 upper limits ) appear to be consistent with the @xmath24 upper limits we have derived directly from the  data , as shown in the figure and listed in table  [ tab_ew ] .",
    "the  line at @xmath7 looks as though it might be visible in the spectrum , but this is most likely due to the weak instrumental feature at @xmath27 . for two lines (  and  at @xmath7 ) the  @xmath24 upper limits are approximately equal to the n05 best  fit measurements , but since the n05 values are quite uncertain this result is still consistent .",
    "why , then , with @xmath28 times the counts per resolution element , was  unable to detect the intervening absorption systems seen by ?",
    "several factors appear to have been involved in this non  detection , primarily : ( 1 ) narrow instrumental features caused by bad detector columns , ( 2 ) the broader lsf as compared to /letg , and ( 3 ) fixed ",
    "pattern noise at long wavelengths :    1 .",
    "while broad instrumental features can be taken into account by modifications to the continuum model ( as in n05 ) , it is difficult or impossible to distinguish narrow features from true absorption lines ; thus , any line falling near one of the detector features shown in figure  [ fig_rgsmod ] can easily be lost .",
    "this was responsible for the non - detection of the @xmath6  k@xmath29 line .",
    "although it was the strongest line reported by n05 , its wavelength falls directly on a narrow rgs1 feature and within the non  functional ccd4 region on rgs2 , thereby preventing this line from being detectable with either rgs . since 18% of the wavelength space for studying redshifted",
    "( @xmath30 ) toward mrk 421 is directly blocked by these narrow features ( with this number climbing to about 60% if resolution elements immediately adjacent to bad columns are included ) , these bad columns present the single greatest hindrance to /rgs studies of the whim .",
    "2 .   even for lines",
    "where both rgs1 and rgs2 data are available and the instrumental response appears to be relatively smooth , the lower resolution of  contributes to the nondetectability of the weaker @xmath12 absorption lines .",
    "figure  [ fig_lsfplot ] shows the lsfs for both /rgs1 ( solid ) and /letg assuming an unresolved line with @xmath31m  at 21.6 .",
    "while the core of the rgs1 response is @xmath32% broader than that of the letg , the rgs1 lsf has extremely broad wings : only 68% of the line flux is contained within the central 0.1  of the rgs1 lsf , as opposed to 96% for the letg .",
    "this reduces the apparent depth of absorption lines by about a factor of two as compared to /letg , severely decreasing the line detectability .",
    "3 .   at long wavelengths ( @xmath33 )",
    "strong fixed ",
    "pattern noise is apparent as a sawtooth pattern in the instrumental response , strongly impeding the detection of species such as  and .",
    "indeed , in these wavelength regimes ( the lower two panels of figure  [ fig_xmmspec ] ) , the  and absorption lines are nearly indistinguishable from the continuum .",
    "we have presented the highest signal  to  noise coadded  grating spectrum of mrk 421 to date , incorporating all available archival data .",
    "this spectrum serves as an independent check on the recent detection of two @xmath12 whim filaments by n05 .",
    "while none of the detected absorption lines are seen in the  spectrum , the upper limits derived from the  data are consistent with the equivalent widths reported by n05 ( even though the  data contain a larger number of counts ) , and hence do not jeopardize the validity of the measurement . the non  detections can be attributed primarily to narrow instrumental features in rgs1 and rgs2 , as well as the inferior spectral resolution of  and fixed ",
    "pattern noise at longer wavelengths .",
    "this underscores the extreme difficulty of detecting the whim , illustrates how the aforementioned ( apparently small ) effects can greatly affect the delicate measurement of weak absorption lines , and re  emphasizes the importance of high resolution and a smooth instrumental response function for current and future whim absorption line studies .",
    "we thank the  team for their efforts on this excellent mission , the helpdesk staff for their assistance with the data reduction , and the anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
