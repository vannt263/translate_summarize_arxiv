    "the scenario of massive star formation remains unclear and has been observationally challenging because of large distances , clustered formation environments , and shorter evolutionary timescales of massive stars .",
    "ultracompact hii ( uchii ) regions are considered signposts of massive star formation , but do not represent the earliest stage of massive star forming process ( e.g. , churchwell 2002 ) .",
    "hot molecular cores are defined as compact ( @xmath4 0.1 pc ) , dense ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) and warm ( @xmath7 100 k ) molecular cloud cores ( kurtz et al .",
    "the observations from various wavelengths have suggested that hot cores are the sites for massive star formation , and that they represent the early phase of the evolution prior to uchii regions ( kurtz et al .",
    "2000 ; gibb et al .",
    "2000 , 2004 ; churchwell 2002 ) .",
    "so far only twenty or so hot cores from high - resolution observations have been reported in the literature .",
    "the observations of hot cores are important for understanding the evolutionary sequence and physical conditions of massive star formation .",
    "hypercompact hii ( hchii ) regions have smaller sizes and higher densities compared with uchii regions , and they probably correspond to a transition phase from hot cores to uchii regions .",
    "the hchii region g28.20 - 0.04n at a distance of 5.7 kpc has been observed at radio and millimeter wavelengths ( fish et al .",
    "2003 ; sollins et al . 2005 ; sewilo et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 ; keto et al .",
    "masers , rotation , inflow , and outflow in g28.20 - 0.04n have been revealed from observations of molecular and radio recombination lines at centimeter wavelengths ( argon et al .",
    "2000 ; menten 1991 ; sollins et al . 2005 ; sewilo et al .",
    "however , the star formation environment and physical conditions of the hot core in this region are still poorly understood .    due to the compact and dense nature of hot cores , high angular resolution observations using molecular lines with high critical densities and excitation temperatures at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths are crucial to uncovering the physical conditions and kinematics in g28.24 - 0.04n . in this letter , we present the submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of molecular lines at 1.3 mm toward the hot core in g28.24 - 0.04n .",
    "the data are from sma archive",
    ". observations toward g28.20 - 0.04n were carried out with the sma in september 2005 , at 220 ghz ( lower sideband ) and 230 ghz ( upper sideband ) with a frequency resolution of 0.4125 mhz and an angular resolution of 1@xmath8 .",
    "the mean system temperature was 100 k. in the database , qso 3c454.3 and uranus were observed for bandpass and flux - density calibrations .",
    "qsos 1743 - 038 and 1911 - 201 were also observed for the antenna - based gain corrections .",
    "the calibration and imaging were done in miriad .",
    "multiple lines were detected in both sidebands . using the task uvlin in miriad ,",
    "the continuum level was determined by a linear fitting to the line - free channels .",
    "then , the calibrated ( u , v ) data were separated for two output ( u , v ) data sets : the continuum and the continuum - subtracted spectral lines . in order to improve sensitivity , we smoothed the h30@xmath3 , co and @xmath1co lines to 2 km  s@xmath9 velocity resolution , and smoothed rest of the lines to 1 km  s@xmath9 velocity resolution .",
    "self - calibration was performed to the continuum data .",
    "the gain solutions from the continuum were applied to the line data .",
    "the synthesized beam size of the continuum and line images with robust weighting was approximately 1.3@xmath10 ( p.a.=@xmath11 ) .",
    "the molecular lines were identified using the cdms and jpl databases ( mller et al .",

    "the major axis of the line image is approximately 1.4@xmath8 , corresponding to a projected linear size of @xmath240.04 pc . in order to avoid the cancellation of the integrated intensities of the emission ( positive values ) and absorption ( negative values ) in the overlapping region along the line - of - sight",
    ", the emission and absorption in the co and @xmath1co were handled separately for the integrated intensity maps , as done by qin et al .",

    "figure 2 presents the spectra of the molecular line transitions .",
    "the spectra were extracted from the channel maps at the peak positions of the line images . in fig .",
    "2 , the emission spectra have similar profiles , showing single emission peak with similar line center velocity and line width .",
    "gaussian fits were performed on all the spectra . the peak intensity ( @xmath25 ) , full width at half maximum ( @xmath26 ) , and central line velocity ( @xmath27 ) from the gaussian fits",

    "absorption can be observed if the excitation temperature of gas in front of the background continuum is lower than the brightness temperature of the continuum .",
    "absorption is also observed in the co line .",
    "methyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0cn ) has been proved as an ideal probe to determine the kinetic temperature and column density of molecular gas ( e.g. , remijan et al .",
    "seven k - components of the ch@xmath28cn ( @xmath29 ) transition were detected by the sma observations . from the integrated intensities , in the limits of optically thin and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) ,",
    "the rotation temperature and column density are estimated using a rotation temperature diagram ( goldsmith & langer 1999 ; liu et al .",
    "figure 3 shows the rotation temperature diagram .",
    "a linear least - square fit is performed toward the seven ch@xmath0cn transitions .",
    "the derived rotation temperature and beam - averaged column density are 308@xmath2022 k and ( 1.6@xmath200.3)@xmath3010@xmath31 @xmath32 , respectively . in the orion molecular cloud ,",
    "the ch@xmath0cn transitions were only detected in the hot core and the compact ridge , giving fractional abundances relative to h@xmath2 of 7.8@xmath33 and 3.2@xmath34 , respectively ( blake et al .",
    "taking source size of 0.04 pc and the fractional abundance in the orion cloud , we inferred the h@xmath2 density of @xmath35 @xmath6 in g28.24 - 0.04n .",
    "the relatively higher gas temperature ( 308@xmath2022 k ) , h@xmath2 density ( @xmath35 @xmath6 ) and smaller size ( @xmath240.04 pc ) indicate a _ hot core _ in this region .    following gibb et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we adopt @xmath36 @xmath32 as a typical h@xmath37 column density . using this value",
    ", we calculate a fractional abundance of ch@xmath28cn relative to h@xmath37 of @xmath38 .",
    "the derived abundance is close to that in the orion hot core ( blake et al .",
    "the derived rotation temperature agrees ( within 2@xmath12 of the least - square fit ) with the value of 280 k estimated by the nh@xmath0 lines ( soillns et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the similar gas temperatures derived from the ch@xmath0cn and nh@xmath0 lines suggest a close relationship between the two n - containing species .",
    "the gas - phase chemistry likely dominates the pathways to produce ch@xmath0cn ( rodgers & charnley 2001 ) , in which nh3 evaporates from grain surfaces and ch3cn is then formed via gas - phase reactions at high temperatures .",
    "based on the high temperature ( 300 k ) gas - phase chemical model ( rodgers & charnley 2001 ) , if nh@xmath0 is injected for the chemical reactions , the derived fractional abundance of the ch@xmath0cn of 5@xmath3010@xmath39 corresponds to a time - scale of 1.5@xmath40 yr which is in good agreement with those ( 1.9@xmath41 yr ) observed in other hot cores ( kurtz et al .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn , so@xmath2 , ocs and ch@xmath0oh spectra have similar radial velocities and line widths , suggesting that the n - bearing , o - bearing and s - bearing molecules probably originated from the hot core .      for the @xmath1co absorption component in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the derived optical depth of the line peak is 0.57 by use of the line to continuum ratio ( cf .",
    "equation ( 1 ) of qin et al .",
    "the intensity of 1 jy  beam@xmath9 in this observation corresponds to a brightness temperature of 26 k under the rayleigh - jeans approximation .",
    "given the beam filling factors of the line and continuum of 0.5 , the upper limit of the excitation temperature in the @xmath1co line is 35 k ( cf . equation ( 5 ) of qin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "assuming the gas is in lte and the emission component ( with integrated flux density of 9.1 jy  beam@xmath9 km  s@xmath9 ) is optically thin with abundances of [ co]/[@xmath1co]=89 and [ co]/[h@xmath2]=1@xmath43 , the h@xmath2 column densities of the absorption and emission components are @xmath44 4.6@xmath45 and 6.8@xmath45 @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the major axes of the absorption and emission components are approximately 0.025 and 0.04 pc .",
    "the estimated h@xmath37 densities and masses are 5.9@xmath46 @xmath6 , 1.5 m@xmath47 and 5.5@xmath46 @xmath6 , 1.9 m@xmath47 for the absorption and emission components , respectively . compared with the rotation temperature and h@xmath2 density traced by ch@xmath0cn lines , the lower excitation temperature and h@xmath2 densities suggest that the @xmath1co is located outside of the hot molecular core .",
    "the average @xmath27 from multiple lines is an approximation of the systemic velocity of the molecular cloud ( sutton et al .",
    "the average @xmath27 of the emission lines ( except for h30@xmath3 , co and @xmath1co ) is 95.4@xmath200.5 km  s@xmath9 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we adopt 95.4@xmath200.5 km  s@xmath9 as the systemic velocity of the cloud .",
    "the spectrum in the @xmath1co line ( see fig .",
    "2(j ) ) shows that the absorption is blue - shifted and the emission is red - shifted with respect to the systemic velocity , consisting of a p cygni - like profile . a ne - sw velocity gradient and broad line wings in nw - se direction",
    "have been observed in the radio recombination lines ( sewilo et al .",
    "the authors proposed a rotating motion responsible for the observed velocity gradient and an outflow along the rotational axis in the nw - se direction . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the peaks of the absorption and emission are aligned with the rotational axis . the spectral profile along with the @xmath1co distribution appear to indicate an outflow from the molecular core , where the blue - shifted absorption ( in front of the continuum ) is flowing toward us and the red - shifted emission ( behind the continuum ) is moving away in the opposite direction .",
    "the co spectrum shows a complex with red - shifted emission and both blue and red - shifted absorption with respect to the systemic velocity ( see fig .",
    "the infall component in this region were observed by red - shifted absorption in the nh@xmath0 line ( sollins et al . 2005 ) .",
    "likely the blue - shifted outflow traced by the co line in this observation is mixed with the infall .",
    "higher spatial and spectral resolution observations are needed to verify the kinematics traced by the co line .",
    "the position - velocity diagram across the peak of the continuum along the ne - sw direction is constructed from the ocs line ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . in fig .",
    "4 , the velocities of the two emission peaks are 95 and 97 km  s@xmath9 with 0.2@xmath8 separation , respectively , indicating a velocity gradient in ne - sw direction . assuming a rotating motion along ne - sw with a rotation axis in the nw - se direction ( sewilo et al .",
    "2008 ) and an equilibrium between rotational and gravitational forces , the dynamical mass responsible for the rotation can be estimated by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the velocity difference and spatial separation of the emission peaks , respectively ; @xmath51 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the derived dynamical mass is 25 m@xmath47 , which is consistent with the mass derived by sewilo et al .",
