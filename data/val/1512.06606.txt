    "observations as well as theoretical studies on coronal heating and solar wind acceleration had long since drawn attention to the dissipation of mhd waves through various processes .",
    "particularly , north polar coronal hole ( npch ) have been observed by various satellites , for instance , yohkoh , wind , soho , hinode , trace , etc .",
    "the effective temperature of npch has been found as high as @xmath3 k. since the surface temperature of the sun is much lower than the npch one , two questions are immediately required to be answered : 1 ) what is the continuous source of energy for npch , since the plasma with that much high temperature is bound to lose energy to the transition region below through heat conduction and optically thin emission ? and 2 ) what kind of force causes solar wind acceleration ?",
    "observations revealed that npch may be regarded as collisional up to the radial distance 1.7 - 2.1 r range , where @xmath4 . within this domain",
    ", mhd waves may donate their energies into random thermal motions of particles through microscopic mechanisms , i.e. , viscosity , thermal conductivity and resistivity .",
    "@xcite pointed out that dissipative processes , we listed above , cause damping of mhd waves and thus heat the plasma . in the extensive review articles by @xcite and",
    "@xcite it was shown that alfven waves , fast and slow magnetosonic waves are the most likely candidates to heat the coronal plasma and accelerate the solar wind .",
    "energy fluxes of acoustic waves are so low and the damping length scales are so short that they are excluded from the list of energy supplier candidates @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that acoustic waves with period @xmath5 and energy flux density @xmath6 may heat the plasma to the temperatures of @xmath7 k by dissipation of n - waves after the formation of the shocks .",
    "he also noted that other collective processes with larger length scales may heat the coronal plasma and accelerate the solar wind .",
    "presence of mhd waves in npch is revealed by euv observations carried out by soho , hinode and trace satellites .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite reported the presence of propagating and standing compressional waves in corona .",
    "alfven waves are also observed @xcite .    in the heliocentric distance range 1.4 - 2.6 @xmath8 the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration",
    "are shown by uvcs observations to be more effective @xcite . in earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite , the required energy flux density to heat the corona is evaluated as @xmath9 . when electron number density , magnetic field strength and the turbulent velocity amplitude are taking as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , it was shown that energy flux density of an mhd wave becomes @xmath13 at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out multichannel polarimetric observations and detected alfven waves with a phase speed @xmath15 .",
    "they concluded that the observed alfven waves were not energetic enough to heat the corona .",
    "however , @xcite managed to observe the alfven waves and measured their amplitudes , phase speeds , the periods ( of order of @xmath16 ) and then calculated the energy flux densities of these waves which were found to be high enough to heat the npch and accelerate the solar wind .",
    "@xcite reviewed the observational evidences of propagating mhd waves in coronal holes .",
    "periods of the mhd waves observed in coronal hole via remote sensing are listed in table 1 of this paper .",
    "periods of waves detected in plumes and interplume lanes vary between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "waves observed other regions of coronal holes ( on - disk and off - limb ) have a period range of @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite developed a model which is specifically applicable to the coronal hole . in this model ,",
    "the authors considered the alfven wave phase mixing in a magnetic field which consists of open field lines and has two dimensions wherein the vertical scale height is greater than that of the horizontal . in their model",
    "they considered viscosity as a free parameter since the kinematic viscosity coefficient in the solar corona has no certain value .",
    "their model predicts that alfven waves with a period falling in a @xmath21 range are not damped near the plume boundary if the vertical height @xmath22 and @xmath23 . on the other hand , when the viscosity coefficient is raised to the value @xmath24 and",
    "the other parameters are kept unchanged , alfven waves are damped and transferred their energy to the magnetised plasma .",
    "surface wave heating is also one of the possibilities for heating coronal hole @xcite .",
    "the authors evaluated that in a radial magnetic field configuration with a strength @xmath25 , waves go through a strong dissipation within a radial distance range @xmath26 ( in a nonlinear regime ) and @xmath27 ( in a linear regime ) .",
    "their model predicts that in a magnetic field showing distortion in radial direction ( `` strong spreading '' in their jargon ) surface waves are strongly dissipated by the coronal hole plasma .",
    "the presence of linearly polarized spherical alfven waves in coronal hole is also considered as a possible agent to heat the plasma and accelerate the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the authors investigated the weakly non - linear dynamics of the waves in a medium wherein only the shear viscosity plays an important role in dissipation .",
    "they remind the reader that there is no reliable information about the radial dependence of the viscosity coefficient in a coronal hole and assume constant viscosity .",
    "their conclusion is that in a plasma with normalized viscosity @xmath28 , linearly polarized alfven waves with periods @xmath29 are damped within a radial distance less than @xmath30 .",
    "the upper parts of the chromosphere and the corona are believed to be characterized by strong resistivity , anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "the authors considered slow surface waves propagating in the above - defined plasma threaded by equilibrium magnetic field . in the fluid description",
    ", they assumed that away from the dissipative region only the parallel ( to the magnetic field ) thermal conductivity and viscosity are important .",
    "however , at the layer where waves are dissipated they adopted the full braginskii expressions for viscosity , electrical resistivity and the heat flux . in their conclusion , it is the resonant absorption that causes the surface wave damping .",
    "ultraviolet coronograph spectrometer white - light channel ( uvcs / wlc ) and extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) observations revealed the presence of slow magnetoacoustic waves in polar plumes . using these data @xcite investigated the damping of waves propagating in a gravitationally stratified medium threaded by radially divergent magnetic field .",
    "two - dimensional mhd model of the authors contains the non - linear effects of the solar wind and viscosity .",
    "dissipation length scale of the waves with amplitude @xmath31 turns out to be @xmath32 .",
    "if the viscosity is taken into account for the waves with amplitude @xmath33 and with a period @xmath34 , damping length scale becomes @xmath35 .",
    "close to the sun , dissipated waves may contribute to the acceleration of the solar wind either by increasing the thermal pressure of the coronal plasma or by undergoing landau damping and thus transferring momentum at the collisionless part of the hole which is further away from the sun .",
    "@xcite , in an mhd approximation , considered the wave propagation in npch wherein temperature and number density of ions show gradients both in the parallel and the perpendicular directions to the magnetic field .",
    "they also took into account the heat conduction in both directions to the magnetic field , but neglected viscosity .",
    "even the fluid description of npch revealed the resonance absorption of the waves .    in this paper , we assume that the parallel and the perpendicular ( to the magnetic field ) heat conduction and viscosity affect the propagation characteristics of mhd waves in npch and these waves , in turn , interact with ions and preferentially heat them .",
    "soho / uvcs data on and ions showed that npch plasma becomes collisionless beyond the radial distance @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we considered npch plasma collisional up to radial distance @xmath37 and used mhd approximation .",
    "this study investigates the effects of the isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation characteristics of the mhd waves in npch .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give details of our model of npch .",
    "in section 3 we give basic mhd equations and linearized mhd equations .",
    "we obtain the dispersion relations of the driven waves in the case of absence and presence of parallel heat conduction , separately .",
    "we estimate the damping length scales and energy flux densities of these waves .",
    "finally section 4 concludes this paper with a brief summary and discussion of our major results .",
    "soho / uvcs data revealed that npch was structured with so - called plumes and interplume lanes @xcite . in their figure 1 , @xcite drew attention to the fact that plumes are brighter , higher in density but cooler than interplume lanes .",
    "temperature anisotropy for ions in npch were revealed by soho / uvcs data , i.e. , @xmath38 , where subscripts refer to the perpendicular and the parallel directions to the magnetic field , respectively @xcite .",
    "spectral line widths of ions taken from interplume lanes turned out to be wider than the ones taken from plumes .",
    "this , of course , indicates that perpendicular ( to the magnetic field lines ) heating in interplume lanes is more effective than that of plumes @xcite . besides , minor ion species he@xmath39 , , , etc . also confirmed the temperature anisotropy in npch .",
    "many authors considered npch as electrically quasi - neutral , i.e. , @xmath40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in figure 2 of @xcite electron number densities in plumes and interplume lanes",
    "are plotted .",
    "this figure reveals that @xmath41 in plumes is about 10% higher than that of interplume lanes .",
    "one can find electron number density plots with respect to heliocentric distance in @xcite s study .",
    "the empirical fit by @xcite seems to be the most consistent one with data points ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the heliocentric distance .",
    "following the authors who consider npch as quasi - neutral , we assume that @xmath44 and try to model npch in two dimensions : one is the heliocentric distance , i.e. , @xmath4 and the other , @xmath45 , is the direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the line of sight ( @xmath46 ) ; @xmath45 is measured in arc seconds .",

    "because of the absence of data as to how the magnetic filed varies in plumes and interplume lanes , and besides in @xmath45 direction , we assume that the equation ( 3 ) above is applied to both pl and ipl .",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52 line width is shown to vary both in the @xmath53 and the @xmath45 direction @xcite .",
    "@xcite formulated the total effective temperatures of minor ion species as the sum of ion temperature and the contribution from non - thermal processes ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the most probable speed of ion along the @xmath46 and @xmath56 is the most probable speed of an isotropic , gaussian distributed , turbulent velocity field .",
    "@xcite argued that the origin of non - thermal part of the line width is either alfven wave dissipation or ion cyclotron resonance ( icr ) after a turbulent cascade .",
    "it is almost impossible to separate these contributions to line widths .",

    "taking this fact into account and by using data for @xmath56 , @xcite derived a polynomial for the non - thermal part of the effective temperature of ions .",
    "@xmath58    @xcite report that ion effective temperature in the interplume lanes is about 30% higher than that of plumes ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . with this observational fact we may express the effective temperature in two dimensions as below :    @xmath59    the thermal conductivity and viscosity have anisotropic character due to the presence of magnetic field in npch .",
    "the parallel ( to the magnetic field ) thermal diffusivity for ions is given by @xcite    @xmath60    for the plumes and interplume lanes under the typical coronal conditions @xmath61 .",
    "in npch the ratio @xmath62 is unknown , therefore we take it as a free parameter . for solar corona ,",

    "it may be argued that for solar coronal conditions @xmath64 .",
    "but it is not negligible when @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite argued that even the ratio @xmath62 assumes the value @xmath66 it should be taken into consideration because it removes unphysical singularity in the case of @xmath67 for thermal instability .    the coefficient of kinematic viscosity in the isotropic case is given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the coulomb logarithm @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the viscosity coefficient for solar corona is quite uncertain .",
    "there is a same uncertainty on the coefficient of the conduction .",
    "bearing this fact in mind , in this study we use both coefficients as free parameters remaining around theirs estimated values from equation ( 8) and ( 9 ) for the model of npch .",

    "<S> this paper presents a new model of north polar coronal hole ( npch ) to study dissipation / propagation of mhd waves . we investigate the effects of the isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation characteristics of the mhd waves in npch . </S>",
    "<S> we first model npch by considering the differences in radial as well as in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight ( _ los _ ) in temperature , particle number density and non - thermal velocities between plumes and interplume lanes for the specific case of ions . </S>",
    "<S> this model includes parallel and perpendicular ( to the magnetic field ) heat conduction and viscous dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> next , we derive the dispersion relations for the mhd waves in the case of absence and presence of parallel heat conduction . in the case of absence of parallel heat conduction </S>",
    "<S> , we find that mhd wave dissipation strongly depends on the viscosity for modified acoustic and alfven waves . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flux density of acoustic waves varies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 while the energy flux density of alfven waves turned out to be between @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> but , solutions of the magnetoacustic waves show that the parallel heat conduction introduce anomalous dispersion to the npch plasma wherein the group velocity of waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggests all these waves may provide significant source for the observed preferential accelerating and heating of ions , in turn coronal plasma heating and an extra accelerating agent for fast solar wind in npch .    </S>",
