    "we present a new monte carlo generator of events for neutrino interactions . the original motivation for our work was to improve nux+fluka scheme where no separate resonance contribution is present @xcite .",
    "the aim of nux+fluka was to describe interactions of neutrinos of higher energies and from that point of view the resonance part was of minor importance .",
    "usually mc generators contain a resonance contribution described by means of rein - sehgal model covering the kinematical region of hadronic invariant mass @xmath1 . if for neutrino reactions the quark - hadron duality holds true one can assume that contributions from higher resonances are averaged by deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions and that only the dominant @xmath0 resonance has to be treated separately .",
    "the current version of the generator includes various dynamical models : quasi - elastic @xcite , @xmath0 excitation @xcite , and dis for which we use grv94 parton distribution functions ( pdf ) @xcite with modifications proposed by bodek and yang @xcite .",
    "the total cross section for the neutrino scattering is assumed to be the incoherent sum : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the sum of cross sections for single pion production ( spp ) and cc and nc denote charge and neutral current reactions respectively .    the mc generator is organized around the event structure which contains three vectors of particles : incoming , temporary and outgoing .",
    "it also contains a structure with all the parameters used and a set of boolean flags tagging the event as qel , dis , cc , nc etc .",
    "the input parameters are read at startup from a text file and the events are stored in the root tree file to simplify further analysis .",
    "different interactions are implemented as functions acting on the event structure reading the incoming particles and producing the temporary ones .",
    "the type of the interaction is chosen according to the ratio of the total cross sections .    in our presentation",
    "we focus on single pion channels .",
    "we present many comparisons with the existing experimental data . in the near future",
