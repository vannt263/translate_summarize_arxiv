    "cosmic rays ( crs ) and magnetic fields are essential components for many astrophysical ecosystems , including galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( see schlickeiser 2002 ) . in many instances ,",
    "e.g. milky way , the pressure of crs and magnetic fields is larger than the gas pressure . as a rule ,",
    "astrophysical magnetic fields are frozen in turbulent plasma and move together with it . as a result ,",
    "crs interacting with turbulent magnetic fields get scattered and accelerated ( see melrose 1968 , schlickeiser 2002 ) .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation is widely used to describe the actual magnetized plasma turbulence over scales that are much larger than both the mean free path of the particles and their larmor radius ( see kulsrud 2004 ) .",
    "the theory of mhd turbulence has become testable recently due to numerical simulations ( see biskamp 2003 ) and this provided reliable foundations for describing turbulence - crs interactions .",
    "the simulations ( see cho & lazarian 2005 and ref . therein ) confirmed the prediction of magnetized alfvnic eddies being elongated along magnetic field ( see shebalin , matthaeus & montgomery 1983 , higdon 1984 ) and provided results consistent with the quantitative relations for the degree of eddy elongation obtained in goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 , henceforth gs95 ) .",
    "scattering of crs is an essential part of both cr propagation modes and models of cr acceleration .",
    "efficient scattering is usually postulated ( see schlickeiser 2002 ) , which ensures high degrees of coupling of crs and magnetized plasma .",
    "in addition , efficient scattering provides appreciable second order fermi acceleration and enables the return of crs into the shock to ensure the first order fermi acceleration .",
    "this corner stone of cr physics has been challenged recently when it became clear that alfvnic eddies are stretched along magnetic field direction . as the interaction between crs and such elongated eddies is weak ( see discussion in lerche & schlickeiser 2001 ) ,",
    "this resulted in the prediction of long mean free paths for milky way crs ( chandran 2000 , yan & lazarian 2002 , henceforth yl02 ) .",
    "yl02 and yan & lazarian ( 2004 ) attempted to remedy the situation by appealing to cr scattering by isotropic sound - like fast modes .",
    "however , plasma - dependent damping of fast modes made the scattering very different in different parts of the interstellar medium .",
    "is such a radical change of the cr scattering picture absolutely necessary ?",
    "we note , that the problem of cr scattering goes well beyond the milky way physics .",
    "brunetti ( 2006 ) discussed the implications of suppressed cr scattering on the acceleration of crs in the clusters of galaxies .",
    "is there any process through which scattering by fast modes can provide high efficiency of cr scattering ?",
    "below we consider such a process that is related to cr feedback on mhd turbulence .",
    "we show that compression of crs induces instability that results in the generation of modes that are parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "such modes that are also frequently referred to as slab modes have been long employed in the models of cr propagation ( see , e.g. , jokipii 1966 ) , their origin , however , was somewhat mysterious .",
    "this paper provides a physically motivated mechanism for the generation of slab modes and quantify the efficiency of their generation .    in what follows",
    "we discuss the properties of compressible mhd turbulence in   2 .",
    "we describe the kinetic instability that develops in crs when the magnetic field is compressed on scales less than the cr mean free path in   3 .",
    "we consider the non - linear saturation of the instability in   4 and its large - scale cut - off that follows from the interaction of the instability waves with the ambient turbulence in   5 .",
    "the feedback of crs to compressible turbulence is considered in ",
    "6 . the implications of our work for various ism phases and intra - cluster medium ( icm ) are considered in   7 .",
    "the short summary of this work is presented in   8 .",
    "in this section we provide a summary of the current knowledge of compressible mhd turbulence that we appeal to in our work .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , we describe an alternative mechanism for the scattering of low - energy crs that provides rather small mean free paths for crs . at scales larger than the mean free path crs",
    "are well coupled to the flow of the thermal plasma . therefore to identify new effects we concentrate on the mhd fluctuations on scales equal or smaller than the mean free path .",
    "the gs95 model quantifies turbulence anisotropy , introducing the so - called _ critical balance _",
    "relation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to , respectively , the parallel and perpendicular wavenumber of eddies measured in respect to the _ local _ magnetic field .",
    "this scaling is true for both alfvnic and pseudo - alfvnic motions , which are the incompressible limit of the slow modes .",
    "gs95 and later lithwick & goldreich ( 2001 ) argued that the slow modes are passively advected by the alfvn modes , while the energy exchange between the modes is small .",
    "numerical studies ( cho & vishniac 2000 , maron & goldreich 2001 , cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002 , mller , biskamp & grappin 2003 ) provided reasonable support for the critical balance condition spectral index stayed more controversial , as maron & goldreich ( 2001 ) reported the spectrum closer to @xmath3 . while the ongoing work ( see muller & grappin 2005 , boldyrev 2005 , 2006 , beresnyak & lazarian 2006 ) attempts to improve our understanding of alfvnic turbulence , we shall use the original gs95 scalings for the sake of simplicity of our presentation . ] .",
    "we introduce the outer scale @xmath4 and use gs95 scaling in the form @xmath5    we feel that gs95 provides a good starting point for studies of mildly compressible , and even supersonic mhd turbulence .",
    "indeed , numerical calculations in cho & lazarian ( 2002 , 2003 , henceforth cl02 , cl03 ) showed that scalings of the slow and alfvn modes in compressible mhd are similar to their scalings in the incompressible case .",
    "the fast mode perturbations , on the other hand , are found to be mostly isotropic with a power - law index of about @xmath3 ( see cl02 ) , which is the index of so - called acoustic wave turbulence .",
    "the coupling of the fast and alfvn modes was shown to be weak , which allows separate studies of the corresponding cascades provided that the alfvnic turbulence is strong , i.e. it evolved to develop the critical balance .    in the following treatment",
    "we will be primarily interested in two manifestations of compressible mhd turbulence , one of which is perturbations of the _ magnitude _ of the magnetic field and the other is wave damping through cascading by the ambient alfvnic turbulence .",
    "let us briefly discuss how much of our results depend on the adopted model of mhd turbulence .",
    "as we are dealing with very small perturbations down in the inertial range , alfvnic mode , having magnetic field perturbations perpendicular to the local magnetic field , has very little effect on the magnetic field magnitude , therefore , as far as the magnetic field compression is concerned , we are dealing with compressible modes .",
    "we introduce the power - law energy spectrum for the velocity perturbations of the compressible modes , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 for the kolmogorov - type , and @xmath8 for the acoustic type spectrum .",
    "such a spectrum translates into velocities at the scale of @xmath9 , which is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is not necessarily the injection scale for mhd turbulence , but a quantity which contains information on both the injection scale and the efficacy of driving .",
    "this scaling might not be valid up to scales as large as @xmath12 .",
    "if both sonic and alfvnic mach numbers are around unity at the injection , we expect @xmath12 to be of the order of the actual injection scale .",
    "efficacy of driving depend on its type , such as mostly solenoidal , or mostly compressive ( supernova shocks , etc . ) .",
    "a precise estimate of the parameter @xmath12 requires either detailed knowledge of the physics of driving , or direct measurement of the compressive fluctuation intensity somewhere in the inertial range .    the alfvn wave damping by alfvnic turbulence we use in   4 assumes gs95 scaling and anisotropy with some outer scale @xmath4 .",
    "this scale might correspond to the isotropic injection of energy at scale @xmath12 and the injection velocity of @xmath13 , i.e. the alfvn mach number @xmath14 .",
    "this model can be easily generalized for both @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the injection . indeed , if @xmath15 , instead of the driving scale @xmath17 for @xmath4 one can use the scale at which the turbulent velocity gets equal to @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath18 magnetic fields are not dynamically important at large scales and the turbulence follows the kolmogorov cascade @xmath19 over the range of scales @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "this provides @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath16 , the turbulence obeys gs95 scaling ( also called `` strong '' mhd turbulence ) not from the scale @xmath17 , but from a smaller scale @xmath22 ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) , while in the range @xmath23 $ ] the turbulence is `` weak '' .",
    "the velocity at scale @xmath24 is expressed as @xmath25 , so that the `` effective '' value of @xmath4 will be @xmath26 .",
    "all in all , given the strength and the nature of driving in a particular astrophysical environment one may estimate the two parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath4 that determine the velocity perturbations of the compressible and alfvnic mode at small scales .    in   3 we deal with the fluctuations of the magnetic field magnitude squared .",
    "the normalized amplitude of these fluctuations denoted as @xmath27 will depend on the plasma @xmath28 which is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic field pressure . in high-@xmath28 plasmas @xmath29",
    "will be perturbed mostly by slow waves ( cl03 ) and the value of @xmath27 will be equal to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field . in the inertial range of strong turbulence",
    "the slow mode exhibits the same anisotropy as the alfvnic mode .",
    "therefore @xmath31 is close to @xmath32 , so we can disregard the angular factor , i.e. @xmath33 . the perturbation made by the fast mode in high beta plasmas is smaller by a factor of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is sound velocity . in low-@xmath28 plasmas this situation is reversed , with the slow mode only marginally perturbing @xmath36 , but we may use the same expression @xmath37 for the fast mode .",
    "we estimate the angular factor as of the order of unity , since fast modes are almost isotropic ( cl02 ) . in other words , the expression @xmath33 is interpreted as the compression factor for the _ most compressive mode _ which is the slow wave in high-@xmath28 plasmas and the fast wave in low-@xmath28 plasmas",
    ".    the lower limits to the scales we described are determined by the damping of mhd modes .",
    "while the alfvnic mode in fully ionized media is supposed to be damped at the thermal larmor radius , the compressive modes are damped by more efficient collisional and collisionless damping ( ginzburg 1961 , barnes & scargle 1973 , yl04 ) .",
    "in this paper we introduce the value of the most compressive mode cut - off scale as @xmath38 .",
    "it is obvious that at scales less than their mean free path crs can be treated as a collisionless fluid .",
    "particles in the collisionless fluid preserve the adiabatic invariant @xmath39 , where @xmath36 is the the magnetic field strength and @xmath40 is the momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "mhd compressive modes change the magnitude of @xmath36 so that the distribution in momentum space becomes anisotropic ( see chew , goldberger & low , 1956 ) .",
    "such a distribution is subject to a number of instabilities , some of which are hydrodynamic , i.e. involve the change of the entire distribution function , while others are kinetic , i.e. involve a chance in a fraction of particles , that is resonant with a particular wave - mode .",
    "well - known examples of hydrodynamic instabilities are firehose and mirror instabilities ( see e.g. mikhailovskii , 1975 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities are typically fast with the largest wavenumber growing almost as fast as the gyrofrequency , but have a threshold , i.e. small deviations from isotropy do not induce instability .",
    "while compressive motions can generally induce rather large changes in the magnitude of @xmath36 on scales at the injection scale of turbulence @xmath12 , in  3 we estimate mean free path and show that it is much smaller than @xmath12",
    ". therefore the compressions of the magnetic field we deal with are too small to induce hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "it has been well known that the momentum distribution functions with @xmath41 , are subject to kinetic instability called gyroresonance instability ( sagdeev & shafranov , 1961 , mikhailovskii , 1975 , gary , 1993 ) .",
    "this instability received less attention than its hydrodynamic counterparts .",
    "however , it is pretty fast for a power - law distribution of crs , as we demonstrate below .    for a power - law distribution of crs",
    "the growth rate of the cosmic - ray - alfvn gyroresonance instability ( henceforth gi ) can be estimated as ( see appendix ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number density of crs with momentum larger than the minimal resonant momentum for a wave vector value of @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the proton mass , @xmath46 is the density of the thermal plasma , @xmath47 is the ion plasma frequency .",
    "@xmath48 is a numerical factor , defined in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath49 sign corresponds to the two mhd modes .",
    "we shall concentrate on the alfvn mode , corresponding to the plus sign , as those are less subjected to linear damping ( see   2 , ",
    "6 ) . as we will demonstrate in the next chapter , when anisotropy is created by compressive turbulence , the anisotropy factor",
    "@xmath50 will be small and will change its sign on the scale of the mean free path , depending on two competitive mechanisms  scattering which tends to isotropize momentum distribution , and magnetic field compression which tends to make it oblate or prolate .",
    "we assumed that the unperturbed distribution of crs is isotropic and follows a power law i.e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 is conveniently defined as the power - law index for a one - dimensional distribution ( or particle density ) .",
    "for example , around the earth @xmath53 up to the energies of @xmath54  ev . note , that in order for the total energy to converge at high energies , @xmath52 should be larger than @xmath55 .    the expression for the instability rate , assuming @xmath33 ( see   2 )",
    ", could be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a larmor radius of a cr resonant with a particular wave vector @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the 1  gev proton larmor radius and @xmath60",
    "we introduce the cr mean free path @xmath61 below which crs could be treated as collisionless and the instability described in   3 is active . in the absence of other scattering processes the crs",
    "are scattered by the slab - type motions generated by the instability above .",
    "let us estimate @xmath61 following longair ( 1994 ) . if the change of magnetic field direction is @xmath62 the scattering that is a random walk requires @xmath63 interaction and @xmath64 where we designated @xmath65 as the magnetic field perturbation pertaining to a particular wavenumber , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "we can consider @xmath65 as a function of either @xmath67 or the resonant larmor radius @xmath57 ( see longair 1994 ) .",
    "as the instability grows , @xmath65 will grow , which reduces @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is the mean free path @xmath61 which determines the scale at which compressions of the magnetic field are important .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the cr distribution `` remembers '' the perturbed value of the magnetic field and its anisotropy only during the time the typical particle travels its mean free path .",
    "once particles scatter significantly , the anisotropy of the distribution is effectively `` reset '' . as a result only low amplitude motions on scales less than @xmath61 excite the instability , or in other words , the degree of anisotropy @xmath27 is determined by the _ local _ perturbation of the magnetic field on the the scale @xmath61 .",
    "we call this process _ non - linear suppression_.    the instability grows as @xmath68 where the injection of energy is happening at the scale of the mean free path , i.e. @xmath69 where eqs .",
    "( [ instab_main ] ) and ( [ mean_path ] ) were used .",
    "we see that according to the above equations @xmath65 perturbations will grow as @xmath70 thus reducing @xmath61 virtually to @xmath57 . in other words , the non - linear suppression is not able to constrain the development of instability and we have to consider other non - linear processes , such as wave steepening .",
    "steepening does not occur for a monochromatic circularly polarized alfvn wave as the amplitude of the magnetic field stays the same .",
    "however , for a collection of waves with different wavelengths the amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuates in space and time and therefore the steepening effect is present .",
    "the steepening rate can be estimated as @xmath71 where the `` - '' sign reflects the fact , that steepening damps the instability .    by comparing ( [ instab_limit ] ) and ( [ steep ] )",
    "we get the equilibrium or saturated amplitude of the instability - induced perturbations @xmath72 which for @xmath73 and @xmath74 produces a rather shallow spectrum of perturbations , @xmath75 .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ mean_path ] ) and ( [ amplitude ] ) one gets that the energy of the slab modes at @xmath76 is supplied from the compressions at scale @xmath77    so far we assumed that the turbulent compressible motions are not damped .",
    "this is a good approximation until @xmath61 is larger than the compressive mode cutoff scale @xmath38 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath78 the compression for the instability is supplied from the eddies at the damping scale , namely , @xmath79 .",
    "the modification of our formulae is self - evident . instead of eq .",

    "were injected at @xmath82 .",

    "wave decay was exponential after driving was switched off .",

    ", height=377 ]",
    "the instability we considered in   3 has the largest growth rates for the wave vector parallel to the field .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the phase of a resonance can be kept constant for a long time only if @xmath2 is small .",
    "the ambient turbulence non - linearly damps the instability through a process that is analogous to the suppression of the streaming instability ( yl02 , farmer & goldreich 2004 ) . in what follows",
    "we find the lower limit on @xmath2 using the approach similar to that in farmer & goldreich ( 2004 ) .",
    "we also provide the results of numerical calculations that validate this approach .    for alfvnic turbulence",
    "we adopt the gs95 scaling , ( [ gs95 ] ) , which reflects the tendency of eddies to get elongated along the magnetic field . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we take the scale @xmath4 , introduced in  2 , equal to the scale @xmath12 .",
    "this is not necessarily true for any astrophysical environment , however our formulae are trivially generalized for the case of @xmath84 .",
    "consider a wavepacket of alfvn waves that moves nearly parallel to the magnetic field with the dispersion of angles @xmath85 .",
    "the individual waves follow the local direction of the magnetic field lines . as a result",
    ", the dispersion in angles of the wave packet can not be less than the dispersion of angles due to the ambient alfvnic turbulence , @xmath86 .",
    "the latter for the gs95 model ( see eq .",
    "( [ gs95 ] ) ) is @xmath87 .",
    "the modes with minimal @xmath88 are the fastest growing ones .",
    "as we establish below ( see eq .",
    "( [ turb ] ) ) , they are the least damped .",
    "therefore for our simplified treatment we shall limit our attention to the wavepackets with resonant @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "one can determine the characteristic perpendicular wavenumber @xmath91 of the `` most parallel modes '' that are created by streaming crs .",
    "the strong alfvnic turbulence decorrelates the wavepacket with @xmath2 on the time scale of @xmath92 . thus using the above expression for @xmath2 and eq .",
    "( [ gs95 ] ) we get @xmath93 which , up to the `` - '' that we used to denote the damping nature of the process , coincides with the damping rate obtained in farmer & goldreich ( 2004 ) and with the results of our numerical simulations shown in fig . 1 .    a comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ instab_main ] ) and ( [ turb ] ) indicates that for the spectral index of crs @xmath94 the ambient alfvnic turbulence provides an upper limit on the scale of perturbations that arise from compressible - induced instabilities even without accounting for nonlinear suppression .",
    "if we use nonlinear suppression , the critical scale can be obtained by using eqs .",
    "( [ instab_limit ] ) , ( [ amplitude ] ) and ( [ turb ] ) . for @xmath95",
    "our instability is damped for all scales , larger than @xmath96 therefore the spectrum of plane alfvn waves given by eq .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) will protrude from @xmath97 down to @xmath98 which corresponds to minimum energies of crs .",
    "linear instability theory does not describe the energy transfer between particles and crs .",
    "moreover , in calculating linear response we have not included the cr input into the real part of the dielectric tensor .",
    "speaking of our description of cr scattering by waves , we can consider each resonant scattering event in the rest frame of the wave where it is a pure pitch - angle scattering , i.e. there is no energy transferred between the particle and the wave .",
    "basically , the model of linear instability and its nonlinear suppression and saturation developed in  4 is unable to fully describe the transfer of energy from compressible modes to crs and from crs to high - frequency waves which are finally dissipated by steepening .",
    "we would like to note that the transfer of energy is , in principle , might be very important for the particular models of turbulence we are using in  2 .",
    "they are so - called _ kolmogorov - type _ models in which the turbulence is initiated at large scales , is being local in k - space and is characterized by the flow of energy from large to small scales .",
    "both slow wave passive transfer by strong alfvnic turbulence and weak fast wave turbulence models we use in   2 are of this type .",
    "when energy is being drained out of such turbulence it does not any longer follow universal power - law scalings we described in  2 . in this section",
    "we will estimate the transfer of energy from compressible motions and how it modifies the spectra of turbulence and processes described in  4 .",
    "let us first figure out the processes of transfer of energy from crs to waves . as we noted before",
    ", there is no transfer of energy in the frame moving with the wave .",
    "therefore , if we have waves moving in only one direction , particles will pitch - scatter and establish the drift equilibrium with such waves",
    ". the drift velocity will be equal to the alfvn velocity .",
    "this is the case of the well - known streaming instability if we can neglect the wave damping . in our case , however , we have waves moving in both directions , so the particle can lose or gain energy in the lab frame by multiple scattering .",
    "if each scattering event changes pitch angle by @xmath62 ( c.f . eq ( 5 ) ) the energy is changed by @xmath99 .",
    "this occurs at a larmor frequency , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "now , starting with two above equations we can talk about two processes , one of which is the well - known diffusion in energy space , described by the diffusion coefficient @xmath101 estimated as    @xmath102    this process is mostly describe the particle - wave equilibrium state where energy is slowly redistributed between particles .",
    "suppose , however , that we efficiently drain energy from the waves so that the situation become non - equilibrium .",
    "in this case we talk about the second process which is a directed transfer of energy from particles to waves .",
    "the rate of this process depends on the degree of non - equilibrium , but generally can not exceed the inverse of the minimum time at which particles can lose the energy available from anisotropy , i.e.    @xmath103    this rate is actually @xmath104 times higher than a steepening rate .",
    "more careful estimate show that the volumetric rate of the energy exchange between particles and waves divided by the volumetric steepening energy rate is equal to @xmath105 which is much larger then unity .",
    "therefore we can conclude that if the energy is drained from waves at a steepening rate , it will be efficiently resupplied by crs .",
    "the anisotropy of cr distribution is , in turn , supplied by the compressive perturbations .",
    "cr pressure is usually neglected in the dispersion relation for the compressive perturbations .",
    "however we know that it is there as crs and the perturbation are connected by the magnetic field .",
    "when a fraction of the cr pressure is lost due to the process described above , some of the perturbation energy is lost too .",
    "this provides a new mechanism for the damping of compressive perturbations in a medium with crs .    as we noted previously , each particular scale of compressive motions @xmath61 transfers energy to a smaller scale of motions at @xmath57 . also , we know that the flow of energy in kolmogorov - type turbulence is a constant .",
    "the steepening rate for the reasonable range of parameters is , however , growing rather fast , as we show in the next section .",
    "this could lead to a model where compressive motions are fully damped at a particular scale @xmath106 where kolmogorov energy transfer rate is equal to the steepening rate at the scale @xmath107 .",
    "more careful consideration , however , shows a different picture . at the end of  4 we showed that scales larger than @xmath61",
    "could also provide some compression for the crs .",
    "if this compression is higher than the one produced at @xmath61 , it will also provide higher energy rate .",
    "therefore , the compressive motions at scales , smaller than our `` feedback damping '' scale are not damped fully , but rather to the state where they provide marginal compression .",
    "it is easy to see , that this correspond to the @xmath108 law , or spectrum of turbulence @xmath109 .",
    "this spectrum of compressive motions will protrude from the scale @xmath106 down to scale @xmath38 .",
    "the amplitudes of the high - frequency slab alfvnic motions , corresponding to these and lower scales will be determined by formula ( 10 ) . the following handy expression and equations from  4",
    "could be used to derive @xmath106 :    @xmath110    fig .",
    "2 shows energy densities of the compressive motions and alfvn slab - type waves in two cases : first , when the cr feedback is unimportant , but compressive motions are damped at @xmath38 ; second , when the cr feedback become important at some scale @xmath106 .",
    "spectral slopes correspond to the case with @xmath74 .",
    "lets consider crs in galaxy clusters . the magnetic field magnitude and the density of crs are somewhat uncertain there ( see esslin et al .",
    "2005 ) , so we adopt values similar to our galaxy , namely @xmath111 g , @xmath112 and @xmath73 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to equipartition between cr and magnetic field energies . in clusters",
    "these energy densities are around 5 per cent of the thermal energy density .",
    "we will have then @xmath113  pc . the reference larmor radius of 1  gev proton is @xmath114  pc .",
    "we take the scale @xmath115  kpc , which , being alfvnic at this scale , corresponds roughly to driving with the virial velocity at the scale of 30 kpc . for these numerical values and @xmath74",
    "we will have , from eq .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) , @xmath116 , almost independent on scale , @xmath117  pc , @xmath118  pc , and the mean free path corresponding to the turbulent damping ( @xmath119 ) is 0.4  pc which is much smaller than the outer scale .",
    "we estimate collisionless cutoff as @xmath120  pc .",
    "the feedback mean free path will be around 0.3 pc , so the spectrum of alfvnic slab motions will be mostly steeper , @xmath121 and the mean free paths will be modified according to ( 10 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the efficient cr scattering entails efficient second - order fermi acceleration , see eq .",

    "one can assume same values for @xmath36 , @xmath52 and @xmath46 and value of @xmath12 around 50  pc .",
    "we assume an acoustic turbulence spectrum for fast waves , taking @xmath122 . we generally get a smaller range of alfvnic slab motions , from scales of @xmath59 to about @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "the resulting mean free paths @xmath61 vary from @xmath125  pc to @xmath126  pc .",
    "in the galactic corona , fast waves will be damped by collisionless damping ( see , e.g. , ginzburg 1961 ) with a cutoff of around @xmath127  pc , which is within the range of @xmath61 that we deal with . in the warm ionized medium",
    "( wim ) the collisional damping cutoff will be around @xmath128  pc .",
    "the feedback mean free path will be around @xmath129 . again",
    "the spectrum of slab motions becomes steeper and the mean free paths of crs are modified accordingly .    in ",
    "2 we assumed that the compression factor @xmath27 is larger than @xmath130 . this assumption is satisfied in galaxy clusters , as , from the previously adopted values and @xmath131  @xmath132 , @xmath133 , while compression factors for scales between 2  pc and @xmath134  pc are between @xmath135 and @xmath136 . for the milky way ism",
    "this condition is satisfied much better , as for @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and compression factors are generally larger , due to the fact that the minimum @xmath139 is smaller .",
    "the slab alfvn modes had been a part of the cr paradigm from the very start of the research in the field ( see jokipii 1966 ) .",
    "together with anisotropic components they are part of some of the modern models of cr propagation ( see zank & matthaeus 1992 , bieber et al . 1994 , shalchi et al .",
    "2006 ) . in our model the slab plane - parallel modes emerge naturally as the result of the interaction of compressible turbulence with cr .",
    "although this mechanism is different from the earlier considered processes , it may justify some of the earlier calculations invoking slab modes . unlike earlier theories we predict the dependence on the amount of the slab mode energy on the relative pressure of the crs .",
    "as we see , in both clusters of galaxies and ionized gas in milky way the instability within cr fluid limits the crs mean free path .",
    "like in scenario discussed in yl04 , where the compressible fast modes were identified as the major crs scattering agent , compressive modes are essential for scattering .",
    "however in this treatment , unlike yl04 , we show that compressions at scales much larger than the resonance scale are important .",
    "this difference is crucial for scattering of low - energy crs , as the fast mode have collisional or collisionless cut - offs which , depending on the media , may be larger than the low - energy cr gyroradius . in this case",
    "yl04 appealed to transient time damping ( ttd ) processes , which are less efficient for scattering than gyroresonance .",
    "our present work shows that the slab alfvn mode discussed in the present paper can be responsible for efficient scattering .",
    "another important difference from yl04 is that our new mechanism require relatively large total pressure of crs ( see ( [ lili ] ) ) . in the case",
    "when the pressure of crs is negligible the fast modes could stay the major scattering agent ( see petrosian et al , 2006 ) .",
    "our model predicts rather small mean free paths , but this does not contradict the estimates on the average lifetime of the cr in the galaxy .",
    "these lifetimes are estimated to be around galaxy thickness divided by the alfvn velocity , which is a powerful support for the models with streaming instability .",
    "our model will predict similar lifetimes , because it includes turbulence which advects crs on outer scale comparable with galaxy thickness with velocity of around alfvn velocity . in fact , the turbulence itself could be generated on these scales by parker instability .",
    "previous discussion is also applicable to partially ionized gas , if the degree of ionization is larger than @xmath140 .",
    "indeed , for such high ionization degrees the alfvnic turbulence cascades to scales less than the ion - neutral decoupling scale ( see lithwick & goldreich 2001 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the degree of ionization is lower , we assume that alfvnic turbulence is fully damped by ion - neutral collisions at the scale @xmath141 , and it would not be able to provide turbulent damping for @xmath142 . as we saw in ",
    "5 the damping for slab waves with @xmath44 is provided by turbulent eddies with @xmath143 , therefore , our slab - type component arising from cr instability will protrude up to scales as large as @xmath144 .",
    "this scale could be substantially larger than the @xmath97 derived in   5 .",
    "according to lazarian , vishniac & cho ( 2004 ) the regime of viscosity damped turbulence emerges for alfvnic turbulence at scales less than @xmath141 .",
    "this regime is characterized by a shallow @xmath145 spectrum of magnetic perturbations and it persists down to the ion - neutral decoupling scale where it reverts to intermittent alfvnic turbulence that involves only ions .",
    "the detailed treatment of the interactions of crs with turbulence in partially ionized medium is beyond the scope of this paper , however .      in the paper above we considered the cr component of the ism or icm , which are the high energy particles that interact with the rest of the medium via the magnetic fields .",
    "these particles have a power - law distribution that arises from the acceleration terms that are proportional to the cr momenta . the astrophysical plasma , on the other hand , is assumed to have a maxwellian distribution and provides us with both conductivity and mass density which are required for a mhd treatment . in a fully ionized plasma particle - to - particle collisions are coulomb scattering and the rate of the collisions becomes smaller with temperature . with high temperature and small density these mean free paths can be huge .",
    "for example , in galaxy clusters it could be as large as 4kpc .",
    "this lead to apparent contradiction , as particles with such a huge mean free path will be subjected to acceleration and will not be maxwellian .",
    "schekochihin and cowley ( 2005 ) proposed that thermal particles will be scattered by instabilities .",
    "they considered hydrodynamic as well as kinetic instabilities and considered the evolution of the cluster from initial state with no magnetic field .",
    "their argument is that the reynolds number , being initially very low , will increase with increasing magnetic field and the dynamo will self - accelerate .",
    "they predict folded magnetic fields due to high - prandtl number dynamo and their mean free paths are between viscous scale and the reversal scale .    in this subsection",
    "we estimate mean free paths of thermal particles in a way similar to the rest of our paper , keeping in mind that there are quite a few other plasma effects and some mhd dynamo effects that might be important , so that these estimates are still rather speculative .",
    "this may be excused by the fact that thermal mean free path , viscosity and thermal conductivity are very important for cluster dynamics .",
    "anisotropic distributions of thermal particles will excite waves with inverse wavevectors of the order of thermal larmor radius , @xmath146  pc as the instability is exponentially slow for smaller wavevectors ( see mikhailovskii 1975 , eq .",
    "all particles will have approximately the same mean free path , and the value of @xmath147 that provides scattering will now refer to the _ total _ perturbed magnetic field , in contrast with its definition in   4 .",
    "apparently the energy - transfer arguments of  6 will be most important , as the steepening is very fast on thermal larmor scales . by equating steepening and turbulent energy transfer rates we have @xmath148 , which gives @xmath149 , @xmath150  pc .",
    "all in all , in the paper above we have demonstrated that    \\1 .",
    "turbulent compressions of magnetic field result in the kinetic instability of crs that drives alfvnic perturbations of much higher frequency with wave vectors almost parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "these alfvnic perturbations efficiently scatter and isotropize crs .",
    "the above effect is present over the limited energy range of the crs .",
    "the high energy cut - off is determined by the ambient alfvnic turbulence .",
    "the non - linear back - reaction via limiting the cr mean free path and the steepening of the generated waves control the intensity of the new slab - type alfvnic component .",
    "this intensity depends on both the amplitude of the compressible perturbations and cr pressure .",
    "the presence of linear damping of compressible motions or the strong feedback damping effect modifies the instability and results in a slightly steeper spectrum of generated alfvnic perturbations .    *",

    "let us consider transverse , circularly polarized waves with wavevector parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the dispersion relation will reduce to @xmath157 , and it has a large component @xmath158 that comes from the contribution of thermal plasma and the small component @xmath159 that comes from crs . for hydrodynamic waves with wavelengths much larger than the larmor radius in thermal plasma we have @xmath160 , where @xmath13 is the alfvnic velocity .",
    "such waves propagate along the magnetic field with velocity @xmath13 . in",
    "thermal isotropic plasma both circular polarizations of the wave have the same speed , in other words , linearly polarized waves are also eigenmodes in such plasma . with the introduction of a cr contribution to the dielectric tensor",
    "this degeneracy could be broken .",
    "for example , for the isotropic distribution of crs , `` shifted '' from the origin by some streaming velocity , the eigenmodes are linearly polarized waves which are unstable if the streaming velocity is larger than the alfvnic velocity ( see , e.g. , kulsrud & pearce , 1969 ) . if the distribution is not shifted , but oblate or prolate the eigenmodes are the circularly polarized waves which are either stable or unstable ( mikhailovskii , 1975 , kulsrud 2004 ) .    in this paper",
