    "a frequent object of interest is the ceteris paribus effect of @xmath0 on @xmath1 when observed @xmath0 is an individual choice variable partly determined by preferences or technology .",
    "panel data holds out the hope of controlling for individual preferences or technology by using multiple observations for a single economic agent .",
    "this hope is particularly difficult to realize with discrete or other nonseparable models and/or multidimensional individual effects .",
    "these models are , by nature , not additively separable in unobserved individual effects , making them challenging to identify and estimate .",
    "a fundamental idea for using panel data to identify the ceteris paribus effect of @xmath0 on @xmath2 is to use changes in @xmath0 over time . in order for changes over time in @xmath0 to correspond to ceteris paribus effects , the distribution of variables other than @xmath0 must not vary over time .",
    "this restriction is like time being randomly assigned  or `` time is an instrument . ''  in this paper we consider identification via such time homogeneity conditions .",
    "they are also the basis of many previous panel results , including chamberlain ( 1982 ) , manski ( 1987 ) , and honore ( 1992 ) .",
    "recently time homogeneity has been used as the basis for identification and estimation of nonseparable models by chernozhukov , fernandez - val , hahn , newey ( 2013 ) , evdokimov ( 2010 ) , graham and powell ( 2012 ) , and hoderlein and white ( 2012 ) . because economic data often exhibits drift over time , we also allow for some time effects , while maintaining underlying time homogeneity conditions .    in this paper",
    "we give identification and estimation results for quantile effects with time homogeneity and continuous regressors .",
    "the effects of interest are derivatives of quantile structural functions of the model .",
    "we find that these derivatives are identified with two time periods for stayers \" , i.e. conditional on @xmath0 being equal in two time periods .",
    "time homogeneity is too strong for many econometric applications where time trends are evident in the data .",
    "we weaken homogeneity by allowing for location and scale time effects .",
    "allowing for such time effects makes identification and estimation more complicated but more widely applicable .",
    "we also give analogous results for conditional mean effects under weaker identification conditions than previously .",
    "quantile identification under time homogeneity is based on differences of quantiles .",
    "it is also interesting to consider whether quantiles of differences can help identify effects of interest .",
    "we do not find that time homogeneity alone can lead to identification from quantiles of differences .",
    "we do give quantile difference identification results that restrict the distribution of individual effects conditional on @xmath0 , similarly to chamberlain ( 1980 ) , altonji and matzkin ( 2005 ) , and bester and hansen ( 2009 ) .",
    "in our opinion these added restrictions make quantiles of differences less appealing .",
    "we therefore focus for the rest of the paper , including the application , on differences of quantiles .",
    "to illustrate we provide an application to engel curve estimation .",
    "the engel curve describes how demand changes with expenditure .",
    "we use data from the 2007 and 2009 waves of the panel study of income dynamics ( psid ) .",
    "endogeneity in the estimation of engel curves arises because the decision to consume a commodity may occur simultaneously with the allocation of income between consumption and savings .",
    "in contrast with the previous cross sectional literature , we do not rely on a two - stage budgeting argument that justifies the use of labor income as an instrument for expenditure . instead , we assume that the engel curve relationships are time homogeneous up to location and scale time effects , which leads to identification of structural effects from panel data .",
    "an alternative approach to identification in panel data is to impose restrictions on the conditional distribution of the individual effect given @xmath0 .",
    "this approach leads to nonparametric generalizations of chamberlain s ( 1980 ) correlated random effects model .",
    "as shown by chamberlain ( 1984 ) , altonji and matzkin ( 2005 ) , bester and hansen ( 2009 ) , and others , this kind of condition leads to identification of various effects .",
    "in particular , altonji and matzkin ( 2005 ) show identification of an average derivative conditional on the regressor equal to a specific value , an effect they call the local average response ( lar ) . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach , preferring to impose time homogeneity rather than restrict the relationship between observed regressors and unobserved individual effects .",
    "we refer to hsiao ( 2003 ) for a broader perspective of panel data models .",
    "section 2 describes the model and gives an average derivative result .",
    "section 3 gives the quantile identification result that follows from time homogeneity .",
    "section 4 considers how quantiles of differences can be used to identify the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath2 .",
    "section 5 explains how we allow for time effects .",
    "estimation and inference are briefly discussed in section 6 , and the empirical example is given in section 7 .",
    "the appendix contains the proofs of the main results .",
    "the data consist of @xmath3 observations on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ^{\\prime } $ ] , for a dependent variable @xmath6 and a vector of regressors @xmath7 . throughout",
    "we assume that the observations @xmath8 _ _ , _ _ @xmath9 _ _ , _ _ are independent and identically distributed .",
    "the nonparametric models we consider satisfy    [ assum : model ] there is a function @xmath10 and vectors of random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13    we focus in this paper on the two time period case , @xmath14 , though it is straightforward to extend the results to many time periods .",
    "the vector @xmath15 consists of time invariant individual effects that often represent individual heterogeneity .",
    "the vector @xmath12 represents period specific disturbances .",
    "altonji and matzkin ( 2005 ) considered models satisfying assumption 1 .",
    "as discussed in chernozhukov et .",
    "2013 ) , the invariance of @xmath16 over time in this assumption does not actually impose any time homogeneity",
    ". if there are no restrictions on @xmath12 then @xmath17 could be one of the components of @xmath18 allowing the function to vary over time in a completely general way .",
    "the next condition together with assumption 1 imposes time homogeneity on the model .",
    "[ ass : distrinv ] @xmath19 for all @xmath20    this is a static , or `` strictly exogenous '' time homogeneity condition , where all leads and lags of the regressor are included in the conditioning variable @xmath21 it requires that the conditional distribution of @xmath12 given @xmath22 and @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath23 but does allow for dependence of @xmath12 over time .",
    "this assumption rules out dynamic models where lagged values of @xmath6 are included in @xmath24    setting @xmath25 , an equivalent condition is @xmath26thus , the time invariant @xmath11 has no distinct role in this model . as further discussed in chernozhukov et .",

    "although they seem useful for nonlinear models , the time homogeneity conditions are strong . in particular they do not allow for heteroskedasticity over time , which is often thought to be important in applications .",
    "we partially address this problem below by allowing for location and scale time effects .    for notational convenience we shall drop the @xmath28 subscript and let @xmath14 in the following .",

    "one intended direction is to compare the derivative of the quantiles of the differences @xmath55 to the differences of the derivative of the quantiles of @xmath53 and @xmath52 in terms of objects they identify . in what follows",
    "we carry out the comparison .    to set the stage for the quantile results",
    "we first discuss mean identification .",
    "we first give an explanation of identification of the mean effect and then give a precise result with regularity conditions .",
    "consider the identified conditional mean @xmath56together these conditional expectations are a nonparametric version of chamberlain s ( 1982 ) multivariate regression model for panel data . derivatives of them can be combined to identify the conditional mean effect .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the conditional density of @xmath58 given @xmath50 that does not depend on @xmath17 by assumption [ ass : distrinv ] .",
    "assume that @xmath59 and @xmath57 are differentiable in @xmath0 and @xmath60 respectively and that differentiation under the integral is permitted . for @xmath35 we let @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , denote the vector of partial derivatives w.r.t .  the coordinates of @xmath64 .",
    "then for @xmath63 , @xmath65where the first term is the conditional mean effect of interest and the second term is the analog to chamberlain s ( 1982 ) heterogeneity bias .",
    "subtracting and using assumption [ ass : distrinv ] gives @xmath66evaluating at @xmath67 we find that@xmath68where @xmath69it also follows similarly that @xmath70thus , the conditional mean effect is identified from the derivative of the conditional expectation of the difference with respect to the leading time period for individuals where @xmath34 is the same in both periods .",
    "we note here that this means the conditional mean effect is overidentified . introducting time effects , as we do below ,",
    "will lead to exact identification .",
    "thus , testing for the presence of time effects is one way of testing this overidentifying restriction .",
    "the importance of conditioning on the event @xmath71 can be seen from equation ( [ cond mean eq ] ) , where setting @xmath72 eliminates heterogeneity bias .",
    "thus , one can think of the conditioning on @xmath72 as a device to eliminate the heterogenity bias in nonseparable models under time stationarity .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath59 were additively separable with @xmath73 the heterogeneity bias would be zero for all @xmath74 not necessarily equal to @xmath75 because @xmath76 .",
    "hence the derivative effect of interest would be @xmath77 for each value of @xmath78 and one could estimate that derivative more precisely by averaging over its first argument .",
    "also , one could test for whether the model is additively separable by testing whether @xmath79 varies with its first argument , though it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze such tests .",
    "conditioning on @xmath71 does restrict the set over which the structural derivative is averaged but this can correspond to an interesting set of individuals .",
    "for example , in the engel curve application we give @xmath0 is total expenditure so the restriction @xmath72 corresponds to individuals whose total expenditure was the same in the two time periods .",
    "this seems mostly likely to occur for middle aged individuals , which is an interesting though special group to focus on .",
    "altonji and matzkin ( 2005 ) are able to identify derivative effects without conditioning on @xmath72 but they also restrict the distribution of @xmath58 conditional on @xmath80 we do not impose such type of assumptions but instead require time stationarity of the distribution of @xmath58 conditional on @xmath81 .",
    "the different assumptions make it hard to compare results . we prefer to focus on time stationarity in this paper , where we do not yet know whether it is possible to identify interesting effects for continuous regressors without imposing @xmath82    graham and powell ( 2012 ) consider a linear model with individual specific coefficients where @xmath83 in the scalar @xmath84 case . in this case@xmath39=e\\big[\\beta _ { 2}(u_{t})|x_{1}=x_{2}=x\\big]\\]]here we find that average slope for the stayer subpopulation with @xmath72 is identified .",

    "we identify an average slope over a smaller population for a fully nonlinear , nonparametric specification @xmath59 .",
    "the following result makes the previous derivation precise , including conditions for differentiating under integrals .",

    "however , two remarks are in order : first , it also happens to be the case that under the additional structure on the dependence the quantiles of the difference yield a new effect that we could not have obtained through differences in quantiles . in particular , for targeted policy measures it may be sensible to use subpopulations that are defined by , e.g. , first differences @xmath222 .",
    "more precisely , since individuals are often assumed to exhibit a pronounced loss aversion , i.e. , they are more much sensitive towards a negative change in their status than a positive , it is conceivable that a policy maker would be much more interested in the subpopulation for which the effect @xmath222 is negative .",
    "similarly , measures that focus on the subpopulation exhibiting large values of @xmath223 may be of interest , as high variance of @xmath194 over time may not be a desirable feature for an individual .",
    "second , with more time periods we could weaken the restrictive independence assumptions .",

    "in this section , we illustrate the results with an empirical application on estimation of engel curves with panel data .",
    "the engel curve relationship describes how a household s demand for a commodity changes as the household s expenditure increases .",
    "lewbel ( 2006 ) provides a recent survey of the extensive literature on engel curve estimation .",
    "we use data from the 2007 and 2009 waves of the panel study of income dynamics ( psid ) .",
    "since 2005 , the psid gathers information on household expenditure for different categories of commodities .",
    "the psid does not collect information on total expenditure .",
    "we construct the total expenditure on nondurable goods and services by adding all the expenses in housing , utilities , phone , child care , food at home , food out from home , car , transportation , schooling , clothing , leisure , and health .",
    "we exclude expenses in mortgage , home insurance , car insurance , and health insurance because these categories have many missing values .",
    "our sample contains @xmath348 households formed by couples without children , where the head of the household was 20 to 65 year - old in 2009 , and that provided information about all the relevant categories of expenditure in 2007 and 2009 .",
    "we focus on the commodities food at home and leisure for comparability with recent studies ( e.g. , blundell , chen , and kristensen ( 2007 ) , chen and pouzo ( 2009 , 2013 ) , and imbens and newey ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "the expenditure share on a commodity is constructed by dividing the expenditure in this commodity by the total expenditure in nondurable goods and services .",
    "endogeneity in the estimation of engel curves arises because the decision to consume a commodity may occur simultaneously with the allocation of income between consumption and savings .",
    "in contrast with the previous cross sectional literature , we do not rely on a two - stage budgeting argument that justifies the use of labor income as an instrument for expenditure . instead , we assume that the engel curve relationships are time homogeneous up to location and scale time effects , and rely on the availability of panel data . specifically , we estimate @xmath349 where @xmath194 is the observed share of total expenditure on food at home or leisure , @xmath216 is the logarithm of total expenditure in dollars of 2005 , @xmath350 and @xmath351 are location and scale time effects , @xmath352 is a vector of unobserved household heterogeneity that satisfies time homogeneity and captures both differences in preferences and idiosyncratic household shocks , @xmath353 corresponds to 2007 , and @xmath354 corresponds to 2009",
    ". the inclusion of time effects might be important to account for temporal changes in preferences and relative prices across commodities .",
    "for example , the price index of nondurable goods increased by @xmath355 between 2007 and 2009 , whereas the price indexes for food and leisure increased by @xmath356 and @xmath357 during the same period .",
    "we allow these time effects to vary with total expenditure , what gives flexibility to the model .",
    "this model does put some restrictions on interactions between prices and heterogeneity , implying that price changes only shift the location and scale of the distribution of demand .",
    "table [ table : desc_stat ] reports descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis .",
    "both total expenditure and expenditure shares display within and between household variation , with means and standard deviations that remain stable between 2007 and 2009 .",
    "the low percentage of within variation in expenditure indicates that there might be a substantial number of households with zero or little change in expenditure across years .",
    "figure [ fig : density ] plots histogram and kernel estimates of the density of the change in expenditure between 2007 and 2009 .",
    "the kernel estimates are obtained using a gaussian kernel with silverman s rule of thumb for the bandwidth .",

    "we consider two different specifications for the series basis in all the estimators : a quadratic orthogonal polynomial and a cubic b - spline with three knots at the minimum , median and maximum of total log - expenditure in the data set . both specifications are additively separable in the total log - expenditures of 2007 and 2009 .",
    "we also compute cross sectional estimates that do not account for endogeneity .",
    "they are obtained by averaging the nonparametric series estimates in 2007 and 2009 that use the same specification of series basis as the panel estimates but only condition on contemporaneous expenditure . for inference",

    "in figures [ fig : dqsfs_food_in ] and [ fig : dqsfs_leisure ] , we show that the panel estimates of the cqsf as a function of expenditure are decreasing for food at home and increasing for leisure at low values of expenditure .",

    "note , however , that we should interpret the shape of our panel estimates with caution because they formally correspond to multiple conditional qsfs and asfs as the conditioning set @xmath368 changes with @xmath0 along the curve .",

    "moreover , we find evidence of the presence of time effects and endogeneity for leisure , but not for food at home .",
    "these finding are consistent with consumer preferences where food at home is a necessity good with little effect on the marginal allocation of income between consumption and savings .",
    "leisure , on the other hand , is a superior good that affects the marginal allocation of income between consumption and savings .",
    "the engel curve relationship is stable over time for food at home , whereas it is sensitive to changes over time in preferences and relative prices for leisure .",
