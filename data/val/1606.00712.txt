    "in recent years , relativistic effects @xcite@xcite have been vastly studied .",
    "a number of the studies in the literature have shown how to calculate the observed clustering overdensity of galaxies in a relativistic context , i.e.  the relativistic galaxy overdensity  @xcite , revealing relativistic corrections to the simple newtonian calculation that is standard for low redshift , small area surveys .",
    "galaxy surveys with large volume coverage  spanning scales nearly and larger than the hubble radius , reaching high redshifts  require relativistic corrections to the observed overdensity .",
    "basically , these corrections are owing to the large - scale effects of ( i ) the gravitational potential , both local at the observed galaxies and also along the line of sight , and ( ii ) peculiar velocities , by the apparent motion of the galaxies relative to the observer ; together , these constitute the so - called `` relativistic effects '' .",
    "current optical surveys only cover low redshifts and sky area with dimensions which are smaller than the hubble radius ; thus , containing negligible relativistic effects .",
    "however , upcoming surveys in the optical and the radio / infrared , will extend to high redshifts and encompass large sky area  covering distance scales equal and larger than the horizon  providing deeper and richer information on the observable universe , but most importantly , on cosmological scales at the survey redshifts . on these scales ,",
    "the relativistic effects become significant .",
    "these effects can , e.g.  provide a means for a sensitive probe of the nature of dark energy and modified gravity : by comparing the predictions from the relativistic corrections to the observation of the forthcoming surveys .",
    "there are two fundamental issues underlying the relativistic analysis : firstly , we need to correctly identify the galaxy overdensity that is observed on the past light cone ; secondly , we need to account for all the distortions arising from observing on the past light cone , including redshift and volume perturbations ( with all relativistic effects included ) @xcite .",
    "these relativistic effects appear in the power spectrum of matter in redshift space .",
    "however , all of these effects together can suitably be accounted for  simply by using the fact that the physical ( observed ) number of the galaxies depends on two main quantities : the survey _ volume _ and the apparent _ flux _ of the sources .",
    "thus in this work , we rely on the dependence of the physical galaxy number on the survey volume and the apparent flux , to re - trace the known relativistic galaxy overdensity ( at first order perturbation ) .",
    "we recover all previously calculated terms , and yet uncover subtle , but crucial ( background ) parameters which are missed out by previous works .",
    "we start by re - calculating the relativistic galaxy overdensity  while revealing the new parameters  in sec .",
    "[ sec : rdp ] ; we relate our results to some previous works in sec .",
    "[ sec : cpr ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fvls ] we give an overview of specific ( flux- and volume - limited ) samples of galaxy surveys and , in sec .  [ sec : tlslps ] we demonstrate the possible implications of the new parameters on the large - scale prediction of galaxy clustering , via the galaxy power spectrum , in the standard concordance model .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "( we leave out the specifics on measuring the new parameters as a future project ; here we focus on their possible cosmological implications . )",
    "in cosmological surveys , observers usually look at a certain volume @xmath0 of the sky through a solid angle @xmath1 in a given direction @xmath2 , at a redshift @xmath3 away . apart from the redshift , the solid angle and the intrinsic properties of the observed sources , surveys will generically also depend on cosmic magnification via the apparent flux @xmath4 ( or luminosity ) of the observed sources  @xcite .",
    "the observed flux of a source is implicitly ( de)amplified in an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "( hereafter , we use `` magnification '' to mean _ magnification of sources _ , by the amplification of their flux and/or angular size . )",
    "thus , the physical number @xmath5 of galaxies observed in an _ arbitrary _ survey will depend on two main quantities , which are , the observed volume @xmath6 , and the apparent flux @xmath7 of the sources  i.e .  @xmath8 .    moreover",
    ", a generic sample of cosmic objects in the sky would inherently contain both `` magnified '' and `` unmagnified '' fractions , respectively ; where the magnified fraction is proportional to the magnification bias .",
    "however , the actual measurable quantity  being the number of objects per unit solid angle per redshift  would consist of all the events together , with no distinctions between these fractions .",
    "nevertheless , these fraction can each be isolated by observations , and measured separately , given that the unmagnified fraction is volume dependent , and the magnified fraction is flux dependent .",
    "thus , a given volume element @xmath9 and flux interval @xmath10 , within a specified redshift range @xmath11 and solid angle interval @xmath12 , will lead to @xmath13 galaxies : [ dn2 ] dn(,z ) & = & _ g(,z ) d(,z ) + _ _ f(,z ) df(,z ) & & _",
    "g(,z ) d_dz , where ( henceforth , a tilde denotes _ redshift space _ ) we note that the decomposition of the total differential @xmath14 , top line in , follows directly from differential calculus ( given that the observed sky volume is independent of the apparent flux from a source ) , and [ def : n_g ] _ g . |_f _ * = ^f_*_f_cutdf ( , f ) , where @xmath15 denotes a given ( maximum ) flux value ( to be specified by the experiment ) with apparent magnitude @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the instrument threshold or cut - off flux with apparent magnitude @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( varying with both volume and flux ) implicitly measures the _ flux _ or _ luminosity function _ ; with , [ def : n_f ] _ _ f .",
    "| _ _ * = ^_*__mind(,f ) , where @xmath20 denotes a given ( maximum ) volume at a specified distance @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the initial volume at a minimum distance @xmath23 ( at the observer , or another arbitrary position ) . note that , the ( ensemble ) average number of galaxies per unit volume , with flux in the infinitesimal range from @xmath7 to @xmath24 , is @xmath25 ; similarly , @xmath26 gives the average number of galaxies per unit flux , with distance ( or position ) within the volume element from @xmath6 to @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 as the _ effective _ ( or _ cumulative _ ) : galaxy number per unit volume , and galaxy number per unit flux , respectively.evaluated at a fixed flux @xmath30gives the cumulative number of galaxies per unit volume , with flux within the finite range @xmath31 , and @xmath32evaluated at a fixed volume @xmath33gives the cumulative number of galaxies per unit flux in a given finite volume @xmath34 ( or with distance within @xmath35 ) . ] ( we notice that the number density @xmath36 is evaluated at a fixed flux @xmath30 , whereas , the number density @xmath37 is evaluated at a fixed volume @xmath33 . )",
    "surveys like the sdss @xcite and the lcrs @xcite , among others , employ two flux cut - offs : the instrument threshold ( below which no source is detected ; thus , being the lower bound ) , and a certain maximum ( beyond which no source is detected ; thus , being the upper bound ) .",
    "thus , only sources with apparent magnitude in a given closed interval in a certain sky volume , are measured ; usually , the given volume will also be demarcated by two distance ( lower and upper ) limits .",
    "note that by integrating over volume , the number density @xmath37 is independent of distance ; conversely , @xmath36 depends on distance .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 , given by , is the observed galaxy number per unit solid angle per redshift  which is what observers measure .",
    "if the survey also pertains the apparent size @xmath39 of the sources , then the observed flux from a source will depend on the apparent size of that source , i.e.  @xmath40 ; whence , [ tildeng ] _",
    "g(,z ) = _ g(,z ) ( , z ) + _ _ f(,z ) ( , z ) _ _ x(,z ) , where @xmath41 is the volume per unit solid angle per redshift ; with @xmath42 being the flux change per size interval @xmath43 ( i.e.  flux per unit size ) , and @xmath44 is the source size per unit solid angle per redshift .",
    "the redshift distribution of the galaxies is obtained by averaging over all solid angles : @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the ( observed ) relativistic galaxy overdensity , is obtained by [ obzdelta ] ^obs_g(,z ) & & , + [ obzdelta2 ] & = & e__v(|z ) ( _ g(,z ) + _ _ v(,z))&+ & e__f(|z ) q(|z ) _ _ m(,z ) , where @xmath46 is the average galaxy distribution density in redshift space ( hereafter , overbars denote `` background '' quantities , averaged over all solid angles , and @xmath47 is the perturbation in the given quantity @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ) ; @xmath50 is the number density contrast , and @xmath51 is the volume density contrast . moreover , by using that for magnified sources the flux per unit source size  in the background  is proportional to the underlying magnification per unit source size , i.e.  @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 ; consequently , @xmath54 is the magnification contrast .    the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the fractional contributions by the change in volume and the change in flux , respectively , in the background sample  i.e .",
    "if the survey volume and the apparent flux are variable , then the change in volume will contribute a certain fraction @xmath57 in the average distribution density @xmath58 , and similarly , the change in flux will also contribute a fraction @xmath59which together yield the identity [ fracsum ] e__v(|z ) + e__f(|z ) = 1 , where for fixed - volume surveys ( at fixed @xmath3 ) @xmath60 , and the entire background sample is generated by the variation in flux , with @xmath61 ; of which sample is ideal for pure magnification analysis , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "( fixing the apparent flux  and / or size  leads to @xmath62 with @xmath63 ; thus , corresponding to a pure number - count analysis , see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "these parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath59 , have never previously been taken into account ( in the literature ) in the calculation of the relativistic galaxy overdensity @xmath64 .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 , is the cosmic _ magnification bias _",

    "@xcite ; with the parameter @xmath68 corresponding to a _ flux _ or _ luminosity bias _ @xcite , and",
    "@xmath69 is the apparent magnitude .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which implies that the relativistic _ number - count overdensity _ @xmath72 and the relativistic _ magnification overdensity _ @xmath73which are , separately , observable  are volume @xmath6 and flux @xmath7 dependent , respectively .",
    "( the methods given by e.g.  @xcite can be applied to measure @xmath74 . )",
    "thus , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are basically the magnified and the unmagnified parts , respectively , of the relativistic ( galaxy ) overdensity .",
    "moreover , for a given source , the surface brightness @xmath76 is a constant  and is unaffected by cosmic amplification ( or magnification ) of the source @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath77 , hence @xmath78 and we get @xmath79",
    ". however , note that if the survey does not pertain the apparent size of the source , i.e.  @xmath80 , we will have in : @xmath81 and thus @xmath82 , where @xmath83 becomes the change in flux per unit solid - angle change per redshift change .",
    "thus , @xmath84 and we get @xmath85 ; when @xmath86 , @xmath87 and , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 . (",
    "note that , given @xmath52 we get @xmath90 , up to first order , where the factor @xmath91 quantifies the cosmic ( de)magnification  see @xcite . )    thus , we rewrite the relativistic overdensity  : [ obzdelta3 ] ^obs_g(,z ) = e__v(z ) ^obs_n(,z ) + e__f(z ) ^obs__m(,z ) , where the number - count overdensity @xmath75 and the magnification overdensity @xmath74 are given in appendix  [ sec : dmd ] .",
    "note that the ( total ) relativistic overdensity @xmath64 is unique and physically defined : it does not correspond to any of the standard gauge - invariant definitions of overdensity  but it is automatically gauge - invariant  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that previous works  @xcite have  by implication  applied the division given by , i.e.  the division of a galaxy sample into separate `` volume - dependent '' and `` flux - dependent '' parts .",
    "the only difference is that ( noting difference in notation ) , in the previous works , the two respective parts are first computed _ individually _ and later merely summed directly ; however , doing so is inconsistent .",
    "for example , in the work by jeong et al @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the relativistic overdensity is computed in parts ; firstly , the pure number - count overdensity @xmath92 is computed ( see ( 40)(55 ) , by @xcite ) , accounting for the overdensity solely owing to the change in the observed volume . afterwards , by using that most real cosmic samples also depend on the apparent flux from the sources , the contribution solely owing to the variation in flux is then added ( see ( 60 ) , by @xcite ) , given by _",
    "g = _ g ( ) + q , i.e. given in the notation of @xcite , where we rightly identify @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; thus , ( mis)leading to @xmath95 .",
    "( it is worthy of note that , the results by bonvin and durrer  @xcite and by challinor and lewis @xcite , respectively , are both recovered by jeong et al @xcite . )    however , given that the physical number of sources @xmath96 implicitly depends on both the survey volume and the sources apparent flux , then by differential calculus we have the total number differential @xmath14 to be fully decomposed as given by ; thus , leading to and .",
    "this way  i.e .",
    "the approach via we give a consistent procedure for including the _ true _ effect , @xmath97 , of cosmic magnification in the relativistic overdensity @xmath64 .",
    "thus , and hence , the entire analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : rdp ] , generalize the relativistic overdensity for a _ generic _ survey , in which both the survey volume and the instrument flux are variable ( within given intervals ) .",
    "specifically , in redshift surveys ( see @xcite ) , as well as continuum surveys ( see @xcite ) , the instrument is fixed at a particular flux or intensity limit and , only above such limit can sources be detected .",
    "such surveys are called , `` threshold surveys , '' with the given limit being the instrument s `` threshold . ''",
    "essentially , implies that  contrary to previous analyses ( see  @xcite)the volume - dependent and the flux - dependent parts , respectively , of the generic relativistic overdensity do not merely add ; they are scaled down by their respective fractional contribution in the ( total ) redshift - space average distribution density .",
    "an ideal , generic survey would involve variable volume and flux , respectively .",
    "thus , as previously mentioned , the generated catalogue of the cosmic objects would inherently contain both `` magnified '' ( flux - dependent ) and``unmagnified '' ( volume - dependent ) fractions , respectively ; with the observationally measurable quantity , being the number of objects per unit solid angle per redshift , consisting of all the events together ( without any distinctions between these fractions ) .",
    "however , in practice , analyses are often done for specific samples ; usually , for either flux - limited or volume - limited samples .",
    "( these sample types are discussed subsequently . ) in order to construct or extract these samples , certain measurement limits are placed on the experiment .",
    "generally , in observational cosmology , the principal limiting parameters are usually the apparent flux and the observed ( geometric ) cosmic depth ; these invariably determine the source intrinsic brightness , i.e. luminosity . the flux is prescribed by an apparent magnitude @xmath69 ; the cosmic depth @xmath98 is given in units of distance , and the luminosity is prescribed by an absolute magnitude @xmath99 .",
    "basically , once limits , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , are placed on the apparent magnitude and the cosmic depth , respectively , the limit on the absolute magnitude is automatically determined ( via the magnitude - distance relation ) , by [ m_lim ] m_lim = m_lim - 25 - 5_10 ( d_lim ) , where , in general , @xmath100 _ needs not be _ the apparent magnitude @xmath18 of the threshold flux ( it may be any fixed value @xmath102 , depending on interest or the choice of investigation ) ; usually , @xmath103 is the luminosity distance ( measured in @xmath104 ) at a given maximum redshift @xmath105 . note that , in reality , @xmath106 may be affected by the well - known @xmath107-correction , galactic extinction , and other notable effects  especially if @xmath101 is large , i.e. at a high redshift  thus , a more general expression for @xmath106 will need to incorporate these effects  @xcite .      in flux - limited samples ,",
    "the measuring instrument is operated on a fixed flux value  serving as the instrument s threshold  and only sources with flux strictly above this threshold are extracted or detected . the flux limit is fixed by the apparent magnitude limit @xmath100 , and any source which is intrinsically brighter than the absolute limit , i.e. any @xmath108 , is extracted : [ m_lim ] m = m_lim - 25 - 5_10 ( r ) , where we notice that the absolute magnitude @xmath109 is mainly a function of the ( radial ) distance @xmath110 only ; the various sources are accessed by varying the observed distance . however , the distance is in turn , a function @xmath111 of redshift @xmath3 , so that computing @xmath110 first requires knowing the actual redshift .",
    "therefore , the experiment needs to have the sufficient resolution and sensitivity to determine @xmath3 .",
    "this way , the individual sources are differentiated , and their actual number is counted .",
    "( the instrument picks out the individual sources . )",
    "thus the given survey is automatically a `` number - count '' survey . invariably , the survey is also a `` redshift '' survey , with a catalogue consisting of sky positions and luminosities of the sources . for the this type of catalogue , in particular ,",
    "usually we have @xmath112 ; with the source sample also termed , a `` magnitude - limited '' sample .",
    "note that , by having a flux threshold , it implies that sources at higher redshifts must have higher luminosities in order to be detected by the instrument , i.e. sources at larger @xmath110 must have lower @xmath99 .",
    "( otherwise , they lead to a flux which is lower than the given instrument threshold , and are therefore filtered out . ) in fact , once the magnitude limit is applied , the flux becomes irrelevant ; the instrument no longer measures the variation in flux ",
    "it only registers the number of the individual sources which have flux above the ( instrument ) threshold .",
    "thus , the _ change in flux per unit solid - angle change per redshift change , is zero _",
    "( i.e. @xmath113 ) ; which leads to @xmath114 and , given , we have @xmath115 . then by , the given distribution is adequately described by @xmath75 ( appropriate for _ pure _ number - count analysis only , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that in order to extract or screen for the required sources , the instrument is fixed at the limit @xmath100 ; however , in order to determine the number ( density ) of these sources , the integral in must be evaluated from @xmath116 up to @xmath100 ( noting that a lower apparent magnitude corresponds to a higher flux ) .",
    "consequently , the resulting distribution ( density ) depends on the sources distance , and hence , on the sky volume @xmath117 containing @xmath110 , at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "given , it implies that intrinsically faint sources will not be detected by the the instrument , unless they are close enough ; whereas , brighter sources are detected even at large distances away .",
    "thus the given sample is _ spatially not uniform _  @xcite .",
    "besides , the sample will inherit all the factors affecting @xmath99 , which are mostly redshift - dependent ( see the discussion below , on @xmath106 ) .",
    "an ideal volume - limited survey would be one done by observing a _ fixed patch _ of the sky at a given @xmath3 , over a given period , and the flux and/or size distribution on the given sky patch is mapped .",
    "thus , at the given redshift , the _ change in volume per unit change in solid angle per change in redshift , is zero _",
    "( i.e. @xmath118 ) ; consequently , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "( such a survey would be appropriate for _ pure _ magnification analysis . )",
    "similarly , given , the generated sample is adequately described by @xmath74 .",
    "however , volume - limited samples may also be extracted from flux - limited samples .",
    "this is usually done by ( pre)specifying a maximum value @xmath101at a fixed redshift @xmath105for the depth of the cosmic volume to be investigated and , similarly , picking out only sources that are intrinsically brighter than @xmath121 ; with luminosities specified by an absolute magnitude : [ d_lim ] m = m - 25 - 5_10 ( d_lim ) , where we note that the absolute magnitude @xmath122 is mainly a function of the apparent magnitude @xmath69 only , and hence , the flux ( density ) . here",
    ", the sources are accessed by varying the apparent magnitude , and the sources in the extracted sample will be contained in a fixed volume @xmath123 . obviously , the cosmic depth @xmath101 , which only needs to be less or equal to @xmath21 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rdp ] ) , is essentially the limiting radius of the sample  where the given sources are at particular distances @xmath124 .",
    "we notice that , given , in volume - limited samples the flux limit is no longer present and all _ possible _ fluxes are mapped ( within the specified cosmic volume ) .",
    "moreover , the extracted sample is _ spatially uniform _",
    ", in the sense that the gradient of the number density vanishes , since the number density of the given sample does not vary with distance  @xcite .",
    "( note that , by , the given source distribution depends only on the flux ; the position or distance of the selected sources is irrelevant . )",
    "we investigate the three - dimensional ( 3d ) power spectrum associated with , with the main goal of showing how the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath59 affect the predictions of the large scale structure  without using any approximations , e.g.  the distant - source approximation ( @xmath125 ) , or the limber s approxiamtion  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] , it implies that for small magnification bias ( @xmath155 ) the relativistic effects , on super - horizon scales , are lower than previously predicted ( by the analysis of previous works ) .",
    "moreover , a value of e.g.  @xmath146 , implies that @xmath172 of the observed sample occur mainly owing to the magnification of the flux ( and/or angular size ) of faint background sources ; with the remaining @xmath173 ( @xmath145 ) occurring solely as a result of the variation , and/or distortion , in the survey volume .",
    "basically , @xmath172 of the observed sources have been magnified into the sample , and have a number density which varies only with flux ; the remaining @xmath173 of the sources are intrinsically bright enough to be detected , as the survey volume is varied ( and these sources have a number density which depends only on volume or distance ) .",
    "moreover , notice that throughout this work we used @xmath174 , which is reasonable for linear , gaussian perturbations . however , taking non - gaussianity @xcite into account may lead to the transformation @xmath175 ( via the relativistic magnification contrast @xmath176 ) , where @xmath177 contains the non - gaussianity ( and scale ) dependence ; thus , changing the shape of @xmath129 with respect to spatial scales @xmath153 .",
    "in general , the analysis in this work corresponds to an arbitrary survey .",
    "however , in practice , analyses are often done for specific samples : flux - limited , or volume - limited .",
    "thus , care must be taken to use the appropriate relativistic overdensity , in the large - scale analysis .",
    "a clear , straightforward reanalysis of the ( observed ) relativistic overdensity of cosmological surveys has been given .",
    "the calculation was based on the simple fact that the physical number of sources depends mainly on the survey volume and the ( source ) apparent flux ; consequently , giving a consistent approach for incorporating the effect of the cosmic magnification of sources , in the relativistic galaxy overdensity . along with",
    "already known terms , new background parameters have been uncovered , and the possible consequence of these parameters in the observed galaxy power spectrum was demonstrated  in the standard ,  universe .",
    "the new parameters separately quantify , ( i ) the fraction @xmath59 of apparently faint background sources , which have been magnified into the observed sample ( by the amplification of their flux and/or angular size ) , and ( ii ) the fraction @xmath57 of the background sources which are apparently bright enough to be observed .",
    "these parameters dictate the contributions from the magnified ( flux - dependent ) and the unmagnified ( volume - dependent ) parts , respectively , of the relativistic overdensity ; thereby regulating the amplitude of the observed ( total ) power spectrum .",
    "evidently , contrary to previous analyses , the magnified and the unmagnified parts of the relativistic overdensity , in a generic survey , do not merely add ; they are scaled down by @xmath59 and by @xmath57 , respectively .    for small positive magnification bias @xmath155 ,",
    "the magnification effect remains mostly sub - dominant at low redshifts @xmath178 ; however , this effect gradually becomes dominant on horizon scales , at high redshifts @xmath162 .",
    "moreover , for small positive magnification bias , the relativistic effects on horizon scales may be lower than previously predicted ( in the literature ) in the observed power spectrum . in other words , if these new parameters are not taken into account ",
    "if they are each set to unity , @xmath95this could lead to a false boost of the horizon - scale power , and hence an overestimation of the relativistic effects , in the observed galaxy power spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the results showed a gradual growth of the relativistic effects on horizon scales , for increasing redshift ( as already known ) ; the magnification effect also becoming prominent at higher @xmath3 .",
    "( a negative magnification bias gives mostly the reverse of the scenario for a positive bias . )    in general , for a generic survey , the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath59 can alter the predictions of galaxy clustering on all scales , and consequently , the effect of the relativistic corrections on horizon scales .",
    "however , care must be taken to use the relativistic overdensity appropriately , e.g. when considering pure number - count surveys ( @xmath115 , @xmath114 ) or pure magnification surveys ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) .",
