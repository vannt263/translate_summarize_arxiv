    "a considerable effort has recently been invested in the study of strongly - coupled thermal non - abelian plasmas by means of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . the main motivation is the hope of making contact with experimental data on the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) that has been produced at rhic @xcite and will be produced at lhc @xcite ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at our present stage of knowledge",
    ", this will be feasible only if real - world qcd can be reasonably well approximated by at least one of the various ` qcd - like ' gauge theories whose dual description is known . in the past few years , encouraging signs in this direction have emerged even for the most rudimentary example @xcite , @xmath6 @xmath0 super - yang - mills ( sym ) , which at zero temperature is completely unlike qcd , but at finite temperature is in various respects analogous to deconfined qcd .",
    "indeed , the numerical values of several properties of the sqgp appear to be in the ballpark of the corresponding ads / cft predictions for a strongly - coupled sym plasma , including its strong - to - weak - coupling entropy ratio @xcite and its ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xcite .",
    "these indications have spurred intense research on various fronts , including attempts to achieve a more realistic model of the sqgp by incorporating the effect of its expansion and/or its finite extent @xcite .",
    "much of the recent activity in this area has focused on determining the rate at which the thermal non - abelian plasma dissipates energy .",
    "the drag force experienced by a heavy quark that ploughs through a strongly - coupled @xmath0 sym plasma was determined in @xcite .",
    "the closely related heavy quark diffusion coefficient was computed in @xcite .",
    "previous related work was carried out in @xcite ; generalizations can be found in @xcite . in interesting followup work",
    ", the authors of @xcite studied the profile of the coherent gluonic fields set up by the joint quark - plasma system , which are responsible for taking energy away from the moving quark .",
    "their results appear to be consistent with phenomenological expectations of ` conical flow ' @xcite .",
    "an important measure of energy loss used in phenomenological models of medium - induced radiation ( for reviews see @xcite ) is the jet - quenching parameter @xmath7 , defined as the average squared transverse momentum transferred to the quark by the medium , per unit distance travelled .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggested that @xmath7 could be identified with the logarithm of a certain lightlike wilson loop , . ] and then used ads / cft to compute the latter for @xmath0 sym .",
    "the authors of @xcite argued that a prediction for @xmath7 in @xmath0 sym could be extracted , under certain assumptions , from their value for the drag force through use of the langevin equation .",
    "their result does not agree with that of @xcite , so there is some controversy on whether the lightlike wilson loop employed in the latter work really computes the jet quenching parameter as defined in @xcite .",
    "be that as it may , a number of subsequent works have applied the prescription of @xcite in more elaborate contexts @xcite , finding results whose qualitative form resembles that of corresponding drag forces @xcite-@xcite , even if the detailed functional form of the two sets of quantities generally disagrees .",
    "several works have also considered the case where the plasma is probed not with a single quark but with a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "such mesons were found to feel no drag force @xcite : being color - neutral , they do not set up the long - range gluonic fields that could transport energy away from them .",
    "this , however , is only true as long as the quark and antiquark are bound , which is of course made difficult by the screening effect of the plasma .",
    "the relevant @xmath8-@xmath9 potential in the presence of a strongly - coupled @xmath0 sym plasma was computed some time ago in the case where the pair is static with respect to the plasma @xcite , and recently in the more general case where the pair moves with an arbitrary velocity @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that the quark and antiquark become unbound , and consequently experience a drag force , if their separation exceeds a certain screening length whose velocity- and temperature - dependence was obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "various interesting extensions and refinements of these calculations have been performed in @xcite .",
    "as first emphasized in @xcite , the results should have implications for charmonium suppression in the sqgp .    in this paper",
    "we take yet another step along this road by considering additional moving probes of the @xmath0 sym plasma , and using the ads / cft toolbox to determine their rates of energy loss .",
    "the probe of primary phenomenological interest is a gluon , because hard partons traversing the sqgp are expected to be gluons somewhat more often than they are quarks ( in spite of which the hadrons with high transverse momentum detected after the collision come primarily from quarks @xcite ) .",
    "one of our aims in this paper is therefore to compute the drag force experienced by a heavy gluon .",
    "a sketch of how one may go about doing this using a string and an antistring was given previously in @xcite ( a related discussion may be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we will model the gluon here as a pointlike external color source in the adjoint representation . from the theoretical perspective , it is also interesting to consider probes of the plasma that transform in other representations of the @xmath6 gauge group .",
    "the technology for describing such sources in the dual ads language has been developed only recently , in the context of wilson loop computations .",
    "the recipe for calculating wilson loops in the fundamental representation has been known for a long time @xcite , and involves the identification of a string as the ads counterpart of a fundamental color source .",
    "the case of wilson loops in higher representations was discussed qualitatively already in @xcite in terms of a collection of coincident strings , but only began to be understood more systematically after the beautiful work @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that a d3-brane that carries electric flux ( i.e. , a d3-f1 bound state ) provides a more accurate description that correctly captures the effects of the interactions among the strings , which give rise to an infinite series of non - planar corrections in the gauge theory side @xcite .",
    "this idea was elaborated on in interesting ways in the three simultaneous works @xcite .",
    "the last paper , in particular , provided an elegant and complete dictionary for calculating wilson loops in an arbitrary representation , using a collection of _ either _ d3-branes _ or _",
    "d5-branes that carry electric flux . this prescription was derived explicitly in @xcite for the special case of half - bps wilson loops in zero - temperature @xmath0 sym , but given the motivation of @xcite it should apply much more generally , as has indeed been assumed in subsequent works @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the bottom line is that the results of @xcite unambiguously identify d3-branes or d5-branes with appropriate electric fluxes as the ads counterparts of the various external color sources that we wish to push through the sym plasma .    to start out with",
    ", we will employ this identification to compute the dissipative force experienced by a collection of @xmath1 quarks in the totally antisymmetric representation , which according to @xcite is dual to a single d5-brane with @xmath1 units of electric flux .",
    "arbitrary wilson loops in this same representation were calculated recently in the nice paper @xcite , and the d5-brane we need to consider here is just a particular case of the ones studied there .",
    "we begin in section [ d5sec ] by setting up the problem and working out the d5-brane embedding of interest . in the process",
    ", we discover that the constant - polar - angle d5-brane configurations ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) obtained in @xcite , which are basic building blocks in the dictionary of @xcite , are in fact incomplete : they are missing an ` end cap ' that lies at the ads boundary and whose presence is crucial to reproduce the correct energy and @xmath10 charge of the dual @xmath1-quark system .",
    "the complete d5-brane embeddings turn out to be a special case of the solutions obtained in the earlier work @xcite ; they can be described as the @xmath11 limit of ( [ lowertube ] ) .    in section [ kquarksec ]",
    "we then extract from these d5-branes the value of the drag force exerted by the @xmath0 sym plasma on their dual @xmath1-quark bound states .",
    "our result is given in ( [ fx ] ) , which contains a non - trivial @xmath1-dependence displayed in fig .",
    "[ thetakfig ] .",
    "we verify that for @xmath12 and large @xmath3 our result matches the drag force experienced by the trailing string of @xcite , but ( [ fx ] ) contains in addition an infinite series of @xmath4 corrections which in analogy with @xcite should codify self - interactions of the string , arising from worldsheets with an arbitrary number of handles .    from the gauge theory viewpoint ,",
    "a totally antisymmetric bound state of @xmath13 quarks should be equivalent to a totally antisymmetric bound state of @xmath1 antiquarks , which by the symmetry between quarks and antiquarks leads to the prediction that the force experienced by a system of @xmath1 quarks must be the same as the one felt by @xmath14 quarks , precisely as we find in ( [ fx ] ) .",
    "this implies in particular that the force vanishes for the case of the baryon , @xmath5 , which seems natural given the no - drag result for the meson @xcite .",
    "we also notice an intriguing connection between our drag force result ( [ fx ] ) for a @xmath1-quark in @xmath0 four - dimensional sym and the tension @xmath15 that governs the area law for spatial wilson loops in the same theory ( or , equivalently , the tension of a chromoelectric @xmath1-string in the _",
    "three_-dimensional non - supersymmetric _ confining _ theory associated with doubly - wick - rotated d3-branes compactified on a small thermal circle @xcite ) .",
    "the precise relation between the two quantities is given in ( [ cgsttension ] ) , which appeared previously in the proposal of @xcite relating parton energy loss to magnetic confinement .",
    "we observe that ( [ cgsttension ] ) also correctly reproduces some of the previously computed drag forces @xcite , but not others @xcite , so as we discuss around ( [ stringtension ] ) , it would be interesting to establish whether some type of generalization holds in a more general context .    in section [ gluonsec ]",
    "we finally proceed to the case of a gluon , which the dictionary of @xcite translates into a system of two d5-branes that respectively carry @xmath2 and @xmath12 units of electric flux .",
    "this system is described at tree - level by the non - abelian action ( [ nd5 ] ) plus an infinite series of corrections involving further commutators and derivatives of the fields . in the @xmath16",
    "limit the two d5-branes as expected decouple and their total energy loss rate is simply the sum of the rates of the individual branes , which is given by our previous result ( [ fx ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is that , at large @xmath3 , the dissipative force experienced by a heavy gluon is as indicated in ( [ fxgluon ] ) double the size of the one felt by a heavy quark , precisely as group theory predicts on the gauge theory side .",
    "the computation of @xmath4 corrections to this result would require knowledge of the action for the two - d5-brane system at the level of the annulus and beyond .",
    "all the color sources considered in this paper are for simplicity taken to be infinitely heavy , just like the external quark considered originally in @xcite .",
    "it should however be possible to treat the case of a gluon / baryon/@xmath1-quark with finite mass by introducing d7-branes @xcite , in parallel with what was done for the single quark in @xcite .",
    "estimates of the thermal mass of the gluon in the real - world sqgp may be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "according to the prescription of @xcite , in order to study a bound state of quarks in the totally antisymmetric representation of @xmath6 moving through a thermal @xmath0 sym plasma , we must consider a d5-brane with electric flux that lives in the ( schwarzschild - ads)@xmath17 geometry @xmath18 with self - dual ramond - ramond field strength @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the d5-brane couples to these fields through the born - infeld plus chern - simons action @xmath21~,\\\\ g_{ab}&\\equiv&\\p_a x^{\\mu}\\p_b x^{\\nu}g_{\\mu\\nu}~ , \\qquad c_{a_1\\ldots a_4}\\,\\equiv\\,\\p_{a_1}x^{\\mu_1}\\ldots\\p_{a_4}x^{\\mu_4}c_{\\mu_1\\ldots\\mu_4}~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are instructed by @xcite to search for embeddings where the d5-brane extends radially in ads@xmath22 , carries a radial electric field and wraps an @xmath23 , so it is convenient to choose the static gauge @xmath24 , and to denote @xmath25 .",
    "configurations of this type were studied previously in @xcite . as in @xcite , we require a solution where the brane moves at constant speed along direction @xmath26 , described by a general stationary ansatz @xmath27 under these circumstances , the chern - simons term in ( [ d5action ] ) will involve only the @xmath28 component of the r - r gauge field . integrating @xmath29 , we find it to be @xmath30 where as in @xcite we have defined @xmath31 notice that the value of the integration constant in this expression figures in the generalized wilson loop @xmath32 , and consequently affects the physics . just as in @xcite",
    ", we have set it equal to zero to ensure that the solutions to follow have a consistent physical interpretation .",
    ", as in @xcite , and leads to equivalent physics .",
    "[ constantfoot ] ]    plugging ( [ ansatz ] ) and ( [ c ] ) into the action ( [ d5action ] ) , the born - infeld and chern - simons terms are both found to be proportional to @xmath33 , whose integral yields the @xmath34 volume @xmath35 . making use of @xmath36 and the definition of @xmath37 in ( [ metric ] ) , we are then left with @xmath38~,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the determinant of the metric that would have been induced on the worldsheet of a _ string _ embedded in the geometry ( [ metric ] ) according to ( [ ansatz ] ) , and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath41 and @xmath42 imply that the momentum conjugate to @xmath42 is a constant , which the flux quantization condition @xcite requires to be an integer : @xmath43 where we have set @xmath44 . as is familiar from the born - infeld string context @xcite , the integer @xmath1 measures the fundamental string charge carried by the d5-brane : @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing , however , that according to ( [ pia ] ) this charge receives a contribution not only from the electric field @xmath46 that is relevant already in a trivial background , but also from the r - r four - form ( [ c ] ) . for a given value of @xmath1 , the equation of motion for @xmath47",
    "allows a solution where the d5-brane sits at a specific constant polar angle @xmath48 as long as the electric field is given by @xmath49 with the sign chosen to coincide with that of @xmath50 .",
    "notice from ( [ thetak ] ) that @xmath51 , which in ( [ esol ] ) implies that @xmath52 .",
    "this encodes the expected relation between the configurations with @xmath1 strings and @xmath1 antistrings ( i.e. , strings with opposite orientation ) , which are respectively dual to @xmath1 quarks and @xmath1 antiquarks : the corresponding d5-branes have exactly the same embedding but opposite orientation , and carry electric fields which are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "there is also a close connection between the systems with @xmath1 and @xmath14 strings / quarks : it follows from ( [ thetak ] ) that @xmath53 , meaning that the corresponding d5-branes wrap four - spheres located at the same angle @xmath54 , but measured respectively from the north and south pole of the @xmath55 , ) as in the previous footnote would simply have exchanged the role of the north and south poles.[polefoot ] ] and ( [ esol ] ) then implies that @xmath56 .",
    "the gauge theory interpretation of this symmetry will become clear below .",
    "in the extremal case @xmath57 , lorentz invariance of ( [ metric ] ) along the boundary directions guarantees that the configuration ( [ ansatz ] ) where the d5-brane moves along @xmath58 with speed @xmath59 is just a boosted version of the static solution , so we must have @xmath60 and therefore @xmath61 , i.e. , the brane remains upright .",
    "the authors of @xcite worked precisely in this case , and identified the constant - polar - angle solution ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) , first obtained in @xcite , as the ads counterpart of a bound state , in zero - temperature @xmath0 sym , of @xmath1 external quarks in the totally antisymmetric representation , moving at constant velocity @xmath59 .",
    "their identification was principally based on the fact that , just like a purely radial fundamental string , the above d5-brane embeddings preserve the same fermionic and bosonic symmetries as the required gauge theory sources : they are half - bps and invariant under a @xmath62 subgroup ( generated by @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) of the @xmath65 conformal group , as well as a @xmath66 subgroup of the @xmath67 r - symmetry group altogether , they are @xmath68 invariant .",
    "a puzzling feature of these configurations , emphasized already in @xcite , is that their energy is not proportional to their charge .",
    "we will come back to this puzzle below .",
    "interestingly , in work prior to @xcite , a seemingly different family of d5-brane configurations that are also half - bps was obtained and proposed to describe a @xmath1-quark bound state @xcite . these are also solutions of the equations that follow from the extremal version of ( [ d5actionreduced ] ) , but have a non - trivial profile @xmath69 , whose inverse was determined analytically in @xcite , @xmath70^{1/3}~,\\ ] ] with @xmath71 an arbitrary constant , and carry a corresponding electric field as dictated by ( [ pia ] ) .",
    "these solutions cover the angular range @xmath72 ( where the expression inside the brackets is positive ) and have @xmath40 decreasing monotonically from @xmath73 at @xmath74 to @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "they describe a bundle of @xmath1 fundamental strings that extend radially from the boundary at @xmath77 to the horizon at @xmath78 , pointing always towards the north pole of @xmath55 , @xmath74 .",
    "the embeddings ( [ lowertube ] ) were shown to be bps from the point of view of supersymmetry preservation in @xcite , and from the perspective of energy minimization in @xcite .",
    "they leave 16 supersymmetries unbroken , and have an energy equal to that of @xmath1 fundamental strings , supporting their identification as threshold bound states of @xmath1 quarks in @xmath0 sym @xcite .",
    "this holds for any value of the scale factor @xmath71 , which is therefore a modulus in the space of equal - energy configurations . through the standard uv - ir connection @xcite , on the gauge theory side @xmath79 is a measure of the spatial extent of the @xmath1-quark bound state , as seen most explicitly in @xcite for the case @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of solutions with arbitrary size is of course a consequence of the conformal invariance of @xmath0 sym .    given that both ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) and the one - parameter family ( [ lowertube ] ) are half - bps d5-brane configurations claimed to be dual to @xmath1-quark bound states , it is natural to wonder whether they are related in some way .",
    "an important clue in this regard comes from the fact that , although the fermionic symmetries they preserve are the same , their bosonic symmetries do not quite coincide . for general scale factor @xmath71 ,",
    "the embedding ( [ lowertube ] ) is , just like ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) , invariant under @xmath80 and @xmath81 , but not under @xmath82 , because the dilatation generator @xmath83 sends @xmath84 and consequently rescales the value of @xmath71 .",
    "the only exception to this is the case with @xmath11 ( corresponding to a gauge theory source with size @xmath85 ) , which _ is _ invariant under dilatations , and , altogether , under precisely the _ same _ @xmath68 as the constant - angle embedding found in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this agreement is plain to see : in the @xmath11 limit , the portion of ( [ lowertube ] ) lying near @xmath78 and @xmath76 is blown up to coincide _ exactly _ with ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) !",
    "the constant - angle d5 embedding obtained in @xcite is in this way understood to be a particular member of the one - parameter family of configurations found earlier in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the solution of @xcite is seen to be incomplete , because it is missing the portion of ( [ lowertube ] ) that covers the angular range @xmath86 , which is pushed by the @xmath11 limit all the way out to the ads boundary @xmath77 . to put it in more graphic language , each of the polar plots of ( [ lowertube ] ) shown in fig .",
    "1 of @xcite can be described as a small ` cone ' joined onto a long ` tube ' , and the solution ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) is obtained , after an infinite rescaling , by keeping the now infinitely large cone but ignoring the tube , which now lies at the boundary and can be thought of as an end cap for the cone .",
    "this last observation resolves the energy - charge puzzle that appeared in @xcite : once the end cap is included , the total energy of the configuration _ is _ found to be correctly proportional to its total charge , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "was misguided : the relevant charge is in all cases given by @xmath1 as in ( [ pia ] ) , and _ not _ by the total r - r flux intercepted by the d5-brane .",
    "] this clarification is particularly important in the case of the baryon , @xmath5 , where we find @xmath87 meaning that the cone ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) has collapsed to become a tensionless string , but the end cap now consists of a d5-brane fully wrapped around the @xmath55 at @xmath77 and carries an energy equal to that of @xmath3 quarks .",
    "the presence of the end cap also plays a role in explaining how the d5 embedding codifies the @xmath10 quantum numbers of the quarks . indeed , unlike the cone ( [ thetak ] ) , which lies in the northern or southern hemisphere of @xmath55 depending on whether @xmath88 or @xmath89 , the end cap included in the full solution ( [ lowertube ] ) always closes off at the _ north _ pole , correctly reflecting the fact that the d5-brane in question describes a bundle of strings ( or antistrings ) pointing towards @xmath74 , and is consequently dual to @xmath1 quarks ( or antiquarks ) which source only the specific sym scalar field that defines the polar direction of the internal space .",
    "these solutions were called ` lower tubes ' in @xcite . that same work constructed as well ` upper tube ' solutions that always close off at the _ south _ pole and describe a bundle of antistrings ( or strings ) pointing towards @xmath90 . and [ polefoot ] . ] the embedding of this type that , based on energetics , corresponds to a bound state of @xmath1 antistrings ( or strings ) , is found to consist of a cone at @xmath91 and an end cap that covers the angular range @xmath92 . by symmetry ,",
    "the angle that this ` upper ' cone makes with the south pole , @xmath93 , must coincide with the angle @xmath54 that the ` lower ' cone describing @xmath1 antistrings ( or strings ) makes with the north pole .",
    "this explains the previously mentioned connection @xmath94 , which we now recognize as the ads counterpart of the gauge - theoretic statement that a totally - antisymmetric bound state of @xmath14 quarks with a given @xmath10 charge is equivalent to a totally - antisymmetric bound state of @xmath1 _ _ anti__quarks with the _ opposite _ @xmath10 charge .    in the last few paragraphs we have focused on the extremal background , which was the arena of @xcite . since in this paper we wish to study the effects of a thermal @xmath0 sym plasma , we are mostly concerned with d5-brane embeddings in the _ non_-extremal geometry ( [ metric ] ) with @xmath95 . as we have seen above , in that case",
    "the constant - angle embedding ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) is still a solution , as was first proven in @xcite . the configurations ( [ lowertube ] ) ,",
    "on the other hand , do not admit a straightforward generalization to the non - extremal case @xcite .",
    "an important point is that the presence of the black hole in ads breaks supersymmetry and conformal invariance , so @xmath71 can no longer be a modulus , and we would _ not _ in fact expect to find a one - parameter family of solutions directly generalizing ( [ lowertube ] ) . but given that the cone ( [ thetak ] ) _ is _ a solution , it should be the case that the @xmath11 limit of ( [ lowertube ] ) in which it is contained is also a solution . to verify this one need",
    "only show that the portion of the d5-brane which is contained in the full embedding ( [ lowertube ] ) and not in ( [ thetak ] ) , i.e. , the end cap , solves the non - extremal equation of motion , but this is evidently true because this portion lies entirely at @xmath77 , where the terms in the equation arising from the non - extremality are subleading .",
    "this is then another important property that distinguishes the @xmath11 configurations from its @xmath96 siblings : among the @xmath1-quark bound states found in @xcite , it is the only one that admits a direct generalization away from the extremal case .",
    "clearly it is this embedding alone that will provide us with the pointlike ( @xmath97 ) source that we wish to drag through the thermal plasma , and for this reason in the sections to follow we will concentrate exclusively on it .",
    "in the previous section we have learned that a bound state of @xmath1 quarks in the totally antisymmetric representation moving through a thermal @xmath0 sym plasma is described in dual language by a d5-brane on ( schwarzschild - ads)@xmath17 whose @xmath69 profile is given by the @xmath11 limit of ( [ lowertube ] ) , which consists of two parts : the ` cone ' ( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) , which extends from the horizon @xmath98 to the boundary @xmath77 , and an ` end cap ' located at the boundary and covering the angular range @xmath86 . as we have seen , the inclusion of this end cap is important to reproduce the correct energy and @xmath10 charge of the system of @xmath1 quarks , and in fact the _ same _ cone , with a @xmath99 end cap , is dual to a bound state of @xmath14 antiquarks .",
    "we would now like to determine the force @xmath100 with which this d5-brane must be pulled to maintain its velocity , which is mapped by ads / cft into the drag force experienced by the @xmath1-quark ( or @xmath13-antiquark ) . as in @xcite",
    ", this force will be non - zero only if the moving d5-brane leans back , i.e. , if the function @xmath101 describing the profile ( [ ansatz ] ) of the d5-brane in the direction of motion is non - trivial . since the end cap lies only at the boundary , for the purpose of determining this profile we need only concentrate on the conical portion of the solution .    for the cone",
    "( [ thetak])-([esol ] ) , the equation of motion for @xmath102 that follows from ( [ d5actionreduced ] ) is easily seen to be the same as the one that would be obtained from the nambu - goto lagrangian @xmath103 , which describes a _ string _ embedded in ( schwarzschild - ads)@xmath22 according to ( [ ansatz ] ) , with fixed @xmath104 .",
    "this is just a particular case of the result obtained in @xcite , where it was shown that , given _ any _ solution to the equations of motion for a string that reaches the boundary of an asymptotically ads@xmath22 spacetime @xmath105 , one can obtain a one - parameter family of valid d5-brane embeddings on @xmath106 ( where the sphere is threaded by @xmath3 units of r - r flux ) , simply by taking the d5 to carry @xmath1 units of electric flux and wrap the @xmath23 at polar angle @xmath76 . based on this general result , the drag force we obtain below in the context of @xmath0 sym should also be relevant for _ any _ thermal gauge theory with a dual description in terms of type iib string theory on @xmath106 .    because the reduced dynamics coincides with that of a string ,",
    "the situation is exactly the same as the one examined in @xcite : for stationary configurations of the type ( [ ansatz ] ) , the equation of motion for @xmath102 implies that the conjugate momentum density @xmath107 is a constant , and there is a critical radius @xmath108 below which the solution is found to be real only if the factor within parentheses takes the precise value @xmath109 .",
    "this then fixes the value of the momentum density ( [ pix ] ) , which measures the rate at which @xmath58-momentum flows radially along the d5-brane , away from the boundary and towards the horizon . to keep it moving at constant velocity @xmath59 along direction @xmath58",
    ", an external agent must supply to the d5-brane precisely this amount of linear momentum at the boundary , i.e. , it must exert a force of magnitude ( [ pix ] ) .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary established in @xcite , the force exerted on the d5-brane translates into the drag force experienced by a system of @xmath1 quarks ( or @xmath14 antiquarks ) in the totally antisymmetric representation that ploughs through a thermal @xmath0 sym plasma . through use of the relations @xmath110 and @xmath111 , this dissipative force",
    "may be written in the final form @xmath112 which is our main result in this section .",
    "the momentum flow ( [ fx ] ) from the moving @xmath1-quark to the plasma implies a corresponding energy loss rate @xmath113 ( which can also be inferred directly from the d5-brane momentum density @xmath114 ) .",

    "[ thetakfig ] , and is such that @xmath118 , exhibiting the expected symmetry between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "this implies in particular that the bound state of @xmath3 quarks , the baryon , must feel the same force as a system with no quarks at all , which is to say that @xmath119 .",
    "we thus learn that , at this level of approximation , the baryon can traverse the plasma without suffering any energy loss .",
    "this is the same conclusion as was reached for the meson in @xcite .",
    "the reason in both cases is the same : neither of these color - neutral sources are able to set up the long - range gluonic fields that are responsible for carrying energy away from the @xmath1-quarks with @xmath120 , as has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "in fact , for @xmath5 the angle ( [ thetak ] ) becomes @xmath90 , meaning that the ` conical ' part of the d5-brane has closed off and become tensionless .",
    "since it is this portion that codifies the gluonic fields set up by the @xmath3-quark system , we conclude that our pointlike baryon produces no field at all .",
    "it is in effect described solely by the d5 ` end cap ' at the ads boundary , which in this case is completely wrapped around @xmath55 , and is able to move unimpeded because , lying at @xmath77 , it is unaffected by the presence of the horizon .",
    "it is instructive to consider the case of a single quark , @xmath12 ( or a single antiquark , @xmath2 ) , where the d5-brane lies at a polar angle @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) which according to ( [ thetak ] ) is given by @xmath123 . for @xmath124",
    ", this implies that @xmath125 , so as required the drag force @xmath126 agrees with the one obtained in @xcite ( the factor inside the parentheses in ( [ fx ] ) ) , whose computation was carried out at string tree - level , and therefore applies in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "based on the results of @xcite , it is tempting to speculate that the finite @xmath3 corrections to this result that can be deduced from the d5-brane drag force ( [ fx ] ) encode higher - order corrections that arise from self - interactions of the string . more generally , if we hold @xmath1 fixed in the large @xmath3 limit , it follows from ( [ fx ] ) that @xmath127 and we would expect the second and higher terms to capture the effect of the interactions of the @xmath1 quarks among themselves .",
    "notice that the first correction is negative , meaning that , at finite @xmath128 , the @xmath1-quark loses energy at a somewhat smaller rate than @xmath1 unbound quarks .",
    "it should of course be borne in mind that , since unlike @xcite we are not working in a supersymmetric context , there might be additional finite-@xmath3 contributions arising from string - loop corrections to the background ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the @xmath117 prefactor seen in our drag force result ( [ fx ] ) also appeared in the wilson loop calculation of @xcite .",
    "this is evidently not surprising from the string theory perspective , because both calculations use the same d5-brane embedding , the sole difference being that the value of the wilson loop receives a contribution not only from the action ( [ d5actionreduced ] ) but also from various boundary terms that are responsible for yielding a finite answer @xcite .",
    "the agreement is even more unsurprising from the gauge theory viewpoint , because both quantities refer to the same type of external source in the same thermal gauge theory .    what we do find interesting is that the very same factor @xmath117 showed up as well in @xcite , which dealt with a problem that from the field theory perspective would appear to be completely different : the computation of flux tube tensions @xmath15 in the confining three - dimensional gauge theory that is obtained by dimensionally reducing wick - rotated d3-branes on a supersymmetry - violating circle ( in parallel with the d4-brane discussion of @xcite ) .",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite by splitting a baryon into two groups of @xmath1 and @xmath14 quarks ( or equivalently , @xmath1 quarks and @xmath1 antiquarks ) , thereby producing a long chromoelectric flux tube , a qcd @xmath1-string , in between .",
    "the dual description for this split baryon involves a d5-brane ( as inferred from the picture developed for @xmath0 sym in @xcite ) , and the portion of this brane that is dual to the flux tube turns out to lie precisely at the polar angle ( [ thetak ] ) , which explains , from the string theory side , the agreement with our result .",
    "the precise relation between the quantities computed here and in @xcite is @xmath129 where it is seen that the force and the tension have identical dependence on @xmath1 , @xmath3 , the t  hooft coupling and the temperature . using a fundamental string instead of a d5-brane",
    ", the authors of @xcite found this same relation to hold in the particular case @xmath12 , @xmath16 .",
    "they interpreted @xmath15 directly in the four - dimensional sym theory as the tension controlling the area law for _ spatial _ wilson loops @xcite , and used the fact that such loops codify the magnetic interaction between two current wires to argue that the agreement ( [ cgsttension ] ) reflects the magnetic origin of the drag force .",
    "we will return to this point below .",
    "the computation of the @xmath1-string tension in @xmath130-dimensions is an important problem in the study of confining gauge theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews , and the works @xcite for related ads / cft calculations ) , and it would be worth exploring whether the connection obtained here and in @xcite with a drag force calculation in @xmath131 dimensions holds more generally .",
    "for instance , the simple @xmath132 scaling of the flux tube tension found in @xcite for the four - dimensional yang - mills theory obtained from d4-branes @xcite suggests an identical scaling for the rate of parton energy loss in the corresponding five - dimensional thermal plasma .",
    "notice that the former quantity is static , whereas the latter is dynamical , so if one could establish a relation of the type ( [ cgsttension ] ) in a more general setting , it would in particular become possible to access information on energy loss from flux tube calculations on the lattice .",
    "a formula like ( [ cgsttension ] ) would also greatly facilitate the ads / cft computation of parton energy loss in other theories , because on the geometry side the value of @xmath15 is simply given by the tension of a string / brane that is localized in time and lies at the stationary limit surface @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "in the case of a source in the fundamental representation , which is modelled with a fundamental string , this amounts to @xmath135 ( with @xmath136 the string frame metric ) .",
    "we have checked that when inserted in ( [ cgsttension ] ) , this correctly reproduces the drag force computed in some cases @xcite , but not in others @xcite , which generally involve non - trivial background fields other than the metric . in particular , the @xmath59-dependence of the actual drag force can be much more complicated than @xmath137 , so the desired generalization of ( [ cgsttension ] ) , if it exists at all , should involve a prescription for correctly determining this dependence .",
    "given that in the drag force calculations a central role is played not by the stationary limit radius @xmath138 but by the velocity - dependent radius @xmath139 , it is natural to expect a relation between @xmath100 and the tension of a spacelike string ( or brane ) localized at the latter radius .",
    "and indeed , working on an arbitrary background as in @xcite one can prove that in all cases @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the tension of a string worldsheet extended along @xmath142 and localized at @xmath143 , @xmath144 , with @xmath145 the coordinates in the @xmath8-@xmath9 rest frame and @xmath139 the radius where @xmath146 .",
    "this last condition shows that @xmath139 marks the location of the stationary limit surface of the black brane _ as seen by an observer at rest in the @xmath145 frame _ ( and so in particular agrees with @xmath138 when @xmath147 ) .",
    "all of this strongly suggests that ( [ stringtension ] ) is the desired generalization of the force - tension relation ( [ cgsttension ] ) .",
    "but for this to be useful , a simple gauge - theoretic interpretation should be found for the tension @xmath148 , which has thus far been defined only on the ads side .",
    "the natural guess that it controls the area law for a spatial wilson loop extended along @xmath142 turns out to be incorrect , because the @xmath149-shaped string that would be employed on the ads side to compute such a loop descends beyond @xmath139 and all the way down to @xmath138 as the loop becomes large .",
    "this casts some doubt on the proposal of @xcite , because ( [ cgsttension ] ) appears to work only in those cases where the background is such that @xmath150 happens to be proportional to @xmath148 .    in any event",
    ", it should be noted that the observation made in @xcite and the present paper that the information on the rate of parton energy loss can ( at least in some cases ) be extracted from a _ spatial _ wilson loop is reminiscent of the proposal of @xcite for computing the jet - quenching parameter using a _ lightlike _ wilson loop , and in fact lends credence to the idea that the latter is to be regarded as a limit of a",
    "_ spacelike _ loop traced by a pointlike source",
    "whose velocity approaches the speed of light _ from above",
    "notice , however , that the loops discussed here and in @xcite explore different regimes : whereas the magnetic area law ( @xmath151 ) is found to hold for wide loops ( @xmath152 ) , the ` dipole approximation ' ( @xmath153 ) that inspired @xcite is valid only for narrow loops ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "it might prove worthwhile to investigate in detail the possible extrapolation between these two regimes , hopefully shedding light on the meaning of ( [ stringtension ] ) in the process .",
    "it would also be interesting to extend our drag force calculation to the case of external sources in representations other than the totally antisymmetric one .",
    "the simplest example would be a system of @xmath1 quarks in the totally symmetric representation , which according to the dictionary of @xcite is dual to a d3-brane that carries @xmath1 units of fundamental string charge .",
    "the equations that determine the relevant d3-brane embedding are much more complicated than the ones for the d5-brane , so regrettably we must leave their analysis to future work .",
    "according to @xcite , in the same way we represent @xmath1 quarks in the totally antisymmetric representation as a d5-brane with @xmath1 units of fundamental string charge , we can think of a gluon ( a source in the adjoint representation ) as two parallel d5-branes , carrying @xmath12 and @xmath2 units of fundamental string charge respectively .",
    "the dynamics of this system is described by some @xmath155 action whose full form is not yet known . to date , the most complete proposal is that of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath156 + 2\\pi{\\alpha } ' f_{\\mu\\nu }   \\right)\\det(q^i_j ) } \\right ) } \\nonumber\\\\ { } & { } & + t_p\\int{{\\mathop{\\rm tr}}\\left(p\\left[e^{i2\\pi{\\alpha } ' \\textrm{i}_\\phi \\textrm{i}_\\phi}(\\sum c^{(n)}e^b ) \\right]e^{2\\pi{\\alpha } '   f }   \\right ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath157e_{kj},\\ ] ] @xmath158 $ ] is the general formula for the non - abelian pullback and @xmath159 denotes the interior product by @xmath160 regarded as a vector in the transverse space .",
    "the gauge field is now non - abelian and the scalars @xmath161 belong to the adjoint @xmath155 representation . as first noticed by @xcite , all derivatives in the action",
    "are replaced by covariant derivatives .",
    "furthermore , all the bulk fields are functionals of the non - abelian scalars . as in the abelian case ,",
    "these fields are interpreted in terms of a taylor expansion , however , the transverse displacements are now matrix - valued , so the action would be given by a non - abelian taylor expansion @xcite .    finally , the gauge trace in ( [ na ] ) is meant to be implemented as was first proposed in @xcite , taking the totally symmetrized product of all non - abelian expressions of the form @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 $ ] . this prescription correctly yields the @xmath165 and @xmath166 interactions , but seems to require modifications at order @xmath167 and higher @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming is related to the fact that the prescription of dropping all interactions involving derivatives of the field strength , as one does in the abelian born - infeld action , is ambiguous in the non - abelian theory because of the commutators that involve the gauge fields .    in our particular case , where @xmath168 , @xmath169 and the spacetime metric ( [ metric ] ) is diagonal , ( [ na ] ) reduces to : @xmath170 + 2\\pi{\\alpha } ' f_{\\mu\\nu } \\right)}-\\left(2\\pi{\\alpha}'f_{(2)}\\wedge p[c_{(4 ) } ] \\right)_{0\\cdots 5 } \\right ] } \\ ] ] with @xmath171=g_{\\mu\\nu}+g_{ij}d_{\\mu}x^id_{\\nu}x^j \\qquad f_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu}a_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}a_{\\mu}+i\\left[a_{\\mu},a_{\\nu } \\right]\\ ] ]    upon expanding both terms in ( [ nd5 ] ) to get a polynomial expression in the fields , it is easy to show that , after taking the trace , all the off - diagonal elements ( @xmath172 or @xmath173 ) of the fields always appear in pairs .",
    "it is therefore consistent with the equations of motion to set all these elements equal to zero .",
    "furthermore , all interactions between diagonal terms of type @xmath174 and @xmath175 involve also off - diagonal elements , and consequently setting the latter to zero turns off these interactions .",
    "so , at this order , the two d5-branes do not see one another , and we can work directly with two copies of the abelian equations of motion .",
    "it is important to notice that the above result applies in fact not only for the specific action ( [ na ] ) , but also for whatever action codifies the complete tree - level d - brane interactions .",
    "the reason is that this action arises from disk diagrams , where the presence of a single boundary ( responsible for the appearance of a single trace ) forces each @xmath172 vertex to be paired with a @xmath173 vertex , and allows insertion of @xmath174 and @xmath175 vertices in a single diagram only in conjunction with at least one of these off - diagonal pairs .    at this point",
    ", we can use our results from section [ kquarksec ] .",
    "we have two decoupled d5-branes , one with @xmath12 and the other with @xmath2 units of electric flux . using equation ( [ fx ] )",
    "we then get the net drag force on the gluon , @xmath176 this result is in agreement with what is expected from the gauge theory side .",
    "the basic point is that , just from the feynman rules for the three - point qcd vertices , one finds that the probability for a parton to radiate a gluon is proportional to the quadratic casimir in the relevant representation of the @xmath6 group , @xmath3 if the parton is a gluon and @xmath177 if it is a quark .",
    "the same group - theory factor appears in the more complicated calculations of parton energy loss @xcite , and for this reason the relative factor between the gluon and quark energy loss rate is expected to be @xmath178 @xcite , at least in the perturbative regime . in the large @xmath3 limit , this reduces to a factor of 2 , just as we have found here . in the real - world @xmath179 case ,",
    "the factor is not quite 2 but 2.25 .",
    "our result should receive @xmath4 corrections , which must come from calculations at higher order in string loops .",
    "starting at the level of the annulus , the presence of multiple boundaries ( which results in multiple traces ) allows simultaneous insertions of @xmath174 and @xmath175 vertices without the appearance of off - diagonal modes ( which still come in pairs , and so can consistently be set to zero ) , meaning that we can no longer treat each d5-brane independently .",
    "these diagrams are suppressed by powers of @xmath180 , which for fixed @xmath181 is equivalent to powers of @xmath4 .",
    "it would be interesting to work out these corrections , but it would require explicit knowledge of the higher - order form of the non - abelian action .",
    "we thank alejandro ayala , eleazar cuautle , antonio garca , martn kruczenski and guy paic for very valuable discussions and for pointing out several useful references .",
