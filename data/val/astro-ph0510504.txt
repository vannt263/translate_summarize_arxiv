    "the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is one of the principal constraints on the growth of supermassive black holes over the age of the universe ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "ideally , we would measure the bolometric luminosity function of all agns as a function of redshift .",
    "this is not trivial , as it requires deep multiwavelength data spanning x - ray to sub - mm wavelengths and sampling large comoving volumes . in practice ,",
    "surveys select subsets of agns in relatively narrow wavelength ranges . for example , optical quasar surveys generally select quasars with blue spectral energy distributions and broad emission lines .",
    "while using a narrow wavelength range as a proxy for bolometric luminosity would appear risky , this approach seems to have been remarkably successful .",
    "optical , radio , and x - ray luminosity functions of agns infer a @xmath11 peak in the space density of the most luminous quasars ( e.g. , dunlop & peacock 1990 ; ueda et  al . 2003 ; croom et  al .",
    "this agreement is reassuring , since the three selection methods have different biases  strong radio emission only occurs in a small subset of all agns , optical wavelengths are sensitive to dust absorption , and soft x - ray wavelengths are sensitive to gas absorption .",
    "it is the absorption of radiation by the gas and dust surrounding the black hole that creates the greatest systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , unified models of agns ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) assume the presence of obscuring material with a non - isotropic spatial distribution that makes the observed spectrum a function of viewing angle . in unified models of agns ,",
    "the obscuring material is often referred to as the torus , though the actual distribution of gas and dust may be significantly more complex and its properties could depend on luminosity , time or eddington factors ( e.g. , lawrence 1991 ; hopkins et  al . 2005 ) . when agns are viewed from above the torus , optical continuum and broad emission lines associated with regions near the central black hole can be observed directly . when agns are viewed in the plane of the torus , optical continuum and the broad emission lines are absorbed .",
    "selection biases due to absorption by dust or gas are minimized by selecting agns in the infrared . in this paper",

    "this allows us to identify quasars that would be missed in optical surveys either because of extinction or because the quasars have optical colors typical of main sequence stars .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : surveys ] we describe the surveys used to produce the quasar sample . in  [ sec : t1 ] we characterize the sample , discuss its completeness and compare it to other selection methods available for the field . in  [ sec : lf ] we derive the luminosity function of the type i quasars in the sample , and in  [ sec : obscured ] we discuss the role of type ii quasars .",

    "an empirical psf was constructed from the brightest objects found in our mosaic , and it was subsequently fitted to all the sources detected in the map . allowing for multiple - match fitting to deal with blended cases , we derived the flux density of each source from the scaled fitted psf and finally applied a slight correction to account for the finite size of the modeled point spread function .",

    "the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , kochanek et al . in preparation ) is obtaining complete spectroscopic samples of galaxies and quasars selected over a broad range of wavelengths in the botes field of the ndwfs .",

    "these have less artifacts and slightly better photometric calibrations than the earlier catalogs .",
    "the spectra are mostly from ages internal release 1.1 with some additional spectra of @xmath45-band selected targets from ages internal release 2.0 .",

    "we have used the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr4 ; adelman - mccarthy 2005 ) for the photometry and classifications .",
    "we excluded sources with @xmath54 counterparts within @xmath55 of @xmath56 usno - a2 stars ( monet et  al .",
    "1998 ) where our ability to detect faint optical counterparts is compromised .",

    "2005 ; martnez - sansigre et  al .",
    "type i quasars have relatively bright optical counterparts and mostly compact optical morphologies .",
    "ages spectroscopic redshifts are available for 63% of the @xmath46  mjy sources and 92% of the @xmath12 sources satisfying the ages selection criteria .",
    "we define our type i quasar sample to be @xmath12 sources brighter than @xmath53 with @xmath62 compact optical counterparts .",
    "the compact optical morphology is due to the observed optical emission being dominated by a relatively unobscured agn .",
    "our sample is incomplete for @xmath32 quasars and seyferts , where agn host galaxies are sometimes resolved in the ndwfs imaging and agn host galaxies can contribute significantly to the observed @xmath12 flux .",
    "the bluest spectroscopic quasar in our sample has a color of @xmath63=2.5 $ ] ( where @xmath63 $ ] is the apparent color in @xmath17 magnitudes ) , so we have excluded @xmath63<2 $ ] sources from the sample with the expectation that this will not effect the sample completeness for highly luminous quasars . of the 47 objects excluded with this color criterion , 90% are brighter than @xmath64 and are almost certainly stars .",
    "ages spectroscopy identified 20 @xmath32 galaxies which were erroneously classified as compact in the ndwfs , and they were reclassifed as extended and excluded from the quasar sample .",
    "two @xmath34 @xmath33 quasars which were classified as extended in the optical imaging have been added to the quasar sample .",
    "the final sample contains 292 quasars and quasar candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : dndz ] shows the redshift distribution of the 270 objects in the sample with ages spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "all the quasars without redshifts are at @xmath65 ( or are blends with @xmath65 objects ) , as they all have @xmath49 detections indicating that the lyman limit is within or blueward of our @xmath49 filter .",
    "the vast majority ( 83% ) of the quasars with spectra and 59% of the candidates without spectra have one or more photons in the xbotes  chandra imaging survey ( murray et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast only 23% of the @xmath32 galaxies with @xmath66 are detected in xbotes .",
    "quasar candidates without spectra have the same likelihood ( @xmath67 ) of having @xmath68 counterparts ( from de vries et  al .",
    "2002 ) as spectroscopically confirmed quasars .",
    "we therefore expect most of the 22 quasar candidates without spectra to be quasars .",
    "while our @xmath45-band spectroscopic flux limit is less sensitive to extinction than standard ultraviolet excess ( uvx ) searches , it still corresponds to the rest - frame ultraviolet emission of the quasars .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : colr ] , the apparent colors and magnitudes of quasars show some evidence for obscuration since fainter quasars tend to have redder colors that could be explained by modest amounts of extinction .",
    "this is consistent with modest dust reddening producing the broad red tail of type i quasar colors ( e.g. , richards et  al . 2001 ) .      as a check of our sample completeness and to compare our selection criteria with traditional optical surveys , we compared our sample to a sample of uvx quasar candidates .",
    "these were selected using the criteria of the 2df - sdss luminous red galaxy and quasar survey ( 2slaq ; richards et  al .",
    "2005 ) and sdss dr4 imaging catalogs , which overlap almost all of the botes   field .",
    "the 2slaq criteria do not include morphology cuts for most objects , but do include optical color cuts which limit the ability of 2slaq to detected reddened and @xmath69 quasars .",
    "we restricted the comparison to @xmath70 quasars because at fainter magnitudes the blue quasars will tend to have @xmath71  mjy ( see figure  [ fig : colr ] ) . of the 46 @xmath70 uvx candidates in botes , 38 ( 83% )",
    "are in our @xmath2 quasar sample . the remaining @xmath70 uvx candidates are starburst galaxies or @xmath72 quasars whose host galaxies are detected in the ndwfs imaging ( and are classified as extended sources ) .",
    "our @xmath2 quasar sample is therefore highly complete for type i quasars selected with the uvx technique , particularly at @xmath33 where quasar hosts are unresolved in the ndwfs imaging .",
    "we now consider the completeness of uvx surveys for quasars selected via their @xmath12 flux . of the 23 @xmath70 quasars with @xmath73 in our @xmath12 sample , 19 ( @xmath74 )",
    "are selected by the 2slaq uvx criteria .",
    "the four @xmath73 quasars not selected by the 2slaq criteria all have red colors ( @xmath75 and @xmath63>3.7 $ ] ) .",
    "given the problems of small number statistics , this is consistent with the estimate of 90% completeness for the uvx selected quasars from the 2qz catalog by ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : sdss ] , the completeness of the uvx samples of quasars above a fixed infrared flux is lower .",
    "this is relevant for understanding the accretion history of quasars as the infrared is almost certainly more strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity than the ultraviolet .",
    "if we select the 142 @xmath73 quasars brighter than @xmath53 at @xmath12 , we find 79% are selected by the 2slaq criteria .",
    "the quasars not selected by the 2slaq criteria are sometimes optically blue and faint , but generally they are red .",
    "the median apparent colors of the 30 @xmath73 not selected by the 2slaq criteria are @xmath76 and @xmath63=4.62 $ ] .",
    "clearly , there is a significant population of bolometrically luminous red type i quasars which are mostly undetected by traditional uvx quasar surveys .",
    "red type i quasars comprise @xmath7 of the type i quasar population .",
    "we can also check the consequences of including only compact sources in our sample .",
    "this criterion certainly removes type ii quasars from the sample , as their optical emission is dominated by their host galaxies , but it will also remove @xmath32 type i quasars from our sample when their host galaxies are detected in the deep ndwfs images .",
    "thus , when we evaluate the quasar luminosity function in ",
    "[ sec : lf ] , we restrict the analysis to @xmath33 quasars .",
    "ages targeted both compact and extended @xmath77 sources , so for this magnitude range we can estimate the incompleteness due to compact selection criteria .",
    "of 130 @xmath2 sources with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , only two quasars ( 1.5% ) were classified as extended sources .",
    "these objects have been added to our spectroscopic quasar sample .",
    "one is close to a foreground star while the other is a blend with a galaxy , which may or may not be physically associated with the quasar . at @xmath78 , we assume the @xmath33 quasar sample is 1.5% incomplete due to quasars being classified as extended in the optical imaging .",
    "thus , the morphology cut should only affect the sample completeness at levels well below our statistical uncertainties .",
    "we can see in figures  [ fig : dndm ] and  [ fig : colr ] that the vast majority of @xmath66 type i quasars are brighter than our spectroscopic limit of @xmath79 and have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the number of @xmath66 type i quasars is clearly decreasing with increasing magnitude at @xmath58 . unlike uvx criteria",
    ", our selection criteria do not intrude into the main locus of type i quasar colors .",
    "we can use a relatively simple model of the spectroscopic completeness , and our estimate of the luminosity function is not particularly sensitive to changes in this model .    to model the spectroscopic completeness",
    ", we assume the distribution of rest - frame @xmath63 $ ] colors for @xmath33 type i quasars is neither a function of luminosity or redshift .",
    "we measure this distribution using the observed colors of @xmath33 quasars and @xmath80-corrections derived from the higher mid - infrared ( mir ) flux quasar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ( 2005 ) .",
    "when spectroscopic redshifts are unavailable , we estimate photometric redshifts by searching for the nearest neighbor in color - space with a spectroscopic redshift . as shown in figure  [",
    "fig : colz ] , the apparent @xmath63 $ ] colors of quasars are a weak function of redshift so relatively inaccurate photometric redshifts can be used to determine rest - frame colors ( but not luminosities ) .",
    "type i quasars fainter than @xmath81 are not included in our sample , as they are not classified as compact sources .",
    "we include a completeness correction for these objects by assuming their color distrbution is identical to quasars with higher @xmath12 fluxes and that the shape of their @xmath12 number count distribution is identical to that of bluer quasars .",
    "we estimate there are four @xmath33 type i quasars fainter than @xmath81 , and include this in our completeness estimates though this has little effect on our measured luminosity function .",
    "our estimate of the rest - frame @xmath63 $ ] distribution for @xmath33 quasars is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "to derive the distribution of apparent @xmath45-band magnitudes as a function of both @xmath12 flux and redshift , we used this model and applied the @xmath80-corrections derived from the higher mir quasar sed of ( 2005 ) .",
    "we multiplied the distribution of @xmath45-band magnitudes by the measured completeness of as a function of @xmath45-band magnitude to determine the spectroscopic completeness of the sample as a function of @xmath12 flux and redshift .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : comp ] , the spectroscopic completeness peaks at a @xmath12 flux of @xmath82 , which corresponds to @xmath77 where the ages spectroscopic completeness plateaus at @xmath83 .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness then declines to @xmath84 at both @xmath53 ( because of the unmeasured redshifts ) and at @xmath85  mjy ( because of the ages @xmath54 criterion ) .",
    "the luminosity function of quasars is one of the principal constraints on the accretion history of the most massive blackholes ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) . at the highest luminosities the fraction of type ii quasars",
    "is thought to be low ( e.g. , ueda et  al .",
    "2003 ; hao et  al . 2005 ) , although current studies do not include radio - quiet quasars obscured in both the optical and x - ray . if there are few type ii quasars at very high luminosities then the type i quasar luminosity function provides a good approximation of the overall quasar space density at the highest luminosities .",
    "we evaluate the luminosity function using 183 @xmath33 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts . as discussed earlier",
    ", the deep ndwfs images can sometimes detect the host galaxy of @xmath32 quasars so modeling the completeness would require a detailed treatment of star / galaxy classification as a function of quasar luminosity , host luminosity , host morphology and image quality .",
    "several @xmath32 extended objects are classified as broadline agns by the ages pipeline and are not included in our sample of 292 type i quasars .",
    "the present sample does not include @xmath86 quasars because of the bright @xmath45-band magnitude limit . in the 2005 ages sample , which uses a fainter @xmath50-band selection criterion ,",
    "appreciable numbers of @xmath86 quasars are found , but they are fainter than @xmath87 .",

    "using a bluer quasar sed template , derived from 35 sdss quasars in the swire elais - n1 field ( hatziminaoglou et  al . 2005 ) , alters the absolute magnitudes of individual quasars by only a few tenths of a magnitude , our luminosity function parameters by @xmath92 , and our conclusions little .",

    "we estimate the luminosity function using the maximum likelihood method of ( 1983 ) .",
    "we assume the luminosity function is a power - law of the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant and @xmath98 describes the pure luminosity evolution of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "this can also be written as a function of absolute magnitude ; @xmath99 } dm.\\ ] ] optical surveys generally require models where the slope of the luminosity function becomes shallower for low luminosity quasars ( e.g. , schmidt & green 1983 ; boyle , shanks , & peterson 1988 ; croom et  al .",

    ", we have no difficulty finding quasars at @xmath104 ( where the optical colors match those of main sequence stars ) , so we can track the evolution of the luminosity function through its peak .",
    "this forces us to add the @xmath105 term to the polynomial so that the evolution on the high redshift side of the peak is not forced to be identical to that on the low redshift side of the peak by the symmetry of the equation .",

    "our luminosity function is not as steep as the bright - end of the 2qz luminosity function .",
    "however , we are measuring quasars that are slightly brighter than the break in the 2qz luminosity function , where the power - law index changes from @xmath111 to @xmath112 . as shown in figure  [ fig : lf ] ,",
    "the @xmath108 luminosity functions of this work and the 2qz are similar for quasars within our luminosity range .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfz ] plots the measured evolution of the quasar space density from our @xmath12 quasar sample and the optically selected 2qz and sdss samples .",
    "the three surveys indicate a peak in quasar activity occurs at @xmath11 .    if the dust obscuration of agns is a function of bolometric luminosity ( e.g. , hao et  al . 2005 ) , then the shape of the quasar luminosity function should vary with color .",
    "for example , if obscuration increases with decreasing luminosity , then the luminosity function of reddened quasars should be steeper than that of blue quasars .",
    "we divided our sample into quasars with @xmath63 $ ] colors that are redder and bluer than the higher mir flux quasar template of ( 2005 ) .",
    "this rest - frame color cut of @xmath63=4.4 $ ] corresponds to an apparent color cut of @xmath63\\sim3.8 $ ] over the redshift range @xmath113 .",
    "as the spectroscopic subsamples contain @xmath114 quasars each , the uncertainties for @xmath97 are prohibitively large if we let evolution parameters ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ) float .",
    "we have therefore fixed the values of the evolution parameters to the fit derived with the entire quasar sample .",
    "our best fit luminosity function parameters are given in table  [ table : quasarlf ] .",
    "the power - law indices ( @xmath97 ) of the blue and red subsamples differ by only @xmath115 .",
    "this is not completely unexpected as the range of dust obscuration probed by our samples is limited .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : colr ] , at @xmath108 our @xmath48 spectroscopic sample spans a range of @xmath116 values of @xmath117 .",
    "in contrast , the range of @xmath116 values spanned by seyfert is and iis is @xmath118 ( e.g. , clavel et  al .",
    "2000 ) . at present",
    ", the dependence of the dust obscuration on bolometric luminosity has only been seen in comparisons of type i and ii agns ( hao et  al . 2005 ) , so a complete sample of type ii quasars may be required to understand the relationship between dust obscuration and luminosity for the most bolometrically luminous quasars .",
    "ideally we would measure the luminosity functions of both type i and ii quasars . however , spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath33 type ii quasars are non - trivial as their optical counterparts can be extremely faint ( e.g. , houck et  al . 2005 ; martnez - sansigre et  al .",
    "photometric redshifts are also difficult as the broad - band sed includes unknown contributions from the agn , host galaxy , and dust ( zakamska et  al . 2005 ) . in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief discussion of the type ii quasar candidates .",
    "a spectroscopic campaign to measure the redshifts of the most luminous type ii quasar candidates is ongoing , and a future paper will discuss the luminosity function of these objects in detail .",
    "we designate all @xmath12 sources brighter than @xmath53 with extended @xmath58 optical counterparts ( or counterparts too faint for reliable morphological classification ) as @xmath33 type ii quasar candidates . at @xmath119",
    ", @xmath79 corresponds to a blue @xmath120 galaxy ( wolf et  al .",
    "unlike radio and x - ray surveys , we can detect @xmath33 type ii quasars which are both radio - quiet and compton thick .",
    "the main contaminants of the sample will be starburst galaxies , @xmath32 type ii agns , and reddened type i quasars .",
    "there are 376 @xmath33 type ii quasar candidates in our survey area .",
    "only 20 of these objects have spectroscopic redshifts , mostly from ( 2005 ) , and all but one of these redshifts are in the range @xmath121 .",
    "the optical colors of the type ii quasars candidates are shown in figure  [ fig : col_type2 ] .",
    "the locus of blue @xmath122 and red @xmath123 colors are consistent with @xmath124 host galaxies .",
    "type ii candidates with counterparts in the radio catalog of ( 2002 ) and the xbotes  chandra imaging survey ( murray et  al . 2005 ) are also shown in figure  [ fig : col_type2 ] .",
    "as the @xmath125 to @xmath126 background of the xbotes  survey is only @xmath127 counts within a @xmath128 radius aperture , the detection of a single x - ray photon within this aperture is significant in the vast majority of cases , and at @xmath129 a single photon in xbotes   corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath130 . for a @xmath33 source this is a strong indicator of agn activity , as the implied luminosity is an order of magnitude more than low redshift starbursts including arp 220 , which has an observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath131 ( mcdowell et  al .",
    "one - third of the type ii quasar candidates have one or more x - ray photons in the chandra images , and this increases to 45% for candidates brighter than @xmath132 .",
    "we have determined upper limits for the fraction of @xmath33 obscured quasars as a function of flux by dividing the number of @xmath33 type ii candidates by the total number of @xmath33 type i and type ii candidates .",
    "contamination of our @xmath33 type i sample is low and contamination of the @xmath33 type ii candidate sample by @xmath32 agns and starbursts could be high , so this fraction is an upper limit .",
    "upper limits for the fraction of obscured quasars as a function of @xmath133 flux are plotted figure  [ fig : frac ] .",
    "this should not be confused with the fraction of obscured quasars as a function of bolometric luminosity , which would require accurate redshift information .",
    "we do not know if the obscured quasars have systematically lower redshifts ( and bolometric luminosities ) than the type i quasars with comparable @xmath133 fluxes .",
    "we also do not know the extent of dust absorption of rest - frame @xmath134 emission in these agns . despite these caveats ,",
    "it is reasonable to conclude that the ratio of obscured and unobscured agns near the break in optical luminosity function ( roughly @xmath135 ) is of order unity .",
    "this is consistent with studies of x - ray selected agns , optically selected seyferts , and small samples of infrared selected @xmath33 type ii quasars ( e.g. , steffen et  al .",
    "2003 ; ueda et  al . 2003 ; hao et  al . 2005 ; martnez - sansigre et  al .",
    "the fraction of obscured quasars decreases with increasing flux , which is similar to the trend observed as a function of luminosity in x - ray and optical samples ( e.g. , ueda et  al . 2003 ; hao et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "if the obscured fraction is decreasing rapidly with increasing luminosity , the type i quasar luminosity function approximates the luminosity function of all quasars at the highest luminosities .",
    "however , to confirm this will require complete spectroscopic samples of type ii quasars .",
    "we have measured the @xmath8 luminosity function of type i quasars as a function of redshift using 292 quasars and quasar candidates selected from _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xmath12 imaging of the ndwfs botes   field .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for 270 of these quasars were measured as part of the ages survey of botes .",
    "we were able to detect reddened type i quasars which were missed by uvx quasar surveys , and these comprise approximately a fifth of the type i quasar population .",
    "the type i quasar luminosity function at @xmath8 , and its evolution with redshift , is very similar to quasar luminosity functions at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfz ] illustrates the evolution of the space density of type i quasars .",
    "there is qualitative agreement between our best - fit luminosity function and the 2qz and sdss , despite our sample being selected at @xmath12 rather than the optical .",
    "we directly detect the peak in quasar activity at @xmath10 , which has been difficult to directly measure with optical quasar surveys because it corresponds to the redshift range where quasar optical colors are similar to those of stars .",
    "our best - fit model indicates that the quasar space density declines by a factor of @xmath136 between @xmath137 and @xmath138 , though this decline has low significance .",
    "if we fit our data with a model where the space density is constant after @xmath139 then our luminosity function parameters change by @xmath140 .",
    "however , such a model disagrees with the results of optical surveys of @xmath141 quasars ( schmidt , schneider , & gunn 1995 ; fan et  al .",
    "2004 ) . thus , unless the obscured quasar fraction increases at high redshift , our study and previous optical quasar surveys indicate that the quasar space density declines at @xmath141 .",
    "while the evolution of the type i quasar space density has been measured over a broad range of wavelengths , the evolution of type ii quasars remains uncertain .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac ] indicates that they could comprise 70% of @xmath33 quasars",
    "brighter than @xmath53 , though this fraction decreases with increasing flux and luminosity .",
    "until there is a systematic campaign to measure the spectroscopic redshifts of type ii quasars , the @xmath8 luminosity function of all quasars will remain uncertain .",
