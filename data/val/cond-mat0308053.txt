    "strongly correlated electron systems display remarkably interesting and puzzling phenomena , such as high  temperature superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance , heavy fermion behavior , huge volume expansions and collapses to name a few .",
    "these properties need to be explored with modern theoretical methods .",
    "unfortunately , the strongly correlated systems are complex materials with electrons occupying active 3d , 4f or 5f orbitals , ( and sometimes p orbitals as in many organic compounds and in bucky",
    " balls  based systems ) . here , the excitational spectra over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies can not be described in terms of well  defined quasiparticles .",
    "therefore , the design of computational methods and algorithms for quantitative description of strongly correlated materials is a great intellectual challenge , and an enormous amount of work has addressed this problem in the past reviewdft , reviewgw , reviewflex , reviewqmc , reviewexactdiag , reviewdmrg , reviewlda+u , reviewsic , reviewtddft , reviewdmft , reviewlda+dmft , reviewtsvelik .    at the heart of the strong  correlation problem",
    "is the competition between localization and delocalization , i.e. between the kinetic energy and the electron  electron interactions .",
    "when the overlap of the electron orbitals among themselves is large , a wave  like description of the electron is natural and sufficient .",
    "liquid theory explains why in a wide range of energies systems , such as alkali and noble metals , behave as weakly interacting fermions , i.e. they have a fermi surface , linear specific heat and a constant magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the one  electron spectra form quasi  particles and quasi  hole bands and the one  electron spectral functions show delta  functions like peaks corresponding to the one  electron excitations .",
    "we have powerful quantitative techniques such as the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density and generalized gradient approximation ( lda and gga ) , for computing ground state properties @xcite .",
    "these techniques can be successfully used as starting points for perturbative computation of one  electron spectra , for example using the gw method @xcite .",
    "they have also been successfully used to compute the strength of the electron  phonon coupling and the resistivity of simple metals @xcite .",
    "when the electrons are very far apart , a real  space description becomes valid .",
    "a solid is viewed as a regular array of atoms where each element binds an integer number of electrons .",
    "these atoms carry spin and orbital quantum numbers giving rise to a natural spin and orbital degeneracy .",
    "transport occurs with the creation of vacancies and doubly occupied sites .",
    "atomic physics calculations together with perturbation theory around the atomic limit allow us to derive accurate spin  orbital hamiltonians .",
    "the one  electron spectrum of the mott insulators is composed of atomic excitations which are broaden to form bands that have no single  particle character .",
    "the one  electron green functions show at least two pole  like features known as the hubbard bands @xcite , and the wave functions have an atomic  like character , and hence require a many  body description .",
    "the scientific frontier one would like to explore is a category of materials which falls in between the atomic and band limits .",
    "these systems require both a real space and a momentum space description . to treat these systems",
    "one needs a many  body technique which is able to treat kohn ",
    "sham bands and hubbard bands on the same footing , and which is able to interpolate between well separated and well overlapping atomic orbitals .",
    "the solutions of many ",
    "body equations have to be carried out on the level of the green functions which contain necessary information about the total energy and the spectrum of the solid .",
    "the development of such techniques has a long history in condensed matter physics .",
    "studies of strongly correlated systems have traditionally focused on model hamiltonians using techniques such as diagrammatic methods reviewflex , quantum ",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite , exact diagonalizations for finite  size clusters @xcite , density matrix renormalization group methods@xcite and so on .",
    "model hamiltonians are usually written for a given solid  state system based on physical grounds . in the electronic  structure community ,",
    "the developments of lda+u @xcite and self  interaction corrected ( sic )  reviewsic methods , many  body perturbative approaches based on gw and its extensions @xcite , as well as time ",
    "dependent version of the density functional theory @xcite have been carried out .",
    "some of these techniques are already much more complicated and time  consuming comparing to the standard lda based algorithms , and the real exploration of materials is frequently performed by its simplified versions by utilizing such , e.g. , approximations as plasmon  pole form for the dielectric function @xcite , omitting self  consistency within gw @xcite or assuming locality of the gw self  energy@xcite .    in general , diagrammatic methods are most accurate if there is a small parameter in the calculation , say , the ratio of the on  site coulomb interaction @xmath0 to the band width @xmath1 .",
    "this does not permit the exploration of real strongly correlated situations , i.e. when @xmath2 .",
    "systems near mott transition is one of such examples , where strongly renormalized quasiparticles and atomic  like excitations exist simultaneously . in these situations , self  consistent methods based on the dynamical mean ",
    "field based theory ( dmft ) @xcite , and its cluster generalizations such as dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite , or cellular dynamical mean field theory ( c - dmft ) @xcite , are the minimal many body techniques which have to be employed for exploring real materials .",
    "thus , a combination of the dmft based methods with the electronic structure techniques is promising , because a realistic material  specific description where the strength of correlation effects is not known _ a priori _ can be achieved .",
    "this work is in its beginning stages of development but seems to have a success .",
    "the development was started @xcite by introducing so  called lda+dmft method and applying it to the photoemission spectrum of la@xmath3sr@xmath4tio@xmath5 near mott transition , this system shows a number of features incompatible with the one  electron description @xcite .",
    "the lda++ method @xcite has been discussed , and the electronic structure of fe has been shown to be in better agreement with experiment than the one based on lda . the photoemission spectrum near the mott transition in v@xmath6o@xmath7 has been studied @xcite , as well as issues connected to the finite temperature magnetism of fe and ni were explored @xcite .",
    "lda  + dmft  was recently generalized to allow computations of optical properties of strongly correlated materials opticsdmft .",
    "further combinations of the dmft and gw methods have been proposed @xcite and a simplified implementation to ni has been carried out @xcite .",
    "sometimes the lda+dmft  method @xcite omits full self  consistency . in this case",
    "the approach consists in deriving a model hamiltonian with parameters such as the hopping integrals and the coulomb interaction matrix elements extracted from an lda calculation .",
    "binding fits to the lda  energy bands or angular momentum resolved lda densities of states for the electrons which are believed to be correlated are performed .",
    "constrained density functional theory constraineddft is used to find the screened on ",
    "site coulomb @xmath0 and exchange parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this information is used in the downfolded model hamiltonian with only active degrees of freedom to explore the consequences of correlations .",
    "such technique is useful , since it allows us to study real materials already at the present stage of development .",
    "a more ambitious goal is to build a general method which treats all bands and all electrons on the same footing , determines both hoppings and interactions internally using a fully self  consistent procedure , and accesses both energetics and spectra of correlated materials .",
    "several ideas to provide a theoretical underpinning to these efforts have been proposed .",
    "the effective action approach to strongly correlated systems has been used to give realistic dmft  an exact functional formulationchitra1 .",
    "approximations to the exact functional by performing truncations of the baym  kadanoff functional have been discussed @xcite .",
    "simultaneous treatment of the density and the local green function in the functional formulation has been proposed @xcite .",
    "total energy calculations using lda+dmft have recently appeared in the literaturecemcmahan , punature , puscience , nioprl .",

    "fully self  consistent calculations of charge density , excitation spectrum and total energy of the @xmath9 phase of metallic plutonium have been carried out to address the problem of its anomalous volume expansion @xcite .",
    "the extensions of the method to compute phonon spectra of correlated systems with the applications to mott insulators @xcite and high  temperature phases of pu @xcite have been also recently developed .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the details of this unified approach which computes both total energies and spectra of materials with strong correlations and present our applications for pu .",
    "we utilize the effective action free energy approach to strongly correlated systems @xcite and write down the functional of the local green function .",
    "thus , a spectral density functional theory ( sdft ) is obtained .",
    "it can be used to explore strongly correlated materials from _ ab inito _ grounds provided useful approximations exist to the spectral density functional .",
    "one of such approximations is described here , which we refer to as a local dynamical mean field approximation .",

    "since it is the most time  consuming part of all dmft  algorithms , we are carrying out a simplified implementation of it based on a slave boson gtuzwiller gutz , ruck , fleszar and hubbard i @xcite methods .",

    "various aspects of the present work have appeared already reviewtsvelik , punature .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii we describe the spectral density functional theory and discuss local dynamical mean field approximation which summarizes the ideas of cluster and extended @xcite versions of the dmft .",
    "we show that such techniques as lda+dmft reviewlda+dmft , lda+u @xcite , and local gw reviewtsvelik , zein methods are naturally seen within the present method .",
    "section iii describes our implementation of the theory based on the energy  resolved one  particle description @xcite and linear  muffin  tin orbital method @xcite for electronic structure calculation .",
    "section iv discusses application of the method to the volume expansion of pu .",
    "section v is the conclusion .",
    "here we discuss the basic postulates and approximations of spectral density functional theory . the central quantity of our formulation is a `` local '' green function @xmath11 i.e. a part of the exact electronic green function which we are interested to compute .",
    "this is by itself arbitrary since we can probe the green function in a portion of a certain space such , e.g. , as reciprocal space or real space .",
    "these are the most transparent forms where the local green function can be defined .",
    "we can also probe the green function in a portion of the hilbert space .",
    "if a function can be expanded in some basis set @xmath12@xmath13our interest can , e.g , be associated with diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath14 .",
    "as we see , the locality is a basis set dependent property .",
    "nevertheless , it is a very useful property because a most economical description of the function can be achieved .",
    "this is true when the basis set which leads to such description of the function is known .",
    "the choice of the appropriate hilbert space is therefore crucial if we would like to find an optimal description of the system with the accuracy proportional to the computational cost . in spectral density functional theory that has a meaning of finding good approximations to the functional .",
    "therefore we always rely on a physical intuition when choosing a particular representation which should be tailored to a specific physical problem .    at the beginning",
    "we formulate spectral density functional theory in completely real space but keep in mind that such formulation is not unique .",
    "thus , we are interested in finding a part of the electronic green function restricted within a certain cluster area . due to translational invariance of the green function on the original lattice given by primitive translations @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16",
    "it is always sufficient to consider @xmath17 lying within a primitive unit cell @xmath18 positioned at @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath20 travels within some area @xmath21 centered at @xmath22 .",

    "in addition , the effects of electron ",
    "phonon interaction will not be considered .",
    "we will take the effective action functional approach to describe our correlated system @xcite .",
    "the approach allows to obtain the free energy of the solid from a functional @xmath36 evaluated at its stationary point .",
    "the main question is the choice of the variable of the functional which is to be extremized .",
    "this question is highly non  trivial because the exact form of the functional is unknown and the usefulness of the approach , depends on our ability to construct good approximations to it , which in turn depends on the choice of variables .",

    "we have developed the theory assuming that the basis in the hilbert space is indeed the real space which gives us the choice ( [ sdfloc ] ) for the local green function , i.e. the part of the real green function restricted by @xmath253 while this is most natural choice for the purpose of formulating locality in @xmath28 and @xmath20 variables , it is also very useful to discuss a more general choice , connected to some space of orbitals @xmath254 which can be used to represent all the relevant quantities in our calculation . as we have in mind to utilize sophisticated basis sets of modern electronic structure calculations , we will sometimes waive the orthogonality condition and will introduce the overlap matrix @xmath255 especially in cases when we discuss a practical implementation of the method .",

    "if treated exactly @xmath285 $ ] should contain the hartree part . however , we see that the theory delivers k  independent @xmath282 including the hartree term",
    ". there seems to be a paradox since modern electronic structure methods calculate the matrix element of the hartree potential within a given basis exactly , i.e. @xmath286 the k  dependence is trivial here and is connected to the known k  dependence of the basis functions used in the calculation .",
    "therefore , while formulating the spectral density functional theory for electronic structure calculation , we need to keep in mind that in many cases , the k  dependence is factorizable and can be brought into the theory without a problem .",
    "this warns us that the choice of the local green function has to be done with care so that useful approximations to the functional can be worked out .",
    "it also shows that in many cases the k  dependence is encoded into the orbitals .",
    "it is not that non ",
    "trivial k  dependence of the self  energy operator , which is connected to the fact that @xmath287 may be long  range , i.e. decay slowly when @xmath28 departs from @xmath288 .",
    "it may very well be proportional to @xmath289 like the lda potential and still deliver the k  dependence .",
    "it turn out that the desired k dependence with the choice of the green function after ( [ sdflocglc ] ) can be quickly reinstated if we add the density of the system as another variable to the functional .",
    "this is clear since the density is a particular case of the local green function in ( sdfloc ) taken at @xmath290 and summed over @xmath291 therefore combination of definition ( [ sdflocglc ] ) and @xmath102 is another , third possibility of defining @xmath107 this will allow treatment of all local hartree  like potentials without a problem .",
    "moreover , as we discuss below , this may allow to design better approximations to the functional since the hilbert space treatment of locality is more powerful : it may allow us to treat more long  ranged self ",
    "energies than the ones restricted by @xmath292 and the basis sets can be optimally adjusted to specific self ",
    "energies exactly as the basis sets used in electronic structure calculations are tailored to the lda potential .",

    ", sdft provides the  exact energy and exact one  electron density of states which is advantageous compared to the dft which provides the energy and the density only .",

    "is predicted correctly by lda @xcite . since the transport and thermodynamic properties of @xmath509 and @xmath9 pu are very similar ,",
    "the nature of the @xmath265 phase and the reason why lda predicts accurately its structure and volume is by itself is another puzzle .    to address these questions several approaches",
    "have been developed .",
    "the lda+u method was applied to @xmath9 pu @xcite .",
    "it is able to produce the correct volume of the @xmath9 phase for values of the parameter @xmath5104 ev consistent with atomic spectral data and constrained density functional calculations .",
    "similar calculation has been performed by a so  called orbitally ordered density functional method pulda+j . however , both methods predict pu to be magnetic , which is not observed experimentally .",
    "the lda+u method is unable to predict the correct excitation spectrum . also , to recover the @xmath265 phase within lda+u@xmath475the parameter u has to be set to zero which is inconsistent with its transport properties and with microscopic calculations of this parameter .",
    "another approach proposed @xcite in the past is the constrained lda approach in which some of the 5f electrons , are treated as core , while the remaining are allowed to participate in band formation .",
    "results of the self  interaction  corrected lda calculations have been reported @xcite , as well as qualitative discussion of the bonding nature across the actinides series has been given @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem of pu is challenging because its f - electrons are close to the mott transition @xcite .",
    "it provides us a crucial test for our quantitative theory of strong correlations .",
    "a short version of this work has appeared already @xcite .",
    "our implementation is based on the self  consistent lda+dmft method and uses the lmto method in its tight - binding representation @xcite .",
    "orbit coupling effects are important for actinide compounds and have been included in the calculation for pu .",
    "the full potential  terms have been neglected in the calculation through the use of the atomic sphere approximation with a one - kappa lmto basis set .",
    "the necessary @xmath257-space integrals for evaluating green functions and charge densities have been carried out using the tetrahedron method using ( 8,8,8 ) grid in the brillouin zone .",
    "we study in detail the total energy as a function of the parameter @xmath0 and give our predictions for the volumes in @xmath511 @xmath512 and @xmath508 phases . a comparative analysis of the one  electron spectra in both @xmath265 and @xmath9 phases",
    "is also given and the comparison with the photoemission experiment @xcite is made . since the dynamical mean field theory requires the solution of the anderson impurity model for the multi - orbital f ",
    "shell of pu , we have developed a method which , inspired by the success of the iterative perturbation theory @xcite , interpolates the self  energy between small and large frequencies . at low frequencies ,",
    "the exact value of the self - energy and its slope is extracted from the friedel sum rule and from a slave - boson treatmentgutz , ruck , fleszar .",
    "this approach is accurate as it has been shown recently to give the exact critical value of @xmath0 in the large degeneracy limit parcollet  at high frequencies the self - energy behavior can be computed based on high  frequency moments expansions@xcite .",
    "the result of interpolation can be encoded into a simple form for the self  energy like the following continuous fraction expansion@xmath513where the unknown coefficients are determined to satisfy known conditions in the low and high  frequency limits .",
    "this kind of self  energy fits quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) data in large region of parameters , such as @xmath0 and doping , and where this comparison is at all possible ( small degeneracy and high temperature ) .",
    "thus , our approach interpolates between four major limits : small and large i@xmath306 s valid for any @xmath0 as well as small and large @xmath514 ( band vs. atom ) valid for any @xmath87 .",
    "the analytical continuation to the real frequency axis is not a problem with the present method and avoids the use of the pade @xcite and maximum entropy @xcite based techniques .",
    "complete details of the method can be found in ref . .",
    "here we only mention technicalities connected to the f  electrons of pu where we deal with the impurity green functions which are the matrices 14x14 .",
    "however , for the relativistic f - level in cubic symmetry , the matrices can be reduced to 5x5 with 4 non - zero off  diagonal elements .",
    "the solution of such impurity problem is still a formidable numerical problem .",

    "second , since in pu the intermultiplet spin - orbit splitting is much larger than the intramultiplet crystal field splitting ( 5:1 ) , we reduce the problem of solving aim for the levels separately by treating the 5f@xmath515 @xmath516 and @xmath517 levels as one 6-fold degenerate level , and the 5f@xmath518 @xmath519 , @xmath516 and @xmath520 levels as another 8-fold degenerate level .",
    "we perform our calculations for @xmath9 and @xmath521 phases of pu having simple fcc and bcc structures respectively .",

    "<S> we introduce a spectral density functional theory which can be used to compute energetics and spectra of real strongly  correlated materials using methods , algorithms and computer programs of the electronic structure theory of solids . </S>",
    "<S> the approach considers the total free energy of a system as a functional of a local electronic green function which is probed in the region of interest . </S>",
    "<S> since we have a variety of notions of locality in our formulation , our method is manifestly basis  set dependent . </S>",
    "<S> however , it produces the exact total energy and local excitational spectrum provided that the exact functional is extremized . the self  energy of the theory appears as an auxiliary mass operator similar to the introduction of the ground  </S>",
    "<S> state kohn  sham potential in density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is automatically short  ranged in the same region of hilbert space which defines the local green function . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this property to find good approximations to the functional . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if electronic self  energy is known to be local in some portion of hilbert space , a good approximation to the functional is provided by the corresponding local dynamical mean  field theory . </S>",
    "<S> a simplified implementation of the theory is described based on the linear muffin  tin orbital method widely used in electronic strucure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the  power of the approach on the long  standing problem of the anomalous volume expansion of metallic plutonium . </S>"
