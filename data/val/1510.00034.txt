    "these bursts occur more frequently with larger frequency mismatch.,width=345 ]    figure [ 2oscdata](c ) and ( d ) show how this synchronized state is lost . in ( c ) , we are just beyond the frequency cutoff for synchronization . the two dynamic frequencies initially come together and remain close for many cycles , just like in ( b ) .",
    "but then , an abrupt phase slippage occurs ( here around @xmath34 ) , at which time the frequency of the faster oscillator momentarily speeds up while the slower oscillator momentarily slows down . during this time the faster oscillator laps the other , and upon catching up their frequencies again match over multiple cycles before the process repeats itself . in ( d )",
    "the phase breakage occurs more frequently in time .",

    ", we expected that a complicated model would be necessary to capture all of these details . rather than attempt a theoretical derivation of the coupling behavior , we chose instead to find a phenomenological phase oscillator model that explains the system .    to obtain the parameters for our coupling function , we employed an approach similar to that of kralemann et al .",
    "@xcite , which we describe briefly .",
    "measurements of wein - bridge oscillators give their voltage .",
    "the voltage time series @xmath35 must be transformed into a phase time series @xmath36 , called the protophase , by inverting the projection @xmath37 one typically employs the hilbert transform to obtain the protophase of each oscillator @xcite .",
    "if the protophases were taken as the underlying phases , the abrupt phase velocity changes inherent in the behavior of the relaxation oscillators would lead to apparent self - coupling terms .",
    "that is , @xmath38 depends upon @xmath39 .",
    "we wish to transform the protophases such that the phase velocity extracted from the uncoupled oscillator data is constant and does not depend upon phase .",
    "therefore , the next step is to obtain a mapping from protophase @xmath36 to phase @xmath40 .",
    "kralemann suggests obtaining the mapping as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the probability density of the protophase .",
    "we instead obtained the mapping @xmath43 directly from the uncoupled time series by assuming that as @xmath39 proceeds from @xmath44 to @xmath45 at a variable rate , @xmath46 proceeds from @xmath44 to @xmath45 at a constant rate .",
    "this set of data forms the basis of a simple interpolation - based mapping that performed as well as the more sophisticated mapping techniques that we tried .",
    "our next step is to obtain the parameters for a phase oscillator model that adequately describes our results . knowing that the original kuramoto model was insufficient , we started by attempting to fit our data to the sakaguchi - kuramoto model @xcite , which in this case takes the form @xmath47 here @xmath48 represents the uncoupled ( angular ) frequency of oscillator @xmath49 , which we computed from the average frequency of the uncoupled oscillator time series .",

    ", we can now ascertain how well the sakaguchi - kuramoto model performs in matching experimental results . for two oscillators ,",
    "it is fairly straightforward to derive a prediction for the synchronization frequency as a function of mismatch in self - coupled frequency .",
    "one thing to remember is that the self - coupled frequency is governed by the case where @xmath56 , coming out to @xmath57 , whereas the pair - coupled behavior is governed by the case where @xmath58 . using this relationship and employing various trigonometric identities ,",
    "the prediction for the mutually entrained frequency is obtained as @xmath59 when the oscillators do not mutually entrain , it is possible to compute the amount of time for the faster oscillator to lap the slower oscillator , as well as the phase accumulated by each oscillator .",
    "dividing the phase by the time gives the average phase velocity , from which the average unsychronized frequencies can be calculated : @xmath60 the faster oscillator s average frequency is @xmath61 , while the slower oscillator s average frequency is @xmath62 .",
    "this prediction matches the experimental data extremely closely , as shown in fig .",

    "the sakaguchi - kuramoto model accurately predicts the regime over which the two wien - bridge oscillators synchronize .",
    "the bifurcation occurs at the boundary between eqs .",
    "( [ sk_pred_sync ] ) and ( [ sk_pred_unsync ] ) , which is @xmath63 . for our parameters , this condition translates into a predicted maximum self - coupled frequency of @xmath64 , and a minimum frequency of @xmath65 .",

    "[ comp ] for these cutoffs reveals excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "other features , such as the curvature and asymptotic frequencies , are also correctly predicted .",
    "the entrained frequency is predicted to have concave - up curvature .",
    "indeed , just above the the lower - frequency bifurcation point , the mutually entrained frequency _ drops _ with increasing @xmath66 , a counterintuitive feature seen in both the prediction and the data .",

[ 2oscdata ] ) .",
    "good quantitative agreement is found across the whole set of experiments .",
    "( b ) just above the highest phase - locked frequency , rapid phase - slippage events at regular time intervals were observed in the experiment : black squares and red circles with connecting lines represent the measured dynamic frequencies of the faster and slower oscillator , respectively .",
    "the phenomenon is faithfully reproduced in simulations of the sakaguchi - kuramoto model , for which the black solid line and red dashed line represent the faster and slower oscillator , respectively .",
    "( in the graph , the trace obtained by numerical simulation is shifted lower for visual clarity.),width=307 ]    as we have seen , above the maximum phase - locked frequency the two oscillators stay in phase with one another for most of the time , but regular phase - slippage events now occur .",
    "the time separation of these events decreases with larger oscillator frequency difference .",
    "this phenomenon can be reproduced in simulations of the sakaguchi - kuramoto model , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ comp](b ) .",
    "in particular , in both the experimental data and the numerical simulations , we observe the oscillator with the larger self - coupled frequency to break away from the common frequency first , followed in short order by the lower - frequency oscillator .",
    "notice that the simulations also capture the time duration of the phase - slippage events as well as the magnitude of deviation from the common frequency in both directions .",
    "this detailed agreement further demonstrates the direct applicability of the sakaguchi - kuramoto model to this experimental system of electrical oscillators .",
    "the quantitative accuracy of the sakaguchi - kuramoto model is surprising in part because the model is inconsistent with some of the data that we have not presented here .",
    "in particular , the phase time series obtained from the self - coupled data can be used to obtain phase velocity as a function of phase , and these phase velocities clearly show a phase dependence .",
    "theorists and modelers often assume that the coupling function can be written as @xmath69 ; miyazaki and kinoshita present a concise explanation for why this should be @xcite .",
    "however , any such model ( the sakaguchi - kuramoto model being among them ) would predict that the self - coupled speeds are related to the uncoupled speeds by a constant offset .",
    "they are unable to explain any phase dependence .",
    "fortunately , it appears that these discrepancies are only minor matters .",
    "our wien - bridge oscillators were specified to operate in a regime that is characterized by a relaxation oscillator .",
    "the dynamics of the protophases seem complicated and aspects of the coupled behavior seemed counter - intuitive . in spite of these complexities , the underlying phase dynamics are surprisingly simple , and can be characterized by the simple and well - studied sakaguchi - kuramoto model .",
    "next , we turn our attention to collective behavior that arises simply by altering the coupling topology of an ensemble of such oscillators .",
    "the asymmetries found in the pairwise data have implications for the coupled behavior of larger collections of oscillators . to explore these implications",
    ", we prepared a set of 19 oscillators , initially coupled together in an all - to - all network .",
    "the self - coupled frequencies of the ensemble were roughly evenly spaced over a frequency range of @xmath70 . in this section",
    "we explore the asymmetries , which become even more striking when we consider an all - to - some network .",
    "we begin by systematically examining the fully coupled configuration over a range of coupling values .",
    "figure [ ps](a ) reports the average dynamic frequency of all oscillators for three different values of coupling for this configuration .",
    "series a is for the strongest coupling at @xmath28 while series c is for the weakest coupling at @xmath71 .",
    "full synchronization could be achieved with a narrower frequency range @xmath72 , a stronger coupling , or ( as we will show ) an altered coupling topology .",
    "we chose this combination to highlight an asymmetry in the synchronization that arises for positive @xmath53 : as coupling decreases , the slowest oscillators remain intact while the faster oscillators fall out of synchronization .    due to this observed asymmetry",
    ", we hypothesized that we could increase the degree of synchrony by silencing the slowest oscillators . by opening the @xmath21 for some of the slowest oscillators , the equation describing the dynamics changes in a simple but important way .",
    "the original sakaguchi - kuramoto model includes a self - coupling term , made evident by pulling it out of the all - to - all sum : @xmath73 opening @xmath21 effectively removes this self - coupling term for the oscillator ; from the standpoint of the oscillator just removed , we have essentially increased its natural frequency by an amount @xmath74 . from the standpoint of the other oscillators ,",
    "the coupling has gotten stronger , going from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , and the width of the population has gotten narrower because the lower end of the flat spectrum has risen . also , the self - coupled frequencies of the oscillators at the higher end should be lower ( due to higher self - coupling ) and the average velocity of the cluster should be closer to the high end of the spectrum . assuming that the oscillators are indexed in order of increasing frequency and we have silenced the first @xmath77 of them , we have @xmath78 thus the oscillators that are still `` talking '' should be more tightly bound than they would have been with the other oscillator present , while the just - removed oscillator will have a higher natural frequency and be interacting with a stronger cluster . silencing the slowest oscillators should increase synchrony .",
    "figure [ ps](b ) reports a systematic test of this hypothesis .",
    "there are n=19 oscillators altogether , and the horizontal axis records how many of them are talking , i.e. @xmath79 ( again , all are listening ) .",

    "if not , we used an iterative approach to identify the minimum coupling strength at which all oscillators synchronized .",
