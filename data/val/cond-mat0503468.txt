    "the contact of nematic liquid crystals ( nlcs ) with structured solid substrates offers the possibility to manipulate the orientation of the adjacent liquid crystal molecules in a controlled way .",
    "for example , substrates with topographic structures influence anchoring of liquid crystal molecules and induce elastic distortions and flexoelectric polarizations within a contacting nlc .",
    "alignment of liquid crystal molecules can also be governed by the pattern of boundary lines between different regions on a flat substrate and the nlc elasticity .",
    "adjacent regions of planar and homeotropic anchoring within a single substrate have been created , for example , by micro - contact printed polar and apolar thiols , respectively , on an obliquely evaporated ultra - thin gold layer . whereas many experimental and theoretical studies have focussed on the understanding of the interactions and phase behavior of nlcs in contact with _",

    "while such a device is characterized by both a high shock stability and a low power consumption , the deep grating structure leads to a reduction of the contrast of the display @xcite .",
    "on the basis of our calculations we expect that an additional chemical surface pattern allows one to use rather a shallow grating surface instead of a deep one .",
