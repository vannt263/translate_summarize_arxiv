    "analysis of geophysical flows often employs techniques that decompose the velocity field in a manner that will yield a desired insight @xcite .",
    "a commonly used technique is the mean - eddy decomposition    [ eq : dyn ] @xmath0    where the field is described by the unsteady eddy activity around a mean state ; henceforth , @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the time average ( mean ) and the residual ( unsteadiness or eddy ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath3 is the velocity field and @xmath4 represents any property of the flow such as temperature , chemical or biological properties . in the absence of unsteadiness , the kinematic transport occurs only along the mean streamlines on which @xmath5 is everywhere tangent .",
    "an effect of the unsteadiness is to stir the flow instantaneously and induce mixing across the mean streamlines over time .",
    "it is also well accepted that instantaneous pictures of the unsteady flow themselves do not indicate transport explicitly .",
    "a variety of eulerian and lagrangian methods have been developed to study transport observationally , analytically , and numerically .",
    "the companion paper @xcite presented a new transport method that is a hybrid combination of lagrangian and eulerian methods .",
    "this paper develops a framework for the analysis and diagnosis of transport processes based on this new method .",
    "our main focus is on two - dimensional geophysical flows that may be compressible . to introduce our method , we begin with a brief discussion of lagrangian and eulerian methods specific to our needs .",
    "the basis of any lagrangian method involves the tracking of individual fluid particles by solving the initial value problem of @xmath6 .",
    "starting from @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , a particle trajectory @xmath9 at time @xmath10 is given by the temporal integral of the local velocity field along itself :    @xmath11    a very rudimentary description of lagrangian transport may be obtained from a so - called `` spaghetti diagram '' which is constructed by simply plotting the trajectories .",
    "typically this results in a complex tangle of curves from which detailed a detailed assessment of lagrangian transport may prove difficult . in recent years the mathematical theory of dynamical systems has provided a new point of view and tools for classifying , organizing , and analyzing detailed and complex trajectory information by providing a theoretical and computational framework for an understanding of the geometric properties of `` flow structures '' .",
    "recent reviews of the dynamical systems approach to transport are given in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there still remain many challenging problems to be tackled by lagrangian methods .",
    "quantifying lagrangian transport is extremely elaborate in general .",
    "while techniques based on dynamical systems theory are conceptually ideal for tracking transport of fluid particles , they have not proven as useful for studying transport of @xmath4 , unless @xmath4 is uniform and passive . moreover , lagrangian methods are not suitable for separating and/or isolating the roles played by the mean state @xmath5 and the unsteadiness @xmath12 in the trajectory @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to lagrangian methods , transport quantities computed with eulerian methods utilize information taken at pre - selected stationary points . at a station @xmath13",
    ", the most basic eulerian transport may be given by the temporal integral of the local velocity during a time interval @xmath14 $ ] : @xmath15 the resulting transport is associated with @xmath5 , but not @xmath12 by default [ compare with ( [ eq : xl ] ) for the lagrangian case ] .",
    "for transport across a stationary eulerian curve @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parameter along @xmath18 , the total transport during @xmath14 $ ] over a spatial segment @xmath19 $ ] is @xmath20 an advantage of the eulerian methods is the ability to compute the transport of @xmath4 as well , by replacing @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "overtime , the eulerian methods gives @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the eulerian methods account for the statistical contribution to transport at the second - order .",
    "our new transport method @xcite has the unique ability to identify the effects of the mean - eddy interaction in a way that neither lagrangian nor eulerian methods have accomplished .",
    "this advantage that comes from blending of the lagrangian and eulerian approaches .",
    "the method uses information on a stationary ( eulerian ) boundary curve @xmath24 to estimate ( lagrangian ) transport of both fluid particles and @xmath4 across @xmath24 without requiring tracking of individual fluid particles .",
    "the method estimates the transport by integrating the instantaneous effects of the unsteady flux while taking the particle advection of the mean flow into account .",
    "we refer to our method that quantifies the * t*ransport * i*nduced by the * m*ean-*e*ddy interaction as `` time . ''    by construction , the time method offers a framework for a detailed analysis of the spatio - temporal structure of transport processes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present this framework through a study of the inter - gyre transport processes in a wind driven , three - layer quasi - geostrophic ocean model ( figure  [ fg : dg_me ] ) . due to its relevance to the mid - latitude ocean circulation",
    ", the dynamics of wind - driven double - gyre ocean models have been actively studied from various points of view over the last few decades ( for review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the details of transport are highly dependent on the dynamics of the flows , there are five common preparatory steps for the analysis using the time method . the initial two steps of the five concern obtaining an understanding of the flow dynamics based on the mean - eddy decomposition ( [ eq : dyn ] ) .",
    "the first step is to examine the global flow structure given by the mean flow @xmath5 , which we call the _ reference state _",
    "( figure  [ fg : dg_me]a for the wind - driven ocean ; see section  [ sec : bsc_mean ] for the details ) .",
    "the second step is to understand the nature of the unsteady eddy activity in @xmath12 .",
    "unsteady eddy activity is also referred to as the _ variability_. in geophysical flows , variability is often associated with the temporal evolution of the spatially coherent structures ( figure  [ fg : dg_me]b ; see section  [ sec : bsc_dyn ] for the details ) .",
    "it should be clear that these coherent structures are defined in the instantaneous eulerian field and different from the so - called `` lagrangian coherent structures '' @xcite .    with understanding and insights of the mean and the variability at hand ,",
    "the third step is to compute the the instantaneous flux that stirs the flow .",
    "the instantaneous flux is expressed naturally in terms of a ",
    "mean - eddy interaction  .",
    "( figure  [ fg : dg_me]c for the wind - driven ocean ; see section  [ sec : bsc_flx ] ) .",
    "the fourth step is to select the _ eulerian boundary _ , @xmath24 , of interest based on the mean flow structure .",
    "any mean streamline with reasonable length can be a potential @xmath24 .",
    "the actual choice of @xmath24 should be left up to the specific geophysical interests . in figure",
    "[ fg : dg_me]a we show our choice of @xmath24 for the intergyre transport in the wind - driven ocean ; which we discuss further in section  [ sec : bsc_c ] ) .",
    "the last step is to extract the information of the instantaneous flux on @xmath24 .",
    "the signals of the variability in the mean - eddy interaction are conveniently represented by a space - time diagram ( i.e. , _ the hovmller diagram _ ) , which we call the _ flux diagram _ to emphasize its role in the time method ( see section  [ sec : bsc_mu ] ) .",
    "an important outcome of the five preparatory steps is that they link the flow dynamics to the transport processes , and _",
    "vice versa _ , in terms of the mean - eddy interaction .",
    "this link , and the spatio - temporal integration employed by the time method , comprise the foundation for the graphical approach to the study of the transport processes ( see section  [ sec : fnc ] ) . in the double - gyre application",
    ", the analysis will reveal how / when / where the circulating eddy vortices in a localized area over the eastward jet are responsible for the inter - gyre transport , whereas the basin - scale rossby waves play a very small role ( see section  [ sec : dg ] ) .",
    "we use the same flow field as in @xcite that is nearly periodic in time and has a heteroclinic connection in the mean .",
    "it is worth noting that the time method does not require either of such conditions ( i.e. , presence of the time periodicity and the heteroclinic connection ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : bsc ] presents the preparatory steps using the application to the inter - gyre transport in the double - gyre wind - driven ocean circulation .",
    "we extend the time functions defined by @xcite and present a graphical approach that facilitates the analysis of transport processes in section  [ sec : fnc ] .",
    "inter - gyre transport processes in the double - gyre ocean are analyzed in section  [ sec : dg ] .",
    "section  [ sec : cncl ] summarizes the results and provides a discussion .",
    "in this section we define the five preparatory steps mentioned in the previous section in detail and carry them out in the context of the analysis of inter - gyre transport in a wind driven double - gyre ocean circulation model .",
    "the flow field is obtained by numerical simulation of a three - layer quasi - geostrophic model with the model parameters chosen to be consistent with the mid - latitude , wind - driven ocean circulations @xcite . as a result of a constant wind - stress curl @xmath25dyn/@xmath26 applied at the ocean surface",
    ", the basin - scale circulation fluctuates almost periodically around the mean state with dominant spectral peak at period @xmath27days after the initial 30,000-day spin - up from the rest . for our analysis time starts after this spin - up . in this study",
    ", we analyze the inter - gyre transport processes in the top layer .",
    "the instantaneous flow patterns are given by the streamfunction @xmath28 that is related to the velocity @xmath21 by @xmath29 .",
    "given @xmath5 , the corresponding streamfunction @xmath30 is the reference state that provides a geometrical structure of the global flow .",
    "figure  [ fg : dg_me]a shows @xmath31 for the double - gyre circulation in which the axis of the eastward jet divides the ocean basin into two gyres .",
    "because the ocean model has gone through the pitchfork bifurcation prior to the hopf bifurcation @xcite ( in terms of increasing wind - stress curl ) , an asymmetry exists between the cyclonic subpolar gyre and the anticyclonic subtropical gyre . at the confluence of the southward and northward western boundary currents , the cyclonic subpolar gyre and anti - cyclonic subtropical gyre form an asymmetric dipole ( along @xmath32 and @xmath33 indicated by the diamonds in figure  [ fg : dg_me]a ) .",
    "we refer to this region as the `` dipole region . ''",
    "the eastward jet defined between the center of the subpolar vortex and that of the subtropical gyre and carries the mean net transport @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the minimum @xmath30 over the subpolar vortex and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the maximum over the subtropical vortex .",
    "the asymmetry of the two gyres is measured by the transport difference , @xcite @xmath39 .",
    "an understanding of the eddy activity ( variability ) in @xmath12 is the key for the analysis of transport processes using the time method . in the double - gyre application ,",
    "the model ocean dynamics is almost periodic in time resulting from the rossby - wave mode @xcite . in the left panel of figure  [ fg : dg_must_u ] ,",
    "the evolution of the ocean dynamics is shown by two time series .",
    "the net transport of the jet @xmath40 indicates the fluctuation of the jet strength around the mean .",
    "the transport difference @xmath41 normalized by @xmath42 measures the fluctuation of the asymmetry between the subpolar and subtropical gyres around the mean . here",
    "@xmath43 is the minimum @xmath28 over the subpolar gyre and @xmath44 is the maximum over the subtropical gyre .",
    "the two time series show that the amplitude of the fluctuation is of the order smaller than 0.1 with respect to the mean .",
    "this fact is important since the validity of the time functions requires the fluctuations to be small compared to the mean .    for convenience ,",
    "we define the period of the @xmath45-th ocean oscillation by @xmath46}=[t^{*}_{38}+(k-1)t , t^{*}_{38}+kt)$ ] starting from @xmath47 when a minimum of @xmath48 occurs first time after the spin - up ; the number in the subscript of @xmath49 represents time in day from here on .",

    "the eddy streamfunction field @xmath55 associated with @xmath12 provides an instantaneous pattern of the eddy activity . in the double - gyre application",
    ", @xmath55 shows two types of eddy activity ( figure  [ fg : dg_me]b ) .",
    "one is the westward propagation of rossby waves , whose latitudinally elongated structures are especially visible in the eastern basin .",
    "typically there are three waves in the entire basin , although the one in the western basin is distorted around the dipole region .",
    "the travel time of the wave from the eastern to the western boundary is 453(=151@xmath563)days .",
    "each wave has the longitudinal width 333(=1000/3)km and travels with the propagation phase speed 2.2(=1000/453)km / day .",
    "as mentioned briefly in the introduction , for our study of inter - gyre transport in the wind - driven ocean , the axis of the eastward jet is chosen to be @xmath24 .",
    "it is the separatrix that connects the western boundary to the eastern boundary .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section [ sec : bsc_c ] .",
    "although the westward propagation of rossby waves is seen in almost the entire ocean basin , the dipole region has the eddy activity that is more energetic .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fg : dg_ph4_psie_phi ] show the phases of these eddy vortices during @xmath57}$ ] that starts at @xmath58 . at @xmath59",
    "when @xmath52 is minimum ( corresponding to figure  [ fg : dg_me]b ) , a strongly positive eddy vortex is located near @xmath60 .",
    "this eddy vortex weakens as the center moves from @xmath60 along @xmath24 as shown at @xmath61 when @xmath48 is maximum .",

    "it continues to make a cyclic rotation around the sub - polar vortex .",
    "one cyclic rotation takes @xmath69 .",
    "the negative eddy vortex located in the west of this positive eddy vortex at @xmath70 follows the same cyclic motion but @xmath71 behind with the opposite phase of @xmath48 and @xmath52 with respect to the positive eddy vortex .",
    "this cyclic rotation of the eddy vortices is far from uniform because the eddy vortices tend to pulsate , i.e. , when they intensify during @xmath50}$ ] or @xmath51}$ ] ( e.g. , @xmath70 or @xmath72 in figure  [ fg : dg_ph4_psie_phi ] ) , the centers hardly move ; when they weaken at the end of @xmath50}$ ] or @xmath51}$ ] ( e.g. , @xmath58 or @xmath73 ) , the centers move very quickly .",
    "as we shall see below , this complexity in the flow dynamics strongly influences the inter - gyre transport processes .",
    "we emphasize that these eddy vortices are not lagrangian , i.e. , particles do nt move with them .",
    "these two types of eddy activity , westward propagation of the rossby wave and cyclonic circulation of the eddy vortices , are synchronized .",
    "in particular they merge in the eastern part of the dipole region . at @xmath70 ,",
    "a negative eddy vortex connects to a negative half of the rossby wave around @xmath74 as shown in figures  [ fg : dg_me ] and  [ fg : dg_ph4_psie_phi ] .",
    "this merger occurs every @xmath71 and is associated with the alternating sign of @xmath55 .      the instantaneous flux across the mean flow    @xmath76    is explicitly defined in terms of the `` mean - eddy interaction '' induced by the instantaneous spatial interaction of @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",

    "the amplitude of @xmath75 depends not only @xmath77 and @xmath78 , but also on the angle between @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "we refer to the coherent structures associated with @xmath75 as the _ flux zones_.    in the double - gyre application , the two types of eddy activity in @xmath12 lead to distinct evolution of flux zones in @xmath75 . in the eastern basin where the rossby waves dominate the variability , the direction change of @xmath5 in both gyres breaks the wave structure latitudinally into three flux zones with alternating signs ( figure  [ fg : dg_me]c ) . near the jet axis ,",
    "a sequence of the rossby waves lead to a sequence of flux zones with alternating signs ; the positive flux zones correspond to northward flux , while the negative ones correspond to the southward flux .",

    ", the piece - wise independence property implies that the accumulation function can be written as    @xmath155    for example , in the double - gyre application , the effect of the circulating eddy vortices and that of the rossby wave propagation can be examined separately , while the overall transport is the sum of the two , i.e. , @xmath156 .",

    "a key feature of the time method is the _ graphical approach _ using the hovmller diagram of @xmath111 . by definition ( [ eq : mac ] ) , transport processes are described by the manner in which the reference trajectory passes through the signals in @xmath111 over the specific domain of interest @xmath138 ( see figure[fg : dg_must_u ] ) .",
