    "the interplay of multiple scattering and amplification can lead to interesting and still poorly understood phenomena , culminating in `` random lasing '' @xcite .",
    "the random laser is a strongly scattering disordered medium where losses due to leakage of light through open boundaries are compensated by amplification inside the medium ( sustained due to some external pump mechanism ) , so that lasing condition is fulfilled despite the absence of an external cavity @xcite .",
    "similar to conventional lasers ( i.e. lasers composed of a transparent amplifying medium inside a high - q cavity ) @xcite , random lasers start laser emission only when the pump power reaches a threshold . below the threshold ,",
    "the system represents a `` random laser amplifier '' : it amplifies light propagating inside it ( though the amplification is not strong enough to compensate for losses ) and it is expected to exhibit properties similar to that of conventional laser amplifiers @xcite : increased noise in transmission , amplified spontaneous emission , etc .",
    "random laser amplifiers are promising systems for studies of anderson localization of light @xcite and , more generally , any interference effects in disordered media because , on the one hand , the amplification gives increased weight to long - lived quasi - modes ( or , equivalently , to long wave paths inside the medium ) and , on the other hand , the system remains linear , in contrast to `` true '' random lasers , operating above threshold in strongly nonlinear regimes .",
    "however , precisely because they operate below laser threshold , laser amplifiers require full quantum treatment that properly accounts for spontaneous emission processes @xcite",
    ". one of the quantities for which such a treatment is crucial is the photocount probability distribution @xmath1 , giving the probability density of counting @xmath2 photons at the output of the amplifier during a given sampling time @xmath3 . in the classical picture , @xmath1 would be akin to that in a medium without amplification , with a larger average value of @xmath2 , but with exactly the same values of normalized higher statistical moments . in the quantum picture , which corresponds to the physical reality observed in experiments ,",
    "laser amplifiers are known to add noise to the incident light and to generate a noisy light field ( amplified spontaneous emission , ase ) even in the absence of an external signal @xcite . for random laser amplifiers with time - independent properties ( quenched disorder )",
    "@xmath1 was studied by beenakker and patra in a series of papers @xcite using the methods of random - matrix theory .",
    "more recently , florescu and john have considered photon statistics of light emitted by random lasers @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the first two statistical moments of @xmath1 for light transmitted through or emitted by random laser amplifiers with _ fluctuating _ properties .",
    "a simple example of such a system is a suspension of scattering centers ( particles ) in brownian motion , with amplification either in the background medium ( typically , a laser dye ) or in the particles themselves . such media are often used in experiments on random lasers @xcite . because of the slow motion of scattering centers , all possible configurations of disorder",
    "are explored continuosly , leading to continuous changes of transmission and reflection coefficients of the medium . as a consequence ,",
    "two simple limits exist .",
    "first , for short sampling times @xmath3 , well below the correlation time @xmath4 of , say , transmission coefficients ( if the measurement is performed in transmission ) , the measurement yields the same result as if the scattering centers were immobile ( quenched disorder ) . in the opposite limit of very long sampling times @xmath3 ,",
    "much in excess of @xmath4 , configurational average is effectively performed due to the scatterer motion and the measurement directly yields the ensemble average of the measured quantity ( annealed disorder ) .",
    "however , only in these two limits a direct link between the results obtained for stationary and fluctuating media can be established . in the general case of arbitrary @xmath3 and , in particular ,",
    "when @xmath5 , the result will depend on the particular type of scatterer dynamics and can not be predicted from _ a priori _ considerations .",
    "it is precisely this general situation that we consider in the present paper .",
    "our analysis is rather general and applies to any random laser amplifier with fluctuating properties . to be more specific ,",
    "we illustrate our main results on the particularly important example of a liquid suspension of scattering particles in brownian motion , where amplification can take place either in the particles , in the liquid , or in both .",
    "a slab - shaped sample of thickness @xmath6 is filled with an amplifying disordered medium represented by discrete , mobile scattering centers ( circles ) with amplification of light either in the scatterers , in the surrounding medium , or in both .",
    "a spatially uniform amplification is achieved through an external pump mechanism .",
    "the slab is illuminated by a probe light in the incoming mode @xmath7 ; all other incoming modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( dashed arrows ) are in vacuum states .",
    "we are interested in the fluctuations of transmitted light in the mode @xmath10 . the polygonal dashed path inside the slab illustrates multiple scattering of light with a mean free path @xmath11 .",

    "we consider a slab of amplifying disordered medium with time - dependent properties ( see fig .",

    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 is the speed of light in the free space . in counting the number of transverse modes we have taken into account 2 propagation directions ( from left to right and from right to left ) and 2 polarization states of the electromagnetic field . in our notation @xmath19",

    "it can be in arbitrary quantum state .",
    "all other incoming modes are assumed to be in vacuum states",

    "the physical meaning of this can be understood on the simple example of a suspension of scattering particles . because of the thermal motion of particles , scattered light will suffer from doppler broadening and hence will not be monochromatic even if the incident light were .",
    "the doppler broadening of transmitted , reflected , and spontaneously emitted light are described by the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "let us now show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : generaliorelation ] ) indeed describes a medium with time - dependent properties . to this end",
    "we consider a realistic situation of a measurement device sensitive only to light within a narrow frequency band @xmath49 around the frequency @xmath50 of the incident wave .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath51 can be due either to some technical limitations of the device or to a band - pass filter put in front of it on purpose .",
    "taking spectral filtering into account , the result of any measurement performed on the outgoing mode @xmath10 can be expressed through an inverse windowed fourier transform @xmath52 of @xmath53 : @xmath54 an expression for @xmath52 can be obtained from eq .",

    "the second condition @xmath103 allows us to neglect variations of the frequency - dependent properties of the medium ( such as the index of refraction , the mean free path , etc . ) within the pass band @xmath51 .",
