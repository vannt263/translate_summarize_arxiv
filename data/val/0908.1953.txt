    "the particle transport in one - dimensional systems is of vital interest for many problems in physics and biology .",
    "a prominent example is the electron or hole transport in the operation of conducting nanowires , including molecular wires.@xcite in such systems transport can be dominated by quantum mechanical tunneling or band motion ( the coherent transport limit ) but many systems belong to the hopping transport limit , where conduction is a manifestation of succession of many incoherent hopping steps.@xcite for example , both conduction mechanisms were observed in different dna sequences.@xcite one - dimensional hopping motion is also the decisive transport mechanism in ion conduction through membrane channels @xcite and unidirectional motion of motor proteins along filaments.@xcite in the connection of the latter example much attention have received recently boundary driven phase transitions in one - dimensional lattice gases with site exclusion and asymmetric hopping dynamics , commonly referred to as `` asymmetric site exclusion process '' ( asep ) , or , in case of unidirectional transport , as `` totally asymmetric site exclusion process '' ( tasep )  for reviews , see refs .  .",
    "recently , properly modified models @xcite were applied to describe the transport of single - stranded dna segments through nanochannels.@xcite    the treatment of one - dimensional systems is moreover frequently used as a starting point for describing transport processes in higher dimensions , since it often allows one to derive analytical results . in transferring essential results to higher dimensions",
    "one has , however , to be careful .",
    "an example is the tracer diffusion in one - dimensional hard - core lattice gases , which exhibits a subdiffusive behavior for long times that originates from the fact that particles can not pass each other in one dimension.@xcite    in this work we will study the thermally activated hopping conduction in one - dimensional lattices for non - interacting particles in arbitrary energy landscapes .",
    "in particular we consider the nonlinear transport in strong static and periodic fields . for couplings @xmath0 of the external bias @xmath1 to the bare hopping rate , this problem was first studied for ring systems ( periodic boundary conditions ) in ref .  .",
    "an exact result for the stationary current was derived , in generalization of an analogous treatment for brownian dynamics.@xcite as a particularly interesting feature , rectification effects were shown to be present for energy landscapes with site energy disorder .",
    "the problem got renewed interest recently for describing measurements on thin glassy electrolytes under high voltages,@xcite which allow one to reach the weak nonlinear regime , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the charge of the mobile ions , @xmath4 is a typical hopping distance of 2 - 3 , @xmath5 is the applied electric field , and @xmath6 the thermal energy . in these experiments",
    "no rectification were observed so far , meaning that the current turned out to be an odd function of the applied field . on the other hand ,",
    "these measurements can be used to determine an effective length scale @xmath7 when analyzing the ratio @xmath8 of the third order nonlinear conductivity @xmath9 to the linear conductivity @xmath10 ( cf.eq .",
    "[ eq : aeff ] below ) .",
    "this length @xmath7 appears to be unphysically large if it is compared to typical jump lengths @xmath11   .",
    "such comparison is motivated by the result @xcite @xmath12 , which applies to the most simple situation of single - particle hopping in an ordered system with the aforementioned coupling @xmath0 of the bias to the bare hopping rates ( see below ) . for different glassy electrolytes @xmath7 either increases or decreases with @xmath13 ( in the temperature ranges studied a linear behavior",
    "was observed ) .",
    "it was also found that @xmath14 , while @xmath15 has different sign for different glass compositions . in the frequency - dependent response",
    "the real part @xmath16 of the third order harmonics @xmath17 has a negative sign for low frequency . with increasing frequency",
    ", @xmath16 increases and becomes positive close to the onset frequency of the dispersive part in the first order harmonics @xmath18 ( which gives the linear response conductivity @xmath19 ) .    taking disorder averages @xcite of the analytical expression for the current derived in ref .",
    ", it was suggested that the large values of @xmath7 have their origin in the spatial variation of hopping rates in the glassy material .",
    "moreover , based on a small @xmath1 expansion , it was predicted that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of sites of the film sample in field direction .",
    "however , this result followed when expanding terms as @xmath22 in the analytical result for the current in power of @xmath23 .",
    "since the nonlinear transport becomes relevant for @xmath24 , and @xmath25 should be significantly larger than one ( to avoid boundary effects ) , this expansion in powers of @xmath23 is in general not appropriate .",
    "rather one should take the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 before carrying out the small @xmath1 expansion of the current,@xcite which can yield non - analyticities in the current response .",
    "it was argued @xcite that these non - analyticities could spoil the analysis of nonlinear conductivities based on odd powers in the field amplitude , as they are commonly employed in experiments .",
    "an open question is whether the rectification effects occurring in finite systems are present also in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that in the absence of long - range correlations in the energy landscape ( i.e.  correlations decaying faster than 1/distance ) , self - averaging effects suppress rectification properties the more the larger the system size becomes . as a consequence one would predict rectification effects to disappear in the thermodynamic limit . while this is in agreement with experimental observations ( for sample thicknesses",
    "so far studied ) , it has not yet been demonstrated by theoretical analysis . to avoid the problem of possible rectification effects and to enforce that the current is an odd function of @xmath1 , energy landscapes with point symmetry were considered in refs .  .",
    "however , the constraint of point symmetry implicitly introduces long - range correlations in the energy landscape and it is questionable if such procedure is suitable to describe real experimental situations .    in this work",
    "we will treat the following open problems :    1.5em    analytical results for the stationary current in ring system with @xmath27 sites were derived up to now for the coupling @xmath28 of the external bias @xmath29 to the bare rates ( rates in the absence of the external driving ) .",
    "this rate emerges naturally when approaching the hopping limit of the overdamped brownian dynamics ( smoluchowski equation ) of noninteracting particles .",
    "however , in interacting many - particle systems more complicated couplings of the rates to the external field can be imagined , when mapping the dynamics to an effective one - particle hopping process in a renormalized energy landscape .",
    "we therefore derive the stationary current for arbitrary couplings , and discuss in more detail the behavior for jump rates obeying the condition of detailed balance .",
    "we find that is then possible to obtain already in an ordered system effective lengths scales @xmath30 significantly larger than the jump length @xmath4 .",
    "hence it appears that not only the disorder affects @xmath7 .    as outlined above , for relating the theoretical results to experiments in the nonlinear regime",
    ", one should first perform the thermodynamic limit @xmath31 before expanding the current in powers of the field amplitude . by performing this limit",
    "we also clarify the role of rectification effects for large @xmath27 .    for ring systems it is unclear how the periodic boundary conditions affect the stationary current .",
    "we therefore study the analogous problem in an open channel , where particles are injected and ejected from two particle reservoirs on the left and right side with electrochemical potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the rates for the local exchange of particles with the reservoirs fulfill detailed balance with respect to the grand - canonical ensembles associated with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we will treat the linear limit of the rate equations in this work to avoid boundary induced phase transitions as occurring in aseps or taseps .",
    "@xcite    up to now the time - dependent nonlinear current response has been rarely studied.@xcite here we will investigate for both the ring systems and open channels this time - dependent response to a sinusoidal driving with large field amplitude @xmath34 by numerically solving the corresponding rate equations for the occupation probabilities .",
    "the data are analyzed , by using standard fourier analysis , in terms of harmonics @xmath35 of @xmath36th order .",
    "we present results for spatially uncorrelated barrier energies with uniform distributions and discuss the relation of the harmonics in the ring and open channel with respect to different frequency regimes .",
    "for convenient notation , we define @xmath37 as the energy unit in the following , @xmath38 . in a disordered energy landscape with site energies @xmath39 and",
    "energy barriers @xmath40 between sites @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 are considered to be functions of @xmath39 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "in addition they depend on the external bias @xmath47 , which we assume to be homogenous over the ring or channel , corresponding to a linear decrease of the external potential .",
    "if the rates obey detailed balance at each time instant , their ratio @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 in the presence of screening effects , the assumption of a constant potential gradient is not valid , leading to a bias depending on @xmath41 .",
    "the analytical formulae derived in the following sections can be generalized to this situation .    to illustrate our findings we will consider two types of rates and two types of energetic disorder .",
    "for the rates these are the `` exponential rates '' @xmath51 and the glauber rates @xcite @xmath52 = \\gamma\\,\\frac{\\exp(-u_{k , k+1})}{1+\\exp(-\\delta e_{k , k+1})}\\ , , \\label{eq : glauber - rates}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a bare jump rate . for the energetic disorder , we consider either pure barrier disorder ( all @xmath54 ) , or pure site energy disorder ( all barriers @xmath55 ) .",

    "we study the nearest neighbor hopping of one particle on a ring with @xmath27 sites @xmath60 .",

    "the rate equations preserve the normalization @xmath72 .",
    "due to the normalization of the occupation probabilities to one particle , the current @xmath73 refers to the single particle current .",
    "if we consider a fixed number density @xmath36 per lattice site of non - interacting particles , the total current is @xmath74 in the case of charged particles the corresponding charge current per lattice site is @xmath75 and the charge current density @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a cross sectional area associated with each lattice bond .      in a static ( time - independent ) driving field @xmath1 the system reaches a stationary state for long times , where the occupation probabilities become constant , @xmath78 , and all local currents in eq .",
