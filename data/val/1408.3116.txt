    "the brightness of hne stems from an ejection of a much larger amount of @xmath0ni ( 0.2  0.5 @xmath6 ; @xcite ) than canonical supernovae ( @xmath7 , e.g. , @xcite for sn  1987a ) .",

    "the dipole radiation is dissipated between the ns and the shock and thermal pressure drives the shock evolution .",
    "this assumption leads to larger amount of @xmath0ni than more realistic situations because if the conversion from poynting flux to thermal energy is insufficient , the internal energy is smaller and the temperature in the shell is lower than the current evaluation .",
    "therefore , the mass that experienced @xmath92 becomes smaller . *",
    "the shock and energy deposition from the magnetar are spherical , which leads to larger @xmath0ni mass .",
    "this is because fallback of matter onto a ns takes place and reduces @xmath14 , if the explosion energy is concentrated in a small region @xcite .",
    "* all energy radiated by the ns is used for hn component , which is overestimated because a part of the energy should be used to make the relativistic jet component of a grb . *",
    "the density inside the shell is assumed to be the same as the progenitor model .",
    "this assumption results in the higher temperature and the larger @xmath14 than realistic hydrodynamical calculations because the shock enhances not only the pressure but also the density in the shell . *",
    "matter which experiences @xmath92k consists only of @xmath0ni , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "this overestimates @xmath14 because @xmath112 even in the layer which experiences @xmath92 k according to hydrodynamical and nucleosynthesis simulations @xcite .",
    "* the mass cut corresponds to the iron core mass , @xmath113 .",
    "if the ns mass is larger than the iron core mass , the @xmath0ni mass becomes even smaller . *",
    "the ram pressure is neglected in the evolutionary equation of the shell . according to the estimate of the shock propagation time and the free - fall time , in the low luminosity case the shell could not propagate outward for more realistic calculations .    combining these facts ,",
    "our estimation of the @xmath0ni mass is probably highly overestimated so that our constraint on the magnetar parameters ( eq . [ eq : constraint ] ) is rather conservative . interestingly , it is still a stringent constraint ; a very high magnetic field strength and a very rapid rotation are required to explain the brightness of hne .",
    "next , we discuss about more detailed mhd simulations for mechanisms driving ejecta by transferring rotational energy of magnetars using magnetic fields , although the mechanism is different from dipole radiation assumed in this study .",
    "@xcite performed mhd simulations around new - born magnetars from 1 s after supernova shock emergence and found that the energy extracted from magnetars through magnetic fields is confined in the jet ( directed flow ) and the temperature _ can not _ be high enough to produce @xmath0ni even for the most energetic model in their study ( @xmath114 g and @xmath115 rad s@xmath73 ) .",
    "more recently , mhd simulations with detailed microphysics , which run from onset of iron - core collapse to the explosion driven by magnetic fields , showed that the resultant @xmath0ni amount was @xmath116 @xcite for model with @xmath117 g and @xmath118 rad s@xmath73 ( found in * ? ? ? * for hydrodynamic explanations of their models ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath0ni amount can not be amplified even when we take into account such mhd driven outflow .",
    "there have been some studies that tried to explain the plateau phase of the early afterglow by the magnetar scenario because the long lasting activity can be explained by long - living magnetars .",
    "this discriminates magnetar scenario from the collapsar scenario , whose lifetime is determined by the accretion timescale of the hyperaccretion flow .",
    "the typical values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for long grbs are @xmath119 g and @xmath120 rad s@xmath73 @xcite and 3.2  12@xmath121 g and 1.7 - 6.3@xmath122 rad s@xmath73 @xcite .",
    "these values are far less than those given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) . therefore ,",
    "if these grbs are actually driven by a magnetar , we can not expect the bright emission of hne generated by the decay of @xmath0ni . when we observe a grb accompanying a hn ,",

    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) , we need an additional energy source to synthesize @xmath0ni other than the dipole radiation from magnetars .    since the magnetar scenario was recently suggested for the central engine of superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
