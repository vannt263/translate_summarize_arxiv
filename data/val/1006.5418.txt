    "the emergence of a minimal length is widely accepted as a natural requirement when quantum features of spacetime are considered . indeed , the spacetime structure at small distances is rather different from the conventional description in terms of a smooth differential manifold .",
    "when extreme energies probe spacetime , quantum gravitational fluctuations appear and prevent any measure of better accuracy than a natural length scale , e.g. , the planck length ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , we can describe the spacetime in such an extreme regime as a _ quantum foam _ , namely , a complex turbulent storm - tossed sea which accounts for the seething fabric of the universe @xcite .",
    "the presence of a minimal length implies that singularities in general relativity and ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theory are nothing but spurious effects due to the inadequacy of the formalism at small scales / extreme energies , rather than actual physical phenomena . along this line of reasoning , the renormalization procedure , too , even if very effective for its capacity of providing reliable and testable data , is nothing more than an artificial mechanism to get an _ ad hoc _",
    "treatment for the bad short - distance behavior of quantum fields . as a further criticism to renormalization",
    ", there is also the well - known limitation of a systematic employment of regularization schemes when gravity is taken into account . a related problem is provided by the calculation of the cosmological constant : it is not yet clear what is the prescription which leads to a finite and reasonably small value , since trivial infinity subtractions are not viable in the presence of a gravitational coupling .    given this background ,",
    "great efforts have been devoted to implementing a minimal length in physical theories and curing the aforementioned pathologies or limitations of conventional approaches .",
    "for instance , we recall the route opened by the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , according to which the heisenberg commutation relation among coordinates and momenta would be deformed in order to include the effects of an ultraviolet ( and/or an infrared ) cut - off @xcite . in the same spirit ,",
    "several models of noncommutative geometry ( ncg ) have been extensively studied , i.e. , geometries for which coordinate operators might fail to commute , giving rise to an effective graininess of the spacetime manifold ( for general reviews on the topic , see @xcite ) . even if both the gup and ncg are often regarded as mere effective tools or low - energy limits of more fundamental formulations @xcite",
    ", they turn out to be quite successful for their capacity of providing testable predictions and foreseeing new reliable scenarios @xcite . among the most relevant results , we recall that , with a minimal length induced by averaging noncommutative coordinate fluctuations @xcite , the curvature singularity of conventional black hole spacetimes has been tamed @xcite , and a new thermodynamically stable final stage of the hawking evaporation has been determined @xcite ( for a review on these topics , see @xcite ) .    in light of the above results , in this paper",
    ", we would like to do a step forward . in particular",
    ", we would like to apply some of the ncg properties to the computation of the cosmological constant .",
    "this procedure is based on the employment of the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation with the cosmological constant considered as an eigenvalue of a certain sturm - liouville problem .",
    "this approach has been initiated by one of us@xcite , with the purpose of computing the zero - point energy generated by the graviton fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "zero - point energy is a casimir - like energy .",
    "we recall that , for calculating the casimir energy , one generally invokes a subtraction procedure between zero - point energies having the same boundary condition . at the semiclassical level ,",
    "one employs a zeta function regularization scheme to determine finite energy densities , when the graviton one - loop contribution to a classical energy is computed . as a goal of this paper , we want to implement in the wdw equation a ncg - induced minimal length and show how the resulting zero - point energies naturally arise as finite quantities without invoking any regularization scheme .",
    "the wdw equation is a celebrated equation which formally extends to the quantum realm the hamilton - jacobi equation for general relativity , in the same fashion of what the schrdinger equation does for quantum mechanics .",
    "it reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a functional of field configurations on all of spacetime , and the super - hamiltonian @xmath2 provides a hamiltonian constraint , i.e. , restricts @xmath1 to the physical configuration of the geometry and matter content of the universe . the spacetime is supposed to be foliated into a family of spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath3 .",
    "the arnowitt - deser - misner variables offer a valid example of such a foliation .",
    "explicitly , the metric background is written in the familiar form@xmath4 @xmath5 is called the _ lapse function _",
    "@xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the _ shift function_. the dynamical variables are , therefore , the three - dimensional metrics @xmath7 , and their conjugate momenta @xmath8 are called supermomenta .",
    "the replacement of the dynamical variables with the corresponding quantum operators @xmath9 provides the quantization . in the following , for brevity",
    ", we shall skip the  @xmath10  superscript for operator notation . in terms of dynamical variables",
    ", we can define the super - hamiltonian , which reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the supermetric @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the scalar curvature in three dimensions .",
    "the main reason to work with the wdw equation becomes more transparent if we formally rewrite it as @xmath16   \\ \\psi^{\\ast } \\left [   g_{ij}\\right ]   \\ \\left (   \\ \\int_{\\sigma}d^{3}x\\",

    "the related boundary conditions are dictated by the choice of the trial wave functionals which , in our case , are of gaussian type .",
    "different types of wave functionals correspond to different boundary conditions .",
    "we can gain more information if we consider @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the background metric and @xmath22 is a quantum fluctuation around the background .",
    "thus @xmath19 can be expanded in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "since the kinetic part of @xmath23 is quadratic in the momenta , we only need to expand the three - scalar curvature @xmath24 up to the quadratic order . however , to extract the graviton contribution",
    ", we also need an orthogonal decomposition on the tangent space of three - metric deformations @xcite @xmath25 the operator @xmath26 maps the gauge vector @xmath27 into symmetric tracefree tensors @xmath28 @xmath29 is the traceless - transverse component of the perturbation ( tt ) , namely , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the trace of @xmath22 . it is immediate to recognize that the trace element @xmath32 is gauge - invariant .",
    "if we perform the same decomposition also on the momentum @xmath8 , up to second order , @xmath19 becomes @xmath33   ^{\\left (   2\\right )   } \\right\\vert \\psi\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle \\psi|\\psi\\right\\rangle } = -\\frac{\\lambda}{\\kappa}.\\label{lambda0_2}\\ ] ] concerning the measure appearing in @xmath19 , we have to note that the decomposition @xmath34 induces the following transformation on the functional measure @xmath35 , where the jacobian related to the gauge - vector variable @xmath27 is@xmath36   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] this is nothing but the famous faddeev - popov determinant .",
    "it becomes more transparent if @xmath37 is further decomposed into a transverse part @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , and a longitudinal part @xmath40 , with @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "then , @xmath43 can be expressed by an upper triangular matrix for certain backgrounds ( e.g. , schwarzschild in three dimensions ) .",
    "it is immediate to recognize that , for an einstein space in any dimension , cross terms vanish , and @xmath43 can be expressed by a block diagonal matrix . since @xmath44 , the functional measure @xmath45 factorizes into@xmath46   \\right )   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\mathcal{d}h_{ij}^{\\bot}\\ \\mathcal{d}\\xi^{t}\\ \\mathcal{d}\\psi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to the faddeev - popov determinant with @xmath47 acting on transverse vectors . in writing the functional measure @xmath45 , we have here ignored the appearance of a multiplicative anomaly @xcite .",
    "thus , the inner product can be written as@xmath48   \\psi^{\\ast}\\left [   \\xi^{t}\\right ]   \\psi^{\\ast } \\left [   \\sigma\\right ]   \\psi\\left [   h_{ij}^{\\bot}\\right ]   \\psi\\left [   \\xi ^{t}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\ \\psi\\left [   \\sigma\\right ]   \\left (   \\det\\bigtriangleup_{v}^{t}\\right )   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left (   \\det\\left [   \\frac{2}{3}\\bigtriangleup ^{2}+\\nabla_{i}r^{ij}\\nabla_{j}\\right ]   \\right )   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] nevertheless , since there is no interaction between ghost fields and the other components of the perturbation at this level of approximation , the jacobian appearing in the numerator and in the denominator simplify .",
    "the reason can be found in terms of connected and disconnected terms .",
    "the disconnected terms appear in the faddeev - popov determinant , and the above ones are not linked by the gaussian integration .",
    "this means that disconnected terms in the numerator and the same ones appearing in the denominator cancel out .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 factorizes into three pieces .",
    "the piece containing @xmath50 , the contribution of the tt tensors ( tt ) , is essentially the graviton contribution representing true physical degrees of freedom .",
    "regarding the vector operator @xmath51 , we observe that , under the action of infinitesimal diffeomorphism generated by a vector field @xmath52 , the components of @xmath34 transform as follows @xcite:@xmath53 the killing vectors satisfying the condition @xmath54 do not change @xmath22 and thus should be excluded from the gauge group . all other diffeomorphisms act on @xmath22",
    "nontrivially . we need to fix the residual gauge freedom on the vector @xmath27 .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath55 this new gauge fixing produces the same faddeev - popov determinant connected to the jacobian @xmath43 and , therefore , will not contribute to the final value .",

    "however , the gaussian integration does not allow such a mixing , which has to be introduced with an appropriate wave functional . by extracting the tt tensor contribution from @xmath19 within second - order perturbation theory in @xmath22 onto the background @xmath21 , we get@xmath58^{\\left (   2\\right )   } = \\frac{1}{4v}\\int_{\\sigma}d^{3}x\\sqrt{\\bar{g}}\\ g^{ijkl}\\left [   \\left (   2\\kappa\\right ) k^{-1\\bot}\\left (   x , x\\right )   _ { ijkl}\\right .",
