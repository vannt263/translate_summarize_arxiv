    "the _ communication complexity _ of a function @xmath0 is defined as the minimum amount of communication necessary among two parties , conventionally referred to as alice and bob , in order for , say , bob to acquire the value of @xmath1 , where , initially , alice is given @xmath2 and bob is given @xmath3 .",
    "this scenario was introduced by yao @xcite and has been widely studied ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "there are a number of technical choices in the model , such as : whether the communication cost is taken as the worst - case @xmath4 , or the average - case @xmath4 with respect to some probability distribution ; whether the protocols are deterministic or probabilistic ( and , for probabilistic protocols , whether the parties have independent random sources or a shared random source ) ; and , what correctness probability is required .",
    "the communication complexity of the _ inner product modulo two ( ip ) _ function @xmath5 is fairly well understood in the above `` classical '' models .",
    "for worst - case inputs and deterministic errorless protocols , the communication complexity is @xmath6 and , for randomized protocols ( with either an independent or a shared random source ) , uniformly distributed or worst - case inputs , and with error probability @xmath7 required , the communication complexity is @xmath8 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in 1993 , yao @xcite introduced a variation of the above classical communication complexity scenarios , where the parties communicate with _ qubits _ , rather than with bits .",
    "protocols in this model are at least as powerful as probabilistic protocols with independent random sources .",
    "kremer @xcite showed that , in this model , the communication complexity of  is @xmath9 , whenever the required correctness probability is @xmath10 for a constant @xmath11 ( kremer attributes the proof methodology to yao ) .",
    "cleve and buhrman @xcite ( see also @xcite ) introduced another variation of the classical communication complexity scenario that also involves quantum information , but in a different way . in this model ,",
    "alice and bob have an initial supply of particles in an entangled quantum state , such as einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs , but the communication is still in terms of classical bits .",
    "they showed that the entanglement enables the communication for a specific problem to be reduced by one bit .",
    "any protocol in yao s qubit model can be simulated by a protocol in this entanglement model with at most a factor two increase in communication : each qubit can be `` teleported '' @xcite by sending two classical bits in conjunction with an epr pair of entanglement . on the other hand",
    ", we are aware of no similar simulation of protocols in the entanglement model by protocols in the qubit model , and , thus , the entanglement model is potentially stronger .    in this paper , we consider the communication complexity of  in two scenarios : with prior entanglement and qubit communication ; and with prior entanglement and classical bit communication . as far as we know",
    ", the proof methodology of the lower bound in the qubit communication model without prior entanglement @xcite does not carry over to either of these two models .",
    "nevertheless , we show @xmath9 lower bounds in these models .    to state our lower bounds more precisely , we introduce the following notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be a communication problem , and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the communication complexity of @xmath14 in terms of _ qubits _ , where quantum entanglement is available and the requirement is that bob determines the correct answer with probability at least @xmath15 ( the @xmath16 superscript is intended to highlight the fact that prior entanglement is available ) .",
    "also , let @xmath17 denote the corresponding communication complexity of @xmath14 in the scenario where the communication is in terms of _ bits _ ( again , quantum entanglement is available and bob is required to determine the correct answer with probability at least @xmath15 ) .",
    "when @xmath18 , we refer to the protocols as _ exact _ , and , when @xmath19 , we refer to them as _ bounded - error _ protocols . with this notation ,",
    "our results are : @xmath20 note that all the lower bounds are @xmath9 whenever @xmath21 is held constant .",
    "also , these results subsume the lower bounds in @xcite , since the qubit model defined by yao @xcite differs from the bounded - error qubit model defined above only in that it does not permit a prior entanglement .",
    "our lower bound proofs employ a novel kind of `` quantum '' reduction between protocols , which reduces the problem of communicating , say , @xmath6 bits of information to the  problem .",
    "it is noteworthy that , in classical terms , it can be shown that there is no such reduction between the two problems .",
    "the appropriate cost associated with communicating @xmath6 bits is then lower - bounded by the following nonstandard consequence of holevo s theorem .",
    "a slight generalization of theorem 1 is described and proven in the appendix .",
    "it should be noted that , since quantum information subsumes classical information , our results also represent new proofs of nontrivial lower bounds on the _ classical _ communication complexity of , and our methodology is fundamentally different from those previously used for classical lower bounds .",
    "finally , with respect to the question of whether quantum entanglement can _ ever _ be advantageous for protocols computing , we present a curious probabilistic scenario with @xmath22 where prior entanglement enables one bit of communication to be saved .",
    "in this section , we consider exact qubit protocols computing , and prove eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "note that the upper bound follows from so - called `` superdense coding '' @xcite : by sending @xmath23 qubits in conjunction with @xmath23 epr pairs , alice can transmit her @xmath6 classical bits of input to bob , enabling him to evaluate . for the lower bound , we consider an arbitrary exact qubit protocol that computes , and convert it ( in two stages ) to a protocol for which theorem 1 applies .    for convenience ,",
    "we use the following notation . if an @xmath24-qubit protocol consists of @xmath25 qubits from alice to bob and @xmath26 qubits from bob to alice then we refer to the protocol as an @xmath27-qubit protocol .",
    "a _ clean protocol _ is a special kind of qubit protocol that follows the general spirit of the reversible programming paradigm in a quantum setting .",
    "namely , one in which all qubits incur no net change , except for one , which contains the answer .",
    "in general , the initial state of a qubit protocol is of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the state of the entangled qubits shared by alice and bob , and the @xmath30 states can be regarded as `` ancillas '' . at each turn",
    ", a player performs some transformation ( which , without loss of generality , can be assumed to be unitary ) on all the qubits in his / her possession and then sends a subset of these qubits to the other player .",
    "note that , due to the communication , the qubits possessed by each player varies during the execution of the protocol . at the end of the protocol ,",
    "bob measures one of his qubits which is designated as his _",
    "output_.    we say that a protocol which exactly computes a function @xmath1 is _ clean _ if , when executed on the initial state @xmath31 results in the final state @xmath32 ( where the addition is mod 2 ) . the `` input '' , the ancilla , and initial entangled qubits will typically change states during the execution of the protocol , but they are reset to their initial values at the end of the protocol .    it is straightforward to transform an exact @xmath27-qubit protocol into a clean @xmath33-qubit protocol that computes the same function . to reset the bits of the input , the ancilla , and the initial entanglement",
    ", the protocol is run once , except the output is not measured , but recorded and then the protocol is run in the _ backwards _ direction to `` undo the effects of the computation '' .",
    "the output is recorded on a _ new _ qubit of bob ( with initial state @xmath34 ) which is control - negated with the output qubit of bob ( that is in the state @xmath35 ) as the control .",
    "note that , for each qubit that bob sends to alice when the protocol is run forwards , alice sends the qubit to bob when run in the backwards direction .",
    "running the protocol backwards resets all the qubits  except bob s new one  to their original states .",
    "the result is an @xmath33-qubit protocol that maps state ( [ initial ] ) to state ( [ final ] ) .",
    "we now show how to transform a clean @xmath33-qubit protocol that exactly computes  for inputs of size @xmath6 , to an @xmath33-qubit protocol that transmits @xmath6 bits of information from alice to bob .",
    "this is accomplished in four stages :    1 .",
    "bob initializes his qubits indicated in eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "bob performs a hadamard transformation on each of his first @xmath38 qubits .",
    "alice and bob execute the clean protocol for the inner product function .",
    "bob again performs a hadamard transformation on each of his first @xmath38 qubits .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the state of bob s first @xmath38 qubits after the @xmath40 stage .",
    "then @xmath41 where , in eq .",
    "( [ st3 ] ) , the substitution @xmath42 has been made ( and arithmetic over bits is taken mod 2 ) .",
    "the above transformation was inspired by the reading of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the above protocol conveys @xmath6 bits of information ( namely , @xmath43 ) from alice to bob , by theorem 1 , we have @xmath44 .",
    "since this protocol can be constructed from an arbitrary exact @xmath27-qubit protocol for , this establishes the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "note that , classically , no such reduction is possible .",
    "for example , if a clean protocol for  is executed in any classical context , it can never yield more than one bit of information to bob ( whereas , in this quantum context , it yields @xmath6 bits of information to bob ) .",
    "in this section we consider bounded - error qubit protocols for , and prove eq .",
    "( [ qe ] ) .",
    "assume that some qubit protocol @xmath45 computes  correctly with probability at least @xmath15 , where @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath45 is not exact , the constructions from the previous section do not work exactly .",
    "we analyze the extent by which they err .",
    "first , the construction of section 2.1 will not produce a protocol in clean form ; however , it will result in a protocol which _ approximates _ an exact clean protocol ( this type of construction was previously carried out in a different context by bennett _",
    "@xcite ) .    denote the initial state as @xmath47 also , assume that , in protocol @xmath45 , bob never changes the state of his input qubits @xmath48 ( so the first @xmath6 qubits never change ) .",
    "this is always possible , since he can copy @xmath49 into his ancilla qubits at the beginning . after executing @xmath45 until just before the measurement occurs , the state of the qubits must be of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the above ,",
    "the @xmath53 qubit is the designated output , @xmath54 denotes the inner product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath55 denotes the negation of this inner product . in general , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59",
    "may depend on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    now , suppose that the procedure described in section 2.1 for producing a clean protocol in the exact case is carried out for @xmath45 .",
    "since , in general , the answer qubit is not in the state @xmath60or even in a pure basis state  this does not produce the final state @xmath61 however , let us consider the state that is produced instead .",
    "after introducing the _ new _ qubit , initialized in basis state @xmath34 , and applying @xmath45 , the state is @xmath62 after applying the controlled - not gate , the state is @xmath63 finally , after applying @xmath45 in reverse to this state ,",
    "the final state is @xmath64 where @xmath65    note that the vector @xmath66 is the difference between what an exact protocol would produce ( state ( [ exact ] ) ) and what is obtained by using the inexact ( probabilistic ) protocol @xmath45 ( state ( [ finish ] ) ) .",
    "there are some useful properties of the @xmath67 states .",
    "first , as @xmath68 varies , the states @xmath67 are orthonormal , since @xmath48 is a factor in each such state ( this is where the fact that bob does not change his input qubits is used ) .",
    "also , @xmath69 , since only the @xmath70 factor in each such state depends on @xmath71 .",
    "call the above protocol @xmath72 .",
    "now , apply the four stage reduction in section 2.2 , with @xmath72 in place of an exact clean protocol .",
    "the _ difference _ between the state produced by using @xmath72 and using an exact clean protocol first occurs after the third stage and is @xmath73 which has magnitude bounded above by @xmath74 , since , for each @xmath68 , , and the @xmath75 states are orthonormal .",
    "also , the magnitude of this difference does not change when the hadamard transform in the fourth stage is applied .",
    "thus , the final state is within euclidean distance @xmath74 from @xmath76 consider the angle @xmath77 between this final state and ( [ correct ] ) .",
    "it satisfies @xmath78 , from which it follows that @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , if bob measures his first @xmath38 qubits in the standard basis , the probability of obtaining @xmath80 is @xmath81 .    now , suppose that @xmath43 are uniformly distributed",
    ". then fano s inequality ( see , for example , @xcite ) implies that bob s measurement causes his uncertainty about @xmath43 to drop from @xmath6 bits to less than @xmath82 bits , where @xmath83 is the binary entropy function .",
    "thus , the mutual information between the result of bob s measurement and @xmath84 is at least @xmath85 bits . by theorem 1 ,",
    "the communication from alice to bob is at least @xmath86 qubits , which establishes eq .",
    "( [ qe ] ) .",
    "in this section , we consider exact and bounded - error bit protocols for , and prove eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "recall that any @xmath24-qubit protocol can be simulated by a @xmath87-bit protocol using teleportation @xcite ( employing epr pairs of entanglement ) .",
    "also , if the communication pattern in an @xmath24-bit protocol is such that an even number of bits is always sent during each party s turn then it can be simulated by an @xmath88-qubit protocol by superdense coding @xcite ( which also employs epr pairs ) .",
    "however , this latter simulation technique can not , in general , be applied directly , especially for protocols where the parties take turns sending single bits .",
    "we can nevertheless obtain a slightly weaker simulation of bit protocols by qubit protocols for  that is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the result is that , given any @xmath24-bit protocol for @xmath89 ( that is ,   instances of size @xmath6 ) , one can construct an @xmath24-qubit protocol for @xmath90 .",
    "this is accomplished by interleaving two executions of the bit protocol for @xmath89 to compute two independent instances of inner products of size @xmath6 .",
    "we make two observations .",
    "first , by taking the sum ( mod 2 ) of the two results , one obtains an inner product of size @xmath91 .",
    "second , due to the interleaving , an even number of bits is sent at each turn , so that the above superdense coding technique can be applied , yielding a @xmath92-qubit protocol for @xmath90 .",
    "now , eq .  ( [ q ] ) implies @xmath93 , which establishes the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) ( and the upper bound is trivial ) .",
    "if the same technique is applied to any @xmath24-bit protocol computing @xmath89 with probability @xmath94 , one obtains an @xmath24-qubit protocol that computes @xmath90 with probability @xmath95 . applying eq .",
    "( [ qe ] ) here , with @xmath91 replacing @xmath6 and @xmath96 replacing @xmath21 , yields @xmath97 . for @xmath98 , a better bound",
    "is obtained by simply noting that @xmath99 ( since qubits can always be used in place of bits ) , and applying eq .",
    "( [ qe ] ) .",
    "this establishes eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) .",
    "here we will show that in spite of the preceding results , it is still possible that a protocol which uses prior entanglement outperforms all possible classical protocols .",
    "this improvement is done in the probabilistic sense where we look at the number of communication bits required to reach a certain reliability threshold for the  function .",
    "this is done in the following setting .",
    "both alice and bob have a 2 bit vector @xmath100 and @xmath101 , for which they want to calculate the inner product modulo 2 : @xmath102 with a correctness - probability of at least @xmath103 .",
    "it will be shown that with entanglement alice and bob can reach this ratio with 2 bits of communication , whereas without entanglement 3 bits are necessary to obtain this success - ratio .",
    "initially alice and bob share a joint random coin and an epr - like pair of qubits @xmath104 and @xmath105 : @xmath106 with these attributes the protocol goes as follows .",
    "first alice and bob determine by a joint random coin flip who is going to be the ` sender ' and the ` receiver ' in the protocol .",
    "( we continue the description of the protocol by assuming that alice is the sender and that bob is the receiver . ) after this , alice ( the sender ) applies the rotation @xmath107 on her part of the entangled pair and measures this qubit @xmath104 in the standard basis .",
    "the result @xmath108 of this measurement is then sent to bob ( the receiver ) who continues the protocol .",
    "if bob has the input string ` 00 ' , he knows with certainty that the outcome of the function @xmath1 is zero and hence he concludes the protocol by sending the bit @xmath109 to alice .",
    "otherwise , bob performs the rotation @xmath110 on his part of the entangled pair @xmath105 and measure it in the standard basis yielding the value @xmath111 .",
    "now bob finishes the protocol by sending to alice the bit @xmath112 .",
    "using the rotations shown below and bearing in mind the randomization process in the beginning of the protocol with the joint coin flip , this will be a protocol that uses only 2 bits of classical communication and that gives the correct value of @xmath1 with a probability of at least @xmath113 for every possible combination of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the unitary transformations used by the sender in the protocol are : @xmath114 whereas the receiver uses one of the three rotations : @xmath115 the matrices were found by using an optimization program that suggested certain numerical values .",
    "a closer examination of these values revealed the above analytical expressions .",
    "take the probability distribution @xmath116 on the input strings @xmath2 and @xmath3 , defined by : @xmath117 it is easily verified that for this distribution , every _ deterministic _ protocol with only two bits of communication will have a correctness ratio of at most @xmath118 . using theorem 3.20 of @xcite , this shows that every possible randomized protocol with the same amount of communication will have a success ratio of at most @xmath118 .",
    "( it can also be shown that this @xmath118 bound is tight but we will omit that proof here . )",
    "this implies that in order to reach the requested ration of @xmath113 , at least three bits of communication are required if we are not allowed to use any prior entanglement .",
    "a similar result also holds for qubit protocols without prior entanglement @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that after alice applied the rotation @xmath119 and measured her qubit @xmath104 with the result @xmath120 , she knows the state of bob s qubit @xmath105 exactly .",
    "it is therefore also possible to envision a protocol where the parties assume the measurement outcome @xmath120 ( this can be done without loss of generality ) , and for which alice simply sends this qubit @xmath105 to bob , after which bob finishes the protocol in the same way as prescribed by the ` prior entanglement'-protocol .",
    "the protocol has thus become as follows .",
    "first alice and bob decide by a random joint coin flip who is going to be the sender and the receiver in protocol .",
    "( again we assume here that alice is the sender . ) next , alice ( the sender ) sends a qubit @xmath121 ( according to the input string @xmath100 of alice and the table [ qtable ] ) to the receiver bob who continues the protocol .",
    "@xmath122 if bob has the input string @xmath123 , he concludes the protocol by sending a zero bit to alice . in the other case",
    ", bob applies the rotation @xmath124 to the received qubit , measures the qubit in the standard basis , and sends this measurement outcome to alice as the answer of the protocol . by doing so",
    ", the same correctness - probability of @xmath103 is reached for the  function with two qubits of communication , whereas the classical setting requires 3 bits of communication as shown above .",
