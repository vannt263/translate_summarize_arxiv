    "pure su(3 ) gauge theory on the lattice can be formulated in hamiltonian form .",
    "matrix elements of the hamiltonian using any finite orthonormal basis can be used to form a hamiltonian matrix , and the eigenvalues of this matrix , ordered in increasing energy , are each an upper limit to the corresponding eigenvalue of the original hamiltonian.@xcite if the basis is provided with parameters , these can be used to lower the approximate energies closer to their true values .",
    "variational calculations run into problems unless the basis states are carefully chosen .",
    "this is particularly true when many degrees of freedom ( df ) are involved .",
    "the most serious problem is that the eigenvalues of the matrix may be useless because they lie far above the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and do not accurately portray the physical implications of the hamiltonian , quantitatively or even qualitatively .",
    "another problem associated with many df is that the basis size can become unmanageable .",
    "if we work on a @xmath0 spatial lattice , there are @xmath1 degrees of freedom .",
    "( there are 3 links emerging from each site on the lattice , and 8 colors per link . )",
    "when we introduce two states for each df , as we will , we have a basis of @xmath2 states .",
    "further cuts must be made .",
    "as we do this , we also want to build symmetries of the hamiltonian into the basis so that quantum numbers can be assigned to the eigenvalues of the matrix .",
    "the foundation of a variational calculation is therefore the crafting of a well - chosen basis .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to construct a basis for pure su(3 ) lattice gauge theory and demonstrate that it is well - chosen . in this introduction",
    "we outline the issues that must be faced in the construction process , and how we cope with them . in following sections",
    "we compare results obtained with our basis to known results , thus testing the adequacy of the basis .",
    "this comparison can be made only in a limiting case , but that case imposes significant tests .",
    "the methods we use can be applied away from the limit to the `` physical '' case , where the lattice is inhabited by glueballs .",
    "we outline how to do this at the end of the paper .",
    "the approach we take in this paper is clearly an approximation . on the other hand , the customary evaluation of the path integral by monte carlo sampling",
    "can , in principle , be arbitrarily accurate as more computing resources are devoted to the project .",
    "but that project has been ongoing for 30 years , using the most advanced computing facilities in the world . the payoff to our approach",
    "is that the computer resources required are very modest .",
    "we begin with a description of the elements required to write the hamiltonian for pure su(3 ) local gauge theory on a three dimensional lattice .",
    "we label links on our lattice by the pair @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the site from which a link departs , with @xmath5 , and the lattice is an @xmath6 cube .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 is the direction of the link .",
    "the variables assigned to a link degree of freedom specify a point on the su(3 ) manifold , a compact manifold of eight dimensions labelled by @xmath10 , the color index . in the hamiltonian we use the fundamental representation matrix @xmath11 , which depends on the point on su(3 ) for link @xmath3 .",
    "we also use the operators @xmath12 with @xmath10 .",
    "the action of @xmath13 on a representation of su(3 ) is to left - multiply it by the @xmath14th generator matrix for that representatrion .",
    "similarly , @xmath15 acts to right - multiply .",
    "@xmath16 multiplies by the quadratic casimir operator for su(3 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is then : @xmath17 @xmath18.\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath19 is the kogut - susskind hamiltonian.@xcite it commutes with the generators of local gauge transformations at site @xmath20 : @xmath21    the hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory has been used for a number of studies , mostly based on loop expansions that differ from the approach we take here . for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "the first step in building a basis is to choose states on the su(3 ) manifold for each link . to make the choice , we need to know where on the manifold the eigenfunctions of @xmath19 have support ( are large ) , and this depends on the coupling @xmath22 .",
    "we begin with small @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to use the parametrization for the fundamental representation matrix @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a gell - mann matrix.@xcite we next develop ascending power series in @xmath22 for the elements in the hamiltonian @xmath25 to study support , we examine a `` lattice '' consisting of one link .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath22 , the hamiltonian is @xmath26=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial   { \\bf r}^2}+\\frac{{\\bf r}^2}{2}.\\ ] ] if we treat @xmath27 as an eight dimensional euclidean vector , the ground state of @xmath28 is @xmath29 the euclidean approximation is justified when @xmath22 is small because then the group parameters @xmath30 are small where the wave function is large , and the fact that su(3 ) is not euclidean can be ignored . at weak coupling , therefore",
    ", wave functions have support only near the group origin .",
    "as @xmath22 grows , the region on the manifold where the wave function is large expands . at large @xmath22 we know from strong coupling expansions that wave functions have support everywhere on the manifold@xcite .",
    "therefore , we seek gaussian - like states on the manifold , centered on the origin , with width that can be tuned as a variational parameter .",
    "gaussian - like states on the group are generated by the kernel of the heat equation@xcite .",
    "@xmath31 the weak coupling , euclidean approximation demonstates that the kernel is gaussian : @xmath32 we will use the scaled width variable @xmath33 . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : onelink ] ) and ( [ eq : kernel ] ) , for one link at weak coupling @xmath34 .",
    "this is the order of magnitude for @xmath35 that we will find for a large lattice at weak coupling .    the heat kernel on su(3 ) is@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 are group parameters",
    ", @xmath38 is the character , @xmath39 is the dimension of representation @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the casimir eigenvalue.@xcite note that when @xmath42 is small ( narrow gaussian ) , many representations contribute .",
    "this mirrors the situation in euclidean space , where many harmonics are required to build up a narrow gaussian .    in eucliean space",
    ", gaussians can be extended to a complete set of basis states by multiplication by polynomials or by differentiation , and the same can be done on su(3 ) .",
    "the simplest of these states are @xmath43 the orthogonality properties of these states are@xcite @xmath44 matrix elements of the operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) among states @xmath45 and @xmath46 are computed in ref .",
    "the dynamics of su(3 ) is invoked through the use of these matrix elements .    on each link ,",
    "we allow single excitations to occur in each of the eight colors . we exclude states that are _",
    "multiply _ excited in the same color direction .",
    "since each of the eight color directions on a link can be unexcited ( @xmath45-like ) or singly excited ( @xmath46-like ) , our basis has @xmath47 states per link .",
    "an important topic of the paper will be to test the adequacy of limiting the basis to 256 states on each link in this way .    states in which two color directions on a link are excited , designated @xmath48 , are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but states in which @xmath49 directions are excited have not been studied . extending the number of color directions excited on a link in the explicit manner of ref .",
    "@xcite is laborious and will not be attempted in this paper .",
    "the process is also ambiguous because the operator @xmath50 used in the definition of @xmath46 and @xmath48 can be replaced by others , like @xmath51 . instead ,",
    "in this paper we introduce states with `` multi - color '' excitations on a link , and matrix elements involving these states , in a straighforward way we describe in the next subsection .",
    "the lattice basis constructed by putting each link in one of the 256 states we have introduced has @xmath52 elements , which is far too many to handle .",
    "in addition , local degrees of freedom constitute an awkward basis for describing phenomena that range over many links .",
    "continuum field theory instructs us how to depart from local degrees of freedom by recasting the theory in momentum space .",
    "we adopt that method in this paper .",
    "we introduce operators @xmath53 .",
    "these are bosonic , satisfying the usual bosonic commutation rules .",
    "the ground state @xmath54 corresponds to the normalized state @xmath55 on a link , and @xmath56 corresponds to the state @xmath57 on the link . at this point",
    "we can describe how we represent a normalized state in which two distinct colors are excited on the same link ; it is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "we now follow field theory and introduce nonlocal states by passing to momentum space , introducing the bosonic operators @xmath60      we return to the requirement that the state on each link be required to be in one of 256 states .",
    "applications of operators @xmath61 with @xmath62 produce states beyond the ones we ve introduced .",
    "we refer to such states as `` overexcited '' .",
    "overexcited states will appear unless we suppress them .",
    "first we introduce an operator that measures the excitation of the color / link degrees of freedom .",
    "it is @xmath63 a color / link degree of freedom in the @xmath64-th bosonic state is an eigenfunction of @xmath65 with eigenvalue @xmath64 .",
    "our method of minimizing the contribution of overexcited states to our basis is to control the expectation value of @xmath65 in our basis states .    with the introduction of @xmath65",
    ", we can begin to construct the basis .",
    "first we write @xmath19 in terms of our bosonic operators .",
    "coefficients are chosen so that matrix elements on the basis of the two states for each color / link agree with matrix elements derived in ref .",
    "next we decompose @xmath19 into a term @xmath66 , quadratic in @xmath67 and @xmath68 and a remainder : @xmath69 equipped with this decomposition , we construct a generator operator @xmath70 , whose low - lying eigenstates will compose our basis .",
    "the first expression for @xmath70 is @xmath71 by limiting @xmath72 to quadratic terms , it becomes an operator that can be diagonalized .",
    "its eigenstates can be constructed , leading to an explicit basis .",
    "we take @xmath73 to be a positive parameter , so the term @xmath74 in @xmath72 reduces the contribution of overexcited states to the low energy spectrum of @xmath72 , where the states in our basis are found . by changing @xmath73 ,",
    "we can adjust @xmath75 for the eigenstates of @xmath72 . define @xmath76 to be the expectation of @xmath65 per color / link df in the ground state of @xmath72 : @xmath77 .",
    "most of our simulations will be carried out with @xmath78 .",
    "this small value suggests that the probability of finding a color / link to be overexcited is small , and it is .",
    "we will present a formula giving the probability that a color / link is in _ any _ overexcited state , and the typical result ( when @xmath78 ) is about 1/8 .",
    "therefore , overexcited states contribute to results computed in our basis , but not much .",
    "we have some ability to check on the influence of overexcited states by changing @xmath73 and hence @xmath76 .",
    "we do not want to make @xmath76 too small , however , because we do not want to suppress the 256 states we allow for each link .",
    "another method of excluding overexcited states would be to map pure su(3 ) onto a spin model , with each color / link being in either a `` spin up '' or `` spin down '' state .",
    "this would eliminate overexcited states altogether , but it would deny us the methods of field theory , particularly the simple introduction of nonlocal degrees of freedom by transforming to momentum space .    to summarize our procedure ,",
    "we have adopted a bosonic formalism .",
    "this allows us to pass to momentum space and construct a basis that is nonlocal .",
    "the price we pay is that there are contributions from overexcited bosonic states that are unwanted . by taking our basis states to be eigenstates of the generator @xmath72",
    ", we can use the parameter @xmath73 to minimize and assess the effects of the overexcited states .",
    "we seek states having @xmath79 .",
    "there are three options for excluding non - gauge invariant states .",
    "one is to rewrite the theory in terms of gauge invariant df only .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting hamiltonians are nonlocal and are not manifestly under rotations of the cubic lattice@xcite .",
    "they are unsuited for approximation schemes .",
    "the second option is to use hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) but allow only gauge invariant states in the basis .",
    "this is done when loop expansions are employed.@xcite however , sound arguments have led us adopt the eigenstates of @xmath72 as basis states , and these states are not gauge invariant .",
    "the third option is to compute with a nonzero expectation value , per site , of the group quadratic casimir operator : @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the ground state of @xmath72 , and @xmath81 this is the option we adopt .",
    "we will calculate results for several values of @xmath82 and extrapolate to the limit @xmath83 at the end .",
    "this was done successfully for the ground state in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we use the same method here . note that @xmath84 is a positive operator , so when @xmath83 , gauge invariance is imposed at every site on the lattice .",
    "once we include gauge non invariant states in our basis , we want to control their number .",
    "this can be accomplished by adding a term to @xmath70 that raises the eigenvalue of such states . to do this",
    ", we decompose @xmath85 into quadratic and higher terms , just as we did for @xmath19 @xmath86 we add term proportional to @xmath87 to our generator , which we call @xmath88 after the modification . @xmath89 the factor @xmath90 is included because @xmath91 is finite as @xmath92 .",
    "finally we introduce @xmath93 , the hamiltonian we use in the rest of this paper .",
    "@xmath94 @xmath19 and @xmath93 have the same set of physical , gauge invariant eigenstates .",
    "however , the non - gauge invariant eigenstates of @xmath93 are raised in energy by the positive operator @xmath95 . by varying @xmath96",
    "we can control the number of gauge non invariant states in the low energy spectrum .",
    "our basis states are the low - lying eigenstates of generator @xmath88 . to diagonalize @xmath88 we must remove operators of the form @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this is accomplished by means of the bogoliubov transformation to new bosonic operators @xmath99 : @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "( directional indices for @xmath103 will be introduced later , after we transform to the polarization basis . )",
    "we use the vacuum state of @xmath88 after the bogoliubov transformation to determine the expectation values @xmath76 and @xmath82 .",
    "these parameters are set primarily by choice of @xmath73 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath96 is used to set the number of non gauge invariant states in the low energy spectrum of @xmath88 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is invariant under the group of rotations of the cubic lattice .",
    "associated with this symmetry is degeneracy ; states belonging to different rows of the same irreducible representation of the group are degenerate .",
    "such degeneracy complicates computer work .",
    "it can be reduced by forming linear combinations of our basis states that belong to the same row of an irreducible representation of the group : @xmath104 is an irreducible representation of the group , and @xmath105 is the image of @xmath106 under a rotation of the cube .",
    "the group of rotations of the cube has 24 elements@xcite .",
    "it has five irreducible representations ( because there are five classes ) , which we label by their dimensions : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "( the sum of the squares of these dimensions is the order of the group , implying that eq .",
    "( [ eq : group ] ) provides 24 states for each @xmath106 . )",
    "an additional reason to take account of the symmetry group is that we wish to identify the spins of the states we find .",
    "since our lattice breaks the o(3 ) symmetry of continuum field theory , this identification is not obvious .",
    "note , however that each of the 24 rotations of the cube corresponds to an element of o(3 ) .",
    "the identity element corresponds to a rotation by @xmath112 , and each of the other elements corresponds to a rotation by @xmath113 , @xmath114 or a multiple of these about an axis through the center of the cube .",
    "it follows that every irreducible representation of o(3 ) generates a representation of the group of the cube , which is generally reducible .",
    "the first few clebsch - gordon series giving the content of o(3)-induced representations are @xmath115 in these four cases , a representation of the group of the cube is identified with a spin .",
    "however , an eigenstate belonging to the @xmath109 representation of the cube can be associated with spin 2 only if there is an eigenstate belonging to the @xmath111 of nearly the same energy .",
    "if this is not the case , it may not be possible to identify the @xmath109 eigenstate with a continuum state .    in this paper we will study spin 0 states .",
