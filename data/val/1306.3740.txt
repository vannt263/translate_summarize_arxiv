    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors@xcite has triggered a new round of intensive research of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "one early dispute focused on the attribute of the iron @xmath0 electrons : whether they are itinerant quasi - particles like those in metals , or localized magnetic moments like those in mott insulators . underlying this dichotomy between the itinerant electron and the local moment",
    "are the two different schools of thoughts for superconductivity ( sc ) : the weakly correlated bardeen - cooper - schrieffer@xcite ( bcs ) theory based on the electron fermi - liquid , and the strongly correlated resonant valence bound@xcite ( rvb ) theory arising from the doped mott insulator .",
    "after five years of experimental and theoretical study , today it seems that the consensus is converging@xcite to the idea of coexistence of both itinerant and local degrees of freedom .",
    "due to the multi - orbtial ( multi - band ) nature , the orbital - selective mott ( osm ) transition@xcite may take place in the iron - based compounds , allowing the electrons to play multiple roles at the same time .",
    "based on the experimental evidences,@xcite several versions of the itinerant electrons and local moments hybrid theory were proposed by the authors of ref . , and its rich phase diagram was studied in ref .. in this scenario , the fe @xmath1-orbital electrons are separated into two well - defined degrees of freedom : itinerant electrons and local moments , and they are coupled together through the residual on - site hund s rule interaction . the iron - based sc is understood as the pairing of itinerant electrons glued by the ( para-)magnon of local moments , while the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order in the parent compounds is considered as a joint ordering of both degrees of freedom whose ordering tendencies are mutually enhanced by the hund s rule coupling .    out of the sdw phase , the local moments were assumed to be in a disordered paramagnetic ground state , which is compatible with the non - magnetic sc phase at low temperature . however , motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the gap - like hump - dip feature in the normal phase,@xcite we conjecture that the local moments may be effectively described by a bosonic spin - liquid state , with gapped deconfined spinons , which is important for a consistent explanation ( to be discussed in the following ) of the observed hump - dip feature .    based on this assumption ,",
    "we develope a two - fluid description for iron - based superconductors , which contains two liquid components : the itinerant electron _ fermi - liquid _ and the local moment _ spin - liquid_. the spin - liquid@xcite physics is characterized by a mean - field theory for spinons,@xcite which are the low - energy excitations of the spin - liquid . here",
    "we assume bosonic spinons,@xcite which are then coupled to the fermionic itinerant electron via the residual hund s rule interaction , making the system a bose - fermi mixture . within the minimal model , we examine the fermi - liquid instability in coupling with the spin - liquid , the resonance modes between the two fluids , and the low - energy collective modes originated from the coupling .",
    "the main discovery was that in the intermediate coupling region , there exists a composite fermion bound - state made up of an electron and a spinon , which is close to but gapped from the fermi surface and carries unit electron charge and integer spin .",
    "we proposed that such a composite mode may account for the hump - dip feature@xcite in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments .",
    "admittedly the two - fluid description is just a low - energy effective theory about the interplay between the spin and the charge degrees of freedoms in the iron - based compounds , but not intended to provide a complete or realistic modeling of the material .",
    "for example , we have omitted the orbital degrees of freedom , which has been found to be another important ingredient of the material by many experiments.@xcite as we mainly focus on the sdw and sc phases in the phase diagram , where the orbital fluctuation plays a minor effect,@xcite the two - fluid description should be sufficient to capture the main physics in many aspects .",
    "the incorporation of the orbital physics will be left for future research .    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will introduce the two fluid description in the hamiltonian formalism , by setting up the models for the fermi - liquid and the spin - liquid respectively .",
    "the model is then summarized and reformulated in the path integral formalism in section iii . the hund s rule interaction couples the two fluid components together to produce low - energy collective excitations : magnons and composite fermions , which are discussed respectively in section iv and v. concluding remarks are given in section vi .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review the itinerant electron and local moment hybrid model , based on which , the two - fluid description will be introduced in the following sections .",
    "the hybrid model@xcite is given by the hamiltonian @xmath2 @xmath3 describes the itinerant electrons near the fermi surface hopping on the fe square lattice @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote the fermion operators for itinerant electrons , with @xmath6 labeling the fe sites , @xmath7 labeling the itinerant orbitals ( bands ) and @xmath8 labeling the electron spins .",
    "@xmath9 is some tight - binding model parameters that can be determined from the local density approximation ( lda ) calculation or by fitting to the angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) observations .",
    "@xmath10 describes the exchange coupling between local moments in the orbital - selective mott bands @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the local moment on each site .",
    "the moment size is roughly spin-1 , as suggested by the x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) observations.@xcite . here the local moment , though maybe large , is an effective one presumably dressed by the higher energy itinerant electrons , which is not quite well quantized , and may be still subject to much larger quantum fluctuations than the usual heisenberg spins .",
    "@xmath13 describes the effective exchange coupling strength between site @xmath14 and site @xmath15 , which could be determined by fitting its resulting spin wave spectrum to the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) observations .",
    "many have proposed the @xmath16-@xmath17 model@xcite or its variants as the magnetic model for the iron - based compounds , which contains nearest - neighbor @xmath16 and next - nearest - neighbor @xmath17 exchange couplings . for large @xmath18 , the @xmath16-@xmath17 model can give rise to the collinear magnetic ordering fig.[fig : j1j2](a ) , as observed in many compounds.@xcite however around @xmath19 , the model can be strongly frustrated , and may support the spin - liquid state ( a paramagnetic quantum ground state).@xcite moreover , the competing ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) ( or double - exchange ) interaction introduced by the itinerant electron@xcite and the ring exchange interaction in the intermediate correlated system@xcite both tend to stabilize the spin - liquid state .",
    "@xmath20 describes the residual ferromagnetic hund s rule interaction@xcite between itinerant electrons and local moments @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spin operator for itinerant electrons , with @xmath23 being the three pauli matrices , not to be confused with the spin index .",
    "@xmath24 represents the hund s rule coupling strength .    at a first glance",
    ", the hybrid model looks similar to the kondo lattice model@xcite for the heavy - fermion system , both having the itinerant electrons magnetically coupling to the local moments .",
    "in fact , d. pines and his collaborators@xcite have proposed a similar two - fluid description for the kondo lattice , which states that the system may be viewed as a combination of the heavy fermion fluid and the screened kondo centers .",
    "our work is inspired by their proposal .",
    "however , an important difference between the two models is that the hund s rule coupling is ferromagnetic , while the kondo coupling is antiferromagnetic . under renormalization",
    "flow,@xcite the ferromagnetic coupling will become weaker , as opposite to the antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "so there is no kondo screening in the iron - based compounds . in the low - energy limit ,",
    "the itinerant electrons and the local moments are well - defined degrees of freedom , and the hund s rule coupling can be treated as a perturbation .    based on the hybrid model , we will establish the minimal effective model for the itinerant electrons and the local moments in the following sections .",
    "we propose that the itinerant electrons can be described by the fermi - liquid , and the local moments can be described by the spin - liquid .",
    "the interplay between the two fluid components would give rise to the sdw , sc phases and the hump - dip feature in the normal phase .",
    "although the iron - based superconductor involves a rather complicated multi - band electronic structure , only the bands near the fermi level are responsible for electron itineracy . in most families of the iron - based superconductor compounds , it is observed that the fermi surface usually consists of totally four pockets : two hole pockets around @xmath25 point and two electron pockets around @xmath26 ( or equivalently @xmath27 ) point@xcite ( through out this paper , we will stick to the convention of fe unit cell and the corresponding brillouin zone , see fig.[fig : lattice bz ] ) .",
    "the scattering between @xmath28 and @xmath29 pockets turn out to be the most important scattering channel , because the momentum connecting @xmath28 and @xmath29 pockets , i.e. @xmath30 , matches the collinear ordering momentum of the local moment , so that the itinerant electron is most strongly scattered with the local moment in this channel .",
    "is set to unity through out this article .",
    "the shaded area is the fe unit cell .",

    "the unfolded fe bz of fe lattice is bounded by the solid lines .",
    "the folded bz for the itinerant electron ( local moment spinon ) is reshaped into the red ( blue ) rectangle .",
    "the momentum is measured in unit of @xmath31 : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the nesting momentum @xmath30 connecting the electron pockets ( red circles around @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) is also the ordering momentum connecting the two spinon band softening points ( blue crossings at @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) . ]    to simplify the problem , we consider the minimal two - pocket model@xcite by keeping only two itinerant bands : one hole band around @xmath28 point and one electron band around @xmath29 point .",
    "this model retains the most essential scattering channel between @xmath28 and @xmath29 pockets , making it capable to describe generic phases in iron - based compounds , such as the sdw and the @xmath36-wave sc .",
    "the extension to the more realistic four - pocket ( or even five - orbial ) model is straight forward .",

    "@xmath42 is the momentum deviation measured from the @xmath28 or @xmath29 point .",
    "we may simply take the following parabolic band structure ( see fig.[fig : c band ] ) , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electron effective mass , and @xmath45 controls the indirect gap between hole and electron bands .",
    "the negative @xmath45 corresponds to the _ semimetal _ band structure in fig.[fig : c band ] , that the hole and electron bands overlap slightly in energy , which is the case for most iron - based compounds@xcite ( 1111- , 122- , and 111-type ) .",
    "the positive @xmath45 gives the _ semiconductor _ band structure , which is also seen@xcite in k@xmath46fe@xmath47se . in this work ,",
    "we will only focus on the negative @xmath45 semimetal case .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath48 controls the electron doping . for this particular model , the @xmath28 and @xmath29 pockets",
    "are perfectly nested at @xmath49 through the nesting vector @xmath50 , which might not be the case in reality .",
    "the perfect nesting point here should be understood as the maximally nested case in the real material .",
    "ev@xmath51 and @xmath52mev .",
    "dashed line indicates the fermi level , determined by the chemical potential @xmath48 .",
    "the zero - energy level is set to the maximally nested level . ]",
    "admittedly , the two pocket model explicitly breaks the 4-fold rotation symmetry of fe square lattice , and hence is not capable to describe the nematic ordering in iron - based compounds .",
    "also the details about orbital components are neglected , so the orbital - related features are not presented in our model , such as the nodal sdw and the orbital fluctuation / ordering . extending the two pocket model to the more realistic four pocket model and including the orbital details in the band structure will presumably enable us to incoproate the orbital physics , which has been found to be another important ingredient of iron - based compounds , into our theoretical framework . however in this work ,",
    "we will first focus on the interplay between itinerant electron and local moment magnetism , and leave the orbital physics for future research .",
    "thus as a proof - of - principle study , we will simply use the two - pocket model to describe the itinerant electron system .",
    "the ground state of the itinerant electron system is a weakly correlated fermi - liquid .",
    "the various fermi - surface instabilities at low temperature are responsible for both the sdw and sc ordering in the iron - based compounds . around @xmath49",
    "the good nesting condition gives rise to a strong sdw instability , and the itinerant electron will settle down in the sdw phase at low temperature . for larger absolute value of @xmath48 ( either positive or negative ) , the nesting condition is destroyed , and the sdw instability fades away and gives way to the sc instability .",
    "the pairing of itinerant electron is mediated by the underlying local moment fluctuation , or the magnon , whose energy scale is much higher than the phonon glue in conventional superconductors , leading to higher sc transition temperature .",
    "thus the high-@xmath53 sc phase appearing in the iron - based compounds upon doping is understandable .",
    "away from the sdw phase in the iron - based superconductors , no magnetic order is observed , which suggests that the local moment can not order at low temperature by itself , unless it is assisted by coupling to a nearly nested itinerant fermi surface with strong sdw instability .",
    "the local moment could remain disordered at low temperature , if the exchange coupling @xmath13 in eq .",
    "is strongly frustrated , or if the moment amplitude fluctuates due to the relative small ( orbital - selective ) mott gap@xcite ( @xmath54ev ) , both tending to stabilize the spin - liquid@xcite ground state .",
    "many recent studies have revealed the possibility of the spin - liquid phase in the @xmath16-@xmath17 model.@xcite however given the robust collinear sdw ordering observed in many parent compounds of the iron - based materials , we suspect that even if the local moment ground state is disordered , it must be close to the collinear afm ordering .",
    "therefore we postulate that the local moments in the iron - based compounds may be approximately described by a spin - liquid state with short - ranged collinear afm correlations .",
    "the elementary excitations in the spin - liquid state include the _",
    "spinons_,@xcite which are spin-1/2 bosons as fractionalized@xcite from the spin-1 local moment .",
    "the low - energy properties of the spin - liquid can be described by an effective hamiltonian for spinons . on each site @xmath14",
    ", we introduce the schwinger bosons @xmath55",
    "( @xmath56),@xcite such that the local moment @xmath12 can be decomposed into @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "we choose the bosonic spinon ( schwinger boson ) representation other than the fermionic representation , because the former can be easily connected to the magnetically ordered states ( e.g. the collinear afm in the context of iron - based materials ) by condensation of the bosonic spinons .",
    "each spinon carries spin-1/2 , and on each fe site , the local moment is made up of roughly @xmath59 spinons aligned in the same direction , such that the total spin is @xmath60 ( corresponding to the magnetic moment @xmath61 with @xmath62 ) .",
    "such a setting can give quantitative account@xcite of the ordered moment ( @xmath63 ) observed in experiments.@xcite    the most general mean - field hamiltonian includes both the spinon pairing and hopping on the fe square lattice@xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 is the spin - singlet pairing strength .",

    "@xmath68 is the levi - civita symbol , such that @xmath69 denotes the singlet pairing of spinons .",
    "the spinon representation has an u(1 ) gauge redundancy , as the local u(1 ) transformation @xmath70 leaves the local moment @xmath71 ( and hence all physical results ) invariant .",
    "however the mean - field parameters in eq . are not gauge invariant , and should transform as @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "so the phase fluctuations of the mean - field parameters are subject to the u(1 ) gauge structure .",
    "to prevent the gauge fluctuation from confining the spinons , we require the simultaneous presentation of both the hoping and pairing mean - field , so as to break the u(1 ) gauge structure to @xmath74 , and to gap the gauge fluctuations.@xcite in this case , the infrared behavior of mean - field theory eq .",
    "is well under control , and the spinon remains the only low energy excitation .",

    "but we will not follow this variational approach here .",
    "we just construct a bosonic spin - liquid by symmetry arguments , and calculate its spin excitation spectrum .",
    "then the parameters are chosen to fit the observed ins spectrums . in our approach ,",
    "the spin - liquid is merely a language to describe the disordered quantum ground state of the local moments .    to calculate the spectrum ,",
    "we switch to the momentum space , in which the mean - field hamiltonian in eq .",
    "takes the form @xmath89 with the spinon operators arranged into the bogoliubov basis @xmath90 following the particle - hole , sublattice and spin degrees of freedom .",

    "the high symmetry momentum points are defined in fig.[fig : lattice bz](b ) . ]",
    "we shall focus on the low - energy effect theory by projecting the hamiltonian into the lower branch .",
    "we first perform a momentum - dependent basis rotation along the @xmath102 direction ( in the sublattice space ) to transform the hamiltonian eq . to @xmath103 , which has the following block - diagonalized form @xmath104 the inner block corresponds to the lower branch of the spinon spectrum .",
    "the hamiltonian in this block reads @xmath105 , which acts on the truncated basis @xmath106 with the sublattice degrees of freedom projected .",
    "one may absorb @xmath107 into @xmath67 by defining @xmath108 , and write @xmath109 as shown in fig.[fig : b band ] , the spinon spectrum is soften at @xmath110 points .",
    "expanding the hamiltonian around the softening points @xmath111 yields @xmath112 where @xmath42 denotes the small momentum deviation from the softening points , and @xmath113 thus we have reduced the spinon lattice model eq . to its low - energy effective model",

    "point indicates that the spin - liquid is close to the collinear afm order . ]",
    "therefore the spinon mean - field hamiltonian eq .",
    "does describe a fully gapped @xmath74 spin - liquid close to the collinear afm order .",
    "such a spin - liquid description can simultaneously capture the long - range magnetic disorder and the short - range collinear afm correlation of the local moments .",
    "it could be more appropriate if the local moment is not well - quantized , such that the confinement force between the spinons is weaker .",
    "this is indeed the case in the iron - based compounds , where the orbital - selective mott gap is not very large ( @xmath117ev),@xcite which may be sufficient to suppress the charge fluctuation , but not large enough to precisely quantize the local moment .",
    "this leads to the ring - exchange interaction among the local moments , which tends to stabilize@xcite the deconfined spin - liquid state in the spin-1 systems .",
    "so it could be easier for the local moment to fractionalize into deconfined spinons in the intermediate correlated systems such as the iron - based compounds , which supports the spin - liquid description .      using the spinon representation , the hund s rule interaction @xmath20 in eq .",
    "can be express as follows @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the effective coupling strength between itinerant electrons and spinons . @xmath120 and @xmath121 label their spins respectively , which are summed over implicitly .    in the momentum space , the hamiltonian reads @xmath122 @xmath123 labels the two pockets of itinerant electrons .",

    "both the sdw and sc instabilities develop mainly through the inter - pocket scattering channel . while both scattering channels are responsible for the hump - dip feature in the normal phase .",

    "let us consider the stm differential conductance @xmath429 , also known as the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurement .",
    "when the electron is injected to the material from the stm tip , it can grasp a spinon to form the composite fermion . given",
    "the inhomogeneity observed in many iron - based superconductors , we may assume local condensation of spinons , i.e. @xmath430 locally .",
    "if the tip happens to be suspended above the local condensate , the injected electron can immediately become composite fermion @xmath431 or @xmath432 , and the electric current is carried on by the composite fermion .",
    "therefore the composite fermion should also contribute to the differential conductance @xmath429 spectrum , @xmath433 where @xmath434 is the derivative of the fermi distribution .",
    "a typical spectrum is shown in red in fig.[fig : didv ] , which has an asymmetric hump - dip feature with a hump below the fermi level and a dip near the fermi level , dubbed as the `` pseudo - gap '' in literature.@xcite the hump corresponds to the emergent composite fermion mode marked out by arrows in fig.[fig : sfdfmap](b ) .",
    "its energy scale is controlled by the spinon gap @xmath210 at around 10mev . while the dip is due to the lack of composite fermion spectrum in the gap of the electron - spinon continuum .",
    "so the hump - dip feature in the sts spectrum is nothing but the gap of composite fermions ( electron - spinon joint excitations ) , which is naturally pinned at the fermi level ( as controlled by the spinon gap ) , and will not shift with the electron doping .",
    "the asymmetric sts line shape about the fermi level is due to the finite doping away from the perfect nesting level ( modeled by the finite @xmath290mev here ) . from fig.[fig : didv](a ) , one can see the gap feature starts out symmetric at perfect nesting ( @xmath237mev ) , and becomes more and more asymmetric as @xmath48 shifting away .",
    "as the fermi level deviates from the perfect nesting , the electron and hole bands are not symmetric to each other about the fermi level , which leads to the asymmetric electron - spinon continuum and hence the asymmetric composite fermion spectrum . for electron doping ,",
    "the electron - spinon joint spectral weight below the fermi level is stronger as in fig.[fig : sfdfmap](a ) , which will push the composite mode upwards under the level - repulsion effect .",
    "so the composite mode at the lower edge will be pushed into the gap and becomes a resonance mode , while that at the upper edge will be pushed into the continuum and damp out . thus we conclude that the electron ( hole ) doping causes the composite fermion mode to emerge from below ( above ) the fermi level ( see fig.[fig : sfdfmap](b ) for the electron doped case ) .",
    "this doping dependence of the composite fermion energy has been observed recently . in the electron",
    "doped nafe@xmath435co@xmath436as sample,@xcite the hump structure ( signature of the composite fermion ) appears below the fermi level ; while in the hole doped ba@xmath437k@xmath46fe@xmath438as@xmath438 sample,@xcite the hump structure appears above the fermi level . comparing both experiments refs . and",

    "the hump - dip feature will eventually be smeared out by the thermal broadening as in fig.[fig : didv](b ) .",
    "these features are also consistent with the observation@xcite in the 111-type compounds .      as a resonance mode of the coupled itinerant electron and the spinon ,",
    "the composite fermion will be influenced by both the components of the fermi - liquid and the spin - liquid in the two - fluid description . in this section",
    ", we will discuss how the composite fermion responses to the itinerant electron pairing and the external magnetic field .",
    "consider the @xmath36-wave pairing of the itinerant electron , with sc gap @xmath440 .",
    "then the itinerant electron is no longer gapless excitations : at least an additional energy of the amount of @xmath440 must be paid to excite the electron .",
    "so the electron - spinon joint excitation energy is raised to above @xmath441 , i.e. the joint gap is enlarged to @xmath442 , as in fig.[fig : sfdfmap](c ) .",
    "so the itinerant electron pairing would enlarge the hump - dip feature in the sts spectrum .    to verify this , we take @xmath443mev ( pairing gap ) of @xmath36 symmetry , and modify the itinerant electron propagator to @xmath444 . re - calculate the composite fermion self - energy @xmath421 according to eq .",
    ", whose spectral function @xmath445 is shown in fig.[fig : sfdfmap](c ) .",
    "substitute @xmath421 into eq .",
    ", we can obtain the spectrum of the composite fermion in the sc phase , as fig.[fig : sfdfmap](d ) .",
    "the composite modes appear at the edge of the joint gap , as indicated by the arrows .    , and the red vertical line marks the position of the composite mode @xmath442 .",
    "the calculation was done with @xmath290mev , @xmath320mev at @xmath446k . ]    because both the itinerant electron and the composite fermion mode can conduct electric current , the stm differential conductance is a sum of both contributions , as shown by the solid curve in fig.[fig : twogap ] . here",
    "the itinerant electron contribution is shown as the dotted curve , which exhibits the @xmath447 symmetric pairing gap around the fermi surface ( a sudden drop at + 10mev is due to the @xmath28 band top , which is not a universal feature ) . while the dashed curve is the contribution of the composite fermion , which displays the asymmetric hump - dip feature with resonance composite modes at the gap edges .",
    "putting two contributions together , we arrive at the two - gap feature in the sts spectrum , which contains two extra little peaks outside the sc coherence peaks .",
    "the extra peaks from the composite fermion modes has been observed in the recent experiment.@xcite    now we consider the response of the composite fermion mode to the external magnetic field .",
    "first of all , the composite fermion spin can be either in a triplet state or in a singlet state .",
    "for the spin - triplet composite fermion , its energy level will zeeman split in the external magnetic field .",
    "for the spin - singlet composite fermion , its weight will be suppressed by the magnetic field , because the zeeman splitting of the spinon spectrum will reduce and smear out the spinon gap , such that the electron - spinon continuum could expand toward the fermi level and damp out the composite fermion .",
    "therefore we predict that with the external magnetic field , the hump - dip structure in the sts spectrum will be weaken , and the extra peaks observed in the sc phase will split and/or weaken .",
    "admittedly the two - fluid model we have presented here may not be the only theory to explain the observed hump - dip feature and extra peaks in the sts spectrum .",
    "there are still other theoretical possibilities , which we will briefly review / comment as follows .",
    "\\(a ) band structure origin .",
    "this theory explains the sts hump structure by the itinerant electron band structure .",
    "indeed , arpes experiments have commonly observed a shallow flat band 10mev below the fermi level around the @xmath28 point in many iron - based compounds,@xcite which coincides with the hump structure in the energy scale .",
    "but there are several issues .",
    "first , if the hump - dip feature comes from the band structure , it must exhibit rigid band shift under doping , which contradicts with the observation .",
    "second , the sts line shape is particle - hole reversed about the fermi level in the complementary experiments of electron / hole doping , which is hard to explain by the electron band structure .",
    "third , because electron band is a momentum space structure , so its signal should be rather uniform in the real space .",
    "however the observed hump - dip feature is strongly inhomogeneous , which is more likely to originate from some local degrees of freedom .",
    "\\(b ) sdw reentrance.@xcite this theory assumes a second sdw phase in the over - doped region , driven by the nesting of the electron pocket with the second hole pocket , such that the hump - dip feature could be understood as the reentered sdw gap .",
    "however the second sdw phase was not observed yet in the phase diagram .",
    "also the hump - dip feature is observed in both electron and hole doped cases , which is hard to understand if there is only two sdw phases .",
    "moreover this theory also finds difficulties in explaining the asymmetric line shape ( one coherence peak is missing ) .",
    "\\(c ) sc gap features .",
    "based on the eliashberg theory calculation,@xcite the sc gap function @xmath448 has some singularities around the debey frequency @xmath449 , which will be reflected in the sts spectrum @xmath450 , represented as the little peaks / dips outside the sc coherence peak .",
    "this may provide an explanation for the extra peaks observed in the sc phase , but gives no understanding to the hump - dip feature in the normal phase .",
    "\\(d ) inelastic electron tunneling ( iet ) . in the sts experiment ,",
    "if the electron tunnels into the sample with high enough energy , it may excite some gaped bosonic mode and opens a new tunneling channel , causing the differential conductance to jump up .",
    "such a phenomenon is known as the iet,@xcite which may account for the observed hump - dip feature . in the context of iron - based superconductors ,",
    "the relevant bosonic modes include magons , spin - resonance modes , and spinons .",
    "our composite fermion explanation belongs to this picture , that the electron transfers its energy to the spinon to form a composite fermion that carries on the electric current .",
    "it is also possible for the electron to couple with the magon , but the resulting charge carrier would be a magnetic polaron : the collective excitation of electron dressed by a cloud of magnons",
    ". the polaron effect will enhance the electron mass ( like the mass renormalization observed in arpes ) , and cause an accumulation of the electron density of states around the fermi level , which is opposite with the observe hump - dip feature .",
    "another possibility is that the iet energy was transferred to the spin - resonance mode , which is fine for the extra peak in the sc phase , but hard to explain the hump - dip feature that persists into the normal phase .    given the above difficulties in various theoretical scenarios , we conceived the composite fermion picture to understand the unusual experimental observations .",
    "the composite fermion may sounds exotic , but it is indeed a natural consequence that follows from the two - fluid description . admittedly , we still do not have direct evidence for the existence of the deconfined spin - liquid state in the iron - based compounds .",
    "however as a candidate theory , we have shown that the two - fluid description was able to give account for various physics in the sdw , sc and normal phases systematically .",
    "we also proposed that the composite fermion mode can be tested by studying the magnetic field dependence of the hump - dip feature in the normal phase and the extra peak in the sc phase .",
    "more efforts along this direction may help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of iron - based superconductors .",
    "in this work , we proposed the two - fluid description for iron - based superconductors . in this scenario ,",
    "the iron - based sc is understood neither as the weakly correlated bcs theory nor as the strongly correlated rvb theory , but a combination of both physics in some sense : the bcs pairing of itinerant electrons mediated by the fluctuations of the local moment spin - liquid background .",
    "the intermediate correlated electron system in the iron - based compounds contains two effective fluid components : the femi - liquid of itinerant electrons and the spin - liquid of local moments .",
    "the separation of the two - fluid components seems to complicate the problem , but it in fact reduces the difficulty for theoretical handling , because both the fermi - liquid and the spin - liquid physics have been well explored separately , thus the combined description could provide us a more definite starting point to understand intermediate correlated system .",
    "the combination of the two - fluid components is not a simple superposition , as the fermi - liquid and spin - liquid are coupled together via the renormalized hund s rule interaction among the fe @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "the coupling leads to more interesting low - energy collective modes of both fluids , which include the bosonic magnon mode and the composite fermion mode .",
    "these modes are responsible for a series of low - energy phenomena in the iron - based compounds , including the sdw and sc ordering , the spin - resonance , and the hump - dip feature in the normal phase . to some extent , it is these emergent collective modes that constitute the new physics of intermediate correlated system that connect between the weakly or strongly correlated limits .",
    "the two - fluid description assumes that the local moments in the iron - based superconductor are in a spin - liquid state with deconfined spinon excitations . for an isolated spin - liquid ,",
    "the spinons are simply created and annihilated in pairs , driven by the strong quantum fluctuation .",
    "however coupling the spin - liquid to the fermi - liquid allows the spinon to combine with the itinerant electron into the composite fermion , which promotes the spinon creation . in this sense ,",
    "the fractionalization of the local moment is facilitated by its coupling to the itinerant electron , and the formation of composite fermion in turn justifies our initial assumption of the deconfined spin - liquid .",
    "this mechanism of the electron - facilitated fractionalization not only points out a prospective direction to search for spin - liquid states , but also provides a different way to study the spinons : the spinon is now labeled with charge by the attachment of the electron , and the resulting composite fermion mode can be easily probed by the electromagnetic response in various condensed matter experiments .",
    "if this scenario of the two - fluid description was correct , then the significance of the iron - based superconductors would not be limited to the question of high - temperature superconductivity , but could also be extended to the research of spin - liquid by providing new materials and measurements .",

    "in this appendix , we provide the psg classification of bosonic @xmath74 spin - liquid on the square lattice , and then analyze its constraint on the mean - field ansatz .",
    "we start from the symmetry group ( sg ) of the square lattice , which is generated by the following operations : the translation along @xmath82-direction @xmath451 , the translation along @xmath83-direction @xmath452 , the reflection about @xmath82-axis @xmath453 , the reflection about the diagonal @xmath454 . here",
    "@xmath455 label the lattice coordinates . for feas / fese layer in the iron - based compound , because of the alternating arrangement of the as / se atoms outside the fe - plane ,",
    "the operations @xmath456 , @xmath457 and @xmath458 are actually implicitly followed by a mirror reflection about the fe - plane .",
    "the symmetry group generators satisfies the following definition relations : @xmath459 , @xmath460 , @xmath461 , @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath464 .    under the action of @xmath465sg",
    ", the spinon @xmath466 is transformed as @xmath467 , which contains a coordinate transform @xmath468 followed by a gauge transform @xmath469 in the u(1 ) gauge group of the bosonic spinon .",
    "for @xmath74 spin - liquid , the invariant gauge group ( igg ) is the @xmath74 group . to represent the definition relations",
    ", we introduce @xmath74 variables @xmath470 ( for @xmath471 ) , then the algebraic psg equations are @xmath472 one set of gauge inequivalent solutions of the above equations is given as follows @xmath473 the solutions are classified by 5 indices @xmath474 , which leads to totally @xmath475 classes of algebraic psg s .",
    "now we wish to find the mean - field ansatz for the symmetric spin - liquid close to the @xmath126 ordering .",
    "the ordering favors the nearest neighboring ( nn ) hopping @xmath88 and the next nearest neighboring ( nnn ) pairing @xmath76 .",
    "however in the presence of both @xmath88 and @xmath76 , the nn pairing @xmath476 would also be induced .",
    "so we seek for a psg that allows simultaneous presence of @xmath88 , @xmath476 and @xmath76 .",
    "first consider the presence of nnn pairing @xmath76 between the sites ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) .",
    "the bound direction gets reversed under @xmath477 , so we must have @xmath478 under the psg action .",
    "given the solution in eq . , we find @xmath479 under the psg action of @xmath477 , thus @xmath480 .",
    "moreover , the operation @xmath481 leaves the diagonal bound unchanged , while under the corresponding psg action , @xmath482 according to eq .",
    ", so we must have @xmath483 , which leads to @xmath484 . now consider the presence of nn hopping @xmath88 between the sites ( 0,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) .",
    "the bound direction gets reversed under @xmath485 , while the corresponding psg action takes @xmath486 , so we must have @xmath487 . on the other hand , the operation @xmath488 leaves the vertical bound unchanged , while under the corresponding psg action , @xmath489 , thus we must have @xmath490 , from which @xmath491 . at last",
    ", we consider the presence of nn pairing @xmath476 between the sites ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,0 ) . under the psg action of @xmath485 : @xmath492 , while the bound direction is reversed , so we must have @xmath493 .",
    "also , under the psg action of @xmath488 , @xmath494 , while the bound is untouched , so we must have @xmath495",
    ". given @xmath491 , we have @xmath496 . then according to @xmath493 , we conclude @xmath497 .",
    "so the equation @xmath498 requires nn hoping to be pure imaginary . in conclusion ,",
    "the only psg that allows simultaneous presence of nn hoping and pairing , and nnn pairing is as follows @xmath499 this psg also requires the nn hoping to be pure imaginary , which may be re - parameterized by @xmath75 ( such that @xmath500 ) .",
    "we may also set @xmath85 . then use the psg given in eq . to send the mean - field parameters to all bounds in the lattice ,",
    "the eventual result is given in eq .."
