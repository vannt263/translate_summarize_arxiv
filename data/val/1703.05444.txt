    "opinion dynamics have a long history and have been studied extensively in social sciences . probably the most well - known model for opinion dynamics",
    "is the classical degroot model @xcite .",
    "various models have been proposed for opinion dynamics to understand how an individual s opinion evolves over time , including the friedkin - johnsen model @xcite , the hegselmann - krause model @xcite , the degroot - friedkin model @xcite , and the altafini model @xcite . however , there is few work concerning the self - confidence levels of the individuals in a social network .",
    "recently , a new model , called the degroot - friedkin model , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model considers the situation when a group of individuals discusses a sequence of issues , and studies the evolution of the self - confidence levels of individuals ( i.e. , how confident an individual is for her opinions on the sequence of issues ) via the reflected appraisal mechanism proposed in @xcite . lately , a modified degroot - friedkin model has been proposed in @xcite which provides a time - efficient , distributed implementation of the original degroot - friedkin model .",
    "the model has been studied in @xcite with a fixed doubly stochastic relative interaction matrix , and in @xcite with time - varying doubly stochastic relative interaction matrices , while the analysis of the modified degroot - friedkin model with a fixed stochastic ( not doubly stochastic ) relative interaction matrix still remains open .",
    "both the degroot - friedkin model and the modified degroot - friedkin model are described in discrete times .",
    "sometimes a continuous - time model would be a natural choice especially when the opinions of individuals evolve gradually over time ; see for example @xcite .",
    "recently , a continuous - time distributed self - appraisal model has been proposed in @xcite , which shows that when the relative interaction matrix is fixed and there is no `` dominant neighbor '' in the network , the social - confidence levels of the individuals will asymptotically converge to a steady state , depending on the relative interaction matrix , under appropriate connectivity assumption .",
    "local exponential stability of the steady state was shown by checking the jacobian matrix . but no convergence rate result was obtained .",
    "analysis of the continuous - time distributed self - appraisal model for the case of general stochastic relative interaction matrix ( i.e. , without the assumption of no `` dominant neighbor '' ) also remains open .    in a realistic social network ,",
    "the interaction among the individuals may change from time to time . with this in mind",
    ", this paper aims to study the continuous - time distributed self - appraisal model with time - varying interactions which are described by a sequence of time - dependent relative interaction matrices , and specifically derive a convergence rate of the model .",
    "we first construct a simple example to show that the model may not converge for general time - varying stochastic ( not doubly stochastic ) relative interaction matrices . with this observation in mind ,",
    "we focus our attention on the case when the relative interaction matrices are doubly stochastic , and show that the self - appraisals of the individuals all converge to @xmath2 exponentially fast , where @xmath0 is the number of individuals in a network , and obtain an explicit expression of the convergence rate . although doubly stochastic relative interaction matrices may be artificial , this case has an important social meaning as it explains how a democratic state is formed in a social network @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to provide an explicit expression of the convergence rate of the continuous - time distributed self - appraisal model @xcite with time - varying doubly stochastic relative interaction matrices .",
    "we extend the result in @xcite in three - fold .",
    "first , our result implies that the model converges for all fixed doubly stochastic relative interaction matrices , whereas the result in @xcite does not subsume this implication because not all doubly stochastic matrices satisfy the no `` dominant neighbor '' assumption .",
    "second , we show that the convergence is exponentially fast for doubly stochastic relative interaction matrices , whereas only asymptotic convergence was proved in @xcite .",
    "lastly , we show that exponential convergence holds for time - varying doubly stochastic relative interaction matrices and obtain an explicit expression of the convergence rate , which was not considered in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some notations are introduced in section [ notation ] . in section [ model ] , the continuous - time self - appraisal model is introduced . in section [ motivating ] , an example is presented to motivate the assumptions .",

    "let @xmath21 denote the largest integer that is no larger than @xmath22 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the continuous - time distributed self - appraisal model proposed in @xcite .    consider a network consisting of @xmath23 individuals with the constraint that each individual can communicate only with certain other individuals called `` neighbors '' .",
    "the neighbor relationships among the @xmath0 individuals are described by a time - dependent , @xmath0-vertex , directed graph @xmath24 whose vertices correspond to individuals and whose arcs depict neighbor relationships .",
    "specifically , we say that individual @xmath25 is an _ outgoing neighbor _ of individual @xmath10 at time @xmath26 if there is an arc from vertex @xmath10 to vertex @xmath25 in @xmath24 , and say that individual @xmath27 is an _ incoming neighbor _ of individual @xmath10 at time @xmath26 if there is an arc from vertex @xmath27 to vertex @xmath10 in @xmath24 .",
    "we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 to denote the sets of incoming and outgoing neighbors of individual @xmath10 at time @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "the larger @xmath30 is , the more confident is individual @xmath10 .",
    "the continuous - time distributed self - appraisal model is as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the _ relative inter - personal weight _",

    "let @xmath37 for all pairs of @xmath10 and @xmath25 such that @xmath38 .",
    "then , condition implies that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and time @xmath26 , and thus each matrix @xmath41 is a stochastic matrix whose diagonal entries all equal zero .",
    "the matrix @xmath42 is called the _ relative interaction matrix _",
    "@xcite at time @xmath26 .    at initial time",
    "@xmath43 , the self - appraisals are scaled so that they sum to one , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "it will be shown that this initial condition guarantees that @xmath45 for all time @xmath46",
    ".    system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) with a fixed relative interaction ( i.e. , @xmath47 for all time @xmath26 ) was proposed and studied in @xcite .",
    "the system can be viewed as a continuous - time version of the modified degroot - friedkin model studied in @xcite .",
    "@xmath48    to help readers to grasp the social meaning of the model and understand the motivations , we give a brief interpretation of the model below .",
    "see @xcite for detailed explanation .",
    "we begin with the following continuous - time opinion dynamics : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a real number representing the opinion of individual @xmath10 on an issue of interest at time @xmath26 .",
    "note that system is a continuous - time consensus process @xcite with the dynamics of @xmath50 scaled by the nonnegative factor @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 can be viewed as a measure of the total amount of opinions individual @xmath10 accepts from others at time @xmath26 , and @xmath52 can be regarded as the corresponding portion individual @xmath10 accepts from neighbor @xmath25 , which is consistent with the social meaning of @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath30 is the self - appraisal of individual @xmath10 measuring how confident she is on her current opinion .",
    "we now turn to the justification of the model . from , the dynamics of @xmath30 is determined by two terms : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we consider the latter first .",
    "recall that @xmath55 measures the amount of opinion individual @xmath25 accepts from neighbor @xmath10 in the opinion dynamics and @xmath56 is the self - appraisal of individual @xmath25 reflecting the importance of individual @xmath25 in the network .",
    "product @xmath57 can then be viewed as the measure of importance of individual @xmath10 to individual @xmath25 , and thus @xmath54 can be viewed as the measure of importance of individual @xmath10 to the others in the network .",
    "we then consider the other term @xmath53 . in view of condition ( [ eq : c2 ] ) , it follows that @xmath58 thus , @xmath53 can be interpreted as the measure of importance of others to individual @xmath10 .    from the preceding discussion ,",
    "the model ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) is designed for each individual to calculate , in a distributed manner , the difference between her level of importance to others and others level of importance to her .",
    "note that any equilibrium state of system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) is a state when the difference equals zero for each individual .",
    "therefore , the distributed self - appraisal model ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) aims to drive all individuals differences to zero .    to proceed , let @xmath59^\\top$ ] and @xmath60 .",
    "then , system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) can be written in the form of an @xmath0-dimensional state equation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 . throughout the paper , we assume that @xmath42 is piecewise constant",
    ", i.e. , there exists an infinite time sequence @xmath63 with @xmath64 such that @xmath65 then , system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath66 or in a compact form @xmath67 for @xmath68 let @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 is a positive number called a dwell time .",
    "since the matrix @xmath42 is stochastic , it can be verified that @xmath71=0.$ ] the fact that @xmath5 is positive invariant as will be proved in lemma [ lm:5 ] later implies @xmath72 and thus it follows that @xmath73 is a laplacian matrix @xcite for any @xmath74 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath75 is not necessarily a laplacian matrix even if @xmath42 is doubly stochastic .",
    "the difference between system ( [ eq : sys2 ] ) and the continuous - time consensus algorithm @xmath76 is that @xmath73 is a state - dependent laplacian matrix , thus resulting in a nonlinear system , while the laplacian matrix @xmath77 is not state - dependent .",
    "the derived convergence results for the consensus system are typically based on assumptions on the elements of the laplacian matrix such as @xmath78\\cup\\{0\\},$ ] for @xmath74 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are positive constants @xcite .",
    "while system ( [ eq : sys2 ] ) involves a state - dependent matrix @xmath75 and so does ( [ eq : sys4 ] ) .",
    "whether the condition that the boundedness of the nonzero off - diagonal elements of @xmath81 from below for all time @xmath74 is satisfied or not is unknown and hard to check .",
    "thus , those existing results of continuous - time consensus processes @xcite can not be applied here .",
    "although there are some convergence results for opinion dynamics models with state - dependent connectivity and for consensus systems with cut - balanced properties available in the literature @xcite , we do not see a way to apply these results and their analysis to system ( [ eq : sys2 ] ) . in this paper , we will resort to an analysis technique ( see section [ analysis ] ) to bound the extreme values of @xmath30 so that the convergence rate can be characterized .",
    "the technique is partially inspired by the work of @xcite as system ( [ eq : sys3 ] ) is transformed to a form of equations ( [ eq : lm6 - 1 ] ) that also appear in the analysis of consensus systems .",
    "@xmath48    in this paper , we will look into the dynamic behavior of system ( [ eq : sys3 ] ) and analyze how the self - appraisals of individuals evolve with time - varying relative interaction matrices . we will focus our attention on the case when @xmath42 is doubly stochastic , because of the motivating example in the next section , and establish an exponential convergence result for the state of system ( [ eq : sys3 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we provide an example to motivate the assumption that @xmath42 is a doubly stochastic matrix for all @xmath26 proposed in the next section .",
    "when @xmath82 is fixed for all @xmath83 , it has been shown in @xcite that system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) converges to an equilibrium other than @xmath84 , for almost all initial conditions in @xmath5 under the constraints that every agent has at least two incoming neighbors and the inter - individual weights @xmath85 are upper bounded by @xmath86 .",
    "however , for a time - varying relative interaction matrix @xmath42 , the convergence of the system can not be guaranteed in general , which is illustrated by the following example .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 for all integers @xmath89 .",
    "then , @xmath90 .",
    "since both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are irreducible , at each time instant @xmath74 the graph is strongly connected .",
    "note that @xmath91 is a doubly stochastic matrix , one knows that system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) with a fixed @xmath93 will converge to @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "@xmath92 is not doubly stochastic and for system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) with a fixed @xmath95 , the state will converge to @xmath96^\\top$ ] . for a random initial condition in @xmath97 ,",
    "when @xmath42 takes the form of ( [ eq : c ] ) , the system state does not converge as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .     switching between a doubly stochastic matrix @xmath91 and a non - doubly stochastic matrix @xmath92.,width=245 ]",
    "the reason can be explained as follows .",
    "the equilibria other than @xmath98 , of system ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) corresponding to @xmath91 and @xmath92 are different .",
    "then , one can imagine that when @xmath42 switches between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the system state will oscillate , since in each switching mode , the state tends to converge to the corresponding equilibrium .",
    "note that when @xmath99 , the system state will converge to @xmath100 as long as @xmath101 is irreducible and doubly stochastic .",
    "this motivates us to focus on the case of doubly stochastic matrices @xmath42 and impose some connectivity conditions to guarantee the convergence of system ( [ eq : sys3 ] ) .",
