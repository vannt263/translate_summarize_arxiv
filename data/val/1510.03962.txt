    "subtle changes in distant galaxy images occur as the light bundles traveling to us are deflected by gravitational lensing effects due to intervening large scale structures .",
    "precision measurement of these subtle changes , often called  cosmic shear \" , provides a powerful method to probe the statistical properties of the large scale structures , which are in turn the results determined by the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "cosmic shear is sensitive to both the geometry of the universe and the growth of its structure , making it one of the most efficient tools for constraining dark energy ( albrecht et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "as both cosmic geometry and structure evolve with time , we want to measure the cosmic shear statistics at multiple redshifts .",
    "this tomographic analysis becomes possible if a survey can access high - redshift galaxies with low surface brightness limits .",
    "therefore , when designing a cosmic shear survey , given a fixed amount of telescope time , one faces a critical decision regarding the balance between area and depth .",
    "the deep lens survey ( dls ) is a 20 sq .",
    "deg cosmic shear survey with an emphasis on depth reaching @xmath13 mag in @xmath14 at the 5@xmath15 level , and uniformly good image quality .",
    "the images were taken over @xmath16 nights on noao s blanco and mayall 4-meter telescopes . if the same telescope time had been used to cover a 150 sq .",
    "deg instead , the corresponding limiting magnitude would have been @xmath17 mag , which is similar to the expected final depth of the on - going dark energy survey ( des ) or the mean depth of the canada - france - hawaii - telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens ; erben et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "this deliberate choice of  depth over area \" was made after considering the following five issues .",
    "first , it enables us to obtain a longer redshift baseline to break parameter degeneracies .",
    "for example , shallower surveys with wider area are not efficient in shrinking the length of the  banana \" in the @xmath18 plane because of the @xmath19 degeneracy .",
    "second , it compensates for the loss of volume due to a reduced area by extending the volume along the line of sight .",
    "an important source of statistical uncertainty in the existing moderate - scale ( @xmath20 sq .",
    "deg ) cosmic shear surveys is the sample variance due to a limited volume .",
    "a common misconception is that a wide survey contains a much higher volume than a deep survey with a smaller area , but this ignores the volume extension along the line of sight in a deep survey . as an illustration ,",
    "we can consider two surveys with a mean source redshift of z=0.7 and 1.1 .",
    "the difference in co - moving volume ( bounded by the mean source redshift ) is nearly a factor of 3 .",
    "third , it boosts the amplitude of the cosmic shear signals due to the varying strength of the lensing kernel .",
    "given the same lens mass , the strength of lensing signals is a simple function of the two distances : observer - to - lens versus lens - to - source .",
    "for example , when a lens is at @xmath21 , the shear at @xmath22 is nearly twice that at @xmath23 , leading to a factor of 4 difference in correlation function amplitudes .",
    "thus , a deep survey can take advantage of the geometric effect of gravitational lensing more efficiently .",
    "fourth , deep surveys provide more galaxies per area .",
    "we should clarify that this merit does not entirely overlap with the first point .",
    "in addition to new sources at higher redshift , the increased limiting magnitude allows us to detect fainter galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "needless to say , the increased source density reduces shape noise caused by intrinsic ellipticity dispersion .",
    "fifth , it mitigates the effects of intrinsic alignments .",
    "intrinsic alignments of galaxies can be an important theoretical systematic in precision cosmic shear .",
    "current studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that their effects are dominated by luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) . because a deep survey can access fainter galaxies , the fraction of the lrgs decreases as we increase the limiting magnitude . following the approach of",
    ", we estimate that at @xmath21 the amplitude of the ia power spectrum is reduced by a factor of two as we increase the limiting magnitude from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "these considerations drove the cadence and survey details of the dls .    of course , there are a few potential downsides in deep imaging cosmic shear surveys .",
    "if one chooses a small contiguous field , the increase of noise from the cosmic variance can offset the merits mentioned above . in dls , we tried to reduce the cosmic variance by choosing the five 4 sq .",
    "deg fields widely separated .",
    "another issue is object blending . with ground - based seeing , going fainter than @xmath26 mag results in a non - negligible increase in the number of projected overlapping galaxies .",
    "we designed the dls to reach  27 mag at the five sigma level to mitigate the issue .    galaxy shear estimation and control of psf systematics is crucial .",
    "the methods developed for the dls are discussed below .",
    "the natural first step in a cosmic shear analysis of survey data is a simple two - dimensional ( 2d ) , non - tomographic study , including various null tests for shear systematics . in jee",
    "et al . ( 2013 ) [ hereafter j13 ] , we presented our 2d analysis of the dls cosmic shear .",
    "that study shows that the shear systematics are controlled to well below the statistical uncertainties based on residual point - spread - function ( psf ) correlations , b - mode statistics , and star - galaxy correlations .",
    "we also demonstrated that , when combined with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , the dls cosmic shear can put tight constraints on the two parameters : matter density @xmath27 and normalization @xmath28 . combined with the 7-year result of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap7 ; komatsu et al .",
    "2010 ) , the dls 2d study provides @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which reduces the wmap7-only uncertainties by @xmath31% and @xmath32% , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we present full cosmological parameter constraints from the dls tomography , combining three other cosmological probes .",
    "specifically , we choose the 9-year result of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap9 ; hinshaw et al .",
    "2013 ) for cmb data . although selecting the planck cmb results ( planck collaboration et al . 2015",
    "; hereafter planck2015-cmb ) instead of wmap9 leads to smaller parameter uncertainties , we make the above decision because using wmap9 as an external data set provides an interesting opportunity to compare the final results against the planck2015-cmb results , which by themselves produce considerably tight constraints and are reported to be in tension with some cosmology studies ( e.g. , maccrann et al . 2015 ) . for supernova data , we utilize the publicly available union2.1 compilation provided by suzuki et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . for baryonic acoustic oscillation data , we select the results from the following four studies : beutler et al . (",
    "2011 ) , padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , anderson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and blake et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "joint probes are critical in constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "first of all , they enable the diagnosis and mitigation of systematics . because each cosmological probe is subject to different bias arising from both theoretical and instrumental systematics , combining multiple probes",
    "can turn these systematic errors into statistical errors .",
    "second , joint probes are required to break parameter degeneracies .",
    "for example , the degeneracy direction of the @xmath27 versus @xmath28 combination in cosmic shear studies is nearly perpendicular to that in cmb studies .",
    "third , some cosmological parameters are inaccessible in one type of probe .",
    "for example , the @xmath28 parameter is not constrained in probes using purely geometric effects such as supernovae and baos .",
    "the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath10 affects both geometry and growth , but it has a minimal effect on the features in the early universe ( at the last scattering surface ) probed by cmb missions .",
    "we present our tomographic cosmic shear results as follows . in [ section_dls ]",
    "we describe the dls data and the shear estimation algorithm .",
    "a brief review on theoretical formalism regarding cosmic shear tomography and intrinsic alignments is given in [ section_theory ] .",
    "[ section_analysis ] describes the tomography setup and discusses the basic auto- and cross - correlation functions .",
    "we present full cosmological parameter constraints in [ section_parameters ] .",
    "the impact of intrinsic alignments on parameter constraints and comparisons with other cosmological probes are discussed in [ section_discussion ] before we conclude in [ section_conclusion ] .",
    "the dls is designed as a pre - cursor large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) survey with an emphasis on depth reaching a 5@xmath15 limiting magnitude of @xmath13 mag in @xmath14 .",
    "the survey covers five 2@xmath33 fields ( hereafter f1-f5 ) .",
    "two fields ( f1 and f2 ) are in the northern sky and were observed with the kitt peak mayall 4 m telescope / mosaic prime - focus imager ( muller et al . 1998 ) . the rest ( f3 , f4 , and f5 ) are in the southern sky , using the cerro tololo blanco 4 m telescope / mosaic prime - focus imager .",
    "the dls data consist of a total of 140 nights of _ b , v , r , _ and _ z _ imaging . priority was given to the _ r _ filter , where we measure our lensing signal , whenever the seeing was better than @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the survey depth and resolution were designed to minimize point spread function ( psf ) systematics . the @xmath14-band survey depth ( limiting magnitude )",
    "was set based on our image simulation result , which shows that the removal of the psf effect in shape measurement through forward - modeling improves at faint limiting magnitude and remains stable down to @xmath35 .",
    "the mean cumulative exposure time in @xmath14 is @xmath36 s per field whereas it is about 12,000 s per field for each of the rest of the filters .",
    "the approximate resulting limiting magnitudes ( at the @xmath1 level ) are 26 , 26 , 27 , 26 in _ b , v , r , _ and _",
    "z_. our conservative selection scheme provides reliable galaxy shapes down to @xmath37 with a mean redshift of @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting raw number density is @xmath39 per sq .",
    "when galaxies are weighted according to their inverse noise variance ( combining both shape dispersion and measurement noise ) , the effective number density of the source population becomes @xmath40 per sq .",
    "arcmin ( equation 7 of jee et al .",
    ".      conventional galaxy shear estimation based purely on galaxy shape and psf shape measurements on co - added image stacks incurs dangerously large psf systematics and associated b - mode .",
    "this is because in general the psf varies smoothly on the individual exposures but not on the stack .",
    "therefore , a high - fidelity psf map must first be obtained from the individual exposures that go into the deep stack , and then the final psf variation on the deep stack must be modelled after carefully taking into account rotations / shifts , flux calibrations , flat - fielding , masks , etc .",
    "we used the principal component analysis method of jee & tyson ( 2011 ) to model the psf and its variation on individual frames .",
    "we stack these psf models at the exposure level and obtain the final high resolution psf models for our co - adds . in j13 , we showed that our residual psf correlation amplitudes are negligible , based on the statistics suggested by rowe ( 2010 ) .",
    "accurate psf modeling is only a necessary condition for precision shear estimation .",
    "there are a number of subtleties in shear estimation that bias the results .",
    "for example , the mismatch between analytic and true profiles in the galaxy surface brightness distribution can certainly lead to non - negligible bias .",
    "this so - called  model - bias \" is expected to increase for deeper surveys , where more high-@xmath41 ( thus more irregular ) galaxies comprise the source population .",
    "also , a nonlinear mapping from pixel noise to parameter uncertainties has been shown to be critical ( e.g. , refregier et al",
    "this so - called noise - bias can lead to shear bias as high as @xmath42 .",
    "imperfect de - blending is receiving growing attention in deep surveys , where a significant fraction of sources overlap with neighboring objects .",
    "recently , based on image simulations , hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found that even in relatively shallow surveys this de - blending bias is still non - negligible .",
    "we agree that their finding is reasonable because the survey depth does not alter the flux ratio between two neighboring objects although the fainter of the two can be missed in source detection procedure in shallow surveys . apart from the aforementioned sources ,",
    "while participating in great3 , we find that many other details such as the size of the postage stamp images ( we refer to this as  truncation bias \" below ) , handling of the central pixel , initial size and ellipticity of the psf , etc .",
    ", will matter in future cosmic shear surveys , whose requirements in shear estimation precision is well below @xmath43% and additive @xmath44 bias parameters , massey et al .",
    "( 2013 ) estimate @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "our principle to address the above issues is statistical shear calibration through high - fidelity image simulations .",
    "this means that we measure shear bias by comparing recovered shears with true values through the procedures closely mimicking the real image analysis .",
    "the primary merit of the approach is that many subtleties are automatically included and thus cancelled .",
    "for example , we do not have to explicitly single out the truncation bias as long as both simulation and real data analysis use the same postage stamp size .",
    "in dls , we measure galaxy shapes by fitting an elliptical gaussian .",
    "one can argue that elliptical gaussian may not be an optimal choice for real galaxies , creating rather large model - bias compared to more sophisticated models such as sersic or double - sersic models . however , sophisticated models give large uncertainties for shape parameters due to many other nuisance parameters , which in turn increase noise bias . therefore ,",
    "currently it is unclear that highly sophisticated galaxy models are indeed superior .",
    "perhaps , one can consider a single sersic model as a reasonable compromise .",
    "in fact , we participated the great3 challenge with the method implementing the sersic galaxy fitting , and the performance turned out to be excellent .",
    "thus , in future studies , it will be a useful exercise to experiment with the method for analyzing dls data , although the task will involves new suites of time - consuming image simulations . in this paper",
    ", we utilize our previous efforts in j13 .",
    "we perform our shear calibration based on our lsst image simulation tools ( jee & tyson 2011 ) , where the ultra deep field ( udf ; beckwith , et al .",
    "2006 ) galaxies are used . although one can separate the aforementioned issues ( model - bias , noise - bias , etc . ) , we choose to investigate only their combined effect and characterize it using a single parameter @xmath14-band magnitude : @xmath47 because we conserve the statistical properties of the galaxies as a function of magnitude in udf ( i.e. , we do not  clone \" faint galaxy images using bright high s / n galaxy images ) , various sources of bias should be taken care of in this step .",
    "for example , both model- and noise - bias should be characterized by the apparent magnitude proxy . also , the effect of decreasing galaxy half light radius with @xmath41-bin relative to the psf is statistically captured .",
    "nevertheless , in future studies , it would be useful to test a calibration model with explicit @xmath41-bin variables including morphology , size , and noise . in our case ,",
    "the calibration parameter @xmath48 is always greater than unity and should be multiplied by our raw ellipticity .",
    "this equation shows that the mean shear is biased low by @xmath49% at @xmath50 , and the bias can rise as high as @xmath51% at the faint end ( @xmath52 ) . in our 2d cosmic shear analysis ( j13 )",
    ", we demonstrated that based on star - galaxy correlations and  b - mode \" analysis , the residual shear systematics are negligible .",
    "the fidelity of the dls shape measurement scheme has been tested in the third gravitational lensing accuracy testing ( great3 ) , and our method ( called sfit ) won the challenge ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "2015 ) .    using eqn  [ eqn_m_gamma ]",
    ", we derive the mean value of @xmath48 separately for each tomographic bin and apply the calibration to shear correlation functions . as was done in j13 , we assume that our shear calibration is uncertain at the 3% level and thus marginalize over this interval in our cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "similar to our handling of photo - z bias , the residual shear bias correlation between different tomographic bins is assumed to be 100% , which is a conservative choice because this perfect positive correlation assumption will maximally degrade the cosmological parameter uncertainties .      in [ section_analysis ] we will describe breaking the galaxy data into tomographic bins using photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath41 s ) . for dls , photo-@xmath41 s are calculated using bpz ( benitez 2000 ) .",
    "schmidt & thorman ( 2013 ) carefully calibrate the priors and  tweak \" the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates utilizing @xmath53 spectroscopic redshifts from the hectospec lensing survey ( shels ; geller et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , it is crucial to verify that the utility of this customization based on the specific sample does not result in overtraining .",
    "schmidt & thorman ( 2013 ) and j13 compared the dls photometric redshifts with the spectroscopic redshifts from the prism multi - object survey ( primus ; coil et al .",
    "2011 ) , an independent survey partially overlapping dls , and demonstrated that the agreement is excellent .    in a galaxy - galaxy lensing study from the dls , choi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) further examined the dls photo-@xmath41 systematics by swapping foreground and background photo - z bins as a null test , and found that the results were consistent with predictions from known systematics .",
    "they also calculated angular cross - correlations @xmath54 between different photo-@xmath41 bins and concluded that the ratios between the auto- and cross - correlations of these samples were less than 0.1 , consistent with the overlap of the @xmath55 tails and the known photo-@xmath41 outlier rates .",
    "in j13 , we demonstrated that the photo - z bias is small ( @xmath56% ) in the low redshift regime ( @xmath57 ) , where many spectroscopic redshifts are available .",
    "it is extremely difficult to estimate the bias in the high ( @xmath58 ) redshift regime where not many spectroscopic redshifts within dls exist .",
    "the role of the used prior might be significant here , as objects with poor sed constraints are likely to default to the prior .",
    "in j13 , we estimated the prior dependence by separately running bpz using the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) prior and comparing the results with the ones obtained with the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ; le fvre et al .",
    "2005 ) prior , which is the main prior employed in dls .",
    "the resulting  3% change in the mean redshift was adopted as the photo - z bias in j13 , and thus the cosmological parameters were obtained after marginalization over the 3% interval .",
    "we believe that this estimate is conservative because the hdfn prior is derived from a single _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ field ( @xmath59 ) , whereas the main vvds prior is obtained from a much larger ( by a factor of @xmath60 ) survey . as was done in j13 , in the current tomographic analysis , we also marginalized over the same 3% bias interval ( flat prior ) in photometric redshift .",
    "we assumed that the photo - z bias parameters in the five bins are 100% correlated , which gives the maximum deviation and is certainly more conservative than the assumption that the correlation is weaker or independent .",

    "many statistics have been suggested to quantify the correlation and draw cosmological information out of the statistics . in this paper",

    "conventionally one of the fundamental posits of weak - lensing is zero or sufficiently small correlation of galaxy shapes in the absence of gravitational lensing ; i.e. intrinsically random galaxy ellipticities .",
    "however , both theory and observation have shown that this assumption is not valid at the level of precision that we soon will achieve . this intrinsic alignment ,",
    "unless carefully addressed , may become a critical factor that limits our interpretation of cosmic shear data from the next generation surveys such as lsst , euclid , wfirst - afta , etc .",
    "a straightforward shape correlation occurs between physically close pairs experiencing the common tidal force from the same environment .",
    "this correlation , often termed  ii \" ( intrinsic - intrinsic ) , is positive on average and hence artificially increases amplitudes of shear - shear correlations ( catelan et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "a less straightforward , but greater systematic error in cosmic shear from intrinsic alignment is a correlation between gravitational shear and intrinsic ellipticity , which is often referred to as  gi \" ( gravitational - intrinsic ) .",
    "this correlation arises because images of background galaxies are sheared by gravitational lensing effects of foreground large scale structures , inside which the galaxies are intrinsically aligned , but are physically at great distances from the background galaxies along the line of sight ( hirata & seljak 2004 ) . since in general lensing efficiency is greater for larger separation between lens and source along the line of sight , this gi systematic is redshift - dependent and becomes substantial when we cross - correlate galaxy shapes with a large difference in redshift .",
    "both ii and gi effects can in principle become more important in tomographic studies than in two - dimensional ones . in tomographic cosmic shear",
    ", there is a higher chance that a chosen galaxy pair is physically close when we evaluate auto - correlation functions because the redshift ranges are narrower .",
    "also , in a tomographic study , gi signals become amplified when we cross - correlate between low - z and high - z bins . in two - dimensional studies ,",
    "these gi and ii pairs are greatly outnumbered by other pairs .",

    "the intrinsic alignment signal from blue galaxies is consistent with zero according to mandelbaum et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who investigate the effect using blue galaxies from the wiggle - z survey .",
    "this significant type - dependence may be utilized to our advantage if we can identify ( utilizing photometric and morphological data ) and remove lrgs from our source population . because lrgs comprise a small fraction , the resulting loss in s / n is not substantial in general .    some have suggested methods that null ia effects .",
    "for example , joachimi & schneider ( 2008 ) proposed a method to down - weight ia systematics utilizing the aforementioned redshift dependence of the gi signals .",
    "however , given the expected photometric redshift uncertainties of near - term surveys , the method likely suffers from a non - negligible loss in s / n , compromising the parameter constraining power of the cosmic shear surveys .",
    "another solution to address ia systematics is to model the amplitude of the systematic and remove it from observed signals .",

    "we display the results in figure  [ fig_impact_of_ia ] .",
    "the comparison shows that the five cases produce consistent results , although we note that different ia schemes move the location of the contours along the @xmath378constant degeneracy curve .",
    "this is somewhat expected because in general ia signals are an order of magnitude smaller than cosmic shear signals ( figure  [ fig_xi_p_all ] ) and thus do not greatly affect the amplitude of the combination @xmath208 .",
    "the shifts along the @xmath378constant degeneracy for different ia schemes are also found in heymans et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    in our study , it is difficult to find a trend in the relation between the ia scheme and the direction of the shift .",
    "for example , the @xmath375 case favors a combination of high @xmath27 and low @xmath28 values with respect to the case where we completely ignore ia correction . if this trend continues , increasing the strength of ia by a factor of two ( i.e. , @xmath376 ) may shift the center of the contour further lower right .",
    "our experiment shows that the direction of the shift is reversed in the @xmath376 case , and the result favors a combination of low @xmath27 and low @xmath28 with respect to the non - ia case .",

    "the luminosity - dependent ia correction affects the @xmath27-@xmath28 constraint only slightly with respect to the baseline ( non - ia correction ) case .",

    "for example , at @xmath380 , @xmath381 , which makes the gi power spectrum @xmath113 low despite the high value of @xmath382 . nevertheless , it is non - trivial to predict the direction of the shift , as the exact value of the @xmath379 term depends on the source luminosity ( redshift ) .",
    "one of the important lessons from the current experiment is that our inability to model the ia contributions prefectly will have only negligible impact on our cosmological parameter constraints when the dls cosmic shear is combined with other probes .      as mentioned in [ section_measurement ] , we present the results using our cosmic shear measurements at @xmath383 to mitigate the baryonic effect . until a quantitative consensus becomes available , this passive measure is inevitable for dls .",

    "in addition to the baryonic effect , signals at small scales are also sensitive to other systematic effects such as non - linear power spectrum , reduced shear , cosmology - dependent covariance , etc .",
    "if the combined effect is large , we may be able to detect it through iteration with varying cutoff angles , below which the signals are discarded .",
    "we experiment with different cutoff angles and display the results in figure  [ fig_cutoff ] .",

    "the three open circles represent the results when we applied larger cutoff angles for @xmath82 ; that is , @xmath386(0.4@xmath385 , 4.1@xmath385 ) , ( 1.3@xmath385 , 13.1@xmath385 ) , and ( 4.1@xmath385,23.4@xmath385 ) .",
    "the reason that one may consider larger cutoff angles for @xmath82 is that the @xmath82 signals probe smaller structures than the @xmath81 signals at the same angular separation @xmath63 .",
    "this higher sensitivity of @xmath82 to baryonic effects is demonstrated in detail by the dark energy survey collaboration et al .",

    "in particular , the discrepancy in @xmath82 is shown to be significant , giving a fractional difference of @xmath230% at @xmath387 whereas the discrepancy in @xmath81 is much smaller ( even at @xmath388 the fractional difference is only a few percent ) .",
    "having observed the comparison made in the dark energy survey collaboration et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , one may regard the results as indicating a possibility that the dls signals at small angles progressively favor a low normalization perhaps due to the baryonic effect .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the six data points in figure  [ fig_cutoff ] are still statistically consistent . we believe that even without any scale - dependent systematics , this kind of a weak trend can still be detected via sample variance ( i.e. , our dls fields can happen to contain more large scale structures by chance ) .",
    "therefore , for the current study , we can only conclude that the combined systematic effect ( e.g. , baryons , non - linearity , etc . ) at small angles is not large enough to manifest itself beyond the statistical limits .",
