    "the mott insulator lanthanum titanate ( latio@xmath2 ) is one of the most puzzling materials in the family of transition metals ( tm ) of the perovskite structure ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "each of the ti ions in this material has a single valent electron in one of the three - fold degenerate @xmath1 orbitals , causing the ground state to be enormously degenerate .",
    "whereas in the majority of the tm perovskites the conventional jahn - teller distortion lifts the orbital degeneracy , such distortions are believed to be small in the lanthanum titanate , @xcite and will be assumed to be zero for the purposes of the present paper . here",
    "we pose the following question : is there an alternative mechanism to the jahn - teller one , which is capable of removing the orbital degeneracy ?    this question has already come up in materials with doubly - degenerate @xmath3 valent electrons . in these materials",
    ", there exists an _ orbitally ordered phase _",
    ", with coherent excitations ( ` orbitons ' ) .",
    "@xcite these excitations were recently observed in lamno@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the notion of an orbital disordered , _ liquid _ , state was developed in ref .",
    "for the hole doped lamno@xmath2 with a high hole concentration , where the antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulating state gives way to a ferromagnetic metallic phase .",
    "theoretically , the orbitons in doped materials are constructed similarly to spinons , which appear within the framework of the @xmath4 model for the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "@xcite another scenario of quantum liquid formation was proposed for the insulating kcuf@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite according to ref .",
    ", the orbital fluctuations ( random changes of the bond directions ) may be the source for the  quantum melting \" of the magnetic order , because of the strong interaction between orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "melting , in this scenario , means the disappearance of a long - range af order in favor of a _ spin liquid _ state .",
    "the lifting of the degeneracy of the @xmath1 orbital triplet in latio@xmath2 is a more difficult problem . in this case , according to the analysis of kugel and khomskii ( kk ) , @xcite the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom are not separated .",
    "hence , the spin excitations are necessarily intimately involved in the formation of the orbital excitations and _ vice versa_. a possible scenario of orbital liquid formation in latio@xmath2 has been proposed in ref . .",
    "these authors have conjectured the appearance of a resonance between the spin and the orbital excitations . to describe this resonance , they have used mean - field decoupling , generalizing the approach proposed in ref . for the spin liquid state in the two - dimensional @xmath4 model .",
    "this decoupling leads inevitably to the conclusion that the resonance states should give a contribution linear in the temperature to the low - energy specific heat .",
    "such a sommerfeld - like contribution signals the lifting of the orbital degeneracy by forming a quantum liquid .",
    "unfortunately , a direct experimental check of this prediction in latio@xmath2 has yielded negative results .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , the main idea of khaliullin and maekawa @xcite is rehabilitated by means of a more refined approach , which goes beyond the mean - field decoupling .",
    "we use the methods recently tested in the theory of kondo lattices , where the spin liquid state is described as short - range correlations of the rvb type , which arise due to a non - local exchange through the kondo screening clouds between the magnetic ions .",
    "@xcite we show that the _ two - magnon _ excitations play a similar role in the formation of the orbital liquid correlations .",
    "our analysis is based on the kk hamiltonian @xcite ( see below ) . in its simplest symmetric form ,",
    "this hamiltonian _ does not _ support long - range magnetic order at any non - zero temperature , due to some hidden symmetries.@xcite however , the hamiltonian of the real latio@xmath2 contains many additional ( possibly small ) terms , which restore long range af spin order below some nel temperature @xmath5 , as indeed observed experimentally.@xcite in the following , we therefore _ assume _ the existence of this ordered magnetic state , and concentrate on its effects on the low temperature dynamics of the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "once the magnetic order is stabilized , we expect these dynamics at temperatures @xmath6 to be described by the kk hamiltonian , as discussed below .",
    "indeed , we find heavily damped orbital excitations , which form a continuum whose energy scale is the same as that of the spin excitations , such that both orbital and spin excitations merge into a common continuum . as a result , a direct experimental observation of the orbital dynamics alone , at low temperatures , is hardly possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the derivation of the kk hamiltonian , and set the basis for our perturbation expansion .",
    "the latter is carried out in sec .",
    "iii , where the orbital spectrum is obtained and discussed .",
    "section iv includes our conclusions .",
    "following the kk approach , @xcite we consider a simplified version of the titanate , concentrating only on the sublattice of ti ions .",
    "each ti ion possesses a single electron in one of the three - fold degenerate @xmath1 orbitals of the @xmath7-shell . including only a single coulomb - hubbard on - site repulsion on the ti ion , with energy @xmath8 , the simple initial hamiltonian reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "here , @xmath11 creates an electron of spin @xmath12 at site @xmath13 , in one of the @xmath1 levels , denoted @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number operator in the @xmath14 orbital on site @xmath13 with spin index @xmath12 .",
    "kugel and khomskii @xcite treated this hamiltonian in second - order perturbation theory , assuming that the overlap integrals @xmath16 are much smaller than @xmath8 , in order to obtain an effective hamiltonian describing the spin interactions among the ti ions .",
    "operating within strictly cubic symmetry , kk assumed that @xmath17 where @xmath18 and differs from zero only when @xmath19 the resulting exchange hamiltonian , for a bond along the @xmath20-direction , reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spin operator on site @xmath13 , and @xmath23 sets the energy scale of the spin excitations .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom are now described by the operators @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , which create a spinless fermion ( termed ` orbiton ' ) in the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) orbital on site @xmath13 .",
    "the intermingling of the orbiton degrees of freedom with those of the spin is contained in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) , in which kk introduced the orbiton operator product @xmath30 , given by @xmath31 the expressions for @xmath32 ( for bonds along the @xmath33-direction ) and for @xmath34 ( for bonds along the @xmath35-direction ) are derived from eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) by cyclic permutations of the operators @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the full exchange hamiltonian is the sum of the three , @xmath39 then , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) , when added together with the corresponding terms in @xmath40 and @xmath41 yields twice the total number of electrons in the system , @xmath42 which is just a constant .",
    "contrary to the situation in the manganites , the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the titanate are not separated . moreover",
    ", the orbiton - spin interaction has a peculiar structure of two fermions interacting with one magnon ( see below ) . to explore the outcome of this complicated situation , we proceed as follows .",
    "firstly , we work well below t@xmath43 .",
    "then the spin operators may be treated by the linearized holstein - primakoff transformation : assuming a two sublattice bipartite antiferromagnetic order , with moments along the magnetic @xmath20-direction , we write @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is a boson operator which creates a magnon excitation ( related to @xmath46 ) . secondly , the kk exchange hamiltonian , together with eq .",
    "( [ xx ] ) , will be treated as a perturbation , acting on the zeroth order hamiltonian .",
    "the latter consists of the free orbiton hamiltonian , and the free spin hamiltonian . for the first",
    ", we impose a constraint ensuring that each site is occupied by a single charge carrier .",
    "this constraint is applied _",
    "globally_. for the latter , we introduce an infinitesimally small staggered magnetic field in the magnetic @xmath20-direction , @xmath47 . hence , @xmath48 with @xmath49 note that the chemical potential @xmath50 includes the constant term of the original kk hamiltonian ( [ fullh ] ) [ _ cf_. eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) ] . in the next section we use these definitions in order to construct a thermodynamic perturbation theory in terms of the matsubara green functions .",
    "the orbiton spectrum is determined by the self - energy of the orbiton green function . here",
    "we calculate the orbiton green function , which is diagonal in the orbiton operators , that is , @xmath51 where @xmath13 and @xmath52 denote lattice sites , @xmath53 is the time - ordering operator , and @xmath54 or @xmath38 .",
    "this green function satisfies the dyson equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ` bare ' orbiton green function , @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the matsubara frequency .",
    "as we show below , the self - consistent calculation of the orbiton self - energy , @xmath59 , requires knowledge of the magnon green function , which may be represented by the matrix @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unlike the standard case of a linear fermion - boson interaction , the kk hamiltonian ( [ fullh ] ) contains six - tail interaction vertices , of four types ( see fig .",
    "these are denoted @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and are given by @xmath65 @xmath62 has the same form as @xmath61 with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "hence the kk hamiltonian involves a fermion - magnon interaction , which is _ quadratic _ in the magnon operators and _ quartic _ in the fermion operators .",
    "this feature is the basis for our results in the following .",
    "= 8truecm      to first order , the perturbation expansion corresponds to the mean - field approximation for the self - energy of both the orbitons and the magnons .",
    "then , these self - energies can be obtained by decoupling the product of magnon operators and orbiton operators appearing , e.g , in eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) .",
    "this procedure is carried out as follows . ignoring a constant",

    "( [ y ] ) and ( [ xx ] ) , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath71 stands for the thermodynamic average of the relevant operators .",
    "a similar decoupling is written down for @xmath72 and @xmath73 . when these three approximate hamiltonians are summed together",
    ", the resulting hamiltonian separates into two terms , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the first pertaining to the magnons , and the second to the orbitons .",
    "let us first consider @xmath74 and the magnon dynamics it implies .",
    "the orbiton operator product contained in @xmath76 is further decoupled , by introducing the thermal averages , which will be determined self - consistently ( see below ) , @xmath77 in other words , we assume an equal average occupation of all three orbitals ( i.e. , no orbital long range order ) , and consider only the possible  ordering \" of the off - diagonal orbital parameter , @xmath78 , which represents the delocalization of the orbital degrees of freedom",
    ". then @xmath74 takes the form @xmath79 with the coupling constant @xmath80 thus , @xmath81 reduces to the usual spin - wave antiferromagnetic hamiltonian , with a renormalized exchange coefficient . as usual",
    ", this hamiltonian is diagonalized in fourier space , utilizing the holstein - primakoff rotation : @xmath82 where @xmath83 such that @xmath84 hence , the magnon green function takes the form @xmath85 with the magnon frequency @xmath86    within the mean field approximation of eq .",

    "since the operator @xmath91 still involves products of four operators , one needs to apply further contractions .",
    "it is then convenient to calculate the orbiton self - energy using the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . from these diagrams",
    "one finds the first order self - energy @xmath92 , \\label{self}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the form factors @xmath93 and analogous expressions for @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",

    "moreover , this band - width is temperature - dependent , due to the temperature dependence of the magnon occupations , contained in @xmath88 , eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) , and due to the temperature dependence of @xmath78 itself . for a given wave - vector @xmath102 ,",
    "the three energies @xmath103 are generally different , so that the degeneracy of the @xmath1 band is removed .",
    "indeed , were we to terminate the calculation at this level , keeping only first - order contributions , then the orbiton averages , eqs .",
    "( [ ndelta ] ) , would have to be found self - consistently using the green function ( [ g1 ] ) .",
    "it is very illuminating to examine those self - consistency requirements .",
    "equation ( [ g1 ] ) yields @xmath104 then the self - consistency equations read @xmath105 where the first equation fixes the chemical potential @xmath106 , so that the three - fold - degenerate orbiton band is 1/3 filled , and the second determines @xmath78 .",
    "evidently , eqs .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) are satisfied by setting @xmath107 , ( since then the fermi function is independent of * k * , and @xmath108 vanishes ) .",
    "let us now examine at which temperature @xmath100 begins to deviate from zero . to this end",
    "we expand eqs .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) in powers of @xmath78 . the first self - consistency equation yields ( at @xmath109 ) @xmath110 while the second allows a non - zero @xmath78 only for temperatures lower than the solution of @xmath111 using here the explicit expression for @xmath112 , eq . ( [ x ] ) , and the results eqs .",
    "( [ jtild ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) for the magnon frequency , we find @xmath113 this is an implicit equation for the temperature at which @xmath114 begins to deviate from zero .",
    "examination of this result reveals that this occurs at @xmath115 of order @xmath116 .",
    "a similar order of magnitude is found from the spin - wave approximation for the nel temperature ( above which the staggered magnetization @xmath117 vanishes ) .",
    "both of these estimated temperatures are probably above the real nel temperature , which is determined by small symmetry breaking terms which are not contained in the simple kk model .",
    "hence , in the whole range below the real @xmath5 we expect to have a finite @xmath118 , and we do not expect any phase transition at which @xmath78 vanishes while the spins are still ordered .",
    "even if this statement is not valid for all @xmath119 , we still expect it to hold for sufficiently low temperatures . in the next section",
    "we examine the dynamical corrections to the orbiton spectrum , brought about by the second - order corrections , and examine whether and how the above conclusion is modified .      the next order contribution to the orbiton self - energy , @xmath120 ,",
    "requires expansion to second order in the kk hamiltonian , i.e. to second order in the diagrams listed in fig .",
    "1 . instead of going through the details of all the diagrams which contribute to @xmath121 ,",
    "we give here the details of only two diagrams , which describe orbiton propagation assisted by two - magnon processes ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the first of these two diagrams is generated by the vertices @xmath61 and @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , whereas the second is generated by the vertices @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "both diagrams contain a single propagating fermion line .",
    "each of the other two fermion tails ( of each vertex ) is rolled into a bubble , to give the factor @xmath122 .",
    "other diagrams involve three internal fermion lines , but do not change the qualitative features discussed below .",

    "here we have introduced the magnon coherence factors , @xmath125 which , upon using eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) , take the simpler form @xmath126 with the second - order corrections to the orbiton self - energy , the orbiton green function becomes @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "we now concentrate on the contributions of eqs .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) to this green function .",
    "clearly , these contributions yield a finite , temperature - dependent imaginary part to the orbiton dispersion , namely , the orbiton modes acquire a temperature - dependent damping , as expected .",
    "the new dispersion law is obtained from the poles of the green function ( [ g2 ] ) , @xmath129 where @xmath20 is a complex variable . examining eqs .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) one may draw the following conclusions .",
    "( i ) the real part of the second - order self - energy , @xmath130 , as function of @xmath131 , contains three components which come from the two - magnon processes .",
    "the lowest one arises from the two - magnon emission processes and is dominant in the interval @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the maximal magnon frequency [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) ] . the second results from the processes in which one magnon is emitted and one is absorbed , which occur in the interval @xmath134 .",
    "the third component comes from the two - magnon absorption processes and prevails at positive frequencies , @xmath135 .",
    "it follows that @xmath136 has a significant magnitude in the entire range @xmath137 , and falls down rapidly outside this interval .",
    "the magnitude of different contributions to @xmath138 is regulated by the magnon occupation numbers .",
    "in particular , the mixed emission - absorption processes are frozen out at @xmath139 .",
    "one may conclude that the superposition of the three types of the two - magnon processes results in a complicated behavior of @xmath140 .",
    "this quantity may have several zeros and peaks within the above energy interval ; the heights of these peaks can be estimated as @xmath141 , with a numerical coefficient @xmath142 .",
    "( ii ) the imaginary part of the orbiton self - energy , which comes from the second order terms , @xmath143 , behaves similarly to the real part ; expressions ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) do not show that @xmath144 is essentially smaller than @xmath145 in the whole energy interval .",
    "( iii ) as a result , the orbitons become ill - defined , heavily damped , quasi - particles .",
    "their off - diagonal orbiton parameter @xmath78 , and the related orbiton band - width , should be again determined self - consistently , using the refined orbiton green function eq . ( [ g2 ] ) , @xmath146 in place of the second of eqs .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) .    without going into the details of the solutions of the complicated self - consistent equation for @xmath118 , eq .",
    "( [ self2 ] ) , it is clear that going beyond the simple mean - field calculation changes drastically the nature of the orbiton excitations .",
    "whereas in the first order we have obtained a coherent orbiton spectrum with a well - defined wave vector ( appearing due to the magnetic order ) , this picture changes drastically with the second - order corrections .",
    "the interaction with the spin wave excitations extends the effective width of the orbiton band and makes it asymmetric relative to its center of gravity .",
    "moreover , the orbiton excitations lose their coherence by acquiring a considerable life - time ( given by the imaginary part of the self - energy ) . those excitations are thus transformed into a structureless  liquid - like \" continuum .",
    "clearly , more complicated processes involving higher - orders of the orbiton - magnon interaction , are not expected to modify this picture .",
    "we have proposed in this paper a mechanism capable of lifting the degeneracy of the @xmath1 orbitals in the titanate . in our scenario ,",
    "the orbital degeneracy is removed due to the interplay between the ( ordered ) spin and the ( disordered ) orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we have obtained three dispersive orbiton bands , with a temperature - dependent band - width and a structureless spectrum , that exist together with the coherent spin fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "we have found that the second - order perturbation corrections transform the coherent orbiton spectrum , @xmath147 , [ see eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) ] obtained within the simplest mean - field theory , into an incoherent continuum of heavily damped excitations , which may be termed an ` orbital liquid ' .",
    "this , in turn , may explain the experimental observation , @xcite that the low - temperature heat capacity arises from the spin wave excitations alone .",
    "the incoherent continuum state of the orbital excitations is dominated at low temperatures by the two - magnon emission peak in the orbiton self - energy .",
    "the effect of this peak is to shift the weight of the orbiton spectrum into negative energies , thus making the orbiton liquid state thermodynamically preferable as compared to the fully - degenerate orbiton state that prevails when @xmath109 , or in the absence of the coupling with the spin degrees of freedom . in particular",
    ", our process of degeneracy lifting may possibly overcome the jahn - teller mechanism .",
    "@xcite in the latter , the energy gain is restricted by the energy of the jahn - teller coupling strength , which is definitely smaller than the exchange coupling , which determines the energy gain in our case .",
    "finally we mention that , within the framework of the kk hamiltonian in cubic symmetry , the orbiton - magnon interaction can not lead to a magnetic anisotropy , that is , it can not generate a gap in the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "to obtain such anisotropies , one should extend the kk hamiltonian to include the hybridization of the oxygen and titanium orbitals , the possible orthorhombic tilting of the oxygen octahedra , as well as spin - orbit interactions .",
    "apparently , one will also have to treat the coulomb interaction in a more refined way , taking into account coulomb - exchange effects.@xcite      j. van den brink , g. khaliullin , and d. khomskii , _ orbital effects in manganites _",
