    "the graph @xmath17 provides both a recipe for preparing @xmath13 and a mathematical characterization of @xmath13 .",
    "the recipe for preparing the state is the following .",

    "then , for each edge connecting two qubits , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , apply the controlled-@xmath2 gate between qubits @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.e. , the unitary transformation @xmath21 .",
    "the mathematical characterization of @xmath13 is the following .",

    "it has been shown by van den nest , dehaene , and de moor that for a particular class of qubit graph states local unitary equivalence implies local clifford equivalence @xcite . moreover , numerical results show that local clifford equivalence coincides with local unitary equivalence for qubit graph states associated with connected graphs up to @xmath43 vertices @xcite .",

    ". we will provide a representative with the minimum number of edges for each lc class .",
    "the _ schmidt measure _ was introduced by eisert and briegel as a tool for quantifying the genuine multipartite entanglement of quantum systems @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "any state vector @xmath51 of a composite quantum system with @xmath52 components can be represented as @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , for @xmath57 .",

    "the minimal number of product terms @xmath59 is given by the _",

    "hence , the schmidt measure could be considered a generalization of the schmidt rank to multipartite quantum systems [ see eq .",

    "the schmidt measure can be extended to mixed states by means of a convex roof extension . in this letter , however , we will deal only with pure states .",
    "given a graph @xmath62 , a _ partition _ of @xmath15 is any tuple @xmath63 of disjoint subsets @xmath64 , with @xmath65 . in case @xmath66",
    ", we refer to the partition as a _ bipartition _ , and denote it @xmath67",

    "the partitioning where @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , for every @xmath75 , is referred to as the _ finest partition_.    we must point out that @xmath76 is nonincreasing under a coarse graining of the partitioning : if two components are merged in order to form a new component , then the schmidt measure can only decrease .",
    "if we denote the schmidt measure of a state vector @xmath32 evaluated with respect to a partitioning @xmath69 as @xmath77 , meaning that the respective hilbert spaces are those of the grains of the partitioning , then the nonincreasing property of @xmath76 can be expressed as @xmath78 if @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath67 be a bipartition ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) of a graph @xmath62 , with @xmath81 , and let us denote the adjacency matrix of the graph by @xmath82 , i.e. , the symmetric matrix with elements @xmath83 when we are dealing with a bipartition , it is useful to label the vertices of the graph so that @xmath84 , @xmath85 . then , we can decompose the adjacency matrix @xmath82 into submatrices @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( that represent edges within @xmath88 and edges within @xmath89 ) , and @xmath90 ( the @xmath91 off - diagonal submatrix of the adjacency matrix @xmath82 that represents those edges between @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , @xmath92 the schmidt rank @xmath93 of a graph state @xmath13 represented by the graph @xmath62 , with respect to the bipartition @xmath67 , is given by the binary rank [ i.e. , the rank over @xmath94 of the submatrix @xmath90 , @xmath95 it follows straightforwardly from the definition that @xmath96 , because the different bipartitions are fixed by choosing the smaller part , say @xmath88 , of the bipartition @xmath67 , which gives @xmath97 bipartitions .",
    "while calculating the schmidt rank with respect to all possible bipartitions of a given graph , let us count how many times a certain rank occurs in all the bipartite splits , and then classify this information according to the number of vertices in @xmath88 , the smaller part of the split under consideration .",
    "there is a compact way to express this information , the so - called _ rank indexes _ @xcite .",

    ", we have chosen the one ( or one of those ) with the minimum number of edges and the minimum maximum degree ( i.e. , number of edges incident with a vertex ) .",
    "this means that the graph state associated to this graph requires the minimum number of controlled-@xmath2 gates for its preparation , and the minimum preparation depth ( i.e. , its preparation requires a minimum number of steps ) @xcite .",
    "all the representatives of each of the @xmath1  orbits are illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath47 are in table  [ maintable ] .",
    "it is a well - known fact that for any measure of multiparticle entanglement proposed so far , including the schmidt measure @xmath76 , the computation is exceedingly difficult for general states . in order to determine @xmath76 , one has to show that a given decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ schdec ] ) with @xmath60 terms is minimal . for a general state",
    ", the minimization problem involved can be a very difficult problem of numerical analysis , which scales exponentially in the number of parties @xmath52 as well as in the degree of entanglement of the state itself .",
    "nevertheless , this task becomes feasible if we restrict our attention to graph states .",
    "heb established several upper and lower bounds for the schmidt measure in graph theoretical terms @xcite .",
    "these bounds make possible to determine the schmidt measure for a large number of graphs of practical importance , because in many cases the bounds proposed are easily computable and , remarkably , the upper and lower bounds frequently coincide .      for any graph state @xmath13 , upper bounds for its schmidt measure @xmath104",
    "are the _ pauli persistency _ @xmath105 and the _ size of the minimal vertex cover _ @xmath106 , @xmath107 the pauli persistency is the minimal number of local pauli measurements necessary to disentangle a graph state .",
    "concerning this question , heb described graphical transformation rules when local pauli measurements are applied @xcite .",
    "a vertex cover is a concept from graph theory : it is any subset @xmath108 of vertices in a graph @xmath17 to which _ any _ edge of @xmath17 is incident ( see fig . [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the minimal vertex cover of a graph is the smallest one , whose size is denoted by @xmath106 . according to the graphical rules for the pauli measurements , since each @xmath30 measurement simply deletes all edges incident to a vertex , the size of the minimal vertex cover would equal the pauli persistency , provided that we restrict the pauli measurements to @xmath30 measurements .",
    "nevertheless , in graphs with many edges , i.e. , very connected , a proper combination of @xmath29 , @xmath109 , and @xmath30 measurements could provide a more efficient disentangling sequence , giving a better upper bound @xmath105 for the schmidt measure .",
    "see @xcite for details .      for any graph state",
    "@xmath13 , a lower bound for the schmidt measure @xmath104 is the _ maximal schmidt rank _ , @xmath110 while calculating the schmidt rank with respect to all possible bipartitions of a given graph @xmath62 , if one maximizes the schmidt rank over all bipartitions @xmath67 of the graph , and takes into account the nonincreasing property of @xmath111 [ see eq .",
    "( [ nonincreasing ] ) ] , then one obtains a lower bound for the schmidt measure with respect to the finest partitioning .",
    "this lower bound is the maximal schmidt rank , @xmath112 according to the definition of schmidt rank , the maximal schmidt rank for any state is , at most , @xmath113 , i.e. , the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath114 .      as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ localcomplementation ] , applying the lc - rule does not change the schmidt measure @xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that other local changes to the graph , such as the deletion of edges or vertices , have only a limited effect on @xmath76 .",
    "this fact is established by heb @xcite in what they call the _ edge / vertex rule _ : on one hand , by deleting ( or adding ) an edge @xmath115 between two vertices of a graph @xmath17 the schmidt measure of the resulting graph @xmath116 can at most decrease ( or increase ) by 1 . on the other hand , if a vertex @xmath117 ( including all its incident edges ) is deleted , the schmidt measure of the resulting graph @xmath118 can not increase , and will at most decrease by one .",
    "if @xmath119 denotes the schmidt measure of the graph state corresponding to the graph @xmath120 , then the previous rules can be summarized as    @xmath121    we have used these rules in two ways : firstly , as an internal test to check our calculations , comparing pairs of graphs connected by a sequence of addition or deletion of edges / vertices ; and secondly , as a useful tool that , in some graphs , has enabled us to go from a bounded to a determined value for the schmidt measure , once again by comparison between a problematic graph @xmath17 and a resulting graph @xmath122 ( typically obtained by edge or vertex deletion ) of a known schmidt measure .",
    "there are some special types of graph states in which lower and upper bounds for the schmidt measure coincide ( see @xcite ) , giving directly a determined value for @xmath76 .",
    "since the maximal schmidt rank for any state can be at most @xmath113 , and restricting ourselves to states with coincident upper and lower bounds to @xmath76 , it is true that @xmath123 .",
    "this is the case for ghz states , and states represented by trees , rings with an even number of vertices , and clusters . in our work we have used the following results concerning ghz states and trees :    \\(a ) the schmidt measure for any multipartite ghz state is 1 .",
    "\\(b ) a _ tree _ @xmath124 is a graph that has no cycles .",
    "the schmidt measure of the corresponding graph state @xmath125 is the size of its minimal vertex cover : @xmath126 .",
    "there is another interesting kind of graphs for our purposes , the so - called _ 2-colorable graphs_. a graph is said to be 2-colorable when it is possible to perform a",
    "_ proper 2-coloring _ on it : this is a labeling @xmath127 , such that all connected vertices are associated with a different element from @xmath128 , which can be identified with two colors . it is a well - known fact in graph theory that a necessary and sufficient criterion for a graph to be 2-colorable is that it does not contain any cycles of odd length .",
    "mathematicians call these graphs _ bipartite graphs _ due to the fact that the whole set of vertices can be distributed into two disjoint subsets @xmath88 and @xmath89 , such that no two vertices within the same subset are connected , and therefore every edge connects a vertex in @xmath88 with a vertex in @xmath89 .",
    "heb @xcite provided lower and upper bounds for the schmidt measure that could be applied to graph states represented by 2-colorable graphs : @xmath129 where @xmath82 is the adjacency matrix of the 2-colorable graph .",
    "if @xmath82 is invertible , then @xmath130 besides , heb pointed out that any graph @xmath17 which is not 2-colorable can be turned into a 2-colorable one @xmath122 by simply deleting the appropriate vertices on cycles with odd length present in @xmath17 .",
    "the identification of this graphical action with the effect of a @xmath131 measurement on qubits corresponding to such vertices yields new upper bounds for @xmath104 : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the number of removed vertices .",
    "we have used these new bounds in some graphs as a tool to check our calculations .    [",

    "to sum it all up , we have extended to @xmath0 qubits the classification of the entanglement of graph states proposed in @xcite for @xmath134 qubits . notice that for @xmath45 we have @xmath1 classes , while for @xmath134 there are only 45 classes . for each of these classes",
    "we obtain a representative which requires the minimum controlled-@xmath2 gates for its preparation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and calculate the schmidt measure for the @xmath0-partite split ( which measures the genuine @xmath0-party entanglement of the class ) , and the schmidt ranks for all bipartite splits ( see table  [ maintable ] ) .",

    "more generally , it will help us to investigate the nonlocality ( i.e. , the non - simulability of the predictions of quantum mechanics by means of non - local hidden variable models ) of graph states @xcite .    extending the classification in @xcite",
    "a further step sheds some light on the limitations of the method of classification .",

    "following @xcite , we have placed the class with lower @xmath103 in the first place . however , this solution is not satisfactory , since @xmath103 is not related to the entanglement properties of the class . on the other hand , van den nest , dehaene , and de moor have proposed a finite set of invariants that characterizes all classes @xcite . however , this set has more than @xmath135 invariants already for @xmath43 .",
    "the problem of obtaining a minimum set of invariants capable of distinguishing all classes with @xmath136 qubits will be addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "another weak point in the method is that the precise value of @xmath137 is still unknown for some classes .",
    "the good news is that , for most of these classes , the value might be fixed if we knew the value for the @xmath8-qubit ring cluster state , which is the first graph state in the classification for which the value of @xmath137 is unknown @xcite .",
