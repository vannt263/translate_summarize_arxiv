    "the renormalization of a two - dimensional one - component scalar field theory with a periodic self - interaction , and the two - dimensional generalized sine - gordon model ( gsgm ) have been investigated for @xmath2 dimensions in great detail over the last three decades  @xcite . here",
    ", we only mention some of the main results :    * the blocked potential for the two - dimensional gsgm tends to a constant effective potential in the ir limit , independent of the field @xcite . *",
    "following the procedure proposed in @xcite , one can identically rewrite the partition function of the @xmath4-dimensional gsgm in the form of a @xmath4-dimensional static coulomb gas , which we call here the equivalent coulomb gas ( ecg ) . for @xmath2",
    "it is well - known that the gsgm and the ecg , as well as the xy model describing classical planar spins belong to the same universality class @xcite .",
    "the xy model has a dual theory in the sense of @xcite that can be reformulated as a gas of topological excitations : the two - dimensional vortex gas ( vg ) for @xmath2 , and the three - dimensional vortex - loop gas ( vlg ) for @xmath5 ( see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . for dimensions @xmath2 , it was shown that the ecg and the vg can be transformed into one another by an appropriate duality transformation @xcite that inverts the temperature .",
    "two - dimensional generalized models are well known where both the ecg and the vg are included as particular limiting cases @xcite and are self - dual under the duality transformation .",
    "while the relations of the various models for two dimensions are well - established , those of the corresponding models for @xmath5 are not completely settled ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is not proven that the vlg and the three - dimensional xy - model belong to the same class of universality .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the renormalization of the gsgm and the ecg for @xmath6 dimensions is essential for a further clarification of this issue .",
    "the purpose of the present work is threefold :    1 .   to investigate the renormalization of the gsgm for dimensions @xmath7 by the wegner - houghton renormalization - group ( wh - rg ) method @xcite and to demonstrate numerically that the blocked potential for the @xmath3-dimensional gsgm tends to a constant effective potential in the ir limit ; and 2 .   to perform an rg analysis for the ecg for dimensions @xmath7 by the real - space renormalization group ( rs - rg ) method using the dilute gas approximation ( dga ) @xcite ; and finally 3 .",
    "to compare the rg flows obtained for the gsgm , ecg and vlg @xcite in the three - dimensional case .",
    "renormalization of the gsgm and that of the related models in @xmath6 dimensions are of particular interest with regard to the numerous physical applications . in high - energy physics the haaron model",
    "@xcite of confinement is in need of a clarification of the ir behaviour of the gsgm in @xmath8 dimensions . in low - temperature physics",
    "the superfluid transition of he@xmath9 belongs to the universality class of the three - dimensional xy model and it provides an exceptional opportunity for an experimental test of the rg predictions @xcite . in superconductivity the three - dimensional xy model ( isotropic and anisotropic )",
    "was used to study the phase transitions in the three - dimensional flux - line lattice @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional xy model can also help us in understanding the flux motions in superconductors with extremely high anisotropy ; these have been observed in recent experiments @xcite .    due to the fact that the gsgm and the ecg are equivalent at the level of the partition function , their renormalization - group flows obtained by applying different rg methods are alternative approaches to tackle essentially the same problem . on the one hand ,",
    "the wh - rg applied to the gsgm keeps the periodicity of the self - interaction potential in each infinitesimal blocking step .",
    "there is a price to pay : one has to handle infinitely many vertices in the process of searching the blocked action in the subspace of functionals periodic in the field variable .",
    "furthermore , the requirements of periodicity and convexity @xcite are laid upon the effective potential of the model which constrain it to a field - independent constant @xcite .",
    "the wh - rg has the advantage that ( i ) it can be extrapolated to the ir limit and ( ii ) is able to treat the spinodal instability @xcite .",
    "its main disadvantage is that the truncation of the gradient expansion is unavoidable and that the implementation of the sharp momentum cut - off can induce unphysical features of the rg flow going beyond the local - potential approximation ( lpa ) @xcite . by restricting ourselves to lpa",
    ", we ignore the wave - function renormalization , which is equivalent to neglecting the scale - dependence of the temperature beyond the tree - level and its physical consequences .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rs - rg applied to the ecg keeps intact the cg structure in each blocking step and therefore also the periodicity , albeit indirectly .",
    "it implements a sharp cut - off in real space and has been proven very adequate for applications to the two - dimensional coulomb gas @xcite and to the three - dimensional vortex - loop gas @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has the drawbacks that ( i ) no systematic approach is known to go beyond the dilute - gas approximation ( dga ) , and ( ii ) the sharp cut - off in real space , which is effectively a smooth momentum cut - off , is inadequate to treat the spinodal instability . because our wh - rg approach will show that the latter always occurs , the interpretation of the extrapolation of our rs - rg results for the ecg to the ir regime is problematic",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to compare the rs - rg results for the ecg in the uv regime to those for the gas of topological excitations ( e.g. the vlg for @xmath5 ) .",
    "the phase transition of systems in the universality class of the two - dimensional coulomb gas , known as the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii phase transition , is a topological phase transition because there is no spatial long - range order for @xmath2 dimensions at finite temperature due to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . for @xmath10 dimensions the mermin - wagner theorem does not hold any more",
    "therefore , one expects a modification of the phase structure of the coulomb gas in the number of dimensions @xmath11 as compared to the case with @xmath2 .",
    "as shown below , the uv scaling laws in @xmath11 for both the gsgm and the ecg share the property of a lacking coleman fixed point , which by contrast is present for @xmath2 @xcite .    in sect . [",

    "this means that ( i ) the wh - rg in lpa keeps periodicity of the blocked potential , and ( ii ) the period @xmath94 in the internal space does not depend on the scale .",
    "note that these statements are only valid for the dimensionful potential as the local functional of the dimensionful field .",
    "since the blocked potential @xmath95 tends to the effective potential @xmath96 in the ir limit @xmath97 , the effective potential should be periodic , as well .",

    "a renormalization - group analysis of the generalized sine - gordon model ( gsgm ) and that of the equivalent coulomb gas ( ecg ) have been pursued for @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "the rg equations for the gsgm and the ecg are derived in two ways : ( i ) by means of wegner s and houghton s ( wh - rg ) method in the local - potential approximation and ( ii ) by the real - space rg ( rs - rg ) in the dilute - gas approximation .",
    "these different approaches complement one another : the wh - rg applied to the gsgm is better suited to determine the ir behaviour of the system , whereas the rs - rg applied to the ecg is able to better represent the non - linearities which influence the uv scaling .",
    "it has been shown that the leading - order terms of the flow equations obtained by these methods agree well .",
    "taking as an example the @xmath3-dimensional gsgm , we have demonstrated numerically that the blocked potential tends to a constant effective potential , independent of the field - variable , in the ir limit .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with the global requirements on the rg flow that constrain the effective potential to be periodic and convex at the same time . comparing the evolution of the periodic blocked potential to that of a polynomial potential obtained by a taylor - expansion of the bare periodic potential ,",
    "we show that a violation of the periodicity would lead to a completely incorrect ir scaling .",
    "the flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ linsg ] shows that only a single phase occurs in our approximation , and that the uv - irrelevant , dimensionless parameter @xmath66 becomes relevant in the ir regime .    because the gsgm , the ecg and the xy - model belong to the same universality class , the determination of the rg flow of these models for the three - dimensional case via two different , complementary methods in the uv regime enables us to compare the uv scaling with that of a three - dimensional vortex gas ( vlg ) @xcite .",
