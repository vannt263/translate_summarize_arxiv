    "particle physics models including weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) are highly motivated both from the theoretical as well as the experimental point of view@xcite . on the theory side ,",
    "susy stabilizes the higgs sector , and allows one to extrapolate physics safely to very high energy scales . on the experimental side ,",
    "the most impressive argument comes from extrapolating the measured values of the three standard model ( sm ) gauge couplings from the weak scale to the gut scale .",
    "the celebrated unification of gauge couplings at @xmath5 gev seems to indicate that 1 .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , or mssm plus gauge singlets ( or extra @xmath6 multiplets ) , is the correct effective field theory all the way up to @xmath7 and that 2 .",
    "the unification certainly looks gut - like , and that a susy gut theory may be the correct effective field theory around @xmath8 . of the various gut theories , @xmath9 stands out in that it unifies not only the three sm forces , but also all the particles of each sm generation ( into the 16 dimensional spinor of @xmath9 ) . in the simplest @xmath9 susy gut models , yukawa couplings of the third generation",
    "are also expected to unify .",
    "there are a host of susy models which are consistent with gauge coupling unification .",
    "some of them i list below :    * gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) , * anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) , * mixed moduli - amsb ( mirage unification models ) * hypercharged amsb * deflected amsb * gravity -mediated susy breaking models@xcite , * msugra ( also known as cmssm ) * one and two parameter non - universal higgs models ( nuhm1,nuhm2 ) , * non - universal gaugino masses in various guises * normal scalar mass hierarchy ( broken generations ) with @xmath10 , * compressed susy * split susy , pmssm , nmssm , * @xmath11 .    lately , gravity - mediated susy breaking models seem most popular because they can easily accommodate susy breaking via supergravity effects , and seem to most easily accommodate cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe .",
    "of the gravity - mediated models , most work has been done on the msugra ( or cmssm ) model . whether it is right or wrong , it is at least simple , consistent with all data , and exhibits many intriguing features which might be observable in the next round of collider and dark matter experiments .",
    "so most of the results i show will come from that model . at the end , i will coment on yukawa - unified models , which only seem to occur when non - universality of soft susy breaking terms is allowed , as in the nuhm2 model .",

    "if gravitinos are heavier than the other susy particles , then they decay into them with late - time decays , which can disrupt the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",

    "in addition , another problem ( that one neglects at one s peril ) is the strong cp problem .",
    "the compelling solution here is the original peccei - quinn - weinberg - wilczek solution@xcite , which implies existence of an axion particle @xmath24 .",
    "cosmology constrains the pq breaking scale @xmath25 gev , which means @xmath26 ev .",

    "that the @xmath12 is the lightest mssm particle , then it will decay @xmath31 ( or possibly other modes ) with a lifetime of order 1 second or less .",
    "thus , it avoids the bbn problem ( as long as @xmath32 is heavy ) , but neutralinos will still give rise to @xmath33 at colliders .    for a given hypothesis of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",

    "the blue regions have @xmath36 gev , which at least allows for non - thermal leptogenesis@xcite .",
    "the relevance of this plot for leptonic signatures at the lhc is that the entire lep2-allowed parameter space of msugra is also cdm - allowed , in the case of mixed axion / axino cdm : one should not focus just on the special neutralino dm - allowed regions for lhc susy signatures .",
    "now on to leptonic lhc signatures !     needed to generate the wmap measured cdm abundance using mixed axion / axino ( but mainly axion ) cdm in the msugra model . ]",
    "direct production of sleptons can take place at lhc via the drell - yan mechanism : @xmath37-channel @xmath38 and @xmath39 exchange leads to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 production , while @xmath37-channel @xmath43 exchange leads to @xmath44 production .",

    "a clean ( jet - free ) trilepton signature can arise from @xmath55 production , followed by @xmath56 and @xmath57 decay@xcite .",
    "in fact , this susy production cross section can be the dominant one at lhc in the case where squarks and sleptons have mass greater than about a tev . in the case of the clean @xmath58 signal ,",
    "we require each lepton to obey a `` cone '' isolation requirement to reject leptons arising from heavy flavor decay , and then require @xmath59 gev for the three hardest isolated leptons .",
    "we will also require a `` central jet veto '' ( clean trileptons ) , and @xmath60 _ less than _ 100 gev , finally , require a leptonic @xmath39 veto to reject bg from wz production . in this case , sm backgrounds are generally lower than susy signal in regions where the @xmath61 branching fraction is substantial .",
    "it is substantial as long as other two body `` spoiler '' modes such as @xmath62 or @xmath63 are closed , or there is not large interference in the 3-body neutralino decay which suppresses the leptonic bfs .",
    "a virtue of this signal is that the dilepton pair from @xmath64 is kinematically constrained to obey @xmath65 ( for 3-body decays ) or a similar constraint if @xmath66 occurs@xcite .",
    "while slepton pair production and gaugino pair production can lead to clean multi - lepton events as lhc , we also expect multiple isolated lepton plus multijet plus @xmath33 events to arise from gluino and squark production@xcite .",
    "the strong interaction processes @xmath67 are expected to be the dominant susy production modes at lhc as long as @xmath68 tev",
    ".    the @xmath69 and @xmath70 states will then undergo `` cascade decays '' : possibly multi - step decay processes into sm particles plus the lighter superpartners until the state containing the lsp is reached .",
    "there are of order 1000 sparticle subprocess production reactions , and numerous decay modes of each sparticle , which are listed as output by programs such as isasusy / isasugra , susyhit and spheno .",
    "thus , roughly @xmath71 sparticle @xmath72 reactions can occur at lhc in the case of the mssm .",
    "the exact decay patterns are model dependent , and vary significantly around parameter space of any model . generally , we expect gluno and squark cascade decay events to contain numerous high @xmath0 jets ( including numerous @xmath73-jets and possibly @xmath15 jets , especially at large @xmath17@xcite ) , numerous isolated @xmath74s and @xmath75s and @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient to classify events according to the isolated leptons :    @xmath76jets    @xmath77 jets    opposite - sign ( os ) dileptons @xmath78 jets    same - sign ( ss ) dileptons @xmath78 jets    @xmath79 jets ,    @xmath80 jets ,    @xmath11 .",

    ", i mentioned that susy gut theories based on the gauge group @xmath9 have a high degree of motivation in that they unify matter , in addition to unification of gauge couplings .",
    "the matter unification only works if one introduces a superfield @xmath102 ( @xmath103 a generation index ) containing a gauge singlet right hand neutrino state : exactly what is needed to give neutrinos mass and to explain neutrino oscillation data . in the simplest models , one also expects the yukawa couplings of the third generation to unify at the gut scale : @xmath104 unification .",
    "a scan over parameter space of the msugra model shows that such unification which depends strongly on the @xmath105 , @xmath73 and @xmath15 masses , and on their weak scale threshold corrections can not occur@xcite . at large @xmath106",
    ", they would like to unify , but radiative ewsb breaks down because the down - higgs soft term runs more negative than the up - higgs soft term .",
    "a way around this is to move to the nuhm2 model where @xmath107 at @xmath7 , and neither is equal to @xmath20 , the msugra common scalar mass@xcite .",
    "this is called `` just - so '' higgs splitting ( hs ) .",
    "one can also use @xmath9 @xmath108-term splitting , combined with generation splitting and inclusion of right - hand neutrino yukawa coupling effects ( the dr3 model@xcite ) .",
    "a scan over @xmath9 model parameter space reveals that indeed in the hs or dr3 model , yukawa unification can occur , but only for a very special range susy parameters leading to an inverted scalar mass hierarchy ( imh)@xcite . the unification occurs if @xmath109 tev , and @xmath19 is as small as allowed by lep2 experiments .",
    "also , @xmath110 .",

    "the model is very compelling , except that it predicts a neutralino relic abundance of around @xmath116 times that measured by wmap .",
    "so it is excluded ?",
    "here , we invoke the pqww solution to the strong cp problem , with an axino mass @xmath112 mev scale . then the @xmath117 decay reduces the relic abundance by a factor of @xmath118 !",
    "the cosmology was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and works best if dark matter is composed of mainly cold axions , with a small contribution of thermal and non - thermal axinos .",
    "we expect the gravitino mass @xmath119 tev , which means the gravitino decays before the onset of bbn , so the gravitino problem is solved .",
    "in addition , the model allows a re - heat temperature @xmath120 gev : enough to sustain at least non - thermal leptogenesis ( wherein the heavy right - hand neutrino states are produced via inflaton decay ) .",
    "the whole scenario is very compelling , but how do we test it ?",
    "well , the rather light gluinos mean gluino pairs will be produced at high rates at the lhc , and may even yield signals during the first year of running in the multi - mu plus jets channel , or multi-@xmath73-jet channel@xcite .",
    "the dimuon spectrum should exhibit the characteristic mass edge around @xmath121 gev . also , the prediction is that there will be no signals in any direct or indirect wimp search channels .",
    "however , the admx experiment stands a good chance of finding an axion signal in their cryogenic microwave cavity experiment@xcite .",
    "i present my conclusions as a bullet list .    in many gravity mediated models , such as msugra , the axion / axino mixture is ( imo ) a better candidate for cdm than neutralinos .",
    "if so , then entirely different regions of model parameter space are preferred .",
    "yukawa unified susy has a very characteristic spectrum with light gluinos and heavy squarks .",
    "it gives robust signatures at lhc in the first year of running .",
    "it is cosmologically viable if the dark matter is composed of an axion axino admixture ( but with mainly axions ) .",

    "<S> direct production of gauginos and sleptons should also be possible in limited regions of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> even in the first year of lhc running , observable signals in multi - muon plus jets channel ( without cutting on missing @xmath0 ) can occur for interesting ranges of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the highly motivated yukawa unified susy models where the dark matter is expected to be of mixed axion / axino type should likely be testable in the first year of lhc running due to large rates for gluino pair production followed by cascade decays .     </S>",
