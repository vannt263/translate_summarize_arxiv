    "it has since been classified as a _",
    "microquasar _ : a galactic jet source with properties similar to quasars , but on a stellar scale .",
    "the mass of the central compact object is estimated to be 14@xmath94 @xmath10 ( greiner et al .",
    "the authors reported results on the optical counterpart that implied a k - m iii donating star of @xmath0 1.2 @xmath10 , making grs 1915 + 105 a low - mass x - ray binary .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is well - known for its extreme variability across all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum ( belloni et al . 2000 ) .    in 1998 ,",
    "bepposax observations of grs 1915 + 105 showed the clear presence of a broad emission line at 6.4 kev ( martocchia et al .",
    "2002 ) , i.e. the fe k@xmath11 line .",
    "the fe k@xmath11 emission line is a doublet consisting of the k@xmath111 and k@xmath112 lines at 6.404 kev and 6.391 kev .",
    "such emission lines are likely produced by irradiation of the accretion disk by an external source of hard x - rays ( an external x - ray source is required because accretion disks do not efficiently self - irradiate ) .",
    "it is generally thought that hard x - rays originate in a hot , diffuse corona that inverse - compton scatters soft x - ray photons emitted by the accretion disk .",
    "irradiation of the dense disk material by the hard x - rays then gives rise to a characteristic  reflection \" spectrum that results from compton scattering and photoelectric absorption ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "photoelectric absorption within the disk leads to the formation of the fluorescent iron emission line at about 6.4 kev . in stellar - mass black holes , highly ionized iron lines",
    "are typically observed ( miller 2007 ) .",
    "because of its large cosmic abundance and high fluorescent yield , the fe k@xmath11 line is the most prominent line in the x - ray reflection spectrum .",
    "disk reflection is an important diagnostic of black hole spacetime geometry and general relativistic ( gr ) effects ( e.g. fabian 1989 ; laor 1991 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "it is believed that the iron line originates in the innermost parts of the accretion disk and thus is highly distorted by newtonian , special relativistic beaming , and gr effects ( e.g. fabian , et al .",
    "this skewing explains the broad , skewed iron line profile that is observed in some stellar - mass x - ray binaries , such as cygnus x-1 and grs 1915 + 105 ( see miller 2007 ) .    in our modeling of the x - ray spectrum",
    ", we make the assumption that the accretion disk extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) in the low / hard state .",
    "this may seem contrary to some models , in which the low / hard state is characterized by an inner disk boundary that is outside the isco .",
    "however , several pieces of evidence suggest that our assumption is likely to be accurate for grs 1915 + 105 . as follows , we observed grs 1915 + 105 in the the low / hard state , which is characterized by an energy spectrum that is dominated by a power - law - like component . while there is a typical photon index of @xmath0 1.6 and a high - energy cutoff at @xmath0 100 kev ( fender & belloni 2004 ) ,",
    "there is also a very weak soft x - ray component ( most likely associated with a thermal disk ) ( miller et al .",
    "according to nowak ( 1995 ) , the total x - ray luminosity for systems in the low / hard state where distance and mass estimates are known is generally below 10% of the eddington luminosity .",
    "esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , gave an archetypal model of how accretion flows change with state .",
    "in that model , the inner disk in the low / hard state is radially truncated at low mass accretion rates ( corresponding to @xmath12 @xmath13 0.008 ) and an advection - dominated accretion flow is present .",
    "however , the luminosity observed in grs 1915 + 105 ( l @xmath0 0.30 @xmath14 ) is higher than what is theoretically calculated for a truncated disk in the low / hard state ( esin et al . 2007 )",
    ". this higher luminosity , and therefore higher mass accretion rate , is indicative of inner disk extending closer to the black hole ( e.g. esin et al .",
    "2007 : fig . 1 ) and supports the notion that radially recessed disks in the low hard state may not always be the case .",
    "recent analyses of gx 339 - 4 , cygnus x-1 , swift j1753.5 - 0127 , and xte j1817 - 330 have also revealed cool accretion disks that appear to remain close to the black hole at low accretion rates ( miller et al .",
    "2006a , b , rykoff et al .",
    "2007 , tomsick et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the radius of the isco is determined by the spin of the black hole : @xmath15 = 6.0 @xmath16 for _ _ @xmath17__=0 , and @xmath15 = 1.25 @xmath16 for an astrophysical maximum of _ @xmath17 _ = 0.998 ( where @xmath16 = gm/@xmath18 and _ @xmath17 _ = cj / g@xmath19 , see thorne 1974 , and bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) . the location of the isco determines the `` strength '' of the gravitational effects on the fe k emission line ( and broadband reflection spectrum ) , thereby influencing how broad and skewed the line profile becomes .",
    "therefore , determining the isco through line fitting serves as an indirect measure of the black hole spin parameter .",
    "spectral fits to thermal emission from the accretion disk in black hole binaries provides an independent way to constrain black hole spin . in order to turn",
    "the flux observed from the disk continuum into a radius ( and therefore a spin parameter ) , the source distance , inclination , and mass must be known .",
    "in addition , factors like the line of sight absorption , hardening due to scattering in the disk atmosphere , and the form of the hard spectral component can be important . in order to obtain reliable spin estimates using the continuum method ,",
    "it is crucial for the source to have a strong thermal component ( e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2009 ) . for the case of grs 1915 + 105 , this thermal component is most easily observed while in the high / soft state .",
    "however , prior spin results that have been reported for grs 1915@xmath2105 in this state are not consistent .",
    "mcclintock et al . ( 2006 ) and middleton et al . (",
    "2006 ) both used models for thermal continuum emission from the accretion disk to calculate values of _ @xmath17 _ @xmath200.98 and @xmath21 , respectively . in this paper , we present an independent analysis using the relativistic disk reflection spectrum to calculate the black hole spin in grs 1915 + 105 in the low / hard state with the advanced cameras on _",

    "the xis cameras were operated using the 1/4 window mode using a 1.0 s burst option .",
    "the xis1 and hxd / pin cameras were used in this analysis .",
    "two other xis units were turned off to preserve telemetry and the fourth unit was run in a special timing mode ( which has yet to be calibrated ) .",

    "an annulus centered on the source was also used for the background extraction region with an inner radius of 208@xmath24 and an outer radius of 271@xmath24 ( 200 and 260 in pixel units , respectively ) .",
    "we manually corrected for extracted region areas that did not land on the xis chip .",
    "the xis redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) were created using the tools ` xisrmfgen ` and ` xissimarfgen ` available in the heasoft version 6.6.2 data reduction package .",
    "the 3 x 3 mode event file was used to specify good time intervals and the data was grouped to a minimum of 25 counts per bin using the ftool ` grppha ` .    for the hxd data ,",
    "the latest calibration databases ( caldb 20070710 ) were used and the reduction process began with a clean event file from the pin detector ( energy range 10.0@xmath170.0 kev ) , which was at xis aimpoint . in the pin data reduction process ,",
    "the pin spectrum was extracted and deadtime was corrected by using the pseudo - events files . after the non - x - ray ( nxb ) background spectrum was extracted , the exposure time of the background spectrum was increased by a factor of 10 since the nxb event file was calculated with a count rate 10 times higher than the real background count rate to reduce statistical errors .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background was simulated , modeled and added to the nxb spectrum in xspec version 12.5.0 as instructed in the _ suzaku _ abc guide .",
    "using the x - ray spectral fitting software package ( xspec v. 12.5.0 , arnaud 1996 ) , we initially fit the _ suzaku _ xis spectrum of grs 1915@xmath2105 with a simple absorbed power law model : ` phabs*(powerlaw ) ` , with the ` phabs ` model component accounting for galactic photoelectric absorption .",
    "all parameters were allowed to vary .",
    "the 4.0@xmath17.0 kev range was ignored when fitting the data to obtain an unbiased view of the fe k range .",
    "the fit resulted in an equivalent hydrogen column , @xmath22 , of @xmath25 ( in units of @xmath26@xmath27 ) and a photon index , @xmath28 , of @xmath29 ( @xmath30/@xmath31 = 1402/1282 ) . that ignored energy range",
    "was then restored when forming the data / model ratio as shown in figure 1 .",
    "an asymmetric , skewed line is revealed in the exact way predicted for relativistic disk lines . in a similar manner ,",
    "figure 2 shows the xis and hxd spectra fit with a simple model consisting of a broken power - law modified by interstellar absorption : ` phabs*(bknpow ) ` .",
    "a constant was allowed to float between the two data sets .",
    "the 4.0@xmath17.0 kev and 15.0@xmath145.0 kev ranges were ignored when fitting in order to properly model the continuum .",
    "note that for the hxd spectra , the model was fit over the 12.0@xmath115.0 kev and 45.0@xmath155.0 kev energy ranges .",

    "again , the ignored energy ranges were restored when forming the data / model ratio .",
    "note that the residuals near 12 kev can be attributed to calibration problems near the edge of the detector .",
    "xspec provides a number of models for spectral line fitting .",
    "models of particular interest to us not only allow for analysis of the observed broad iron line in our data , but account for the special and gr effects that physically go into creating such an emission profile around a black hole . since determining the black hole spin of grs 1915 + 105 through analysis of the iron line is our main priority , models that allow spin to be a free parameter in our fits are useful .",
    "brenneman & reynolds ( 2006 ) have calculated models ( ` kerrdisk ` and ` kerrconv ` ) that describe line emission from an accretion disk and include black hole spin as a free parameter , thereby allowing us to formally constrain the angular momentum of the black hole and other physical parameters of the system .",
    "the ` kerrdisk ` model describes line emission from an accretion disk , while the ` kerrconv ` model allows one to convolve a reflection spectrum with the smeared line function .",
    "although general relativity permits the spin parameter _",
    "@xmath17 _ to have any arbitrary value , black holes can in principle have spin parameters -1 @xmath38 _ @xmath17 _ @xmath38 1 .",
    "however , for simplicity the ` kerrdisk ` model only considers a black hole that has a prograde spin relative to the accretion disk that spins up to the thorne ( 1974 ) spin - equilibrium limit , i.e. , 0 @xmath38 _ @xmath17 _ @xmath38 0.998 .",
    "in addition to the spin parameter , we can specify and/or constrain nine other physical parameters in the ` kerrdisk ` model : ( 1 ) rest frame energy of the line , ( 2 ) emissivity index within a specified radius , ( 3 ) emissivity index at radii larger than a specified value , ( 4 ) break radius separating the inner and outer portions of the disk ( in units of gravitational radii ) , ( 5 ) the disk inclination angle to the line of sight , ( 6 ) the inner radius of the disk in units of the radius of marginal stability ( rms ) , ( 7 ) the outer radius under consideration , ( 8) the cosmological redshift of the source ( _ _ z__=0 for our source ) , and ( 9 ) the normalization ( flux ) of the line in photons @xmath27 @xmath39 .",
    "` kerrconv ` has the same basic set of parameters with the exception that it does not require an input line energy or a flux normalization parameter since it uses a ` kerrdisk ` kernel to smear the entire spectrum with relativistic effects .",
    "of these parameters , we let 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 9 vary freely .",
    "we bounded the rest frame energy for the iron line between 6.4 and 6.97 kev and the disk inclination between @xmath40 and @xmath41 based on the figure presented in fender et al .",
    "( 1999 : fig .",
    "6 ) from radio jet observations .",
    "the emissivity indices were fixed to be equal to each other meaning that we only consider one index , making the break radius meaningless .",
    "parameters 4 , 6 and 7 were frozen at 6.0 @xmath16 , 1.0 rms , and 400 rms , respectively using the  standard \" values of the ` kerrdisk ` and ` kerrconv ` models . by doing this ,",
    "we assume that the ionization of the disk material within the isco is too high to produce significant line emission as has been shown by 3d mhd simulations ( reynolds & fabian 2008 ) .",
    "as shown in fig.3 , our model is defined as : ` phabs*(kerrdisk + kerrconv*pexriv ) ` .",
    "a constant was allowed to float between the xis and hxd data sets .",
    "the model component ` pexriv ` is an exponentially cut - off power - law spectrum reflected from ionized material ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the free parameters are the power - law photon index @xmath28 , the fold energy or cutoff energy ( in kev ) , and the scaling factor for reflection .",
    "our results are given in table 1 with the model being fit in the 2.3@xmath110.0 kev and 12.0@xmath155.0 kev energy ranges .",
    "note that the residual feature at the upper limit of the xis detector is the result of noise .",
    "errors were calculated using the _ steppar _ command in xspec , which affords control over how the @xmath30 space is searched .",
    "for all parameters , errors refer to the 68@xmath42 confidence level ( @xmath43@xmath30= 1 ) unless otherwise stated .",
    "the reduced @xmath30 of our best - fit is 2345/2224 .",
    "we measure a spin value of @xmath44 .",
    "figure 5 plots the dependence of @xmath30 on the black hole spin parameter .",
    "a spin of zero is excluded at the @xmath8 level of confidence .",
    "the disk ionization parameter ( @xmath45 = @xmath46 , where n is the hydrogen number density ) has a large effect on the resulting spectrum .",
    "ross et al . ( 1999 ) demonstrated the effect on reflection spectra models for a range of ionization values ( 30@xmath3 @xmath45 @xmath3 @xmath47 ) .",
    "the model with the highest ionization parameter , @xmath45 = @xmath47 was the best reflector but had negligible iron spectral features due to the disk surface layer being fully ionized at great depth , with the iron line ( specifically , fe xxvi ) not becoming dominant until @xmath48 @xmath49 8 . however , when @xmath45 is reduced to 3 x @xmath50 , less than half of the iron",
    "is fully ionized at the disk s surface and fe xxv becomes dominant at @xmath48 @xmath49 1 .",
    "most importantly , at this value an iron emission line that is compton - broadened becomes visible ( ross et al .",
    "1999 : fig 2 ) .",
    "similar to this ionization value is our value of 5000 , which is the upper limit allowed by the ` pexriv ` model .",
    "this `` high '' value was chosen so as to obtain the maximum amount of broadening due to comptonization and further understand the dynamics of the system . in our model , maximizing or minimizing the disk temperature ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 kelvin , respectively ) changed @xmath30 by less than 5 , resulting in similar reduced @xmath30 to the best - fit value ( @xmath30/@xmath31 @xmath0 1.05 ) .",
    "effects to the parameter values ( most notably the spin parameter ) were negligible with the exception of the reflection scaling factor , which changed by @xmath3 0.06 .",
    "note that a thermal disk component is not required for our model and , since the disk itself is likely to be relatively cool and the high galactic photoelectric absorption prevents its detection , we have set a low disk temperature ( see , e.g. , miller et al .  2006 ,",
    "rykoff et al .  2007 ) .",
    "given the complexity of the source and it s extreme variability , we had set the iron abundance equal to the solar value to provide a more simplistic approach to constraining the spin , our main parameter of interest . using the upper limit on the ionization value we tested the effects of altering the iron abundance in the ` pexriv ` model .",
    "ross & fabian ( 2005 : fig .",
    "5 ) show that increasing the iron abundance relative to the solar value serves to lower the continuum while enhancing the fe k@xmath11 emission lines .",
    "additionally , lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured an iron abundance , fe / solar , @xmath20 1.0 for grs 1915 + 105 , conveying that the overabundance may be due to dynamics of supernova in the microquasar s history . however , ueda et al .",
    "( 2009 ) were more definitive in fitting a spectrum with better statistics using solar values for the abundances ( including iron ) .",
    "as such , after testing the effects of varying abundance , our ` pexriv ` model did not require an enhanced abundance ( e.g. tripling the iron abundance increased @xmath30 by @xmath0 100 ) .",
    "our broadband model uses ` pexriv ` as its main reflection component .",
    "one difficulty with this model is that it does not include the effects of comptonization on photoelectric absorption edges in the outer , most highly ionized layers of the disk .",
    "being statistically inferior in this regime , it may not be ideal to use this model for high values of @xmath45 , which is the reason our value of 5000 erg cm / s is the upper limit . in order to check how our spin constraints might depend on the reflection model",
    ", we replaced ` pexriv ` with a newer , more self - consistent reflection model : ` reflionx ` ( see fig .",
    "the ` reflionx ` model is a revised version of reflion ( ross & fabian 2005 ) that describes reflection from accretion disks in black hole systems where the blackbody emission is at too low an energy to affect the fe k@xmath11 emission .",
    "it has been used previously to constrain the spin in other sources such as gx 339 - 4 ( reis et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the parameters of the model are the iron abundance ( set to solar ) , photon index of the illuminating power law , ionization parameter , @xmath45 , and the normalization . in fitting ` reflionx ` , the hxd spectrum was neglected because a cut - off power - law is required whereas ` reflionx ` assumes that a simple power - law spectrum irradiates the disk . moreover , ` reflionx ` is a pure reflection model that requires a simple power - law to represent the continuum .",
    "note that the fe k emission line is self - consistently modeled within the ` reflionx ` model .",
    "also , in order to obtain better constraints within the ` reflionx ` model , the inclination was bounded between at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the model was fit in the 2.3@xmath110.0 kev energy range .",
    "letting @xmath17 be a free parameter , the ` phabs*(powerlaw+kerrconv*reflionx ) ` model resulted in a spin parameter of 0.56 with a @xmath30 value of approximately 2124 and a reduced @xmath30 @xmath0 1.01 for 2100 degrees of freedom ( see table 2 ) .",
    "based on these results from the ` reflionx ` model , we can state that @xmath4 is preferred and that a spin of zero is excluded at the @xmath53 level of confidence ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . however , it is important to note that the parameter values obtained with the ` reflionx ` model are poorly constrained , which requires the ` pexriv ` results to be viewed with extra caution ( see sect .",
    "finally , we note the possible presence of an absorption line at approximately 7.4  kev ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is not clear that the feature is real .",
    "when the broadband spectrum is fit phenomenologically , a gaussian model for the line suggests a ( single - trial ) significance of @xmath53 .",
    "the feature is not significant after fitting the relativistic emission line and disk reflection continuum .",
    "if the line is real , it could plausibly be associated with fe xxv or fe xxvi , implying a wind with a blue - shift as high as @xmath54 . when a strong line is frozen as part of the overall spectral model , even modest constraints on the spin parameter of the black hole can not be obtained . however , a wind in a hard state would be inconsistent with an apparent anti - correlation between winds and jets in grs 1915@xmath2105 ( miller et al .",
    "2008a , nielsen & lee 2009 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first results from _ suzaku _ observations of grs 1915@xmath2105 in a low / hard state .",

    "( 2006 ) can be partly attributed to the state classifications ( i.e. a , b , c ) for grs 1915 + 105 as opposed to the black hole binary categories used by mcclintock et al .",
    "the spin estimate reported by mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) was obtained in a state that resembles the  thermal state \" ( i.e. high / soft state or  thermal dominant \" state ) . here",
    ", our observation was obtained in the low / hard state ( which is mostly likely `` state c '' ) .",
    "previous work has suggested that for non - spinning black holes , the amount of fe k emission from within the isco is negligible : inside the isco , the ionization fraction sufficiently increases close to the black hole making it unlikely that there is significant fe k emission within the isco since the ionization fraction substantially increases ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) .",
    "reynolds & fabian ( 2008 ) find that systematic errors on the spin due to emission from within the isco become smaller for more rapidly rotating black holes",
    ". additionally , shafee et al . (",
    "2008 ) determined that magnetic coupling is unimportant across the isco for geometrically thin disks .",
    "the best current theoretical works suggests that systematic errors are unlikely to bias our results for grs 1915 + 105 ( reynolds & fabian 2008 ) .",
    "an @xmath60 disk emissivity relation is typically assumed for line emission from a standard thin accretion disk with an isotropic source of disk irradiation ( see , e.g , reynolds & nowak 2003 ) .",
    "freezing the emissivity index at 3.0 in the ` pexriv ` and ` reflionx ` models resulted in worse fits with @xmath43@xmath30 @xmath61 200 for 1 degree of freedom ( f - value @xmath20180 , @xmath20 8.0@xmath5 level of confidence ) .",
    "our current best - fit value for the emissivity index in grs 1915 + 105 is of interest because it implies that the reflected emission has a weaker dependence on the radius ( @xmath62 ) than is typical .",
    "when the emissivity index is high , as in the case for many spinning active galactic nuclei , there is significant iron line flux below 4 kev from material closest to the black hole and therefore high gravitational redshift .",
    "this is not true when the emissivity index is low .",
    "thus , spin determination for grs 1915 + 105 case is being driven more by the detailed shape of the body of the iron line rather than the overall line extent .",
    "this could explain much of the difference between the ` pexriv ` and ` reflionx ` results .",
    "moreover , a stable warp at the inner disk ( e.g. due to lense - thirring precession ) is a possible explanation for our different emissivity index value in that it would reflect more than expected at larger radii .",
    "a link between fe k emission and the phase of low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the low / hard state of grs 1915@xmath2105 may provide evidence for such a warp ( miller & homan 2005 ) .",
    "martocchia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) made two _ xmm - newton _ observations of grs 1915 + 105 in 2004 during a long  plateau \" ( lower flux ) state .",
    "the data was analyzed with epic - pn in timing and burst modes , respectively . for the timing mode , they detected a broad excess at the energy of the iron line and fit the data from 2.0@xmath110.0 kev with the disk reflection model ` diskline ` ( fabian et al .",
    "martocchia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found an inner radius of the disk in excess of 300 @xmath63 for an unabsorbed flux of 1.0@xmath90.1 ( @xmath64 @xmath65 ) in the 2.0@xmath110.0 kev energy range .",
    "although such a disk would have the advantage of providing a geometric explanation for the major x - ray spectral transitions seen in galactic black holes ( done & gierliski 2006 ) , the high ( unabsorbed ) flux ( @xmath0 3.3 x @xmath64 @xmath65 ) and hence high luminosity ( @xmath0 0.30 @xmath14 ) we calculated in the 0.5@xmath1100 kev range for grs 1915 + 105 make it unlikely that the disk would be recessed to such a high value ( e.g. esin et al .",
    "1997 , frank , king & raine 2002 , also see miller et al .",
    "we note that the high flux of grs 1915 + 105 may have caused photon pile - up in the epic - pn timing mode , thereby obscuring the breadth of the line and affecting the martocchia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) results .    based on vla observations of relativistic ejections from grs 1915 + 105",
    ", @xmath66 is the typical value used for the inclination of this source ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "however , in our broadband model the inclination angle pegged at @xmath40 , which is close to the lowest plausible value for this black hole binary ( we set the bounds between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , fender et al .",
    "1999 : fig . 6 ) .",
    "allowing the inclination to vary over a greater range ( @xmath67@xmath1 @xmath68 ) resulted in our broadband model finding the minimum @xmath30 at @xmath69 , which we disregard on the basis that it is not consistent with previous radio jet observations ( e.g. mirabel & rodrguez 1994 , fender et al .",
    "given our assumption that the spin axis of the black hole is parallel to the jet axis , our best - fit spin and inclination results follow from self - consistent assumptions .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "the resulting parameter values in the ` reflionx ` model are not well constrained . to better demonstrate the dependence between parameters , particularly for the spin parameter , figures 7 and 8 show the 68 , 90 and 99 % contour plots for inclination versus spin for both the ` reflionx ` and ` pexriv ` models , respectively . as shown for the ` reflionx ` model , there is a large degree of variation between the inclination and spin values whereas for the ` pexriv ` model , the spin and inclination values are more restricted . due to the poor constraints in the ` reflionx ` model , the ` pexriv ` model results must be regarded with more caution .    among stellar - mass black holes ,",
    "grs 1915@xmath2105 displays uniquely rich and complex phenomena , both in x - rays and at shorter wavelengths .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is similarly complex , and whether using the disk continuum or the reflection spectrum to constrain the spin , data seletion and modeling nuances can be important .",
    "currently , our broadband model ( ` pexriv ` ) gives a spin parameter that is in agreement with the value reported by mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( _ @xmath17 _ @xmath20 0.98 ) , while the upper limit on our soft x - ray spectrum model ( ` reflionx ` ) spin result is lower than the middleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) spin value . in this effort to constrain the spin of grs 1915@xmath2105 ,",
    "we have considered only a single observation in a single state , though disk reflection is sure to be important in many states .",
    "future observations with _ suzaku _ and",
    "_ xmm - newton _ in different states may allow the spin to be determined more clearly using the disk reflection spectrum .",
    "the thermal disk continuum is not evident in our observation , but future efforts that make joint use of the direct and reflected disk spectrum to constrain the spin ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2009 ) may provide another way forward .",
