    "integrable one - dimensional ( 1d ) models of interacting bosons and fermions with @xmath1-function interaction @xcite have had a tremendous impact on quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular , recent breakthrough experiments on trapped ultracold bosons and fermions atoms confined to 1d have provided a better understanding of quantum statistical effects and strongly correlated phenomena in quantum many - body systems .",
    "these models contain two - body zero range potentials which allows the wavefunctions to be written as a superposition of plane waves by means of bethe s hypothesis @xcite .",
    "this assumption is true based on the fact that every particle can move freely without feeling the presence of others when no collision takes place .",
    "however , calogero @xcite showed that certain models with long range potentials can also be solved exactly , though not using bethe s hypothesis .",
    "he first solved the three - body problem with a harmonic potential and a @xmath2 potential , and then generalized it to the @xmath3-body problem to obtain the exact expression for the ground state energy and a class of excited states .",
    "sutherland @xcite then derived the exact solutions for the ground state energy , pair correlation function , low - lying excitations and thermodynamics of the model with @xmath2 potential for both fermions and bosons in the thermodynamic limit by employing the _",
    "asymptotic bethe ansatz _",
    "( aba ) which uses bethe s hypothesis in the asymptotic limit .",
    "since then , many models with non - local interaction were solved exactly through the aba method . among them",
    "are the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain @xcite , the quantum lattice model with inverse @xmath4 square potential @xcite , the @xmath5 model with long range interaction @xcite , the nonliner schrdinger model @xcite and so on .",
    "the main idea of the aba is that one restricts oneself to the asymptotic region where the particles are considered to be sufficiently far apart , such that their influence on neighboring particles is negligible @xcite .",
    "then one has to show by some unspecified method that the system is integrable , i.e. , that it has a complete set of independent integrals of motion .",
    "for example , various authors @xcite have shown that for @xmath2 potentials , one can find @xmath3 integrals of motion for the @xmath3 particle system .",
    "once this is done , one can then conclude that the wavefunction is non - diffractive and thus asymptotically given by the ba .",
    "since the exact scattering data is known , one can then obtain the exact thermodynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that a common misconception is that the aba is only a low - density approximation , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "this is not true and in fact it gives the exact thermodynamics for systems with finite density in the thermodynamic limit ( see @xcite for explanations ) .",
    "when using the aba , the low - density limit @xmath6 is only reached when the width of the interaction potential between neighboring particles become large . however , for the purpose of this investigation , we restrict ourselves to a finite density system where the width of the interaction potential between particles is small .",
    "a physical example of systems with such properties are dilute gases , whose inter - particle interactions are almost local .    in this paper , we investigate the ground state of two - component spinor bosons with finite range gaussian interactions in 1d .",
    "the interaction potential for this system can be expressed in terms of the sum of even powered derivatives of a @xmath1-function .",
    "it gives rise to certain nonlinear behaviour not observed in systems with spin - independent potentials @xcite .",
    "this kind of velocity- or state - dependent potential leads to more versatility in studying spin waves , ferromagnetic behaviour and the relation between superfluidity and magnetism in low - dimensional many - body systems , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for two - component @xmath7rb atoms on a quantum chip . by using a state - dependent",
    "dressed potential , spin degrees of freedom in two - component spinor bosons are tunable .",
    "this technique for controlling non - equilibrium spin motion allows one to study quantum coherence in interacting quantum systems , and to experimentally explore predictions of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) in a system of two - component spinor bosons .",
    "we first introduce the model in section [ model ] . in section [ integrability ] , we show that the hamiltonian for this model is integrable . in section [ groundstate ]",
    ", we derive the distribution functions for the charge and spin degrees of freedom from the aba equations .",
    "the ground state energy and thermodynamics are evaluated in section [ thermodynamics ] in the limits where the interaction strength between particles is large and the width of the interaction potential is small . in section [ local ] ,",
    "we apply the local density approximation to obtain the density profiles for this model . and",
    "finally in section [ conc ] , we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "let us consider @xmath3 bosons with @xmath0 symmetry confined to a 1d wire of length @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "here we denote the internal hyperfine spin states as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the interaction potential between adjacent particles is given by a generic non - negative function @xmath11 that is even in the inter - particle separation , i.e. , @xmath12 and vanishes at large enough distances , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "for such a system , the first quantized hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass of each boson and @xmath16 characterizes the interaction strength which is the same for all possible collisions , i.e. , between two @xmath9 bosons , two @xmath10 bosons , or one @xmath9 and one @xmath10 boson .",
    "the interactions are repulsive when @xmath17 and attractive when @xmath18 . the external magnetic field",
    "is represented by @xmath19 , and the total particle number is given by @xmath20 .",
    "for the rest of this paper we use the dimensionless units of @xmath21 for convenience .",
    "these units are also used in all figures .    in the case when @xmath22 the model can be exactly solved in the region @xmath23 where the width of the gaussian potential @xmath24 is small relative to the inter - particle separation , i.e. , @xmath25 or @xmath26 for every @xmath27 . in this limit , all particles scatter non - diffractively .",
    "this implies that the asymptotic wavefunction can be written as a sum of @xmath28 terms corresponding to the permutations @xmath29 of the set of asymptotic momenta @xmath30 .",
    "explicitly , the wavefunction can be expressed in bethe ansatz form as @xmath31    the argument that supports non - diffractive scattering is as follows .",
    "consider the two - body problem @xmath32 where the particles are far apart , i.e. , @xmath33 . since @xmath34 ,",
    "the particles behave as free particles , therefore the wavefunction is a product of plane waves with total momentum and energy given by @xmath35 through the scattering process , the total momentum and energy have to be conserved .",
    "this yields a new set of momenta which is either @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "for the @xmath3-body problem , we can think of it as a succession of two particles colliding and then scattering to the asymptotic region as free particles , where each two - body collision gives rise to a permutation of the momenta .",
    "a product of transpositions acting on the permutation @xmath29 leads to another permutation @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the scattering is non - diffractive for any number of particles .",
    "when @xmath39 in the fully polarized case , @xmath40 which allows us to recover the lieb - liniger interacting spinless bose gas @xcite .",
    "we know that in the limit @xmath41 , the gaussian function tends to the @xmath1-function .",
    "the @xmath1-function is not a function in the classical sense , and should be treated as a generalized function @xcite instead .",
    "notice that if the potential @xmath42 is an even function , its fourier transform @xmath43 is also an even function , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the taylor expansion of @xmath45 in the neighborhood of @xmath46 only consists of even powers of @xmath47 as given by @xmath48 assuming that the potential meets such restrictions , we can take the inverse fourier transform to obtain the potential in position space as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "this result is derived from the fact that the @xmath51-th derivative of the @xmath1-function can be expressed as @xmath52dk .",
    "let us now consider a gaussian type potential .",

    ", we deduce that @xmath55    it seems a little odd at first glance that an analytic function can be written in the form of an infinite sum of generalized functions .",
    "we emphasize that this equality does not hold at isolated points , i.e. , we can not , for instance , say that the equality holds at the point @xmath56 .",
    "but one can convince oneself that it holds whenever we consider @xmath42 as a continuous linear functional that associates every function @xmath57 which vanishes outside some bounded region and has continuous derivatives of all orders , a real number @xmath58 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath42 is considered a functional in the sense that @xmath59 where the integration is performed over the real line for this instance .",
    "one can also check the validity of the expansion @xmath42 in terms of a linear combination of @xmath60 , denoted as @xmath61 , when @xmath62 is the bethe ansatz wavefunction , by comparing the expressions of @xmath58 and @xmath63 . in appendix",
    "[ proof ] , we verify the claim that @xmath64 .    with this expression for the potential @xmath42 and after verifying that @xmath64 , we can re - write the hamiltonian in eq .   as @xmath65 following gutkin s work @xcite , we can show that this hamiltonian is integrable . the boundary condition imposed by eq .",

    "these are either where ( i ) the momenta of scattering particles are interchanged , or ( ii ) the momenta of scattering particles are left unchanged , with the sum of their probabilities equal to 1 .",
    "this yields the solutions for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath82    from theorem 2(b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the symmetric bethe ansatz , i.e. , bethe s hypothesis for a system of bosons , is satisfied since we have found a pair of commuting matching coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 for any matrix @xmath70 .",
    "hence we have shown that this model is ba integrable .",
    "the @xmath3 particle symmetric wavefunction can then be expressed as @xmath83 this wavefunction is a superposition of plane waves with different amplitudes @xmath84 ( not to be confused with the coefficient @xmath78 ) where @xmath29 and @xmath85 are permutations of the set of integers @xmath86 .",

    "it should be noted that the simple procedure of replacing an analytic function by a linear combination of @xmath51-th order derivatives of the @xmath1-function may lead one to think that any hamiltonian with a pairwise interaction potential which is an even function can be exactly solved via the aba .",
    "however , this is not true .",
    "the ba integrability conditions met by the gaussian function is actually quite restrictive .",
    "first of all , any non - local potential we choose has to be well - behaved , smooth and an even function .",
