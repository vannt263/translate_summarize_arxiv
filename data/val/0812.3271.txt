    "during a superoutburst , the superhump period had been believed to decrease or stay constant in su uma - type dwarf novae in general ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , although only one unambiguous sign of the increase of @xmath5 was discovered during the superoutburst of oy car @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the superhump period was explained by a shrinkage of the accretion disk ( @xcite ) , or a inward - propagation of eccentric perturbations generated at the 3:1 resonance radius in the accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , since @xcite reported that sw uma had shown an increasing trend of @xmath5 during the 1996 superoutburst , researchers have revealed that some su uma - type dwarf novae exhibit the increase of @xmath5 .",
    "such systems are mainly wz sge - type dwarf novae and su uma - type dwarf novae with short orbital periods .",
    "@xcite proposed that the accretion disk of short orbital period systems can expand beyond the 3:1 resonance radius during superoutbursts and the eccentricity wave originated at the 3:1 resonance can propagate outward .",
    "the outward - propagation of the eccentricity may lead to the phenomena of the increase of @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the increase of @xmath5 appear to be related to a low mass ratio and/or a low mass transfer rate .",
    "recently , @xcite classified superoutbursts of su uma - type dwarf novae based on the mass ratio ( @xmath17 ) and disk radius , and showed that a system with a large mass ratio ( @xmath18 ) can exhibit two types of superoutburst .",
    "following this idea , @xcite explained the behavior of the superoutbursts of tv crv .",
    "they proposed that the changing of @xmath5 ( @xmath19 ) depends on whether a superoutburst has a precursor or not .",
    "their interpretation is indicated below : if a large amount of matter is accumulated beyond the 3:1 resonance radius at the outburst maximum , the dammed matter prevents the disk from rapid cooling , leading to a superoutburst without a precursor . in this case , the eccentricity originated at the 3:1 resonance radius can propagate outward , and @xmath5 can increase during the superoutburst .",
    "further , the discovery of the infrared excess observed in the late stage of wz sge - type superoutburst also supports their interpretation for the changing of @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in asas 1600 , the @xmath5 changed more complexly than had been documented .",
    "figure [ o - c ] represents an @xmath8 diagram for the timings of the superhump maxima listed in table [ maxtime ] . as we mentioned in section [ sh ] , in the middle part ( around @xmath11 ) , the @xmath8 diagram demonstrates an increasing trend of @xmath5 , and the @xmath5 derivative between @xmath12 is @xmath14 days cycle@xmath3 .",
    "however , in the early ( around @xmath9 ) and the last part ( around @xmath10 ) , the @xmath8 diagram shows a decreasing trend of @xmath5 . some well observed su uma stars , e.g. al com ( @xcite , @xcite ) , hv vir ( @xcite ) and tt boo ( @xcite ) , showed an @xmath8 diagram with the same trend as that of asas 1600 .",
    "these systems seem to follow the general tendency pointed out by @xcite .",
    "they investigated the @xmath8 diagrams of some su uma - type dwarf novae , and proposed that almost all su uma - type dwarf novae show the decrease of @xmath5 both at the beginning and at the end of the superoutburst , but the increasing trend at the middle phase .",
    "we listed su uma - type dwarf novae which show an increase of @xmath5 so far ( table [ positivepdot ] ) . because we judged from the shape of the @xmath8 diagram",
    ", they include systems which have not been regarded as such .",
    "we reexamined them , and found that most of the well observed su uma - type dwarf novae with an increase of @xmath5 also show a decrease of @xmath5 at the beginning or end stage , or both .",
    "this also supports the claim by @xcite .",
    "asas 1600 showed a regrowth of the ordinary superhumps in the amplitude like well investigated systems with an increase of @xmath5 as described in the previous section . on hjd 2453535 , the superhump amplitude became @xmath20 mag at the first maximum .",
    "after that , it gradually diminished , and reached @xmath21 mag on hjd 2453539 .",
    "however , the superhump amplitude regrew up to the second maximum of @xmath22 mag on hjd 2453540 , thereafter , it gradually became smaller again .",
    "additionally , from figure [ shamp ] and [ o - c ] , we found that the superhump period decreased when the superhump amplitude reached to the first maximum , successively gradually increased until the second maximum of the amplitude , and finally decreased again during the 2005 superoutburst of asas 1600 .",
    "the correlation between the amplitude and the period of the superhumps can be found in most su uma - type dwarf novae which show an increase of @xmath5 ( see the systems listed in table [ positivepdot ] with both @xmath23 and @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the regrowth of the superhump amplitude have a close relation to the increase of @xmath5 , and most su uma - type dwarf novae with a superhump regrowth may follow the same evolution of the ordinary superhump as asas 1600 .",
    "the statement about the superhump period by @xcite seems to be applicable to such systems .",
    "rz lmi , however , showed only a gradual increase of the superhump period during the whole course of the 2004 april superoutburst , and this star does not seem to follow our scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "rz lmi is an er uma - type star , which is the most active subgroup of su uma - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "the superhumps in er uma stars have been pointed out to be somewhat different from typical ones in normal su uma stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and @xcite suggested that the extreme superoutburst properties of rz lmi can not be simply explained in the frame of the thermal - tidal instability model . we may need a different scheme to rightly interpret the superhump evolution in er uma stars .    anyway , the relation between the amplitude and the period of ordinary superhumps can be a key point for an understanding of the evolution of accretion disks during a superoutburst , and observations focused on them are required for the future .",
    "the double - peaked humps were discovered with a period very close to the orbital period in the early stage of the 2005 superoutburst of asas 1600 ( paper i ) , and , therefore , this object was identified as a promising candidate of wz sge - type dwarf novae . in 2006 may ,",
    "the next year of the superoutburst , normal outburst of asas 1600 was observed by r. stubbings with @xmath26 ( vsnet - outburst 6880 ) , which seems to contradict the property ( 3 ) of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "however , al com , one of the established wz sge - type dwarf novae , also have undergone some normal outbursts ( in 1961 , 1965 , 1974 , 1975 , and possibly 1976 ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) , hence , the wz sge - type identification of asas 1600 can not judged to be wrong only by this point .",
    "@xcite proposed that , in wz sge - type dwarf novae with an extremely small mass ratio ( @xmath17 ) , the 2:1 resonance can be strong enough to suppress the outward - propagation of the eccentricity originated at the 3:1 resonance and , therefore , the @xmath5 is almost constant . on the other hand , in systems with a similar or slightly larger @xmath27 , such as rz leo ( @xcite ) , bc uma ( @xcite ) and some su uma - type stars , the outward - propagation of the eccentricity is not restricted and , therefore , the @xmath5 can be increase . in paper",
    "i , using an empirical relation ( @xcite ) , authors estimated the mass ratio of asas 1600 to be @xmath28 which is slightly large , compared with that of the typical wz sge - type dwarf novae . in section [ sh ] , we determined the @xmath19 of asas 1600 to be @xmath29 days cycle@xmath3 . based on the idea by @xcite , these results indicate that asas 1600 is a system with a weak 2:1 resonance .",
