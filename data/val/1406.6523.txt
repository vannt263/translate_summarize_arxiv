    "here we consider a version of the lh model defined over a 2d regular cartesian grid with nearest - neighbor connectivity over which a scalar field @xmath4 is defined .",
    "the superscript @xmath5 is a discrete time index , and the subscript pair @xmath6 identifies a single node on the 2d lattice . keeping @xmath7 on the lattice boundaries , the cellular automaton is driven by adding one small increment in @xmath8 per time step , at some randomly selected node that changes from one time step to the next . a deterministic stability criterion is defined in terms of the local curvature of the field at node @xmath6 : @xmath9 where the sum runs over the four nearest neighbors at nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "if this quantity exceeds some preset threshold @xmath12 then an amount of nodal variable @xmath13 is redistributed to the same four nearest neighbors according to the following discrete , deterministic rules : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "following this redistribution it is possible that one of the nearest - neighbor nodes now exceeds the stability threshold .",
    "the redistribution process begins anew from this node , and so on in classical avalanching manner .",
    "driving is suspended during avalanching , implicitly implying a separation of timescales between driving and avalanching dynamics , and all nodal values are updated synchronously during avalanche to avoid introducing a directional bias in avalanche propagation .",
    "it is readily shown that these redistribution rules , while conservative in @xmath16 , lead to a decrease in @xmath17 summed over the five nodes involved by an amount : @xmath18 with the energy released being `` assigned '' to the unstable node @xmath6 . if one identifies @xmath17 with a measure of magnetic energy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the total energy liberated by all unstable nodes at a given iteration is then equated to the energy release per unit time in the flare . a natural energy unit here ( used for normalization in all that follows ) , is the quantity of energy @xmath19 liberated by a single node exceeding the stability threshold by an infinitesimal amount .",
    "this very simple model yields a good representation of flare statistics , namely the observed power - law form ( and associated exponents ) of the frequency distributions of flare peak energy release @xmath20 , duration @xmath21 , and total energy release @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "this model is known to generate a double power - law frequency distribution of avalanche parameters e , p and t , with a steeper power law for the smaller events @xcite .",
    "then , they introduced a modified driving scheme @xcite using a power - low random number generator for the small increments of @xmath8 .",
    "the increments follow the probability distribution @xmath22 they showed that the power law indexes of the avalanche parameters e , p and t vary roughly linearly with the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "this method provides a very interesting mean of controlling the power - law indexes of soc models .",
    "we choose , for the present study , to retain only this modified driving scheme  leaving out the anisotropic stability criterion and redistribution rules  from the complete original gv model .",
    "in addition to the gv model , @xcite also developed a modified driving scheme by rendering it non - stationary .",
    "this work was motivated initially by the results of @xcite , who showed that the waiting time distribution of solar flares should be characterized by a power - law tail for long waiting times , rather than by an exponential decay which is obtained from the lh model .",
    "finally , @xcite re - analyzed the solar flare data from various source and concluded that the waiting time distribution of solar flares is indeed consistent with a non - stationary poisson process , and can well be described with an avalanche model possessing a non - stationary driver .",
    "a biased driving scheme could in principle make the model either more or less robust with respect to various random number sequences , and hence improve or decrease its predictive capabilities . in order to simplify the discussion we only detail the results obtained with the gv model in this work .",
    "similar analysis made with the model of @xcite lead to the same conclusions regarding its predictive capabilities ( not shown here ) . in the following we use a gv model with a parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the random driver of the lh and gv models can be nicely linked to the parker picture of random shuffling of a loop s magnetic footpoint by photospheric flows . for loop diameters smaller than this scale ,",
    "though , the granular flow displaces the footpoints in a spatially coherent manner far removed from random shuffling .",
    "one particularly interesting form of such global forcing is a twisting of the loop s footpoints , which then propagates upwards and accumulates along the length of the loop .",
    "this form of global forcing has a direct equivalent in our 2d cellular automaton @xcite through the driving rule @xmath25 where the parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is a measure of the driving rate . as in the lh model , driving is interrupted during avalanching , which amounts to assuming that the driving timescale is much longer than the avalanching timescale , a reasonable assumption in the solar coronal context ( for a discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "the stochastic component of the deterministically driven model can appear in the threshold definition , in the extraction or in the redistribution rule .",
    "in all rules discussed so far , redistribution is conservative , in that whatever quantity of @xmath16 being extracted from an unstable node ends up in the nearest neighbors .",
    "this conservation property is basically inspired by the sandpile analogy , where avalanches redistribute sand grains without creating or destroying any .",
    "a nonconservative version of the lh redistribution rules can be defined as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] is again extracted from a uniform distribution of random deviates with a lower bound @xmath30 , such as @xmath31 is the fraction of the redistributed quantity @xmath13 that is lost rather than redistributed .",
    "this rule thus involves one free parameter , namely the conservation parameter @xmath320,1[$ ] .",
    "a nonconservative model of this type , using fully deterministic driving , and random redistribution and stability criteria , has been studied extensively in @xcite .",

    "model d1 corresponds to model nc6 in @xcite and includes random extraction , random redistribution and random non - conservation components .",
    "model d2 corresponds to model nc0 , which involves only one type of stochastic process located in the non - conservative redistribution rule ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "the heavy - tail part of the pdf directly derives from this latter property and is obtained only for a few favorable random number sequences , while the stochastic process is strong enough to severely alter the mean prediction towards the climatological forecast ( vertical solid gray line ) .",
    "we clearly see that this property of the stochastic process is very strong in the lh and gv , and significantly weaker in models d. hence , the gaussian shape obtained in the d models simply indicative of marginal dependency upon the random number sequence : very large avalanche are triggered only when the adequate stress pattern exists in the lattice .",
    "the left panels reveal another fundamental difference  in the context of predictability  between the models we considered .",
    "the lh and gv models show pdfs of @xmath48 spanning the whole time window , which means that the stochastic process determines when the largest avalanche will occur in the next time window .",
    "hence , a mean @xmath48 is generally hard to define , although with some particular initial condition a slight peak value can be observed ( not shown here ) .",

    "the assimilation technique succeeds in capturing the two clusters of flares exceeding c8 at @xmath61 and @xmath62 hr , without generating spurious ( @xmath63 c8 ) flares before , after , or in between .",
    "the energy levels of the four reproduced flares also match very well with observations .",
    "the details of this assimilation technique will be described in details in @xcite .",
    "these preliminary results suggest that the lattice configuration resulting from the data assimilation run combined with the predictive capabilities of the model we demonstrated in this work could be used to carry out quantitative predictions of solar flares through direct simulation .",
    "we believe that such a model could lead to significant improvements of the current predictions of large ( typically x - class ) solar flares .    @xmath64 @xmath65 range during the flaring events of the active region 1045 between february 6 and february 9 , 2010 .",
    "the top panel show the goes flux ( blue ) and the processed signal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( black ) for flares of class c8 and above .",
    "the bottom panel shows the goes signal ( grey boxes ) used in the data assimilation run . the assimilated sequence ( da ) is shown in red along with three random realizations of the model in orange , green and magenta .",
