    "one of the defining features of any hadron are its quark and gluon ( or generically , parton ) momentum distributions .",

    "information from the drell - yan reaction in @xmath1 scattering has also been used to determine pdfs of the pion .",
    "theoretically , the operator product expansion ( ope ) in qcd allows one to isolate the soft , non - perturbative pdfs from the hard , perturbatively calculable scattering processes .",
    "this factorization property gives rise to a universal set of pdfs which can be used to describe various reactions . because pdfs parameterize the interactions of quarks and gluons in the hadron over all distance scales , they are sensitive to the dynamics of qcd in the strong coupling regime  _ i.e. _ , at scales @xmath2 .",
    "the only rigorous theoretical approach currently capable of calculating observables in the non - perturbative regime from first principles is lattice qcd .",
    "the first exploratory studies of pdfs on the lattice were made almost two decades ago.@xcite advances in computing power have recently enabled dedicated simulations to be undertaken which for the first time can be directly compared with phenomenology.@xcite since the numerical simulations are performed in euclidean space - time , it is not possible to compute the pdfs directly as a function of the light - cone momentum fraction , @xmath0 ( pdfs are formally defined as light - cone correlation functions involving currents with space - time separation @xmath3 ) . on the other hand , using the ope one can formally express the _ moments _ of pdfs in terms of matrix elements of local operators between hadron states .",
    "these matrix elements can be calculated numerically on the lattice .    despite the impressive recent progress in the numerical simulations ,",
    "several approximations are still necessary in order to relate the lattice moments to experiment .",
    "firstly , since space - time is discretized on the lattice , with some finite lattice spacing @xmath4 , the results must be extrapolated to the continuum limit , @xmath5 .",
    "the finite number of lattice sites also means that an extrapolation to the infinite volume limit is necessary to avoid omitting important physics arising from the long - range part of the nucleon wave function .",
    "in addition , since the computational cost of simulations scales with the quark mass roughly as @xmath6 , current lattice simulations are performed with unphysically large masses for @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks , typically @xmath9  mev , so that an extrapolation to physical masses , @xmath10  mev , is essential.@xcite    the chiral ( @xmath11 ) extrapolation is found to play a particularly vital role in understanding the connection between the lattice results and phenomenology .",
    "whereas the lattice simulations yield results@xcite for the moments of unpolarized quark distributions in the nucleon which are typically 50% larger than experiment when extrapolated linearly to @xmath12 , inclusion of the non - linear dependence on @xmath11 arising from the long - range structure of the nucleon removes most of the discrepancy.@xcite furthermore , significant finite volume effects have been found@xcite in the calculation of the axial vector charge @xmath13 , which may eventually explain the residual discrepancy between the extrapolated lattice value and experiment .    in this mini - review we focus on the challenges involved with extrapolating the lattice data from the currently accessible regions of parameter space to the physical region . using constraints available from chiral effective theory , in sec .  2 we review extrapolation formulas which seek to describe the lattice data over a large range of quark masses , and in the chiral limit .",

    "the more ambitious task of reconstructing the @xmath0 dependence of pdfs from a finite number of moments is discussed in sec .",
    "because of the small number of lattice moments available , only valence distributions can be analyzed at present ; sea quark distributions await future lattice data on higher moments of pdfs which are necessary for an independent determination of the valence and sea components . finally , in sec .",

    "the moments of parton distributions in the nucleon are formally defined as @xmath14\\ , \\label{mom : unp }                                  \\\\ %    \\langle x^n \\rangle_{\\delta q } & = & \\int_0 ^ 1 dx\\ ,    x^n\\ [ \\delta q(x)+(-1)^n \\delta \\bar   q(x)]\\ , \\label{mom : hel }                                  \\\\ %    \\langle x^n \\rangle_{\\delta q } & = & \\int_0 ^ 1 dx\\ ,    x^n\\ [ \\delta q(x)-(-1)^n \\delta \\bar q(x ) ] \\ , , \\label{mom : trans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the spin - averaged , helicity and transversity distributions , respectively . from their definition , the moments alternate between the total ( @xmath15 ) and valence ( @xmath16 ) distributions , depending on whether @xmath17 is even or odd .",
    "using the ope , these moments can be related to ground state hadron matrix elements of specific twist - two operators,@xcite which are calculated on the lattice .    in this review",
    "we focus not on the details of the lattice simulations of the moments ( a comprehensive survey of results was recently given by the authors@xcite ) , but on their physical interpretation . in particular , we examine the consequences of chiral symmetry for the extrapolation of pdf moments to physical values of the quark mass , @xmath11 .",

    "this was later confirmed in @xmath18pt , where the coefficients of these terms were also calculated , both for the nucleon,@xcite and for the pion.@xcite using these constraints , a low order chiral expansion for the moments of the pdfs was developed recently by detmold _",

    "direct comparison of the currently available lattice moments of nucleon pdfs with phenomenological ones is non - trivial .",
    "the lattice moments in general receive contributions from diagrams in which the local operator insertions are on quark lines which are connected to the nucleon source , as well as those where the operator acts on a quark loop in the vacuum , which is connected only by gluon lines to the quark lines originating in the nucleon source . obtaining a signal from the latter , so - called `` disconnected graphs ''",
    "is extremely difficult on the lattice , as recent studies@xcite of the strangeness form factors of the nucleon have shown , and to date only the connected contributions to the lattice pdf moments have been computed .",
    "fortunately , the near degeneracy of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 quark masses , which makes charge symmetry such a good symmetry of nature , means that the disconnected diagrams cancel very precisely in the isovector difference between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 pdfs of the proton .",
    "an unambiguous comparison of the connected isovector pdf lattice moments can therefore be made with the analogous experimental moments .",

    "that is , for the polarized moments the chiral non - analytic behavior produces far less curvature as one approaches the physical pion mass than in the unpolarized case .",

    "the origin of the strong lattice volume dependence of @xmath13 is likely related to the fact that the pion field does not vanish before it meets the lattice boundary.@xcite however , there is another important issue to consider when it comes to the curvature that we have been discussing with regard to the chiral extrapolation problem .",
    "one would really like to see confirmation of this curvature as the lattice calculations are continued to smaller pion mass and eventually use these calculations to determine the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "this is difficult for two reasons .",
    "first , the chiral coefficients are smaller in quenched simulations ( which are numerically less demanding ) , and so the curvature may not be observable until very low masses are reached . secondly , even in the case of full qcd the chiral behavior , which is an infrared property of qcd , can be severely altered by working on a finite volume .    for an accurate estimate of the effect of a finite lattice volume on the chiral loops one should replace the continuum momentum integrals in the chiral expansion by finite sums over the allowed momenta on the lattice  as already done for baryon and vector meson masses.@xcite a full presentation of the results of such an approach will be given elsewhere.@xcite for the present we note that the main consequence of a finite volume is to effectively impose a lower limit on the pion momentum integral .",

    "they will also require an accurate knowledge of moments with @xmath94 and evaluation of disconnected contributions .",
    "with such a program we could expect significant advances in our understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon ( and other hadrons ) over the next few years .",
    "in particular , we look forward to determinations of the various sea and transversity distributions",
    ". the methods reviewed here will also prove useful in extracting generalized parton distributions from recent lattice calculations@xcite of non - forward matrix elements of the various twist-2 operators .",
