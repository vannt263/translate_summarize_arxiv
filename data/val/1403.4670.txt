    "in contrast , few results of quantized control are generalized to switched systems in spite of a wide range of their applications .",
    "recently , based on the results in @xcite for a single mode , liberzon  @xcite has developed an encoding and control strategy achieving the global asymptotic stability of sampled - data switched systems with quantized state feedback .",

    "feedback has not yet explored .",
    "here we consider a continuous - time switching linear system , whose quantized outputs and switching signal are transmitted to the controller at all times .",
    "the objective of this paper is to extend the encoding method of @xcite for non - switched systems .",
    "the key point of the earlier studies is that certain level sets of a lyapunov function are invariant regions .",
    "the difficulty of switched systems is that such level sets change at every switching time .",
    "therefore , at the `` zooming - in '' stage , non - switched systems require only periodic reduction of the `` zoom '' parameter of quantizers , whereas in switched systems , we need to adjust the parameter after each switch .",
    "we assume that the average dwell time  @xcite of the switching signal is large enough , and develop an output encoding for global asymptotic stabilization by using multiple lyapunov functions .",

    "in this section , we first define switched systems and construct quantizers and controllers based on the non - switched case in @xcite . next we present the main result , theorem [ thm : stability_theorem ] .",
