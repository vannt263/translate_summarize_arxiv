    "complex networks have emerged as an area of intense research activity in recent times .",
    "this is because they provide an effective framework for representing and modelling many types of phenomena occurring in complex systems .",
    "such complex systems arise in several diverse areas , ranging from neuronal systems to social sciences @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the evolution of the network and hence the emergence of collective behaviour depend both on the nodal dynamics and the network structure or the topology of the connectivity among the nodes .",
    "earlier studies were mainly on static networks where the topology remains the same but dynamics at the nodes evolve under the topology giving rise to interesting dynamics like synchronization , clusters , amplitude death etc @xcite .",
    "recent reports indicate how rewiring mechanisms , where the topology is repeatedly changed , can enhance the richness of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that nodal dynamics and topology are equally important in real world situations and their interplay can lead to interesting results .",
    "a well defined network structure is often an important feature whose evolution can affect relevant biological processes . at the same time",
    ", the topology of connections obviously plays a role in information processing , spreading of diseases etc .",
    "however most of the network growth methods reported , do not rely on nodal dynamics , but depends on structural changes alone to produce desired results @xcite .",
    "several cases of synchrony and phase locking can be found in central nervous system and the resultant coherent activity plays an important role in behaviour and cognition . in this context ,",
    "phase locked cluster oscillations are observed in periodically forced neuronal networks and also in networks with coupling of inhibitory and excitatory nature@xcite .",
    "also it is reported how a fully synchronised single cluster breaks into two anti phase clusters due to phase resetting controls@xcite .",
    "co existent clustered states depending on initial conditions are shown to arise with inhibitory coupling@xcite .",
    "thus it is important to understand the mechanism responsible for the formation of phase locked clusters and other possible network structures and the role of nodal dynamics in stabilising them .    in this paper , we report how periodic attachment or removal of links based on a chosen strategy can establish coherent structures in a complex network .",
    "these emerge as the network evolves under both nodal dynamics and the proposed connectivity changes .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that real world networks often evolve with changes in topology in which links can appear or disappear as the whole system evolves .",
    "this is especially relevant in biological and social networks where contacts between systems are not constantly realised but occasionally activated @xcite",
    ". such strategic evolution of topology is shown to result in favourable outcomes in social networks @xcite .",
    "it is reported that activity dependent interactions in a network of phase oscillators can induce coherent state , two cluster state , and chaotic state @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the context of fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) oscillators , rewiring the interaction pattern will induce collective firing @xcite such that lack of connectivity is compensated by dynamic rewiring @xcite .",
    "so also , adaptive coupling to enhance synchrony has been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the interplay between dynamics and topology is highly relevant in deriving dynamical criticality and optimal properties . along these lines ,",
    "several evolutionary design algorithms have been introduced for coupled phase oscillators @xcite .",
    "it is also reported how functional sub networks can be evolved according to the network structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that rewiring or dynamic evolution enhances the scope and applicability of networks and result in interesting and richer dynamical states .    in our method",
    "we follow a strategic growth of the network where connectivity changes are done periodically using a condition that is based on relative performance as governed by the dynamics at the nodes .",
    "this method , while changing the total links at every re wiring , finally drives the topology to stable states and thus provides a very simple mechanism for growing networks and stabilising them to different topologies .",
    "we illustrate this in networks with fhn neuronal model as nodal dynamics . starting from a very sparse network ,",
    "we show how selective removal and adding of links based on this specific strategy can result in phase locked clusters in which nodes in each cluster are in almost synchrony , but are phase locked with nodes of the other cluster .",
    "it is interesting to see a stable bipartite structure emerging under such an evolution with two clusters anti phase to each other .",
    "moreover the specific strategy chosen here leads to a structure in which there are no links among synchronised nodes in the same cluster but all to all connections between the nodes in different clusters .",
    "we consider a large number of realisations with different starting initial conditions to establish that such an emergent topology is preferred by the system under the strategy used by us .",
    "we indicate how to establish the stability of the resultant topology , its dependence on the parameters in the design of the strategy and the role of nodal dynamics in this scheme .",
    "we consider the fitzhugh nagumo ( fhn ) neuron model as the nodal dynamics in our study .",
    "it is widely used to study the dynamics of neurons especially neuronal synchronization and desynchronization phenomena in the brain .",
    "the intrinsic dynamics of fhn systems is modelled by the following equation , @xmath0 here , @xmath1 represents the voltage of the neuron and @xmath2 represents the recovery variable .",
    "the variations in the voltage represent the spikes observed in neurons .",
    "this system also can represent the dynamics of any excitable system since it has two time scales , which can be controlled by choosing appropriate values for the parameter @xmath3 .    in the study reported in this paper",
    ", we consider a dynamic network of @xmath4 such fhn neurons coupled as @xmath5 the strength of diffusive coupling is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the network topology is decided by the elements the adjacency matrix @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , the neurons @xmath9 and @xmath10 share a link .",
    "we choose the matrix @xmath7 to be symmetric @xmath11 such that all couplings are bidirectional .",
    "further , self - couplings are avoided by choosing @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce a strategy for evolving the system in which in addition to the dynamical evolution of the nodes , a new network topology is selected after a rewiring time of @xmath13 .",
    "it is linked with nodal dynamics such that the strategy depends on the co - performance of nodes as indicated by the suitably defined distance between them in phase space .",
    "thus the rewiring is based on local information on nodes and not on global measures like order parameter or total number of links etc . to quantify this",
    ", we define the distance function between a pair of nodes , @xmath14 as the euclidean distance in phase space between them given by @xmath15 ( clearly @xmath16 ) .",
    "the steps involved in the strategic evolution of the network are as follows .    1 .",
    "start with a very sparse network of @xmath4 systems 2 .",
    "after a rewiring time of @xmath13 , check the value of @xmath14 at very pair of nodes .",
    "3 .   if @xmath17 , a chosen threshold , attach a link between @xmath9 and @xmath10 by setting @xmath8 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath18 , detach the link between @xmath9 and @xmath10 by setting @xmath19 . 5 .   repeat steps @xmath20@xmath21 after very time interval @xmath13 .    thus in a way",
    "the matrix @xmath7 itself is also co evolving with the nodal dynamics . here , the network is potentially global , which means that , any neuron can get connected to any other neuron , based only on the euclidean distance between them .",
    "the evolution is continued till the network topology stabilises . in the next section",
    ", we present the detailed analysis on the topological states of the network that result from the evolution scheme introduced .",
    "the analysis is done numerically by using the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 such that the intrinsic dynamics is periodic spiking . the typical reset time is chosen to be @xmath24 while the coupling strength is varied from @xmath25 to @xmath26 and the threshold is varied from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . for the numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ eq : fhn_net ] , we use adams - bashforth - moulton predictor - corrector method @xcite .",
    "we consider ten fhn neurons in random topology evolving under the strategy we have introduced . from numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ eq : fhn_net ] starting from random topology and random initial conditions , we find that , for certain initial conditions the systems stabilize to a @xmath20-clustered state for suitable values of coupling strength .",
    "the time series from all the nodes for this state is shown in fig .",

    "it is clear that five of the nodes are in synchrony and are in anti phase with the remaining five nodes .",
    "thus this is a 2 cluster network with five nodes in each .",
    "as the network topology evolves with the system dynamics , it stabilizes to a bipartite structure with nodes in different clusters forming two groups . due to the specific strategy chosen",
    ", there is no connection among the nodes in synchrony within a cluster while all pairs of nodes from different clusters are connected .",
    "the resulting network structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart_example ] .     a representation of the stable bipartite network .",
    "blue and red nodes form two different groups ( clusters ) . here , both clusters have @xmath31 nodes each . note that there is no two blue nodes ( and no two red nodes ) share a link and that all pairs of blue and red nodes are connected . ]    the corresponding adjacency matrix is shown in fig .",

    "note that rows @xmath33,@xmath20,@xmath31,@xmath34 and @xmath35 are similar and that rows @xmath36,@xmath21,@xmath37,@xmath38 and @xmath39 are similar .",
    "this corresponds to the cluster structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart_example ] . ]",
    "we proceed with the numerical study by choosing large number of different initial conditions and find that , different types of bipartite networks ( @xmath31 & @xmath31 , @xmath21 & @xmath34 , @xmath36 & @xmath37 , @xmath20 & @xmath38 and @xmath33 & @xmath39 ) are possible for different sets of initial conditions in phase space .",
    "we use the term @xmath20-cluster state to refer to all these states collectively .",
    "there are also some initial conditions that evolve into a single cluster or a @xmath33-cluster state , with all the systems in almost synchrony and the resulting topology is a set of disconnected nodes . by almost synchrony we mean ,",
    "as mentioned in @xcite the difference in the firing times of two systems is less than ten @xmath40 of their inter spike interval .",
    "these different topological states therefore multi stable states of the system .",
    "to identify all the possible resultant network topologies , we first find the number of clusters ( number of clusters for a bipartite network is @xmath20 , for a tri - partite network is @xmath36 etc . ) from the adjacency matrix as described below .",
    "then we find the number of systems in each cluster from the total links in the evolved topology .",
    "as mentioned above , the systems which are synchronized among each other are not connected and the corresponding elements in the adjacency matrix are zeroes ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath8 then , systems at nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not synchronized and thus , belong to different clusters .",
    "this means that , the number of clusters in each topology can be identified as the number of unique rows in the adjacency matrix . for example , in the adjacency matrix shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart_example_adj ] , we find that there are only two unique rows ( or columns , since the matrix is symmetric ) namely , row-@xmath33 and row-@xmath36 .",
    "all other rows are replicas of these two unique rows .",
    "thus , we identify the network represented by the adjacency matrix shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart_example_adj ] as bipartite .",
    "the @xmath33-cluster can also be identified as the network with number of links , @xmath42 .",
    "as noted earlier , all pairs of nodes in different clusters are connected to each other .",
    "thus , the number of links in a @xmath20-clustered state of ( @xmath33 & @xmath39 ) can be estimated to be @xmath39 , since the only node in the first cluster is connected to all @xmath39 nodes in the second cluster , and no two nodes in second cluster share a link .",
    "similarly , ( @xmath20 & @xmath38 ) clustered state has @xmath43 links , ( @xmath36 & @xmath37 ) clustered state has @xmath44 links , ( @xmath21 & @xmath34 ) clustered state has @xmath45 links , and ( @xmath31 & @xmath31 ) clustered state has @xmath46 links . in the case of @xmath36-clustered states the number of unique rows in the adjacency matrix is found to be @xmath36 .",
    "the number of links in a @xmath36-cluster state of ( @xmath33 , @xmath33 & @xmath38 ) can be estimated to be @xmath47 , since the only nodes in first two clusters make one link with each other and @xmath38 nodes each with the third cluster .",
    "similarly , ( @xmath33 , @xmath20 & @xmath37 ) clustered state has @xmath48 links , ( @xmath33,@xmath36 & @xmath34 ) clustered state has @xmath49 links , ( @xmath33 , @xmath21 & @xmath31 ) clustered state has @xmath50 links , ( @xmath20 , @xmath20 & @xmath34 ) clustered state has @xmath51 links , ( @xmath20 , @xmath36 & @xmath31 ) clustered state has @xmath52 links , ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 & @xmath21 ) clustered state has @xmath53 links and ( @xmath36 , @xmath36 & @xmath21 ) clustered state has @xmath54 links .",
    "thus , each resultant topology can be identified from the number of unique rows in the adjacency matrix and the number of links .",
    "as we have noted earlier , we find our method results in multi stable topological states depending on their initial states .",
    "it is to be noted that by initial state we mean both the starting topology and the initial conditions in phase space for the nodes .",
    "the number of systems in each cluster or the variety of possible clusters also depends on initial starting states . to establish the multi stability and to get a comprehensive picture of stabilised topologies , we consider @xmath55 realisations of the nodal states and evolve them based on the method described in the previous section .",
    "for each stable @xmath33-cluster and @xmath20-cluster topology , we calculate the frequency of occurrence defined as , frequency = number of occurrences of a certain topology / total number of initial conditions .",
    "this can be understood as the probability of occurrence of each stable topology .",

    "it is important to study the temporal dynamics in relation to spatial patterns . here",
    "we present a very simple evolutionary strategy that can utilise the mutual effect of spatial and temporal factors to stabilise a particular topology in the network .",
    "the dynamic evolution studied is based on a rewiring scheme derived from local information on the co - performance of adjacent nodes .",
    "we find this facilitates the formation of bipartite structure with two phase locked clusters in addition to a prevalent single cluster .",
    "we analyse the probability of occurrence of different possible bipartite topologies in a given network for specific chosen values of the parameters . considering the relevant parameters involved in the process as @xmath65 , @xmath13 and @xmath6 , we study in detail the effect of varying them on the final stabilised topology .",
    "some of the important results and conclusions are given below .",
    "for large value of @xmath6 , the single cluster is mostly preferred , while smaller values of @xmath6 lead to bipartite and even tripartite topologies . for large value of the threshold @xmath65 ,",
    "switching between topologies occur .",
    "there is an optimal range of @xmath65 in which almost all initial conditions lead to topological fixed points .",
    "the dynamics at the nodes has a role to play in the evolution of fixed topology . in a network of same systems without any strategy",
    "also phase locked clusters are possible .",
    "what the strategy does is to drive the network to a stable topology and keep it there without any links within a cluster . in the limiting case of two systems , we find the strategy can change anti",
    "- phase to in - phase and vice versa .",
    "this means strategy can induce a tendency to settle to definite topologies .",
    "conceptually , we feel the topology to which the network stabilises is similar to stable fixed point in dynamical systems . accordingly",
    ", we establish the stability by considering small perturbations from the stable or fixed point topology .",
    "even though multi stability for dynamical states have been reported for networks and other coupled systems , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time multi stability in topology is studied in detail .",
    "the homogeneous model of network studied to establish the growth of phase locked clusters may not capture all the complexities of neuronal dynamics or real world networks .",
    "however , it opens up the possibility of keeping the emergent state of a network in synchronization without any instantaneous links between their nodes but by keeping a strategy alive .",
    "also the state is really robust since the moment small perturbations or noise arise due to external effects etc .",
    "the strategy will become active and change topology accordingly to retain the synchronization .",
    "this need based re wiring can be optimised for minimum energy expenditure in engineering systems or real world networks with possible biological justifications .",
    "emergence of bipartite structure is interesting and is concurrent with the presence of motifs with fan like structure in the network .",
    "usually bi partite networks are considered in relation to two different types of nodes .",
    "here we show how bipartite nature emerges by dynamic evolution from a single type of nodes .",
    "this can be considered as an extreme case of the conventional bi partites .",
    "it is well established that self organised structures can emerge from a collection of interacting elements .",
    "the study reported here confirms that a strategy based dynamic evolution can drive the system to definite structures and stabilised topologies .",
    "thus this provides one more instance that the co - evolution of dynamics and topology can naturally determine the network properties .",
    "we are aware that the procedure reported here needs further extensions to make it strictly applicable to real world situations .",
    "one way to do this is to introduce a probability in making and breaking of connections .",
    "the work related to these issues is already in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
