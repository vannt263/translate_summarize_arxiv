    "the successful description of relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and at the lhc in terms of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics ( for a recent review see @xcite ) has brought a lot of attention to studies aiming at the construction of the most adequate hydrodynamic framework .",
    "one way to achieve this task is to compare the results of various hydrodynamic approaches @xcite , which differ by the number of terms included in the formalism and by the values of the transport coefficients , with the results of the underlying microscopic kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "the latter is very often used as a staring point to derive the specific form of the evolution equations of relativistic hydrodynamics , however , several approximations done in such procedures may result in differences between the predictions of the kinetic theory and the hydrodynamic models constructed directly with its help .",
    "as a lot of work has been already done in this context for simple ( i.e. , one - component ) fluids , the analysis of mixtures has been so far quite limited @xcite , for some recent developments see  @xcite .",
    "one of the problems of the previous approaches using the concept of anisotropic hydrodynamics  @xcite was that they were based only on the zeroth and first moments of the kinetic equations . assuming that the distribution functions used in anisotropic hydrodynamics are described by the original romatschke - strickland form  @xcite , one finds underdetermined set of equations , where the number of unknown parameters is larger than the number of equations .",
    "consequently , to close the system of equations , in refs .",
    "@xcite the transverse - momentum scale parameters for quarks and gluons were taken to be equal  .    in this work",
    "we develop the approach presented in refs .",
    "we use the zeroth , first , as well as the second moments of the kinetic equations for quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "this allows us to use the romatschke - strickland form with more independent parameters as compared to the previous works .",
    "our selection of the equations will be presented and discussed in greater detail below .",
    "here we only mention that our equations include the baryon number and energy - momentum conservation laws .",
    "this is achieved by the use of the two types of the landau matching condition : the first one fixes the effective chemical potential @xmath0 , while the second one ( more commonly used ) fixes the effective temperature @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we use a special combination of equations coming from the second moment which guarantees the agreement with the israel - stewart theory for the system approaching local equilibrium  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "our approach is restricted to the one - dimensional , boost invariant systems  @xcite , denoted below as ( 0 + 1)d systems .",
    "we show that the evolution equations of anisotropic hydrodynamics for quark and gluon fluids derived herein yield good agreement with the results of the kinetic theory .",
    "several options for the selection of the zeroth moment equations have been studied and the best choice is indicated .",
    "the new approach eliminates solutions with exponentially damped anisotropy parameters , found in  @xcite , which do not agree with the kinetic - theory solutions  @xcite .",
    "such solutions appeared in the cases where the initial conditions corresponded to oblate - prolate or prolate - prolate initial quark and gluon momentum distribution functions .",
    "the new solutions have the same qualitative character for all types of the initial conditions ( oblate - oblate , oblate - prolate , and prolate - prolate ) , do not exhibit exponential damping , and closely follow the kinetic - theory solutions for systems far from and close to local thermal equilibrium .    the paper is written as follows : in sec .  [ sect : ke ] the kinetic equations for quarks , antiquarks , and gluons in the relaxation time approximation are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sect : zeromoment ] the zeroth moments of the quark and antiquark equations are discussed in the context of the baryon number conservation . in sec .",
    "[ sect : firstmoment ] we discuss the first moment of the kinetic equations and analyse the energy - momentum conservation .",

    "[ sect : secondmoment ] and our results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : res ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sect : con ] . throughout the paper",
    "we use natural units and the metric tensor s signature is @xmath2 .",
    "we start our analysis with the kinetic equations for quarks , antiquarks and gluons written in the relaxation time approximation ( rta )  @xcite .",
    "they read @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the quark ( antiquark ) phase - space distribution function , @xmath7 is the gluon distribution function , and @xmath8 is the relaxation time .",
    "the four - vector @xmath9 describes the hydrodynamic flow in the landau frame ( i.e. , @xmath9 is defined as the eigen four - vector of the energy - momentum tensor ) .    the quark and gluon distribution functions are assumed to have a generic structure  @xcite @xmath10 where the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 define the transverse momentum scale , @xmath13 is the non - equilibrium baryon chemical potential of quarks , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the anisotropy parameters . in local equilibrium ,",
    "the two anisotropy parameters vanish and eqs .",
    "( [ rsform ] ) are reduced to the standard equilibrium distributions @xmath16 where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath0 is the baryon chemical potential . for the sake of simplicity , we assume here the classical boltzmann statistics .",
    "a generalisation of the present results to the case of the quantum bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium distribution functions of the form ( [ eqforms ] ) are used to define the rta collision terms in  ( [ kineq0 ] ) and ( [ kineg0 ] ) . in this case @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be treated as the _ effective _ baryon chemical potential and effective temperature that are determined by the appropriate landau matching conditions .",
    "in addition to the flow vector @xmath9 , that can be parameterised in terms of the three - velocity in the standard way as @xmath17 we introduce the four - vector @xmath18 defined as  @xcite @xmath19 the appearance of @xmath18 is connected with the privileged direction of the beam axis .",

    "integrating eqs .  ( [ kineq0 ] ) and ( [ kineg0 ] ) over three - momentum and including the internal degrees of freedom we obtain the three scalar equations @xmath27 where we have introduced the non - equilibrium and equilibrium particle densities defined by the expressions @xmath28 note that for the ( 0 + 1)d system we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    instead of using eqs .",

    "( [ denq])([deng ] ) suggests that eq .",
    "( [ bnc0 ] ) should be supplemented by the two extra equations , for example , one equation for the sum of the quark and antiquark distributions and the other for the gluon distribution .",
    "it turns out , however , that the use of three equations obtained from the zeroth moment leads finally to an overdetermined system of equations .",
    "therefore , we have decided to use the linear combination defined by eq .",
    "( [ zm0 ] ) , where @xmath36 is a parameter taken from the range @xmath37 .",
    "one may check a posteriori which value of @xmath38 is the best by comparing the hydrodynamic results with the kinetic - theory results . in this way we have found that the best agreement is obtained for @xmath39 .",
    "a similar agreement is also obtained for the case @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the cases @xmath40 and @xmath39 do not introduce the coupling between the quark and gluon sectors at the level of the zeroth moment .",
    "this seems to be a desirable situation , since the kinetic equations ( [ kineq0])([kineg0 ] ) treated exactly include the coupling between the quark and gluon sectors _ only _ through the energy - momentum conservation ( that is within the first moment of eqs .",

    "<S> a system of equations for anisotropic hydrodynamics is derived that describes a mixture of anisotropic quark and gluon fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the consistent treatment of the zeroth , first and second moments of the kinetic equations allows us to construct a new framework with more general forms of the anisotropic phase - space distribution functions than those used before . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the main difficiencies of the previous formulations of anisotropic hydrodynamics for mixtures have been overcome and the good agreement with the exact kinetic - theory results is obtained . </S>"
