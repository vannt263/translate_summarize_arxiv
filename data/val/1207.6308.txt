    "seesaw mechanism is one of the popular mechanisms@xcite beyond the standard model ( sm ) which can provide some explanations why neutrino masses are so much smaller than their charged lepton partner mass scales @xmath0 . in type i and iii seesaw models@xcite it requires the existence of heavy right - handed neutrinos of a majorana mass scale @xmath1 .",
    "the light neutrino mass is of order @xmath2 .",
    "the usual scale of the heavy right - handed neutrino mass @xmath1 is expected to be super heavy which can be as high as the grand unification scale",
    ". it would be good if the seesaw mechanism can be tested by high energy colliders .",
    "the lhc can test theoretical models beyond the sm at an energy scale as high as 8 tev at present and will reach 14 tev in the future .",
    "if indeed the heavy seesaw scale is of grand unification scale , it is impossible to test seesaw mechanism directly at accessible collider energies .",
    "theoretically it is interesting to see if the seesaw scale can be lowered to tev range allowing direct probe of atlas and cms experiments at the lhc .",
    "there are indeed special solutions which allow lower heavy right handed neutrinos of order tev with the price of fine tuning of the parameters@xcite .",
    "although this is theoretically allowed , it loses the original motivation of naturally explanation for the lightness of neutrinos through seesaw mechanism .",
    "radiative seesaw neutrino mass generation can easy the problem and at the same time provide the much desired candidate for dark matter when additional symmetry exists to stablize the dark matter candidate@xcite .",
    "the inverse seesaw mechanism@xcite can also lower the seesaw scale . in the inverse seesaw model , the heavy majorana neutrinos",
    "are replaced by the heavy dirac particles .",
    "the light neutrino masses are of order @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the heavy dirac particle scale and @xmath4 is a majorana mass of the heavy dirac particles which are supposed to be small even compared with @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that the heavy dirac mass scale @xmath1 can be much lower than that for the majorna mass in the usual seesaw models naturally .",
    "if the inverse seesaw is also achieved by radiative correction , the heavy scale can be even lower@xcite .",
    "there are also other mechanisms to further lower the scale by naturally having a small @xmath4 parameter , such as that discussed in ref.@xcite through extra warped dimension . here",
    "we will study radiative inverse seesaw models . in achieving radiative mass generation ,",
    "sometimes it involves introduction of new symmetries to forbid terms which may induce tree level neutrino masses .",
    "if the symmetry introduced is unbroken , there may be a stable new particle in the theory .",
    "this new particle may play the role of the dark matter needed to explain about 23% of the energy budget of our universe@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study several simple models using a leptonic heavy dirac multiple to facilitate radiative inverse seesaw neutrino mass and also to have dark matter candidate .",
    "the inverse seesaw neutrino mass matrix @xmath5 is the mass matrix resulted from the effective lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the light active neutrino , @xmath8 are heavy neutrinos .    in the bases @xmath9 , @xmath5 is given by @xmath10    with the hierarchy @xmath11 , the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 , to order @xmath14 is given by@xcite @xmath15    there are different ways to achieve inverse seesaw mechanism depending on where @xmath8 comes from .",
    "we briefly outline two simple possibilities which may realize inverse seesaw at tree level .",
    "one of the simplest ways is to introduce right - handed @xmath16 and left - handed @xmath17 singlet heavy neutrinos with a discrete @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 symmetry and all other sm particles do not transform under this symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 term is generated through yukawa coupling @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is the sm higgs doublet which transform under the sm electroweak gauge group @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath26 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the sm lepton doublet .",
    "the @xmath29 terms are from bare majorana mass terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 . because the @xmath20 symmetry",
    ", the bare dirac mass term @xmath32 is not allowed . in order to generate a non - zero m term",
    ", one can introduce a singlet scale @xmath33 transforming under @xmath20 as @xmath34 with a non - zero vev @xmath35 . in this case , the yukawa term @xmath36 is allowed which generates a @xmath1 given by @xmath37",
    ".    one can also introduce a leptonic doublet @xmath38 along with a singlet @xmath33 and a triplet @xmath39 ( @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) to realize the inverse seesaw .",
    "one can introduce a global @xmath44 symmetry to distinguish @xmath45 and @xmath46 . under this symmetry @xmath47d_{l",
    ", r}$ ] , @xmath48s$ ] , @xmath49 \\delta$ ] , and other fields do not transform .",
    "we have the following lagrangian relevant to neutrino masses @xmath50    if both @xmath33 and @xmath51 develop non - zero vev s , the inverse seesaw mechanism is realized .",
    "this model , however , will have a goldstone boson due to breaking of the global @xmath44 symmetry which may be problematic . to avoid the existence of a goldstone boson in the theory ,",
    "extension is needed .",
    "also in the above two models , no candidates for dark matter .    in following sections , we will extend the two models discussed in this section to radiatively generate inverse seesaw neutrino masses .",
    "we will discuss the possibility of having dark matter candidates in these models .",
    "to avoid the appearance of massless goldstone boson in the theory , a possible approach is not to allow the global symmetry to break and therefore no goldstone boson emerges .",
    "applying this idea to the model involving @xmath52 , @xmath33 and @xmath51 are then not allowed to have vev s .",
    "this however also firbids the light neutrinos to have non - zero masses at tree level .",
    "we have to extend the model . to this end",
    ", we introduce another singlet @xmath53 which transforms under the @xmath44 as @xmath54\\sigma$ ] .",
    "we refer to this model as the @xmath44 model .",
    "the allowed renormalizable terms in the potential @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 where the sum @xmath57 is over all possible @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and @xmath58 to be one of the @xmath27 , @xmath33 , @xmath53 and @xmath51 .",
    "the allowed terms are : @xmath60 in the above the indices @xmath61 and @xmath62 indicate different ways of forming singlet .",
    "they are given by @xmath63    in the above @xmath64 are all larger than zero .",
    "the potential only allows @xmath27 to have a non - zero vev @xmath26 .",
    "the theory has an unbroken @xmath44 global symmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking from @xmath23 to @xmath65 . at the tree level ,",
    "light neutrinos are massless . giving the above terms in @xmath66 and @xmath55 ,",
    "it is not possible to defined conserved lepton number .",
    "this is because that among the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and @xmath70 vertices , there is always one vertex where lepton number is violated .",
    "for example , assigning @xmath46 to have lepton number @xmath71 and @xmath52 to have @xmath72 , if one demands conservation of lepton number as @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 vertices , at the vertex @xmath70 would violate lepton number by 2 units .",
    "one can demand other vertices to converse lepton number , but no matter what one chooses , the combination of terms proportional to @xmath73 always violate lepton number by 2 units .",
    "however , the global @xmath44 symmetry is respected .",
    "because of lepton number is violated , at loop levels , majorana neutrino masses may be generated .",
    "we find that non - zero majorana neutrino masses can be generated at two loop level shown in fig.1 .",
    "this two loop contribution violates the lepton number by 2 units .",
    "this two loop mass generation is similar to the babu - zee model two loop neutrino mass generation@xcite but with the light charged leptons in the loop replaced by new heavy particles .",
    "the last two terms in the potential are crucial for light neutrino mass generation .",
    "we will now describe how to calculate the two - loop induced light neutrino mass .",
    "after @xmath27 develops vev , mixing between @xmath74 and @xmath53 will be generated via the term @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding mass matrix for @xmath76 can be expressed as : @xmath77 with @xmath78    one can diagonalize the mass matrix via : @xmath79 with @xmath80    the light neutrino mass @xmath12 generated via two - loop diagram is given by : @xmath81    the last factor in the above can be written as @xmath82 . using , @xmath83 , and neglecting the mass splitting between @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the denominator , we obtain @xmath86 ^ 2}(\\frac{1}{p^2-m^2_{s}}\\frac{1}{q^2-m^2_{s}}-\\frac{1}{p^2-m^2_{s}}\\frac{1}{q^2-m^2}-\\frac{1}{p^2-m^2 }     \\frac{1}{q^2-m^2_{s}}\\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\frac{1}{p^2-m^2}\\frac{1}{q^2-m^2})\\;.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our results for the two loop integral agree with that obtained in ref.@xcite .    carrying out the loop integrals , we finally obtain @xmath87\\ ; ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88\\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 is the spence function or the dilogarithm function defined as : @xmath91 to compare with the inverse seesaw mass formula , we rewrite the above in a matrix form in the bases where @xmath1 is diagonalized @xmath92 where @xmath93 is defined as : @xmath94   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if one identifies , effectively , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 , the light neutrino mass matrix is effectively an inverse seesaw mass form . we therefore refer this as radiative inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "this model is different than those radiative inverse seesaw models discussed in ref.@xcite where additional neutral heavy spin - half particles are introduced to generate radiative neutrino masses .",
    "the above formula can easily fit current data on neutrino mixing and masses@xcite . as an example , let us consider a simple case with @xmath99 diagonal and @xmath100 . for the normal hierarchy , choose @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104gev , @xmath105gev , @xmath106gev , @xmath107gev",
    ", we can get all the three neutrino mass @xmath108ev , @xmath109ev , @xmath110ev , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with data . for inverted hierarchy case",
    ", we just need to replace @xmath99 with @xmath111 , with all the other parameters unchanged , the neutrino masses will be @xmath112ev , @xmath113ev , @xmath114ev , respectively . again , these numbers are consistent with data .    along the same idea , the case with singlet heavy neutrinos discussed earlier , can also be modified to have two loop realization of inverse seesaw mechanism . to this end",
    "we impose on the theory a global @xmath115 symmetry .",
    "the new particles beyond sm are : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . under the @xmath115",

    "is concerned the above two models are very similar . however ,",
    "when considering dark matter physics , these two models have different features .",
    "we proceed to discuss them in the following .",
    "since in both the @xmath44 and @xmath115 models , the global symmetries are not broken , there are stable particles which may play the role of dark matter .",
    "which one of the new particles is the lightest one depends on the parameter space and therefore determines which one plays the role of dark matter .    in the @xmath44 model ,",
    "the heavy fermion particles have non - zero hypercharge and can not play the role of dark matter .",
    "this is because that although dark matter relic density can be produced by dark matter annihilate into gauge particle with known interaction strength with sufficiently large dark matter mass , the direct detection rate from t - channel z boson exchange would be too large .",
    "this possibility is therefore ruled out .",
    "the neutral components of the scalar fields in the models are other possibilities which may be identified as dark matter .",
    "the neutral component @xmath74 , has problem to play the role of dark matter due to its non - zero hypercharge .",
    "if the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath74 masses @xmath132 and @xmath133 have a splitting @xmath134 , the non - zero hypercharge problem can be resolved by invoking the inelastic dark matter mechanism@xcite , namely the scattering of a dark matter off nucleon is kinematically forbidden if the mass splitting @xmath135 is larger than 100 kev or so . in the @xmath44 model , however , we find that it is not possible to generate a non - zero @xmath135 for the real and imaginary parts in @xmath74 , the inelastic dark matter mechanism is ineffective .",
    "the natural dark matter field is @xmath33 .",
    "it does not have a non - zero hypercharge and does not mix with any particle having hypercharge . as long as dark matter properties",
    "are concerned , this model is very similar to the real singlet ( darkon ) model@xcite and therefore similar dark matter properties@xcite and identical to the complex scalar singlet model@xcite with degenerate mass for the real and imaginary parts of s. this is a typical higgs portal model .",
    "dark matter annihilation and detection are all mediated by higgs boson .",
    "the term important is @xmath136 .",
    "removing the would - be goldstone bosons in @xmath27 , we have @xmath137    the first term will modify the mass of @xmath33 from @xmath138 to @xmath139 . as long as dark matter annihilation and detection",
    "are concerned , the free parameters are : @xmath140 , @xmath141 and also the higgs boson mass . in the model ,",
    "the higgs boson @xmath142 properties , its mass and its couplings to sm particles ( fermions and gauge bosons ) , are very close to the sm higgs boson @xmath143 .",
    "the recent lhc data indicate that the mass is about 125 gev@xcite .",
    "we will analyze the model using higgs mass of @xmath144 gev .",
    "the dark matter relic density and direct detection constraints on the coupling @xmath141 and @xmath140 are shown in fig .",
    "since now we have two degenerate components as dark matter , the constraint on @xmath141 from relic density is @xmath145 times smaller than the darkon model@xcite .",
    "the recent data on direct dark matter search from xenon100@xcite put the most strigent constraint on the allowed range for dark matter mass .",
    "the range of a few tens of gev for dark matter mass is in trouble .",
    "however , dark matter mass about half of the higgs mass and larger than 130 gev is still allowed .     as the dark matter with higgs mass set to be 125 gev .",
    "the projected xenon1 t sensitivity is also drawn.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +   as the dark matter with higgs mass set to be 125 gev .",
    "the projected xenon1 t sensitivity is also drawn.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the @xmath53 field is also a possibility for dark matter since it does not have a hypercharge neither .",
    "it mixes with @xmath74 after @xmath27 develops @xmath146 through the term : @xmath147 .",
    "the lighter of physical particle which may play the role of dark matter will also has a non - zero @xmath148 coupling .",
    "however , in this case there is the mixing parameter to tune to satisfy the constraint .",
    "we find that as long as the parameter @xmath149 is less than @xmath150 , the large direct detection cross section can be solved .",
    "we also checked that @xmath151 of order @xmath150 can be made compatible with the neutrino mass generation requirement . with @xmath152 , the dark matter",
    "is dominated by the component @xmath53 .",
    "the dark matter properties are similar to @xmath33 .",
    "we now briefly discuss dark matter properties in the @xmath115 model . in this model , the neutral scalars in @xmath153 , @xmath51 and @xmath33 , and the @xmath154 are possible candidates for dark matter .",
    "the neutral components in @xmath153 and @xmath51 have hypercharges and also there are no mass splitting between the real and imaginary parts , they have too large cross section for direct dark matter detection after fitting relic density requirement . the @xmath33 field",
    "although does not have a hypercharge , it mixes with @xmath74 , some fine tuning is needed to be compatible with direct dark matter detection data .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of @xmath53 as the dark matter in the @xmath44 model .",
    "this is similar to the case of @xmath53 as dark matter as in the @xmath44 model .",
    "the @xmath154 field does not have hypercharge and may also play the role of dark matter . in this case , the dark matter relic density is achieved by t - channel exchange of @xmath153 induced @xmath155 pair annihilate into lepton pairs , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the annihilation rate is governed by the yukawa coupling @xmath158 , the mass @xmath159 of @xmath153 and also the dark matter mass @xmath160 .",
    "we have checked that there are parameter space where the correct relic density can be produced . in fig.3",
    "we show some correlations of the parameters which can produce the correct relic density . at the tree level ,",
    "@xmath154 does not couple to quarks .",
    "however , at one loop level , with @xmath46 and @xmath153 in the loop @xmath161-@xmath154-@xmath148 coupling can be generated which can lead to sizeable dark matter direct detection cross section and at the same time satisfy the dark matter relic density constraint .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we again see that the recent xenon100@xcite data put stringent constraint on the allowed range for dark matter mass .",
    "but the @xmath154 can still play the role of dark matter with appropriate masses . +     as the dark matter .",
    "the different curves are for @xmath153 mass to be 200 gev , 300 gev and 500 gev , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    as the dark matter .",
    "the different curves are for @xmath153 mass to be 200 gev , 300 gev and 500 gev , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "we have proposed two models , the @xmath44 and @xmath115 models , in which neutrino masses are generated through inverse seesaw mechanism at two loop level . in these models ,",
    "a global @xmath162 is unbroken leading to a stable beyond sm new particle in each model .",
    "these stable new particles are natural candidates for dark matter .",
    "we find that these models can satisfy current experimental constraints from neutrino masses , mixing , dark matter relic density and direct detections .",
    "because in these models the neutrino masses are generated at two loop level and also inverse seesaw type , the seesaw scale can be as low as a few hundred gev .",
    "this can lead to observable signatures . before closing",
    ", we would like to make a few comments about some phenomenological implications of the models .",
    "one of them is related to higgs properties .",
    "although the higgs couplings to sm particles are not modified at tree level , there are noticeable corrections at one loop level in the above two models .",
    "an important example is the modification to @xmath163 . because the existence of the two terms @xmath164 in both models and ( @xmath165 terms in the @xmath115 model , terms like @xmath166 and @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) will be generated after @xmath27 develops vev , the @xmath169 can be modified . at present the experimental value@xcite for this channel is @xmath170 ( atlas ) ( @xmath171(cms ) ) times that predicted by the sm .",
    "the central value is higher than the sm prediction . with large enough @xmath172",
    ", one may bring the value to close to the data .",
    "another is related to probing the new degrees of freedom in the models at the lhc . in both models there",
    "are new charged particles , the @xmath51 , @xmath153 and @xmath173 fields",
    ". the particles in this multiplet can be pair produced via electromagnetic and weak interactions .",
    "however , in both models there are unbroken @xmath162 symmetries , the new particles can not decay into pure sm final state making detection difficult .",
    "a possible signature is that the charged new particle decays into an sm particle and a dark matter .",
    "the sm particle is detected , but the dark matter carries away large transverse missing momentum and energy .",
    "for example for the @xmath44 model , with @xmath33 been the dark matter , @xmath174 can decay into a charged lepton @xmath175 and the dark matter @xmath33 . in the @xmath115 model with @xmath154 being the dark matter",
    ", @xmath176 can decay into a charged lepton and the dark matter .",
    "finally , there are potentially large fcnc effects in leptonic sector in these models .",
    "this is because that the yukawa couplings @xmath158 in both models can be of order @xmath177 , at loop level exchange @xmath173 and @xmath33 , and , @xmath154 and @xmath33 in the @xmath44 and @xmath115 models , respectively , can generate flavor changing radiative decay of charged lepton @xmath178 with branching ratios close to the current experimental bound@xcite .",
    "also possible large @xmath179 conversion . near future improved experiments can test these models@xcite .",
    "detailed analysis will be presented else where .",

    "<S> if terms inducing seesaw masses are further induced by loop corrections , the seesaw scale can be lowered to be in the range probed by experiments at the lhc without fine tuning . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> although the recent data from xenon100 put stringent constraint on the models , they can be consistent with data on neutrino masses , mixing , dark matter relic density and direct detection . </S>",
    "<S> these models also have some interesting experimental signatures for collider and flavor physics . </S>"
