    "the oscillations of rotating neutron stars are of great interest in astrophysics .",

    "different modes of oscillation depend on different pieces of internal physics and one may hope to use observations to probe , for example , the composition of the high - density region  @xcite .",
    "work in this area , which has a long history ( for a review see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gained further momentum recently with the relatively successful matching between observed quasiperiodic oscillations in the tails of magnetar flares and calculated torsional oscillations of the neutron star crust  @xcite .",
    "the excitement following these , the first ever , observations of likely neutron star vibrations is significant .",
    "it is clear that our models need to be improved significantly if we expect to carry out a quantitative astero - seismology programme for neutron stars , but the prospects for improvements look good .",
    "after all , we already have a reasonable understanding of the dynamics of the crust region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the superfluid components in the core of the star  @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by the need to consider more realistic models of rapidly rotating stars",
    ". our emphasis will be on the role of the internal stratification associated with composition variations .",
    "this leads to the presence of the so - called g - modes  @xcite , and we want to investigate how these modes are affected by fast rotation ( the analogous problem for thermal ocean g - modes of rapidly rotating neutron stars has already been considered , see @xcite ) . in order to determine the rotational effects on the oscillation spectrum we study linear perturbations of axisymmetric stellar configurations , where the coriolis force and the centrifugal flattening of the star are included in the background . in this way",
    ", we go beyond the so - called slow rotation approximation , where the rotation itself is treated perturbatively and the mode - frequencies of non - rotating models are determined by a perturbation expansion with respect to the angular velocity of the star @xmath0 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the relationship between the g - modes of a stratified stellar model and the inertial modes  @xcite , for which the coriolis force is the main restoring agent .",
    "the inertial modes are important since they may be driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the strongest instability is associated with the so - called r - modes  @xcite .",
    "a key issue concerns the amplitude at which an unstable mode saturates .",
    "detailed work has shown that an unstable r - mode saturates due to nonlinear couplings to other inertial modes  @xcite .",
    "however , the mode saturation has only been considered for slowly rotating , non - stratified models and it is important to ask to what extent these results will change if the models are made more realistic . in stratified neutron stars ,",
    "the g - modes tend to become rotationally dominated beyond a certain rotation rate   and may then be called inertia - gravity modes  @xcite .",
    "effects due to the stratification are thus weakened , which indicates that the r - mode saturation estimates may still be reliable , at least for the fastest spinning systems .    improving and extending a numerical code that has been used to study non - stratified stars  @xcite",
    ", we approach the problem via time - evolutions of the equations that govern the linear perturbations of a , potentially rapidly , rotating newtonian star .",
    "this strategy has the advantage that one does not have to deal with the many rotationally coupled multipoles , that tend to make a slow - rotation calculation less tractable . on the other hand , a numerical evolution is not expected to have the precision of a frequency domain calculation .",
    "neither should one expect it to yield the complete spectrum of modes .",
    "after all , the simulation results depend on the chosen initial data . in absence of a clear idea of the nature of the various modes",
    "one does not know how to excite specific oscillations .",
    "one way around this problem is to follow the `` recycling '' strategy developed by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another , more pragmatic , approach is to simply study the modes that are excited by `` generic '' initial data .",
    "this is the attitude that we adopt here .",
    "we want to investigate the effect that composition variations have on the various oscillation modes of a rapidly rotating neutron star . to do this",
    ", we consider an equilibrium configuration representing a rapidly and uniformly rotating star containing three particle species .",
    "we assume that matter is composed of degenerate neutrons @xmath1 , protons @xmath2 and electrons @xmath3 . for simplicity",
    ", we further assume that neutrons and protons are not superfluid .",
    "in essence , our model represents the conditions in the outer core of a very young neutron star that has not yet cooled below the temperature at which the baryons form superfluid condensates ( in practice with a core temperature significantly above @xmath4  k ) .",
    "we also do not consider the various exotic phases of matter that may be present in the deep core of a realistic neutron star model , e.g. hyperons or deconfined quarks  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accounting for the presence of such phases would not be too difficult , but at this stage our focus is on understanding the basic role of composition variations . we are already extending this work to account for the presence of superfluid components and expect to report on results in this direction soon .",
    "the matter composition is represented by the three number densities @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is either @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "charge neutrality is provided by the coulomb interaction , that efficiently lock together protons and electrons  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus we have @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the velocity of each fluid component . in this model ,",
    "the pressure @xmath13 is a function of two variables , e.g. the neutron and proton number densities or alternatively the total baryon number density @xmath14 and the proton fraction @xmath15 . in the unperturbed stellar model",
    ", it is assumed that the weak interaction processes : @xmath16 lead to @xmath17-equilibrium .",
    "the proton fraction is then only a function of the baryon number density ( or equivalently the baryon mass density @xmath18 , where for simplicity the proton and neutron masses have been assumed equal ) .",

    "they studied inertia - gravity modes of @xmath127 polytropic models with weak stratification and slow rotation .",
    "in fact , their frozen adiabatic index corresponds to @xmath128 and the fastest rotating model they consider represents @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath49 are respectively the mass and radius of the non - rotating models . in our units",
    "this rotation rate in equivalent to @xmath131 and an axis ratio @xmath132 .",
    "in contrast , in the present work we investigate rapidly rotating models up to @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) and with larger composition gradients .",
    "we have tested our results against those of  @xcite by numerically evolving @xmath33 perturbations of the two slowest rotating models reported in table  [ tab : back - models ] with @xmath135 .",
    "the frequencies have an accuracy to better than 2 percent .",
    "finally , equations  ( [ eq : connrule1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : connrule2 ] ) respect the connection rules reported in  @xcite .",
    "g - modes ( solid lines ) for @xmath30 models and axial - led inertial modes ( dashed line ) of the barotropic models @xmath136 .",
    "frequencies are measured in the rotating frame .",
    "the counter- and co - rotating @xmath137 modes approach the frequencies of the axial - led inertial modes in the limit of fast rotation .",
    "in contrast , the r - mode is essentially unaffected by composition gradients .",

    "information concerning the oscillation spectra of realistic neutron star models helps develop our understanding of the physics required to describe these objects .",
    "any spectral property can in principle be attributed to particular physical quantities or configurations of the star .",
    "astero - seismology studies , using either electromagnetic or gravitational signals ( or indeed both ) may thus help constrain the state of matter at supernuclear densities . of course",
    ", in order to facilitate this , we need to improve our theoretical models and clarify the origin of various stellar pulsation features .    in this paper , we have studied the pulsations of stratified and rapidly rotating neutron stars with the aim of understanding the dependence of the composition g - modes on the rotation rate of the star .",
    "the stellar pulsations were studied using the linearised euler and conservation equations on an axisymmetric background . in order to simplify the problem",
    ", we used the cowling approximation where the gravitational potential perturbations are neglected .",
    "this approximation generates only a small error in the g - mode frequencies .",
    "the system of perturbation equations was evolved in time by a 2d numerical code based on a standard finite differencing scheme .",
    "this code was tested against various results available in literature and demonstrated good accuracy .    since both coriolis and buoyancy forces act on a perturbed fluid element of a rotating and stratified star , the low - frequency modes have a mixed inertia - gravity character .",
    "they typically behave as g - modes in the slowly rotating limit , while they assume the properties of the inertial modes when the star rotates rapidly . by comparing the oscillation frequencies and the associated eigenfunctions of barotropic inertial modes and the inertia - gravity modes of non - barotropic stars ,",
    "we have demonstrated how the two sets of modes are associated at fast rotation rates .",
    "our results show that it would be difficult to deduce the presence of composition gradients from the inertia - gravity mode spectrum of fast rotating stars . however , as the neutron star ages and spins down , the dependence of the inertia - gravity modes on the star s rotation and their deviation from the inertial barotropic modes can , at least in principle , be used to estimate the brunt - visl frequency and the degree of stratification .    as an extension of this work",
    ", we are currently developing a numerical code for studying the dynamics of rapidly rotating superfluid neutron stars .",
    "this is an important development since all mature neutron stars are expected to have superfluid components in the core .",
    "it is also well known that the associated multi - fluid dynamics leaves an imprint on the stellar oscillation spectrum , see @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "we hope to be able to report on the initial results of this investigation soon .",
