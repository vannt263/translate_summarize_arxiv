    "quasar absorption line systems provide a unique tool to study the evolution of galaxies through their lifetime .",
    "since the galaxies associated with such systems are selected by their gas cross section , as compared to their stellar luminosities from multi broad band imaging techniques , absorption lines provide us with a complementary view on galaxy properties and evolution .",
    "one of the best studied population of galaxies is the one selected by the mgii absorption doublet @xmath7  .",
    "magnesium is produced by alpha - processes in post main sequence stars and , therefore , is abundant in galaxies .",
    "in addition , mgii doublet is easy to observe because it has a large cross section for absorption , it can be easily identified and the rest frame wavelengths @xmath8     are detectable from the ground over the full redshift range @xmath9 .",
    "depending on whether the equivalent width , @xmath4 of the mgii 2796    line is greater or smaller than @xmath10 , the absorption systems is classified as strong or weak , respectively .",
    "the fact that the equivalent width distribution appears to steepen below @xmath10 , lends support to the idea that weak and strong absorbers constitute two distinct populations .",

    "it is well established that if there is strong mgii absorption line , then in almost all cases a galaxy is found within 100 kpc with a median impact parameter of around 50 kpc ( steidel et al .",

    "however , the nature of the objects selected by weak mgii absorption is not yet completely clear .",
    "it has been suggested that they form a separate populations of galaxies with respect to those traced by strong absorbers , e.g. low surface brightness galaxies or dwarf galaxies ( churchill et al .",
    "1999 , narayanan et al .",
    "alternatively , the weak systems could be tracing the same galaxies as the strong absorbers , but at a higher qso impact parameter where the gas density is much lower and , hence , the equivalent width smaller ( churchill et al . 2005 , kacprzak et al . 2008 ) .",

    "this implies the presence of @xmath19 g strong , large scale magnetic fields in the associated galaxies .    in this work",
    "we extend our analysis to weak mgii absorption systems with equivalent width in the range @xmath20 .",
    "we show that unlike their strong counterpart , weak absorbers do not contribute with any significance to the observed rms .",
    "we discuss the possible interpretations of this result .",
    "we also show that this result argues against the case in which the correlation between rm and strong mgii absorption systems reported in bernet et al . ( 2008 ) arises due to an intrinsic evolution of qsos magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ data : sec ] we present the mgii absorption system catalogue , including the details of the observations and data analysis ; in sec .  [ mgii : sec ] we analyze the statistical properties of the detected absorption systems and compare with previous work ; sec .",

    "[ sum : sec ] concludes the paper .",
    "our dataset consists of 77 qso spectra obtained with the high resolution uves spectrograph at the vlt .",
    "the qsos were selected from the larger sample of 901 radio sources with determined rm and redshifts presented in kronberg et .",
    "al ( 2008 ) .",
    "the selection was based on the following criteria : i ) redshift range @xmath21 , ii ) galactic latitudes @xmath22 and iii ) @xmath23 .",
    "the latter was imposed to have adequate s / n in exposures times up to 30 minutes per object . in order to produce a complete census of strong mgii absorption systems in the redshift range @xmath24 , we required a signal to noise ratio per resolution element s / n@xmath25 , across the full spectral range , although the data quality was typically better than that . to fully cover the redshift path to each qso we chose the following standard setting of uves , with dichroic 1 having central wavelengths 390 nm and 580 nm , and dichroic 2 having central wavelengths 437 nm and 760 nm for the blue and red arm , respectively .",
    "this results in complete wavelength coverage from 3480@xmath5 to 9460 @xmath5 with only two small spectral gaps between 5762 - 5834 @xmath5 and 7513 - 7660 @xmath5 due to the small gap between the two ccds of the red arm of uves .",
    "we chose a slit width of @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the blue arm and red arm respectively .",
    "the observations took place during 3 nights on 28 - 30 july 2006 ( in visitor mode ) and during 30 hrs of service mode observations carried out between october 2006 to april 2007 .",
    "the spectra were bias subtracted , flat - fielded and wavelength calibrated using the eso midas package in the optimal mode .",
    "the reduced 1 dimensional vacuum - heliocentric corrected exposures were first scaled to the same flux level and then co - added , weighted by the s / n of the corresponding pixel .",
    "the spectra were then normalized using a spline method to fit the continuum .",
    "to increase the s / n of the spectra the overlapping wavelength regions of different settings were also co - added .    to detect the absorption lines we used the so called `` aperture '' method ( lanzetta et al .",
    "namely , we identified strong mgii absorption systems by requiring a 5@xmath29 detection of the rest frame equivalent width of the mgii @xmath30 2796    line .",
    "the absorption system was considered a mgii absorption identification if there was also at least a 2.5@xmath29 detection of the corresponding @xmath30 2803    line at the same redshift .",
    "we further checked if the doublet ratio , @xmath31 , of the mgii lines lay within the range from 1.0 for completely unsaturated lines and 2.0 for saturated lines ( within errors ) .",
    "we also visually checked the line system for similar profile shapes to exclude chance alignments .",
    "mgii systems within 500 km @xmath32 of each other are considered as one single absorption system with the equivalent widths added together .",
    "we also visually inspected the flux spectra to look for mgii absorption lines that might have been missed by the alogrithm .",
    "this was twice the case , where the stronger @xmath33    line was detected as a single absorption line but the weaker @xmath34    line consisted of 2 separate lines , with miscalculated centroids .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : comp_ewdist ]    for the equivalent width range @xmath35 we can additionaly compare the @xmath36 with the results of crcv99 and nmct07 which both give the @xmath36 in the redshift range 0.4 - 1.4 . below @xmath10",
    "the equivalent width distribution distinctly rises above the single exponential fit for @xmath37 as previously seen by nestor et .",
    "al 2006 and nmct07 .",
    "this is further shown in the inset in figure @xmath38 where the red dashed line corresponds to the best fit to systems with @xmath39 by ntr05 .",
    "note that there is a slight discrepancy between nmct07 and crcv99 , in that crcv99 finds systematically more mgii systems in all 3 plotted equivalent width bins ( [ 0.0165,0.1 ] , [ 0.1,0.2 ] , [ 0.2,0.3 ] @xmath5 ) .",
    "for the lowest equivalent width bin , centered at @xmath40 , this is a the level of @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to make a statement about the discrepancy because our redshift path falls dramatically in this equivalent width bin .",
    "bernet et al . ( 2008 ) showed that the rotation measure distribution function , for lines of sight with strong mgii absorption lines , is significantly broader than those without such lines .",
    "this led those authors to conclude that there must exist substantial magnetized plasma in or near the absorption line systems .",
    "it is unclear at this stage whether the association is direct , or whether the mgii absorption merely indicates that the quasar sightline passes throug a galactic halo .",
    "regardless , this result suggests the presence of @xmath19gauss - level large - scale magnetic fields in or around typical galaxies when the universe was a half or less of its current age , with important implications for our understanding of the development of magnetic fields in galaxies , and in particular setting interesting constraints on the required efficiency of the conventional galactic dynamo model .    since our catalogue of mgii absorption systems is complete down to @xmath16 , we can now repeat the analyis of bernet et al .",

    "this would clarify whether or not weak mgii systems also have large scale magnetic fields that contribute to the observed rotation measure .",
    "figure , @xmath42 , compares the rm cumulative distribution functions having @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 refers to the number of strong and weak mgii absorption lines for the left and right panel , respectively .",
    "the left panel is the result already presented in bernet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . for this panel",
    ", a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the rm distributions for @xmath46 are different at the 94.5@xmath47 significance level and those for @xmath48 at the 99.98@xmath47 significance level .",
    "given that we were testing a specific hypothesis in an clean way with completely independent observational data , we regard this result as significant . on the other hand ,",
    "the right panel was built using the weak mgii absorbers catalogue of this paper ( including here also the 8 systems below @xmath49 ) and the same rm data as in bernet et al .",
    "note that in this case @xmath50 , which does not account for the number of strong mgii absorption lines along the lines of sight .",
    "a ks - test does not recognize any difference in the rm distribution functions for @xmath43 with a significance level of 22.1@xmath47 and 31.0@xmath47 for @xmath51 .",
    "since the rm distributions look statistically equivalent independent of the number of weak mgii absorption systems , it is immediately clear that the weak mgii absorption system contribution to the observed qso rm must be negligible .",
    "this result was also hinted at in observed redshift dependence of the rm distribution ( see kronberg et al .",
    "2008 ) . in that work ,",
    "our analysis was based solely on the rm distribution of 268 quasars in the range @xmath52 , without any spectroscopic information .",
    "it was noted that the observed increase in the width of the rm distribution with redshift was better reproduced by a simple model in which the statistics of the intervenors was given by the relatively rare strong mgii systems than by one which included also the commoner weaker absorption systems .",
    "due to the increased number of intervenors at low redshifts in this model , the increase in the width of the rm distribution already starts at @xmath53 which is not seen in the actual data , where the increase happens around @xmath54 .      as pointed out in bernet et .",
    "al ( 2008 ) , because the probability of intercepting a mgii absorber along the l.o.s increases strongly with the qso redshift , a strong evolution of the magnetic fields , local to the qsos could give rise to a fitticious correlation of @xmath55 with the number of strong mgii absorption lines . the evolution in the magnetic fields local to the qsos",
    "would have to be significant , in order to produce the observed increase in rm dispersion with z despite the strong @xmath56 `` k - correction '' in the observed rm , due to the @xmath57 dependence of the rm .    by comparing the median of the @xmath55 distribution of l.o.s with and without strong mgii absorption for different qso redshifts , bernet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that there is only a 7@xmath47 chance probability that their result was due the above spurious correlation or , in general , to a correlation between redshift and @xmath55 .    our new demonstration above that sightlines with weak mgii absorption",
    "do not show statistically enhanced @xmath55 values , can be used as an even more convincing test to rule out the possibility that an underlying correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath58 causes the observed rm broadening at high redshifts .        in the left - hand panel of figure @xmath59 the redshift distributions for the qsos whose sightlines do and do not exhibit strong mgii absorption systems are shown as red and black shaded histograms .",
    "the same is shown on the right - hand panel for the weak mgii absorption systems .",
    "apparently the qso redshift distributions are very similar independent of whether the mgii absorption systems belongs to the weak or strong category .",
    "a ks - test reveals no difference between them with a significance level of @xmath60 for sightlines with weak and strong mgii absorption systems and @xmath61 for sightlines without weak or strong mgii absorption systems .",
    "the cumulative @xmath55 distributions for different number of mgii systems in figure @xmath42 look , however , very different , depending on whether they are selected according to the presence of strong or weak mgii systems . there is a clear broadening of the @xmath55 distribution with increasing number of strong mgii absorption lines @xmath62 .",
    "however , there is virtually no difference in the @xmath55 distributions for different numbers of weak absorbers @xmath63 .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the correlation between @xmath64 and the number of strong mgii absorption lines observed in bernet et .",
    "al ( 2008 ) is due to an underlying correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath58 .",
    "figure @xmath65 shows further evidence that the broadening in the rm distribution with redshift is caused by the magnetic fields traced by strong mgii systems .",
    "the left - hand panel compares the cumulative rm distribution function for qso from our entire sample with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it clearly shows that the high redshift distribution function is broader with respect to the low redshift counterpart .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the chances of intercepting a mgii absorption systems are higher at higher redshifts .",
    "in fact , as we take out the lines of sight containing strong mgii absorbers , the two distributions do not show significant differences anymore ( right panel ) .",
    "for the lines of sight without strong mgii absorbers , the median @xmath55 for both low ( @xmath68 ) and high redshifts ( @xmath69 ) is around 20 rad @xmath70 .",
    "this suggests that the l.o.s without strong mgii absorption systems ( 39 qsos ) are dominated by contributions from magnetic fields within the milky way , which is about 20 rad m@xmath71 ( bernet et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "any extragalactic rm contributions which increase with z , e.g. intergalactic magnetic fields , envolving rm contributions local to the qso , are probably swamped by the galactic one .",
    "it is interesting to note that all 4 @xmath55 values with @xmath72 rad @xmath73 are at @xmath67 .",
    "this might be partially explained by the fact that a rm contribution local to a qso at redshift @xmath58 is reduced by a factor @xmath74 when transformed to the observers frame .",
    "thus ( non - evolving ) rm contributions local to the qso might just fall below the galactic contribution at significantly higher redshifts than 1 .      in order to address the question of why weak absorbers do not contribute to the rm of distant qsos",
    ", it is important to understand the nature of the weak mgii absorber systems .",
    "it has been proposed that these systems are associated with low surface brightness galaxies ( churchill @xmath11 le brun 1997 ) , intergalactic star forming pockets ( rigby et al . 2002 ) or dwarf galaxies ( zonak et al . 2004 ) .",
    "more recent works ( churchill et al . 2005 , kacprzak et al . 2007 ) , however , indicate that for some fraction of the weak mgii systems a normal @xmath75 associated galaxy can be found .",
    "the impact parameters of the 7 weak mgii system where churchill et al .",
    "2005 have hst imaging range from 35 to 115 kpc .",
    "it still needs to be sorted out how this is consistent with the general picture that weak mgii systems are sub lyman limit systems .",
    "the lack of quantitative knowledge about the fraction of weak mgii systems that can be associated with normal galaxies like the ones traced by the strong systems makes it hard to draw strong conclusions from our observation .",
    "we need to have a better knowledge about the differences in the impact parameter distribution of the galaxies traced by the strong and weak systems and their properties , e.g. luminosity , color .",
    "the work of chen @xmath11 tinker 2008 shows that the impact parameters of the galaxies traced by the weak absorbers are generally larger than those traced by the strong systems ; they find a moderate anticorrelation between the equivalent width of the identified mgii systems and the impact parameters of the galaxies at the 97@xmath47 level .",
    "an inspection of the impact parameters in chen @xmath11 tinker 2008 shows that the median impact parameters of the weak absorbers is around @xmath76 whereas @xmath77 for the strong absorbers .",
    "it is thus plausible that the weak systems are preferentially produced by l.o.s through the outer regions of a galaxy .",
    "since rm @xmath78 , with @xmath79 the density of free electrons and b the magnetic field along l.o.s , we also expect any rm contribution to decline quite rapidly with impact parameter . for strong absorption systems , it has been suggested that on average larger equivalent widths ( i.e. stronger absorbers ) correspond to galaxies with bluer spectra and smaller impact parameters ( zibetti et al 2007 ) .",
    "if this trend was found to also extend to the weak absorbers , one could also attribute the presence of weaker magnetic fields in weak absorbers to the lower star formation activity there .",
    "we have presented a catalogue of strong and weak mgii absorption systems with equivalent width down to 0.1 @xmath5 , obtained from a survey of 77 qsos using the uves spectrograph at the vlt .",
    "we determine the statistical properties of strong mgii systems and find them in good agreement with previous results .",
    "in particular , we confirm the upturn in @xmath80 at lower redshifts ( z @xmath81 0.6 ) for systems in the equivalent width range @xmath82 . compared with no - evolution models in a @xmath83cdm universe",
    "we find more mgii systems at lower redshifts .",
    "concerning the weak absorption systems , we point out that the previously observed increase with redshift of @xmath84 ( crcv99 , nmct07 ) , pertains only to the very weak absorbers with @xmath85 . instead , @xmath2 for absorbers with @xmath4 in the range 0.10.3",
    "@xmath5 actually decreases , similarly to the case of strong absorbers .",
    "we use this catalogue to extend our previous analysis of the connection between the presence of intervening absorption and the faraday rotation measure of the quasar .",
    "we show that unlike strong mgii systems , weak mgii absorbers do not contribute to the observed rotation measure .",
    "this is likely due to the higher impact parameters of , and/or to lower star formation activity systems traced by , the weak absorbers with respect to strong ones .",
    "we use the lack of correlation of rm with number of weak mgii absorbers to rule out the possibility that the correlation of rm with number of strong mgii absorbers observed in bernet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is due an underlying correlation of rotation measure with redshift , caused , for example , by strong evolution of magnetic field local to the qsos environments .",
    "we also show that , while the distribution of rm for qsos above @xmath86 is distinctly broader than the corresponding distribution for qsos with @xmath87 , the difference disappears once the lines of sight exhibiting mgii absorption are removed .",
    "this further shows that : ( a ) the increase in the width of the rm distribution with redshift is indeed caused by large scale magnetic fields traced by strong mgii systems and ( b ) that any further extragalactic rm contribution is most likely swamped by local milky way foreground contributions .",
