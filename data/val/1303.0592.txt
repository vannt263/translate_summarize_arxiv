    "in multi - antenna downlink systems , transmission strategies which require less feedback resources @xcite to fully utilize multiuser diversity @xcite , but with asymptotic sum capacity comparable to dirty paper coding @xcite , are favored .",
    "the idea of random beamforming @xcite , which satisfies the two aforementioned features has drawn much interest in recent years @xcite . in the basic random beamforming strategy suggested in @xcite , the transmitter with @xmath0 transmit antennas generates @xmath0 random orthonormal beams and requires each user to feed back the @xmath1 experienced by them for each beam . then the transmitter schedules users for transmission that currently have the best channel for each random beam . despite the considerable literature on this topic ,",
    "there are three existing open problems :    1 .   how to address heterogeneous users with diverse large scale channel effects and the impact on scheduling policy ? 2",
    "what is the closed form sum rate by exact performance analysis ?",
    "3 .   what is the effect of selective feedback , both spatial and spectral , on the randomness of multiuser diversity ?    the first problem is related to a practical downlink system setting with asymmetrically located users having heterogeneous large scale channel effects .",
    "this near - far effect was first treated in @xcite by observing that the system becomes interference dominated when @xmath0 is large enough . in the large @xmath0 setting , the authors prove that users are asymptotically equiprobable to be scheduled",
    ". however , when @xmath0 is finite and not increasing simultaneously with the number of users , the greedy scheduling policy employed in @xcite can not maintain fairness among users .",
    "also , if a round robin scheduling policy was utilized , fairness can be guaranteed , but no multiuser diversity gain could be achieved for capacity growth . therefore , an alternate scheduling policy is needed to maintain fairness while exploiting multiuser diversity at the same time . in this paper , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf)-based scheduling policy @xcite is leveraged and analyzed in the random beamforming framework , wherein the user whose rate for a given beam is high enough but least probable to become higher is selected . under this scheduling policy , each user can be equivalently viewed as competing with other users with the same cdf , thus making the study of individual user rate more relevant and interesting than that of the sum rate . in this paper , we develop the notion of individual sum rate , which is the individual user rate multiplied by the number of users , in order to demonstrate the multiuser diversity gain with user growth for a given user .",
    "the second problem addresses exact system analysis , namely deriving closed form expression for the sum rate for arbitrary but finite number of users .",
    "note that even with full feedback , wherein each user conveys back the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( @xmath1 ) for @xmath0 beams , the closed form sum rate has not been derived .",
    "this is partially due to the complicated form of @xmath1 and its interplay with multiuser diversity . in this work ,",
    "the problem is tackled and solved by a novel probability density function ( pdf ) decomposition @xcite which decomposes and interprets the selected user s @xmath1 . in @xcite ,",
    "the homogeneous setting is considered and in this paper , the technique is extended to the heterogeneous user setting and the closed form individual sum rate is derived .",
    "the closed form result under full feedback helps in evaluating the system performance and acts as the building block for exact analysis with selective feedback .",
    "the third problem is concerned with standard selective feedback in the spatial dimension , wherein each user feeds back the @xmath1 for the best beam among the @xmath0 beams and the corresponding beam index .",
    "this selective feedback is fundamentally different than full feedback in two aspects .",
    "the first difference is the two - stage maximization with the first stage maximization carried out by each user for feedback selection and the second stage maximization carried out by the scheduler to perform user selection .",
    "since the best beam is selected by each user , the first stage maximization is over @xmath0 correlated @xmath1 .",
    "this correlation issue has been addressed in @xcite , and the cdf for the selected @xmath1 at the user side is derived . in this paper , we propose an approximation for the cdf and utilize it to derive closed form rate approximation .",
    "the other fundamental difference is the number of the @xmath1 values that the scheduler has to maximize over for each beam .",
    "this number is fixed and equals the number of users in the full feedback case . however , with selective feedback , it becomes a random quantity .",
    "in other words , selective feedback results in a random effect on the multiuser diversity .",
    "this effect was first observed in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the randomness of multiuser diversity by extremes over random samples and provide a rigorous argument on the rate scaling .",
    "the third problem is further extended to include spectral selectivity by examining a wideband ofdma system , which groups the subcarriers into resource blocks @xcite to form the basic scheduling and feedback unit . in order to save feedback resource",
    "while not significantly degrading the system performance , additional selective feedback in the spectral dimension is necessary .",
    "the effect of random beamforming in a wideband system is examined in @xcite by extensive simulations , and further studied from a utility function perspective with the proportional - fair scheduler in @xcite . in @xcite , analytical results on the asymptotic cluster size is provided . apart from the thresholding - based partial feedback strategy @xcite , the best - l selective feedback strategy @xcite is appealing and utilized in practical systems such as lte @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ the best - l selective feedback strategy to investigate random beamforming and the effect of spectral dimension selective feedback , which calls for an additional maximization stage at the user side to perform feedback selection . in this feedback strategy , only the best beams from the best @xmath2 resource blocks along with the beam and resource block index are fed back from each user . in this paper",
    ", we first derive a closed form rate approximation with exact analysis , i.e. , valid for arbitrary but finite number of users .",
    "then , the influence of the additional spectral dimension selective feedback on the type of convergence is investigated with the technique of tail equivalence . moreover",
    ", the multiplicative effect of selective feedback and random observations is observed to establish the rate scaling .    to summarize , the main contributions of this paper are threefold : the utilization of cdf - based scheduling policy to address heterogeneous users with random beamforming , the obtained closed form rate results with different selective feedback assumptions , and the asymptotic analysis on the randomness of multiuser diversity incurred by selective feedback .",
    "these three contributions analytically examine the raised open problems , and foster further understanding on random beamforming with heterogeneous users and selective feedback .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ system ] reviews the basic narrowband system model for random beamforming .",
    "the analysis for the full feedback case is carried out in section [ full ] , and for the spatial dimension selective feedback in section [ spatial ] .",
    "section [ both ] provides the model for the wideband ofdma with random beamforming , and examines the effect of additional spectral dimension selective feedback on rate performance .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a multi - antenna narrowband gaussian downlink channel with @xmath3 single antenna receivers and a transmitter equipped with @xmath0 antennas . a block fading channel model with coherence interval @xmath4 is assumed .",
    "the random beamforming strategy employs @xmath0 random orthonormal vectors @xmath5 for @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 s are drawn from an isotropic distribution independently every @xmath4 channel uses @xcite . denoting @xmath8 as the @xmath9th transmission symbol at time @xmath10",
    ", the transmitted vector of symbols at time @xmath10 , represented by @xmath11 , is given as @xmath12 let @xmath13 be the received signal at the @xmath14th user , then @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the complex channel vector which is assumed to be known at the receiver , @xmath17 is the additive white noise , and the elements of @xmath18 and @xmath17 are i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian with zero mean and unit variance @xmath19 .",
    "note that this channel assumption corresponds to the rayleigh fading assumption for the small scale channel effect . from now on , the time variable @xmath10 will be dropped for notational convenience .",
    "the total transmit power is chosen to be @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21=1 $ ] , and thus the received signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath22 ) of user @xmath14 is @xmath23 . in a practical downlink setting , due to different locations of users ,",
    "the large scale channel effects @xmath23 which may consist of path loss and shadowing vary across users . from ( [ system_eq_2 ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath1 of the @xmath14th user for the @xmath9th transmit beam can be computed as @xmath24 denote @xmath25 for notational simplicity .",
    "then for a given beam @xmath9 , the @xmath26 s are independent across users @xmath14 but non - identically distributed due to different @xmath23 . for a given user @xmath14 , the @xmath26 s are identically distributed and correlated .",
    "thus the beam index @xmath9 can be dropped in the expression for the pdf , which is computed in @xcite as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the cdf of @xmath29 is shown in @xcite to be @xmath30",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis for the full feedback case wherein each user feeds back the @xmath1 for @xmath0 beams .",
    "since under full feedback , all the beams are fed back , the order statistics for each beam is over @xmath3 independent random variables .",
    "thus this case is well suited for illustration of the scheduling policy and the derivation of the individual sum rate .      after receiving the @xmath31 from user @xmath14 for beam @xmath9 ,",
    "the scheduler is ready to perform user selection . in a homogeneous setting ,",
    "selecting the user with the largest @xmath1 for a given beam maintains fairness and obtains multiuser diversity gain .",
    "this system was analyzed in our recent work @xcite .",
    "the work is now expanded to the more complex heterogeneous case . in a heterogeneous setting , the greedy scheduling policy would be highly unfair for finite @xmath0 .",
    "the round robin scheduling policy can maintain scheduling fairness , but no multiuser diversity gain can be obtained .",
    "the proportional - fair scheduling policy @xcite achieves the system fairness in terms of system utility .",
    "however , under the scenario of inter - beam interference , the users rates are coupled under the proportional - fair scheduling policy .",
    "this coupled effect makes it very difficult , if not impossible , to develop further analytical results .",
    "therefore , to tackle this problem it is useful to consider alternate scheduling policies that decouple each user s rate . in this paper",
    ", we employ the cdf - based scheduling policy @xcite for further analysis . according to this policy",
    ", the scheduler will utilize the distribution of the received @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "it is assumed that the scheduler perfectly knows the cdf , and it performs the following transformation @xcite : @xmath33 the transformed random variable @xmath34 is uniformly distributed ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath20 , and independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) across users for a given beam .",
    "denote @xmath36 as the random variable representing the selected user for beam @xmath9 , then @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the set of users conveying feedback for beam @xmath9 .",
    "in the full feedback case , @xmath39 . after user @xmath36",
    "is selected per ( [ full_eq_2 ] ) , the scheduler utilizes the corresponding @xmath40 for rate matching of the selected user .",
    "let @xmath41 be the @xmath1 of the selected user for beam @xmath9 and now consider the sum rate of the system defined as follows , @xmath42.\\ ] ] from the aforementioned formulation , the sum rate can be computed in the following procedure @xmath43\\notag\\\\ \\label{full_eq_4}&\\mathop{=}\\limits^{(b)}\\frac{m}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^k\\int_0^{\\infty}\\log_2(1+t)d(f_{z_{k}}(t))^k=\\frac{m}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^k\\mathcal{j}_k(k),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( a ) follows from the sufficient small probability that multiple beams are assigned to the same user ; ( b ) follows from the change of variable @xmath44 , the fair property of the cdf - based scheduling , and the following definition for @xmath45 with exponent @xmath46 : @xmath47    with the help of the cdf - based scheduling , each user feels as if the other users have the same cdf for scheduling competition @xcite .",
    "therefore , each user s rate is independent of other users making it possible to consider or predict individual user s rate by only examining its own cdf .",
    "it is clear that the scheduling policy is not only fair , but also acknowledges multiuser diversity at the same time .",
    "if we denote the sum rate as the  macro \" level understanding of the system performance , then the individual user rate can be seen as the  micro \" level understanding of the system performance since this performance metric examines the rate for any specific user and the sum rate can be directly computed from the individual user rate from all the users .",
    "thus , under the cdf - based scheduling policy , each user s rate can be examined separately and this property serves as one building block for further analysis with selective feedback .    in order to demonstrate the multiuser diversity gain for each individual user",
    ", we define the individual sum rate @xmath48 for user @xmath14 which is the individual user rate @xmath49 multiplied by the number of users , as follows @xmath50 the definition of the individual sum rate under the cdf - based scheduling policy makes it natural to examine the rate scaling for each user separately , and also provide a  micro \" level understanding of the sum rate scaling .",
    "compared with the sum rate and the individual user rate which can be treated as performance metrics , the notion of individual sum rate can be regarded as the analytic metric for further scaling analysis .",
    "note that in the homogeneous setting , @xmath45 reduces to @xmath51 .",
    "it is mentioned in previous works that the exact closed form for @xmath52 is hard to obtain due to the coupled effect of @xmath1 and multiuser scheduling . in the sequel , the closed form expression for @xmath45",
    "is obtained which is the key to computing the sum rate given by ( [ full_eq_4 ] ) .",
    "the main technique is employing the following proposed pdf decomposition which readily follows from @xcite .",
    "[ lemma_1 ] ( _ pdf decomposition _ ) @xmath53 can be decomposed as @xmath54    with the help of this pdf decomposition , @xmath45 can be computed in closed form using standard integration techniques whose expression is presented in the following theorem .",

    "remark : _ a few remarks are in order .",
    "firstly , the analytically useful pdf decomposition decouples the effect of multiuser diversity and random beamforming , which facilitates the integration .",
    "the decomposition is general in that it can be applied to other channel models , though in this paper the simple rayleigh channel model is assumed to obtain the @xmath1 statistics in ( [ system_eq_5 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the derived closed from results for the individual sum rate and the sum rate only involve finite sums and factorials , which can readily be computed .",
    "moreover , the derived @xmath45 will be employed as a building block for rate computation in section [ spatial ] and section [ both ] with selective feedback .      with homogeneous setting ,",
    "the asymptotic sum rate scaling is of interest and has been established as @xmath58 @xcite given the @xmath1 statistics in ( [ system_eq_5 ] ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that the multiuser diversity gain is linear with respect to the number of transmit antennas . with heterogeneous setting employing the cdf - based scheduling ,",
    "the same technique can be applied to obtain the asymptotic scaling for the individual sum rate @xmath48 of user @xmath14 .",
    "we now develop the notion of individual rate scaling and state the individual scaling laws under full feedback through the following theorem .",
    "[ theorem_2 ] ( _ individual scaling laws under full feedback _ ) @xmath59    _ remark : _ it is seen from theorem [ theorem_2 ] that users asymptotically follow the same scaling laws in the cdf - based scheduling policy .",
    "the large scale channel effect @xmath23 is not written explicitly in ( [ full_eq_9 ] ) since it is a constant inside the @xmath60 term .",
    "it should briefly be noted that the rate scaling only measures the asymptotic trend when @xmath61 and thus can not accurately match the exact performance for finite regions of @xmath3 .",
    "this section examines selective feedback in the spatial dimension wherein each user only conveys the best beam .",
    "this standard user side selection requires the handling of correlated random variables and the random effect on observations , which are pursued in section [ spatial_rate ] and section [ spatial_scaling ] .      with selective feedback ,",
    "each user selects and feeds back the largest @xmath1 among @xmath0 beams . as discussed in section [ system ] , the @xmath26 s are correlated random variables given @xmath14 .",
