    "a - posteriori analysis of deterministic pde ( partial differential equations ) is a well developed tool .",

    "the strength of the method is usually the derivation of error indicators for the refinement of meshes in adaptive schemes .",
    "see @xcite for an example in a stochastic setting .",
    "also for spdes ( stochastic pdes ) there are recent results on a - posteriori analysis .",
    "the results of @xcite use a - posteriori estimates in polynomial or wiener - chaos expansion , and the results of @xcite show a - posteriori mean square error estimates , where the whole numerical approximation is known ( at least several moments of it ) .",
    "in our work we follow a different more path - wise approach .",
    "we measure the error in mean square conditioned on the calculated numerical data .",
    "given a single realization of the numerical approximation , without using a - priori information on the solution we show analytic bounds , that can be calculated numerically , and guarantee a - posteriori that the true solution is close to the one realization of the numerical approximation , which we calculated . in the numerical example we even get a meaningful result for a relatively poor approximation .",
    "the general philosophy of a - priori error analysis is to use the true solution , which is plugged into the numerical scheme to calculate the residual . then using the discrete in time equation given by the numerical scheme",
    ", we can derive a discrete equation for the error , which has coefficients depending on the true solution . using a - priori information of the solution , asymptotic bounds for the error",
    "are derived . in a - posteriori",
    "analysis we use a time - continuous interpolation of the numerical data , which is plugged into the spde , in order to derive the residual . for the error",
    "we obtain a pde which is continuous in time and has coefficients depending on the numerical data . here",
    "we can use now standard a - priori spde - type methods to derive error bounds , that depend only on numerical data and the residual .",
    "although for simplicity of presentation , we use a much simpler equation of allen - cahn - type , our result is motivated by equations where the global existence of solutions is not known , and thus global a - priori estimates are not available .",
    "typical examples are the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation or a somewhat simpler equation from surface growth @xcite . for the latter in @xcite",
    "a - posteriori analysis was used for the deterministic pdes to prove numerically the regularity of solutions and thus the global existence and uniqueness .    here",
    "we focus as a starting point for simplicity on an one - dimensional equation of allen - cahn type . here",
    "even the asymptotic convergence results of numerical schemes are well known see for example @xcite or @xcite for a truncated scheme .",
    "moreover , there is no problem with existence and uniqueness of solutions .",
    "see for example @xcite .    for the spatial discretization we use the spectral galerkin - scheme , which simplifies the analysis .",
    "moreover , for the time - discretization we use a variant of the exponential scheme introduced by @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , both results should be equivalent , but the variant we use is slightly easier in the analysis .    the precise functional analytic set - up and the equation itself",

    "we provide a bound in moments of the @xmath0-norm , which is conditioned on the given numerical data . in section [ sec : app ] we study the conditional mean square error of the approximation in @xmath1-norm , given the numerical data .",
    "nevertheless , this is a property of the equation and not of the data .",
    "we need to quantify the continuous dependence of solutions on additive perturbations like the stochastic convolution . due to the relatively simple structure of the equation with a stable nonlinearity and a stable linear part ,",
    "this is relatively straightforward .    in the final section ,",
    "we give numerical examples to illustrate the result . here",
    "we use a quite poor discretization given that the solution is very rough and still obtain meaningful error bounds .",
    "the main source of error comes from bounds on term that appear between the discretization points and not at the discrete times where the approximation is calculated .",

    "for the numerical result we focus on space - time white noise of strength @xmath107 , which means that all @xmath26 . moreover , as both the linear part and the nonlinearity are stable , we expect the solution to be of order @xmath107 with rare events , where the solution is larger .",
    "nevertheless , we expect solutions to be quite rough .",
    "due to poor regularity properties , we do not expect the numerical approximation to be very accurate , but still we tried a relatively poor discretization with @xmath213 fourier - modes and relatively large time - steps @xmath214 with a terminal time @xmath215 . here",
    "we intend to show the robustness of the a - posteriori error estimate , which even for this poor discretization yields an almost reasonable result .",
    "first in figure [ fig : km and error ] we plotted the residual @xmath217 for @xmath218 together with the final error .",
    "as expected @xmath217 is small and the error term from theorem [ thm : main ] is bounded by the error term involving @xmath219 and the numerical data .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we plot two terms of the residual @xmath217 , for @xmath218 .",
    "one of the main terms in @xmath217 which depends on the numerical data is @xmath220 , therefore we plot @xmath221 in figure [ fig : residual ] to see impact of this terms on the residual - bound @xmath217 , which seems to be negligible .",
    "moreover in figure [ fig : ou - bridge ] we plot @xmath222 , i.e , the term in @xmath217 which arises from the ou - bridge . by comparing [ fig : km ] and [ fig : ou - bridge ] we can see the impact of the ou - bridge on @xmath217 .",
    "this gives a substantial , but not the most dominant term in @xmath223 .",
    "we can also see that this error term is almost growing linear .",
    "the reason for this is that the part in @xmath100 that depends on the numerical data @xmath224 is quite small and the deterministic part of the estimate bounding the fluctuations dominates the bound .",
    "the final bound for the error @xmath225 $ ] which is stated in theorem [ thm : main ] is plotted in figure [ fig : average error ] for @xmath226 simulations .",
    "it confirms that ( as expected ) the numerical approximation we studied is poor and still far away from the asymptotic regime , but nevertheless it gives an almost meaningful result , as the error is smaller that the solution .",
    "we also see in figure [ fig : average error ] that the error is not growing with constant speed , but it has parts where it grows much faster .",
    "this effect is also very well visible in figure [ fig : residual ] , although the effect there is too small to have an impact on @xmath176 .",
    "we have no explanation for this behavior , which might be a rare large deviation effect .",
    "to see exactly impact of each term of @xmath176 in it s value in figure [ fig : km terms ] values of @xmath176 , @xmath227 and each of it s terms are plotted . also in table [ t1 ]",
    "values of each term at the final time @xmath215 is stated for @xmath228 simulations .",
    ".values of four simulations of @xmath176 and each of it s term at the final time @xmath215 , i.e , @xmath234 .",
    "the contribution of error at discretization points is @xmath235 for the part determined by the data and @xmath236 for the stochastics on the high modes .",
    "the next two error terms @xmath237 and @xmath238    \\big)^{1/4}$ ] are data controlled terms for error that arises between discretization points . as the step size is quite large",
    "these terms seem to dominate although in @xmath239 they seem to be of smaller order .",
    "finally @xmath240 bounding the stochastic fluctuation in between is not that large as we would expected it to be . [",
