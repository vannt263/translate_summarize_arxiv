    "the low - hard state of accreting black holes is characterized by the presence of a hot corona around the compact object .",
    "figure [ fig : geometria ] shows a scheme of the main components of the system . for this geometry ,",
    "we assume a spherical corona with a radius @xmath0 and an accretion disk that penetrates the corona up to a radius @xmath1 .",
    "we suppose that the corona is homogeneous and in steady state .",
    "we assume that the luminosity of the corona is 1 % of the eddington luminosity of the black hole . for a corona characterized by the parameters of table [ tab_1 ] , this yields @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the corona is composed of a two - temperature plasma , with an electron temperature @xmath4 k and an ion temperature @xmath5 k ( e.g. ref . ) .",
    "this is a consequence of electron cooling being more efficient than proton .    in the low - hard state",
    "we can assume the system is in a steady state .",
    "we then consider equipartition of energy between the different components of the system and obtain the values of the relevant physical parameters .",
    "the x - rays emission of the corona is characterized by a power law with an exponential cut - off at high energies , @xmath6 in accordance with what is observed in cygnus x-1 ( e.g. ref . ) , we adopt @xmath7 and @xmath8 kev .",
    "table [ tab_1 ] shows the values of the parameters in our model .",
    "the injection function for relativistic protons and electrons is a power - law in the energy of the particles @xmath9 , which is the consequence of diffusive particle acceleration by shock waves in the coronal plasma .",
    "typical spectral indices are @xmath10 ( ref . ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath11 can be obtained from the total power injected in relativistic protons and electrons , @xmath12 .",
    "this power @xmath13 was assumed to be a fraction of the luminosity of the corona , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "the way in which energy is divided between hadrons and leptons is unknown , but different scenarios can be taken into account by setting @xmath16 .",
    "we consider models with an injection dominated by protons in which @xmath17 and models with @xmath18 .",
    "the injected particles will lose their energy by different radiative processes .",
    "there are three relevant processes of interaction of relativistic electrons with magnetic , matter and photon fields in this scenario : synchrotron radiation , inverse compton scattering , and relativistic bremsstrahlung . for protons",
    "there are also three relevant processes : synchrotron radiation , proton - proton inelastic collisions and photohadronic interactions .",
    "these interactions produce pions , which then decay producing muons .",
    "we also consider the energy loss of these particles ; the processes for charged pions are the same as for protons and for muons the same as for electrons .",
    "we consider two mechanisms of particle escape from the corona : advection and diffusion . in the case of advection , particles fall onto the compact object at a mean radial velocity @xmath19 ( ref . ) .",
    "therefore the advection rate is    @xmath20    in the case of diffusion , we consider that the corona is static and diffusion of relativistic particles occurs in the bohm regime .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the giroradius of the particle .",
    "the diffusion rate is    @xmath23    figure [ fig : perdidas ] shows the cooling rates for different processes of energy loss , along with the acceleration and escape rates , for each type of particle considered . under the physical conditions previously described , the main channel of energy loss for electrons is synchrotron radiation . for protons ,",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 interactions are relevant .",
    "however , in the model with advection , most protons fall into the black hole before radiating their energy . for pions ,",
    "the main channel of energy loss is @xmath26 interaction , but an important fraction of pions decay before cooling . on the contrary , muons with energies above @xmath27",
    "ev cool mostly by inverse compton scattering .",
    "+    the maximum energy that a relativistic particle can attain depends on the acceleration mechanism and the different processes of energy loss .",
    "the acceleration rate @xmath28 for a particle of energy @xmath29 in a magnetic field @xmath30 is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a parameter that characterizes the efficiency of the acceleration .",
    "we have fixed @xmath33 , which describes an efficient acceleration .",
    "in order to obtain the spectral energy distributions produced by the different radiative processes , we solve the transport equation for each kind of particle .",
    "we calculate the seds of different processes following ref .",
    "( ) as standard reference .",
    "we also calculate the radiation emitted by secondary pairs , which are injected mainly by photon - photon annihilations .",
    "+    figure [ fig : seds ] shows all contributions to the total luminosity for different advection regimes and for different values of the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "luminosities produced by hadrons and muons are higher in models with diffusion .",
    "this is because in models with advection an important fraction of protons and pions are swallowed by the black hole , while with diffusion these particles are able to lose their energy before falling into the compact object or escaping .    finally , we take into account the effects of photon - photon attenuation .",
    "the absorption can be quantified through the opacity @xmath35 .",
    "if the initial gamma - ray luminosity is @xmath36 , the attenuated luminosity @xmath37 after the photon travels a distance @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig : todas ] shows the attenuated luminosity for each set of parameters , the spectrum of cygnus x-1 as observed by comptel ( ref . ) , and the sensitivity of different instruments .",
    "notice that in addition of accounting for the mev tail observed by comptel , a high energy bump with luminosities @xmath40 erg s@xmath3 is expected at @xmath41 tev .",
    "the existence of the high - energy tail in the spectrum detected by comptel and reproduced by our model was recently confirmed by observations with integral satellite ( ref . ) .",
    "on one hand , the sed predicted by the model with an injection dominated by protons and diffusion reproduces the observations of cygnus x-1 . on the other hand ,",
    "our model predicts a high energy emission , above 1 tev , that might be detectable by instruments like magic ii or cta in the near future .",
