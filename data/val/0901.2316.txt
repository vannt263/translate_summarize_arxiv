    "electromagnetic ( em ) probes , i.e. , photons and lepton pairs ( dileptons ) , do not participate in the strong interaction and can therefore mediate valuable information on the em current correlator in the interior of the hot and dense fireball created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics )  @xcite ; their spectra are nearly unaffected by final - state interactions .    in this paper our present theoretical understanding of recent data on invariant - mass ( @xmath0 ) and transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra of dileptons in urhics at",
    "the cern sps and bnl rhic will be reviewed .",
    "the emission rate of dileptons with an invariant mass @xmath2 and three - momentum , @xmath3 , from a medium at temperature @xmath4 is given by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the fine - structure constant , @xmath7 the lepton - phase space factor , @xmath8 the retarded in - medium em current correlator , and @xmath9 the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "in the vacuum the hadronic em correlator can be inferred from @xmath10 . at low @xmath0",
    "it is well - described by the vector dominance model ( vdm ) , including the light vector mesons , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and at higher @xmath14 by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) continuum .",
    "the theoretical investigation of the dilepton signal in urhics thus must aim at a concise model for the spectral properties of the light vector mesons , most importantly the @xmath11 meson in the iso - vector - vector channel , which give the most important contribution to the em current correlator , and of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_medium ] theoretical models for the em current correlator in partonic as well as hot and/or dense hadronic matter are summarized , followed by a comparison to recent dilepton data from the sps in sec .",
    "[ sec_dileps - hics ] and conclusions and outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec_concl ] .",
    "approximate chiral symmetry ( cs ) in the light - quark sector of qcd is one of the most important ingredients for the building of effective hadronic models . in the vacuum and at low temperatures and/or densities",
    "cs is broken dynamically through the formation of a quark condensate , @xmath15 , leading to the mass splitting of the mass spectra of chiral hadron multiplets .",
    "one of the most evident manifestations of cs breaking is seen in the measurement of the isovector - vector and -axialvector current correlators through @xmath16-decay data ( @xmath17 : number of pions )  @xcite .",
    "finite - temperature lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) calculations  @xcite find a melting of the quark condensate with increasing temperature and the restoration of cs above a critical temperature , @xmath18-@xmath19 .",
    "another finding is that the cs restoration ( csr ) and deconfinement transition temperatures , coincide  @xcite . from these findings",
    "one expects significant changes of the hadron spectra in a hot and dense medium close to csr .    in the literature ,",
    "two scenarios concerning the manifestation of csr in the hadron spectrum have emerged : in one scenario it has been suggested that due to the melting of the quark condensate hadron masses should drop to @xmath20 at the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the other mechanism is found in phenomenological hadronic many - body models , where hadron spectral functions show a significant broadening with small mass shifts  @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that both scenarios , i.e. , either dropping masses or the broadening of in - medium hadron widths ( `` melting resonances '' ) are compatible with qcd - sum rule calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus the dilepton signal in urhics gives an important experimental insight into the nature of the csr through the vector part of the em current correlator .",
    "since on the other hand a direct measurement of the axialvector correlation function in heavy - ion collisions is difficult , a direct assessment of csr in hic s seems not to be possible .",
    "thus , a promising theoretical evidence for csr may be achievable by the application of finite - temperature weinberg - sum rules  @xcite which relate moments of the difference of vector and axial - vector spectral functions to order parameters of cs like quark and four - quark condensates , which are in principle accessible in lqcd simulations .    a model - independent approach to the em current correlator is the use of the chiral - reduction formalism based on a low - density ( virial ) expansion  @xcite to evaluate medium modifications with empirical vacuum - vector and axialvector - correlation functions as input . in this approach a mechanism for csr is the mixing of the vector and axialvector correlators through pions in the medium , similar to the `` chiral mixing '' found on the basis of current algebra and pcac  @xcite .",
    "however , the applicability of such methods is limited to the low - density / temperature region of the medium .",
    "thus the building of effective hadronic models and the application of quantum - field theory methods becomes necessary to assess the dilepton signal in urhics realistically .",
    "the most important guideline for building effective hadronic models is cs , e.g. , using ( generalized ) hidden local symmetry  @xcite to describe vector ( and axial - vector ) mesons as gauge bosons .",
    "recently , it has been shown that within these models cs can be realized in the vector manifestation ( vm ) , leading to a field - theoretical model for the dropping - mass scenario of csr  @xcite .",
    "however , the same model also admits the usual wigner - weyl realization , where one finds degeneracy of the @xmath11 and @xmath21 spectral functions with little mass shifts  @xcite . in general , this finding suggests that a decision in which way cs is realized in nature and how it is restored can not be achieved from the fundamental principle of cs alone .",
    "another approach is the use of phenomenological lagrangians which describe the vacuum properties of the vector mesons and evaluate medium modifications of their spectral functions within finite - temperature / density quantum field theory . to account for the strong couplings ,",
    "hadronic many - body theory ( hmbt ) implements non - perturbative techniques like the dressing of , e.g. , the pion propagator in the @xmath11-meson s pion cloud , as well as a resummation of direct interactions of the @xmath11 with mesons and baryons of the medium ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "one finds small mass shifts of the vector mesons due to many repulsive and attractive interactions with cancellations in the real part of the vector - meson self - energy , but a substantial broadening of their spectral functions .",
    "an interesting result of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite is the apparent degeneracy of the pertinent hadronic dilepton - emission rates and that of hard - thermal - loop improved pqcd rates  @xcite at temperatures close to the critical region , @xmath22-@xmath23 , in a kind of `` quark - hadron duality '' , implying csr through `` resonance melting '' .",
    "this finding is consistent with the smoothness of the isovector quark - number susceptibility in lqcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to assess in - medium properties of vector mesons is to employ empirical scattering amplitudes and dispersion - integral techniques within the @xmath24 approximation for the in - medium selfenergies  @xcite .",
    "to confront the in - medium em spectral functions from the above models to dilepton @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra in urhics a description of the entire evolution of the produced medium in its hadronic and partonic stages is necessary .",
    "the success of ( ideal ) hydrodynamics in the evaluation of the bulk of this matter implies local thermal equilibrium , i.e. , the medium can be modeled by an energy - density and collective - flow field . in  @xcite",
    "a thermal fireball parameterization has been used . after a formation time the hot and dense matter is described as an ideal gas of quarks and gluons , evolving through a mixed phase to a hadron - resonance gas at a transition temperature of @xmath22-@xmath19 . as thermal - model evaluations of particle abundances in urhics indicate , the chemical freeze - out temperature is about @xmath25-@xmath26  @xcite , below which the particle ratios are fixed through the introduction of chemical potentials . the thermal freeze - out temperature , around which also elastic rescatterings cease , occurs at temperatures of @xmath27-@xmath28 .",
    "the evolution of the medium is parameterized as a cylindrical homogeneous fireball which is longitudinally and radially expanding .",
    "the temperature is given via the assumption of isentropic expansion and the equation of state of an ideal gas of massless gluons and @xmath29 effective quark flavors with the total entropy fixed by the number of charged particles .",
    "after a mixed phase , which is described by a standard volume partition , the hadronic phase is modeled as a hadron - resonance gas .    early on , measurements of dilepton @xmath0 spectra in urhics at the sps have shown an indication of medium modifications via an increased yield in the low - mass region ( lmr ) , @xmath30 , compared to expectations from @xmath31 collisions  @xcite . however",
    ", only the recent precision achieved in the dimuon measurement of the na60 collaboration in @xmath32 in - in collisions  @xcite has made it possible to subtract the `` hadron - decay cocktail '' contribution to obtain the excess spectrum and thus to significantly discriminate between models of the dropping - mass or the resonance - melting scenarios for csr .",
    "the data clearly favor small mass shifts and a substantial broadening of the vector - meson spectral functions .",

    "[ fig.1 ] we compare the absolutely normalized mass spectrum  @xcite to the following models ( i ) ref .",
    "@xcite , using spectral functions from hmbt  @xcite supplemented with thermal radiation from multi - pion induced processes and non - thermal sources ( drell - yan annihilation , decays of primordial @xmath11 mesons not equilibrated with the medium and @xmath11 decays after thermal freeze - out ) , ( ii ) ref .",
    "@xcite , implementing spectral functions from the @xmath24 approach in  @xcite , and ( iii ) ref .",
    "@xcite , where the chiral - reduction formalism has been applied . for the medium evolution in ( i ) and ( ii ) fireball models are used , while in ( iii ) a hydrodynamical calculation is employed .",
    "the predicted broadening of the em correlator , particularly in model ( i ) at low masses , is dominated by baryonic excitations of the vector mesons in the medium .    in the same figure , @xmath36 spectra ( @xmath37 ) in different mass bins",
    "have been compared to the model in  @xcite .",
    "the latter also contains studies of the sensitivity to uncertainties in ( a ) @xmath38 as determined in present lqcd simulations , and ( b ) @xmath39 as extracted from thermal models for hadron production .",
    "three equations of state with @xmath40 ( eos - a ) , @xmath41 ( eos - b ) , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( eos - c ) have been used . in eos - c a chemically equilibrated hadronic phase in the temperature region @xmath44 has been assumed . the comparison to the @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath36 spectra is qualitatively comparable to that of eos - a ( up to small variations of the total dilepton yields which could be readjusted by small changes of the fireball lifetime )",
    ". an interesting consequence of this insensitivity to @xmath38 and @xmath39 is that the dimuon spectrum in the intermediate - mass region ( imr ) @xmath45 can be equally well described with models where the dilepton yield is either dominated by radiation from a partonic ( eos - b ) or a hadronic ( eos - c ) source . since the emission in this @xmath0 region is dominated from fireball stages with temperatures around the critical region , @xmath46-@xmath47 , this insensitivity is due to the above described `` parton - hadron duality '' of the dilepton rates within this model .",
    "thus , a definite conclusion whether the dileptons in the imr are dominated by radiation from a partonic or hadronic medium can only be drawn if a more precise value of @xmath38 is known .    as shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig.2 ] shows a comparison of the same model to the recent dielectron spectrum in central @xmath48 pb - au collisions from the na45/ceres collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the result of the same model _ without _ the interactions of the @xmath11 meson with baryons in the medium corroborates their prevalence for the broadening of the @xmath11-spectral function , in a very pronounced way in the mass region below the two - pion threshold .",
    "the comparison of effective hadronic models for in - medium properties of the em current - correlation function with high precision dilepton data in urhics is a promising method to gain insights in the nature of csr .",
    "models based on hadronic many - body theory , predicting a strong broadening of the vector - meson spectral functions with little mass shifts , are favored by recent measurements compared to those implementing the dropping - mass conjecture . however , a more complete analysis of the generalized hidden - local symmetry model with the vector manifestation of cs , leading to dropping vector and axialvector masses , including baryonic interactions is not available yet .",
    "the large enhancement of the dilepton yield in the lmr , recently observed by phenix in @xmath49 au - au collisions at rhic  @xcite , to date can not be explained by any of the models which are successful at the sps .",
    "the extension of the present models to axialvector mesons , constrained by lqcd calculations of chiral order parameters in connection with weinberg sum rules , might help to deduce more direct evidence for csr from the dilepton signal in urhics .",
