    "most of these works about relativistic quantum information theory ( rqit ) concentrated on the quantum state itself .",
    "rqit maybe necessary in future practical experiments .",
    "it has been shown that the fidelity of quantum teleportation with a uniformly accelerated partner is reduced due to davies - unruh radiation @xcite .",
    "other possible applications include quantum clock synchronization @xcite , quantum - enhanced communication @xcite and global positioning @xcite .",
    "quantum decoherence is closely related to several fundamental problems in quantum mechanics , e.g. quantum measurement and quantum to classical transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of decoherence in combination with special relativity is naturally of interest and importance @xcite , which may help gain new insights into the fundamental issues of modern theoretic physics .",
    "it is known that quantum systems coupled with an external environment will suffer from inevitable decoherence , which is the most severe obstacle to implementing quantum computation .",
    "a famous strategy to fight against decoherence is quantum dynamical decoupling by applying different control operations , including spin echo and bang - bang control @xcite .",
    "given a single spin-@xmath0 dirac electron with the rest mass @xmath1 , we could realize the qubit by the spin up and down along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "if the dirac electron is coupled with an noisy magnetic environment , the coherence of the spin - qubit will be lost . in conventional quantum information theory ( cqit )",
    ", people always assume that the central quantum system is at rest . in this paper",
    ", we present the time evolution of the spin state of a _ moving _ dirac electron .",
    "it can be seen that the decoherence properties is significantly modified by special relativity .",
    "we demonstrate that the dressed environment induced by special relativity will suppress the spin decoherence .",
    "one should note that , the problem we consider here is different from the gravitational decoherence @xcite , which results from quantum metric fluctuations and unruh effect .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we demonstrate the spin dephasing of a rest electron . in sec .",
    "iii the influences of special relativity on the spin decoherence properties is investigated by presenting its dynamical behavior in the operator - sum representation form . in sec .",
    "iv are conclusions and some discussions .",
    "we start by considering the decoherence process for the spin degree of freedom of an electron with a background magnetic noise . in cqit ,",
    "the electron is always assumed to be at rest .",
    "since the spin magnetic moment of the electron is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the electronic charge , its interaction with a magnetic field @xmath5 is described by the following simple hamiltonian @xmath6where @xmath7 are pauli matrices .",
    "if the noisy background magnetic field is @xmath8 in the @xmath2 direction with gaussian probability distribution @xmath9 , and under quasi - static approximation @xcite , we can write the spin state of the electron at time @xmath10 as a completely positive map with an operator - sum representation @xmath11where @xmath12 is the initial spin state , and the parameters @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "here we have set @xmath18 for simplicity .",
    "this kind of decoherence model , named dephasing , is very important and has been widely investigated in cqit @xcite . in the dephasing process , the diagonal elements of the spin density matrix remain unchanged .",
    "the decoherence is reflected by the off - diagonal elements , which will decay exponentially as @xmath19 until @xmath20 in the long time limit @xmath21 , i.e. the spin state becomes classically mixed .",
    "to deal with the relativistic dirac electron moving at a constant velocity @xmath22 relative to the rest frame @xmath23 , we should adopt the dirac equation for the electron in external homogeneous static fields . after choosing a suitable reference frame @xmath24 ,",
    "the dirac hamiltonian in foldy - wouthuysen representation greiner is @xmath25where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represents the electric field .",
    "the above hamiltonian is a non - relativistic expansion to order @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the relative velocity of the electron in the reference frame @xmath24 .",
    "it is convenient for us to investigate the dynamical properties of the dirac electron in the the moving inertial frame @xmath30 with the velocity @xmath31 relative to the rest frame @xmath23 , in which the electron is at rest , i.e. @xmath32 . by virtue of the foldy - wouthuysen representation , we only need to consider the positive energy states . for the spin and momentum eigen state @xmath33 , of which @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "after time @xmath10 , the evolution of the state is @xmath36 .",
    "the momentum phase @xmath37 becomes trivial when tracing out the momentum degree of freedom .    in the rest frame",
    "@xmath23 , the magnetic field is @xmath8 in the @xmath2 direction , thus the fields viewed in the moving frame @xmath30 can be obtained according to the lorentz transformations greiner2 as follows @xmath38where @xmath39 and @xmath40 mean parallel and perpendicular to @xmath31 , the rapidity @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 . after some straightforward calculations , and note that @xmath43 , we get the effective hamiltonian for the spin degree of freedom of the dirac electron @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the above effective interaction hamiltonian means that from the viewpoint of the moving dirac electron , the environment is different compared to the situation when the electron is at rest due to the relativity of the magnetic field . in the following , we will investigate in detail how this kind of effects will modify the dynamical properties of the spin decoherence .",
    "the interaction with the external magnetic field @xmath48 will introduce a rotation on the spin by @xmath49 about the @xmath50 axis as @xmath51where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the rotation angle is @xmath56 . in the similar way ,",
    "the noisy background magnetic field @xmath57 is with gaussian probability distribution , and under quasi - static approximation @xcite , we can write the spin state of the moving dirac electron at time @xmath10 as@xmath58where @xmath59 and @xmath12 denotes the initial spin state .",
    "we first examine the diagonal elements by calculating @xmath60 . according to eq.([rt ] ) , it is easy for us to write @xmath61 , where @xmath62 $ ] with two modulation factors defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . after integrating over the magnetic field @xmath57 with gaussian probability distribution ,",
    "we obtain @xmath65where @xmath66 .",
    "the first term is just the same as the dephasing process in cqit , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "however , the second item in eq.([de ] ) indicates that the diagonal elements will change as time , which is a different decoherence source introduced by the effects of special relativity . in the long time",
    "limit @xmath68 , the spin up population will decrease @xmath69 .",
    "now we turn to the off - diagonal elements , in the similar way we can obtain @xmath70\\sin \\delta $ ] , where @xmath71 $ ] . after integrating over the gaussian magnetic field @xmath57",
    ", we obtain @xmath72the first term of @xmath73 is in a similar form of exponential decay , except that the decay rate changes to @xmath74 .",
    "the effects of special relativity is also reflected by the second term , which implies that when @xmath75 , @xmath76 that is a saturation value other than zero , i.e. the off - diagonals will not vanish . from the evolution of diagonal and off - diagonal elements in eqs.([de],[nde ] ) , we can establish a physical picture of the above analyses by expressing the spin density matrix at time @xmath10 in the operator - sum representation@xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the operators @xmath81 are @xmath82^{1/2}(\\cos \\varphi \\sigma _ { x}+\\sin \\varphi \\sigma _ { y})$ ] and @xmath83 .",
    "if the velocity of the electron @xmath67 , the modulation factor @xmath84 , and the above results reduce to the pure dephasing of a rest spin . when we consider a moving electron , the first two terms in eq.([osr ] )",
    "is similar to pure dephasing .",
    "however , the decay rate of the off - diagonal elements is amplified by the factor @xmath85 .",
    "the suppression of dephasing stems from the third term @xmath86 .",
    "the other two operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 in eq.([osr ] ) represent different decoherence mechanisms which makes the spin suffer from other decoherence than pure dephasing .",
    "we could also formulate the evolution of the spin state of the moving electron as in the dressed environment    @xmath89^{\\kappa } ( v\\rho v^{\\dagger } ) [ \\exp ( i\\frac{\\delta _ { 0}}{2}\\sigma _ { z})]^{\\kappa } \\eta ( b)db\\right\\ } v\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 $ ] is the dressing transformation , @xmath91 is the angle between the axes @xmath92 and @xmath2 . from the viewpoint of qubit , after the control operation @xmath93 , the initial state @xmath94 will undergo pure dephasing in the dressed hilbert space , the final reverse operation @xmath95 will recover some coherence information in the original hilbert space .",
    "the modulation factors @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the key ingredients that characterize the influence of special relativity .",
    "fig 2 shows the modulation factor @xmath96 as a function of the rapidity @xmath41 and @xmath98 . for a given rapidity @xmath41 , the modulation factor",
    "@xmath99 $ ] .",
    "we are interested in the maximum value of the modulation factor @xmath96 .",
    "thus we consider the first order partial differential equation @xmath100 , which leads to @xmath101 , and the corresponding maximum value of @xmath96 is@xmath102we plot the maximum value @xmath103 for various rapidity @xmath41 in the following fig 3(a ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath103 always increases monotonically as the rapidity @xmath41 grows . in the limit @xmath104 ,",
    "i.e. the velocity is close to the light velocity @xmath105 , the maximum modulation factor @xmath103 reaches the constant value @xmath14 .    for the angle @xmath98 of the velocity @xmath106 that maximize the value of @xmath107 , the corresponding value of the other modulation factor @xmath108 is @xmath109 .",
    "when we consider the relativistic dirac electron , i.e. the velocity @xmath106 is comparable to the light velocity @xmath110 , @xmath111 , which can be neglected in some sense .",
    "_ example _ to explicitly demonstrate the influence of special relativity on the spin decoherence of a moving dirac electron , we consider a spin qubit in a fully coherent initial state @xmath112 . we could have chosen a more general initial spin state with different relative amplitudes .",
    "however , the above state gives rise to all interesting physical features in the situation considered here .",
    "we set the velocity angle @xmath113 to maximize the modulus of the saturation value of off - diagonal elements , thus @xmath114 \\\\",
    "\\rho _ { \\uparrow \\downarrow } ( t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}[(1-\\eta ) e^{-\\gamma ^{\\prime } t^{2}}+\\eta ] \\end{aligned}\\]]we plot the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the spin density matrix in fig 3(b ) , and compare two cases when the rapidity @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the velocity angle @xmath98 is set to maximize the modulation factor @xmath96 . in the short time region ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements decay much faster , which is due to the amplification of @xmath117by the factor @xmath118 .",
    "however , as the time is longer , the decay of the off - diagonal elements will be much suppressed . in particular ,",
    "if the time is sufficiently long , for @xmath116 , the spin degree of freedom becomes completely classical ; while for @xmath115 , the off - diagonal elements will reach a nonzero saturation value @xmath119 , and the spin state becomes steady , which suggests that the decoherence process seems halting .",
    "the above discussions are extensible to the situation of several spin-@xmath0 dirac electrons coupled with one common gaussian background magnetic noise , i.e. @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "for example , we consider two electrons in the spin entangled state @xmath121 moving at the same velocity , if the electrons are at rest , the two - qubit entanglement quantified by the concurrence will decay exponentially as @xmath122 @xcite . in order to highlight the effects of special relativity , we assume that @xmath123 , thus the modulation factors are @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "after simple calculations , it is easy to obtain the evolution of the two - qubit entanglement as @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , unlike the situation of a single electron , the effects of special relativity will makes @xmath127 much more quickly .",
    "the existing research in the field of rqit focused on the effects of special relativity on the _ static _ properties of quantum states , e.g. von neumann entropy and quantum entanglement . in this work",
    ", we investigate the _ dynamic _ properties , i.e. decoherence process of a moving dirac electron .",
    "the decoherence mechanisms will be significantly modified due to the _ dressed environment _ , which leads to the intriguing phenomenon that the coherent information will be preserved even as the electron is in the noisy environment for sufficiently long time .",
    "the extension of this work to general decoherence models will enlarge the research scope of relativistic quantum information theory , and may establish fundamental connections between special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
