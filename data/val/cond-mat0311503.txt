    "in recent years it has become possible to fabricate devices in which the active element is a very small organic molecule @xcite .",
    "such a device may be thought of as a quantum dot : a structure weakly coupled to the macroscopic charge reservoirs ( leads ) and small enough that the discrete nature of the energy levels on the dot is important .",
    "quantum dots fabricated using conventional semiconductor technology have been extensively studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite.however , the use of small molecules may lead to new physics . in particular , as electrons are added or removed from a small molecule , both the _ shape _ of the molecule and its _ position _ relative to the leads may be altered .",
    "the energies associated with these changes are not small , and the time scales may be comparable to those related to the flow of electrons into and out of the molecule .",
    "interesting recent data indicate that these effects may lead to observable structures in the conductance spectra of the dot @xcite .",
    "the shape change may be thought of as a coupling of electrons on the molecule to phonon modes of the molecule , while the position change corresponds to phonon dependent tunneling matrix elements .",
    "the subject of electron - phonon coupling in quantum dots has received much theoretical attention @xcite . in an early important work glazman and shekhter obtained analytic expressions for the transmission probability through the dot under conditions that the phonons are always in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "their results for the transmission go a long way towards describing the behavior of the phonon - coupled system when one is far from resonance .",
    "however their treatment neglects the phonon renormalization of the dot - lead coupling , and thus gives rise to a zero bias conductance at resonance that is smaller than the value predicted by the breit - wigner formula ( this situation was not the main interest of @xcite ) .",
    "( these issues were also recently discussed by flensberg @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of renormalization of the dot - lead coupling appears in the treatment carried out by other authors as well @xcite , and in addition some authors assert ( incorrectly , we believe ) that phonon sidebands may be observed even in the linear - response conductance @xcite by tuning the gate voltage .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of the phonon coupled dot .",
    "we present a comprehensive formalism valid both in the classical and quantal limits which resolves the ambiguities in the present literature .",
    "we also use this formalism to address new issues related to the behavior of this system under strongly non - equilibrium conditions in the quantal and classical regime .",
    "we further study the nature of the quantal - classical crossover and the noise spectra .",
    "an important feature of our results in the quantum regime is that the conductance peak height at resonance is unchanged by electron - phonon interactions .    a recent paper by mccarthy et al .",
    "@xcite treats the problem of the phonon coupled dot in the high - t classical regime and for phonons that couple to the leads .",
    "they present results for the regime of `` equilibrated '' phonons strongly coupled to a heat bath .",
    "the high - t regime of our work is similar to that of reference @xcite , but we also study the physics of out of equilibrium phonons .",
    "aji et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the model under off - resonant conditions when the conductance is very low and the current is due to elastic / inelastic cotunneling .",
    "they study the phonon sidebands in the case of equilibrated and unequilibrated phonons , for the case of an electron coupled to a molecular vibrational mode ( our model ) and also the case of a phonon dependent tunneling amplitude . in our analysis ,",
    "the exact treatment of the leads automatically takes into account cotunneling processes , while the perturbative approximation restricts our analysis to details of the first phonon sideband .",
    "we show how thermal effects wash out cotunneling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model ( sub - section a ) , the important model parameters ( sub - section b ) and develop a density matrix formalism ( sub - section c ) that allows one to obtain the probability distribution for various states on the dot under out of equilibrium conditions .",
    "in section - iii we apply the high temperature approximation in the density matrix formalism and derive the rate equations for the dot occupation probabilities in the sequential tunneling regime ( sub - section a ) .",
    "we use these rate equations to calculate average current ( sub - section b ) and the dc noise power ( sub - section c ) as functions of gate and source - drain voltage for two limiting cases : phonons equilibrated to the external world independent of the electron occupation ( phonon equilibration fast compared to dwell time of electron on molecule ) , and phonons uncoupled from the external world and responding only to on - dot electrons ( phonon equilibration slow compared to dwell time of electron on dot ) .",
    "we find that in the case of phonons uncoupled from a bath , under certain bias conditions the phonon distribution can deviate far from equilibrium .",
    "section - iv deals with the low temperature quantal regime of the phonon coupled dot where we use the keldysh green s function technique to calculate the dc - current and phonon distribution function to leading order in the ratio of ( electron - phonon coupling)/(tunneling rate to the leads ) for the two cases of slow and fast phonon equilibration rate .",
    "section iv is split into sub - section a that re - introduces the problem , sub - section b that derives expressions for the exact eigenstates in the absence of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "these eigenstates form a convenient basis for carrying out the perturbative keldysh calculation which is outlined in sub - section c. sub - sections d and e present results for i - v for the two cases of slow and fast phonon equilibration rates .",
    "finally section v studies the crossover from low - t to high - t regimes and section vi is a summary of our work and its relation to already existing literature .",
    "we consider the case of a molecule with a single level of degeneracy @xmath0 coupled to two leads , which we label as left ( l )  and right ( r). we suppose that the electrons are coupled to two different kinds of phonons ; an internal vibrational mode of the molecule of frequency @xmath1 , which couples to the local charge , and a phonon mode labeled by a displacement operator @xmath2 , that accounts for the oscillations of the dot in an external confining potential of parabolicity @xmath3 .",

    "the behaviour of the models we consider is specified by two important dimensionless parameters : the ratio of the temperature @xmath27 to a typical decay time @xmath28 , and the product of the dimensionaless coupling @xmath29 and the ratio of the phonon frequency @xmath1 to @xmath28 . for large values of @xmath30 a classical rate equation analysis may be employed for all values of @xmath31 ; this is the subject of section iii . for small values of @xmath30",

    "we are able to obtain results ( figs [ fig : cotun ] , [ fig : ineq ] , [ fig : creq ] for the i - v characteristics including both the `` direct tunneling '' ( @xmath370 or conversely ) and `` cotunneling '' regimes ( @xmath371 or conversely ) and were able to treat the quantal to classical crossover ( figs [ fig : r ] ,  [ fig : creq ] , [ fig : crneq ] ) .",
    "we presented both a diagrammatic ( keldysh ) calculation and a solution based on the construction of exact eigenstates , and confirmed that the peculiar broadening of the phonon distribution found in the `` unequilibrated classical '' case survives also in the quantum limit .      in this section",
    "we consider the relation of our results to the extensive existing theoretical literature .",
    "the subject was pioneered by glazman and shekter @xcite who showed that the problem of a single electron transiting a resonant level and coupled to phonons can be solved in complete analytic detail .",
    "they determined the form of the phonon side - bands in the transmission amplitude and showed how the resonant behaviour was modified by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "very similar results were subsequently obtained by wingreen , jacobsen and wilkins @xcite .",
    "however the single electron approximation used in these papers is not applicable to the case of leads containing a fermi sea of electrons .",
    "the presence of other electrons blocks some of the intermediate states in the electron- phonon scattering process , changing the form of the eigenstates and crucially blocks some of the final states in the transmission process .",
    "this blocking ensures that the @xmath358 linear response conductance at resonance takes the quantized value if @xmath372 , whereas the on resonance transmission probabilities calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite are less than unity .",
    "this issue was very recently also discussed by flensberg @xcite .",
    "one crucial consequence of the presence of fermi seas in the leads is the `` floating '' of the phonon side - bands in the electron spectral function and thus in the iv curve . at @xmath373 ,",
    "the features in the spectral function occur at energies displaced from the fermi - level by integer multiples of the phonon frequency , thus the corresponding steps in the iv curve are observed when @xmath140 is swept , but are not observed if @xmath144 ( i.e. , the mean lead fermi level ) is changed at fixed small @xmath140 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gvg ] ) .",
    "several authors @xcite employ approximations to the electron green s function corresponding roughly to those of glazman and shekhter or wingreen and coworkers .",
    "these miss the above physics and erroneously predicts phonon side - bands as @xmath144 is varied @xcite .    as also noted by flensberg the approximations employed by refs .",
    "@xcite amount to writing the dot green s function as @xmath374 ( where the operators @xmath99 have been defined in eq .",
    "[ xdef ] ) .",
    "this approximation becomes exact in the high temperature limit , and can be used as the starting point of an alternative derivation of the rate equations .",
    "however some of the literature @xcite who have used this approach have treated the x - operator matrix elements in an approximate manner which does not capture the structure giving rise to the step height variations displayed in our fig .",
    "[ fig : g ] .    finally gogolin and komnik",
    "have used an adiabatic ( slow phonons , fast electrons ) semiclassical approximation to explore the strongly electron - phonon coupled regime .",
    "it is well known that at strong coupling the energy as a function of phonon coordinate become bistable , signaling the onset of polaronic instability .",
    "@xcite considered the behaviour of the polaronic state under non - equilibrium conditions , and observed that a bistable i - v characteristic could result . by contrast our rate equation analysis always leads to single valued i - v curves .",
    "the bistability corresponds to a first - order `` energy landscape '' ; however the system under study is zero dimensional , and ( at least within the approach used here ) thermal and quantal fluctuations allow the system to explore all of phase space wiping out any phase transition behaviour .",
    "the calculation of gogolin and komnik are presented for a different regime ( @xmath375 ) , but we suspect that fluctuations would also eliminate the apparent transition in that case",
    ". an enhanced low frequency noise might however occur .",
    "four recent paper have appeared which present results consistent with those presented here , but emphasizing somewhat different aspects of the physics .",
    "mc carthy et al .",
    "@xcite used the rate equation approach of our section iii , our results reproduce theirs ; however the main interest if ref  @xcite was in the iv curves of phonons coupled to the dot - lead hybridization and the principal focus was on thermally equilibrated phonons .",
    "our result extend theirs by treating the nonequilibrium case ( see eg . fig .",
    "[ fig : pdist1 ] ) and the noise ( see eg . fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] ) .",
    "fedorets and coworkers @xcite have analyzed the same problem as mccarthy et al .",
    "but in the limit of very weak coupling of phonons to a heat bath .",
    "they find that an instability occurs for @xmath140 greater than a critical value .",
    "interestingly in the weak coupling limit the critical @xmath140 reported is identical to the critical @xmath140 found in our calculation above which the phonon distribution become broad ( see fig .  [ fig : pdist1 ] ) .",
    "according to the refs .",
    "@xcite the instability occurs if one has both lead coupled and dot coupled phonons , whereas the broad distribution is generic .",
    "however , this relation deserves further exploration . here",
    "we observe that the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite ( as well as those of our section iii ) are based on a sequential - tunneling approximation . in this approximation when the threshold is exceeded the distribution we find changes rapidly ( in the weak electron - phonon coupling limit ) from very narrow to very broad .",
    "however if cotunneling processes ( in particular the electron contribution to the phonon lifetime ) are included , the transition becomes broadened with the onset moving to a lower voltage ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nph ] ) .",
    "we find the breadth of the distribution to depend strongly on the bias asymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the average occupation of the dot .",
    "flensberg @xcite has used an approximate equation of motion approach to analyze the quantum limit , determining in particular the equilibrium dot spectral function and presenting a clear analysis of the terms omitted in previous approaches @xcite . where there is overlap our results are in agreement with his , however non - equilibrium conditions have not been considered in this reference @xcite .",
    "finally aji , moore and varma  @xcite have considered phonon effects on the cotunneling spectrum .",
    "their results are in essential agreement with ours , however we note that the steps in @xmath336 which they report to be vertical at @xmath358 are in fact smoothed by the phonon lifetime arising from electron - phonon coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cotun ] ) or to coupling to a heat bath .",
    "also we find that the steps are thermally broadened into indetectability at a relatively low t fixed by the step height and the phonon lifetime induced slope , rather than generically visible up to temperatures of order the phonon frequency , as stated in the reference @xcite .",
    "as far as experiments are concerned , three recent papers  @xcite have observed signatures in the current - voltage characteristics which are attributed to coupling to a molecular vibrational mode .",
    "a direct comparison to our results is not yet feasible because noise measurements have not been performed , and most of the samples studied show one or at most two phonon sidebands .",
    "( only one of the samples of ref .",
    "@xcite was reported to show more ) .",
    "finally we briefly mention a few issues raised by this work , but not resolved .",
    "one important research area is the extension of our quantum limit results beyond the perturbative regime ( in particular to the nonequilibrium polaron limit ) , a second is to obtain the frequency dependence of the noise spectra in the classical and quantal regimes , a third issue is the crossover between equilibrated and unequilibrated phonons , and a fourth issue is to explore the connection between the nonequilibrium distributions we find and the instabilities discussed by the chalmers group @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is to explore the effect of image charges induced in the surrounding electrodes on i - v  @xcite which have been argued to be important in certain experiments @xcite .",
    "work in these directions is in progress .",
