    "within the framework of the brane world models the size of extra spatial dimensions may be much larger than the plank s length , and the fundamental quantum gravity scale may be very low ( @xmath1 tev ) . when considering models with large extra dimensions the black hole mass may be of order tev .",
    ", i.e. much smaller than the plank s mass .",
    "there is a possibility of production of such mini black holes in particle collisions in colliders and in cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "estimations show that these higher dimensional black holes can be described by classical solutions of vacuum einstein equations .",
    "thus the investigation of general properties of these black holes , including perturbations and decay of different fields around them , attracts considerable interest now ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is well - known that when perturbing black hole it undergoes damping oscillations which are characterized by some complex eigenvalues of the wave equations called _",
    "quasinormal frequencies_. their real parts represent the oscillation frequencies , while the imaginary ones determine the damping rates of the modes .",
    "the quasinormal modes ( qn ) of black holes ( bh s ) depend only on a black hole parameters and not on a way in which they were excited .",
    "qn s are called , therefore ,  footprints \" of a black hole . being a useful characteristic of black hole s dynamics ,",
    "quasinormal modes are studied also within different contexts now : in anti - de - sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence ( see for example @xcite- @xcite and references therein ) , because of the possibility of observing quasinormal ringing of astrophysical bh s ( see @xcite for a review ) , when considering thermodynamic properties of black holes in loop quantum gravity @xcite-@xcite , in the context of possible connection with critical collapse @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus it would be interesting to know , from different grounds , what happen with qn spectrum a black hole living in @xmath0 -dimensional space - time @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the present paper is two - fold : first we extend the wkb method of schutz , will and iyer for computing qn modes from the 3th to the 6th order beyond the eikonal approximation ( see sec.ii and appendix i ) . in a lot of physical situations",
    "this allows us to compute the qnms accurately and quickly without resorting to complicated numerical methods . in appendix",
    "ii qn modes of @xmath4 schwarzshild black hole induced by perturbations of different spin are obtained by the 6th order wkb formula , and compared with the numerical values and 3th order wkb values .",
    "second , motivated by the above reasons , we apply the obtained wkb formula for finding of the scalar quasinormal modes of multi - dimensional schwarzshild black hole ( sec .",
    "it proves out that the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies are proportional to the product @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the horizon radius , and @xmath0 is the dimension of space - time .",
    "first semi - analytical method for calculations of bh qnms was apparently proposed by bahram mashhoon who used the poschl - teller potential to estimate the qn frequencies @xcite . in @xcite",
    "there was proposed a semi - analytical method for computing qnm s based on the wkb treatment .",
    "then in @xcite the first wkb order formula was extended to the third order beyond the eikonal approximation , and , afterwards , was frequently used in a lot of works ( see for example @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the accuracy of the 3th order wkb formula ( see eq . ( 1.5 ) in @xcite ) is the better , the more multipole number @xmath3 and the less overtone @xmath7 . for the schwarzshild bh",
    "the results practically coincide with accurate numerical results of leaver @xcite at @xmath8 when being restricted by lower overtones for which @xmath9 . for fewer multipoles , however , accuracy is worse , and may reaches @xmath10 per cents at @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "numerical approach @xcite , on contrary , is very accurate , but , dealing with numerical integration or systems of recurrence relations , is very cumbersome , and , often , require modification to be applied to different effective potentials . at the same time wkb approach lets us to obtain qnm s for a full range of parameters giving thereby some fields of work for intuition as to physical behavior of a system .",
    "even though wkb formula gives the best accuracy at @xmath9 , it includes the case of astrophysical black hole radiation where only lower overtones are significantly excited @xcite . both advantages and deficiencies of the wkb approach motivated us to extend the existent 3th order wkb formula up to the 6th order .",
    "the perturbation equations of a black hole can be reduced to the schrodinger wave - like equation : @xmath13 where `` the potential '' @xmath14 is constant at the event horizon ( @xmath15 ) and at the infinity ( @xmath16 ) and it rises to maximum at some intermediate @xmath17 .",
    "consider radiation of a given frequency @xmath18 incident on the black hole from infinity and let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the reflection and transmission amplitudes respectively .",
    "extend @xmath19 to the complex frequency plane such that @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is regular .",
    "then , the quasinormal modes correspond to the singularities of @xmath23 .",
    "we have a direct analogy with the problem of scattering near the pick of the potential barrier in quantum mechanics , where @xmath24 plays a role of energy , and the two turning points divide the space into three regions at which boundaries the corresponding solutions should be matched .",
    "to extend the 3th order wkb formula of @xcite we used the technique of iyer and will .",
    "we shall omit here the technicalities of this approach which are described in @xcite .",
    "the only thing we should stress is that since the coefficients @xmath25 , that connect amplitudes near the horizon with those at infinity , depend only on @xmath26 ( related to the overtone number @xmath7 ) they may be found to higher orders , simply by solving the interior ( between the turning points ) problem to higher orders . thus there is no need to perform an explicit match of the solutions to wkb solutions in the exterior ( outside turning points ) regions to the same order .",
    "the result has the form : @xmath27 where the correction terms @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be found in the appendix i. note that @xmath28 coincides with preliminary formula ( a3 ) of @xcite in proper designations .    an alternative , pure algebraic approach to finding higher order wkb corrections was proposed by o.zaslavskii @xcite , using a quantum anharmonic oscillator problem where wkb correction terms come from perturbation theory corrections to the potential anharmonicity .",
    "thus we have obtained an economic and accurate formula for straightforward calculation of qnm frequencies .",
    "the 6th order formula applied to the @xmath4 schwarzshild bh is as accurate already at @xmath31 as the 3th order formula does at @xmath32 .",
    "we show it in appendix ii on example of qnm s corresponding to perturbations of fields of different spins : scalar ( @xmath33 ) , neutrino ( @xmath34 ) , electromagnetic ( @xmath35 ) , gravitino ( @xmath36 ) , and gravitational ( @xmath37 ) . in addition , looking at the convergence of all sixth wkb values to some unknown true qn mode , we can judge , approximately , how far from the true qn value we are , staying within the framework of wkb method .",
    "the metric of the schwarzshild black hole in @xmath0-dimensions has the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 here we used the quantities @xmath40 .",
    "the scalar perturbation equation of this black hole can be reduced to the schrodinger wave - like equation ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath41 : @xmath42 where `` the potential '' @xmath14 has the form : @xmath43 at some fixed @xmath0 we can put @xmath44 and measure @xmath18 in units @xmath45 .",
    "the quasinormal modes satisfy the boundary conditions : @xmath46    the 6th wkb order formula used here gives very accurate results for low overtones .",
    "the previous orders serve us to see the convergence of the wkb values of @xmath24 as a wkb order grows to an accurate numerical result .",
    "namely we can observe that for @xmath47 for the fundamental overtone the 6th order values differs form its 5th order value by fractions of a percent or less at not very large @xmath0 ( we are restricted here by @xmath48 ) .",
    "it proves out that if one takes @xmath44 for each given @xmath0 , then the real parts of @xmath18 for different @xmath0 lay on a strict line .",
    "that is , @xmath49 is proportional to the product @xmath50 ( remember that @xmath6 depends on @xmath0 itself ) .",
    "namely , for the fundamental overtone we obtain the following approximate relations : @xmath51        here we take @xmath54 . generally , the more the multipole number @xmath3 , the more the coefficient before the product @xmath5 . the same @xmath55 relation we observed for higher overtone but not higher than @xmath3 , for which wkb treatment is applicable . in fig.1,2 we presented the real and imaginary parts of @xmath18 measured in @xmath45 for different @xmath0 . for real parts of @xmath31 modes we see the deviation from the strict line at large @xmath0 .",
    "this however , is stipulated by a bad accuracy of the wkb approach , and we believe that the true frequencies will lay on strict line again .",
    "indeed , one can judge about it by looking at the convergence plot fig.3-fig.6 where the real and imaginary parts of @xmath18 are shown as a function of the wkb order .",
    "generally the accuracy of the wkb formula is the better , the more @xmath3 , and the less @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "note that the dependence @xmath5 for lower overtones can be recovered even within 3th order formula , provided @xmath3 is greater than @xmath56 , and @xmath0 is not very large .",
    "( bottom ) and @xmath59 ( top ) as a function of wkb order of the formula with which it was obtained for @xmath31 , @xmath60 , @xmath4 modes , and the corresponding numerical value .",
    "we see how the wkb values converge to an accurate numerical value as the wkb order increases . ]",
    "another point is the @xmath11 modes : in this case the lowest overtone implies @xmath63 , and the wkb formula has considerable relative error .",
    "for a four - dimensional bh , for which the accurate numerical results are known , the error is about @xmath10 percent for @xmath59 , and @xmath64 percent for @xmath49 in the third wkb order , while in the sixth order it reduces to @xmath65 percent for @xmath49 and @xmath57 percent for @xmath59 ( see appendix ii ) . for greater @xmath0",
    "the error increases , the difference between the fifth and sixth order wkb values grows and one can not judge of true quasinormal behavior in this case ( see fig.3 , 4 , 5 . ) .",
    "fortunately , other field perturbations , including gravitational , have the lowest overtone with @xmath66 and the wkb treatment is of good accuracy for all @xmath3 . in table 1 .",
    "we compare the third order wkb values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 modes for different @xmath0 @xcite with those obtained through the sixth order here .        99 s.dimopoulos and s.landsberg , phys .",
