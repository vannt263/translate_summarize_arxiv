    "driven by the heavy - ion programs at gsi , cern sps , rhic and lhc there is strong interest in the properties of strongly interacting matter at extreme temperatures and baryon densities .",
    "the access to the phase diagram of qcd is hampered by the fact that lattice simulations at finite density suffer from the sign problem @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years impressive progress has been made in the understanding of the phase diagram of qcd within qcd effective models such as the polyakov - loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) , see e.g.  @xcite , and the polyakov - loop extended quark - meson ( pqm ) model , see @xcite . in these models",
    "the information about the confining glue sector of the theory is incorporated in form of a polyakov - loop potential that is extracted from pure yang - mills lattice simulations .",
    "the matter sector of these models has been studied in detail also beyond the mean - field level by taking into account the quark - meson quantum fluctuations mostly within a functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach , for recent studies see @xcite .",
    "however , the most difficult problem within these models is the question of how to embed the quantum back - reaction of the matter sector to the gluonic sector .",
    "this problem has effectively been resolved in @xcite where the change of @xmath0 , and hence the confinement - deconfinement transition temperature @xmath1 , in the presence of dynamical quarks has been computed within hard thermal and/or hard dense loop ( htl / hdl ) perturbation theory .",
    "this leads to a flavor and chemical potential dependence of the transition temperature @xmath1 , and is a qualitatively viable procedure : the change of the non - perturbative scale @xmath2 can be very well estimated within perturbation theory as has been shown and confirmed in many computations at zero - temperature and finite - temperature qcd .",
    "moreover , this perturbative estimate in @xcite has been confirmed by first principle qcd computations with the functional renormalization group at real and imaginary chemical potential in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "very recently the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath1 has been estimated by constraining pnjl results with those in the statistical model @xcite .",
    "this links the model parameter @xmath4 under certain weak assumptions to experimental data about the chemical freeze - out curve and nicely confirms the theoretical prediction in @xcite .",
    "this shows that even though being qcd effective models , they provide valuable information about the phase diagram , and in particular help to exclude certain scenarios .",
    "moreover , the models can be understood as specific controlled approximations to full dynamical qcd .",
    "most directly this is realized within the above - mentioned frg approach put forward in @xcite .",
    "this link enables us to systematically extend the pnjl / pqm models towards full dynamical qcd .    in the present work we take an important step towards full dynamical qcd and",
    "present the first computation with fully dynamical matter sector in the pqm model at finite density .",
    "an interesting first frg computation at vanishing density has been put forward in @xcite . there , however , the back - coupling to the glue sector has been neglected . here",
    ", we include the back - reaction of the matter sector as described above .",
    "the uncertainty can be estimated by comparing it to the qcd computation in @xcite . within the present pqm approach beyond mean field",
    "we provide results on the phase boundaries for the confinement - deconfinement and the chiral transitions as well as on thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure , quark number density and quark number susceptibility .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we discuss the back - reaction of the matter fluctuations to the qcd yang - mills sector in more detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pqm ] , the polyakov - loop and its potential is introduced and coupled to the quark - meson model which then defines the polyakov  quark - meson model . at first , the grand potential of this model is evaluated in mean - field approximation .",
    "afterwards , the flow equation for the grand potential of this model is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : flow ] where also the choice of model parameters is discussed . sec .",
    "[ sec : phase_structure ] is devoted to the phase structure and some thermodynamical applications , in particular we evaluate the pressure , quark number density and quark number susceptibility .",
    "the phase structure , i.e. , the chiral and confinement - deconfinement phase transition is explored in detail .",
    "subsequently , the influence of the polyakov loop on the thermodynamics is investigated and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] concluding remarks are drawn .",
    "the polyakov  quark - meson ( pqm ) model was studied in a mean - field approximation for the matter sector in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the coupling between the pure glue sector , realized by an effective polyakov - loop potential @xmath5 , and the quark - meson matter sector is provided by the fermionic determinant .",
    "however , in @xcite an important step beyond the mean - field approximation was already introduced .",
    "more specifically , the pure glue potential @xmath5 was adjusted on the basis of phenomenological arguments : the phase transition temperature @xmath1 in the potential @xmath5 relates to the dynamical scale in qcd , @xmath2 . if the dynamics of the quarks is switched on , this scale is lowered .",
    "in @xcite we have provided a flavor and quark chemical potential dependent transition temperature @xmath4 which was estimated from hard thermal and hard dense loop considerations . here",
    ", we shall elaborate this argument in more detail , also in order to show that no double counting is involved in the computation and to tighten the link to first principle qcd .",
    "we also stress that the above phenomenological argument works well at large chemical potential @xmath3 as well as at small chemical potential . for vanishing chemical potential",
    "we also compare our results with a recent dynamical qcd calculation @xcite .",
    "this allows us to qualitatively adjust the phase transition lines at small chemical potential and small temperature , and gives us access to information about a possible critical endpoint as well as the size of a possible quarkyonic matter region at large chemical potential in the qcd phase diagram as suggested in @xcite .",
    "what is then left is to include the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the matter sector in the presence of the non - trivial polyakov loop .",
    "this is achieved with functional renormalization group ( frg ) methods and is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : flow ] , for reviews see e.g. @xcite . in combination , this allows for a polyakov - loop effective model computation which already takes into account the full dynamics of qcd phenomenologically .",
    "we proceed with the explanation of the @xmath6 and @xmath3 dependence of the transition temperature @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "a full two - flavor qcd computation was put forward for vanishing and imaginary chemical potential . the related functional rg equation for the effective action",
    "is provided in a simple diagrammatic form in fig .",
    "[ fig : funflow ] .    the first two loops in fig .",
    "[ fig : funflow ] stand for quantum fluctuations ( gluons and ghosts ) in the pure glue sector that , e.g. , generate the polyakov - loop potential .",
    "the third loop represents the quark fluctuations , and the last term encodes mesonic fluctuations generated by dynamical hadronization @xcite .",
    "the crosses denote the cut - off insertion which restricts the loop momenta to that about the cut - off scale , and @xmath7 stands for all fields . for more details see @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the above equation for the effective action is fully coupled .",
    "an important example is the gluonic ( and indirectly the ghost ) propagation that is modified in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "this aspect is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkloop ] where the quark contribution to the gluonic propagator flow is shown . in turn , there are gluonic contributions to quark and meson correlation functions , and the system is highly non - linear .",
    "another important aspect is that the pure yang - mills ( ym ) polyakov - loop potential can be derived from the pure yang - mills flow as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : funflowym ] .",
    "this simply amounts to dropping the matter loops in fig .",

    "the pure yang - mills computation has been done in @xcite , and the related @xmath1 agrees quantitatively with lattice predictions which are used to adjust the @xmath1 parameter in the polyakov - loop potential @xmath5 .",
    "these findings also elucidate that @xmath1 is nothing else but the dynamical ym - scale @xmath8 inherent in the ghost and gluon propagators .",
    "this supports the quantitative accuracy of such an approach .    in turn , the quantum dynamics of the quark - meson model",
    "is obtained by dropping the yang - mills diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : funflow ] , that is the gluon and ghost loop .",
    "this has been studied extensively in the literature , for recent works see e.g.  @xcite . in summary , it is this simple additive structure for the different contributions that allows to systematically improve quark - meson models towards full qcd within an frg approach .",
    "moreover , it also allows us to directly use full qcd information within the pqm / pnjl models .",
    "this reduces the parameter - dependence of these models , and qualitatively enhances the predictive power .    an important example for",
    "this structure is the polyakov - loop potential in these models : the polyakov - loop potential @xmath5 in full dynamical qcd still comes from the yang - mills contributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : funflow ] . the related polyakov - loop potential in qcd can be computed from the full dynamical qcd computation in @xcite , and receives a flavor and chemical potential dependence via fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkloop ] .",
    "it is clear that the quark contributions to the gluon propagation ( and ghost propagation ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkloop ] lower the dynamical scale in the gluon and ghost propagation , and hence @xmath1 . in turn , with constant @xmath1 without a flavor and @xmath3-dependence , this contribution is estimated by the pure yang - mills results .",
    "we conclude that the hard thermal and hard dense loop adjustment of @xmath1 is necessary for the full inclusion of quark effects to the polyakov - loop potential .",
    "in particular , the above contributions are not included in the fermionic determinant and thus no double counting is involved .    in summary ,",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath6 and @xmath3-dependence in @xmath1 as well as the dynamics of the quark - meson sector of the model in the presence of a non - trivial polyakov - loop expectation value gives us a good qualitative control about the full qcd dynamics , and the link is tightened by comparing @xmath4 with qcd results in @xcite .",
    "the direct use of the full qcd polyakov - loop potential will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the polyakov - quark - meson model as put forward in @xcite already provides a good approximation of full qcd at low energies and temperatures and not too high densities .",

    "their functional form is motivated by the underlying qcd symmetries in the pure gauge limit and they all reproduce a first - order transition at @xmath27 mev for @xmath11 colors in this limit .    in this work we use a polynomial ansatz for the polyakov - loop potential @xmath28 with the temperature - dependent coefficient @xmath29    the parameters of eqs .",

    "furthermore , we can unambiguously distinguish the peak positions of the chiral and deconfinement transition in the temperature derivatives .",
    "even when we vary the parameter @xmath64 almost no differences emerge . only for value of @xmath64 close to one an ambiguity in the peak positions of the temperature derivatives",
    "arises , similar to the constant @xmath1-case discussed below .",
    "we see that the deconfinement transition line stays close to the chiral phase boundary .",
    "it has been speculated that the quarkyonic phase @xcite is signaled by a region with confinement and chiral symmetry .",
    "mean field computations in the pnjl and pqm model with constant @xmath1 have supported this scenario . as has been shown in @xcite , this",
    "does not hold true if the dynamics of the transition parameter @xmath1 is taken into account . here",
    "we have confirmed that in the fully dynamical pqm model the prediction in @xcite holds .    the chiral first - order transition line arising at small temperatures and large chemical potentials terminates in a cep which is located at @xmath139 mev , @xmath140 mev .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the precise location of the cep depends on the chosen parameters in the vacuum , in particular on the sigma meson mass .",
    "the back - bending of the first - order transition line in the phase diagram towards smaller chemical potential is typical for a frg calculation @xcite .",
    "but very close to the @xmath3-axis the slope of the first - order line tends back to infinity similar to a mean - field treatment ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "this behavior is also in agreement with the clausius - clapeyron relation according to which the transition line should hit the @xmath3-axis perpendicular .    if we switch off the back - reaction of the matter fluctuations to the yang - mills sector and choose a constant @xmath130 mev , the above picture changes drastically . for finite chemical potential the polyakov loops @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath93 start to deviate and the widths of their temperature derivatives increase over the whole phase diagram .",
    "the resulting phase diagram for a constant @xmath1 is summarized in the left panel of . in the vicinity of the intersection point of the chiral transition and the deconfinement transition which are both smooth crossovers around @xmath141 mev",
    "a double peak structure in the corresponding temperature derivatives of the polyakov - loop variables occur .",
    "this hampers a unique identification of the transition point . in order to clarify this behavior",
    "we plot the maximum of the peak location of the @xmath114-derivatives in the phase diagram together with a band around @xmath138 of the maximum value . for larger chemical potential",
    "the peak locations deviate strongly and a coincidence of the chiral and deconfinement transitions can be excluded .",
    "this brings back the chirally symmetric and confined region which has been connected to the quarkyonic phase . in summary , we have shown that this signature is very sensitive to the correct implementation of the back - reaction of the matter sector to the glue sector , and is most likely not present .    at high chemical potential and small temperatures",
    ", a first - order chiral phase transition takes place which ends in a critical endpoint of second order located at @xmath142 mev , @xmath143 mev .",
    "in general , the initial action given at the ultraviolet cutoff is independent of the temperature and chemical potential which limits the reliable calculation of thermodynamic quantities to a certain temperature and density region . due to the ultraviolet cutoff high thermal and quantum fluctuations",
    "are suppressed . as a consequence",
    ", cutoff - independent predictions can be obtained for temperatures @xmath144 which in our case yields an upper temperature bound of @xmath145 mev . in order to cure this cutoff remnant at high temperature one",
    "has to combine the frg with the expected perturbative results .",
    "the inclusion of the missing high - momentum modes can be achieved in an effective way by adding to the original flow , , a flow equation for an interacting polyakov - loop quark system for scales @xmath146 .",
    "note , that an explicit gluon contribution to the flow equation is neglected here because the effective polyakov - loop potential is fitted to reproduce the stefan boltzmann ( sb ) limit at high temperatures . in this way",
    "we employ the equation @xmath147\\ , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath148 as previously defined .",
    "this equation is integrated from @xmath149 to @xmath150 and yields the uv - contribution @xmath151 , which is then added to the grand potential resulting from the solution of the rg flow equation ( [ eq : flow ] ) .",
    "the divergent zero mode contribution in is neglected here . however , for vanishing quark masses this term represents an unobservable shift in the grand potential .    in the thermodynamic pressure normalized to the stefan - boltzmann pressure for three different quark chemical potentials",
    "is shown as a function of temperature . in the left panel of this figure ,",
    "a fixed @xmath152 mev has been used while in the right panel the @xmath3-corrections are taken into account .",
    "the inset displays the pressure for @xmath153 mev which is close to the critical endpoint in the phase diagram . for small temperatures the pressure decreases and has a kink at the critical temperature due to the first - order transition . without the back - reaction of the matter fluctuations to the yang - mills sector a similar behavior in all three curves",
    "is observed . in the vicinity of the chiral transition the pressure increases due to the melting of the quark masses and saturates at about @xmath138 of the corresponding ideal gas limit which reads for @xmath6 massless quarks and @xmath154 massless gluons @xmath155 + ( n_c^2 - 1 )    \\frac{\\pi^2 } { 45 } \\ .\\ ] ] including the back - reaction of the matter sector via the inclusion of @xmath156 changes the thermodynamics at larger chemical potential .",
    "the pressure increases much faster and saturates at @xmath153 mev at @xmath157 of the stefan - boltzmann limit .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the entropy , , and quark number density , , if the @xmath3-corrections are taken into account .",
    "the entropy density decreases for small temperatures at @xmath153 mev since the number of active degrees of freedom decreases when approaching the first - order transition from below .",
    "at the transition the entropy jumps .",
    "the bump around @xmath158 mev ( left panel ) is a remnant from the smooth chiral crossover transition .",
    "this effect is completely washed out when the @xmath3-corrections are included ( right panel ) .",
    "similar to the findings for the pressure these corrections become more significant at larger chemical potential .",
    "this also appears in the quark number density @xmath159 which is plotted in . for comparison the corresponding sb - limits ( dashed lines )",
    "are also shown in this figure .",
    "the quark density approaches the sb - limit always from below . without the @xmath3-corrections the polyakov loop suppresses the quark densities for chemical potential larger than the intersection point of the chiral and deconfinement transition in the phase diagram . with the @xmath61 corrections both transitions coincide over the whole phase diagram and as a consequence the quark number density approaches much faster the sb - limit ( right panel of ) .    in the scaled quark number density ( left panel ) and the corresponding scaled quark number susceptibility ( right panel ) for three different temperature slices around the critical endpoint ( @xmath160 mev ) as a function of the quark chemical potential",
    "are collected . in this figure the @xmath3-corrections in @xmath56 are omitted while in they are taken into account .",
    "due to the chiral critical endpoint which is a second - order transition the susceptibility diverges with a certain power law @xcite .",
    "there are no strong modifications in the structure of the susceptibility divergence if the back - reaction of the matter sector is taken into account or not . as a consequence",
    "it seems that the size of the critical region around the cep is not strongly modified by these fluctuations .",
    "the only difference is that including the @xmath3-corrections the peak height of the susceptibility is more pronounced towards the cep .",
    "in the present work we have studied the polyakov - extended quark - meson model beyond mean - field approximation . the quark - meson fluctuations to the matter sector are included within a functional renormalization group approach . in turn , the quark - meson fluctuations to the gluonic sector are estimated by a perturbative computation as suggested in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the latter procedure has been recently confirmed by a full dynamical qcd computation @xcite .",
    "the validity range of the present model includes the temperature regime about the crossover temperature @xmath161 mev up to medium quark chemical potential of @xmath162 mev . at low temperature and large chemical potential",
    "the model suffers from missing inclusion of baryonic degrees of freedom and further resonances .    however , the quantum fluctuations lead to strong modifications of the phase structure .",
    "such modifications have already been observed in frg studies of the quark - meson model .",
    "one of the prominent effects is a shrinking of the size of the critical region around the critical endpoint in the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum fluctuations push the potential critical endpoint towards lower temperatures and larger chemical potential , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "our computation entails a small likelihood for a critical point with @xmath163 as predicted by some recent lattice studies @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is in accordance with the arguments of @xcite as well as with recent developments concerning the convergence of the taylor expansion about vanishing chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the latter also complicates the extraction of the location of the critical point from the analysis of higher moments such as investigated in @xcite .",
    "thus , an extension of the present computations beyond mean field towards the low temperature high density regime will provide valuable information .",
    "further results concern thermodynamical quantities such as the pressure and the density . at vanishing density",
    "these quantities agree well with related lattice predictions and , in particular , show the correct behavior in the transition regime from mesonic degrees of freedom to the quark - gluon plasma regime .    in a forthcoming publication @xcite we will present a full solution including novel algorithmic differentiation techniques @xcite for the flow which also allows us to discuss the systematics of the present approach towards qcd , as well as studying further thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we also plan to extend the present study to the @xmath52 flavor case , as well as tightening the relation to full dynamical qcd .",
