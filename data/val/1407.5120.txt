    "the morphology and colours of galaxies carry important information about their formation and evolution .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 109 large , nearby early - type galaxies to examine their isophotal shapes , using fourier expansions in the polar angle to distinguish between boxy ( rectangular ) isophotes and disky ( pointed ) isophotes .",
    "studies have shown that elliptical galaxies with disky isophotes tend to be fainter , rotationally supported , lack x - ray and radio activity and have power - law nuclear light profiles , while those with boxy isophotes tend to be brighter , supported by random motions , have significant x - ray and radio activity and peaked nuclear profile @xcite .",
    "the shapes of galaxies may also be correlated with their ages @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite studied the isophotal shapes of a large sample of 847 early - type galaxies from the sdss , and @xcite have used the same sample to investigate the dependence of the isophotal structure on the agn activity and environment of the galaxies . the dynamic range available to these studies",
    "is limited , due to the short exposure of the sdss .",
    "the isophotal shape study by @xcite extends to 1.5 times effective radius ( 1.5@xmath2 ) of the galaxies , while @xcite studied their larger sample of 857 nearby galaxies with redshift @xmath3 extending to 1.5 times the petrosian half - light radius ( 1.5@xmath4 ) .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the properties of isophotal shapes for a sample of more distant early - type galaxies in a single field , using exceptionally deep ccd exposures .",
    "these enable us to go out to much larger radii of @xmath5 and reach @xmath6 deeper in surface brightness .",
    "we have obtained redshifts for a subsample of these galaxies : the redshifts peak at @xmath7 and extend to @xmath8 , covering a wide range of absolute magnitudes .",
    "studies of the faint outer parts of galaxies are not new . by 1980",
    "malin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was using sky survey photographs to create images that reached 10 magnitudes below the level of the sky background .",
    "these led to the discovery of very faint shells and tails around galaxies , soon interpreted as evidence for dynamical evolution due to gravitational interactions and mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite combined photographic and ccd imaging of nine nearby galaxies , to explore the boundary between e and s0 galaxies by looking at the changing shapes of isophotes with radius .",
    "we extend the methodology of @xcite and derive mean isophote parameters for up to four radial bins for each galaxy .",
    "pointed isophotes can usually be attributed to a galaxy which consists of a spheroid and a weak disk which is being viewed more or less edge - on .",
    "@xcite suggest that some pointed isophotes may be due to tidal extensions .",
    "but the origin of boxy isophotes is still unclear .",
    "@xcite showed that mergers of spiral galaxies with comparable mass are more likely to form boxy ellipticals , while mergers of spiral galaxies with differing mass can lead to disky ellipticals .",
    "however , disc - disc mergers do not form a perfect dichotomy @xcite , while elliptical - elliptical mergers always lead to boxy isophotes @xcite .",
    "using n - body simulation @xcite found that for a 7:1 merger , isophotes in the inner region ( bulge ) are boxy , while the outer isophotes are disky .",
    "such radial variation is also seen in the analysis of 2mass data for arp mergers by @xcite .",
    "our study of isophotal shapes to faint levels will be useful for better comparison between observations and such theoretical possibilities .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the imaging data , sample selection , bulge - disk decomposition and spectroscopic data used for this study . in section  [ sec : parameter estimation ] , surface photometry of sample galaxies , and estimation of isophotal and rest frame parameters , are described . in section",
    "[ sec : observed properties ] , we give the properties of the sample and main results of our study along with the comparison with earlier work .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] and give a summary and our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "[ sec : data ]      [ subsecn : imaging ]    the imaging data were originally obtained as part of a faint quasar survey using the large format camera ( lfc ) on the @xmath1 hale telescope at mount palomar observatory , with integrated exposures ranging from 1 to 4 hours in _",
    ", _ i _ and _ z _ filters .",
    "the lfc is a mosaic of six @xmath9 pixel ccds , mounted at the prime focus of the hale telescope .",
    "the fields targeted were those of known sdss high redshift ( @xmath10 ) quasars in order to look for a local over - density of quasars @xcite .",
    "we obtained reduced images which were bias subtracted , flat fielded and processed to remove cosmic rays as a part of the original programme .",
    "the deep lfc images have excellent signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , permitting us to examine faint features , including the outermost extensions of the galaxies , down to @xmath0 of the sky brightness .    in this paper",
    "we use a sample of galaxies selected from the lfc field sdss 1208 + 0010 which spans an area of @xmath11 centered on @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the field was observed in the sdss _",
    "i _ and _ z _ filters with integrated exposure of @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the _ i_-band image of the field is an average combination of 140 individual frames .",
    "the mean background count in the _",
    "i_-band image is 6278 adu ( analog - to - digital units ) , so with a gain of 1.1 , an accuracy of @xmath0 is obtained in the estimation of the sky background .",
    "all the lfc fields are in the area of the sky covered by sdss imaging .",
    "we therefore have imaging data in the sdss _ u , g _ and _ r _ bands for our sample galaxies , in addition to the lfc _",
    "i _ and _ z _ band data , though not to the same depth . we have used the sdss dr7 photometric catalog @xcite to obtain the petrosian half - light radii , apparent magnitudes and galactic extinction corrections at the position of each sample galaxy in all the five bands .      [ subsecn : sample ]    we used sextractor @xcite to produce a catalog of all sources in the lfc field sdss 1208 + 0010 , and to identify galaxies from the catalog .",
    "sextractor provides a _",
    "stellarity index _ for star / galaxy separation of the detected objects : 0 for an object identified as a galaxy , 1 for a star , and some intermediate value for ambiguous objects , which are usually the fainter objects in the sample .",
    "for correct star / galaxy separation , and to have galaxies with sufficient brightness and size to ensure reliable morphological study , we select galaxies using objects from our sextractor catalog which satisfy the following criteria : ( i ) sextractor parameter value @xmath16 ; ( ii ) sdss parameter value @xmath17 in the photoobjall table of the sdss dr7 photometric catalog @xcite ; and ( iii ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _ i_-band model magnitude of the object corrected for extinction , which is denoted by _ dered_i _ in the sdss dr7 photometric catalog . to ensure that a sufficient number of pixels is available for surface photometry , we included in our sample only objects with the _ i_-band sextractor parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the area covered by the chosen pixels is @xmath21 for every object in the sample , with the intensity in every pixel being brighter than the analysis threshold of @xmath22 , which corresponds to a @xmath23 detection threshold . through visual examination of the image ,",
    "we have excluded objects which are near bright stars . applying these criteria , we arrived at a sample of 266 galaxies .",
    "basic data for the target galaxies in field sdss 1208 + 0010 are available in table  [ tab : basic full ] , which is at the end of this article .",
    "we give first few entries from table  [ tab : basic full ] in table  [ tab : basic ] as an illustration .",
    "the table gives an lfc serial number for each galaxy , from the sextractor catalog generated by us , the sdss i d , position and photometric data from from the dr7 photometric catalog @xcite , and finally the semi - major axis ( in arcsec ) , _ i_-band surface brightness ( in @xmath24 ) and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the outermost isophote to which an ellipse can be fitted ( see section  [ sec : parameter estimation ] ) .    ) .",

    "these points are shown as arrows along the two profiles , with the surface brightness level reached at that point given as a fraction of the sky brightness . since the snr is the same for isophotes of the two images at the indicated points , it is clear that we reach @xmath6 fainter in surface brightness in the lfc images compared to the sdss images ( see section  [ sec : calculation ] ) .",

    "[ sec : parameter estimation ]    the early - type galaxies selected for our study are bulge dominated and therefore have isophotes which are close to elliptical in shape .",
    "it is our aim to measure morphological parameters which describe the elliptical shape , as well as small deviations from it , as a function of galaxy properties .",
    "we performed ellipse fitting using the iraf routine ` ellipse ` within stsdas , which is based on a technique described by @xcite . however , before the ellipse fitting , pre - processing using sextractor has to be performed to obtain a catalog of all detected objects in the field , a sky background image , and a _ segmentation _ image .",
    "the segmentation image is a map of all detected objects in the field in which , for any given object , all the pixels have value equal to the running sextractor catalog number corresponding to that object .",
    "the value of parameters used for estimation of background in the sextractor configuration file are back_size 128 ; back_filtersize 3 ; backphoto_type local ; and backphoto_thick 64 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sky background image obtained is subtracted from the field image , and @xmath87 pixel cutouts around the geometric center of our sample galaxies are made from the sky - subtracted image and the segmentation image .",
    "the cut - outs of segmentation images are used to generate mask files for the surface photometry .",
    "we use the geometric center , ellipticity and position angle of sample galaxies , obtained from the sextractor catalog , as initial values in the ellipse fitting . in the ` ellipse ` task , the image intensity is first sampled along a trial ellipse generated using these parameters , and the intensity string @xmath88 is expanded in a fourier series , @xmath89 } ,   { \\label{eq : ellipse}}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the highest harmonic fitted and @xmath91 is the azimuthal angle measured from the major axis . `",
    "ellipse ` uses the first and second order coefficients obtained for trial ellipses to iteratively improve the fitting . for perfectly elliptical isophotes",
    "all the fourier coefficients except @xmath92 , which is the mean isophotal intensity , should vanish at the end of the fitting process , and significant residuals can only be of order three or higher .",
    "we allowed the geometric center , ellipticity and position angle to vary freely during fitting .",
    "successive ellipses are fitted along the semi - major axis with a logarithmic step of 0.05 until the ratio ( mean isophotal intensity / total error in isophotal intensity ) @xmath93 , or the ellipse fitting process fails to converge .",
    "the output of ` ellipse ` is a table containing radial profiles of number of isophotal parameters along with uncertainties associated with them ( see * ? ? ? * for error estimation of isophotal parameters ) .    in their seminal papers on the isophotal shapes of elliptical galaxies , @xcite and @xcite",
    "define structural parameter @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 provided by the ` ellipse ` table are normalized to the semi - major axis @xmath98 and the local intensity gradient intensity @xmath99 ( ` ellipse ` output grad ) .",
    "the normalized @xmath97 coefficients can be converted to the @xmath94 parameter as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the semi - minor axis and @xmath102 is isophotal ellipticity @xcite .",
    "the factor of @xmath103 is needed to re - normalize the radial deviation to the equivalent radius @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath105 parameter , which is the most dominant coefficient for any isophote deviating from a pure ellipse , quantifies the deviation along the major axis of the isophote .",
    "isophotes with @xmath106 have a `` boxy '' shape while the shape of isophotes with @xmath107 is `` disky '' @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath95 can be related to the normalized @xmath96 parameter through a relation similar to equation  [ eq : b4 to a4 ] but we do not use it in our present work .    the fourier coefficients and morphological parameters vary along the semi - major axis , and we find that there are significant changes in values in the outer regions of the galaxies .",
    "it is therefore not enough to consider characteristic values of the parameters at a single fiducial distance from the centre , as has been done by earlier workers ( see e.g.@xcite , @xcite ) , for investigating relationships between these parameters and other global galaxy properties .",
    "however , in comparing data for a large sample of galaxies it is convenient to derive mean values of isophote parameters in a few regions , rather than the full sets of isophotes .",
    "we therefore divide each galaxy into four regions defined by distance from the centre along the semi - major axis : ( i ) seeing radius @xmath108 to @xmath109 ( region 1 ) , ( ii ) @xmath109 to @xmath110 ( region 2 ) , ( iii ) @xmath110 to @xmath111 ( region 3 ) and ( iv ) semi - major axis @xmath112 ( region 4 ) , where @xmath4 is the petrosian half - light radius . in each region",
    "we obtain the mean value of various parameters , weighted with the intensity ( counts ) and inversely weighted with the variance of the parameter .",
    "for example , the mean value of @xmath105 in region 1 is obtained as @xmath113}^{-2 } dr } { \\displaystyle\\int_{r_{s}}^{1.5r_{50 } } i(r ) { \\left[}\\sigma_{\\frac{a_{4}}{a}}(r )   { \\right]}^{-2 } dr     } { \\label{eq : average a4}}\\ ] ] note that not all galaxies have data in all four regions : for example , region 1 does not exist if seeing radius @xmath114 , while sometimes it is impossible to fit reliable ellipses in regions 3 and 4 due to crowding and/or low @xmath115 .",
    "some of the derived parameters for our sample of galaxies are listed in table  [ tab : derived ] ( only the first 5 galaxies are listed here as examples ; the complete table is at the end of the article as table  [ tab : derived full ] ) .",

    "similarly , @xcite have reported that isophotal shape can not discriminate between the possible origin of the early - type galaxies , at least in the range @xmath167 because of the dependence of the shape upon the viewing angle as seen using simulations .",
    "we do not understand the dependence of @xmath105 parameter on viewing angle found by above authors which is inconsistent with the observations . in future ,",
    "the understanding of true intrinsic shapes of early - type galaxies may elucidate the effect of projection on the value of @xmath105 parameter .",
    "n - body merger simulations have been widely used by various researchers to study the origin of boxy and disky ellipticals .",

    "have shown in their fig .",

    "such radial variation has also been reported using the analysis of 2mass data for the arp mergers ( see * ? ? ? * appendix ) .",
    "similar merger scenarios can be considered as possible origin of the inner boxy and outer disky isophotes observed in some of our sample galaxies .",
    "@xcite have shown that for a merger with 7:1 mass ratio , outer diskiness is observed for a @xmath168 isophote around @xmath169 from the centre ( see their fig . 2 & 3 ) .",
    "in the region @xmath170 , the surface density falls by a factor of @xmath171 and for a constant mass - to - light ratio this corresponds to a @xmath172 magnitude difference .",
    "the outer region of @xcite corresponds to the region 4 of most of our sample galaxies , thus a disk is clearly indicated at such large radii .",

    "3 ) , while observations show larger diskiness in early - type galaxies . for example , observed values @xmath174 are obtained for the galaxies studied by @xcite , while some of our sample galaxies show larger diskiness ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "such galaxies are also a part of sample studied by the ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . the origin of strong diskiness therefore should have a different merger scenario from that studied by @xcite .",
    "the galaxies with larger diskiness could well be explained by hybrid mergers , in mass ratio 4:1 - 10:1 @xcite .",
    "they report @xmath176 for mergers with mass ratio 4.5:1 and @xmath177 for mergers with mass ratio 7:1 .    in binary merger scenarios , disky ellipticals",
    "are produced by 3:1 - 4:1 mergers while boxy ellipticals are product of equal - mass 1:1 mergers @xcite .",
    "but equal - mass binary mergers fail to reproduce the most boxy elliptical galaxies , particularly giant ellipticals @xcite . alternatively",
    ", multiple minor mergers can reproduce boxy ellipticals , where the product of mergers mainly depends on the total merged mass . when total merged mass increases ( @xmath178 ) , on average the remnants tend to show boxy isophotes ( see * ? ?",
    "the merged mass has been defined in a particular way by authors in their paper : for instance , when the initial galaxy has merged with 3 companions , each of them having a 5:1 mass ratio , this so - called merged mass is 1.6 ( 1.0 for the main initial galaxy and 0.2 for each companion ) .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] in this paper , we have studied the properties of the isophotal shapes of early - type galaxies ( e / so ) to very faint outer regions , well beyond the levels reached by previous studies of this type .",
    "our study is based on deep 5-color hale telescope lfc ccd images of several fields , originally taken for a different project , that enable us to reach surface brightnesses some @xmath181 fainter than most similar studies . here",
    "we present the first results for one @xmath182 field .",
    "we selected target galaxies using the deep lfc _",
    "i_-band image of the field and used much shallower sdss imaging data to get basic parameters such as apparent magnitudes and petrosian radii for each galaxy .",
    "266 sufficiently large and bright galaxies were selected for further study , 132 of which were identified as being of early - type on the basis of their bulge - to - total light ratios .",
    "we obtained spectra for over half of this sample using the multi - fibre system aaomega on the aat .",
    "these yielded reliable redshifts for 53 of the early - type galaxies , enabling us to derive their absolute magnitudes and physical sizes .",
    "we fitted a sequence of ellipses to successive isophotes in the deep lfc images and derived a range of isophotal shape parameters that measure their ellipticity and orientation , and also higher order departures from a purely elliptical shape .",
    "we then derive mean values for these parameters in four radial bins along the semi major axis of each galaxy .",
    "we find empirical fitting formulae for the probability distribution of the different isophotal parameters in each bin , which will be useful for comparison with theoretical studies , e.g. from n - body simulations .",
    "finally , we have investigated possible correlations of isophotal shape parameters with other global properties of the galaxies , and inspected whether the correlations change along the radius .",
    "we find that the isophotal shapes of the inner regions of our sample of galaxies are statistically different from the isophotal shapes observed in the outer regions .",
    "in the central regions we see patterns similar to those seen in previous studies of nearby galaxies , with some galaxies showing boxy isophotes while others appear disky. however , the pattern seen in the inner region of each galaxy tends to change as the radius increases , suggesting that while the inner parts of the galaxies are coherent and presumably the result of specific dynamical processes , at larger radii the shapes and orientations of the isophotes change and the behavior is not well - defined .",
    "this may indicate effects from the formation and evolution of each galaxy which are not yet fully relaxed .",
    "however , for a full analysis of these data we need to know the distances to the galaxies so that we can derive their luminosities , actual sizes and other physical parameters .",
    "we hope to obtain fibre spectra for many more galaxies to do this , preferably with one of the new integral field unit ( ifu ) systems that would avoid the effects of aperture bias that arise in single fibre spectra , and enable us to compare galaxies at very different redshifts . \"",
