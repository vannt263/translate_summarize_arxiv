    "according to the _ cosmological principle _ , our expanding universe , although it is so complex , can be considered at very large scale homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this is why we can model the universe , at very large scale , by the solution proposed by a. friedmann @xcite .",
    "this exact solution to einstein s equation , describing a homogeneous , isotropic universe , is in general called the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , due to the rediscovery and contributions made by georges lematre @xcite , h. p. robertson @xcite and a. g. walker @xcite .",
    "the flrw model shows that the universe should be , at a given moment of time , either in expansion , or in contraction . from hubble s observations ,",
    "we know that the universe is currently expanding .",
    "the flrw model shows that , long time ago , there was a very high concentration of matter , which exploded in what we call the _",
    "big bang_. was the density of matter at the beginning of the universe so high that the einstein s equation was singular at that moment ?",
    "this question received an affirmative answer , under general hypotheses and considering general relativity to be true , in hawking s singularity theorem @xcite ( which is an application of the reasoning of penrose for the black hole singularities @xcite , backwards in time to the past singularity of the big bang ) .    of course , given that the extreme conditions which were present at the big bang are very far from what our observations encountered so far , and our theories managed to extrapolate , we can not know precisely what happened then .",
    "if because some known or unknown quantum effect the energy condition from the hypothesis of the singularity theorem was not obeyed , the singularity might have been avoided , although it was a very high density .",
    "one such possibility is explored in the _ loop quantum cosmology _",
    "@xcite , which leads to a big bounce discrete model of the universe",
    ".    we will not explore here the possibility that the big bang singularity is prevented to exist by quantum or other kind of effects , because we do nt have the complete theory which is supposed to unify general relativity and quantum theory .",
    "what we will do in the following is to push the limits of general relativity to see what happens at the big bang singularity , in the context of the flrw model .",
    "we will see that the singularities are not a problem , even if we do nt modify general relativity and we do nt assume very repulsive forces which prevented the singularity .",
    "one tends in general to regard the singularities arising in general relativity as an irremediable problem which forces us to abandon this successful theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , we will see that the singularities of the flrw model are easy to understand and are not fatal to general relativity .",
    "in @xcite we presented an approach to extend the semiriemannian geometry to the case when the metric can become degenerate .",
    "in @xcite we applied this theory to the warped products , and provided by this ways to construct examples of singular semiriemannian manifolds of this type .",
    "we will develop here some ideas suggested in some of the examples presented there , and apply them to the singularities in the flrw spacetime .",
    "we will see that the singularities of the flrw metric are even simpler than the black hole singularities , which we discussed in @xcite .",
    "let s consider the @xmath0-space at any moment of time as being modeled , up to a scaling factor , by a three - dimensional riemannian space @xmath1 . the time is represented as an interval @xmath2 , with the natural metric @xmath3 . at each moment of time",
    "@xmath4 , the space @xmath5 is obtaining by scaling @xmath1 with a scaling factor @xmath6 . the scaling factor is therefore given by a function @xmath7 , named the _",
    "warping function_. the flrw spacetime is the spacetime @xmath8 endowed with the metric @xmath9 it is the _ warped product _ between @xmath1 and @xmath10 , with the warping function @xmath7 .",
    "the typical space @xmath11 can be any riemannian manifold we may need for our cosmological model , but because of the homogeneity and isotropy conditions , it is in general taken to be , at least at large scale , one of the homogeneous spaces @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . in this case , the metric on @xmath11 is , in spherical coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 for the @xmath0-sphere @xmath12 , @xmath18 for the euclidean space @xmath13 , and @xmath19 for the hyperbolic space @xmath14 .",
    "once we choose the @xmath0-space @xmath11 , the only unknown part of the flrw metric is the function @xmath20 . to determine it , we have to make some assumptions about the matter in the universe . in general",
    "it is assumed , for simplicity , that the universe is filled with a fluid with mass density @xmath21 and pressure density @xmath22 .",
    "the density and the pressure are taken to depend on @xmath23 only , because we assume the universe to be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the timelike vector field @xmath26 , normalized .    from the energy density component of the einstein equation",
    ", one can derive the _",
    "friedmann equation _",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the gravitational constant and the speed of light , which we will consider equal to @xmath31 for now on , by an appropriate choice of measurement units ) . from the trace of the einstein equation , we obtain the _ acceleration equation _ @xmath32 from these two equations we obtain the _ fluid equation _ , expressing the conservation of mass - energy : @xmath33    let s assume we know the function @xmath34 .",
    "the friedman equation shows that we can uniquely determine @xmath35 from @xmath34 .",
    "the acceleration equation determines @xmath36 from both @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the function @xmath34 determines uniquely both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "from the recent observations on supernovae , we know that the expansion is accelerated , corresponding to the existence of a positive cosmological constant @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the friedmann s equations were expressed here without @xmath37 , but this does nt reduce the generality , because the equations containing the cosmological constant are equivalent to those without it , by the substitution @xmath38 therefore , for simplicity we will continue to ignore @xmath37 in the following , without any loss of generality .",
    "the standard view on cosmology today is that the universe started with the big bang , which is in general assumed to be singular , and then expanded , with a very short period of exponentially accelerated expansion , called _ inflation _ ( fig .",
    "[ flrw - std ] ) .",
    "the solution proposed here is simple : to show that the singularities of the flrw model do nt break the evolution equation , we show that the equations can be written in an equivalent form which avoids the infinities in a natural way .",
    "we consider useful to prepare the reader with some simple mathematical observations , which will clarify our proof .",
    "these observations can be easily understood , and combined they help us understanding the big bang singularity in the flrw spacetime .      to understand the singularities in the flrw model , it is useful to make a parallel with another type of singularities , and their standard resolution in mathematics .",
    "let s consider a surface in @xmath13 .",
    "in general it can be defined locally as the image of a map @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an open subset of the plane .",
    "if the function @xmath41 is not injective , the surface will have self - intersections . another way to define the surface",
    "is implicitly , as the solution of an equation . in this case",
    "it may happen again to have self - intersections .",
    "the typical example is the cone , defined as @xmath42 we can desingularize it by making the transformation @xmath43 which maps the cylinder @xmath44 from the space parametrized by @xmath45 , to the cone from equation , in the space parametrized by @xmath46 .",
    "this procedure is very used in mathematics , especially in _ algebraic geometry _ , and it is was studied starting with isaac newton @xcite .",
    "the natural metric on the space @xmath46 induces , by pull - back , a metric on the cylinder @xmath44 from the space @xmath45 .",
    "the induced metric on the cylinder is singular : the distance between any pair of points of the circle determined by the equations @xmath47 and @xmath44 is zero . but the points of that circle are distinct .    from the viewpoint of the singularities in general relativity ,",
    "the main implication is that just because the distance between two points is @xmath48 , it does nt mean that the two points coincide .",
    "we can see something similar even in special relativity : the @xmath49-distance between two events separated by a lightlike interval is equal to @xmath48 , but those events may be distinct .",
    "the mathematics of general relativity is a branch of differential geometry , called _ semiriemannian ( or pseudo - riemannian ) geometry _",
    "( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it is a generalization of the riemannian geometry , to the case when the metric tensor is still nondegenerate , but its signature is not positive . in this geometric framework",
    "are defined notions like contraction , levi - civita connection , covariant derivative , riemann curvature , ricci tensor , scalar curvature , einstein tensor .",
    "these are the main ingredients of the theory of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the problem with the singularities is that there , these main ingredients ca nt be defined , or become infinite .",
    "the perfection of semiriemannian geometry is broken there , and by this , it is usually concluded that the same happens with general relativity .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a way to extend semiriemannian geometry to the degenerate case .",
    "there is a previous approach @xcite , which works for metric of constant signature .",
    "our need was to have a theory valid for variable signature ( because the metric changes from being nondegenerate to being degenerate ) , and which in addition allows us to define the riemann , ricci and scalar curvatures in an invariant way , and something like the covariant derivative for the differential forms and tensor fields which are of use in general relativity . after developing this theory , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "we generalized the notion of warped product to the degenerate case , providing by this a way to construct useful examples of singularities of this nice behaved kind @xcite .    from the mathematics of degenerate warped products it followed that a warped product like that involved in a flrw metric ( equation [ eq_flrw_metric ] ) has only singularities which are well behaved , and which allow the extension of general relativity to those points .",
    "at these singularities , the riemann curvature tensor @xmath50 is not degenerate , and it is smooth if @xmath34 is smooth .",
    "the einstein equation can be replaced by a densitized version , which allows the continuation to the singular points and avoids the infinities .      in the friedmann equations , , and , the variables are @xmath34 , the mass / energy density @xmath35 and the pressure density @xmath36 . when @xmath51 , @xmath35 appears to tend to infinity , because a finite amount of matter occupies a volume equal to @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the pressure density @xmath36 may become infinite .",
    "how can we rewrite the equations to avoid the infinities ? as it will turn out , not only there is a solution to do this , but the quantities involved are actually the natural ones . as present in the equations , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are scalar fields .",
    "but the adequate , invariant quantities actually involve the _ volume element _ , or the _ volume form _",
    "@xmath52 where by the factor @xmath53 we mean @xmath54 .",
    "the densities are in fact not the scalars @xmath35 and @xmath36 , but the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "they are differential @xmath49-forms on the spacetime , and the components of these forms in a coordinate system are @xmath57 and respectively @xmath58 .",
    "another hint that the natural quantities are the densitized ones is given by the stress - energy tensor .",
    "when it is obtained from the lagrangian , what we actually get is the tensor density @xmath59    the values @xmath35 and @xmath36 which appear in the friedmann equations coincide with the components of the corresponding densities only in an orthonormal frame , where the determinant of the metric equals @xmath60 , and we can omit @xmath53 .",
    "but when @xmath51 , an orthonormal frame would become singular , because @xmath61 . a coordinate system",
    "in which the metric has the determinant @xmath60 will necessarily be singular when @xmath62 . in a non - singular coordinate system",
    ", @xmath63 has to be variable , as it is in the comoving coordinate system of the flrw model . from , the determinant of the metric in the flrw coordinates is @xmath64 where by @xmath65 we denoted the determinant of the metric tensor of the @xmath0-dimensional typical space @xmath11 .",
    "since the typical space is the same for all moments of time @xmath23 , @xmath65 is constant .    given that the metric s determinant in the comoving coordinates is @xmath66 which tends to @xmath48 when @xmath51 , we see that it might be possible for @xmath53 to cancel the singularity of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath55 , respectively @xmath56 .",
    "as explained in section  [ s_infinite_density ] , we should account in the mass / energy density and the pressure density for the term @xmath53 .    consequently , we make the following substitution : @xmath67    we have the following result :    [ thm_bb_sing_resolved ] if @xmath34 is a smooth function , then the densities @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and the densitized stress - energy tensor @xmath70 are smooth ( and therefore nonsingular ) , even at moments @xmath71 when @xmath72 .",
    "the friedmann equation becomes @xmath73 from which it follows that if @xmath34 is a smooth function , @xmath68 is smooth as well .",
    "the acceleration equation becomes @xmath74 which shows that @xmath69 is smooth too .",
    "hence , for smooth @xmath34 , both @xmath75 and @xmath69 are non - singular .",
    "the four - velocity vector field is @xmath76 , which is a smooth unit timelike vector .",
    "the densitized stress - energy tensor becomes therefore @xmath77 which is smooth , because @xmath68 and @xmath69 are smooth functions .",
    "we can write now a smooth densitized version of the einstein equation : @xmath78    if @xmath79 , the equation tells us that @xmath80 . from these and equation",
    "we see that @xmath81 as well .",
    "of course , this does nt necessarily tell us that @xmath35 or @xmath36 are zero at @xmath82 , they may even be infinite .",
    "figure [ flrw - def - pos ] shows how the universe will look , in general .",
    "one interesting possibility is that when @xmath79 , also @xmath83 . in this case",
    "we may have @xmath84 around @xmath82 , for example if @xmath85 , and obtain a big bang represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ flrw - def - null ] .",
    "this is very similar to a big bounce model , except that the singularity still appears .",
    "note that we preferred the stress - energy tensor with lowered indices , @xmath86 , to that with raised indices @xmath87 , because the former involves the smooth metric @xmath88 , while the latter involves its inverse , @xmath89 , which is singular when @xmath88 becomes degenerate .",
    "similarly for the einstein equation .",
    "the two versions are equivalent only when the metric is nondegenerate .",
    "this paper presented several scenarios concerning the big bang singularity , in the context of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker model .",
    "it was found that the singularity is of degenerate type , and the time evolution is not obstructed .",
    "the solutions are schematically represented in figures [ flrw - def - pos ] and [ flrw - def - null ] .",
    "these models only tell what happens at the singularity . at a global scale , the universe may re - collapse in a similar singularity and then pass again beyond it , in a cyclic cosmological model , or may expand accelerating forever , as the present day observations seem to suggest @xcite .",
    "maybe the precedent universe , having @xmath90 , has no big bang at its origin , it just comes from the infinite past and collapses in a big crunch .",
    "then , its big crunch becomes the big bang of our universe , and it starts its infinite expansion .    the cosmological arrow of our universe points from the big bang toward the time direction where the universe expands , which is the direction in which @xmath23 increases ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the cosmological arrow of the universe existing before the big bang points , of course , from the big bang , toward @xmath92 ( see fig . [ flrw - arrow - of - time ] ) .        it is often assumed that the entropic arrow of time is determined by some special conditions existing at the big bang . of course",
    ", the `` entropic arrow '' may be undefined for a simple flrw universe , bur it may be defined in universes which are at large scale approximated by flrw models .",
    "if the entropic arrow is determined by the cosmological arrow , then our model seems to suggest that the precedent universe has the entropic arrow of time oriented toward @xmath92 , and its time flows from the big bang toward @xmath92 , which is what the observers from the universe with @xmath93 would call past .",
