    "new physics above the electroweak scale is strongly required to be responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if new physics includes some particles with mass above the electroweak scale , their flavor structure has great effects on low energy phenomena by quantum corrections . on the opposite way",
    ", we get a sense of properties of new physics particles by observing low energy phenomena such as rare @xmath1 decays .    instead of considering new particles , we can think some new interactions on the standard model(sm ) yukawa sector .",
    "for example , in type - iii two higgs doublet model(2hdm - iii ) we have generalized yukawa interactions @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 for doublets @xmath5 and @xmath1 . here",
    "we suppress flavor , color and weak indices .",
    "the new wrong - higgs couplings @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 generally have different flavor structure from those of ordinary couplings @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in that case wrong - higgs interactions cause flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) problems and large lepton flavor violating(lfv ) decays at the tree - level @xcite . however , if @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have the same flavor structure as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , _ i.e. _ @xmath12 , they are simultaneously diagonalized with ordinary yukawa couplings and make no additional flavor problems .    nevertheless , they affect enormously low energy phenomena since their @xmath13-behaviors become different from that of usual two higgs doublet model type - i or type - ii cases because of the wrong - higgs interations . here",
    "@xmath14 is ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values(vevs ) .",
    "low energy observables such as muon @xmath0 and rare @xmath1 decays have yukawa coupling dependence on their new physics contributions and can be either enhanced or suppressed depending on choice of the parameter space .",
    "this has important implications for low energy supersymmetry models .",
    "it is well - known that low energy supersymmetry is one of the most promising candidates of beyond sm because susy resolves hierarchy problem in higgs scalar potential and naturally explains the electroweak symmetry breaking driven by radiative correction of top yukawa sector .",
    "however , low energy susy spectra are constrained by low energy observables .",
    "the lighter susy particles are , the more natural theory we have but the severer low energy constraints we undergo .",
    "this is tension between theoretical and experimental requirements in the model . in order to relieve such tension ,",
    "loop contributions on each observables from susy particles cancel out one another so that very special parameter regions must be chosen .",
    "meanwhile , models with squeezed susy spectra @xcite can achieve it more or less without special parameter choices .",
    "if we have wrong - higgs interactions , such tension can be relieved without special parameter choices because of the effects of wrong - higgs interactions we mentioned above .",
    "such wrong - higgs interactions are generated by susy one - loop corrections @xcite but there is no reason that loop - induced wrong - higgs couplings are proportional to ordinary yukawa couplings . in this work",
    ", we will show a microscopic model for natural wrong - higgs couplings aligned with ordinary yukawa couplings in the context of beyond minimal supersymmetric standard model(bmssm ) .",
    "further , in our case , wrong - higgs interactions are generated in tree - level by integrating out heavy states and can be much larger than those from loop corrections .",
    "therefore , our wrong - higgs interactions can relieve aforementioned tension more effectively than loop generated ones .",
    "we will show the wrong - higgs yukawa effects on low energy observables and their implications on low mass susy spectra with light dark matter which is preferred by recent experiments such as dama / libra @xcite , cdms - ii @xcite and cogent @xcite .",
    "higgs decay modification in colliders are also briefly discussed .",
    "we consider two pairs of higgs doublets , one pair is heavy and the other is light . by some discrete symmetry",
    "heavy pair couples to quarks and leptons but light pair does not . at low energy scale",
    "much lighter than heavy higgs doublet , discrete symmetry breaks and mixings between heavy pair and light pair are generated . integrating out heavy pair we will obtain ordinary and wrong - higgs interactions between light pair and quarks and leptons .    in susy context",
    ", we have two pairs of higgs doublet superfields , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there is a charge assignment of both higgs pairs and matter fields under discrete @xmath19 symmetry in table [ charges ] .",
    ".charges under @xmath19 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the charge assignment , khler potential and superpotential are given by @xmath20 here we count out gauge superfields in khler potential since they produce 4-leg or 5-leg operators of higgses(higgsinos ) , gauge bosons(gauginos ) and fermions(sfermions ) after integrating out heavy pair .",
    "they are irrelevant for our discussions except higgs - gaugino - fermion - sfermion interactions , which will be discussed later .",
    "it is noteworthy that we assign charges to make heavy pair couple to down - type quarks and leptons and light pair couple up - type quarks .",
    "this is because yukawa couplings of heavy pair are @xmath21-suppressed to be ordinary ones of light pair as will be shown .",
    "top quark yukawa coupling is already @xmath22(1 ) so that if heavy pair couples to top quark , its yukawa coupling must be @xmath22(10 ) or more and we can not deal with this perturbatively .",
    "even though we have wrong - higgs top yukawa coupling , it is suppressed by @xmath23 because of the smallness of down - type higgs vev and nothing interesting happens .",
    "therefore we consider the wrong - higgs interactions in only down - type quark sector and lepton sector .    at the low energy scale , this @xmath19 is supposed to be broken somehow .",
    "superpotential becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25(1 ) tev , @xmath26(100 ) gev are order parameters of discrete symmetry breaking such as quark masses in chiral perturbation theory of strong interaction . integrating out heavy higgs pair @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,",
    "khler potential and superpotential become @xmath27 redefining parameters as @xmath28 and neglecting five - dimensional matterfield interaction terms , we obtain superpotential of light higgs pair and matter fields , effectively .",
    "moreover , we have new wrong - higgs interactions in khler potential such as dine , seiberg and thomas @xcite .",

    "( [ pot : kahler ] ) , wrong - higgs interactions actually come from susy breaking effect , which is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the first term of khler potential ( [ bmssm : k ] ) comes from mixing term between heavy higgs and light higgs in superpotential ( [ bmssm : w ] ) . before integrating out we have the following @xmath36-term potential , @xmath37 from the first term in the third line",
    ", we have ordinary yukawa interactions in superpotential after integrating out heavy pair and parameter redefinition ( [ para ] ) and the second term becomes small correction ordinary yukawa interactions proportional to @xmath38 , see fig .",

    "<S> low energy contraints from muon @xmath0 and rare @xmath1 decays can be relieved and it can be viable to have low mass superparticle spectra with light dark matter which is preferred by recent experiments such as dama / libra , cdms - ii and cogent . </S>",
