    "in recent years the knowledge about the low energy two  pion system has improved significantly , both experimentally as well as theoretically : for the low partial waves phase shift parameterizations of high accuracy exist from different dispersive analyses , either involving data only  @xcite , or involving both data as well as constraints from chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the analyses are based on roy or roy - type equations that respect analyticity as well as crossing symmetry . especially , left ",
    "hand cuts are included without approximation .",
    "in contrast to this , pion form factors or production reactions are often modeled either by sums of breit - wigners or improved versions thereof  @xcite or by the k  matrix formalism . in case of overlapping resonances unitarity gets violated by the former ansatz .",
    "the k  matrix provides a clear improvement compared to the breit - wigner parameterization , since two  body unitarity is built in .",
    "however , in general analyticity is violated . on the one hand , in the standard treatment",
    "not the full dispersive corrections are considered ( in the expressions for the self energies only the imaginary parts and their analytic continuation are being kept and not the full expressions  c.f .",
    "( [ ldef ] ) below ) , although some works include them ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , on the other hand , the left hand cuts are not treated properly  if they are included at all , in order to fit the scattering amplitudes , they are often in the same way included in the production amplitude although there the left hand cuts are different or , as in case of form factors , even absent .    to be specific , in this work we focus on form factors and scattering with the goal to present simple formulas that allow for a data analysis that is consistent with analyticity and unitarity , however , without the necessity to solve dynamical equations .",
    "in addition , we present formulas that , by construction , in the low energy regime map smoothly and consistently onto what can be derived from the high accuracy analyses mentioned above and thus for the scattering even include the proper left hand cuts .    as an example and for demonstration we apply the formalism in this paper to the pion vector form factor , related to @xmath0 scattering in the @xmath1wave .",
    "the experimental situation for the @xmath2 resonances beyond the @xmath3 is at present not very clear : different experiments find indications for different resonances  for a summary of the current situation see note on the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 in the review of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "the formalism presented here could be an important step forward to clarify the situation for it allows for a simultaneous , consistent analysis of various channels / observables . to parameterize the vector form factor beyond @xmath6 gev@xmath7 all studies agree on the need to include at least two resonances in addition to the @xmath3 , which is elastic .",
    "thus , if we include one inelastic channel the pion vector form factor is parameterized in terms of in total 9 parameters  8 for the resonances and 1 additional parameter for the @xmath2-@xmath8 mixing ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] ) .",
    "the number of parameters needed for each resonance agrees to standard parameterizations .",
    "the advantage of the parameterization presented here is that we do not need to approximate the left hand cuts , the consistency with low energy phase shift is ensured by construction and the connection between scattering and form factors is properly implemented .",
    "we found that once simultaneously to the form factor also the data on @xmath9non 2@xmath10 in the isovector state was fitted , the inclusion of not only an additional resonance but also of the @xmath11 cahnnel together with a direct @xmath12 coupling became necessary .",
    "this model , with in total 17 parameters , allowed for an acceptable fit to the data .",

    "one also finds that the phase shifts for the full model largely agree to the input phase in the whole energy range considered ( this is not the case for the phase of the form factor , as discussed in the next paragraph ) as well as to the data of ref .",
    "this happens , since the resonance couplings to the @xmath0 channel are rather small  the resonances show up prominently in the form factor only due to large couplings to the photon .",

    "as one can see our amplitudes largely exhaust the range allowed by unitarity .",
    "this reflects again the fact that in the present formalism all resonances besides the @xmath3 couple to elastic scattering only weakly .",
    "in this paper a formalism was presented that allows for a simultaneous description of both @xmath0 scattering data as well as form factors without the need to model the low energy regime : at low energies @xmath0 phases can be used as input directly . at higher energies the formalism maps smoothly onto the well known @xmath146 method which is similar to the @xmath147matrix approach , however , with improved analytical properties . as an example in this paper",

    "the formalism described here can be applied to all partial waves , especially also the isoscalar @xmath27wave . here , however , it is less clear what to use for the elastic phase shift @xmath34 , since the pronounced structure from the @xmath149 , which also couples strongly to @xmath89 , shows up already short after the phase reached 90@xmath150 .",
