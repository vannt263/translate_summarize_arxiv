    "they coined the term  heartbeat stars  for this class .",
    "the light variation allows to constrain orbital elements such as orbital period , inclination , argument of periastron and eccentricity .",

    "the high - quality light curve shows multi - mode  pulsation and a periodic brightening event .",
    "fig.[fig - lc ] shows the corot light curve together with two running averages ( 300 and 3000 points ) to illustrate the p - mode pulsation and the light variation due to the orbital motion of the stars .",
    "the outliers and jumps were removed in an iterative approach by involving prewhitening of the @xmath0 sct type pulsation and correcting the residuals .",
    "the removal of outlying data points involved a 3-@xmath2 clipping on the residuals rather than the original data . since the pulsation frequencies are well separated from the binary light variation we constructed a simple binary light curve by calculating a fit from the first fifteen harmonics of the orbital frequency .",
    "the subsequent frequency analysis was performed on the corrected data where the binary model was subtracted . in this paper",
    "we focus on the effects of the binary nature .",
    "a more detailed frequency analysis will be published elsewhere , though a brief summary shall be given below .",
    "the frequency analysis using sigspec ( @xcite ) resulted in more than 700 peaks using a significance limit of 6 .",
    "the pulsation frequencies range from 5 to 15  where four frequencies have amplitudes larger than 1.4 mmag ( in the integrated light from both components ) .",
    "these dominant frequencies ( f@xmath3 to f@xmath4 ) are 12.213 , 7.054 , 6.943 and 8.141 , respectively . around the two dominant modes ( f@xmath3 and f@xmath5 ) there are closely spaced frequencies .",
    "f@xmath4 is a single frequency outside of the groups and reveals an exact 3/2 ratio to the dominant mode .",
    "this ratio was also detected among a few frequencies with lower amplitude .",
    "the high - quality of the corot seismo data allows to detect frequency modulation due to the orbital motion . in an eccentric binary system a more complex structure of the side lobes",
    "is expected ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shibahashi & kurtz 2012 ) ) . in our case",
    "we find around the four dominant frequencies first- and tentatively second - order side - lobes .",
    "the amplitudes of the latter range from 6.7 to 20 ppm .",
    "the average noise of the residuals after prewhitening is 1.8 ppm , which transforms to a s / n of 3.7 for the lowest - amplitude side - lobe .",

    "the amplitudes of these second - order side peak candidates range from only 6.7 to 21 ppm .",
    "we show that for low - amplitude pulsators ( highest amplitudes only @xmath7 2 mmag ) a noise level well below 1 ppm is required to recover the rv curve purely from photometry .",
    "fig.[fig - freqmod ] shows the structure of side - lobes around the 4 dominant peaks , where the corresponding modulated frequency was subtracted and table[tab - freq - split ] lists the four dominant pulsation frequencies ( column f@xmath8 ) , the identified side - lobes ( f@xmath9 ) , the corresponding amplitudes ( a@xmath9 ) and phases ( @xmath10 , zero point : beginning of corot observations jd 2454784.565 ) .",
    "the binary nature of this star was discovered in the eso lp185.d-0056 harps spectroscopy programme ( led by e. poretti ) .",
    "the light curve clearly shows a recurring brightening event with a period of 33.498 days .",
    "thus , a spectroscopic campaign was organised with a good phase coverage that confirmed this period as the binary orbit period .",
    "these spectra include 19 hermes and 5 mcdonald spectra",
    ".    the radial velocities ( rvs ) were determined by fitting synthetic spectra to the observations using the software binmag3 ( by o. kochukhov , www.astro.uu.ee/@xmath11oleg ) .",
    "first , the  was determined by fitting synthetic spectra ( both with  = 6800k and  = 3.5 ) to the observations in which the lines of both components are well separated . in total 60 measurements were averaged and the mean values of  = 41.4@xmath12 1.5 and 41.7 @xmath12 1.7 respectively , were determined .",
    "thus , keeping the  fixed for both components at 42  we determined the rv curves for all available spectra by using the same software .",
    "for each spectrum 16 windows were selected to fit the rvs .",
    "the standard deviations for the phases where the lines of the components are separated are 1.5  and for the phases where the lines are blended @xmath7 3 .",
    "the theoretical rvs curves calculated from the frequencies ( tab . [ tab - freq - split ] ) are compared to the observed rvs in fig[fig - pincers ] .",
    "for f@xmath3 the agreement is acceptable , while for f@xmath5 to f@xmath4 the agreement is poor . because the second order side lobes have extremely low amplitudes they are prone to significant relative errors .",
    "hence , we estimate that a noise level of less than 1 ppm in the fourier domain is required to reconstruct the rv curve purely from photometry for such low - amplitude @xmath0 sct stars .",
    "the brightening of the system is at maximum , when the rvs of the components are maximum .",
    "thus , a tidal deformation and reflected light is likely to cause the brightening ( `` heartbeat effect '' ) .",
