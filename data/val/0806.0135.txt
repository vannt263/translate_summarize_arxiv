    "we learned from the similarity solutions of @xcite and @xcite that the accretion rate of a protostar is of the order of @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the gravitational constant and the isothermal sound speed of gas .",
    "the similarity solution is also used to evaluate the effects of rotation and magnetic field .",
    "the similarity solutions of @xcite and @xcite indicated that the runaway collapse can not be prevented by rotation if once initiated .",
    "collapse of a rotating magnetized gas cloud is described by the similarity solution of @xcite .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is taken into account in the the similarity solution of @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended the similarity solution to include shock wave .",
    "@xcite extended the similarity solution involving a shock wave for application to champagne phase of an region .",
    "@xcite found two classes of similarity solution ; the first class describes accretion onto protostar while the second one does failure of star formation .",
    "the central density decreases in proportion to the inverse square of the time , @xmath3 , in the second class solution .",
    "although this solution has not gained much attention thus far , it provides an insight on dynamical compression of a molecular cloud core .",
    "if a dense clump of gas is compressed by an external force , the temporal increase in the density may trigger gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "one can surmise existence of threshold of gravitational collapse .",
    "if the dynamical compression is either weak or short , the clump will bounce back to expansion .",
    "a shock wave will be formed when accreting gas is stoped by the expansion .",
    "the similarity solution of @xcite demonstrated that a spherical cloud can expand even when it is steadily compressed by a shock wave . on the other hand",
    ", the shock compressed gas sphere will collapse owing to its self gravity if the shock is strong and lasts for a long enough period .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the similarity solution of @xcite while keeping its negative implication in mind .",
    "we find the condition for existence of similarity solution describing expansion of a gas sphere .",
    "conversely it will tell us condition for a shock compressed gas sphere to collapse by its self gravity .",
    "we also study stability of the similarity solution .",
    "the similarity solution denies collapse due to the self gravity only when it is stable .",
    "we review the similarity solution in  2.1 and show the method of linear stability analysis in  2.2 .",
    "technical details on the stability analysis are given in appendix .",
    "properties of similarity solutions , such as accretion rate and infall velocity , are shown in  3.1 .",
    "stability of the similarity solution is given in  3.2 and  3.3 .",
    "we discuss implications of our analysis in  4 .",
    "we consider an isothermal gas of which distribution is spherically symmetric .",
    "then the hydrodynamical equations are expressed as @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 here , the symbols , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath12 denote the density , velocity , pressure , mass inside the radius @xmath13 , gravitational constant , and the isothermal sound speed , respectively . as originally shown by larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) , the hydrodynamical equations have similarity solutions , @xmath14 where @xmath15    we restrict ourselves in the case of @xmath16 in the following . substituting equations ( [ sim1 ] ) through ( [ sim4 ] ) into equations ( [ hydro1 ] ) through ( [ hydro3 ] ) we obtain @xmath17 \\ , \\varrho } { \\left[(u \\ , - \\ , \\xi ) ^2 \\ , - \\ , 1 \\right ] \\ , \\xi } \\label{sim5}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\xi } & = & \\frac{(\\mu \\ , - \\ , 2 ) \\ , ( \\xi \\ , - \\ , u ) } { \\left[(u \\ , - \\ , \\xi ) ^2 \\ , - \\ , 1 \\right ] \\ , \\xi } \\label{sim6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath18    we assume that the density is finite at the center since we are interested in application to a starless core , i.e. , case of no star formation",
    ". then the density and velocity should be expressed as @xmath19 near the center .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the flow has a shock wave at @xmath20 .",
    "then the rankine - hugonio relation gives us the condition , @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the the densities of the pre- and post - shocked gases , respectively , and@xmath25 and @xmath26 do the velocities of them , respectively .    in the region",
    "far from the origin , a solution of equations ( [ sim5 ] ) and ( [ sim6 ] ) approaches the asymptotic solution , @xmath27 the symbol , @xmath28 denotes the infall velocity at the infinity while @xmath29 denotes the accretion rate .",
    "the similarity solution can be specified either by ( @xmath30 ,  @xmath31 ) or by ( @xmath32 ,  @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that larson - penston solution has the same asymptotic form .",
    "only when @xmath34 and @xmath35 vanish , the solution equations ( [ sim5 ] ) and ( [ sim6 ] ) have a different asymptotic form , plus solutionsof @xcite .",
    "we integrate equations ( [ sim5 ] ) and ( [ sim6 ] ) by the 4th order runge - kutta method from @xmath36 for a given set of @xmath30 and @xmath37 to obtain a similarity solution .",
    "the infall velocity and accretion rate are obtained numerically as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath37 .",
    "we also obtain the mass enclosed in the shock front , @xmath38      we have performed a normal mode analysis to examine the stability of the similarity solution . in the analysis , the density is assumed to be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the spherical harmonic function .",
    "this particular form is chosen because the similarity solution has no specific timescale .",
    "an eigenmode has a growth timescale and an unstable perturbation grows exponentially , when the unperturbed state is stationary and has a specific timescale .",
    "when the physical quantities vary according to a power law in time in an unperturbed state , the eigenmode grows ( or decay ) in proportion to a power of time , @xmath41 .",
    "see @xcite for the justification of equation ( [ density - p ] ) .",
    "they analyzed linear stability of the larson - penston solution against a non - spherical perturbation , using the coordinates , @xmath42 instead of the ordinary spherical coordinates , @xmath43 .",
    "it is shown that the similarity solution can be expressed as a steady state and an unstable mode grows in propotion to @xmath44 in the coodinates .",
    "the power index , @xmath45 , is obtained as an eigenvalue of the perturbation equations as shown in appendix .",
    "when the real part of @xmath45 is positive , the mode grows in time and the similarity solution is unstable .",
    "we call the real part of @xmath46 , the growth index in the following according to the suggestion by f.  h. shu , the referee of this paper . when @xmath45 is complex , the mode grows ( or decays ) while oscillating",
    ". the imaginary part of @xmath45 is related with the frequency of oscillation , although the physical oscillation period increases with time .",
    "first we obtained a series of similarity solutions for a given @xmath30 by increasing @xmath31 .",
    "the infall velocity , @xmath34 , decreases monotonically with increase in @xmath37 .",
    "it reaches @xmath47 at some @xmath31 and the similarity solution terminates . by compiling the similarity solutions",
    ", we obtained @xmath29 as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath31 .",
    "the curves denote @xmath29 as a function of @xmath31 for given @xmath34 in figure [ dmdt ] .",
    "the accretion rate , @xmath29 , is maximum at a certain @xmath37 for a given @xmath32 .",
    "it increases with increase in @xmath37 at a small @xmath31 while it decreases with increase in @xmath31 at a large @xmath37 .",
    "the former is denoted by thin curves while the latter is by thick ones .",
    "this means that there exists two similarity solutions for a given set of @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ solution ] shows two similarity solutions having @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the solid curves denote the solution of @xmath50 while the dashed curves do that of @xmath51 .",
    "both the solutions have the same density and velocity distributions in the region of @xmath52 .",
    "the main difference is the location of the shock front .",
    "the shock compressed gas sphere is denser and expands more slowly in the solution denoted by the dashed curve .",
    "since the expansion is slow , the solution is similar to the @xcite-@xcite solution for a self - gravitating isothermal gas sphere . as well as the bonnor - ebert sphere , the latter solution is shown to be unstable (  3 ) .",
    "figure [ dmdt - max ] indicates that the similarity solution has an upper limit on @xmath29 for a given @xmath34 .",
    "the upper limit is highest @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "similarity solutions do not exist for @xmath55 .",
    "the implication of non - existence is discussed in  4 .",
    "figure [ l=0 ] shows the growth index of the spherical perturbation , @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath31 for a series of similarity solutions having a given @xmath32 .",
    "the solid curves denote the growth index of modes having real index .",
    "the dashed lines denote the real part of complex indecies .",
    "one of the index is positive ( @xmath57 ) and the similarity solution is unstable only when the shock radius ( @xmath31 ) is smaller than a critical value .",
    "the condition of neutral stability coincides with that of maximum accretion rate for a given @xmath32 as expected .",
    "when @xmath31 is a little larger than the critical , the solution is stable and the most slowly damping mode has a real index . when @xmath31 is large enough , the solution is stable and the most slowly damping mode has a complex index .",
    "our survey is limited to modes having low indecies , i.e. , in the range @xmath58 .",
    "it is however unlikely that we have missed unstable spherical perturbations .",
    "a spherical perturbation induces only sound waves and they are confined within the gas sphere since it is bounded by the shock wave .",
    "a high frequency sound wave has a shorter wavelength and is unlikely to be jeans unstable .",
    "we have studied @xmath59  =  2 mode as a typical non - spherical perturbation .",
    "this is in part because the dipole ( @xmath60 ) mode is unlikely to be excited .",
    "if the dipole mode grows , the inner and outer parts of the gas sphere should move in the opposite direction each other to keep the center of gravity .",
    "figure  [ l=2v=1 ] denotes the eigenfrequencies of the @xmath61 modes for similarity solutions of @xmath34  =  1.0 .",
    "the abscissa denotes @xmath62 while the ordinate denotes the index , @xmath45 .",
    "all the modes are damping ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the solid lines denote the mode having the smallest damping index .",
    "the mode has a small imaginary part ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the mode having the second smallest damping index is denoted by the dashed line in figure  [ l=2v=1 ] and has a real eigenfrequency ( pure damping ) .",
    "the mode having the third smallest damping index has an imaginary part in the eigenfrequency .",
    "the imaginary part is similar to that of the mode having the smallest damping index .",
    "these three modes have a similar damping index of @xmath65 .",
    "the other mode ( dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ l=2v=1 ] ) has a much larger damping index .",
    "figure  [ l=2v=4 ] is the same as figure  [ l=2v=1 ] but for @xmath34  =  4.0 .",
    "again , all the modes are damping .",
    "the damping index is larger than unity ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the oscillation frequency of the smallest damping mode is larger than those of @xmath34  =  1.0 .",
    "one might ask the reason why the similarity solution is stable against a bar ( @xmath67 ) mode . we think that the bar mode is damped by expansion of the gas sphere . since the radius of the shock front increases with the time , the asphericity of the shock compressed gas sphere decreases unless the displacement grows faster than the radius .",
    "when a gas sphere is collapse , the bar mode can be excited as shown by @xcite for the pressure less gas and @xcite for an isothermal gas .",
    "we have not yet studied the modes of @xmath68 .",
    "however they are also unlikely to be unstable , since the self - gravity does not excite a short wave perturbation .",
    "we obtained the critical accretion rate above which there exits no similarity solution .",
    "the critical rate can be interpreted as the minimum accretion rate for a high density clump to initiate self - gravitational collapse .",
    "the critical accretion rate can be rewritten as @xmath69 for @xmath70 in the dimensional form .",
    "equation ( [ critical - phys ] ) gives us an estimate for a converging flow to initiate gravitational collapse .",
    "we shall consider a spherical region of which surface is surrounded by a converging flow .",
    "the radius , inflow velocity , and density are assumed to be @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "then the gravitational collapse will be initiated when the mass accretion rate exceeds the critical , @xmath73 equation ( [ jeans1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath74 where @xmath75 since @xmath76 denotes the jeans length , equation ( [ jeans2 ] ) means that the effective jeans length reduces in proportion to the inverse of the mach number .",
    "the jeans mass is proportional to the cube of the jeans length for a given density .",
    "thus the effective jeans mass should reduce to @xmath77 this implies that compression of sub jeans mass clump may result in gravitational collapse in the region of flow convergence .",
    "note that the effective jeans mass is several order of magnitude smaller than the classical one when @xmath78 .",
    "the compression should continue for a certain timescale for a dynamically compressed clump to collapse by its self gravity . if we evaluate the minimum timescale to be the effective jeans length divided by the flow velocity , it is shorter than the free - fall timescale by a factor of the mach number squared , @xmath79    the timescale can be translated into the wavelength of perturbation .",
    "a compressed clump can collapse by the self gravity if the wavelength of velocity perturbation is longer than the effective jeans length .",
    "if turbulence contains velocity perturbations of long wavelengths , gravitational collapse due to dynamical compression will take place somewhere in the cloud .",
    "in such case we can expect a number of clumps of which masses are much smaller than the classical jeans mass .",
    "we thank t. matsumoto and f. nakamura for discussion and valuable comments on the original manuscript .",
    "we also thank f.  h. shu for his valuable comments as the referee .",
    "we have added comparison of @xcite solution with bonnor - ebert solution in the revised manuscript according to the comments given to the original manuscript .",
    "this study is financially supported in part by the grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority area ( 19015003 ) of the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology ( mext ) .",

    "we assume that the perturbation is vanishingly small in the region very far from the center .",
    "in other words , we restrict ourselves to search for an instability due to the internal structure of the shock compressed gas sphere . thus the flow is assumed to have no vorticity , @xmath83    the assumption of no vorticity is based on the kelvin s circulation theorem .",
    "it says the circulation , @xmath84 is conserved for an isothermal ( barotropic ) gas ( see , e.g. , chapter 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "since the lagrangian loop _",
    "c _ expands , the circulation velocity should decrease with the time to conserve @xmath85 , although it can grow with the time if measured at a given @xmath86 .",

    "this is because the unperturbed state ( similarity solution ) is spherically symmetric .",
    "we must consider the jump condition at the shock front as well as the boundary conditions to solve the perturbation equation .",
    "the density perturbation is discontinuous between the pre- and post - shocked flows and contains change due to shift of the shock front .",
    "the latter introduces the dirac s delta function proportional to the shift and the density difference between the pre- and post flows .",

    "the symbols with the subscripts , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , denote the values at @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the perturbation in the potential , @xmath97 , is continuous even at @xmath98 .",
    "these jump conditions enable us to connect the perturbation in the post - shocked flow ( @xmath99 ) and that in the pre - shocked flow ( @xmath100 ) .    when the perturbation is spherically symmetric ( @xmath101 ) , equations ( [ delta - rho ] ) and ( [ delta - gamma ] ) are linearly dependent and we obtain @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "thus we need two independent boundary conditions for @xmath101 and three for @xmath104 .",
    "the spherical perturbation should vanish in the pre - shocked since the unperturbed flow is supersonic .",
    "otherwise the perturbation diverges when the mode is unstable .",
    "thus the effective outer boundary is set at @xmath105 and the jump condition is applied there . the other boundary condition is set so that the velocity perturbation vanishes at the origin , @xmath36 and is proportional to @xmath86 near the origin .",
    "we have integrated the perturbation equation numerically with the runge - kutta method from the origin and searched the eigenvalue , @xmath45 , by try and error .",
    "non - spherical perturbations should also be regular at the origin and vanishingly small at infinity .",
    "we calculated asymptotic solutions around the origin and those around the infinity to examine the condition for perturbations to be regular according to @xcite .",
    "some asymptotic solutions are divergent since the perturbation equations are singular at the origin and infinity .",

    "here , the symbol @xmath114 denotes an arbitrary constant .",
