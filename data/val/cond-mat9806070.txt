    "the harper model@xcite may be considered as the most important system in the realm of quasi - periodic systems .",
    "it is described by the one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath3 are real valued parameters , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath6 . depending on whether @xmath0 is rational or irrational",
    "this hamiltonian is periodic or quasi - periodic , resp .",
    "the model exhibits rich spectral features which showed up for the first time in the numerical work of hofstadter@xcite who computed its spectrum for @xmath7 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the beautiful resulting graph ( fig .",
    "1 ) is today known as hofstadter s butterfly and has attracted a lot of attention among physicists and mathematicians ever since .    from a physical point of view",
    "the harper model was first introduced to describe electrons moving in a two - dimensional periodic potential with a square unit cell and subjected to a weak magnetic field perpendicular to the potential plane@xcite . in this case",
    ", harper s model describes the eigenfunctions in one direction of the underlying bravais lattice after separating plane waves in the perpendicular direction .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath2 is twice the ratio of the modulation amplitudes in these two directions , @xmath0 is given by the number of magnetic flux quanta per unit cell of the potential , and @xmath3 is the wave number of the plane wave being separated .",
    "such a system can be realized , e.g. , by lateral superlattices on semiconductor heterostructures in which the first experimental indications of hofstadter s butterfly were found recently@xcite .",
    "harper s model also appeared in the opposite limit , namely for electrons in a two - dimensional periodic potential with strong magnetic field@xcite , as well as in other physical contexts , e.g. , phonons in a quasi - periodic potential@xcite and superconducting networks@xcite .",
    "apart from describing real physical systems it is an important and simple model exhibiting a metal - insulator transition@xcite : if @xmath0 is a typical irrational , then for @xmath8 all eigenfunctions are extended while for @xmath9 they are localized .",
    "hence , at @xmath7 a metal - insulator transition occurs and unusual properties of the spectrum and the eigenfunctions are expected .",
    "this has led mathematicians to study harper s model as a simple example of a system with a possibly singular continuous spectrum . in particular , at @xmath7 the spectrum has been conjectured to be a zero measure cantor set for irrational values of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "this has been shown for a large class of irrationals by helffer and sjstrand@xcite and last@xcite , which , however , do not cover the irrationals typically used in numerical investigations , namely irrationals with bounded continued fraction expansions , e.g. , the golden mean @xmath10 .",
    "so still the question remains whether the spectrum is a zero measure cantor set for _ all _ irrational values of @xmath0  @xcite .    for both , physicists and mathematicians ,",
    "the harper model is also an important example for the study of the relation between the spectral properties and the dynamics of quantum systems @xcite . in 1988 ,",
    "hiramoto and abe numerically discovered anomalous diffusive spreading of wave packets in the harper model for @xmath11@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model has been used for testing relations proposed between the fractal properties of the spectral measure and the temporal decay of autocorrelations@xcite as well as for the asymptotic growth of the moments of a wave packet@xcite . in these studies",
    "one is thus interested in fractal properties of the spectrum , the easiest being the hausdorff dimension .",
    "first , it was investigated numerically@xcite and recently a perturbative calculation has been presented for @xmath0 the golden and the silver mean@xcite . for a class of irrationals , which has zero lebesgue measure , last proved the hausdorff dimension to be bounded from above by 1/2@xcite .",
    "it remains open whether this bound is valid for _ all _ irrationals .    in this article",
    "we study the operator  ( [ haop ] ) at the critical point @xmath11 . based on a numerical analysis",
    "we present our conjecture that there is a constant @xmath12 such that the spectrum for any value of @xmath0 can be covered by the @xmath13 bands of the spectrum for any rational approximant @xmath14 of @xmath0 after stretching each of these bands by a factor smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "this conjecture permits us to prove for _ all _ irrational @xmath0 that the spectrum is ( i ) a zero measure cantor set and has ( ii ) a hausdorff dimension less or equal to 1/2 . after presenting the relevant basic facts on harper s operator in sec .",
    "ii , in sec .",
    "iii we precisely state our conjecture and deduce the above mentioned statements on the measure of the spectrum and its hausdorff dimension .",
    "section  iv contains a thorough numerical analysis of hofstadter s butterfly substantiating the validity of our conjecture .",
    "in the following we review the facts about the spectrum of harper s operator [ eq .",
    "( [ haop ] ) ] that are used in the proofs presented in sec .",
    "the relevant energy spectrum @xmath15 of the harper model for @xmath7 and a fixed value of @xmath0 is given by the set @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the spectrum of @xmath18 .",
    "figure  1 shows @xmath15 vs. @xmath0 , the so - called hofstadter butterfly  @xcite , revealing its symmetries with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    for rational @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath13 relatively prime , the operator  ( [ haop ] ) is periodic and @xmath15 consists of @xmath13 bands .",
    "these bands are separated by @xmath23 gaps in the case of @xmath13 odd and @xmath24 gaps for @xmath13 even , for which the middle bands touch each other at @xmath19@xcite .",
    "the lebesgue measure @xmath25 of the spectrum obeys@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27    for irrational values of @xmath0 , the operator  ( [ haop ] ) is quasi - periodic and its spectrum contains no isolated points as follows from general results on ergodic jacobi matrices  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is independent of @xmath3@xcite , such that @xmath15 is a closed set . thus , if @xmath15 has measure zero it will be nowhere dense and therefore will be a cantor set . as the measure @xmath25 of rational approximants @xmath14 of @xmath0 decreases to zero with increasing @xmath13 [ eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) ] , one may naively think that indeed @xmath28 holds .",
    "_ rigorously _ , however , @xmath29 can only be shown to vanish for two classes of irrationals @xmath0 : one class consists of the irrationals for which all coefficients in the continued fraction expansion are larger than some constant@xcite , while the irrationals in the other class have an unbounded continued fraction expansion@xcite .",
    "the latter proof uses a continuity property of the spectrum , namely that the spectrum @xmath15 is hlder continuous of order 1/2@xcite , i.e. , for every eigenvalue @xmath30 in the spectrum for @xmath0 there is a nearby eigenvalue @xmath31 in the spectrum for @xmath32 with @xmath33 this allows to construct a sequence of covers of @xmath15 using the approximants @xmath34 of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath0 . for each @xmath6 one attaches intervals of length @xmath35 to each of the @xmath36 band edges of @xmath37 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ holder ] ) this defines a cover @xmath38 of @xmath15 consisting of @xmath39 intervals .",
    "the measure of any of these covers is @xmath40 by eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) .",
    "for @xmath41 the measure vanishes only if @xmath42 , which is fulfilled for irrationals with an unbounded continued fraction expansion and proves a zero measure cantor set spectrum for these irrationals  @xcite . for general @xmath0 , which fulfill @xmath43 for some constant @xmath44 , covers as described above do not permit to show @xmath28 .",
    "with respect to the hausdorff dimension these covers have been used by last  @xcite to show an upper bound of 1/2 for the zero measure set of irrationals fulfilling @xmath45 for all @xmath6 and some constant @xmath46 . in the following , we will present a conjecture , stating that there is a useful cover obtained by stretching the bands of a rational approximant of @xmath0 . assuming this conjecture we prove that the lebesgue measure of the spectrum is zero as well as that its hausdorff dimension is less or equal to 1/2 for _ all _ irrationals .",
    "in this section we will show how the zero measure cantor structure of spectra for irrational values of @xmath0 and an upper bound of their hausdorff dimension follow from our @xmath47 before giving the explicit construction of such a cover and numerically substantiating this conjecture in the next section , we will now discuss its consequences .",
    "one can replace @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ conj ] ) by an irrational @xmath0 as is stated in @xmath49 _ proof _ : let @xmath0 be an irrational and let @xmath14 be a rational approximant of @xmath0 , which is obtained by truncating its continued fraction expansion . then , one can always choose a sufficently high rational approximant @xmath48 of @xmath0 , which again is obtained by truncating its continued fraction expansion , such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the constant of eq .",
    "( [ absch ] ) .",
    "we now define a @xmath13-cover @xmath52 of the spectrum for @xmath0 using the continuity property eq .",
    "( [ holder ] ) . to this end",
    "we take the @xmath13 intervals of the cover @xmath53 , as given by conjecture 1 , and enlarge them by @xmath54 at the lower and upper ends , respectively . for the lebesgue measure @xmath55 of @xmath52",
    "we thus have @xmath56 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ absch ] ) . finally , using conjecture 1 and eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) we obtain eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) .",
    "@xmath57    from this corollary follows : by taking the limit @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) this follows immediately .",
    "@xmath57    the cantor structure of the spectrum for irrational @xmath0 is a direct consequence of theorem  1 and stated in : since the spectrum @xmath15 is closed , theorem 1 shows that it is nowhere dense .",
    "as it is also known to have no isolated points@xcite , it follows that @xmath15 is a cantor set.@xmath57    as a second application of conjecture 1 , we now give an upper bound on the hausdorff dimension @xmath59 of the spectrum .",
    "most of the proof is contained in @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are positive constants ; then : @xmath63 _ proof _ : see ref .",
    "@xcite .    *",
    "theorem  2 :* _ assuming conjecture 1 , for any irrational @xmath64 $ ] we have _",
    "@xmath65 _ proof _ : choosing for @xmath66 in lemma  1 a cover satisfying eq.([corr ] ) of corollary  1 and then comparing eqs .",
    "( [ corr ] ) and ( [ lemm1 ] ) yields @xmath67 . inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ lemm12 ] ) concludes the proof of theorem 2.@xmath68",
    "in this section we present a specific cover which is numerically shown to satisfy conjecture 1 . a good starting point for covering the spectrum of harper s operator [ eq .",
    "( [ haop ] ) ] for some rational @xmath32 are the bands of the spectrum for a rational @xmath0 obtained by truncating the continued fraction expansion of @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , there is a natural assignment of any of these bands to a cluster of bands of the spectrum for @xmath32 , which is determined by hofstadter s rules ( see appendix ) .",
    "very often a band is too narrow to cover its related cluster , e.g. , the lowest band of @xmath69 does not cover the related cluster consisting of the lowest two bands for @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we introduce the factor @xmath71 by which the @xmath72-th band , @xmath73 , of the spectrum for @xmath21 has to be stretched in order to cover its related cluster of the spectrum for @xmath74 .",
    "we numerically analyzed the stretching factors @xmath75 for all allowed pairs @xmath14 and @xmath48 with @xmath76 and found that they are bounded from above by @xmath77 if a bound would exist _ without _ the restriction @xmath78 for any two rational approximants @xmath14 and @xmath48 with @xmath79 , that are obtained by truncating the continued fraction expansion of some irrational @xmath80 $ ] , then the cover described above would fulfill conjecture 1 . in the remaining part of this section",
    "we will argue with the help of further numerical analysis that this is very likely to be the case .",
    "we first investigate for which bands and field values the maximum stretching factor for a fixed @xmath13 occurs .",
    "we observe that the maximum stretching factor always occurs when covering the spectrum for @xmath81 with the bands of the spectrum for @xmath82 . at these magnetic fields",
    "the maximum stretching factor stems from the central bands , namely @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the integer part of @xmath85 .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) the maximum stretching factor occurs when using the second band of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) to cover the cluster containing the second and third band of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows @xmath92 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "it has a maximum value of about 2.015 at @xmath93 and is asymptotically decreasing towards 2 , so that it is bounded from above .",
    "this behaviour is substantiated ( fig .",
    "2 ) by using results from thouless and tan@xcite giving an approximation of the band edges for magnetic fields of the form @xmath82 .    since hofstadter",
    "s butterfly is self - similar , one expects that the stretching factors coming from smaller distorted copies of the butterfly play an important role .",
    "in fact , one may wonder if they require larger stretching factors , because of their distortion .",
    "for example , such a copy lives between the lowest two bands of 1/3 and 1/2 ( fig .",
    "1 ) with an effective magnetic field @xmath94 given by @xmath95 . assuming that in the smaller copies the same bands as in the original butterfly need the largest stretching factors , we investigated the stretching factors of the center bands of this distorted copy for @xmath96 when covering the spectrum for @xmath97 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .  2 ( crosses ) they converge towards the corresponding stretching factors of the original butterfly , however , with deviations for small @xmath98 .",
    "a systematic analysis of these deviations also for other small copies of the butterfly shows that these deviations are bounded ( fig .",
    "this suggests that eq .",
    "( [ maxrf ] ) remains valid even without the restriction @xmath76 and thereby gives strong numerical evidence for the validity of conjecture 1 .",
    "we have conjectured that the spectrum of the harper operator for a rational value of the incommensurability parameter @xmath0 can be covered by the spectrum for a rational approximant of @xmath0 after stretching the bands of the latter by a factor @xmath12 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this factor is numerically found to be @xmath99 .",
    "we showed that from this conjecture follows that the spectrum is a zero measure cantor set for _ all _ irrational @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it implies that the hausdorff dimension of these spectra is bounded from above by 1/2 .",
    "while these results are for irrational values of @xmath0 , the underlying conjecture is stated for pairs of rational values of @xmath0 .",
    "this allowed a detailed numerical study giving strong numerical evidence for our conjecture .",
    "as we give an explicit construction of the cover used for the conjecture , we hope that our numerical approach is helpful in finding a rigorous proof of these results .",
    "this work was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "we thank david damanik for useful discussions .",
    "r.k . thanks w.  kohn and d.  hone for their hospitality while visiting ucsb .",
    "here we describe in detail how the cover used in section iv is constructed using hofstadter s rules@xcite .",
    "this set of rules describes qualitatively the self - similar structure of the graph in fig .  1 . for a given magnetic field",
    "@xmath0 the energy spectrum of the harper operator consists of three non - overlapping parts , one central cluster @xmath51 and two side clusters @xmath100 and @xmath12 .",
    "these three parts are distorted harper spectra for effective field values @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 which are given by @xmath104          \\left\\{\\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle 1-\\sigma }   \\right\\ } & \\text{for $ \\frac{1}{2}<\\sigma < 1 $ }        \\end{cases } \\\\[2 mm ] \\sigma_{c } & =   \\begin{cases } \\left\\{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sigma } { \\displaystyle 1 - 2\\sigma}\\right\\ } & \\text{for $ 0\\le\\sigma < \\frac{1}{2}$ }   \\\\[2 mm ]                \\left\\{\\frac{\\displaystyle 1-\\sigma } { \\displaystyle 2\\sigma-1}\\right\\ } & \\text{for $ \\frac{1}{2}<\\sigma < 1 $ }          \\end{cases } \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 denotes the fractional part of @xmath85 . these rules also apply to the distorted spectra such that the spectrum splits into three clusters , each of which splits into three clusters . for irrational @xmath0 this splitting",
    "is continued ad infinitum .",
    "in contrast , for rational @xmath0 this process eventually stops for each cluster when it consists of either a single band ( @xmath106 ) or of two bands ( @xmath107 ) ; see fig .  4 for @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath32 , where @xmath0 was obtained by truncating the continued fraction expansion of @xmath32 , we simultaneously apply hofstadter s rules up to the same level as for @xmath0 ; see fig .  4 for @xmath109 .",
    "this defines a straightforward assignment of a band with @xmath106 in the spectrum for @xmath0 to a cluster of bands in the spectrum for @xmath32 . in the case @xmath107",
    "one has two bands that have to cover the corresponding cluster , which consists of three subclusters .",
    "we assign one band to two subclusters and the other band to the third subcluster ( fig .",
    "4 ) such that the possibly necessary stretching factors for the bands in order to cover their subcluster are minimized .",
    "by this procedure we assign every band of @xmath0 to a cluster of bands of @xmath32 , where the union of these clusters is the complete spectrum for @xmath32 .",
