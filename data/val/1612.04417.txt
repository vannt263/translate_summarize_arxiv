    "the nobel prize for physics 2011 was awarded for the discovery that the universe was accelerating . @xcite and @xcite used snias  as standardizable candles to infer the existence of an additional component in the energy density of the universe , now called dark energy .",
    "the number of snia observations since that seminal discovery has grown rapidly : we now have hundreds of spectroscopically confirmed snias  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have been used to measure the distance modulus to @xmath3 .",
    "this low - redshift probe of the expansion history of the universe , coupled with the high - redshift measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , has been a vital tool for determining the equation of state of dark energy , and to put constraints on modified gravity models .",
    "snias  are a subclass of supernovae defined by the absence of h lines in their spectra and the presence of si lines .",
    "the generally accepted understanding of a snia explosion is that of a co white dwarf accreting material from a companion star .",
    "the gravitational pressure ignites a runaway thermonuclear reaction that leads to the catastrophic unbinding of the white dwarf .",
    "while this scenario is generally agreed upon in literature , the details of their formation , including the nature of the progenitor , as well as the exact explosion mechanism remain unclear .",
    "the diversity of snias  appears however to suggest that snias  are produced by more than one progenitor channel : no single channel ( i.e , single degenerate scenario , where a co white dwarf accretes mass from a non - degenerate companion start ; or double degenerate scenario , the merging of two white dwarfes ) can account for all of the available observations ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "given the emerging support for the idea that the diversity in snias  observations can only be explained by postulating multiple sub - classes ( perhaps even within the ` normal ' snia type ) , it becomes even more important to clarify any links between the snias  variability and their galactic environment .",
    "much work has thus been expended in studying the influence of the snia galactic environment onto its observable properties  in particular , possible residual dependencies of the brightness and/or colour of the snia after the empirical standardization corrections have been applied .",
    "empirical corrections are applied by linearly adjusting the snia s @xmath4-band peak magnitude for stretch  @xcite ( slow declining snias  are brighter ) and colour excess  @xcite ( bluer snias  are brighter ) .",
    "after such corrections , the residual scatter around the hubble diagram is reduced to @xmath5 mag , which is what enables the use of snias  as cosmological probes .    since the standardization procedure is empirical ( although partially justified by theoretical models , e.g.  @xcite ) , much effort has gone into trying to establish whether the residual scatter can be further reduced by including other observable proxies of the snia s environment and/or progenitor channel .",
    "these include host galaxy mass , star formation rate , metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) , stellar population age , spectral lines width , host morphology and location within the host . for a recent review of environmental correlations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that snias  in more massive galaxies are ( post corrections ) brighter  @xcite , although estimates of the difference range from @xmath6 mag @xcite to 0.11 mag  @xcite .",
    "this effect could be a reflection of the hosts metallicity  @xcite , given the well - known mass - metallicity correlation in early - type galaxies .",
    "several studies have investigated the influence of galaxy morphology and/or star formation rate ( sfr ) , reporting that snias  with a smaller stretch parameter ( i.e. , rapid decliners ) occur more often in lenticular / elliptical galaxies  @xcite as well as in passive galaxies  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence that galaxies with lower star formation rates produce , on average , dimmer snias .",
    "@xcite analysed host - galaxy spectra to obtain metallicity and star - formation rates from a subset of the snss - ii snias .",
    "they discovered that snias  from high metallicity host galaxies are @xmath5 mag brighter .",
    "additionally they found a @xmath7 correlation between specific star formation rate and hubble residuals .",
    "however , no significant correlation has been found between the snias colour and the hosts morphology or sfr .",
    "for example , @xcite used a sample of 581 photometric snias  and applied a series of host galaxy corrections to the hubble distance including metallicity , mass , star formation rate , specific star formation rate and age of galaxies .",
    "they found a @xmath8 significant reduction in the hubble residuals when host galaxy mass was added as an additional covariate .",
    "however , the improvement was less significant for the other covariates .",
    "more recently , much work has focused on evaluating the residual effect of the local sfr at the site of the explosion , with somewhat contradictory results  @xcite .",
    "establishing the dependence ( if any ) of the snias  inferred luminosity on environmental effects is important both in terms of potentially improving snias  as standard candles and in order to reduce any remaining systematic effects .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that snias  in regions of high uv flux have a smaller residual dispersion .",
    "furthermore , reducing the remaining intrinsic dispersion below 0.1 mag would enable measuring spatial weak lensing correlations between snias , a new probe of cosmological parameters  @xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", the goal of this paper is to revisit the question of the influence of the projected radial position of the snia within its host , but using a larger sample of snias  and a more sophisticated statistical analysis than was previously available .    in this work",
    "we extend and improve previous ( null ) results by  @xcite , who analyzed snias  samples containing between 62 to 195 objects .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 62 snias  and found no evidence of correlation between stretch or colour corrections and deprojected galactocentric distances from the hosts .",
    "they also separated the snia sample according to galactic morphology , again finding no effect .",
    "@xcite looked at the first year sdss - ii sn sample ( 137 snias  at @xmath9 ) and considered possible correlations of colour @xmath10 with galactocentric distance , without finding any significant correlation .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a similar analysis on a larger sample containing 195 snias  and again did not find an effect .",
    "one of the motivations for the above studies was to investigate the effect ( if any ) of the radial metallicity gradient in the galaxy on the snia s properties . by selecting a sub - group at high projected galactocentric radius ,",
    "one might hope to select a more homogeneous metallicity environment , and hence a more homogeneous sub - class of snia progenitors .",
    "furthermore , the effect of dust and extinction within the host also changes with galactocentric distance .",
    "the confounding effect of dust along the line of sight is a well - known source of uncertainty ( and potentially systematic errors ) in the empirical correction procedure .",
    "indeed there is evidence that the conventional linear colour correction is inadequate , in that it fails to distinguish between intrinsic colour variations in the snias  and host galaxy dust effects  @xcite .",
    "this is one for the reasons of the current effort to obtain light curve in the rest - frame near infrared  a wavelength range much less affected by dust  @xcite .",
    "however , given the high observational cost of obtaining nir lightcurves for a sample at cosmological distances , it would be interesting to determine whether the location of the snia explosion within the host can help select snias  that are less affected by dust .",
    "this could lead to a higher precision ( by using snias  with lower residual scatter ) and accuracy ( by removing or mitigating a potential source of systematic error ) .",
    "higher extinction is expected in regions with a higher star formation rate , and particularly in more central regions of star - forming galaxies .",
    "hence , snias  at small galactocentric radii are expected to be redder , an effect that could be due to the local ism but also to the progenitor s rings of dust , particularly for active , late - type galaxies .",
    "indeed ,  @xcite showed that redder snia events are found more centrally in a sample of star - forming galaxies .",
    "they used the equivalent width of the unresolved sodium doublet ( nad ) to quantify the amount of extinction along the line of sight , finding that snias  with nad detections ( indicating high absorption ) are much more likely to be centrally located within their hosts . largely removing the effect of reddening due to",
    "the ism might help in identifying intrinsic colour variations in the snias  and/or the reddening due to circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "therefore , our aim is to investigate whether segregating the snia sample into sub - groups according to their projected radial distance from the host can help in selecting a sub - group ( at large galactocentric radii ) that is less affected by dust and more homogeneous in its post - correction magnitude .",
    "indeed , @xcite predicted that low reddened snias  would have very little interstellar gas and dust .",
    "this could be either due to the distance from host or the galaxy type @xcite . as forcibly argued by  @xcite , the empirical corrections to the observed magnitude currently implemented in the popular _ salt2 _",
    "fitter might introduce biases in the measured distances , for they bundle together intrinsic colour variations with extrinsic ( i.e. , due to host dust ) variations , especially so at both extremes of the colour range .",
    "if it were possible to identify a sub - group of snias  that are less affected by extrinsic colour variations , this would be a useful tool to access their intrinsic colour variability and use such measurements as cross checks of systematics due to inappropriate statistical modeling of the type pointed out by  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we increase the sample size significantly with respect to previous work , to 280 snias  ( a sub - set of the 368 sdss snias  in jla ) ; we re - fit galaxy images from scratch ( for consistency ) and adopt a more sophisticated ( and powerful ) statistical approach for the estimation of the residual scatter after empirical corrections .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : host ]",
    "we discuss details of the modeling of the brightness profile of the host galaxies , how we estimate the snias galactocentric distance to their host , as well as how we split the snias  into two groups based on this quantity . in section [ sec : bahamas ] we briefly summarize _ bahamas _ , the bayesian parameter inference procedure we adopt to estimate the residual scatter in the two sub - groups of snias .",
    "we present our results in section [ sec : results ] and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we investigate the 368 snias  from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ii supernova survey  @xcite contained in the joint light - curve analysis ( jla ) snia compilation @xcite , spanning the redshift range @xmath11 and with median redshift @xmath12 .",
    "we require estimates of the salt2  @xcite parameters of each snia , namely the peak b - band magnitude , @xmath13 , the lightcurve stretch correction , @xmath14 , and colour correction , @xmath15 . for these quantities",
    "we adopt the estimates obtained by  @xcite .",
    "we obtain the necessary imaging to identify the position of each snia in its host galaxy from the sdss data release 10 ( dr10 ) @xcite .",
    "images of @xmath16 pixels were acquired , centred on the right ascension and declination of each host galaxy , as identified by the sdss - ii supernova survey . given the pixel size of the sdss , this resulted in square images of approximately 396 arcsec sides .",
    "galaxies are observed in five filters , @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we stack the images with equal weights and normalise them to obtain co - added galaxy images , with arbitrary flux units",
    ".    with increasing redshift of the galaxies , each of the bands is measuring bluer restframe wavelengths , and therefore the apparent size of the galaxy might increase in a given band .",
    "the simple co - adding of all the five bands attempts to mitigate against this effect .",
    "a more sophisticated approach would involve re - weighting each band with a weight determined as a function of the galaxy s redshift .",
    "however , @xcite did not find that this effect had an appreciable impact on their result ( when using @xmath22 band photometry only ) , and therefore we neglect it in the present study .",
    "we convolve each image with a gaussian filter with standard deviation of one pixel in each direction .",
    "this helps reduce noise without blending small galaxies into the background .",

    "the scale length then gives the characteristic scale by which to measure the projected distance ( i.e. , galactocentric distance ) of the snia .    because obtaining an estimate of the scale length does not require sophisticated models for the light emission from the galaxy , we model each galaxy s radial intensity profile , @xmath23 , with a simple elliptical function @xcite , which follows an exponential law , @xmath24\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the scale length , @xmath26 is the intensity of the galaxy at @xmath25 , @xmath27 is the srsic index ( which controls the drop - off in intensity from the centre ) , and @xmath28 is the solution to the transcendental equation , @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the gamma function and @xmath31 is the incomplete gamma function .",

    "this quantity is to be understood as a phenomenological error describing the intrinsic residual variability that is not accounted for by the empirical corrections for stretch and colour .",

    "our approach to estimating the residual scatter , and the colour and stretch corrections parameters is significantly more sophisticated than what has been adopted in previous works attempting to establish the influence of galactocentric distance  @xcite .",
    "the bayesian method adopted here has the advantage of exploiting the probabilistic nature of the model to ` borrow strength ' between sniae , thus increasing sensitivity to subtler features in the data than relative to the cruder @xmath96 approach .",
    "furthermore , we produce a full marginal probability distribution for the value of the intrinsic scatter , not just a point estimate .",
    "as shown in  @xcite this results in more accurate and precise estimates for the parameters of interest than it is possible with the standard @xmath96 method .",

    "alternatively , one could include @xmath66 as an additional linear covariate in the correction term in eq .",
    ", the slope of which would be another free parameter , thus replacing eq .   with : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 , with @xmath124 the slope of the galactocentric distance covariate .",
    "one would then fit the value of @xmath124 together with the colour and stretch correction coefficients , @xmath83 and @xmath125 .",
    "the inclusion of galactocentric distance as an additional standardization variable is akin to how the host galaxy mass correction is usually parameterized .",
    "in both cases , one can either segregate the snias  in two groups , divided by a cutoff value , or use the additional covariate as a linear correction term in the distance modulus , as was done e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the second approach dispenses with the need of defining an arbitrary cutoff point .    in previous studies ,",
    "@xcite investigated the impact of galactocentric distance as a covariate .",
    "@xcite also used only two bins ( ` near ' and ` far ' ) .",
    "importantly , the ` near ' and ` far ' bins were defined by splitting the snias  into two groups of equal size ( and further subdividing them according to host morphology ) , and not with reference to their normalized galactocentric distance , like we do here .",
    "this might have washed out any potential correlation .",
    "a puzzling result of @xcite is that while @xmath15 decreased with distance ( with a reported significance of the correlation coefficient of 4.4@xmath126 ) for the entire data set , the effect disappeared when the data were split according to morphology .",
    "@xcite also adopted ( de - projected ) galactocentric distance as a covariate , finding no effect .",
    "they , however , did not attempt to normalize the galactocentric distance to the host light radius , as we do here .    for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider splitting the snias  into two groups ( with a hard , pre - defined cut ) , and leave investigation of the galactocentric distance as a linear covariate to future work .",
    "the marginal posterior distributions in one and two dimensions for the parameters of interest , @xmath127 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : posterior ] , split according to sub - group and compared with the result for the whole data set .",
    "table [ table : posterior ] gives posterior summary statistics for the same quantities . in both cases , the latent parameters",
    "@xmath128 ( @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number of snias  considered ) and all other population - level parameters , @xmath131 , have been marginalized out . here ,",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath133 are the ( redshift - independent ) population means of the colour and stretch distributions , respectively , and @xmath134 are their variances .",
    "these distributions are taken to be gaussian , see  @xcite for full details .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         we observe shifts in the distributions of the all quantities except for @xmath135 for the two different sub - groups .",
    "the most dramatic difference is in the value of the residual scatter , @xmath117 .",
    "its posterior distribution is fairly gaussian , and has posterior average and standard deviation given by @xmath136 for the @xmath76 sub - group , which is reduced to @xmath137 for the @xmath77 sub - group .",
    "this represents a reduction of @xmath138 in the posterior mean values .",
    "the significance of the difference is approximately 1.4@xmath126 ( computed using the standard deviation of the difference between @xmath117 in the two subgroups and assuming gaussian errors ) .",
    "while this is not strongly significant , we emphasize the small sample size ( @xmath139 for the @xmath77 sub - group ) , which results in a fairly wide posterior distribution for @xmath117 .",
    "this means that snias  at large galactocentric distances show better standardization properties ( i.e. , are more uniform in their magnitudes after corrections ) than the whole data set .",
    "this is additionally supported by fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_residual ] , showing the hubble residuals of the two sub - groups .",
    "the right / red ( @xmath119 ) residuals are clearly smaller than the left / blue ones ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "snias  further away from the centre of the galaxy have , on average , smaller residuals after corrections .",
    "therefore , cosmological distance estimation from this sub - group can be expected to be more precise .    , while the right panel shows snias  with @xmath119 .",
    "error bars are the posterior standard deviation of the hubble residual value . also shown as horizontal dashed blue / red lines",
    "is the posterior mean of the residual scatter , @xmath117 , given in table  [ table : posterior ] . ]",
    "we show in figures  [ fig : latent_colour ] and  [ fig : latent_m ] the inferred posterior mean and standard deviation for the latent colour and ( post - correction ) intrinsic magnitude for each snia , fit separately for the two subgroups .",
    "[ fig : latent_colour ] shows that indeed the @xmath77 sub - group has a latent colour distribution that is skewed towards bluer objects . from fig .",
    "[ fig : latent_m ] we observe that the @xmath77 sub - group distribution of intrinsic magnitudes is tighter .",
    "also , the population averages for the two sub - groups ( represented by horizontal dashed lines ) are indistinguishable .",
    "this means that we do not find any evidence for intrinsic differences in the average , post - correction magnitudes in the snias  in the two sub - groups .",
    "one could imagine that the explanation for this effect might lie in the reduced amount of dust found at high galactocentric radii : since the observed colour variation is the sum of intrinsic colour variability and reddening due to the host galaxy and/or local circumstellar material ( csm ) dust ( which varies from host to host ) , reducing the host galaxy colour variability should lead to a smaller residual scatter after correction , as observed in our findings .",
    "however , this interpretation is at odds with the results for the value of the colour correction coefficient , @xmath125 . while differences in the posteriors for @xmath83 and @xmath125 between the two sub - groups are less pronounced",
    ", we do observe a ( very modest ) shift to larger values of both @xmath83 and @xmath125 for the @xmath77 sub - group .",
    "of particular interest for our discussion is the value of the colour correction parameter , @xmath125 .",
    "there is evidence @xcite that the local csm might have smaller size dust grains ( compared to the milky way ) , leading to a smaller value of the total - to - selective extinction @xmath140   than the average milky way value of @xmath141 . here",
    ", @xmath142 is the extinction ( in mag ) in band @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the apparent magnitude in band @xmath143 and @xmath146 is the apparent magnitude in the same band in the absence of extinction .",
    "the colour excess @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 . given that total extinction and reddening is the cumulative effect of local csm dust and ism dust , if the effect of the ism were largely removed by the cut to large @xmath66 , one would expect this sub - group to exhibit the reddening law of the underlying csm , which is typically steeper band is approximately linear in @xmath149 with slope @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the wavelength  @xcite .",
    "hence a smaller value of @xmath152 results in a steeper reddening law .",
    "] than the milky way value .",
    "for example , for sn2014j  @xcite found evidence of a luminous arc  attributed to the csm  with an estimated @xmath153 .",
    "recall that , from eq .",
    ", @xmath125 is the slope that gives the change in @xmath4 band magnitude for a unit change in the value of @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 ought to be compared to @xmath155 . given their respective definitions , it follows that @xmath156 , hence @xmath157 . from this",
    ", one would expect that reddening due to the csm should typically show @xmath158 , i.e. , a much smaller value than we observe in the @xmath77 sub - sample , for which @xmath159 .",
    "alternatively , in the absence of csm reddening one would expect the inferred value of @xmath125 for the @xmath77 sub - sample to recover the value associated with the intrinsic colour variability of the snias .",
    "this has been estimated by @xcite in a low - redshift sample , finding @xmath160 , again much lower than the value we obtain for our sub - sample at high galactocentric distance .",
    "@xcite argue that the simple linear colour correction formula ( which we adopt in this work , in line with standard usage ) effectively averages between the intrinsic colour correction , @xmath161 , and the reddening law slope .",
    "thus one would expect that if indeed the @xmath77 sub - group had negligible reddening due to the ism , we would observe a value of @xmath125 that averages between the @xmath162 value found by  @xcite and the csm reddening law , equivalent to @xmath163 .",
    "thus the inferred @xmath125 for the @xmath77 sub - group ought to be around 2.2 , which is not what we observe .",
    "@xcite analysed the first set of low - redshift snias  from the carnegie supernovae project ( csp ) , and found @xmath164 ( @xmath165 for the entire set of snias .",
    "when excluding two highly reddened snias  from their analysis , they obtained @xmath166 ( @xmath167 , similar to our higher value for the @xmath77 sub - group .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the late - time @xcite law to select a low - reddening sample of 34 snias  from the carnegie supernovae project ( csp ) .",
    "their approach circumvents the use of galactocentric distance , which can be expected to assign to the @xmath76 sub - group snias  that are low reddened but at small projected radii ( i.e. , in front of the host ) .",
    "@xcite then employed a bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct the reddening law of the host ( under a number of priors ) .",
    "they found that objects with the least reddening ( @xmath168 ) have a reddening law compatible with the milky way value of @xmath169 ( corresponding to @xmath170 ) .",
    "this is compatible with our observation of a shift of @xmath125 to larger values in the @xmath77 group , which ( being the bluer sub - group ) exhibits the least reddening .",
    "this thus hints at the possibility that the shift of @xmath125 to higher values for the @xmath77 sub - group is compatible with the hypothesis that the remaining reddening is due to the host ism .",
    "furthermore , despite not finding any correlation between colour and galactocentric distance , @xcite do observe an excess of redder colour values at low galactocentric distances , compatible with the later findings of @xcite .",
    "another heuristic ( if counterintuitive ) argument in support of our findings comes from the fact that less massive galaxies ( with stellar mass @xmath171 ) show a larger value of @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are also the ones with the least dusty environments  @xcite .",
    "hence a larger value of @xmath125 can be associated with less dusty environments .    , colour coded according to the two sub - groups ( split at @xmath172 ) .",
    "the histograms at the margins show the 1d marginal distribution of latent colour values for the two subgroups .",
    "the @xmath77 sub - group clearly shows a preferentially bluer colour ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the vertical errorbars give the average posterior standard deviation in the values of @xmath99 for each of the two sub - groups .",
    "[ fig : latent_colour ] ]    ) exhibit a tighter distribution around the mean magnitude .",
    "the vertical errorbars give the average posterior standard deviation in the values of @xmath114 for each of the two sub - groups .",
    "[ fig : latent_m ] ]    taken all together , the above arguments lend credence to the hypothesis that the large @xmath66 sub - group is actually probing a low - reddening / low - attenuation ism environment , rather than seeing the underlying csm / intrinsic colour scatter .",
    "the reduction in residual intrinsic scatter we observe could be the resultant of the @xmath77 sub - group being subject to a less dusty ism , as well as to the more homogeneous metallicity and sfr environment for this sub - group .",
    "further work is required to disentangle the physical origin of this effect , and we comment on this aspect in the next section .    in this work",
    "we have not divided hosts in terms of their morphology . since",
    "early - type galaxies are dominated by old stars and relatively dust - free  @xcite , while spirals have star - forming activity in the arms and a diverse ( age - wise ) stellar population , snias  that occur in early - type galaxies are less likely to be significantly affected by dust . in spirals ,",
    "central stars tend to be both older and metal rich than in outer regions , and therefore classifying snias  according to both radial distance and galaxy type could potentially disentangle the effects due to stellar age and metallicity from those due to dust properties .",
    "one might therefore speculate that including host galaxy morphology information could help in further reducing the residual scatter , and perhaps in clarifying the origins of the effect .",
    "@xcite subdivided the sdss - ii snia sample in two groups , according to the passive or star forming nature of their host galaxies ( based on their estimated sfr ) .",
    "they found a strong difference in the stretch parameter , @xmath14 , for the two groups , but no significant difference in the colour , concluding that snias  must have the same intrinsic colour variations in all galaxy types .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by @xcite , who examined the influence of galaxy morphology by classifying hosts in three groups ",
    "ellipticals / lenticulars ( e , s0 ) , early - type spirals ( sa - sc ) , late - type spirals ( sd - ir) for 192 snias  from jla .",
    "while they reported 1@xmath126 shifts in the reconstructed values of @xmath173 depending on galactic morphology group , they did not find any significant correlation between colour and host morphology .",
    "this conclusion stood despite a weak trend of slightly bluer colour snias  in early type ( i.e. , passive ) hosts .",
    "this was interpreted as being due to the larger amount of dust in spirals , which would thus make the sn colour redder .",
    "the above studies thus seem to suggest that our results are not strongly affected by the lack of morphological host information .",
    "this work does not consider colour - based selection effects over and above the ( magnitude ) corrections already implemented in the jla sample .",
    "there is evidence that high - z snia are bluer  @xcite and come from less dusty environment  @xcite due to selection bias .",
    "however , our @xmath77 sub - group spans almost the entire sdss - snia redshift range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : distr_dr ] ) , with the majority of the snias  at @xmath174 , and hence colour - based selection effects are unlikely to be playing a major role here .",
    "we have measured the projected galactocentric distance to the host of the snias  for a sub - set of the sdss type ia snias  in the jla sample and investigated the scatter around the hubble diagram ( for a fixed cosmology ) for two sub - groups , separated by a cut in their distance .",
    "the rationale was that snias  at large galactocentric distances might be less subject to ism reddening and absorption , and might explode in more homogeneous environments in terms of metallicity and local sfr .",
    "we have demonstrated that snias  further away from the host can be standardized to a higher degree , in that their intrinsic dispersion ( post phillips corrections ) is reduced from @xmath175 ( for the full sample ) to @xmath176 ( for the snias  with larger galacocentric distances ) .",
    "the statistical significance of the effect is , however , small ( about @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is primarily due to the smallness of the sample ( only 42 snias  in the @xmath77 sub - group ) .",
    "future surveys and data tabulations should be encouraged to include measured galactocentric distances ( and , perhaps , morpholgy of host ) to account for this effect . in a bayesian framework",
    ", it would be straightforward to include prior information on extinction and reddening depending on galactocentric distance and morphology of host .",
    "this has the potential to improve accuracy and precision for inferred cosmological parameters .",
    "future work should focus on verifying whether a larger sample size can confirm this tentative result .",
    "the sdss - ii sn sample contains a larger number of photometrically observed snia , which have not been included in this analysis .",
    "@xcite analysed 721 snias  from this larger data set , and used different host properties such as age and metallicity to reduce the hubble residual .",
    "given the availability of sdss imagery for the hosts , the additional supernovae in the photometric sdss sample could be analyzed to corroborate or disprove this result . since this is a photometric sample , there is a possibility of contamination of the sample by non - snia s .",
    "a bayesian supernova classifier  @xcite can be used to account for this .",
    "additionally , since this photometric sample contain snia to a higher redshift , selection effects may play a major role and have to be correctly accounted for ( e.g. as in @xcite ) .",
    "another , complementary low - redshift ( @xmath177 ) snias  sample is the one used in  @xcite , from a compilation of data including high - quality light curves from the cfa and csp surveys .",
    "an advantage of this lower redshift data set is that detailed morphological studies can be carried out on these relatively nearby galaxies , to verify whether or not host galaxy type plays a role in the correction procedure .",
    "furthermore , the source of the difference in @xmath125 value from the two sub - groups could be elucidated by analyzing them with the simple - bayesn framework  @xcite .",
    "the upcoming snia data from the dark energy survey ( expected to be released in 2017 ) would also be a very useful testing ground for our method .",
