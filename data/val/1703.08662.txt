    "the purpose of this work is to explore the connection between the near - horizon geometry and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the motivation comes from the study of the back reaction of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor of quantum fields on the near - horizon geometry , although the conclusion of our results certainly applies equally well to a purely classical theory . in the study of black holes , hawking radiation is associated with a conserved energy - momentum tensor , which can be computed as the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum operator of quantum fields outside the horizon .",
    "naively , this quantum correction to the energy - momentum tensor , being extremely small , should have very little effect on the black - hole horizon , which exists at a macroscopic scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of horizons in gravitational collapses is known to be a critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "infinitesimal modifications to the initial condition around the critical value can make a significant difference in the final states .",
    "indeed , we will show that in some sense the existence of horizon is very sensitive to the variation of the energy - momentum tensor .    as a first step",
    ", we will focus on static configurations with spherical symmetry in this work , and leave its generalization to dynamical processes without spherical symmetry to the future .",
    "we will demonstrate in two different models of quantum fields that the quantum correction to the energy - momentum tensor is capable of removing the horizon .",
    "we are not claiming that an infinitesimal modification to the energy - momentum tensor leads to dramatic changes in physics .",
    "the quantum energy - momentum tensor outside a static star is extremely weak for a distant observer .",
    "their back reaction to the geometry can indeed be neglected as a good approximation for the space - time region outside the horizon which is visible to a distant observer . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizon can be deformed into a wormhole - like geometry by merely modifying the geometry within an extremely small region near the schwarzschild radius , and the difference can be hard to distinguish for a distant observer .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum operator has been calculated in the fixed schwarzschild background for the models that we will consider , as well as for other similar models , but its back reaction to the geometry have been ignored , or treated with insufficient rigor most of the time . the fact that the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is consistently small outside a black hole was taken by many as a confirmation that its back reaction to the background geometry through the semi - classical einstein equation g _",
    "= t _ can be ignored .",
    "however , we will show that the perturbation theory around the schwarzschild background breaks down at the horizon .",
    "due to a degeneracy in the einstein equations , the correction term to the schwarzschild solution diverges at the horizon .    instead of the perturbation theory as an expansion in the newton constant , we rely on non - perturbative analysis of the einstein equations .",
    "our analysis shows that the horizon of the classical schwarzschild solution can be deformed into a wormhole - like structure ( without horizon ) by an arbitrarily small correction to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the wormhole - like structure connects the internal region of the star to the external region well approximated by the schwarzschild solution .    for static configurations with spherical symmetry",
    ", the event horizon is also a killing horizon and an apparent horizon .",
    "an object falling through the horizon can never return .",
    "when the horizon is deformed into a wormhole - like structure , an object falling towards the center can always return , but only after an extremely long time .",
    "hence , from the viewpoint of a distant observer , an `` approximate horizon '' still exists . in practice , an extremely long period of time beyond a certain infrared cutoff",
    "can be approximated as infinite time .",
    "the horizon can be viewed as the ideal limit in which the time for an object to come out of the approximate horizon approaches to infinity . in this sense ,",
    "our conclusion that an infinitesimal modification can replace a mathematical horizon by an approximate horizon is nothing dramatic .",
    "nevertheless , while the notion of horizon plays a crucial role in conceptual problems such as the information loss paradox , it is of crucial importance to understand how to characterize the geometry of approximate horizons and their difference from the exact horizon .    after setting up the basic formulation for latter discussions in sec .",

    "those with reservations about the accuracy of these models , or any other assumption adopted in the calculation below , should also dismiss the literature based on the same assumptions , and the implication of this work would be at least this : the existence of horizon depends on the details of the energy - momentum tensor , and there is so far no rigorous proof of the presence of horizon that fully incorporates the back reaction of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor in a realistic 4-dimensional theory .",
    "since 4-dimensional and 2-dimensional energy - momentum tensors are defined by @xmath14 respectively , their expectation values are related to each other ( in the s - wave approximation ) by ( or equivalently @xmath11 ) as a classical field since it is originated from the 4-dimensional classical gravity .",

    "in this section , we study the toy model considered by davies , fulling and unruh @xcite for the vacuum energy - momentum tensor outside a massive sphere . in this toy model , we replace the 4-dimensional scalar field by the 2-dimensional minimally coupled massless scalar field , whose action is @xmath22 we shall compute the quantum correction @xmath23 to the energy - momentum tensor for this 2-dimensional quantum field theory and then use eq . to estimate the 4-dimensional vacuum energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 .",
