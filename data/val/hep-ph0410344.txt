    "the hierarchy between the apparent planck scale and electroweak scale is very mysterious , and leads us to believe that the standard model ( sm ) is most likely only an effective theory which breaks down at the electroweak scale .",
    "this belief in fact drives much of the present activity in particle physics , both to propose alternatives for physics beyond the sm and to explore their consequences .",
    "one of the more intriguing possibilities is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model invokes a warped metric ( of curvature @xmath1 ) to explain how the two scales can coexist quite naturally : the planck scale @xmath2 is the fundamental scale of the bulk as a whole , and is the apparent scale for gravity as a result of the graviton wave function having most of its support at the point where the warp factor is largest .",
    "the higgs potential , however , is naturally at the weak scale as a result of it living on the other side of the extra dimension where the warp factor renders the natural scale of order @xmath3 tev .",
    "this fixes the size of the extra dimension such that @xmath4 .",
    "the rs hierarchy solution requires only that the higgs be confined to the ir boundary at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the coordinate in the compact dimension ) .",
    "it does not require that the rest of the sm fields be with the higgs on the ir boundary .",
    "a particularly attractive extension has gauge fields and fermions in the bulk @xcite-@xcite , allowing one to address grand unification , absence of tev - scale fcnc effects , and perhaps even the observed flavor structure for the sm fermions itself .",
    "the ads / cft connection allows such theories an alternate interpretation as a nearly conformal 4d theory , with conformal breaking at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "having promoted the sm gauge fields and fermions to extra - dimensional fields , the possibility arises that there will be brane interactions which mimic their 5d kinetic terms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these terms appear as irrelevant operators in the 5d theory , but as all interactions are already irrelevant , they should be considered a generic feature of any effective theory for extra dimensions .",
    "a specific uv completion could in principle predict their size , but in the absence of one , they are part of the most general extra - dimensional model which one may consider .",
    "further , as is usually the case with any term not forbidden by a symmetry , they will be generated radiatively even if the underlying physics renders them small at tree level .",
    "these terms are of particular importance on the ir brane of a warped theory , where the warping enhances their impact , and it is therefore important to study their physical effects . the theory with gauge fields in the bulk can potentially feel strong bounds from precision electroweak ( ew ) data @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the issue is that the localized higgs vev can induce substantial mixing between the ordinary @xmath7 and @xmath8 bosons with their kk brethren , distorting their properties at a level in disagreement with precision data . in the most simple theories , bounds on the order of 20 tev",
    "can be derived , rendering the theory impossible to discover at future colliders and re - introducing fine - tuning in the higgs potential at a level of @xmath9 .",
    "some of these constraints may be ameliorated by including brane kinetic terms for the gauge bosons  @xcite or by imposing a custodial @xmath10 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "still others could be improved by moving the fermions away from the ir brane . however",
    ", one quickly runs into a problem with this second solution : the large top mass indicates that the top is strongly coupled to the higgs , and in fact the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes are even more strongly coupled than the zero mode .",
    "if the top lies far from the ir brane , the kk modes become so strongly coupled that the theory quickly loses a perturbative description .",
    "thus , there is a kind of `` tug of war '' between the requirements of small ew corrections and a perturbative top yukawa interaction .",
    "a separate issue related to the geometrical picture of fermion flavor arises from non - universal couplings which distinguish the bottom quark .",
    "the small masses of the first and second generation fermions motivate their being located close to the planck brane , whereas the large top mass requires that the top - quark ( including left - handed top , and thus also left - handed bottom ) be located close to the tev brane .",
    "this leads to a non - oblique correction to the @xmath8-@xmath11-@xmath12 vertex which ruins the observed agreement of the predicted @xmath13 with its measured value and can induce flavor - changing neutral currents at an unacceptable level .",
    "in this article we explore a new class of brane kinetic terms , those relevant for the fermion fields .",
    "as argued above , they are present in any self - consistent description of the extra dimension anyway , and they further have great potential to relax some of the ew precision bounds . in particular , since they expell the kk modes of the fermions from the ir brane , they allow for a wider region of localized top quarks without the strong coupling problems alluded to above",
    ". this in itself allows one to consider regions of parameters where the couplings of the sm fermions to the gauge kk modes are strongly suppressed or may altogether vanish . as a result , contributions to the @xmath14 parameter and possible additional four fermion interactions can be made small , which can lead to a much more comfortable situation from the perspective of the ew fit .",
    "they also suppress some contributions to the @xmath15 parameter from kk modes of top , and thus are directly helpful in their own right .",
    "there are still potentially large contributions to the @xmath15 parameter coming from the nonuniversal modification of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge boson wavefunctions , that arises from the mixing with their kk modes through the localized higgs .",
    "as mentioned above , these effects can be suppressed either by including brane kinetic terms for the gauge fields , or by imposing a custodial symmetry .",
    "the net result is that in the presence of fermion brane kinetic terms the ew fit allows lower kk mode masses than in a theory without the fermion brane kinetic terms , and thus more opportunity to observe kk modes at future colliders and less ew fine - tuning in the higgs potential .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : kk ] we introduce brane kinetic terms for the even components of bulk fermions , and derive the spectrum and wave functions . in section  [ sec : strong ] we examine the role such terms play in strong coupling limits for fields coupled to the ir brane .",
    "we find that even for moderate values of the infrared brane kinetic term coefficient , the constraint from the top quark mass on the fifth dimensional yukawa coupling is significantly relaxed . in section  [ sec : low ] we examine the implications for the ew fit .",

    "one would then find corrections of about 1015 percent for the values of @xmath196 consistent with the electroweak observables .",
    "since the relation between the kk masses and @xmath196 is quite insensitive to the uv localized terms , this translates directly into a 1015 percent correction to the kk masses .",
    "this should be compared with the effects induced by ir kinetic terms , that modify the relation between the lightest kk masses and @xmath196 in a much more crucial way , and control the value of the effective @xmath14 parameter , as well as the top - quark kk mode contributions to the @xmath15 parameter .",
