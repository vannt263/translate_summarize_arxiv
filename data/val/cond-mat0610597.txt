    "transition path sampling ( tps ) is a successful approach to characterizing rare event processes for which _ a priori _ knowledge of the location of , or even existence of , a single well - defined transition state is not available .",
    "it addresses the rare event problem by focusing computational resources on the small subset of trajectory space that exhibits dynamically interesting events .",
    "the development of the approach into a computationally effective tool is due largely to the efforts of chandler and coworkers,@xcite and it is now widely used to study the mechanisms and rates of reactive processes .",
    "the tps method prescribes metropolis monte carlo sampling of the transition path ensemble , which includes only those dynamical trajectories of a given length in time that begin in a prescribed `` reactant '' region and terminate in prescribed `` product '' region .",
    "a central feature of the tps method is the preservation of the boltzmann distribution through detailed balance .    as in all metropolis algorithms ,",
    "tps involves a proposal step , in which a new dynamical trajectory is constructed , and then an acceptance / rejection step .",
    "new trajectories can be proposed in a variety of ways .",
    "one approach is to employ open - ended trajectory algorithms , which generate new trajectories by directly integrating the dynamics of the system .",
    "examples of this approach include the widely used `` shooting '' and `` shifting '' techniques.@xcite an alternative approach employs double - ended trajectory algorithms , in which the dynamical trajectories are treated as extended geometrical objects , or chains - of - states,@xcite and sampled using path integral monte carlo methods .    in practice ,",
    "two factors have contributed to the predominance of tps applications that employ opened - ended trajectories.@xcite firstly , for processes that react by way of a single barrier - crossing event , the open - ended shooting and shifting algorithms are very effective in providing decorrelated members of the transition path ensemble , thus rendering a double - ended approach unnecessary .",
    "secondly , the path integral sampling problem that arises in a double - ended formulation of tps has appeared to be prohibitively difficult .",
    "however , strong motivation for the development of double - ended tps algorithms does exist .",
    "many complex systems , including many biologically relevant systems , undergo transition processes that involve slow , diffusive barrier crossing dynamics and exhibit the possibility of metastable intermediates .",
    "these conditions are known to cause difficulty for the open - ended tps algorithms,@xcite but they are naturally overcome in double - ended methods which enable the trajectory endpoint positions to be constrained to the reactant and product regions .",
    "furthermore , recent developments in path integral monte carlo methods and the availability of massively parallel computers suggests that a double - ended formulation of tps can be made tractable .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the issue of sampling double - ended trajectories for diffusive dynamics .",
    "going beyond the coarse - graining efforts of elber and coworkers,@xcite we seek the development of an efficient , ergodic sampler of the transition path ensemble .",
    "we show in section ii that the transition path ensemble for diffusive dynamics can be expressed using a _",
    "symmetric onsager - machlup formula_. in section iii , we show that discretization of this formula gives rise to a symmetric numerical integrator that requires only first derivatives of the potential energy function and exhibits second order accuracy .",

    ", we address the path integral monte carlo sampling problem that accompanies a double - ended tps approach .",
    "we begin by establishing the need for fast sampling@xcite the fine features of the stochastic process .",
    "we also argue that additional methods are needed to efficiently sample the coarse features of trajectories that are long in time .",
    "we then introduce the _ sliding and sampling _ algorithm that alleviates this coarse - feature sampling problem and gives rise to a natural parallelization scheme . in section v ,",

    "must be respected in a sampling algorithm if the usual path integral stiffness problem is to be avoided .",
    "for example , sampling the path distribution with individual time - slice moves gives rise to an artificial correlation between the increments ( often blamed on the `` harmonic springs '' in the free particle term ) which causes poor computational scaling with the number of time - slices @xmath69.@xcite    a solution to this problem is to use collective monte carlo moves for the time - slices , or multi - slice moves.@xcite a general strategy for doing so is to express the diffusive trajectories using a random series representation , namely an infinite series of specialized functions,@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",

    ", we employ the fast sampling algorithm ( fsa ) , which prescribes that each path variable be sequentially updated using the metropolis monte carlo algorithm.@xcite the fsa exploits two key properties of the lc representation to enables the efficient sampling of large numbers of time - slices .",
    "suppose that the path is described using @xmath93 time - slices ( including endpoints ) , where @xmath94 , and consider a particular lc path variable @xmath92 such that @xmath95 . as is clear from the preceding paragraph , changing this variable involves moving only @xmath96 time - slices , where @xmath97 .",
    "a beautiful consequence of this fact is that , for path integrals of the lie - trotter product form , the change in the path integral action accompanying a change in @xmath92 can be obtained at only a fraction ( @xmath98 ) of the computational cost of evaluating the action for the total path .",
    "( this is an unusual feature for a random series representation .",
    "for example , changing a single path variable in the sine function series requires reevaluating the action for the entire path . )",
    "we thus arrive at the key properties of the lc representation : ( 1 ) in sampling a lie - trotter product form , the path variables that belong to the same layer are strictly independent .",
    "( 2 ) the cost of computing the changes in path integral action for a sequential sweep through all @xmath69 path variables in the lc representation is only logarithmically greater ( a factor @xmath99 times ) the cost of doing so in the time - slice representation .",

    "what is so special about the symmetric onsager - machlup formula that requires utilization of the fsa ?",

    "( [ eq : itomanip ] ) .",
    "it is only the very fine details ( the so - called noise ) that prevents the difference of ito integrals from vanishing .",
    "if , for example , a lennard - jones cluster at low temperature starts to suddenly exhibit unexplained liquid - like behavior during a path - integral simulation , the researcher should recall that there are two main reasons that the difference of ito integrals vanishes accidentally : i ) _ inadequate sampling of the fine details _ and ii ) _ a number of time slices that is too small for the chosen transit time _",
    "( not enough fine details ) .",
    "if the difference of backward and forward ito integrals vanishes or is too small , then the distribution of paths is controlled only by the square - norm of the gradient .",
    "the distribution tends to accumulate around the stationary points of the potential , where the gradient vanishes .",
    "however , the simulation has no way to discern whether these stationary points are local minima , saddle points , or local maxima .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the explicit inclusion of the laplacian term through a numerically better - behaved riemann integral makes the feynman - kac formula less dependent upon the quality of sampling .",
    "a central observation of the current paper is the following : although random series representations _ avoid _ stiffness in sampling the fine features of the path , they _ introduce _ stiffness in sampling its coarse features . by using multi - slice moves , random series representations introduce correlations between distant segments of the path . that is",
    ", changing a single path variable in a random series representation generally involves moving a large number of time - slices along the entire length of the path ( imagine , for example , changing a coefficient in the sine function expansion ) .",
    "this is not a problem in sampling the fine features of the path , because the amplitude of the motion is small in comparison to @xmath65 - too small to `` feel '' the potential function .",
    "but the introduced correlation is a severe problem in sampling the coarse features of long paths .",
    "if the trajectories are long in time ( @xmath102 ) , then well - separated segments of the path will in fact be almost entirely uncorrelated - and should be sampled accordingly . by using a representation that artificially correlates the well - separated segments - and attempts to move them over distances that are comparable to @xmath65 - we introduce stiffness .",
    "stiffness in sampling the coarse features of the path is an obvious problem in the context of reactive trajectories , which travel from a reactant region to a distinct product region - and thus involve motion on lengthscales that are long compared to @xmath65 .",
    "however , we note that it is an inevitable problem for _ any _ path integral monte carlo application that utilizes a random series representation and involves long times ( including imaginary times ) .",
    "regardless of the context , we would expect to encounter stiffness whenever dealing with potentials that have a characteristic lengthscale that is short in comparison to the lengthscale for free particle motion ( @xmath103 in the current context , @xmath104 for imaginary time path integrals ) .    in the following example",

    "these observations highlight the importance of methods that actually sample trajectory space .    despite these encouraging observations",
    ", we can not claim that the s&s algorithm achieves fully ergodic sampling in either simulation . in both s&s simulations reported in fig .",
    "[ minmax ] , we see extended periods in which the sampler , although not necessarily locally trapped , appears to be confined within a `` tube '' of accessible trajectories .",
    "for example , beyond the first 100 output trajectories in the @xmath120 simulation , we see that the system consistently returns to a minmax value of @xmath138 . a similar recurrence in the @xmath121 simulation",
    "is seen at the minmax value of @xmath139 .",
    "these apparent transition tubes are analogous to the basins of stability found in configuration space , and the sampler s task of equilibrating them is difficult for the same reasons .",
    "further characterization of these transition tubes , perhaps using the finite temperature string method in coarse variables,@xcite is an interesting possibility for future work .",
    "sweep for sweep , the @xmath120 simulation shown in the blue should do a better job of sampling than the @xmath121 simulation shown in the red .",
    "the former employs twice the fragment length and thus attempts all of the same monte carlo moves , plus those associated with its most coarse lc layer . that the two simulations do not sample",
    "the same transition tube is an indication that the @xmath121 , at least , is not ergodic , and most likely neither is .",
    "however , given the extreme ruggedness of the lj@xmath129 potential energy surface and the complexity of its low - temperature interconversion process , it is very encouraging to find that reasonable transition paths are obtained using the s&s algorithm and that the local sampling of path space , at least , is achieved .",
    "in this work , we have described several developments that aide the efficient transition path sampling of double - ended diffusive trajectories . in particular , we have introduced the symmetric onsager - machlup formula , which can be utilized as the basis for deriving high - order symmetric integrators that utilize only the forcefield , and we have shown that a direct time discretization on a uniform grid generates an approximation that is already accurate to second order . furthermore , we have shown that the sliding and sampling algorithm can naturally leverage massively parallel computer architectures to simulate double - ended trajectories on long timescales .    using a two - dimensional example ,",
    "we demonstrate the computational and wall - clock efficiency of the s&s algorithm .",
    "we find that , because of the layered ( multi - scale ) structure of the lc representation and the fact that the sliding moves eliminate the intrinsic asymmetries of this representation , the computational efficiency of the s&s algorithm is relatively insensitive to the length of fragments employed .",
    "this observation greatly simplifies the implementation of the algorithm - the fragment lengths can be primarily chosen according to the number of available nodes and the desire to minimize the wall - clock time of simulation .",
    "we also employ the s&s algorithm to study the low - temperature structural interconversion of the lj@xmath129 cluster .",
    "we find that , for the simulation times employed here , the s&s algorithm did not ergodically sample the full trajectory space - a result that is not at all surprising given the difficulty of equilibrating the low - temperature thermodynamics of this system with the direct metropolis algorithm .",
    "however , we are encouraged by finding that local sampling of path space is achieved with the s&s algorithm and that the sampler was able to find a large number of low - energy transition pathways .",
    "biological systems at room temperature do not exhibit the same free energy ruggedness that is found in the lj@xmath129 cluster .",
    "but they can still have metastable intermediates , entropic bottlenecks , and exceedingly long timescales , which frustrate open - ended trajectory sampling algorithms .",
    "the success of the direct metropolis monte carlo algorithm in sampling the configuration space of such systems is a good indication that the s&s algorithm will be similarly successful in sampling their trajectory space .",
    "it is in this regime of biologically relevant processes that we expect the s&s algorithm to find its most immediately applicability .",
