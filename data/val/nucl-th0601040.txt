    "the study of nuclei far from stability is an increasingly important part of a nuclear physics portfolio @xcite . as radioactive beams",
    "gradually expand the borders of the nuclear landscape , theoretical modeling of the nucleus is changing in significant ways .",
    "the crucial question for the field @xcite , namely  what binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes ? , \" nicely underlines this point : indeed , the data on rare isotopes with the large neutron - to - proton imbalance indicate that there are many gaps in our present understanding .",
    "short - lived exotic nuclei offer unique tests of those aspects of the nuclear theory that depend on neutron excess  @xcite .",
    "the major challenge is to predict or describe in detail exotic new properties of nuclei far from the stability valley , and to explain the origins of these properties .",
    "new ideas and progress in computer technology have allowed nuclear theorists to understand bits and pieces of nuclear structure quantitatively .",
    "the new experimental developments inevitably require safe and reliable theoretical predictions of nuclear properties throughout the whole nuclear chart in two main directions : ( i ) along the isospin axis , i.e. , going outwards from the beta stability line to the neutron and proton drip lines , and ( ii ) towards the uncharted territory of super - heavy elements at the limit of mass and charge .",
    "the tool of choice is the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) based on the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method .",
    "the key component is the universal energy density functional , which will be able to describe properties of finite nuclei as well as extended asymmetric nucleonic matter .",
    "the development of such a universal functional , including dynamical effects and symmetry restoration , is one of the main goals of the field .    by employing various criteria ( agreement with measured masses , radii , low - lying excited states , giant vibrations , rotational properties , and other global nuclear characteristics ) ,",
    "one aims at adjusting the coupling constants of the functional . by finding correlations between parameters ,",
    "one hopes to reduce their number and to understand physical reasons why different parametrizations yield similar results .",
    "one may also want to expand the parametrizations to cover aspects dictated by physics arguments and/or motivations coming from the effective field theory and qcd .",
    "the main challenges in this quest have been nicely summarized through five questions @xcite :    * what is the form of the nuclear energy density functional ? * what are the constraints on the nuclear energy density functional ?",
    "* what is the form of the pairing functional ? * how to account for quantum correlations and symmetry - breaking effects ? * how to optimize computational techniques and error analysis ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to briefly review the present state of the large - scale microscopic nuclear mass calculations and to discuss improvements needed .",

    "a theoretical framework aiming at the microscopic description of nuclear masses and capable of extrapolating into an unknown territory must fulfill several strict requirements .",
    "first , it must be general enough to be confidently applied to a region of the nuclear landscape whose properties are largely unknown .",
    "second , it should be capable of handling symmetry - breaking effects resulting in a large variety of intrinsic nuclear deformations .",
    "thirdly , it should describe finite nuclei and the bulk nuclear matter .",
    "finally , in addition to observables , the method should provide associated error bars .",
    "these requirements are met by the dft in the formulation of kohn and sham @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of the non - relativistic nuclear dft @xcite ( for relativistic nuclear dft , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the energy density functional that depends on densities and currents representing distributions of nucleonic matter , spins , momentum , and kinetic energy , as well as their derivatives ( gradient terms ) .",
    "standard skyrme functionals employed in self - consistent mean - field calculations are parametrized by means of about ten coupling constants that are adjusted to basic properties of nuclear matter ( e.g. , saturation density , binding energy per nucleon ) and to selected data on magic nuclei .",
    "the functionals are augmented by the pairing term which describes nuclear superfluidity @xcite .",
    "when not corrected by additional phenomenological terms , standard functionals reproduce total binding energies with an rms error of the order of 2 to 4 mev @xcite .",
    "however , they have been successfully tested over the whole nuclear chart to a broad range of phenomena , and usually perform quite well when applied to energy differences , radii , and nuclear moments and deformations @xcite .    historically , the first nuclear energy density functionals appeared in the context of hartree - fock ( hf ) or hfb methods and zero - range interactions such as the skyrme force .",
    "however , it was realized afterwards that  in the spirit of the dft  an effective interaction could be secondary to the functional , i.e. , it is the density functional that defines the force .",
    "this is the strategy that we are going to follow .",
    "the main ingredients of the nuclear dft are the local nucleonic densities . following the standard definitions @xcite , one considers local particle - hole ( p - h ) densities : particle @xmath0 , kinetic @xmath1 , spin @xmath2 , spin - kinetic @xmath3 , current @xmath4 , tensor - kinetic @xmath5 , spin - current @xmath6 , as well as the corresponding local particle - particle ( p - p ; or pairing ) densities : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the local p - h and p - p densities are defined by the spin - dependent one - body density matrices : @xmath14    for instance , @xmath15 since the nuclear dft deals with two kinds of nucleons , the isospin degree of freedom has to be introduced and the isoscalar and isovector densities have to be considered@xcite .",
    "the energy density functional has the form @xmath16=\\int d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath${r}$\\unboldmath}}~ { \\mathcal{h } } ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath${r}$\\unboldmath } } ) , \\label{shfb}\\ ] ] where energy density @xmath17 is usually written as a sum of the p - h energy density @xmath18 and the p - p energy density @xmath19 . according to the dft , there exists a nuclear universal energy functional that yields the exact binding energy of the nuclear system .",
    "this functional includes , in principle , all many - nucleon correlations .    the actual form of the nuclear energy functional is unknown .",
    "the strategy adopted by many practitioners is to build a functional around that generated by the skyrme interaction .",
    "the most general form of the energy density functional that is quadratic in local densities and preserves the basic symmetries of the strong interaction , such as time - reversal symmetry , charge invariance , and proton - neutron symmetry , has been proposed in ref .  @xcite . in practical applications , however , simplified forms of this functional have been used .",

    "some of them are usually adjusted to reproduce the basic properties of the infinite nuclear matter while the remaining coupling constants are fitted to known nuclear masses , radii , and other measured properties .      by varying the energy functional ( [ shfb ] ) with respect to the density matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 one arrives at the hfb equations : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the hfb wave functions , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the local particle and pairing mean - field hamiltonians .",
    "the hfb equations ( [ eq143 ] ) , also called the bogoliubov de gennes equations by condensed matter physicists , are the generalized kohn sham equations of the dft .",
    "it is worth noting that - in its original formulation @xcite - the dft formalism implicitly includes the full correlation functional . in most nuclear applications ,",
    "however , the correlation corrections are added afterwards .",
    "those corrections usually include the following terms : the center - of - mass correction , rotational correction associated with the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry , vibrational correction ( quantum zero - point vibrational fluctuations ) , particle - number correction due to the broken gauge invariance , as well as other terms .",
    "the spectrum of quasi - particle energies @xmath38 is continuous for @xmath39@xmath40@xmath41 and discrete for @xmath39@xmath42@xmath41 .",

    "the norms @xmath50 of the lower components define the total number of particles @xmath51    for spherical nuclei , the self - consistent hfb equations are best solved in the coordinate space where they form a set of 1d radial differential equations @xcite . in the case of deformed nuclei , however , the solution of deformed hfb equations in coordinate space is a difficult and time - consuming task . for axial nuclei ,",
    "the corresponding 2d differential equations can be solved by using the basis - spline methods ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for triaxial nuclei , 3d solutions in a restricted space",
    "are possible by using the so - called two - basis method @xcite .",
    "the large - scale microscopic nuclear mass calculations , such as those of refs .",

    ". furthermore , if odd-@xmath53 and odd - odd nuclei are considered during the fitting process , many one - quasiparticle and two - quasiparticle states have to be considered to find the actual ground state . finally , when the functional has been established , properties of around ten - thousand particle - bound nuclei throughout the nuclear chart can be computed .",

    "developing a nuclear density functional requires a better understanding of the density and gradient dependence , spin and isospin effects , and pairing , as well as an improved treatment of symmetry - breaking effects and many - body correlations .",
    "below are summarized the areas of current theoretical activities in this field .",
    "an important avenue is to enrich the density dependence of the isoscalar and isovector coupling constants , both in the p - h @xcite and p - p channels @xcite . in particular , as the energy functional is supposed to describe those nuclear features that are related to collective dynamics , it seems important to enrich the density dependence of the effective mass in order to differentiate between its value in the bulk and at the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "one of the crucial challenges in microscopic theory of nuclear masses is to better understand salient features of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the symmetry energy can be extracted directly from the calculated binding energy of finite nuclei , after subtracting shell effects @xcite .",
    "the goal is to understand connections between the symmetry energy and isoscalar and isovector mean fields , and in particular the influence of effective mass and pair correlations on symmetry energy versus the isospin . such understanding will allow us to better determine isospin corrections to nuclear mean fields and energy density functionals .",
    "recently , important indications on how to construct the nuclear energy functional have been obtained within the effective field theory ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . even if one still has to readjust and fine - tune the parameters for a precise description of nuclear data , one can gain important insights into the structure of the functional , especially the dependence of the coupling constants on nuclear densities .",
    "in addition , the systematic , controlled momentum expansion on which the effective field theory is based offers a way to estimate theoretical errors ( see sec .",
    "[ errors ] ) .      in the self - consistent method",
    ", the average nucleonic field is obtained from the nucleonic density .",
    "consequently , in a highly polarized high - spin state , the mean - field potential is expected to acquire appreciable time - odd components @xcite",
    ". however , such terms should be present in all nuclear states with non - zero angular momentum , including ground states of odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is rather clear that without getting a handle on the time - odd fields , it will be impossible to make precise predictions for binding energies of most of the nuclei .",
    "the time - odd terms are very poorly known .",
    "an important task is to learn about them through an analysis of high - spin states and spin - isospin excitations .",
    "some of the time - odd fields have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of gamow - teller beta decays in radioactive nuclei by constraining the energy functional to the empirical spin - isospin landau parameters .",
    "the coupling constants of the remaining terms can , in principle , be found by performing systematic studies of rotating nuclei .",
    "this strategy has recently been followed in the skyrme - hf analysis of high - spin terminating states @xcite .",
    "those fully aligned states have fairly simple single - particle configurations , and they provide an excellent testing ground for the time - odd densities and fields .",
    "the correlation term , accounting for correlations going beyond the simple product state , is an integral part of the dft",
    ". since nuclei are self - bound systems , many - body correlations due to spontaneous symmetry - breaking effects are of particular importance . a large part of those correlations",
    "can indeed be included by considering symmetry - breaking product states . within the mean - field approach",
    ", one can understand many physical observables by directly employing broken - symmetry states ; however , for finite systems , a quantitative description often does require symmetry restoration .",
    "for this purpose , one can apply a variety of theoretical techniques , in particular projection methods , the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , and various approximations performed on top of self - consistent mean fields @xcite .    in this context",
    ", it is important to recall that the realistic energy density functional does not have to be related to any given effective hamiltonian .",
    "this creates a problem if a symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "while the projection can be carried out in a straightforward manner for energy functionals that are related to a hamiltonian , the restoration of spontaneously broken symmetries of a general density functional still poses a conceptional dilemma that needs to be properly addressed @xcite .",
    "since the correlation term is a part of the functional , it should be treated as such during the variational procedure and during the fitting process in which the functional s coupling constants are determined .",
    "so far , perhaps with the exception of the center - of - mass term ( see sec .  [ com ] below ) , such an ambitious program has not been carried out . in the near future , one hopes to work out approximate expressions for the correlation term that would capture the essence of results of microscopic calculations performed on top of self - consistent mean fields . in this way ,",
    "the hope is to develop the tractable parametrization of the correlation energy in terms of local densities that would allow an explicit inclusion of dynamical effects into the energy functional .      the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "correction , due to the violation of the translational invariance , is always included in calculations , but its practical implementations differ from functional to functional @xcite .",

    "correction , the surface energy coefficient differs by as much as 0.7 mev . while the two - body ( albeit perturbative ) treatment of the c.m .",
    "correction does not reduce the overall rms error of the fit to nuclear masses @xcite , it certainly has a significant impact on binding energies of highly deformed configurations ( such as fission isomers ) , fission barriers , and fission trajectories .      as already discussed in sec .",

    "the particle - number conserving hfb equations @xcite with skyrme functionals can be simply obtained from the standard skyrme - hfb equations in coordinate space by replacing the intrinsic densities and currents by their gauge - angle dependent counterparts . using the vap method",
    ", one can properly describe transitions between normal and superconducting phases in finite systems , which are inherent in ( semi)magic nuclei .    as mentioned above",
    ", the restoration of broken symmetries in the framework of dft causes a number of questions , mainly related to the density dependence of the underlying interaction and to different treatment of particle - hole and particle - particle channels @xcite .",

    "related to the particle - number symmetry , but different in origin and treatment , is the question of the spontaneous isospin breaking .",

    "the isoscalar pairing is believed to contribute to the additional binding of @xmath59=@xmath65 nuclei , the so - called wigner energy @xcite",
    ". however , basic questions regarding the collectivity of such a phase still remain unanswered , and should be part of the future scientific agenda .    apart from the presence of charge - dependent terms in the functional , such as the coulomb term , the isospin symmetry is broken by the quasiparticle mean field ( the generalized product wave function is not an eigenstate of isospin ) .",
    "several techniques have been developed to restore isospin ( see the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "it is fair to say , however , that in spite of many attempts to extend the quasiparticle approach to incorporate the effect of proton - neutron correlations , no symmetry - unrestricted mean - field calculations of proton - neutron pairing , based on realistic effective interaction and the isospin - conserving formalism , have been carried out so far .",
    "the rotational - vibrational correlations are important aspects of nuclear collective dynamics ; they also contribute to nuclear binding through quantum zero - point corrections . to estimate the magnitude of the rotational - vibrational corrections , one usually applies rpa @xcite , gcm @xcite , or the gaussian overlap approximation to gcm @xcite .",
    "regardless of the approach used , a key point is the choice of collective subspace . in the case of gcm and related methods ,",
    "the collective manifold is determined by the set of external fields associated with the collective motion of the system . in most practical applications ,",
    "one considers five quadrupole degrees of freedom that give rise to nuclear rotations and quadrupole vibrations , octupole deformations , and pairing vibrations @xcite .",
    "an important step towards the microscopic description of correlation energies are the recent large - scale benchmark calculations of ground - state quadrupole correlations of binding energies for all even - even nuclei , from @xmath66o up to the superheavy systems @xcite .",
    "one of the still - unsolved questions is an appropriate selection of experimental data that would allow for a more - or - less unique determination of the coupling constants defining the energy functional . to this end ,",
    "one usually uses certain constraints obtained by extrapolating nuclear data to an infinite system and selected data for finite nuclei . the sensitivity of the final fit to the choice of this data set leads to a plethora of parameterizations currently available in the literature .",
    "most of the currently used density functionals correctly reproduce generic trends in nuclear masses  as selected masses are usually considered in the data set  but their descriptions of other quantities vary .",
    "moreover , they often significantly differ in parameters or coupling constants @xcite .",
    "this suggests that yet - unresolved correlations may exist between these parameters , and only certain combinations thereof are important @xcite .",
    "such correlations would explain the fact that widely different parameterizations lead to fairly similar results .",
    "the present stage of theory requires constructing new energy density functionals supplemented by a complete error and covariance analysis .",
    "it is not sufficient to `` predict '' properties of exotic nuclei by extrapolating properties of those measured in experiment .",
    "one must also quantitatively determine errors related to such an extrapolation .",
    "moreover , for experimental work it is essential that an improvement gained by measuring one or two more isotopes be quantitatively known . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", one must also know the confidence level with which the parameters of the functional are determined .",
    "an analysis of this type constitutes a standard approach in other domains of physics , but they are seldom performed in theoretical nuclear structure research .",
    "this paper discusses the status , advances , open problems , and perspectives in the area of large - scale microscopic nuclear mass calculations .",
    "this field of research is past phenomenological approaches that gave us a very good understanding of general features and trends , but lacked fundamental derivations and had limited predictive power . at present , the focus is on microscopic descriptions of nuclei whereupon they are treated as finite quantum objects built of ( quasi)nucleons . nuclear ground states and masses are in this approach determined by basic fields , which are the particle and spin densities along with their derivatives and gradients up to the second order in relative momenta .",
    "these fields interact in such a way that the total energy of a given system is a functional of densities , defined and understood in the general framework of the kohn - sham theory .",
    "the determination of such a universal functional , along with all the dynamic corrections required by data , is the main purpose of current investigations . in this endeavor ,",
    "we strive not only to have a reliable theoretical tool to calculate properties of very exotic systems that will not be soon accessible in experiment , but also wish to have a spectroscopic quality description of well - known systems , in which very precise data do exist now , and can be used as a rich source for determination of theoretical parameters .",
    "such a program of research should npt only be rooted in the fundamentals of low - energy qcd methods and ideas , but also , by definition , must rely on experiment for elements that can not be derived from first principles .",
    "it is a vast and ambitious program presently under way .",
