    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce to the study of the laplacian on discrete graphs a concept which found several applications in the spectral theory of the wave ( and the schrdinger ) operator - the exterior - interior duality .",
    "it applies for wave equations on manifolds which can be partitioned into interior ( assumed to be simply connected and compact ) and exterior domains separated by a boundary .",
    "one considers now the wave equations in the two domains , subject to the same boundary conditions .",
    "the wave operator restricted to the interior has a pure point spectrum , while in the exterior the spectrum is continuous and a scattering operator can be defined .",
    "the restriction of the scattering operator to a particular value of the spectral parameter is the unitary ( on shell ) scattering matrix @xmath1 .",
    "its spectrum is confined to the unit circle .",
    "the exterior - interior duality asserts that the spectrum of the interior can be identified as those values of @xmath2 for which one of the eigenvalues of the @xmath3 matrix approaches the value @xmath4 .",
    "the exterior - interior duality was first discussed in the physics literature in @xcite .",
    "it was presented in several versions , which differ in the geometry of the space where the scattering operator is defined .",
    "consider e.g. , a compact domain @xmath5 and the wave equation subject to dirichlet boundary conditions . in the exterior ,",
    "the wave equation is subject to the same boundary conditions , and @xmath6 is treated as an obstacle .",
    "the scattering it induces is described in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the exterior - interior duality ensures that the spectrum of the dirichlet laplacian in the interior is identified by the values of the spectral parameters where an eigenvalue of @xmath1 approaches unity .",
    "this was precisely formulated and proved in @xcite .",
    "the wave - guide version which is closer to the present discussion can be crudely described as follows : consider a connected domain in @xmath0 and impose dirichlet boundary conditions on its boundary @xmath7 which is assumed to be smooth .",
    "the dirichlet laplacian has a discrete spectrum . to define an associated scattering system , choose on the boundary two arbitrary points @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "( see figure ( [ fig : int - ext - billiard ] ) ) .",
    "draw two parallel lines , @xmath10 through @xmath8 and @xmath11 through @xmath9 so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are perpendicular to the chord @xmath14 .",
    "consider now the part of the boundary @xmath15 which starts at @xmath8 and is traversed in the positive mathematical sense as one goes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the domain which is bounded by @xmath16 and by the half lines of @xmath17 and @xmath11 to the left of @xmath18 is a semi - infinite channel , terminated at one of its ends by @xmath15 .",
    "this domain will be denoted by @xmath19 ( for  left \" ) and its boundaries are drawn by darker lines .",
    "impose dirichlet conditions on the boundary of @xmath19 and compute the scattering matrix @xmath20 .",
    "repeat the same construction for @xmath21 which is the part of the boundary which completes @xmath15 to the full boundary .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath22 in the ",
    "right \" channel @xmath23 is defined in the same way as above ( the domain boundaries are drawn with lighter lines ) .",
    "the spectrum of the laplacian in @xmath6 is obtained by solving the secular equation @xmath24 this equation expresses the essence of the exterior - interior duality : the spectral information in the interior is obtained from the scattering matrix computed for an appropriate exterior problem .",
    "this version and its variations was studied in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "only a few examples were studied with mathematical rigor @xcite .    the exterior - interior duality was discussed and proved for quantum graphs .",
    ".    secular equation of the type ( [ eq : originaleid ] ) have several theoretical and practical advantages which were used for various purposes in the study of the wave equation . in the sequel ,",
    "analogous secular equations for the spectrum of the discrete laplacian on graphs will be derived , thus extending the interior - exterior duality to the discrete case .",
    "there are two conceptual obstacles which should be cleared in order to carry out this program :    _ i. _ given a finite graph with a general connectivity , there is no natural way to convert it to a scattering problem analogous to the first version discussed above .    _",
    "_ there is no natural definition for a  boundary \" on a compact graph , and if a boundary is defined , the meaning of boundary conditions has to be explained .    in the following section",
    "the above difficulties will be addressed , and the scattering matrices @xmath1 will be constructed in two different settings",
    ". the exterior - interior duality will be realized by deriving the corresponding secular equations of the form ( [ eq : originaleid ] ) for the spectrum of the graph .",
    "a few applications will be presented in section ( [ sect : applications ] ) .",
    "the following notations and concepts will be used throughout the present work .",
    "a graph @xmath25 is defined in terms of its vertex set @xmath26 and edge ( bond ) set @xmath27 .",
    "the cardinality of these sets will be denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the graph topology is defined by the connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix @xmath29 which is labeled by the vertex indices .",
    "it is a symmetric matrix whose @xmath30 element counts the number of edges connecting the vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the valency ( degree ) of a vertex is defined as the number of bonds which emanate from it , @xmath33 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath34 appears in the definition of the graph laplacian : @xmath35    as explained above , and in a complete analogy with the example discussed in the introduction , the graph whose spectrum one wishes to compute will be extended so that it forms the  interior graph \" @xmath36 in a scattering setting .",
    "all the quantities which are related to the  interior \" graph will be denoted by a superscript @xmath37 .",
    "for simplicity it is assumed to be connected and devoid of parallel bonds ( @xmath38 ) or loops ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "in this section scattering on graphs will be defined using two different approaches .",
    "the first goes along the lines of @xcite , the second relies on the graph evolution operator defined in @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", some background material for each of the methods will be reviewed before the scattering matrices are presented .      in this setting , one attaches leads to the graph @xmath36 and scattering is defined on the enlarged graph .",
    "a lead graph @xmath40 is defined as a semi - infinite set of vertices @xmath41 which are connected linearly .",
    "a vertex is identified by a double index @xmath42 , @xmath40 denotes the lead , and @xmath31 enumerates the vertex position on the lead . the lead connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 stands for the number of parallel bonds which connect successive vertices .",
    "( all quantities related to the leads will be denoted by the superscript @xmath45 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the lead laplacian @xmath46 and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath47 satisfy @xmath48 the spectrum is continuous and supported on the spectral band @xmath49 $ ] ( the conduction band ) . for any @xmath2 in the conduction band , there correspond two eigenfunctions which can be written as linear combinations of counter - propagating waves : @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the reason for constructing the leads with @xmath44 parallel bonds is because the conduction band can be made arbitrarily broad . in the present application ,",
    "an appropriate choice of @xmath44 would be of the order of the mean valency in the interior graph , so the spectrum of @xmath36 falls well within the conduction band .",
    "a function which satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath53 ( second line of ( [ eq : leadlap ] ) ) is , @xmath54 where @xmath55 provides the phase gained by scattering at the end of the lead ( as long as @xmath2 is in the conduction band ) .",
    "it plays here the rle of the scattering matrix which will be defined in the sequel .",
    "returning now to the interior graph @xmath36 it is converted into a scattering graph by attaching to its vertices semi - infinite leads . at most one lead can be attached to a vertex , but not all vertices should be connected to leads .",

    "the connection of the leads to @xmath36 is given by the @xmath58  wiring \" matrix @xmath59 the number of leads which emanate from the vertex @xmath31 is either @xmath37 or @xmath4 , and is denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "define also the diagonal matrix @xmath61 so that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64 unit matrix .",

    "they are to be determined from the requirement that @xmath70 is an eigenfunction of the scattering graph laplacian",
    ". it will be shown below that this requirement suffices to provide a linear relationship between the incoming and outgoing amplitude .",

    "using the fact that @xmath88 we get , @xmath89 this is the desired form of the scattering matrix .",

    "_ once @xmath2 is outside of the conduction band , the @xmath95 are exponentially increasing or decreasing solutions - they are the analogues of the evanescent waves encountered in the study of wave - guides .",
    "one of the reason for the introduction of the @xmath44 parallel bonds in the leads was to broaden the conduction band and avoid the spectral domain of evanescent waves .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness one observes that the scattering matrix as defined above can be analytically continued outside of the conduction band by using ( [ eq : free ] ) which is valid for any @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath72 matrix outside the conduction band loses its physical interpretation , and it remains symmetric but is not any more unitary .",

    ". _ finally , it might be instructive to note that the matrix @xmath84 is closely related to the discrete analogue of the dirichlet to neumann map .",
