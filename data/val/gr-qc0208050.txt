    "recently , there has been a revival of interest in the topic dealing with the terrestrial test of the equivalence principle of einstein s general relativity at a classical level [ 1 ] .",
    "the works focus mainly on the phenomena of various types of couplings such as the classical spin - spin , spin - orbital or spin - gravitational couplings [ 2 ] . on the other hand , investigations of the gravitational effects on the quantum phenomena",
    "are expected to provide informations that could be useful not only for testing the equivalence principle at a quantum level but also for the development of a full theory of quantum gravity [ 3 ] .",
    "for instance , a semiclassical treatment reveals that quantum uncertainty in the source variables induces uncertainties in the metric components of gravity in a specific manner [ 4 ] .",
    "another important phenomenon is the neutrino flavor oscillation induced by gravity [ 5 - 8 ] or by the recoil from virtual d - branes [ 9 ] .",
    "a different kind of theoretical approach in the calculations of the phase of quantum particles , neutrinos included , has yielded a very interesting result : the dirac spin 1/2 particle has the exact covariant stodolsky [ 10 ] phase @xmath2 in a static gravity field [ 11 ] . some of these investigations could provide appropriate theoretical backgrounds in the atmospheric neutrino experiments [ 12 ] , or in the observations involving @xmath3-ray bursts [ 13 ] .",
    "recent interests also include the study of quantum interference fringes for thermal neutrons traveling along two different paths [ 14,15 ] .",
    "the interference with itself of the de broglie wave associated with an ensemble of particles allows us to predict , via huygen s principle , the motion of the wave .",
    "the presence of an external field modifies the motion and useful information about it could be gathered if one knows how the external field causes a shift in the interference fringes .",
    "a classic example is the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) fringe shift which provides information as to how the motion of electrons are modified in the presence of a magnetic potential [ 16 ] .",
    "the ab effect predicts the same gauge invariant fringe shift , viz .",
    "@xmath4 between the interfering beams both in special relativistic and nonrelativistic theories , where @xmath5 is the electromagnetic 4-potential , @xmath6 is the electronic charge , @xmath7 is planck s constant and @xmath8 is the light speed in vacuum .",
    "however , the situation becomes more complicated , both experimentally and theoretically , when one introduces gravity and rotation . on the experimental side ,",
    "the developments in the matterwave interferometry have shown a greater promise ( over photon interferometry ) in the measurements of the influences on the fringe shifts due to earth s gravity and rotation .",
    "the neutron interferometry of the earlier experiments by colella , overhauser and werner ( cow experiment)[17 ] and an improved configuration of the later experiment by werner , staudenmann and colella ( wsc experiment ) [ 18 ] provide information about the effects of earth s gravity and coriolis force on the fringe shift at a classical , that is , non - general relativistic level .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a special relativistic treatment of the quantum fringe shift for thermal neutrons has been proposed by anandan [ 15 ] .",
    "however , the effects of gravity and rotation are still considered as separate components while using special relativistic expressions for energy and momentum . on the other hand",
    ", a more comprehensive analysis involving gravity and inertial forces requires the unified framework of general relativity that combines those forces into a single geometrical framework .",
    "the special relativistic effects should then follow as a limiting case .",
    "the current literature seems to still lack such a unified approach .",
    "this has been noted in a recent investigation by zhang and beesham [ 14 ] .",
    "however , they consider only schwarzschild gravity and consequently the relativistic or the coriolis parts do not appear in their formulation .    in this paper , adopting a new approach developed in a series of recent papers [ 19 ] , we wish to work out the exact general relativistic equation of the quantum fringe shift for thermal neutrons .",
    "a  coriolis \" force appears _ naturally _ in the exact form of the geodesic equation .",
    "this gives rise to a gravitational analog of the quantum ab effect .",
    "the curved spacetime contributions to the special relativistic and coriolis effects on the fringe shift are displayed . as an immediate corollary",
    ", it is argued that the measurements of these contributions would establish the validity or otherwise of the equivalence principle at a quantum level . for illustrations ,",
    "we calculate the first order gravitational contributions coming from the kerr metric of general relativity and the kerr - sen metric of heterotic string theory [ 20 ] .",
    "the latter will enable us to also envisage the string effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , for ready reference , anandan s special relativistic ( sr ) approach is summarized . in order to be reasonably exhaustive , we enumerate , in sec.iii , the salient features of the present approach leading to an appropriate form of the geodesic equation . in sec.iv , the general relativistic equation for the quantum fringe shift",
    "is proposed .",
    "two examples are considered in sec.v , while some concluding remarks are given in sec.vi .",
    "in the literature , there exist several deductions of the individual parts of the special relativistic contributions to quantum phase shift [ 10,15,21,22 ] .",
    "however , using intuitive arguments , anandan [ 15 ] proposed a general formula for the quantum phase shift based on a correspondence between the fringe shift and the classical special relativistic equations of motion .",
    "this remarkable general formula at once gives rise to all the above individual components .",
    "consider two de broglie wavelets originating at a and interfering at b , one traveling along adb and the other along acb , the plane adbc being fixed to earth and aligned vertically ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the vertical direction is determined by the resultant of gravity and the centrifugal force of earth . in the absence of any external forces , bd = bc and we take cd = @xmath9 , and ab = @xmath10 .",
    "the external field causes a shift in the position of b. let @xmath11 be the velocity of the classical particle and @xmath12 be the change in the tranverse velocity in the plane of interference .",
    "then , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the planar area ( assumed small ) enclosed by the two paths of interfering beams , @xmath16 is the neutron mass , @xmath17 is the momentum in flat space , and @xmath18 is the transverse component of acceleration in the vertical direction in the plane adbc .",
    "( we have made a slight change in the notation , that is , added a tilde for flat space quantities , in order to be consistent with our later equations . ) the formula ( 1 ) exhibits a general correspondence between the quantum phase shift and the classical equation of motion .",
    "the following cases were considered : ( i ) a particle with charge @xmath6 moving in a magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "then , @xmath20 , which , when used in eq.(1 ) , immediately yields the ab effect , viz . , @xmath21 ( ii ) a spinless particle of mass @xmath16 in a gravitational field , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth .",
    "using the expression for the relativistic momentum @xmath24 and the de broglie relation @xmath25 , one obtains from eq.(1 ) , the following result : @xmath26 the cow experiment was accurate enough to measure the first quantum term , but not the second , that is , the so called relativistic term . it may be mentioned here that the term @xmath27 could also be derived by an analysis involving the motion of neutrons along radial and cross radial directions [ 14 ] . however , the advantage of anandan s approach , which we adopt in this paper , is that it offers a simpler alternative and yet leads to more results than just this term , as we can see in this section .",
    "( iii ) a particle moving in the coriolis force field of earth so that , to first order in @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the component of earth s angular velocity @xmath31 normal to the apparatus . using the planck - einstein law @xmath32 , one finds from eq.(1 ) that @xmath33 the wsc experiment has tested this effect to within a good accuracy .",
    "( iv ) this effect comes from the coupling of particle s spin to the background curvature . again using ( 1 ) together with the mathisson - papapetrou force [ 23 ]",
    ", the shift comes out to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath36 is earth s mass and @xmath37 is the distance from the center .",
    "this effect is too tiny to be measurable at present and we do not discuss it here .",
    "with all the above in view , we proceed to familiarize the readers with the salient features of our approach in the next section .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to introduce the idea of an optical - mechanical analogy in general relativity [ 19 ] .",
    "the analogy provides an excellent tool that enables one to visualize the problems of geometrical optics as problems of classical mechanics and vice versa .",
    "the first step is to find out an optical refractive index @xmath38 that is formally equivalent to the geometrized gravity field .",
    "this step in itself is not new . in the study of optical propagation in a gravity field , this index has been used in the literature _ albeit _ in an approximate form .",
    "for instance , the index equivalent to the exterior schwarzschild field is usually taken to be @xmath39 , where @xmath36 is the central gravitating mass . in our approach , however , we consider the exact expression shown below .    consider a static , spherically symmetric , but not necessarily vacuum , solution of general relativity written in isotropic coordinates @xmath40 where @xmath41 or @xmath42 , and @xmath43 could be the solution of einstein s field equations .",
    "many metrics of physical interest can be put into this isotropic form .",
    "the coordinate speed of light @xmath44 is determined by the condition that the geodesic be null @xmath45 : @xmath46 which immediately provides an effective index of refraction for light in the gravitational field given by @xmath47 as the next step , we point out that the concept of the optical mechanical analogy can be used to recast the geodesic equation for _ both _ massive and massless particles into a single , exact newtonian ",
    "f = ma \" type of equation given by [ 19 ] @xmath48 where @xmath16 is the rest mass of the particle , @xmath49 is the conserved total energy , @xmath50 is the gradient operator .",
    "all the standard geodesic equations in schwarzschild gravity including some new insights in cosmology follow from the above equation [ 19 ] .",
    "this remarkably simple feature of the geodesic equations is brought about by the use of the stepping parameter @xmath51 , first introduced by evans and rosenquist [ 24 ] .",
    "( 9 ) provide an easy way to introduce quantum relations so that the geodesic motion of a particle can be interpreted as motion of de broglie matter waves in a dispersive medium with an effective index of refraction @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the compton wavelength given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the physical wavelength measured in a gravity field .",
    "this interpretation allows us to extend in a straightforward manner the classical optical - mechanical analogy into the quantum regime .",
    "alsing [ 25 ] has subsequently extended the method to broader class of metrics in general relativity and this work is going to provide the basic foundation of what follows .",
    "consider the most general form of the metric given by @xmath56 define the proper time @xmath57 , proper length @xmath58 and the velocity @xmath59 measured with respect to this proper time as @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 the @xmath64 and the proper velocity @xmath65 are vectors defined in the 3-space characterized by the metric @xmath66 , which is used to raise or lower the indices of these 3-vectors .",
    "now , the metric ( 10 ) can be rewritten as @xmath67 the conserved energy @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 the variational principle for the geodesics following from eq.(15 ) is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 henceforth , unless specifically restored , we take @xmath72 . from the lagrangian @xmath73 ,",
    "let us find the momenta conjugate to @xmath74 .",
    "this is given by @xmath75 since the vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined in a space with the metric @xmath66 , we can identify the right hand side of the eq.(19 ) as a vector in the same 3-space .",
    "let us call it the momentum 3-vector @xmath76 it can also be verified that @xmath77 , which is a constant along the trajectory of a particle as stated in eq.(16 ) .",
    "hence , it is possible to introduce maupertuis principle @xmath78 .",
    "assuming further that the spatial part of the metric could be written in an isotropic form @xmath79 , we get @xmath80 , and the maupertuis variational principle yields , after some manipulations introducing the parameter @xmath51 , the geodesic equation in the form @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "this newtonian form of the geodesic equation , valid for both massless and massive particles , has been obtained under the only assumption that the spatial part of the metric could be written in an isotropic form . on eliminating @xmath51 from eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) , we can find the rotational contributions to the well known schwarzschild orbits for light and planets [ 25 ] .",
    "equation similar to eq.(21 ) has actually been derived in the literature [ 26 ] , but only under the assumptions of small velocity and weak gravity . on the other hand ,",
    "the novelty of the above set of equations [ eq.(21 ) , ( 22 ) ] is that they are _ exact _ and that they hold for _ all velocities as well as in strong gravity fields_. the eq.(21 ) admits an immediate interpretation as describing the motion of a particle in a  potential \" @xmath84 and subjected to a  coriolis \" force @xmath85 , which would appear , for instance , in the absence of gravity @xmath86 in a coordinate system rotating with angular velocity @xmath87 .",
    "another advantage is that eq.(21 ) is expressed in terms of the velocity measured in proper time in a rotating field and this is exactly the velocity of the quantum particle measured by an observer comoving with the interferometer .",
    "our approach indicates that it is possible to simulate the quantum interference in earth s gravity as an experiment in a rotating medium described by @xmath38 and other quantities that take care of the nonlinearities . in order to find a general relativistic version of eq.(1 ) , we should express the relevant quantities in terms of their proper values , recalling that in a gravity field , one is able to measure only proper , and not coordinate , quantities .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath88 and @xmath89 do not vary appreciably over the dimensions of the apparatus ( a few square centimeters ) . from eq.(12 ) , we get @xmath90 and defining @xmath91 , we can write , using eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) , the transverse component of the proper acceleration as @xmath92 where @xmath93 . further , noting that @xmath94 , and introducing quantum relations , we have , from eqs.(20 ) and ( 16 ) , respectively , @xmath95\\left [ { \\frac{{v^2 } } { h } + \\frac{{2g_i v^i } } { { \\sqrt h } } + g_i g^i } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } }   = \\hbar \\kappa ,                  \\eqno(25)\\ ] ] @xmath96 reasoning along the lines similar to those in ref.[15 ] , and using eqs.(24 ) and ( 25 ) , we can write , under the assumption stated above , the general relativistic version of eq.(1 ) as @xmath97\\left ( { \\frac{{pa}}{{\\hbar v^2 } } } \\right ) = \\delta \\phi _ 1   + \\delta \\phi _ 2 ,         \\eqno(27)\\ ] ] in which @xmath98 is the radial component of acceleration . the rotational effects are represented by @xmath64 ( through @xmath99 ) , which occur in @xmath100 [ eq.(18 ) ] , @xmath101 [ eq.(25 ) ] and , of course , in the coriolis term @xmath102 . strictly speaking , even the area @xmath51 above",
    "would no longer be planar in the gravity field . but considering the miniscule dimension of the apparatus in a weak gravity field on the surface of the earth , we may disregard its departure from planarity in the practical computations .",
    "the equation ( 27 ) for the quantum fringe shift is the main proposition in our paper .    if one considers , as is done in ref.[15 ] , that gravity is given by the newtonian law @xmath103 in an otherwise flat space @xmath86 and that the rotational effects are contained exclusively in the classical coriolis term so that @xmath104 , then one has @xmath105\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{p}a}{\\hbar",
    "\\tilde{v}^2 } \\right ) ,                             \\eqno(28)\\ ] ] where @xmath106 one can see how beautifully the effects of gravity and rotation , usually considered as separate components in the literature [ cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) in sec.2 ] , are synthesized into a single equation .    in order to further explore the nature of eq.(21 ) , we note that sakurai [ 27 ] presented an interesting derivation of the phase shift induced by earth s rotation given by eq.(4 ) .",
    "it shows that the effect of coriolis force can be transcribed as an ab - type effect .",
    "this transcription finds a natural place in our approach .",
    "it was already stated in the previous section that eq.(21 ) exhibits a  coriolis \" type force .",
    "the equation can alternatively be regarded as a  lorentz \" force equation for the motion of a classical particle with charge to mass ratio @xmath107 in a static classical electromagnetic field . by scaling the stepping parameter @xmath51 to a variable having the dimension of time @xmath108 , and identifying the scalar potential @xmath109 and the vector potential @xmath110",
    ", we have from the four potential @xmath111 , the electric and magnetic fields as @xmath112 the last equation can be rewritten as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the rotational velocity of the earth with respect to distant stars [ see eq.(34 ) in the next section ] .",
    "now , it is well known that the ab phase difference in the interference region is proportional to the magnetic flux enclosed by the two paths as in fig.1 and is given by the line integral over the two routes : @xmath115 putting the value for @xmath116 in the above , we get @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the oriented area @xmath51 of the parallelogram adbc . using the planck - einstein law , we get just the expression ( 4 ) , but with the difference that our @xmath31 is completely determined by the metric 3-vector @xmath119 .",
    "it thus follows that the gravitational analog of the ab fringe shift is already embedded into the exact eq.(21 ) , thereby strengthening the weak field , low velocity analysis in ref .",
    "one may also regard the fringe shift due to the coriolis term as somewhat analogous to the quantized version of the sagnac effect without the particle mass term [ 15 ] .",

    "the interfering beams travel along paths adb and acb in a neutron interferometer .",
    "@xmath120 is the earth s",
    "angular velocity : @xmath121",
    "( a )    we shall first consider the kerr solution although , probably , it does not adequately represent any realistic rotating source due to quadrupole considerations .",
    "nonetheless , we can have an idea as to how the corrections appear in different terms .",
    "since the apparatus is situated on the surface of the earth , we can take the metric to lowest order in @xmath122 and fixing the apparatus on the equator ( @xmath123 , fig.1 ) , we have : @xmath124 ^ 2   - \\left ( { 1 + \\frac{{2m}}{r } } \\right)\\left [ { dr^2   + r^2 d\\varphi ^2 } \\right ] ,   \\eqno(32)\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the isotropic radial variable , @xmath126 is the earth s angular momentum .",
    "then one has the following expressions : @xmath127 @xmath128 assuming the velocity of the particle to be @xmath129 in the asymptotic region where @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 , and using the expression for @xmath68 [ eq.(16 ) ] , we find @xmath132 since , to first order , @xmath133 , we have , on earth s surface , @xmath134 here we encounter a situation that reminds us of the statements of cardall and fuller [ 28 ] : it is not possible to extract the pure gravitational field @xmath23 in the locally inertial frame ; there also appears a contribution @xmath135 in eq.(36 ) coming in from the asymptotic region .",
    "however , under the low velocity approximation , we can disregard this extra term for practical computations and take the usual newtonian equation ( 29 ) so that @xmath136    let us assess the terms , to lowest order , appearing in the second square bracket in eq.(25 ) .",
    "an analysis of the orbits of eq.(21 ) suggests that [ 25 ] , @xmath137 , so that we have @xmath138 @xmath139 \\cong 8\\left ( { 1 + \\frac{m}{r } } \\right)\\frac{{j^2 } } { { r^4 } } ,                      \\eqno(39)\\ ] ] @xmath140 therefore , to first order @xmath141 , the last two terms in the second square bracket in the expression for @xmath101 do not contribute , and hence , we may write , using eq.(37 ) : @xmath142 .",
    "together with the expression @xmath143 , and using the identity , @xmath144 , we get from eq.(27 ) , the effects of only static gravity in terms of @xmath89 : @xmath145 the rotational effect is then contained only in the coriolis term @xmath102 with @xmath31 determined by the metric coefficients .",
    "writing @xmath146 and using it in @xmath147 , we find that the term is modified also by the same factor @xmath148 using the approximate dispersion relation @xmath149 we get @xmath150 note that velocity dependent dispersion relations similar to eq.(43 ) , or more generally to the one following from the eqs.(25 ) and ( 26 ) , occur also in other works , although in different contexts [ 9,29 ] . with the expression for @xmath89 given in eq.(33 )",
    ", we easily see the first order corrections to respective special relativistic effects .",
    "the importance of the correction factors will be pointed out in the last section .",
    "( b )    low energy effective field theory describing heterotic string theory also produces rotating black hole solutions .",
    "a classical exact solution has been found by sen [ 20 ] which we refer to here as the kerr - sen solution .",

    "we have @xmath174 which indicates that the effect of the dilaton @xmath161 appears only in the order @xmath175 and its measurement appears to be beyond the present capabilities .",
    "our analysis above is primarily intended to fill a gap in the literature pointed out recently by zhang and beesham [ 14 ] .",
    "the proposed eq.(27 ) , together with inputs from eqs.(24)-(26 ) , constitute the desired unified , covariant version of the quantum fringe shift for thermal neutrons .",
    "generally , the equations exhibit both the effects of gravity and rotation in an inseparable manner . apart from this",
    ", the present work has a bearing on the ( weak ) principle of equivalence .",
    "if a viable theory of quantum gravity has to be formulated , the validity of this principle must be tested even at a quantum mechanical level .",
    "anandan [ 15 ] suggested a method which involves carrying out the experiment with the interferometer at a distance @xmath125 from the axis of rotation of a turntable .",
    "if the principle is valid quantum mechanically , one should obtain the phase shift eq.(3 ) with @xmath176 . on the other hand from the classical point of view",
    ", it is well known that the principle is embedded in einstein s theory of general relativity in the form of geodesic equations which follow from the bianchi identities .",
    "hence , a natural question arises if we can write the geodesic equation in a form that at once reveals the effect of gravity and rotation on the quantum fringe shift while , at the same time , leads to corresponding special relativistic results in the limit .",
    "our analysis above shows that it is indeed possible and a unified expression for the general relativistic quantum fringe shift was proposed .",
    "thus , a test of the principle in the quantum regime involves looking for general relativistic correction terms in an interferometric experiment .",
    "it does no longer seem necessary to regard the equivalence principle as a mere equality of newtonian forces , viz . ,",
    "@xmath176 , since general relativity encapsules something more in its nonlinearities than just this . as an aside , an interesting analogy between the coriolis and the ab effect has been pointed out .",
    "we considered two examples , one from general relativity and the other from string theory . with an eye to practical feasibilities ,",
    "we had worked out only the first order corrections , viz . , @xmath177 and @xmath178 to the respective special relativistic terms measured in the cow or wsc - type experiments . in this approximation",
    ", one has to be content with the metric rotational contribution being represented only by the angular velocity part @xmath179 .",
    "this is a bit unfortunate but seems inescapable .",
    "the corrections are quite consistent from an intuitive point of view as well , although they arose here from a reasonably exact equation ( 27 ) . since , on the surface of the earth , @xmath180 , measurements of these corrections in an earth bound configuration require a sensitivity at least of the order of @xmath181 times more than what the present setup offers [ 32 ] .",
    "the string contributions appear only in the second order in the form @xmath182 and multiplying it with special relativistic terms , one obtains extremely tiny corrections that look fairly out of question at present [ 30 ] .    as a final comment",
    ", we wish to point out that the validity of the principle of equivalence for _ charged _ particles still appears to be a debatable issue [ 33 ] . at a fundamental level",
    ", the issue relates to the question as to how the ( radiation ) energy is to be defined : is it a conserved quantity associated with lorentz boosts in minkowski space [ 34 ] or with the killing symmetry of time translations [ 33 ] ?",
    "the resolution of this question has a deep relevance to whether the breakdown of lorentz invariance could be interpreted as a violation of the principle of equivalence , although an affirmative interpretation is commonly adopted in the literature [ 9,35 ] .",
