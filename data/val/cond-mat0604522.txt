    "in general , the magnitude of the measured response of a system to an external perturbation decreases as the size of the system decreases , and therefore conventional probes based on the measurement of linear response often become impractical for the study of nanosystems",
    ". however , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite guarantees that the linear response of a system can also be determined from the spectrum of the system s internal fluctuations while in equilibrium . to probe the intrinsic fluctuations of a system one can use any of a variety of so - called ` noise spectroscopies ' , which typically disturb the system much less as compared with measurements based on intentional perturbation of the system  @xcite",
    "further , fluctuation signals generally offer more advantageous scaling with size as the system size is reduced  @xcite .",
    "recently , we utilized a noise spectroscopy based on ultrasensitive magneto - optical faraday rotation applied to classical gases of alkali atoms  @xcite with an aim to measure the spectrum of intrinsic spin ( magnetization ) fluctuations in an atomic ensemble . in this experiment a linearly polarized laser , detuned from one of the fundamental _ s - p _ (",
    "d1 or d2 ) optical transitions of the alkali atom , was transmitted through the alkali vapor ( which itself was in thermal equilibrium ) . to leading order , the laser detuning was sufficiently large to ensure no absorption of the laser by the atoms , and so the laser was primarily sensitive to the dispersive ( real ) part of the atomic dielectric function through the vapor s spin - sensitive index of refraction  @xcite .",
    "stochastic spin fluctuations in the alkali ensemble therefore imparted small fluctuations in the polarization rotation ( faraday rotation ) angle of the transmitted laser .",
    "these faraday rotation angle fluctuations , measured as a function of time , exhibited power spectra showing clear noise resonances at frequencies corresponding to the differences between the various hyperfine / zeeman atomic levels of the alkali atom . the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite were performed at relatively high temperatures , where the alkali atoms behave as a classical boltzmann gas and interatomic interactions are unimportant .",
    "in addition , these experiments were conducted in the low magnetic field regime where zeeman energies were much less than the typical hyperfine splittings of the atomic ground state . from the spin noise",
    "spectra alone and with the atomic ensemble remaining in thermal equilibrium , a determination of the atomic g - factors , nuclear spin , isotope abundance ratios , hyperfine splittings , nuclear moments and spin coherence lifetimes was possible .",
    "these properties of classical alkali atoms are , of course , already well known  @xcite ; the experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite established the practical value of spin noise spectroscopy for determining the properties of atomic gases and the magnitude of spin noise signals expected under various experimental conditions .",
    "we have also recently suggested  @xcite that this type of spin noise spectroscopy is a promising experimental probe for ultracold alkali atomic gases because : i )  it is only weakly perturbing and , ii )  based on the classical alkali gas measurements , large noise signals are expected .",
    "ultracold gases of alkali atoms  @xcite provide experimentally accessible model systems for probing quantum states that manifest themselves at the macroscopic scale . because the temperature is very low ,",
    "interactions between the alkali atoms are important , and novel many - body quantum states arise because of these interactions . the ability to vary the effective interatomic interaction ( by varying an external magnetic field and thus adjusting the relative strength of the hyperfine and zeeman interactions ) makes ultracold atom gases especially interesting model systems for a wide range of quantum many - body systems .",
    "the properties of ultracold gases of alkali atoms are of great interest and are just beginning to be understood .",
    "new experimental probes of these systems aimed at revealing the underlying interatomic interactions will be very useful .",
    "faraday rotation in alkali gases is sensitive to the projection of the atom s electron spin in the direction of laser propagation @xcite . in general , projections of electron spin alone are not good quantum numbers of the alkali atom hamiltonian . at low magnetic fields where the zeeman energies are smaller than or comparable to the hyperfine interaction , the electron and nuclear spins are entangled and",
    "no projection of electron spin is a good quantum number . at strong magnetic fields where the zeeman splitting is much larger than the hyperfine splitting ,",
    "the electron spin projection in the direction of the magnetic field becomes a good quantum number , but electron spin projection orthogonal to the magnetic field is not .",
    "thus , noise spectroscopy at low temperature can be performed with the magnetic field either parallel or orthogonal to the direction of laser propagation whereas in the high - field limit , the magnetic field should be orthogonal to the direction of laser propagation .    in this paper , we derive a general expression for the spin noise power spectrum in alkali gases as measured by optical faraday rotation and show that the noise power spectrum is determined by an electron spin - spin correlation function .",
    "this general expression applies to both classical gases at high temperature as well as ultracold quantum gases .",
    "we make detailed calculations of the expected noise spectra for a classical gas of @xmath0k atoms and compare these calculated results with quantitative measurements of the spin noise power .",
    "we find good agreement between the calculated and measured results in both the low- and high - magnetic field limit .",
    "isotopically enriched alkali vapors of @xmath0k were chosen because the relatively small hyperfine splitting of this atom ( @xmath1254 mhz ) allows to approach the high - field limit rather easily ( magnetic fields of order 100 gauss ) .",
