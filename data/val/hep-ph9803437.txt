    "the phojet event generator is a monte carlo implementation of the two - component dual parton model .",
    "this model combines results obtained within regge theory , gribov s reggeon calculus @xcite and abramowski - gribov - kancheli ( agk ) cutting rules @xcite with perturbative qcd predictions for hard interaction processes ( see for example @xcite , a review is given in @xcite ) .",
    "the dual parton model describes high - mass diffractive hadron production in terms of enhanced graphs like the triple - pomeron graph @xcite . as already discussed in @xcite , within this approach , diffractive processes can be considered as collisions of a color neutral object , the pomeron , with hadrons , photons or other pomerons .",
    "however , it is important to note that the pomeron can not be considered as an ordinary hadron .",
    "it is only a theoretical object providing an effective description of the important degrees of freedom of a certain sum of feynman diagrams in regge limit ( e.g.the available c.m .",
    "energy is large compared to the momentum transfer characterizing the scattering process ) . in this sense",
    ", pomeron - hadron or pomeron - pomeron interactions can only be discussed in the framework of collisions of other particles like hadrons or photons .",
    "experimental data support the interpretation of diffractive particle production in terms of pomeron - hadron or pomeron - pomeron collisions .",
    "it was found that high - mass diffraction dissociation exhibits similar features as non - diffractive hadron production where the mass of the diffractively produced system corresponds to the collision energy in non - diffractive interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that , in order to obtain a reasonable monte carlo description of non - diffractive hadron production , multiple partonic interactions between projectile and target are needed at high energies @xcite . given the striking similarities between diffractive and non - diffractive multiparticle production one may expect that multiple soft as well as hard interactions may also play an important role in pomeron - hadron / photon / pomeron interactions .",
    "another consequence of the triple - pomeron graph interpretation is an energy - dependent normalization of the pomeron flux .",
    "experimentally , the pomeron flux in target diffraction dissociation is given by the cross section for rapidity gap events divided by the corresponding pomeron - target cross section .",
    "however , since at high energies additional projectile - target interactions are likely to fill the rapidity gap with hadrons , the experimentally observable pomeron flux is smaller than the flux implied by the triple - pomeron graph .",
    "furthermore , it may depend not only on projectile but also on target properties",
    ".    however , in the case of a large rapidity gap between the jets in two - jet events , as observed at tevatron @xcite , at least one pomeron has a large virtuality and standard regge phenomenology can not be applied .",
    "therefore , one has to introduce a new kind of process like soft color reconnection ( scr ) @xcite or perturbative gluon - ladder exchange @xcite .",
    "the phojet monte carlo is a first attempt to built a model which accounts for both effects , multiple soft and hard interactions between the constituents of the projectile and target as well as multiple interactions in the pomeron - projectile , pomeron - target , and pomeron - pomeron scattering subprocesses .",
    "the model includes also scr in hard scattering processes similar to @xcite .",
    "the realization of the dpm in phojet @xcite with a hard and a soft component is similar to the event generator dtujet @xcite for @xmath0@xmath0 and @xmath3@xmath0 collisions",
    ". interactions of hadrons are described in terms of reggeon ( @xmath4 ) and pomeron ( @xmath5 ) exchanges . the pomeron exchange is artificially subdivided into _ soft _ processes and processes with at least one large momentum transfer ( _ hard _ processes ) .",
    "this allows us to use the predictive power of the qcd - improved parton model with lowest - order qcd matrix elements @xcite and parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "practically , soft and hard processes are distinguished by applying a transverse momentum cutoff @xmath6 of about 3 gev/@xmath7 to the scattered partons .",
    "the pomeron is considered as a two - component object with the born graph cross section for pomeron exchange given by the sum of hard and soft cross sections .",
    "high - mass diffraction dissociation is described in the following way . in order to get an efficient parametrization of born graph cross sections describing diffraction within gribov s reggeon calculus",

    "we have to consider , in addition to the shadowing contribution from multiple pomeron exchange between projectile and target , also rescattering effects in pomeron - hadron and pomeron - pomeron interactions . for the cross section calculation",
    "the introduction of a renormalized pomeron trajectory takes this effect into account .",

    "we get a color reconnection caused by the exchange of soft gluons , now the color strings connect the hard scattered quark and the diquark of the same hadron , these are events with a rapidity gap .    the simplest hard g  g event where scr leads to a rapidity gap between two jets is an event with just one hard g  g scattering . in normal events we get again two color strings connecting the ( soft ) valence quark of one hadron via the hard scattered gluon to the ( soft ) diquark of the other hadron . in events with scr",

    "such events might have a rapidity gap .    in most events we have multiple soft and hard interactions ,",
    "even if a rapidity gap appears in one of the multiple collisions , the gap might be filled by hadrons resulting from the other collisions .",

    "nevertheless the rise of the cross section from isr energies to the energies of the cern and fermilab colliders is less steep than expected from the born level expression which is the triple pomeron formula .",
    "however , within our model a renormalized pomeron flux as proposed in @xcite is not needed .",
    "there are two reasons this :    \\(i ) the eikonal unitarization procedure in the model suppresses the rapidity gap survival probability .",
    "this effect is well known ( see for example @xcite ) and can be tested directly comparing diffraction dissociation in deep inelastic scattering and photoproduction at hera @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the graph for double - pomeron scattering has cuts which correspond to single diffraction dissociation .",

    "therefore , again we expect the main differences in comparison to other channels in the hard component due to the differences between the pomeron and hadron structure functions and due to the existence or nonexistence of a direct pomeron  quark coupling .",
