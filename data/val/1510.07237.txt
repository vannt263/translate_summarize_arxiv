    "a field theory has to posses both renormalizability and unitarity to be a well - defined quantum theory . these properties , which may be intimately related to each other ,",
    "are believed to provide identical constraints on consistent interactions .",
    "this idea motivated the study of the equivalence between the renormalizability and the tree - level unitarity in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a similar equivalence also holds for gravity theories @xcite and no counter - example is known in relativistic field theories .",
    "it is worth checking whether the equivalence holds true for more generic field theories , such as non - relativistic theories .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the equivalence between renormalizability and unitarity in lifshitz - type theories @xcite , which are characterized by the lifshitz scaling @xmath6 due to this anisotropic scaling property , lifshitz - type theories have improved ultraviolet ( uv ) behaviors but lack the lorentz symmetry .",
    "lifshitz - type theories have gotten a lot of attention in cosmology @xcite and some their quantum properties are also investigated @xcite . moreover , by introducing the idea of the lifshitz scaling to gravity theory , hoava has constructed a power - counting renormalizable gravity theory , which is called the hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite .",
    "the application of the hl gravity is widely studied in cosmology ( see @xcite for a review ) , such as the emergence of the dark matter as an integration constant @xcite and so on .",
    "in contrast , the quantum properties , such as unitarity and renormalizability , of hl gravity still remain uncertain .    in this paper , we study the quantum aspects of the lifshitz scalar field theory , which can be viewed as a toy model of the hl gravity .",
    "the lack of the lorentz symmetry gives rise to significant modifications to both renormalizability and unitarity .",
    "we show that due to the modification of the scaling dimensions of fields , an extended version of the power counting argument is necessary for renormalizability . as for tree - level unitarity ,",
    "the reference frame dependence of scattering amplitudes gives rise to new modified constraints , which can be stronger than those derived only from the high energy center - of - mass ( com ) scattering amplitudes .",
    "we derive the extended power - counting - renomalizability ( prc ) conditions and the tree - level unitarity constraints on self - interactions of a single lifshitz scalar field .",
