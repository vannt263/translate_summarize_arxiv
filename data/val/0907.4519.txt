    "recently , in the context of the jet - quenching phenomena @xcite , exciting jet - associated particle correlations @xcite have been observed in heavy - ion collisions at bnl s relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "this indicates the formation of shock waves in form of mach cones @xcite induced by supersonic partons moving through the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and could give a direct access to the equation of state of the qgp .",
    "shock waves can be observed if the matter , where the shock waves are induced , behaves like a fluid .",
    "the large measured elliptic flow coefficient @xmath2 @xcite implies that the qgp created at rhic could be a nearly perfect fluid with a small viscosity .",
    "calculations of viscous hydrodynamics @xcite and microscopic transport theory @xcite have estimated the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio @xmath0 to be less than 0.4 .",
    "still , it is not known , if this upper limit of the @xmath0 ratio is sufficiently small to allow the formation of relativistic shock waves .    in this work",
    "we address the question , whether and when relativistic shock waves can develop in viscous gluon matter for given @xmath0 values . for this purpose",
    "we consider the relativistic riemann problem .",
    "its initial conditions are two regions of equilibrated matter with different constant pressure separated by a membrane which is removed at @xmath3 .",
    "the matter evolves in form of a one - dimensional expansion .",
    "we solve the relativistic riemann problem employing both the parton cascade bamps ( boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ) @xcite and the vshasta approach ( viscous sharp and smooth transport algorithm ) @xcite of viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "we demonstrate the transition from ideal shock waves to free diffusion by varying the @xmath0 ratio from zero to infinity .",
    "we estimate the upper limit of the @xmath0 value , for which shocks can still be observed experimentally on the time scale typical at rhic .",
    "bamps is a microscopic transport model solving the boltzmann equation @xmath4 for on - shell gluons with the collision integral @xmath5 .",
    "the algorithm for collisions is based on the stochastic interpretation of the transition rate @xcite . in this study",
    ", we consider only binary gluon scattering processes with an isotropic cross section , which is adjusted locally at each time step to keep a constant @xmath0 value @xcite .",
    "vshasta solves the israel - stewart ( is ) equations of dissipative hydrodynamics . in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "is equations reduce to @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for vanishing shear viscous pressure , @xmath9 , eqs .",
    "( [ cons_e ] ) and ( [ cons_m ] ) reduce to the equations of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] shows the solution of the relativistic riemann problem for various @xmath0 values as computed with bamps .    , the pressure is @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the left panel shows the pressure and the right panel the velocity at time @xmath14 fm / c .",
    ", width=491 ]    the results demonstrate a gradual transition from ideal hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath15 ) to free streaming of particles ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the ideal solution @xcite is reproduced with a very good precision for @xmath17 .",
    "we see that a shock wave is traveling into matter with lower pressure ( on the right ) with a velocity @xmath18 larger than the velocity of sound @xmath19 .",
    "the region behind the shock front is the so - called shock plateau , where matter is equilibrated and moves collectively with @xmath20 , shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "simultaneously a rarefaction wave is propagating with @xmath19 into matter of higher pressure ( on the left ) .    a larger @xmath0 value results in a finite transition layer where the quantities change smoothly rather than discontinuously as in the case of a perfect fluid .",
    "furthermore a non - zero viscosity , if large enough , impedes the formation of a shock plateau and a clear separation of the shock front from the rarefaction fan .    .",
    "results are obtained using bamps and vshasta.,width=491 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] we compare the results from bamps and vshasta for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we see a perfect agreement for @xmath21 , whereas for larger value of @xmath23 small deviations in the region of the shock front and rarefaction wave are found .",
    "the reason for the difference is that in these regions the local knudsen number @xmath24 @xcite is large and thus the applicability of is equations is questionable .",
    "transport calculations do not suffer from that drawback .",
    "results are obtained using bamps for @xmath25.,width=491 ]    the formation of a shock wave takes a certain amount of time , as demonstrated in fig .  [ fig02 ] for @xmath25 . at early times",
    "a shock has not yet developed , the profile looks like a free streaming of particles .",
    "but at later times we observe the creation of a shock plateau .",
    "formally we define the time of formation of the shock plateau when the maximum of the velocity distribution @xmath26 reaches the value @xmath20 of the ideal - fluid solution in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , we see that this happens at @xmath14 fm / c .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have found the scaling behavior of the riemann problem : the time scale of the formation of shock waves @xmath27 is proportional to the @xmath0 ratio . from fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] we also infer that , for @xmath28 , a shock plateau has not yet developed at @xmath14 fm / c , whereas for @xmath29 , it has already fully formed .",
    "for @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 fm / c , which is the typical lifetime of the qgp produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "therefore , an imperfect quark gluon fluid with @xmath30 will prevent the observation of mach cone signals at rhic .",
    "using the parton cascade bamps we have solved the relativistic riemann problem .",
    "the transition from ideal - fluid behavior to free streaming is demonstrated .",
    "numerical results from bamps agree well with those obtained from viscous hydrodynamical calculations using vshasta .",
    "considering the scaling behavior we found that the formation of shock waves in gluon matter with @xmath30 probably takes longer than the lifetime of the qgp at rhic .",
