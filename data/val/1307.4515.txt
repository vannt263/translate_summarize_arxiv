    "ordinary matter and antimatter asymmetry is a fundamental problem in modern physics research . since c. d. anderson discovered the first antiparticle , i.e. positron , inside the cosmic rays in 1932 , then the anti - neutrons , anti - protons and other anti - particles and light ( anti)nuclei have gradually been discovered in scientific experiments  @xcite . it is believed that there exists equal amount of ordinary matter and antimatter in the initial stages of the universe .",
    "especially , after the discovery of the first hypernuclei in 1952  @xcite , searching for ( anti)hypernuclei bound states and exploring the hyperon - nucleon interaction have been steadily fascinating the sights of nuclear physicists  @xcite . because an anti - nucleus is very unstable and its yield is very low , so the progress of antimatter research was slow . in the high energy collision experiments ,",
    "the high temperature and high baryon density matter is similar to the `` fireball '' environment produced in the initial stages of the big bang , which is uniquely suitable for the production of both the light ( anti)nuclei and ( anti)hypernuclei mentioned above .",
    "the star collaboration has reported their measurements of @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 in au+au collisions at the top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "the alice collaboration has also published their preliminary @xmath5 yield of @xmath12 measured in the pp collisions at @xmath13  tev  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical study of light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) is usually divided into two steps .",
    "firstly the nucleons and hyperons are calculated with some selected models , such as the transport models . then the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei )",
    "are calculated by the phase space coalescence model  @xcite and/or the statistical model  @xcite etc .",
    "recently , the production of light nuclei ( hypernuclei ) in the au+au / pb+pb collisions at relativistic energies has been investigated theoretically by the coalescence+blast - wave method  @xcite and the urqmd - hydro hybrid model+thermal model  @xcite , respectively .    besides",
    ", we have proposed an approach , paciae + the dynamically constrained phase - space coalescence model ( dcpc model )  @xcite .",
    "dcpc is based on the final hadronic state generated by a parton and hadron cascade model paciae  @xcite .",
    "we have first predict the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) yield , transverse momentum distribution , and the rapidity distribution in non - single diffractive pp collisions at @xmath14  tev  @xcite .",
    "then we use this method to investigate the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) and hypernuclei ( anti - hypernuclei ) productions for in 0 - 5% most central au+au collisions at @xmath1  gev  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the results of light ( anti)nuclei and ( anti)hypernuclei yields and their ratios given by different experimental groups employed event samples with different centralities .",
    "for example , the star analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite used a data sample of 25 million central triggered events ( 0 - 12% centrality ) plus 24 million minimum - bias triggered events ( 0 - 80% centrality ) . for star in ref .",
    "@xcite , about 89 million collision events were collected using minimum - bias events , and an additional 22 million events were collected using near - zero impact parameter collisions .",
    "the data set for phenix analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite includes @xmath15 minimum bias events . in theoretical studies , the production of light ( anti)nuclei and ( anti)hypernuclei is usually investigated in most central heavy ion collisions events ( 0 - 5% centrality )  @xcite .",
    "however , in previous theoretical and experimental studies , little attention has been paid to the impact of the centrality on the production for light ( anti)nuclei and ( anti)hypernuclei in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in fact , the centrality in heavy ion collisions may have a great impact on the yields of light ( anti)nuclei . in order to effectively compare the experimental and theoretical results for different collision centralities ,",
    "it is necessary to study the dependence of light ( anti)nuclei and ( anti)hypernuclei yields as well as their ratios on the centrality in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the paciae model and the dynamically constrained phase - space coalescence model ( dcpc model ) . in sec .",
    "iii , the numerical results of light ( anti)nuclei and ( anti)hypernuclei yields and their ratios are given in different centrality bins , and are compared with the star and phenix data .",
    "a short summary is the content of sec .",
    "the pythia model ( pythia 6.4  @xcite ) is devised for the high energy hadron - hadron ( @xmath16 ) collisions . in this model",
    ", a hh collision is decomposed into parton - parton collisions .",
    "the hard parton - parton scattering is described by the leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) parton - parton interactions with a modification of parton distribution function in a hadron . for the soft parton - parton collision ,",
    "a non - perturbative process is considered empirically .",
    "the initial- and final - state qcd radiations and the multiparton interactions are also taken into account .",
    "therefore , the consequence of a hh collision is a partonic multijet state composed of di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) , quarks ( antiquarks ) and gluons , as well as a few hadronic remnants .",
    "this is then followed by the string construction and fragmentation .",
    "a hadronic final state is obtained for a hh collision eventually .",
    "the parton and hadron cascade model paciae  @xcite is based on pythia 6.4 and is devised mainly for the nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the paciae model ,",
    "firstly , the nucleus - nucleus collision is decomposed into the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions according to the collision geometry and nn total cross section .",
    "each nn collision is described by the pythia model with the string fragmentation switches - off and di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) randomly breaks into quarks ( anti - quarks ) .",
    "so the consequence of a nn collision is a partonic initial state composed of quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons .",
    "provided all nn collisions are exhausted , one obtains a partonic initial state for a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "this partonic initial state is regarded as the quark - gluon matter ( qgm ) formed in the relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "secondly , the parton rescattering proceeds .",
    "the rescattering among partons in qgm is randomly considered by the 2@xmath17 2 lo - pqcd parton - parton cross sections  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a @xmath18 factor is introduced here to account for higher order and non - perturbative corrections .",
    "thirdly , the hadronization happens after the parton rescattering .",
    "the partonic matter can be hadronized by the lund string fragmentation regime  @xcite and/or the phenomenological coalescence model  @xcite .",
    "finally , the hadronic matter proceeds rescattering until the hadronic freeze - out ( the exhaustion of the hadron - hadron collision pairs ) .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for the details .    in quantum statistical mechanics  @xcite one",
    "can not precisely define both position @xmath19 and momentum @xmath20 of a particle in the six dimension phase space , because of the uncertainty principle @xmath21 we can only say that this particle lies somewhere within a six dimension quantum `` box '' or `` state '' with a volume of @xmath22 .",
    "a particle state occupies a volume of @xmath23 in the six dimension phase space  @xcite . therefore one can estimate the yield of a single particle by defining the following integral    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the hamiltonian and energy of the particle , respectively .",
    "similarly , the yield of n particle cluster can be estimated as following integral @xmath27    therefore the yield of @xmath9 in the dynamically constrained phase space coalescence model , for instance , is assumed to be @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30^{1/2 } , \\label{yield2}\\ ] ] and ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath32 ) are the energies and momenta of particles @xmath33 , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ yield1 ] ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for , respectively , the rest mass and diameter of @xmath9 , @xmath36 refers to the allowed mass uncertainty , and @xmath37 is the vector distance between particle @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    as the hadron position and momentum distributions from transport model simulations are discrete , the integral over continuous distributions in eq .",
    "( [ yield ] ) should be replaced by the sum over discrete distributions . in a single event of the final hadronic state obtained from transport model simulation , the configuration of @xmath9 ( @xmath40+@xmath41+@xmath42 ) system , for instance , can be expressed as @xmath43 where the subscripts @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 refers to the distance between particle @xmath38 and center - of - mass of three particles , ie .",
    "@xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the coordinate vector of the center - of - mass of @xmath40 , @xmath50 , and @xmath42 .",
    "therefore the third constraint ( diameter constraint ) in eq .",
    "( [ yield1 ] ) is correspondingly replaced by @xmath51 where @xmath52 refers to the radius of @xmath9 .",
    "each of the above configurations contributes a partial yield of @xmath53 to the yield of @xmath9 .",
    "so the total yield of @xmath9 in a single event is the sum of the above partial yield over the configuration in eq .",
    "( [ conf ] ) and their combinations .",
    "an average yield for all the events is required at the end .",
    "firstly we produce the final state particles using the paciae model . in the paciae simulations we assume that hyperons heavier than @xmath54 decay already .",
    "the model parameters are fixed on the default values given in pythia  @xcite .",
    "however , the k factor as well as the parameters parj(1 ) , parj(2 ) , and parj(3 ) , relevant to the strange production in pythia  @xcite , are given by fitting the star data of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in au+au collisions at @xmath58  gev  @xcite .",
    "the fitted parameters of @xmath18=3 ( default value is 1 or 1.5  @xcite ) , parj(1)=0.12 ( 0.1 ) , parj(2)=0.55 ( 0.3 ) , and parj(3)=0.65 ( 0.4 ) are used to generate @xmath0 events ( final hadronic states ) by the paciae model .",
