    "self - consistent quantization of gravitation is usually considered as a high - energy problem .",
    "there is a number of models of quantum gravity none of which has succeeded in reconciliation of renormalizability with basic principles of the scattering theory , such as unitarity and causality .",
    "it is important , however , that the low - energy properties of quantum gravity are universal whatever the ultimate theory , in that they are determined solely by the lowest order einstein theory .",
    "investigation of the low - energy limit allows one to draw important conclusions about the synthesis of quantum theory and gravitation .",
    "one of the main principles underlying einstein s general relativity is the principle of general covariance .",
    "it states that arbitrary coordinate transformations must leave the form of dynamical equations unchanged .",
    "since quantum theory deals with fields rather than coordinate transformations , another formulation of this principle is appropriate for the purposes of quantization : dynamical equations must be invariant under arbitrary spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "this formulation reveals general relativity as a gauge theory . from this point of view , any specific choice of coordinate system , or more precisely , of reference frame , is equivalent to imposition of an appropriate set of gauge conditions on the metric field , a change in the gauge conditions being equivalent to a spacetime diffeomorphism .    in classical theory , there is no difference between the two points of view .",
    "general covariance of the theory implies that it is diffeomorphism - invariant , and vice versa .",
    "an important difference appears , however , in quantum theory . while the notion of reference frame retains its essentially classical content , components of the metric are promoted into operators , and so are generators of the gauge transformations .",
    "furthermore , the gauge conditions become operator relations . used in the classical theory as a means for defining reference frames and their transformations , these notions thus loose their direct interpretation in quantum domain . in this respect , a natural question arises about relevant interpretation of the above - mentioned operator relations , and their role in defining reference frames in quantum gravity .    in connection with the above statement of the problem",
    "the following circumstance should be emphasized .",
    "it is widely believed that the characteristic length scale where quantum gravity effects come into play is given by the planck length @xmath2 the quantum gravitational corrections to the classical laws are thus expected to be of the relative order @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic length of the problem under consideration . since these corrections reflect quantum properties of the spacetime itself , one might doubt relevance of the notion of coordinate system in the classical sense outlined above .",
    "one should note , however , that this reasoning is based on the assumption that the planck length is the _ only _ scale of quantum gravitational effects . as far as pure gravity is considered , this assumption is certainly true since @xmath5 is the only dimensional constant entering the einstein action @xmath6 in the presence of a matter field , however , another length scale appears  the gravitational radius @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the field quanta . as a matter of fact , along with terms proportional to @xmath9 the radiative gravitational corrections also contain terms independent of the planck constant @xcite .",
    "thus , the question whether the quantum gravity effects appear already at the order @xmath10 or not , is the question of _ correspondence _ between classical and quantum theories .",
    "the problem of establishing the correct correspondence in quantum gravity was considered in detail in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that the approach using the s - matrix potential is inadequate for this purpose , and the correct correspondence between classical and quantum theories is to be established in terms of the effective ( mean ) fields , rather than the s - matrix .",
    "this suggestion is underlined by an observation that the @xmath11-loop radiative contribution to the @xmath11th post - newtonian correction to the mean gravitational field of a body with mass @xmath12 consisting of @xmath13 elementary particles with mass @xmath14 contains an extra factor of @xmath15 in comparison with the corresponding tree contribution .",
    "thus , the effective gravitational field produced by the body turns into the classical solution of the einstein equations in the limit @xmath16 ( and therefore , @xmath17 ) .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the s - matrix gravitational potential becomes newtonian in the same limit , hence , it fails to describe whatever non - newtonian interactions of _ macroscopic _ bodies .",
    "an immediate consequence of this interpretation is that in the case of _ finite _ @xmath18 the loop corrections of the order @xmath19 describe deviations of the spacetime metric from classical solutions of the einstein equations , implying that ( [ rgscale ] ) is the true scale of quantum gravity effects as @xmath20    we can now reformulate the initial problem more precisely as follows . on the one hand , the @xmath19 radiative corrections are of the same functional form as the post - newtonian corrections predicted by classical general relativity , and therefore must be treated on an equal footing with the latter . on the other hand ,",
    "their transformation under transitions between different gauge conditions is expected to be more complicated .",
    "the question is what the law of this transformation and its physical interpretation are .",
    "this is actually the question of _ general covariance in quantum gravity .",
    "_    the aim of the present paper is to investigate this problem at the first post - newtonian approximation .",

    "the results obtained in the preceding sections answer the general questions stated in the introduction .",
    "first of all , they establish general transformation properties of observable quantities under deformations of a reference frame , induced by variations of the gauge conditions .",
    "specifically , it was shown in sec .",
    "[ oneloop ] that although variations of the weighting matrix lead to non - zero variations of the effective fields , the latter transform in such a way that the observable quantities remain unchanged .",
    "thus , the seemingly wider freedom in the choice of gauge conditions at the quantum level introduces no ambiguity into the values of the physical quantities . in this sense",
    ", one can say that the physical properties of a given reference frame are determined essentially by the form of the functions @xmath43 only , just like in the classical theory .    unlike the classical general relativity , however , observations of a physical quantity in two reference frames defined by different sets of functions @xmath43 give generally different results .",
    "for instance , spacetime curvature observed in a fixed reference point @xmath256 varies according to eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) under deformations of the reference frame , induced by variations of the parameter @xmath203 entering the gauge conditions ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "the loop contributions thus violate general covariance , depriving thereby the notion of spacetime curvature of its absolute meaning , which is recovered only in the macroscopic limit @xmath257 where @xmath1 is the number of elementary particles producing the given gravitational field .",
    "let us now discuss this issue from the practical point of view . as was mentioned in the introduction , from the point of view of formal power expansion in @xmath9 the characteristic length scale of quantum gravity effects",
    "is the same as in the classical einstein theory .",
    "informally , the actual value of this scale depends on the physical properties of a system under consideration . for fundamental elementary particle such as the electron",
    ", @xmath258 is even smaller than the planck length . for the stars @xmath258",
    "is measured by kilometers , but the quantum contribution is highly suppressed in this case ; in comparison with the classical ( tree ) contribution , the loop contribution to the first post - newtonian correction to the field of a gravitating body contains the extra factor @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of constituent particles . for the solar gravitational field , for instance , this factor is of the order @xmath259 however , this suppression is only in force as long as interactions of the particles are relatively small .",
    "this differs in a situation when the evolution of a system of particles ends up with formation of the horizon . in this case ,",
    "interaction of particles in no way can be considered small . from the point of view of an external observer , the number @xmath1 is now irrelevant to the gravitational field of the collapsar ( this is a consequence of the `` no hair '' theorem ) .",
    "made by the infinite gravitational force indivisible , this object can be considered as a `` particle '' , _",
    "@xmath1 is to be set unity .",
    "as is well known , black holes of certain types do behave like normal elementary particles @xcite . on the other hand , it should be emphasized that from the point of view of the low - energy theory we work with , the exact structure of the microscopic theory in which black hole is embedded is of no importance .",
    "it is only important whether or not this object can be described by a single quantum field .",
    "the loop contributions to the gravitational field of black hole are thus of the same order of magnitude as the ordinary post - newtonian corrections predicted by classical general relativity .",
    "calculation of the actual value of the one - loop contribution to the effective gravitational field of black holes can be found in ref .",
    "let us note in this connection that not only the static gravitational field of black holes , but also emission of the gravitational waves by the black hole binaries must be affected by the quantum contributions .",
    "the ligo and virgo @xcite gravitational wave detectors , which are currently under construction , will hopefully bring light into this issue .                c.  becchi ,  a.  rouet , and  r.  stora , ann . of phys .",
