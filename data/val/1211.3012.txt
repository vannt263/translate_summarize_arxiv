    "general relativity ( gr ) has changed our understanding of spacetime . in parallel ,",
    "the appearance of quantum field theory ( qft ) has modified our view of particles , fields and the measurement process .",
    "the usual approach for the unification of qft and gr , to a quantum gravity , starts with a proposal to quantize gr and its underlying structure , spacetime .",
    "there is an unique opinion in the community about the relation between geometry and quantum theory : the geometry as used in gr is classical and should emerge from a quantum gravity in the limit ( planck s constant tends to zero ) .",
    "most theories went a step further and try to get a spacetime from quantum theory .",
    "but what happens if this prerequisite is wrong ?",
    "is it possible to derive the quantization procedure from the structure of space and time ?",
    "what is the geometrical representation of a quantum state ?",
    "this paper try to answer partly these questions .",
    "all approaches of quantum gravity have problems with the construction of the state space .",
    "if we assume that the spacetime has the right properties for a spacetime picture of quantum gravity then the quantum state must be part of the spacetime or must be geometrically realized in the spacetime .",
    "consider ( as in geometrodynamics ) a 3-sphere @xmath1 with metric @xmath2 .",
    "this metric ( as state of gr ) is modeled on @xmath1 at every 3-dimensional subspace .",
    "if @xmath2 is a metric of a homogeneous space then one can choose a small coordinate patch .",
    "but if @xmath2 is inhomogeneous then one can use a diffeomorphism to  concentrate  the inhomogeneity at a chart .",
    "now one combines these infinite charts ( we consider only metrics up to diffeomorphisms ) into a 3-sphere but without destroying the infinite charts by a diffeomorphism .",
    "then we obtain a model of a quantum state .",
    "but as we argue in this paper , wild embeddings are the right structure to realize this idea .",
    "a wild embedding can not be undone by a diffeomorphism of the embedding space .",
    "but it is non - trivial and ( in most cases ) determined by its complement .",
    "if we assume that wild embeddings are the quantum states then we must obtain the wild embedding by a quantization process . in this paper",
    "we will construct a @xmath3algebra and its enveloping von neumann algebra in the next section .",
    "then we will show that closed curves ( used to construct the @xmath3algebra ) are the observables forming a poisson algebra for a tame embedding .",
    "the deformation quantization ( so - called drinfeld - turaev - quantization ) of this poisson algebra leads to skein spaces used in knot theory .",
    "for the example of alexanders horned ball we are able to show that the corresponding skein space and the enveloping von neumann algebra are the same .",
    "therefore the wild embedding ( alexanders horned ball ) can be seen as a quantization of a tame embedding , i.e. it is a quantum state .",
    "wild embeddings occur generically in non - compact 4-manifolds with an exotic smoothness structure like @xmath4 . in the last section",
    "we discuss also the cosmological consequences of this approach .",
    "in this section we define wild and tame embeddings and construct a @xmath3algebra associated to a wild embedding .",

    "an embedding @xmath8 is _ tame _ if @xmath9 is represented by a finite polyhedron homeomorphic to @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise we call the embedding _ wild_. there are famous wild embeddings like alexanders horned sphere or antoine s necklace . in physics",
    "one uses mostly tame embeddings but as cannon mentioned in his overview @xcite , one needs wild embeddings to understand the tame one . as shown by us",
    "@xcite , wild embeddings are needed to understand exotic smoothness . as explained in @xcite by cannon , tameness is strongly connected to another topic : decomposition theory ( see the book @xcite ) .",

    "embeddings are usually classified by isotopy .",
    "an important example is the embedding @xmath19 , known as knot , where different knots are different isotopy classes of the embedding @xmath19 .",
    "wild embeddings are important to understand usual embeddings . consider a closed curve in the plane .",
    "this curve divides the plane into an interior and an exterior area ( by the jordan curve theorem ) .",
    "but what about one dimension higher , i.e. consider the embedding @xmath20 ?",
    "alexander was the first who constructed a counterexample to a generalized jordan curve theorem , alexanders horned sphere @xcite , as wild embedding @xmath21 . the main property of this wild object @xmath22 is the non - simple connected complement @xmath23 .",
    "this property is a crucial point of the following discussion .",
    "given an embedding @xmath21 which induces a decomposition @xmath24 . in case ,",

    "wild embeddings are known to be fractals @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to give an estimate for the fractal dimension for the boundary of alexander s horned ball , i.e. for a wildly embedded 2-sphere .",

    "secondly , in every of the three direction , one has two copies of the whole object , i.e. one obtains @xmath123 disjoint objects .",

    "but the last property implies that this group has the infinite conjugacy class property ( icc ) , i.e. only the identity element has a finite conjugacy class .",
    "this property has a tremendous impact on the @xmath3algebra @xcite and its enveloping von neumann algebra : + _ the enveloping von neumann algebra @xmath134 of the @xmath3algebra @xmath135 for the wild embedding @xmath125 is the hyperfinite factor @xmath136 algebra . _",
    "in this section we will describe a way from a ( classical ) poisson algebra to a quantum algebra by using deformation quantization .",
    "therefore we will obtain a positive answer to the question : does the @xmath3algebra of a wild ( specific ) embedding comes from a ( deformation ) quantization ?",
    "of course , this question can not be answered in most generality , i.e. we use the example of alexanders horned ball . but for this example we will show that the enveloping von neumann algebra of this wild embedding ( alexanders horned ball ) is the result of a deformation quantization using the classical poisson algebra ( of closed curves ) of the tame embedding .",
    "this result shows two things : the wild embedding can be seen as a quantum state and the classical state is a tame embedding .",
    "we conjecture that this result can be generalized to all other wild embeddings .",
    "let @xmath45 be an embedding of a polyhedron @xmath137 .",
    "if we have a fixed geometry of @xmath34 then we obtain also an induced geometry of @xmath138 by using the embedding . without loss of generality",

    "this integral depends only on the homotopy class of the curve @xmath74 . but also for every piece having a constant curvature",
    ", we can choose a closed curve ( in this piece ) up to homotopy .",

    "the generator of @xmath50 is a contractable closed curve used to determine the curvature ( and therefore the geometry ) .",
    "so , if we have a fixed geometry of the embedding space ( preferable constant curvature ) then we can construct the curvature ( up to diffeomorphisms ) by choosing a closed curve . in this case , _ the closed is an observable_. this concept agrees with the construction of an idempotent in the @xmath3algebra ( see subsection [ sub : c*-algebra - wild - embedding_idempotent ] ) seen as closed curve surrounding the complement of the wild embedding .",
    "in the example of alexanders horned ball , we also obtain a wild embedding of a 2-sphere ( as boundary of the ball ) into the 3-space .",
    "this case , the wild embedding of a surface into the 3-space , will be the generic case for the following .",
    "we will motivate the choice in section [ sec : wild - embeddings - exotic-4mf ] .      in this section",
    "we will describe the formal structure of a classical theory coming from the algebra of observables using the concept of a poisson algebra .",
    "in quantum theory , an observable is represented by a hermitean operator having the spectral decomposition via projectors or idempotent operators .",
    "the coefficient of the projector is the eigenvalue of the observable or one possible result of a measurement .",
    "at least one of these projectors represent ( via the gns representation ) a quasi - classical state .",
    "thus to construct the substitute of a classical observable algebra with poisson algebra structure we have to concentrate on the idempotents in the @xmath88 algebra .",
    "now we will see that the set of closed curves on a surface has the structure of a poisson algebra .",
