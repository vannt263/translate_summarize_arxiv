    "compact stars which are known from observations can be classified into two distinctive groups . the first one is exemplified by white dwarfs and the second by neutron stars .",
    "neutron stars themselves are identify with pulsars and compact x - ray sources @xcite . at the core of a neutron star the density of matter ranges from a few times of the density of normal nuclear matter to about an order of magnitude higher",
    ". thus various exotic forms of matter such as hyperons or quark - hadron mix phase are expected to emerge in the interior of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the appearance of these additional degrees of freedom and their impact not only on neutron stars but on proto - neutron stars structure and evolution as well has been the subject of extensive studies @xcite .",
    "properties of matter at such extreme densities are of particular importance in determining forms of equations of state relevant for neutron stars and in examining their global parameters @xcite . theoretical description of hadronic systems should be performed with the use of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as it is the fundamental theory of strong interactions .",
    "however , at the hadronic energy scale where the observed experimentally degrees of freedom are not quarks but hadrons the direct description of nuclei in terms of qcd become inadequate .",
    "other alternative approach has to be formulated one of which is quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite giving quantitative description of the nuclear many body problem .",
    "qhd is a relativistic quantum field theory in which nuclear matter description in terms of baryons and mesons is provided . the original model ( qhd - i ) contains nucleons interacting through the exchange of simulating medium range attraction @xmath1 meson and @xmath2 meson responsible for short range repulsion .",
    "extension ( qhd - ii ) of this theory @xcite includes also the isovector meson @xmath3 .",
    "nonlinear terms in the scalar and vector fields were added in order to get the correct value of the compressibility of nuclear matter and the proper density dependence in the vector self - energy .",
    "the variation of nucleon properties in nuclear medium is the key problem in nuclear physics . in order to incorporate quark degrees of freedom in the analysis of nuclear many - body system",
    "guichon @xcite provides a quark - meson coupling model ( qmc ) .",
    "the extension of the qmc theory namely the quark mean field model ( qmf ) , describing a nucleon with the use of the constituent quark model , has been successfully applied to study the properties of both nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "the model considered in this paper is an alternative version of the walecka approach with enlarged meson sector . in the interior of neutron",
    "stars the density of matter could exceed normal nuclear matter density up to a few times , in such high density regime nucleon fermi energies exceed the value of hyperon masses and thus the new hadronic degrees of freedom are expected to emerge .",
    "the higher the density the more various hadronic species are expected to populate .",
    "the onset of hyperon formation depends on the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "hyperons can be formed both in leptonic and baryonic processes .",
    "several relevant strong interaction processes proceed and establish the hyperon population in the neutron star matter .",
    "neutron star models are constructed at different levels of complexity starting from the most elementary one which assumes that neutrons are the only component .",
    "the more sophisticated version is formulated under the assumption that the neutron star matter has to obey the constrains of charge neutrality and @xmath4 equilibrium .",
    "thus the model considered describes high isospin asymmetric matter and it has to be extended by the inclusion of isovector - scalar meson @xmath5 ( @xmath6 meson)@xcite . for the sake of completness additional nonlinear vector meson interactions",
    "are included . when strange hadrons are taken into account uncertainties which are present in the description of nuclear matter are intensified due to the incompleteness of the available experimental data .",
    "the standard approach does not reproduce the strongly attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction seen in double @xmath7 hypernuclei . in order to construct a proper model which do include hyperons the effects of hyperon - hyperon interactions have to be taken into account .",
    "these interactions are simulated via ( hidden ) strange meson exchange : scalar meson @xmath8 ( @xmath9 meson ) and vector meson @xmath10 ( @xmath11 meson ) and influence the form of the equation of state and neutron stars properties .",
    "the solution of the presented model is gained with the mean field approximation in which meson fields are replaced by their expectation values .",
    "the parameters used are adjusted in the limiting density range around saturation density @xmath12 and in this density range give very good description in finite nuclei . however , incorporation of this theory to higher density require an extrapolation which in turn leads to some uncertainties and suffers of several shortcomings .",
    "the standard tm1 parameter set for high density range reveals an instability of neutron star matter which is connected with the appearance of negative nucleon effective mass due to the presence of hyperons .",
    "the zimanyi - moszkowski ( zm ) @xcite model in which the yukawa type interaction @xmath13 is replaced by the derivative one @xmath14 exemplifies an alternative version of the walecka model which improves the behaviour of the nucleon effective masses .",
    "it also influences the value of the incompressibility @xmath15 of neutron star matter .",
    "the derivative coupling effectively introduces the density dependence of the scalar and vector coupling constants . knowing the form of the equation of state ( eos ) is the decisive factor in determining properties of neutron stars such as : central density , mass - radius relation , crust extent or the moment of inertia .",
    "+ the essential goal of this paper is to obtain within the described above model the equation of state for the neutron star matter on the basis of calculations carried out for asymmetric nuclear matter in the relativistic mean field approach ( rmf ) and to compare the obtained results with ones that are relevant for high density calculations - namely with a quark star .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath0 meson affects the neutron stars chemical composition changing the proton fraction which in turn affects the cooling mechanism .",
    "if the proton fraction is higher than the critical value of about @xmath16 @xcite the direct urca processes can proceed and this enhances the rate of neutron star cooling . whether the proton fraction can exceed the critical value and at what density it occurs depends on the model .",
    "the proton fraction is almost entirely determined by the isospin - dependent part of the eos thus the inclusion of @xmath0 meson and nonlinear vector meson interactions influence the neutron star structure and properties.this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 outlines the extended model with derivative coupling including hyperons and additional mesons , together with the collected equations of motions .",
    "their solutions enable the construction of the equation of state . in section 3 the equilibrium conditions leading to the relevant hyperon star composition",
    "are presented together with the chosen values of parameters .",
    "section 4 contains numerical results and the discussion of their influence on neutron stars properties .",
    "for the description of properties of the infinite nuclear matter with nonzero strangeness the relevant parts of the su(3 ) structure have been involved . due to the parity conservation the appearance of pseudoscalar mesons is forbidden .",
    "the lagrangian function for the system can be written as a sum of a baryonic part including the full octet of baryons together with baryon - meson interaction terms , a mesonic part containing additional interactions between mesons which mathematically express themselves as supplementary , nonlinear terms in the lagrangian function , and a free leptonic part @xmath17 the interacting baryons are described by the lagrangian function @xmath18 which is given by @xmath19 where the spinor @xmath20 is composed of the following isomultiplets @xcite,@xcite : @xmath21 the covariant derivative @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 the model considered represents an alternative version of the walecka model in which the yukawa interaction term is replaced by the derivative coupling one . this zimanyi - moszkowski @xcite method allows to solve the problem of too low effective nucleon masses achieved in the original approach . rescaling the baryon field in a way proposed by zimanyi and moszkowski @xcite the modified lagrange function for interacting baryons",
    "is obtained @xmath24 the mesonic part of the lagrangian function ( [ lag ] ) is given by @xmath25 the field tensors @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 @xmath30 the potential function @xmath31 possesses the well - known polynomial form introduced by boguta and bodmer @xcite @xmath32 the baryon mass is denoted by @xmath33 whereas @xmath34 @xmath35 are masses assigned to the meson fields and they are taken at their physical values .",
    "the parameters entering the lagrangian function are the coupling constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 for meson fields and the self - interacting coupling constants @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "these parameters are adjusted to reproduce the bulk properties of the symmetric nuclear matter at equilibrium .",
    "they are collected in table 2 .",
    "as the @xmath0 meson field and nonlinear vector meson interactions carry isospin they contribute to the symmetry energy @xmath46 of the system .",
    "this imposes constrains on @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath45 parameters .",
    "they are adjusted to get the experimental value of the symmetry energy @xmath46 which is equal @xmath51 mev .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath47 has been redefined by comparison with the one in the original tm1 parameter set .",
    "+ the presence of hyperons demands additional coupling constants ( they are collected in table 3 ) which have been established with the use of experimental data and theoretical analysis .",
    "+ the inclusion of hyperons improve our understanding of neutron stars at higher densities .",
    "there is common belief that at suitable densities a quark star is more stable than the neutron one .",
    "thus it is interesting to compare the properties of hyperon stars with those obtained in the framework of qmf model for a quark star @xcite .",
    "now the lagrangian function possesses the following form @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes a quark field with three flavors , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and three colors .",
    "the construction of the model mimics the relativistic mean field theory , where the scalar @xmath57 and the vector meson @xmath58 fields do not couple with nucleons but directly with quarks .",
    "the quark mass has to change from its bare current mass due to the coupling to the * @xmath57 * meson . in the framework of qmf model with the use of the tm1",
    "parameter set quarks constituent masses are @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 mev whereas the bag constant is chosen at the level of * @xmath61 * mev .",
    "there are no significant differences between the presented above lagrangian function ( [ qlef ] ) and the lagrangian function ( [ lag1 ] ) .",
    "they differ in the baryonic sectors whereas the mesonic sectors for both models are nearly the same .",
    "there are only differences in coupling constants : @xmath62 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the isospin su(2 ) unbroken symmetric case , @xmath63 , so @xmath64 generators of the u(3 ) algebra @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is an identity matrix , @xmath67are gell - mann matrices",

    "may be neglected in the case of the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "baryon and meson parameters    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is usually assumed in quantum hadrodynamics the mean field approximation is adopted and for the ground state of homogeneous infinite matter quantum fields operators are replaced by their classical expectation values .",
    "thus one can separated mesonic fields into classical mean field values and quantum fluctuations which are not included in the ground state : @xmath75 the derivative terms are neglected and if one assume homogenous and isotropic infinite matter only time - like components of the vector mesons will survive .",
    "the field equations derived from the lagrange function at the mean field level are @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 the function @xmath82 is expressed with the use of an integral @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the spin and isospin projection of baryon @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the fermi momentum of species @xmath86 , @xmath88 denote the baryon number density .",
    "the dirac equation for baryons that is obtained from the lagrangian function has the following form @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the effective nucleon mass generated by the nucleon and scalar fields interactions and is defined as @xmath91",
    "in the high density regime in neutron star interiors when the fermi energy of nucleons exceeds the hyperon masses additional hadronic states are produced .",
    "the onset of hyperon formation depends on the attractive hyperon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the higher the density the more various hadronic species are expected to populate .",
    "they can be formed both in leptonic and baryonic processes . in the last one the strong interaction process such as @xmath92 proceeds .",
    "there are other relevant strong reactions that establish the hadron population in neutron star matter e.g. : @xmath93 the comparison of weak interaction time scales ( @xmath94 s ) and the time scale connected with the lifetime of a relevant star indicate that there is a difference between the matter in high energy collisions which is constrained by the isospin symmetry and the strangeness conservation whereas neutron star matter by the charge neutrality and the generalized @xmath4-equilibrium .",
    "thus realistic neutron star models describe electrically neutral high density matter with no strangeness conservation being in @xmath95 equilibrium .",
    "the last condition implies the presence of leptons .",
    "mathematically it is expressed by adding the lagrangian of free leptons to the lagrangian function ( [ lag ] ) @xmath96 neutrinos are neglected here since they leak out from a neutron star , whose energy diminishes at the same time . after electron chemical potential @xmath97 reaches the value equal to the muon mass , muons start to appear .",
    "equilibrium with respect to the reaction @xmath98 is assured when @xmath99 ( setting @xmath100 ) .",
    "the appearance of muons reduces number of electrons and affects also the proton fraction . the introduction of the asymmetry parameter @xmath101 which describes the relative neutron excess defined as @xmath102 allows to study the symmetry properties of the system .",

    "@xmath106 the rmf theory as an effective one requires the knowledge of coupling constants .",
    "there are several selected parameterizations of the theory strictly connected with the assumption that the exchange of scalar , isoscalar - vector , vector mesons and two hidden - strangeness scalar and vector mesons are responsible for interactions between specific constituents of the matter .",
    "particular sets of coupling constants are associated with the description of nucleon - nucleon , hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions and are indispensable for the the construction of the equation of state which in turn is applied for determining a neutron star properties .",
    "the enlarged walecka model uses the tm1 parameter set ( table 2)@xcite .",
    "more realistic description of a neutron star requires taking into consideration not only the interior region of a neutron star but also remaining layers , namely the inner and outer crust and surface layers .",
    "the composite eos constructed by adding bonn @xcite and negele - vautherin ( nv ) @xcite equations of state ( describing the inner crust ) to the tm1 one allows to calculate the neutron star structure for the entire neutron star density span .",
    "the parameters describing the nucleon - nucleon interactions are created in order to reproduced the properties of the symmetric nuclear matter at saturation such as the binding energy , symmetry energy and the incompressibility .",
    "other parameters are related to the hyperon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the scalar meson coupling to hyperons can be calculated from the potential depth of the hyperon in the saturated nuclear matter @xmath107 the vector coupling constants for hyperons are determined from @xmath108 symmetry as @xcite @xmath109 the single @xmath7 potential in nuclear matter is well determined as ( @xcite ) @xmath110 mev .",
    "recent analysis of atomic data @xcite indicate for repulsive @xmath111 potential in the interior of nuclei @xmath112 mev thus @xmath111 hyperons do not appear in the bulk matter calculations .",

    "the experimental data concerning hyperon - hyperon @xcite interactions are extremely scare .",
    "analysis of events which can be interpreted as the creation of @xmath115 hypernuclei allows to determine the well depths of hyperon in hyperon matter @xmath116 + having specified parameters of the model the equation of state can be calculated .",

    "the pressure @xmath119 is related to the statistical average of the trace of the spatial component @xmath121 of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath122 , whereas the energy density @xmath120 equals @xmath123 .",
    "thus the complete form of the equation of state includes contributions coming from meson , fermion and baryon fields and finally one can get the following equations for the energy density @xmath124 and pressure @xmath119 @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 given by @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132",
    "besides other properties of neutron stars the value of their masses and radii are very sensitive to the chosen model of strong interactions which in turn lead to the significant constrains on the form of the equation of state of the neutron star matter . in this paper three different groups of parameters have been applied in order to examined neutron star properties . in all of them",

    "the main effect of such an extension of the theory becomes evident studying properties of the neutron star matter especially baryon masses splitting and the form of the equation of state .",
    "fig.[fig : meff ] depicts the effective baryon masses obtained for the three mentioned above cases as functions of the baryon number density @xmath88 . for the second and third cases there are noticeable in - medium baryon masses splitting for each isomultiplet",
    "this effect reaches the maximum value for the third group of parameters , for the density span of @xmath133 and depends on the considered baryonic masses . depending on the sign of the third component of particular baryon isospin the @xmath0 meson interaction increases the proton and @xmath134 effective masses and decreases masses of neutron , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "<S> in this paper an equation of state of neutron star matter which includes strange baryons in the framework of zimanyi and moszkowski ( zm ) model has been obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the effects of the isospin dependence of the equation of state constructing for the appropriate choices of parameters the hyperons star model . </S>",
    "<S> numerous neutron star models show that the appearance of hyperons is connected with the increasing density in neutron star interiors . </S>",
    "<S> various studies have indicated that the inclusion of @xmath0 meson mainly affects the symmetry energy and through this the chemical composition of a neutron star . as the effective nucleon mass contributes to hadron chemical potentials it alters the chemical composition of the star . in the result </S>",
    "<S> the obtained model of the star not only excludes large population of hadrons but also does not reduce significantly lepton contents in the star interior . </S>"
