    "the obliquities of the host stars in exoplanetary systems display a surprising diversity , including low obliquities reminiscent of the solar system , strongly tilted stars , and retrograde systems in which the directions of stellar rotation and planetary orbital revolution are opposite .",
    "most of these results have been obtained by detecting the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , a spectroscopic anomaly that is observed during a planetary transit ( queloz et al .",
    "2000 , winn et al .",
    "in addition , for some systems the obliquity has been determined through the detection and interpretation of transits of a planet over starspots ( e.g. , deming et al .  2011 , dsert et al .",
    "2011 , nutzman et al .",
    "2011 , sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "2011 ) , and for one system ( barnes et al .",
    "2011 , szab et al .",
    "2011 ) it has been estimated using the signatures of gravity darkening from rapid stellar rotation ( barnes 2009 ) .    almost all of the previous results pertain to host stars with hot jupiters .",
    "the diversity of obliquities seen in those systems has been taken as evidence that the process of converting a `` normal '' jupiter into a hot jupiter can tilt the inclination of the planetary orbit ( see , e.g. , winn et al .  2010a , triaud et al .",
    "2010 , albrecht et al .",
    ". it would be interesting to extend these measurements to systems with longer - period planets , and multiple - planet systems , to test whether the high obliquities are indeed confined to the hot jupiter systems .",
    "unfortunately , the long - period and multiple - planet systems tend to involve smaller planets and intrinsically fainter host stars ( latham et al .  2011 , steffen et al .",
    "2012 ) , making it difficult to apply the rm and starspot techniques .",
    "this is why only two such systems have been examined to date ( sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "2012 , hirano et al .",
    "it would be advantageous to develop a technique that does not depend so critically on the signal - to - noise ratio of the transit data .",
    "one possibility is to use a combination of the measured rotation period ( @xmath1 ) , the projected rotation rate ( @xmath2 ) and the stellar radius ( @xmath3 ) to determine @xmath4 , the sine of the angle @xmath5 between the stellar rotation axis and the line of sight ( see , e.g. , hirano et al .",
    "however , this method is usually limited by the relatively poor accuracy of @xmath6 measurements for cool stars .",
    "asteroseismology provides another potentially powerful method .",
    "the detection and interpretation of the solar - like oscillations shown by solar - type stars is well known to provide accurate fundamental properties of host stars ( e.g. , bazot et al .",

    "less well known is that in some cases the rotationally - induced splittings of oscillation modes can be used to determine @xmath5 ( gizon & solanki 2003 ) .",
    "when the host star also has a transiting planet , the inclination @xmath7 of the planetary orbit can be determined , and therefore the difference in inclination between the star and planetary orbit can be calculated .",
    "in contrast to the rm and starspot techniques , the applicability of the asteroseismic method depends predominantly on the stellar parameters and hardly at all on the planetary parameters , giving the asteroseismic method a decisive advantage in measuring the stellar obliquities in systems with small planets or long - period planets .",
    "the asteroseismic analysis does , however , require bright targets and long - duration , high - cadence photometric time series to give the requisite signal - to - noise and frequency resolution for extracting clear signatures of rotation from the oscillation spectrum , and hence the stellar inclination angle .    here",
    "we present the first application of asteroseismology to the problem of stellar obliquity determination for sun - like exoplanet hosts with transiting planets .",
    "both of the systems considered in this paper have solar - type stars hosting multiple , small ( super - earth sized ) transiting planets .",
    "the identification of the two - planet kepler-50 system ( koi-262 , kic11807274 ) , along with the validation of the transit signals as arising from planets , was previously reported by steffen et al .",
    "kepler-65 ( koi-85 , kic5866724 ) is a three - planet system that is herein identified and validated for the first time .",
    "both systems involve f - type stars at the brighter end of the _ kepler _ target list , having apparent magnitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",

    "we determined the fundamental stellar properties of kepler-50 and kepler-65 by comparing a few key asteroseismic and spectroscopic observables to the outputs of stellar - evolutionary models .",
    "the asteroseismic results are based on the _ kepler _ short - cadence ( sc ) data ( gilliland et al .",
    "2010 ) , whose one - minute sampling is needed to detect the short - period oscillations observed in solar - type stars ( see also chaplin et al .",
    "the lightcurve for kepler-50 spans 18months , from _ kepler _ observing quarters 6 through 11 inclusive .",

    "the planetary transit signals were removed from the time series by applying a median high - pass filter of width appropriate for the transit durations ( see , e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "the clear separation of the relevant timescales ",
    "i.e. , periods of days associated with the transits versus periods of minutes associated with the dominant oscillations  means that this approach cleans the frequency - power spectrum in such a way as to allow the asteroseismic analysis to proceed unhindered .",
    "[ fig : powspec ] shows frequency - power spectra of the lightcurves of kepler-50 ( top panel ) and kepler-65 ( bottom panel ) .",

    "a well - known problem with the analysis of high - resolution spectra of solar - type stars is that @xmath16 is difficult to pin down , and subject to systematic errors that propagate into the uncertainties of other parameters such as @xmath14 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "for this reason , an iterative procedure was used to refine the estimates of the spectroscopic parameters ( e.g. , see bruntt et al .",

    "a two - stage procedure was adopted to estimate the fundamental properties of the stars , using as input asteroseismic parameters and complementary spectroscopic results . at the first stage for each star we sought initial estimates of the stellar properties by searching among grids of stellar evolutionary models to get a best fit to two global oscillation properties , the spectroscopically estimated effective temperature @xmath14 , and metallicity , [ fe / h ] .",

    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) considered the question of how many of _ kepler _ s multiple - planet candidates actually represent true multiple - planet systems , as opposed to unresolved blends of systems each having only one eclipsing object .",
    "for example , a candidate two - planet system could actually be a single - planet system along nearly the same line of sight to a background eclipsing binary , or there could be two eclipsing binaries along the same line of sight whose eclipses are diluted to planet - like proportions by the constant light of a foreground star .",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) recognized that false positives of this nature would be randomly distributed among the target stars , and that the number of multiple - planet candidates is much larger than would be expected if the candidates were assigned randomly to target stars . from this analysis they concluded that the vast majority of _ kepler _ s multiple - planet candidates do not represent superpositions of singly - eclipsing systems . for the population of three - transit candidates such as kepler-65 , lissauer et al .",

    "we checked for possible contaminating stars using two different datasets .",
    "firstly , we consulted the catalog by adams et al .",
    "( 2012 ) of adaptive optics ( ao ) images of a large sample of kois .",
    "the range of star magnitudes that can be detected depends on the distance to the star , such that one loses the ability to detect faint stars very close to the main star .",
    "these images have a range of 6arcsec , outside of which no information was provided only one other star was detected on the ao image , at a separation of 2.9arcsec from kepler-65",
    ". adams et al .",
    "( 2012 ) estimated that the _ kepler _ apparent magnitude of this star is @xmath44 , i.e. , about 10 magnitudes fainter than kepler-65 .    secondly , to seek companions outside the 6arcsec radius , we consulted the naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( zacharias et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this catalog ,",
    "11 stars are detected within a box of 30arcsec centered on the position of kepler-65 .",
    "only three stars were found that could be candidates for a background blend ; one at a separation of 7.2arcsec with an @xmath3-band magnitude of 18.6 ( compared to 10.5 for kepler-65 ) , a second star at a separation of 11.5arcsec with an r - band magnitude of 14.1 , and a third star at a separation of 11.8arcsec with a @xmath45-band magnitude of 19.3 ( 11.6 for kepler-65 ) .",
    "if one of these objects were a background binary star mimicking a transiting planet , then the spatial , first - moment centroid of the light gathered on the aperture would be displaced during eclipses by an amount approximately equal to the observed transit depth multiplied by the projected distance from the object to kepler-65 .",
    "therefore , since the transit depth is known independently with high precision , an upper bound on the centroid displacement can be used to set a maximum distance at which a contaminating binary can be located ( also known as the radius of confusion ) .",
    "this notion has been applied to detect background binaries among the kois ( see , e.g. , batalha et al .",
    "2010 ) , to estimate false alarm probabilities ( faps ) for particular kois ( morton & johnson 2011 ) and to validate individual candidates using the blender technique ( torres et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in the case of kepler-65",
    ", one pixel of the stellar image is saturated , and consequently the distribution of light does not follow the standard point - spread function . rather than attempting to model the saturated point - spread function , we used the flux - weighted column and row centroids produced by the _",
    "kepler _ pipeline . with this method of computing centroids",
    "we are only sensitive to displacements larger than @xmath461  pixel ( @xmath464arcsec ) , but this is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "for each transit observed at short cadence ( sc ) , we selected a window in time of width 4.8hr centered on each transit .",
    "transits that occurred within 6hr of another were excluded . to eliminate the effects of outliers we omitted data points differing by more than 3@xmath47 from a median - smoothed version of the time series , where the smoothing was performed over 30-min intervals .",
    "we found that the centroid motion was approximately a linear function of time , presumably because of the continuous pointing drift of the telescope .",
    "we corrected for this effect by fitting the out - of - transit portions of the dataset with a linear function of time .",
    "all the centroid information for each candidate in a given quarter was then phase - folded using a linear transit ephemeris from the koi input catalog ( batalha et al .",
    "the sequences of in - transit and out - of - transit centroids were approximated as gaussian distributions , and the centroid displacement was computed as the difference between the means of the distributions , with an uncertainty based on standard error propagation .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : validation ] shows the measured centroid displacements after dividing by the corresponding transit depths , so that implied physical distances are plotted .",
    "the signals can not originate from a source outside the 6arcsec radius ( shown in blue ) since no points lie outside that range .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : validation ] shows this constraint , in combination with constraints from other considerations , which together limit the radius of confusion to 0.7arcsec . one constraint is the ao imaging described previously .",
    "another is that binary stars just over 9magnitudes fainter than kepler-65 can not decrease the total amount of light by 100ppm ( the depth of the shallowest transit ) , even were they to have eclipses of 50% depth , i.e. , as given by @xmath48 \\simeq 9.2 $ ] .",
    "this limit is marked as the horizontal dotted line in right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : validation ] .",
    "no stars brighter than that limit and within 0.7 to 6arcsec from kepler-65 were detected within the ao image .",
    "with such a small radius of confusion , the probability that any of the signals come from background binaries is small .",
    "we estimate this probability to be @xmath490.15% for each candidate of kepler-65 , based on the work by morton & johnson ( 2011 ) , who calculated the local surface density of eclipsing binaries whose properties could mimic those of each _ kepler _ candidate .",
    "specifically we took their estimated false - positive probability of @xmath491% , which assumed a radius of confusion of 2arcsec , and scaled it by @xmath50 ( because we have demonstrated that the true radius of confusion for kepler-65 is 0.7arcsec ) .",
    "finally there is the `` multiplicity boost , '' as discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "since there are three transit candidates for a single _ kepler _ target , the false alarm probability of each individual transiting object is further reduced , according to the statistical argument of lissauer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . here",
    "the boost factor is approximately 50 , which would reduce the individual false - positive probabilities from @xmath490.15% to @xmath49@xmath51 .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is unlikely that any of the transit candidates arises from a background eclipsing binary .",
    "we next ask whether the signals represent three planets all orbiting the intended target star kepler-65 , or whether any of them could actually be orbiting a companion star that is gravitationally bound to it . to address this question we searched for a pattern in the transit observables that would suggest that all the planets orbit the same star ; namely , transit durations scaling as the cube root of the orbital period , which is a sign that they transit a star with similar density ( see , e.g. , fabrycky et al .  2012 ,",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "if some of the transit signals represented transits across a different star , then such a pattern would occur only by coincidence .    to measure transit durations , we constructed phase - folded transit light curves for each of the three candidates using the sc data and assuming a constant orbital period .",
    "transits that occurred within 6hr of another were excluded , removing all possible overlapping transits .",
    "the data were binned into 7.5-sec intervals to increase the speed of subsequent computations .",
    "we used a standard description of the loss of light due to a transiting planet ( mandel & agol 2002 ) to model the binned light curves simultaneously .",
    "we adopted a quadratic limb - darkening law , with the two coefficients left as free parameters ( and shared by all three candidates ) .",
    "the free parameters describing each light curve were the squared planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath52 , the impact parameter , @xmath53 , and the stellar radius divided by the orbital distance , @xmath54 .",
    "we then found the best - fitting model parameters that minimized the standard @xmath55 function , with uncertainties on the measurements defined as the standard deviation of the points outside transit for each of the folded light curves .",
    "a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code was then used to explore the range of allowed parameters .    from the best - fitting model parameters we computed the transit durations , defined as the interval over which the center of the planet is projected in front of the stellar disk .",
    "this parameter is generally well constrained , and does not change much in the presence of a small ttv signal ( whereas the ingress duration would experience larger fractional variations ) .",
    "the transit durations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : inclination ] , as a function of orbital period .",
    "we compared these values with those expected for planets in circular orbits around a star with a mean density equal to @xmath56  g@xmath57 , which is the mean density of kepler-65 as estimated from the asteroseismic analysis ( see table  1 and section  2 ) .",
    "the measured durations agree well with a model in which all planets have the same orbital inclination , which is good evidence that the planets have nearly coplanar and circular orbits around a single star with a density similar to that of kepler-65 .",
    "another way to perform this test is to use the transit observables to compute the implied mean density of the host star , and compare the result to the mean density obtained from asteroseismology . to this end",
    "we performed a second fit to the data in which the @xmath54 value for kepler-65c ( the candidate with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ) was a free parameter , and the @xmath54 values for the other two planets were fixed according to the assumption of circular orbits around the same star ( i.e. , by scaling according to orbital period and kepler s third law ) .",
    "this effectively introduces a constraint that all three planetary signals agree on the mean stellar density ( seager & malln - ornelas 2003 ) .",
    "we found the photometrically - derived mean density to be @xmath58 , in agreement with the asteroseismically derived mean density of @xmath59 ( see table  [ tab : res ] and section  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "therefore , the transit observables are consistent with a system of three planets on nearly circular orbits around a star with the same mean density as the star that is the source of the observed p - mode oscillations .",
    "a devil s advocate would raise the possibility that this agreement is a coincidence , and that one or more of the planets actually orbit a secondary companion star .",
    "this seems unlikely indeed although we do not attempt to assign a quantitative false positive probability to this scenario . to establish the probability of such a coincidence one would need to consider a realistic distribution of companions , along with their planets , transit probabilities ( which may be correlated with the transit probabilities of the primary star ) , and transit durations",
    "one would then need to exclude cases in which the companion would have been detectable in the optical spectrum , the spectrum of p - mode oscillations - times that of kepler-65 ( since it would still have shown detectable oscillations ) . ]",
    "( i.e. , by contributing signatures of its own oscillations ) , or through excessively diluted transit depths , and then compute the integrated probability of the allowed phase space .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "the detection of transit timing variations have proven to be useful for validating planets as well as constraining the masses of the transiting planets .",
    "we performed a transit - timing analysis of kepler-65 as follows .",
    "to measure individual transit times for each planet we employed a phase - folded light curve as a template function .",
    "specifically we used a phase - folded light curve that was obtained by fitting all of the transits under the assumption of a circular orbit with a constant period .",
    "the template was then fitted to the data from each transit observed at sc , with three free parameters : the central time of the transit , the out - of - transit flux level , and a constant gradient in the out - of - transit flux level .",
    "an mcmc code was used to obtain the posterior distribution for the time of transit . since no sc data were available in q0 , q1 , or q2 , for those quarters we used the transit times from the _ kepler _ ttv catalog ( rowe et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , measured as described by ford et al .  ( 2011 ) .",
    "the individual transit times were then fitted with a linear function of epoch , and this function was subtracted from the timing data to isolate any timing residuals .",

    "table  [ tbl : ttv ] shows that the additional three parameters are only justified for kepler-65d , and not for the other two planets . that planet d is singled out in this test is consistent with the hypothesis that all three planets orbit kepler-65 , as this planet has the longest orbital period and is closest to the largest and presumably most massive planet ( kepler-65c ; see section  [ sec : subtran ] and table  [ tbl : planetary ] ) , factors which enhance the amplitude of the ttv signal .",

    "for modest rates of differential rotation ( in latitude and radius ) and absolute rotation , the splittings @xmath128 of the observable high-@xmath11 , low-@xmath12 p modes will take very similar values , hence tending to the approximation of solid - body rotation ( ledoux 1951 ) . here",

    "secondly , we applied a 20-day median smoothing filter to divide the raw data . both approaches led to periodograms in good agreement with our main results .",
    "both stars show several significant , closely spaced peaks in their periodograms .",
    "the spread in period of the peaks will have contributions from the finite spot lifetimes and might also suggest the presence of surface differential rotation . fig .",
    "[ fig : surf ] also shows periodograms obtained from particular subsets of the data , which suggest that the rotation periods might be evolving with time . again , this might be associated with stochastic variability due to the spot lifetimes , or it could have a contribution due to changes in the spot latitudes .",
    "these signatures are not unexpected for such hot stars ( collier cameron 2007 ) but the low s / n of the stellar variability in the lightcurves makes it hard to test the results in greater detail .",
    "it is worth adding that we also checked that the spread of significant periods was not an artifact of the observational window function .",
    "we sampled commensurate sine waves of period 8d at the same time stamps as the real , cleaned pdc - map lightcurves , and found that the resulting periodograms displayed a much smaller width of significant periods than the real data ( of order 0.2 to 0.4d ) .",
    "as in hirano et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , for each star the continuous range of periods containing all peaks with more than half the power of the highest peak was taken as the uncertainty on the surface rotation period , with the center of the range adopted as the quoted period , @xmath1 .",
    "the rotation periods obtained in this way were @xmath198 for kepler-50 and @xmath199 for kepler-65 .",
    "the rotational frequency splittings @xmath157 given by the asteroseismic analysis are equivalent to rotation periods @xmath200 of @xmath201 for kepler-50 and @xmath202 for kepler-65 .",
    "the close agreement between the surface and internal rotation rates is consistent with the expectation that the frequency splittings of p modes observed in main - sequence stars are largely determined by the rotation profile in the stellar envelope ( as in the case of the sun )",
    ".    we can also compare our results with @xmath203 estimates extracted from the spectroscopic data ( see section  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "for kepler-50 the spectroscopic analyses gave @xmath204 ( sme ) and @xmath205 ( spc ) , while for kepler-65 they gave @xmath206 ( sme ) and @xmath207 ( spc ) .",
    "to compare with the asteroseismic results , we converted the estimated rotational frequency splittings to projected rotational velocities using @xmath208 with the stellar radii @xmath3 given by the asteroseismic analysis discussed in section  [ sec : prop ] .",
    "these conversions gave equivalent asteroseismically determined projected velocities of @xmath209 for kepler-50 and @xmath210 for kepler-65 .",
    "again , we find agreement between the asteroseismic and surface estimates .",
    "we note that the spc @xmath203 values are higher than the sme values by about 20% , in agreement with the findings by torres et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "finally , we may combine the spot modulation and @xmath203 results to provide independent estimates of @xmath5 , via @xmath211 when we used the sme results for @xmath203 we found that sines of the angles were constrained at the @xmath0 level to lie above 0.89 for kepler-50 and 0.90 for kepler-65 , again implying that both stars have their rotation axes nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "when the spc @xmath203 were used we obtained @xmath212 for both systems suggesting that ( at least for these systems ) the spc results are overestimated .",
    "our central result is that the host stars of the kepler- 50 and kepler-65 planetary systems have their rotation axes nearly perpendicular to the line of sight , with @xmath213 constrained at the @xmath0 level to lie above 0.97 and 0.91 , respectively .",
    "expressed in terms of angles , we have @xmath214 for kepler-50 and @xmath215 for kepler-65 .",
    "the orbital inclinations of the planets in each system are also near 90@xmath216 , with a deviation of only @xmath217 for the planets of kepler-50 and @xmath218 for the planets of kepler-65 .",
    "therefore our observations are consistent with small differences in the stellar and orbital inclination angles , and low stellar obliquities .",
    "a limitation of the results is that it is possible for the obliquity to be large but for the difference in inclination angles to be small .",
    "spherical geometry dictates that the 3d obliquity angle @xmath219 between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis is given by @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the projected angle on the sky between the orbital and rotational angular momentum vectors , which the asteroseismic method can not provide .",
    "this is the converse of the situation with , for example , the rm and spot - occultation methods , for which the data reveal @xmath221 but are generally insensitive to @xmath5 . to overcome this limitation",
    ", one would need to combine the various measurement techniques to determine both @xmath221 and @xmath5 for the same system , or else conduct observations of many systems and perform a statistical analysis of the ensemble ( see , e.g. , fabrycky & winn 2009 ) .",
    "measuring the rm effects given by the planets in the two systems considered in this paper would be very challenging , due to the small sizes of the planets .",
    "the highest - amplitude rm signal for kepler-50 would be around @xmath222 ( given by kepler-50c ) , while for kepler-65 it would be @xmath223 ( given by kepler-65c ) .",
    "while the two stars we have analyzed are special  in the sense that they have transits  it is important to test the null hypothesis that they are members of a population of stars randomly oriented in space . put another way : had the stars been randomly oriented , what is the chance that the inclination angles would have been as close to @xmath154 , as observed ? for an isotropic distribution , the probability of observing @xmath224 is simply @xmath225 . evaluating this for kepler-50 and kepler-65 we find the chance to be 26% and 42% individually , and the chance of observing both of them so close to @xmath154 is 11% . in this sense",
    "there is only an 11% chance we would have obtained our results in the absence of any correlation between the orientations of the stellar rotation and planetary orbits .    despite these limitations ,",
    "let us consider the implications of low obliquities .",
    "the number of extrasolar multiplanet systems for which the stellar obliquity has been measured is now four , with kepler-50 and kepler-65 joining the previously studied systems kepler-30 ( sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "2012 ) and koi-94 ( hirano et al .",
    "in all four cases , the obliquity is consistent with zero .",
    "we have already summarized our results for kepler-50 and kepler-65 , and for the other two systems @xmath221 was found to be consistent with zero to within about @xmath226 .",
    "several years ago these results would have seemed mundane .",
    "low obliquities are expected in the standard picture in which the star and planets have the same direction of angular momentum originating from a common accretion disk .",
    "furthermore , up until 2008 , low obliquities had been observed in all the exoplanetary systems that had been examined ( all involving single hot jupiters ) . since that time",
    ", systems with hot jupiters have been found to have host stars with a wide range of obliquities ( albrecht et al .",
    "those results have been taken as evidence that the process that produces hot jupiters also tilts their orbits relative to the initial plane of their formation .",
    "specifically , the results have been taken to support theories for the origin of hot jupiters involving few - body dynamics and tidal circularization ( alternatively referred to as high - eccentricity migration ) as opposed to the formerly dominant paradigm of disk migration .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , that this conclusion depends critically on the assumption that the current stellar equatorial plane is aligned with the original plane of the planetary orbits .",
    "several papers have questioned this assumption .",
    "bate et al .  (",
    "2010 ) suggested that the chaotic environment of a star - forming region might lead to large mismatches between the direction of stellar rotation and the orientation of the late - stage protoplanetary disk .",
    "thies et al .",
    "( 2011 ) proposed that inclined planets arise from capture of gas from a neighboring star .",
    "lai et al .  ( 2011 ) presented a theory of magnetic interaction between a young star and the inner edge of its accretion disk that can tip the star by a significant angle .",
    "rogers et al .  ( 2012 ) considered stars with convective cores and radiative envelopes , and found that they might be susceptible to a directional wandering of the outermost layers of the star due to transport of angular momentum by internal gravity waves from the convective - radiative boundary .    in a few cases , it has been possible to compare the orientation of stellar rotation and the orientation of a surrounding disk ( le bouquin et al .",
    "2009 , watson et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the results have favored the hypothesis of close alignment and low obliquities . however , more stringent tests are warranted , and are provided by the results for the four multiplanet systems kepler-30 , 50 , 65 , and koi-94 .",
    "the low obliquities suggest that high obliquities are confined to the hot - jupiter systems , or at least have not yet falsified that hypothesis .",
    "the results are therefore starting to provide support to the argument that most or all hot jupiters are formed through inclination - lifting processes and not via disk migration .",
    "all four of the stars are cool enough to have outer convective zones ( indeed , kepler-50 and kepler-65 must have convection because they exhibit solar - like oscillations ) .",
    "it is unclear how effective the model of rogers et al .",
    "( 2012 ) might be for stars with thin convective envelopes ( e.g. , like kepler-50 , kepler-65 and koi-94 , which are all hotter than the sun ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this theory already has difficulty accommodating the hot - jupiter results involving cool , convective stars with high obliquities , namely hat - p-11 ( winn et al .",
    "2010b , sanchis - ojeda & winn 2011 ) , hd  80606 ( winn et al .  2009 ,",
    "pont et al .",
    "2009 , hbrard et al .",
    "2010 ) , and wasp-8 ( queloz et al .  2010 ) .    of course",
    ", one should not be satisfied with a sample of only four systems , especially given the limitations caused by projection effects as noted above .",
    "the asteroseismic technique that was deployed in this work has the advantage that the detectability of the signal is chiefly a function of the stellar properties , as opposed to the planetary properties , and therefore has no intrinsic difficulty with small planets or long - period planets .",
    "we expect it will be possible to apply this technique to a sample of at least 10 other _ kepler _ systems in the near future .",
    "it will be possible to draw stronger conclusions with these results in hand .",
    "definitive conclusions will also be possible on individual systems with transiting exoplanets when asteroseismology demonstrates that @xmath5 is significantly different from @xmath154 .",

    "in the second stage of the stellar properties estimation ( section  [ sec : prop ] ) three members of the team ( sb , jcd and tm ) performed a detailed modelling of the stars using estimates of the individual oscillation frequencies and the revised spectroscopic data as inputs .",
    "sb made use of the yale stellar evolution code , yrec ( demarque et al .",
    "2008 ) to model both stars .",
    "the input physics included the opal equation of state tables of rogers & nayfonov ( 2002 ) , and opal high - temperature opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) supplemented with low -temperature opacities from ferguson et al .",
    "all nuclear reaction rates were from adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , except for the rate of the @xmath227 reaction , which was fixed at the value of formicola et al .",
    "models were constructed for two values of core overshoot , 0 and 0.2@xmath228 .",
    "two families of models were constructed , one that included the diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements as per the formulation of thoul et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and one that did not include any diffusion and settling .",
    "yrec was used in an iterative mode whereby the final @xmath14 and radius for a star of a given mass and metallicity was specified , and for a given mixing length parameter @xmath229 the code iterated over the initial helium abundance @xmath230 until a model with the specified @xmath14 and radius was found .",
    "this is similar to the construction of a standard solar model , although in the solar case iterations are made over both the mixing length parameter and @xmath230 with solar age a fixed independent constraint .",
    "since the ages of the _ kepler _ stars are not known independently , iteration over @xmath230 were performed for many different values of the mixing length parameter . all solutions for which the initial helium abundance was less than the primordial helium abundance , @xmath231 were rejected .",
    "@xmath231 was assumed to be @xmath232 .",
    "corrections for near - surface effects ( the so - called surface term ) were handled in the following manner .",
    "the first step was the construction of a standard solar model with exactly the same physics as that used to model the _ kepler _ stars .",
    "this yielded the set @xmath233 of solar model frequencies .",
    "these were then used to estimate a set of `` surface term '' frequency offsets , @xmath234 , for the sun by computing differences between the solar model frequencies and the solar low - degree frequencies observed by the birmingham solar oscillations network ( bison ) ( as listed in basu et al .  2009 ) .    for each stellar model , @xmath235 , @xmath233 and @xmath234",
    "were then scaled to the mass and radius of @xmath235 using the homology scaling @xmath236 .",
    "the resulting @xmath237-@xmath238 relation was then used to correct the stellar model for the surface term . using a least squares minimization a factor @xmath239",
    "was selected so as to minimize @xmath240 over all observed modes , where @xmath241 , with @xmath238 evaluated at @xmath242 .",
    "jcd followed a prescription that has previously been applied to the hubble observations of hd 17156 ( gilliland et al . , 2011 ) , and several _ kepler _ exoplanet host stars , i.e. hat - p-7 ( christensen - dalsgaard et al . , 2010 ) , _ kepler_-10 ( batalha et al . , 2011 ) and _ kepler_-36 ( carter et al . 2012 ) .",
    "stellar evolutionary models were computed with the astec code ( christensen - dalsgaard , 2008a ) .",
    "the calculations used the opal equation of state tables ( see rogers et al .",
    "1996 ) and opal opacities at temperatures above @xmath243 ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) ; at lower temperature the ferguson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) opacities were used .",
    "nuclear reactions were calculated using the nacre parameters ( angulo et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "convection was treated using the bhm - vitense ( 1958 ) mixing - length formulation .",
    "frequencies were computed for the models using adipls ( christensen - dalsgaard , 2008b ) and then corrected for surface effects following the prescription of kjeldsen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    for each evolutionary sequence in the grid of astec models ,",
    "the model @xmath244 whose surface - corrected frequencies provided the best @xmath55 match to the observations was selected .",
    "the best match was obtained from application of homology scaling , under the assumption that in the vicinity of @xmath244 frequencies could be calculated using @xmath245 , where @xmath246^{-1.5}$ ] , @xmath3 being the surface radius of the model .",
    "a best - fitting model was then determined by minimizing the sum @xmath247 over all observed modes , as a function of @xmath125 .",
    "the resulting minimum value of @xmath125 defined an estimate of the radius of the best - fitting model along the given sequence .",
    "the other properties of this best - fitting model were determined by linear interpolation in @xmath3 , to the minimum of @xmath3 .",
    "statistical analysis of the ensemble of best - fitting properties from all evolutionary sequences then yielded the final stellar properties , and their uncertainties ( see christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "2010 , carter et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "tm used the asteroseismic modeling portal ( amp ) , a web - based tool tied to teragrid computing resources that uses a parallel genetic algorithm ( metcalfe & charbonneau 2003 ) to optimize , in an automated manner , the match to observational data ( see metcalfe et al .",
    "2009 , woitaszek et al .",
    "2009 for more details ) .",
    "amp employs the aarhus stellar evolution code astec ( christensen - dalsgaard 2008a ) and adiabatic pulsation code adipls ( christensen - dalsgaard 2008b ) .",
    "models were made using the opal 2005 equation of state and the most recent opal opacities supplemented by ferguson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) opacities at low temperature , nuclear reaction rates from nacre ( angulo et al .",
    "1999 ) , and helium diffusion and settling following michaud & proffitt ( 1993 ) .",
    "convection was treated with standard mixing - length theory without overshooting ( bhm - vitense 1958 ) .",
    "each amp model evaluation involved the computation of a stellar evolution track from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) through a mass - dependent number of internal time steps , terminating prior to the beginning of the red giant stage .",
    "the asteroseismic age was optimized along each evolutionary track using a binary decision tree under the assumption that @xmath18 is a monotonically decreasing function of age ( see metcalfe et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "the kjeldsen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) prescription was again applied in an attempt to deal with the surface term .",
    "the optimal model was then subjected to a local analysis that uses singular value decomposition ( svd ) to quantify the uncertainties of the final model parameters ( see creevey et al ."
