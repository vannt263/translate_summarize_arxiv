    "there has been an extensive debate about the correct expression for the momentum density of electromagnetic waves in linear media .",
    "the minkowski s expression @xmath1 and the abraham s @xmath2 are the most famous ones , both proposed in the beginning of the twentieth century @xcite . in these expressions , @xmath3 is the electric field , @xmath4 is the magnetic field , @xmath5 is the electric displacement field and @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric and magnetic dipole densities of the medium .",
    "@xmath10 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath11 is the permeability of free space and @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "these expressions make qualitatively different predictions for the momentum of light in a medium .",
    "the minkowski formulation predicts that a photon with momentum @xmath13 in vacuum increases its momentum to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the refraction index of the medium , on entering a dielectric medium . the abraham expression , however , states that the photon momentum decreases to @xmath16 on entering the medium .",
    "the debate of which form is the correct one persisted for many decades , with experiments and theoretical discussions , from time to time , seeming to favor either one of the two formulations .",
    "arguments that sometimes are naively used in favor of the minkowski formulation are the experiments of jones _",
    "_ @xcite that measured the radiation pressure on mirrors immersed in dielectric media , the experiments of ashkin and dziedzic @xcite that measured the radiation pressure on the free surface of a liquid dielectric , the experiments of gibson _ et al .",

    "_ @xcite that measured the recoil momentum of atoms in a gas after absorbing one photon .",
    "all these experiments are consistent with the consideration that a photon in a medium has momentum @xmath14 .",
    "arguments that sometimes are naively used in favor of the abraham formulation are the symmetry of its energy - momentum tensor , compatible with conservation of angular momentum , the agreement of its electromagnetic momentum density with the predictions of einstein box theories @xcite in a direct way , the experiments of walker _",

    "_ @xcite that measured a push force on the end face of a silica filament when a light pulse exits it .",
    "these experiments are consistent with the abraham form for the momentum density of an electromagnetic wave in a dielectric medium .    although the debate is still supported by some researchers , penfield and haus showed , more than forty years ago , that neither of the forms is completely correct on its own @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic momentum of electromagnetic waves in linear media is always accompanied by a material momentum , and when the material counterpart is taken into account , both the minkowski and abraham forms for the electromagnetic momentum density yield the same experimental predictions .",
    "they are simply two different ways , among many others , to divide the total momentum density .",
    "a revision of this discussion and the eventual conclusion can be found in ref .",
    "in fact , the experimental results of jones _ et al . _",
    "were reproduced by gordon @xcite and loudon @xcite using the abraham form for the electromagnetic momentum density and calculating the material momentum by means of the lorentz force .",
    "gordon also reproduced the results of ashkin and dziedzic by the same way @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the experiments of gibson _ et al .",

    "and leonhardt @xcite showed that the experiments of campbell _ et al .",

    "israel @xcite has derived the experimental results of walker _",
    "_ using the minkowski formulation with a suitable combination of electromagnetic and material energy - momentum tensors and the conclusions of the experiments of she _",
    "_ were recently questioned @xcite .",
    "what happens is that for each experimental situation one formulation can predict the behavior of the system in a simpler way , but the minkowski , abraham and other proposed formulations are always equivalent . in a recent article , pfeifer _ et al . _",
    "show the conditions in which we can neglect the material counterpart of the minkowski energy - momentum tensor @xcite , justifying why it is possible to predict the behavior of the experiments of jones _",
    "et al . _ and the modeling of optical tweezers only with the electromagnetic tensor in the minkowski formulation",
    "to summarize , i quote ref .",
    "@xcite : `` ( ... ) no electromagnetic wave energy - momentum tensor is complete on its own .",
    "when the appropriate accompanying energy - momentum tensor for the material medium is also considered , experimental predictions of all various proposed tensors will always be the same , and the preferred form is therefore effectively a matter of personal choice . ''",
    "but we can ask if there is , among all possible ways to divide the total momentum density of an electromagnetic wave in a medium into electromagnetic and material parts , a natural one .",
    "i believe there is .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fields that appear in the lorentz force law and actually interact with electric charges .",
    "they are the fields that can transfer momentum to matter .",
    "so , in my point of view , they must be the fields that may carry electromagnetic momentum . @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath6 should be seen as averaged quantities of material and electromagnetic properties , used to simplify the calculations . in this sense",
    ", it seems natural that the electromagnetic part of the momentum density of an electromagnetic wave in a medium has the form @xmath18 , which does not have an explicit dependence on the properties of the medium .",
    "the material part of the momentum should be calculated as the momentum acquired by the medium by the action of the lorentz force on the charges of the medium .",
    "an electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor that has these characteristics was previously proposed by obukhov and hehl @xcite .",
    "here i show the validity of this division of the momentum density in a series of examples .",
    "the form @xmath0 for the electromagnetic momentum density is equivalent to the abraham one in non - magnetic media . as in all cited experiments",
    "the media under consideration were non - magnetic , there is no difference between the treatment with this momentum density and the abraham one .",
    "only in magnetic media the differences will appear .",
    "gordon @xcite , loudon @xcite and mansuripur @xcite calculated the material momentum density of electromagnetic waves in linear non - dispersive dielectrics using directly the lorentz force law .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations to calculate , also by the lorentz force law , the momentum transfer to more general dispersive media .",
    "recently , hinds and barnett @xcite used the lorentz force to calculate the momentum transfer to a single atom . here",
    ", following this method in an analytical treatment , i show that it may exist permanent transfers of momentum to the media due to the passage of electromagnetic pulses that were not considered before .",

    "mansuripur has treated magnetic materials in another work @xcite , but the force equation , results and conclusions of this work are different from his .",

    "[ conc ] , i present my concluding remarks .",
    "the momentum transfer to a linear non - absorptive and non - dispersive dielectric medium due to the presence of an electromagnetic wave can be calculated directly using the lorentz force @xcite .",
    "the force acting on electric dipoles can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dipole moment . in a linear , isotropic and non - dispersive dielectric ,",
    "the electric dipole moment density can be written as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electric susceptibility of the medium .",
    "it is important to stress that the consideration of a non - dispersive linear medium must be seen as an approximation , once every material medium is inevitably accompanied of dispersion .",
    "but if the electromagnetic wave has a narrow frequency spectrum and the dispersion is small in this region of frequencies , this treatment will give the material contribution of the total momentum of the wave with a good precision .",

    "so the force density in a linear non - dispersive dielectric and magnetic medium can be written as    @xmath25    i will calculate the material momentum due to the action of the forces @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 separately . in a linear , isotropic and non - dispersive magnetic medium , we have @xmath29}\\mathbf{b}$ ] , where @xmath30 is the magnetic susceptibility of the medium .    in his treatment of the material part of the momentum of electromagnetic waves in magnetic materials @xcite , mansuripur uses a specific model for a magnetic medium , obtaining a different equation for the bound currents in the medium .",
    "the form @xmath24 is more general and agrees with his form in a homogeneous medium . as the interfaces between different linear media will be treated here , the general form for the bound currents must be used .",
    "he also takes the vector product of the bound currents with @xmath31 instead of @xmath4 to find the force density .",
    "i do nt think this is adequate .",
    "for these reasons , i believe that the present treatment to find the material momentum of electromagnetic waves in magnetic media is more adequate than that of mansuripur .",
