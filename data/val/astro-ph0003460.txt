    "however , the first x - ray peak , in terms of duration and relative amplitude , is consistent with preceding the final radio peak by approximately 10,000 seconds .",
    "longer simultaneous and uninterupted x - ray / radio observations , however , are required to confirm if such behaviour is characteristic of such a soft to hard x - ray transition state .",
    "based on the interpretation of the radio oscillations in ( @xcite ) , it is possible that these oscillations correspond to discrete ejection events associated with state transitions .    in",
    ", the radio oscillations rise when the x - ray dips ( pooley & fender 1997 , mirabel et al .",
    "we might be seeing directly ( figure 5 ) the same phenomena without the need to make the shift for figure 6 .",

    "the interesting characteristics of the radio spectra of during the low - hard state are that they are continuously flat or inverted for a radio source at about the same intensity level .",
    "this is very similar to the radio emission of cyg  x1 in its low - hard state ( @xcite , brocksopp et al .",
    "1999 ) or the z sources ( e.g. hjellming et al . 1990a , hjellming et al .",

    "as noted by hjellming and han ( 1995 ) , stable emission from a radio source is difficult to maintain as relativistic plasma tends to expand and therefore implies a decaying radio emission .",
    "relativistic plasmas are almost impossible to confine , therefore one needs a continuous injection of plasma in the radio emitting region in order to produce the stable radio emission .",
    "the optically thick spectra are produced from an inhomogeneous source with a range of optical depths .",
    "therefore , the radio emission of  could be explained if one invokes continuous injection of relativistic particles at the base of a compact and conical jet [ e.g. blandford & k@xmath30nigl ( 1979 ) or hjellming & johnson ( 1988 ) ] . in this model , the higher radio frequencies would come from a region closer to the base of the jet ( where the optical depth is too high for the lower frequencies ) .",
    "pooley et al . ( 1999 ) have reported modulation of the radio emission from cyg  x1 at the orbital period of 5.6 days , with a stronger modulation at higher frequency .",
    "this indicates that the higher frequencies come from a region closer to the compact object and therefore at the base of the jet , which is in agreement with the conical jet model , such as the one of hjellming & johnson ( 1988 ) and also in agreement with basic blandford and k@xmath30nigl jet model .",
    "it is interesting to note that a compact and continuous jet has now been detected in cyg  x-1 ( @xcite ) from vlba observations .",
    "the radio emitting region of  is 2 @xmath1 6 mas with the smallest synthesised beam at 9 ghz ( fender 1999 , private communication ) , which is equivalent to a typical size of @xmath4 ten astronomical units .",
    "this is about a factor 10 smaller than the physical size of the compact jet reported by mirabel & rodr ' iguez ( 1999 ) for in a weak optically thick radio state ( similar to the low - hard state of  and ) .",
    "such inverted or flat radio spectra , associated with weak radio emission , are commonly found in the compact core of active galactic nuclei and are usually associated with small scale ( or compact ) jets ( @xcite ) . but as noted in fender et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , the spectra of compact jets in x - ray binaries are much flatter than `` flat spectrum '' agns where a high frequency cut - off is observed in the millimeter regime .",
    "based on these similarities with cyg  x1 and agn , it is very likely that the radio emission from  arises from a compact , continuous and conical jet .",
    "this is consistent with the results from wilms et al .",

    "the above derived limits on the size of the emitting region in  are consistent with the size of the radio emitting region of .",

    "linear polarisation was again detected on 1999 march 3 ( two years later ) at a higher level of @xmath4 5 % ( both at 4800 mhz and 8640 mhz ) during an optically thin radio event associated with the return of radio emission after the 1998 high - soft state .",
    "the position angle of the electric field vector was 65.6 @xmath7 5.3  at 8640 mhz , in agreement with the orientation observed two years before .",

    "the electric field vector of the emitted radiation is parallel rather than perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "its direction is indicated by the solid lines in figure [ fig_atcafeb97 ] .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field is quite ordered within the compact jet and that its averaged orientation is relatively stable over a two years period .",

    "we have been using the multi - frequency synthesis technique to improve our spatial resolution ( @xcite ) , i.e. all 32 spectral channels of the 128 mhz bandwidths of each frequency have been retained at their original position and have been simultaneously used during the imaging process .",
    "the two frequencies have been chosen in order to complement each other and provide the best u - v coverage in the 3 cm band . in order to reduce any artifacts due to phase errors ,",
    "we have used a cycle of 8 minutes on  and 2 minutes on the closest phase calibrators b164650 ( @xmath4 4 degrees away from ) .",

    "this is consistent with the size of the compact jet recently detected in .",

    "a similar correlation has also been observed in  during the low - hard state ( brocksopp et al .",
    "1999 ) . as noted in fender et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , it is possible that the corona is at the base of the compact jet ; the high energy tail of the electron distribution being responsible for the synchrotron emission observed at radio ( and possibly higher ) frequencies .",
    "the correlation between the corona and the compact jet may reflect variability resulting from changes in the accretion rate , therefore implying a correlation between the compact jet , the corona and the accretion rate . the thermal emission from the inner part of the accretion disk",
    "is generally not observed in the low - hard state , but it might also reflect the changes in the accretion rate .",
    "such questions could be addressed by future observations with _",
    "xmm _ and _ chandra_. we should note that these correlations may result from the precession of the accretion disk as suggested by brocksopp et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for .",
    "the fact that the correlation between the radio and the x - ray flux in the low - hard state is consistent with being linear is somewhat difficult to understand in the context of advection dominated models that postulate large outflows ( e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ) . in the absence of such large outflows , standard adaf models fail to produce , by several orders of magnitude , the observed radio flux ( wilms et al . 1999 ) . in a wind - producing adaf model ,",
    "a decrease in luminosity is associated in part , at least , with a further decrease in radiative efficiency .",
    "this , however , is expected to result in a greater rate of mass outflow .",
    "therefore one expects the radio flux to decrease somewhat more slowly than the x - ray flux , in contrast to the linear dependence observed .",
    "if in fact the transition to the low - hard state is a transition to an adaf state , perhaps then the radiative efficiency remains relatively constant with further decreases in flux .",
    "following the equation of marscher ( 1983 ) , hard x - rays resulting from synchrotron self - compton emission from the compact jet of  can be neglected as it is negligible compared to the contribution from the corona .",
    "a similar conclusion has been drawn by brocksopp et al .",

    "the following list summarizes the conclusions we have been able to draw from this multi - wavelength analysis of the behaviour of :    * in the low - hard x - ray state , we observe a very strong 3-way correlation between the radio , soft and hard x - rays emission , believed to be the result of a coupling between the comptonising corona and a compact jet .",
    "models of persistent accreting black holes would need to take into account this coupling in the low - hard state and the quenching of the radio jet in the high - soft state .",
    "the off x - ray state is consistent with being a lower - luminosity low - hard state , in all three energy bands . *",
    "the radio spectrum is flat or slightly inverted .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in the black hole .",
    "the radio emission can be understood as synchrotron emission from a compact jet , with quasi - continuous injection of relativistic plasma . * transitions from the low - hard state to the high - soft state ( or vice versa )",
    "are possibly associated with discrete ejection(s ) of expanding relativistic plasma . *",
    "the pattern of behaviour observed in radio , soft- and hard - x - rays is sufficient to explain in broad terms all the observations over several years . *",
    "linear polarisation has been detected from the radio emission of  with a nearly constant polarisation angle , which points to a favored axis in the system .",
