    "at least 14 stellar debris streams in the galactic halo have now been identified in photometric surveys ( see @xcite for a review ) . a similar number of dynamically cold substructures have been detected in velocity space @xcite .",
    "each of these streams is interesting as a partial record of the accretion history of our galaxy .",
    "however , and perhaps more importantly , these streams can also serve as very sensitive probes of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "globular cluster streams are particularly important in this respect as they are dynamically very cold @xcite .",
    "a large sample of streams will eventually enable us to constrain the distribution of dark matter in the halo in a detailed and self - consistent manner . enlarging",
    "the sample of known streams will also increase the probability that we may detect unmistakable signs of perturbations by dark matter sub - halos @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the ebs first detected by @xcite using the more complete coverage available in the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 , @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly describe our analysis in section [ analysis ] .",
    "we characterize the ebs and and a possible progenitor in section [ discussion ] and we put preliminary constraints on the orbit in section [ orbit ] .",
    "we make concluding remarks section [ conclusion ] .",
    "data comprising @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry for @xmath4 stars in the region @xmath5 and @xmath6 were extracted from the sdss dr7 database using the sdss casjobs query system .",
    "the data were analyzed using the matched filter technique described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "applied in the color - magnitude domain , the matched filter is a means by which we can optimally differentiate between halo streams and the foreground disk population .    in this paper",
    "we use filters based on the padova database of theoretical stellar isochrones @xcite .",
    "the advantages of using theoretical isochrones include the ability to explore a wider range of age and metallicity than is available among the globular clusters within the sdss footprint , as well as the ability to extend the filters to very faint absolute magnitudes ( useful for examining very nearby structures ) .",
    "these isochrones were combined with the deep luminosity function of @xmath7 cen measured by @xcite to generate appropriate filters .",
    "we used all stars with @xmath8 , and we dereddened the sdss photometry as a function of position on the sky using the prescription of @xcite applied to the @xmath9 maps of @xcite .",
    "the field star distribution was sampled using roughly half the sloan survey area .",
    "we applied the filters to the entire survey area , and the resulting weighted star counts were summed by location on the sky to produce two dimensional , filtered surface density maps .    in figure 1",
    "we show the filtered star count distribution using a filter based on an isochrone with z = 0.0003 and an age of 13 gyrs , shifted in magnitude so as to provide optimal contrast for display purposes for stellar populations at a distance of 9.7 kpc .",
    "the surface density map was generated by averaging the weights of each star based on its distance from the @xmath10 and @xmath11 color - magnitude loci .",
    "the surface densities have been binned to a pixel size of @xmath12 and smoothed using a gaussian kernel with @xmath13 .",
    "the region shown in figure 1 is a complex of streams overlaid on a rapidly rising population of foreground disk stars .",
    "visible to varying degrees ( due to the ( m - m)@xmath14 = 14.83 magnitude shift of the filter ) are five well known features , namely the sagittarius stream @xcite , the monoceros ring @xcite , the anticenter stream ( acs , grillmair 2006b ) , gd-1 @xcite , and the `` eastern banded structure '' , or ebs @xcite .",
    "while the ebs was only partly revealed in @xcite s dr5 analysis due to a large swath of missing data , the additional coverage in dr7 allows us to trace the ebs for some @xmath0 from the southern edge of the dr7 footprint in hydra to an indeterminate end in cancer .",
    "the curvature of the stream takes it to within @xmath15 of the similarly curved , southern end of the gd-1 stream , but there are clear discontinuities in position , distance , and color - magnitude distribution that rule out any physical association between them .",
    "@xcite used a significance test ( the `` t - statistic '' ) that measures the median contrast along its length between a putative stream and the surrounding field .",
    "the t - statistic for the ebs , comparing with the field extending the length of the stream and @xmath16 to the east , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the stream is clearly not due to random fluctuations in the field ; the filtered stream signal is @xmath17 larger than the rms measured using identically sampled , neighboring field stars .",
    "a gaussian that matches the integrated , lateral profile of the stream has a full - width - at - half - maximum of 1.0 . at a distance of 9.7 kpc",
    "( see below ) this corresponds to a spatial extent perpendicular to our line of sight of 170 pc .",
    "this is roughly twice as broad as typical , presumed globular cluster streams @xcite , but considerably narrower than the @xmath18 kpc widths associated with presumed dwarf galaxy streams @xcite . in the absence of heating effects due to a rather eccentric orbit ( see below ) , this would suggest a progenitor that was significantly more massive than the globular clusters believed to be responsible for the currently known cold streams .",
    "figure 3 shows color - magnitude distributions ( cmds ) , dereddened as prescribed by @xcite using the @xmath9 maps of @xcite , of stars lying within @xmath19 of the centerline of the ebs , after subtraction of the cmd of stars lying between @xmath20 and @xmath21 both east and west of the stream .",
    "isochrones with z = 0.0003 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath22 ) and an age of 13 gyrs evidently match the turn - off and main sequence colors reasonably well .",
    "we infer that the progenitor of the stream was old and metal poor .    following @xcite we shift the main sequence used to construct our filter both brightward and faintward to estimate the stream s distance . to avoid issues related to a possible difference in age between our adopted isochrone and the stream stars , we use only the portion of the filter with @xmath23 , where the bright cutoff is 0.3 mag below the main sequence turn off .",
    "we find that the strength of the southern half of the stream peaks at a distance modulus of @xmath24 mag , while the northern half of the stream peaks at @xmath25 mag .",
    "this puts the southern end of the stream at a sun - centric distance of @xmath26 kpc , while the northern end is at @xmath27 kpc .",
    "the portion of the stream visible in figure 1 is evidently almost perpendicular to our line of sight .    integrating the background - subtracted , unfiltered counts of stars within @xmath28 of the z = 0.0003 isochrone along the length of the stream and over a width of @xmath29 we find the total number of stars in the discernible stream to be @xmath30 .",
    "the large uncertainty simply reflects the poisson statistics of the very high background , ( @xmath31 field stars in the same region of color and configuration space ) .",
    "figure 4 shows a background - subtracted , longitudonal profile of the filtered star counts , normalized to yield an integrated total of 530 stars . for stars with @xmath32 and a stream width of 1.0 ,",
    "the average surface density is @xmath33 stars deg@xmath34 , with a peak of over 100 stars deg@xmath34 .",
    "like the pal 5 and gd-1 streams , the ebs profile shows interesting peaks and troughs , fairly regularly spaced with a separation of @xmath35 . while the uncertainties are large , the clumps and gaps that give rise to these features appear quite obvious in figure 1 .",
    "the regular spacing may suggest an origin tied to the orbit of the stream , perhaps a result of episodic stripping ( e.g. major stripping pulses at the perigalacticon of a highly eccentric orbit @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the undulations may be due to scattering by encounters with massive objects in the disk or halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently detected a number of cold halo substructures in velocity space ( `` echos '' ) using segue data .",
    "with a plate center at ( r.a . , dec )",
    "= ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , their b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 detection overlaps the ebs ( figure 5 ) and the estimated distance of 10 kpc is almost identical to what we find for the stream .",
    "we have examined this region using isochrone filters with [ fe / h ] ranging from -2.2 to 0.0 and find no evidence for other cold substructures at this distance .",
    "we conclude that b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 is most likely sampling stars in the ebs stream .",
    "@xcite find a mean radial velocity for b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 of 71 km s@xmath38 , and a dispersion of 13 km s@xmath38 .",
    "this dispersion is significantly larger than that measured for known and presumed globular cluster streams @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is quite similar to measurements of presumed dwarf galaxy streams @xcite . combining the width of the stream with its large apparent velocity dispersion",
    ", we might infer that the stream s progenitor was substantially more massive than pal 5 or the globular clusters that produced gd-1 , acheron , cocytos , or lethe . on the other hand ,",
    "the stream is neither as broad nor as populous as streams associated with classical dwarf galaxies like sagittarius or the progenitor of the orphan stream",
    ". the high velocity dispersion may be partly due to non - ebs stars in the sample , or it may be due to heating of the progenitor by disk or perigalactic shocking prior to the stripping of these stars",
    ". it may also be due to significant heating by encounters with either dark matter subhalos @xcite or massive structures ( e.g. giant molecular clouds ) in the disk .",
    "another possibility is that the ebs may be the remnant of an ultrafaint dwarf galaxy @xcite , though as we discuss below , it is difficult to imagine how such an object could have retained a dark matter envelope for any length of time .",
    "figure 5 shows an expanded , lower - contrast view of the southern portion of the ebs . with a contrast maximum at the same distance ( @xmath39 kpc ) as the ebs is an interesting and relatively compact feature at [ r.a .",
    ", dec ] @xmath40 .",
    "the object contains @xmath41 stars to @xmath42 , has a filtered star count density higher than any visible portion of the ebs , and appears quite distinct within the stream .",
    "there are several background galaxy clusters identified within @xmath19 of this position , but examination of the identically filtered sdss dr7 galaxy catalog shows no significant galaxy concentration of similar size or shape .",
    "two lesser peaks are apparent some @xmath15 north and south of this object ( see also figure 4 ) , but we focus on this object because it is the most prominant and populous concentration , both to the eye and in the longitudonal profile .    given its apparent location at the same distance as the stream and approximately centered within it , we infer that the feature is physically associated with the ebs and we designate it hydra i. the feature appears somewhat amorphous , with two primary concentrations extending to the north and west , respectively , for a total extent of @xmath43 . at 9.7 kpc this corresponds to a spatial extent of about @xmath44 pc , which is far larger than any known globular cluster . using filter shifts",
    "to estimate relative distances , we find that the maximum filtered surface densities in the two lobes of hydra i occur within 0.1 magnitudes of one another , indicating that hydra i is not significantly extended along our line of sight . at 9.7 kpc",
    ", 0.1 magnitudes corresponds to a difference in distance of 500 pc . to within the uncertainties ,",
    "this is identical to the lateral extent of the object .    how real is the apparent , double - lobed morphology of hydra i ?",
    "could the northeastern lobe be simply a chance consequence of poisson statistics ?",
    "the surface density profile of stars with @xmath45 in the stronger , western lobe and lying within 0.2 magnitudes of the z=0.0003 ischrone in @xmath46 is shown in figure 6 .",
    "fitting an elliptical @xmath47 model to the star counts , we find ellipticity @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ( measured north through east ) , a total population out to @xmath19 of @xmath50 stars , and an overall @xmath51 of 1.2 .",
    "following @xcite , we then determine the fractional r.m.s .",
    "deviation @xmath52total of the data compared to the model .",
    "we generate 1000 poisson realizations of the field out to @xmath19 and examine the distribution of ( @xmath53/total)@xmath54 . the peak of the distribution differs from 0 at the @xmath55 level , indicating that the northeastern lobe is unlikely to be a statistical departure from the model .",
    "we can only speculate as to the relationship between the two lobes at this point .",
    "however , being part of a tidal stream , it seems reasonable to suppose that the two lobes are unbound , comoving tidal remnants .",
    "deeper imaging of hydra i is currently being acquired and will be the subject of a future contribution .",
    "@xcite detected a velocity overdensity among metal poor stars at [ r.a .",
    ", dec ] = [ @xmath56 that they attributed to the monoceros ring .",
    "figure 5 shows that the stars making up their b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 detection clearly sample the position of hydra i , as well as a portion of the ebs extending to the south ( which would be expected to have a nearly identical velocity ) .",
    "their estimated distance of 9.7 kpc is identical with the values we find above .",
    "filtering this region of dr7 using isochrones with metallicities spanning the range @xmath57 [ fe / h]@xmath58 reveals no other significant structures at this position .",
    "we conclude that @xcite actually sampled the stars in hydra i and the ebs .",
    "they find a mean velocity for b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 of 85 km s@xmath38 and a dispersion of 14.9 km s@xmath38 .",
    "the velocity dispersion is again quite high compared with globular clusters or ultrafaint galaxies , suggesting that hydra i was either quite massive or has been significantly heated over time .",
    "based on velocity dispersion , @xcite have suggested that the progenitors of their echos were dwarf spheroidal galaxies . however , based on the the orbit constraints below , the high velocity dispersions of the ebs and hydra i may be due to significant heating by encounters with the dark matter subhalos @xcite or massive star clusters or molecular clouds in the disk .",
    "mindful of the fact that tidal streams do not precisely trace the orbits of their progenitors @xcite , we nevertheless estimate the orbit of the _ stream _ stars to determine whether the ebs might be related to any of the other streams in figure 1 .",
    "we do this using the galactic model of @xcite to compute trial orbit integrations , and matching these orbit integrations with the measured positions , distances , and velocities of the stream in a least - squares sense .",
    "we integrate orbits over a grid of possible radial velocities and proper motions , using the idl amoeba downhill simplex procedure to find the minimum @xmath51 at each grid point .",
    "the grid points are separated by 1 km s@xmath38 in radial velocity , and 0.02 mas yr@xmath38 in each component of proper motion .",
    "we fit to 17 normal points chosen to lie along the estimated centerline of the stream .",
    "we use a solar galactocentric distance of 8.5 kpc , and stream distances and velocities as given above .",
    "we adopt velocity uncertainties for the measurements at b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 and b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 of 3 km s@xmath38 ( schlaufman , private communication ) , positional uncertainties of @xmath59 , and distance uncertainties as given above .",
    "we have attempted to measure the proper motions along the stream using the proper motions provided in dr7 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively large uncertainties and severe contamination by field stars conspire to wash out any obvious signal due to the stream .",
    "we consequently leave the proper motions as free parameters in the fit .",
    "tighter constrains on the orbit will have to await the acqusition of more accurate proper motions with gaia or the large synoptic survey telescope .",
    "figure 7 shows the normal points used to fit the postions along the ebs stream .",
    "also shown are projections of the best - fit orbits on the sdss dr7 footprint .",
    "both the prograde and retrograde orbit models predict that the stream passes between 1 and 2 kpc of the current position of the sun , near the north galactic pole in projection . at this distance",
    ", the stream would be more than @xmath60 across , and moving between three and four times faster than at apogalacticon .",
    "if the stellar stream extends along these portions of the orbits , and if the number of stars stripped from the progenitor per unit time was roughly constant over the lifetime of the stream , then we would expect the surface density near the north galactic pole to be @xmath61 times less than it is in figure 1 .",
    "since we expect the rate of tidal stripping to accelerate as the mass of the progenitor is diminished over time , the relative number of stream stars we might expect to see far from the progenitor would be reduced further still . if the orbit is retrograde , then the star count signal of the ebs would likely be buried within the much more populous sagittarius stream .",
    "if there are ebs stars passing near the sun , they will more easily be found in velocity and proper motion surveys ( e.g. rave , gaia , lsst ) .",
    "figure 8 shows orbit integrations that correspond to the best - fit parameters for both prograde and retrograde models .",
    "while the formal @xmath51 for the retrograde model is 15% less than that for the prograde model , the disagreement between the predicted velocity gradient along the stream ( 3.1 km s@xmath38 deg@xmath38 ) and the measurements at b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 and b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 ( -4.8 km s@xmath38 deg@xmath38 ) is somewhat larger ( and of the opposite sign ) than for the prograde model ( -10.7 km s@xmath38 deg@xmath38 ) .",
    "additional velocity measurements at different positions along the stream and/or proper motion measurements will be required to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "the proper motions predicted at the position of hydra i are @xmath62 mas yr@xmath38 , @xmath63 mas yr@xmath38 for the prograde orbit , and @xmath64 mas yr@xmath38 , @xmath65 mas yr@xmath38 for the retrograde orbit .",
    "these values are of the same magnitude or less than the typical dr7 uncertainties ( @xmath66 mas yr@xmath67 ) , so it is perhaps not surprizing that we have been unable to identify a clear stream signature in the proper motion data .",
    "the prograde orbit model predicts apogalacticon r@xmath68 kpc , perigalacticon r@xmath69 kpc , eccentricity @xmath70 , and inclination @xmath71 , where the uncertainties correspond to the 90% joint confidence interval . for the retrograde orbit ,",
    "the parameters are r@xmath72 kpc , r@xmath73 kpc , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . in either case",
    ", the ebs appears to be on a fairly eccentric orbit .",
    "this eccentricity is forced entirely by the curvature of the stream at its northern end .",
    "if we give zero weight to the b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 and b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 velocities , the best - fitting orbit still predicts an eccentricity of @xmath76 .",
    "the stream is evidently not associated with either the acs or the monoceros ring , both of which have been determined to be on very nearly circular orbits @xcite .",
    "the combination of inclination and eccentricity takes the stream into the inner , non - spherical part of the galactic potential , where no component of angular momentum is conserved and we see an interesting box orbit as a consequence .",
    "frequent , oblique passages through the disk would presumably increase the potential for encounters with massive structures such as stellar clusters or giant molecular clouds and may be partly or wholly responsible for the high velocity dispersion observed in the hydra i and the ebs stream .",
    "the ebs stream adds to the growing list of halo streams that can be mapped over a sufficient extent that , with suitable follow - up observations , they could be used as probes of the galactic potential .",
    "a preliminary orbit estimate shows that the ebs is unrelated to either the anticenter or monoceros streams .",
    "the somewhat intermediate breadth of the stream together with its relatively high velocity dispersion suggests the possibility that the progenitor could have been more massive than the globular clusters thought to be responsible for the half dozen very cold streams discovered in the sdss footprint to date .",
    "however , if the progenitor had been a dark matter dominated dwarf galaxy , it would be difficult to understand how it could have held onto it s dark matter envelope for any length of time in such a confined and eccentric orbit .",
    "on the other hand , this very orbit may have subjected both the progenitor and the stream to significant heating through encounters with massive structures in the disk .",
    "if hydra i is indeed the progenitor of the ebs , then it is only the second probably unbound progenitor to be associated with a tidal stream .",
    "a more detailed examination of the structure and stellar kinematics in this remnant may shed new light on the end stage of tidal disruption .",
    "though contamination by field stars is high , hydra i may be particularly attractive in this respect as it is four times closer to us than bootes iii @xcite",
    ".    refinement of the orbit will require radial velocity and proper motion measurements of carefully selected stars along the length of the stream .",
    "given the very low surface density of stream stars and very high field star contamination , this will necessarily be an ongoing task . in this respect",
    ", the ebs may be particularly well situated for follow - up by the upcoming spectroscopic lamost survey .",
    "gaia and lsst proper motion measurements may also help us to refine the orbit and perhaps trace the stream over a much longer arc .",
    "the author is grateful to an anonymous referee for constructive and insightful comments .",
    "thanks also go to kevin schlaufman for providing the positions of echos member stars .",
