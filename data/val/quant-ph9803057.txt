    "the design of strategies able to protect the evolution of a quantum system against the irreversible corruption due to environmental noise represents a challenging conceptual issue . in particular , since maintaining quantum coherence is a crucial requirement for exploiting the novel possibilities opened up by quantum parallelism , practical implementations of quantum computation and communication proposals require methods to effectively resist the action of quantum decoherence and dissipation @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , two classes of procedures are available to overcome the decoherence problem : either passive stabilization or active manipulation of the quantum state . the first kind of solutions , recently formalized as _ error - avoiding codes _",
    "@xcite , relies on the existence of a subspace of states that , owing to special symmetry properties , are dynamically decoupled from the environment .",
    "the second approach , pionereed in @xcite and closer in spirit to quantum control theory @xcite , embraces today a variety of sophisticated schemes known as _ error - correcting codes _ @xcite .",
    "basically , loss of information is corrected by monitoring the system and conditionally carrying on suitable feedback operations .    in this work",
    "we investigate a third strategy for reducing noise and decoherence . this strategy , which can be termed quantum `` bang - bang '' control after its classical analog @xcite , works by averaging out the unwanted effects of the environmental interaction through the application of suitable open - loop control techniques on the system .",
    "the basic idea is that open - system properties , specifically decoherence , may be modified if a time - varying control field acts on the dynamics of the system over time scales that are comparable to the memory time of the environment . in particular , we work out an exact model for a two - state quantum system ( _ qubit _ ) coupled to a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators , where decoherence is dynamically suppressed through repeated effective time - reversal operations on the combined system @xmath0 bath .",
    "although the phenomenon is mathematically reminiscent of the quantum zeno effect @xcite , the essential physical idea comes from refocusing techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( nmr ) @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of spin echoes in 1950 @xcite , clever pulse methods have been developed in nmr to eliminate much of the dephasing arising from variations in the local magnetic field acting on each spin . because the latter effect can be thought in terms of an interaction with some classical environment , it is not obvious _ a priori _ whether similar techniques work in the presence of a quantum mechanical environment and purely nonclassical effects like entanglement .",
    "our result answers this question in the affirmative , and points out the role of the reservoir correlation time as a further parameter to be engineered in the struggle for preserving quantum coherence .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii , a general model of a two - state system interacting with a thermal environment is reviewed and its decoherence properties in the absence of control recalled . in section iii , the evolution under the action of a sequence of perturbative kicks is analyzed .",
    "complete quenching of decoherence is established as a limiting situation . in section iv ,",
    "the conditions for an effective decoherence reduction are clarified with reference to a variety of possible environmental configurations and the method is compared to different quantum error - correction techniques .",
    "we close by discussing possibilities for future work .",
    "our goal is to investigate how decoherence properties of an open quantum system may be modified through the application of an external controllable interaction .",
    "decoherence is a process whereby quantum systems lose their ability to exhibit coherent behavior such as interference @xcite .",
    "we start by introducing a model that allows investigation of the problem in its simplest nontrivial configuration .",
    "the physical system we are interested in is a single two - state quantum system , representing the elementary memory cell of quantum information ( qubit ) .",
    "although not strictly necessary , it will be convenient to think of the physical qubit as realized by a spin-@xmath1 system , which will provide us with direct reference to the well established language of nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and the rapidly growing field of nmr quantum computation @xcite .",
    "decoherence arises due to the coupling to a quantized environment , here schematized as a continuum of harmonic modes .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the overall qubit @xmath0 bath is ruled by the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 where the first and second contribution @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe , respectively , the free evolution of the qubit and the environment , and the third term @xmath5 describes a bilinear interaction between the two .",
    "@xmath6 is the standard diagonal pauli matrix , with qubit basis states denoted as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , while @xmath9 are bosonic operators for the @xmath10 field mode , characterized by a generally complex coupling parameter @xmath11 . in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "the state of the combined system @xmath12 is represented by a density operator @xmath13 and the reduced qubit dynamics is thereupon recovered from a partial trace over the environment degrees of freedom : @xmath14 hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which corresponds to a special case of the so - called spin - boson problem @xcite , has been used by many authors to model decoherence in quantum computers @xcite . in particular , we adhere closely to the notations of @xcite .",
    "the basic fact about the dynamics induced by ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is that , since @xmath15=0 $ ] , the interaction with the environment has the two memory states @xmath16 as eigenstates . in other words ,",
    "the model describes a purely decohering mechanism , where no energy exchange between qubit and bath is present . in nmr terminology",
    ", this implies that no @xmath17-type of decay takes place @xcite .",
    "equivalently , in terms of errors , only phase errors are introduced . however , neglecting the effects associated to quantum dissipation is justified , in a sense , by two related reasons : energy exchange processes not only produces amplitude errors which need to be corrected even in the classical computation , but they typically involve time scales much longer than decoherence mechanisms . in addition , being exactly soluble , the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has the advantage of allowing a clear picture of the decoherence properties in the absence of control . to this end , since spin populations are not affected by the environment , the relevant quantity is the qubit coherence @xmath18 ( of course , @xmath19 )",
    ".    it will be convenient to move to the interaction picture associated to the free dynamics @xmath20 , corresponding to the transformed state vector @xmath21 and to the effective hamiltonian @xmath22 time evolution is determined by the time - ordered unitary operator @xmath23 which can be evaluated exactly and can be written , up to a global @xmath24-number phase factor , in the following form : @xmath25 where the following complex function has been introduced : @xmath26 note that the separate dependence of ( [ timeop1 ] ) on both initial time @xmath27 and evolution interval @xmath28 is consistent with the time - reversal property @xmath29 . a nice discussion on the entanglement generated by @xmath30 between qubit and field states is given in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in calculating @xmath31 this can be done without approximations under two standard assumptions :    @xmath32 qubit and environment are initially uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath33 @xmath34 the environment is initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ thermal ] ) , @xmath37 , being @xmath38 the boltzmann constant . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose henceforth units such that @xmath39 . conditions ( [ factorized])-([thermal ] ) are easily translated to interaction picture and , inserting ( [ timeop1 ] ) into ( [ rho01 ] ) , the problem is reduced to a single - mode trace : @xmath40 where , in the first equality , the harmonic displacement operator @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 and the second equality defines the time - dependent function @xmath43 .",
    "the final step is to recognize that , for each mode , the quantity in curly brackets in ( [ singletrace ] ) is nothing but the symmetric order generating function for a thermal harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "thus , the explicit expression for @xmath43 is @xmath44 being @xmath45 a real function , it correponds to pure damping in ( [ singletrace ] ) .",
    "accordingly , this function characterizes completely the dynamics of the decoherence process destroying the qubit phase information .",
    "of course , the complete evolution in the original schrdinger picture includes oscillation at the natural frequency @xmath46 , @xmath47 while , using ( [ timeop1 ] ) , one can check that @xmath48 , @xmath8 .",
    "deeper insight into the time dependence of the decoherence process is gained if the continuum limit is made explicit in ( [ gamma0 ] ) . by substituting @xmath49 through ( [ csi ] )",
    ", we get @xmath50\\ , 4 \\coth\\bigg ( { \\omega \\over 2 t } \\bigg )   { 1-\\cos \\omega(t - t_0 ) \\over \\omega^2 } \\;. \\label{spectral}\\ ] ] the quantity in square brackets is known as the spectral density @xmath51 of the bath .",
    "it turns out that , once the initial state is specified , complete information about the effect of the environment is encapsulated in this single function . as a general feature , the spectral density is characterized by a certain ultraviolet cut - off frequency @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "although the specific value of @xmath52 depends on a natural cut - off frequency varying from system to system , the existence of a finite @xmath52 is always demanded on physical grounds . indeed , assuming that the environment does not have a high frequency cut - off means , generally , that energy can be dissipated instantaneously @xcite .",
    "if , for instance , decoherence arises from the coupling to a phonon field , the natural cut - off frequency can be identified with the debye frequency . in general",
    ", @xmath55 sets the fastest time scale ( or the memory time ) of the environment .",
    "when a specific choice will be useful , we will assume a spectral density with the following functional form : @xmath56 the parameter @xmath57 measuring ( in suitable units ) the strength of the system - bath coupling and the index @xmath58 classifying different environment behaviors @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath59 , another time scale @xmath60 , associated with the temperature of the bath , is expected to play a major role in the evolution of the qubit coherence .",
    "this is manifest if eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) is written in the equivalent form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the average number of field excitations at temperature @xmath35 . in this way , effects due to the thermal noise are formally separated from the ones due to purely vacuum fluctuations .",
    "because of the different frequency composition , the two kinds of fluctuations dominate on different time scales , the relative importance of vacuum to thermal contributions being determined by @xmath63 .",
    "this multiplicity of time scales is one of the factors that makes the decoherence process quite complicated .",
    "it should be important to keep in mind that there is _ no _ generic decohering behavior , and in particular that the qubit dynamics depends crucially on both temperature and the details of the spectral function @xmath51 .",
    "we will comment further on this point later .",
    "let us now define a procedure aimed at modifying the decoherence properties discussed so far .",
    "we choose to implement it as a suitable perturbation acting on some observables @xmath64 of system @xmath65 .",
    "this is obtained by adding to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) a time - dependent term @xmath66 , where the input functions @xmath67 are assumed to be programmable at will , e.g. a given schedule of time - varying magnetic fields in the case of a spin - qubit . in control terminology , this realizes a so - called open - loop configuration @xcite . closed - loop ( or feedback ) configurations have been also proposed in recent years to manipulate decoherence in some quantum optical systems @xcite .",
    "there are many possible choices for the control hamiltonian .",
    "leaving aside the problem of controllability of the system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) at the abstract level , we make here a pragmatic choice , partly suggested by semiclassical considerations .",
    "suppose that the perturbation we add is able to induce spin - flip transitions .",
    "by inspection of the spin - bath interaction hamiltonian @xmath5 , opposite contributions arise when the spin belongs to the down or up eigenstate .",
    "since a relative minus sign will be present during time evolution , the effect of the @xmath5 coupling will eventually average out provided the spin is flipped rapidly enough .",
    "there are two reasons why a mechanism of this kind is expected to be possible .",
    "first , as we already mentioned , similar methods are routinely used in nmr experiments to get rid of the effects of some unwanted interactions @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the so - called spin - flip narrowing , line broadening resulting from magnetic dipolar coupling is reduced by repetitively flipping the spins among distinct energy configurations .",
    "the major difference here is that the undesired decohering coupling is contributed by the infinitely - many quantized degrees of freedom of the heat bath .",
    "the second reason is related to the finite response time @xmath59 of the environment itself . in general ,",
    "if perturbations act on the system more rapidly than this fastest time scale present in the bath , we expect that memory effects would be relevant , and that this non - markovian dynamics would eventually lead to modified decoherence properties .",
    "having anticipated the intuitive idea , we start by writing the total hamiltonian as @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents a monochromatic alternating magnetic field applied at resonance . at this level , the problem can be related to variants of the complete spin - boson model , none of them is exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "the main simplification we introduce is to substitute the continuous - mode operation , where the actions of the bath and the controlling field are necessarily simultaneous , with a pulsed - mode operation analogous to classical `` bang - bang '' control .",
    "then , under the working assumption that the typical decoherence time of the system and the duration of pulses define two widely different time scales , we solve the problem by putting    @xmath32 @xmath70 within each pulse ;    @xmath34 @xmath71 between successive pulses .    as usual ,",
    "we invoke the rotating wave approximation and only look at the co - rotating component of the rf - field .",
    "the radiofrequency perturbation is assumed of the following form : @xmath72 \\ ; ,   \\label{rf}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 eqs .",
    "( [ rf])-([v ] ) schematize a sequence of @xmath76 identical pulses , each of duration @xmath77 , applied at instants @xmath78 .",
    "the separation @xmath79 between pulses is assumed to be an input of the model .",
    "the amplitude of the field is equal to @xmath80 during each pulse and will be further specified below together with @xmath77 . in order to depict the evolution associated to a given pulse sequence , it is convenient to think the latter as formed by successive elementary cycles of spin - flips , a complete cycle being able to return the spin back to the starting configuration .",
    "we begin by analyzing the time evolution during the first spin cycle .",
    "* a. the elementary spin - flip cycle *    as in sec .",
    "ii , we exploit the interaction representation ( [ interaction ] ) .",
    "some instructive steps of an alternative derivation based on heisenberg formalism are sketched in the appendix .",
    "the interaction picture transformed hamiltonian is now @xmath81 where @xmath82 is given in ( [ effective ] ) , and @xmath83 is evaluated by using ( [ rf ] ) and the properties of pauli matrices .",
    "we get @xmath84 according to ( [ rftilde ] ) , the time dependence due to the rotating field is completely removed within each pulse .",
    "in fact , the interaction representation ( [ interaction ] ) on spin variables is identical , at resonance , with the description in the rotating frame associated to ( [ rf ] ) @xcite .",
    "the counter - rotating term that is omitted within rwa is seen to be negligible at resonance .",
    "for the first spin cycle , @xmath85 and we have the following sequence : evolution under @xmath82 during @xmath86 ; pulse @xmath87 at time @xmath88 ; evolution under @xmath82 during @xmath89 ; pulse @xmath90 at time @xmath91 . after a total time @xmath92 ,",
    "the first cycle is complete . in terms of evolution operators",
    ", we have : @xmath93 \\big [ \\tilde{u}_{tot}(t_0,t^{(1)}_p ) \\big ] \\;.   \\label{timeop2}\\ ] ] we can read the evolutions in the absence of rf - field directly from ( [ timeop1 ] ) , for instance @xmath94 concerning the evolution operator associated to the generic @xmath95 pulse , this is found by exponentiating ( [ rftilde ] ) ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 in order to proceed , we have to say more about pulses .",
    "we require @xmath98 = 0 \\ ; ,   \\label{pulses}\\ ] ] @xmath99 and @xmath100 $ ] denoting anticommutator and commutator respectively .",
    "these conditions imply , as expected from the intuitive explanation , that @xmath101 are @xmath102-pulses , satisfying @xmath103 . to simplify things",
    ", we imagine that @xmath83 is large enough to produce ( almost ) instantaneous spin - flips .",
    "accordingly , @xmath104 henceforth and we have to deal with ideal `` kicks '' of infinite power .",
    "putting things together , we find @xmath105 @xmath106 and we are therefore ready to write down the final result for the cycle evolution operator : @xmath107 where , as before , @xmath24-number phase factors have been omitted and @xmath108 it is interesting to compare the evolution described by ( [ pulsed ] ) with the one in the absence of pulses . by recalling ( [ timeop1 ] ) , evaluated at time @xmath109 , we report two differencies : a phase factor proportional to @xmath6 and the duration of the cycle ; a combination @xmath110 in place of @xmath111 .",
    "the first difference corresponds to the fact that , due to the pulses , the oscillation at the natural frequency @xmath46 is lost once the evolution is transferred back to schrdinger picture ( see ( [ lab ] ) ) .",
    "the second difference , as it will be seen in a moment , is the signal that decoherence properties are modified .    * b. decoherence properties after a pulse sequence *    the next step is to generalize the description to an arbitrary number @xmath112 of elementary spin - flip cycles , the @xmath113 cycle ending at time @xmath114 and the number of @xmath102-pulses involved in the sequence being @xmath115 .",
    "this is straight forward since eq .",
    "( [ pulsed ] ) enables us to write down the evolution operator for the @xmath113 cycle : @xmath116 the time development corresponding to @xmath112 cycles is then governed by the time - ordered finite product @xmath117 note that , at variance with conventional spin - flip narrowing @xcite , @xmath118 , the dependence on intermediate times @xmath119 in the sequence being introduced by the environment dynamics . a closed formula for @xmath120 can still be found quickly since , by neglecting state - independent global phase factors that are irrelevant to density matrix propagation , we are allowed to treat the factors in ( [ finitep ] ) as commuting operators .",
    "we get @xmath121 where @xmath122 and definition ( [ endtime ] ) has been exploited . of course , the results of sec .",
    "iiia are recovered for @xmath123 .",
    "a more interesting check can be done by relating the evolution ( [ sequence ] ) to the corresponding propagator in the absence of pulses .",
    "the trick is to switch back the minus sign in the definition ( [ eta ] ) of @xmath124 , that has been recognized as the key dynamical effect due to the pulsing procedure . since @xmath125 , we are left with @xmath126 in place of ( [ etak ] ) .",
    "therefore , this procedure gives @xmath127 which does agree with the direct evaluation based on ( [ timeprod ] ) .",
    "it may be worth some times to let the connection with unperturbed evolution be explicit , which is done by writing @xmath128 where the contribution due to the pulse sequence shows up in the form of a typical interference factor .",
    "the decoherence properties corresponding to the pulsed qubit @xmath0 bath evolution ( [ sequence ] ) are derived through the steps outlined in sec .",
    "ii for the unperturbed case .",
    "incidentally , we still expect that spin populations are unchanged after a sequence of @xmath112 complete spin cycles , while qubit coherence at final time @xmath129 is given by @xmath130 the result is @xmath131 where @xmath132 comparing with ( [ gamma0 ] ) , the mathematical prescription for decoherence in the presence of pulses looks very simple : just use @xmath133 instead of @xmath134 for each mode of the bath . however , the final effect leading to ( [ gammap ] ) is not easy to figure out and it is useful to compare first the decoherence due to a single mode with frequency @xmath135 with and without pulses respectively .",

    "the function @xmath141 , instead , is strongly oscillating for increasing @xmath112 , developing @xmath142 local minima and a sharply - peaked absolute maximum at @xmath143 .",
    "constructive interference is highest at the maximum , leading to a value @xmath144 that can be very large , while destructive interference strongly damps the function for @xmath145 , which is a zero for both @xmath141 and @xmath138 for any @xmath112 .",
    "one can show that @xmath146 \\text { for any } n\\;. \\label{diff}\\ ] ] back to decoherence properties , condition ( [ diff ] ) means that , for a mode at frequency @xmath135 , a finite region @xmath147 exists , where the contribution to decoherence is _ smaller _ in the presence of pulses .",
    "since the `` correcting region '' is entered for small @xmath79 values , this effect takes place in the regime of rapid flipping we expected . since , moreover , smaller @xmath79 values require longer pulse sequences in order to evolve the system over the same interval , it is useful to consider an interesting limiting case .",
    "* c. the limit of continuous flipping and suppression of decoherence *    let us study an idealized situation represented by the following mathematical limit : @xmath148 it is convenient to rewrite the decoherence function ( [ gammap ] ) by exploiting ( [ eta2 ] ) to separate formally the unperturbed and the interference contributions .",
    "thus @xmath149 where @xmath150 in this way , @xmath151 is recovered by putting @xmath152 for each mode , see ( [ gamma0 ] ) .",
    "we evaluate the asymptotic limit of @xmath153 as follows : @xmath154 = \\ , 1 \\;. \\label{limit2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if this result holds for an arbitrary field mode , then the implications for the decoherence properties are transparent : @xmath155 i.e. in the limit of continuous flipping , decoherence is completely and exactly eliminated for any temperature and any spectral density function .",
    "obviously , there is no hope that a continuous limit of this kind would be ever attained in practice .",
    "however , situation ( [ limit ] ) should be approached if @xmath79 is made small compared to the fastest characteristic time present in the dynamics of the system . from the considerations of sec .",
    "ii , the environment correlation time @xmath59 certainly provides a lower bound since there is no spectral content of the environmental noise at frequency higher than @xmath52 .",
    "hence , we expect that a sufficient condition in order to meet ( [ limit ] ) is @xmath156 the question on whether we can do better than this may be not completely obvious , since time scales different from @xmath59 are also involved in the decoherence process . in what follows , we try to understand this point both by presenting a physical explanation for the decoherence suppression and by analyzing some specific situations .    * d. physical interpretation *    people familiar with quantum zeno effect @xcite may have found some similarities with the behavior we are discussing . in particular , the basic mathematical modification associated with pulses is a function @xmath157 , which is o@xmath158 for short time intervals , compared to @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , ( [ limit ] ) is formally the same continuous limit involved in many quantum zeno related proposals , notably the one by cook @xcite . in both cases , a preexisting dynamics - the qubit @xmath0 bath evolution here , a stimulated two - level transition in cook s scheme - is modified through a pulsing procedure .",
    "pulses respectively represent spin - flip interactions , short enough that the action of the bath is made negligible , or measurement pulses , long enough that the coupling to the external environment ( the measuring apparatus ) is made appreciable .",
    "a dynamical inhibition phenomenon occurs when pulses become sufficiently frequent .",
    "one can say that two opposite configurations are realized for decoherence : with continuous measurements , the interaction with the bath is always `` on '' and internal dynamics becomes frozen ; in the limit of continuous flipping , it is the two - level controlled dynamics that dominates , and the interaction with the bath tends to be always `` off '' , as indicated by ( [ suppress ] ) .",
    "however , the analogy stops from a more physical point of view .",
    "a more interesting interpretation of the decoherence suppression ( [ suppress ] ) can be obtained by connecting it to effects already observed in magnetic resonance experiments , like spin - echoes , solid - echoes , or spin - flip narrowing @xcite .",
    "all of these are basically time - reversal experiments . in order to capture the basic physical mechanism of our model ,",
    "let us go back to the elementaty spin - cycle ( sec .",
    "iiia ) and look more carefully at the evolution operator ( [ timeop2 ] ) .",
    "this is made of two pieces : a free evolution during the first @xmath79 , followed by an evolution governed by ( [ transformed ] ) during the second interval @xmath79 .",
    "it is this transformed operator that _ simulates _ the effect of a time - reversal .",
    "in fact , backward propagation during the second part of the cycle would correspond to @xmath160 by comparison with ( [ transformed ] ) , forward propagation in the presence of rf - kicks only differs for an additional term @xmath161 affecting each mode .",
    "this phase factor , due to the dynamics of the bath oscillators , is ultimately responsible for the decoherence properties in the pulsed evolution of the system . if not for this phase difference between ( [ transformed ] ) and ( [ back ] ) , we would have @xmath162 and no decoherence . instead ,",
    "reversal is approximate since the bath restarts at time @xmath163 after the first pulse with a dephased initial condition ( see also appendix ) .",
    "however , if @xmath164 for each mode , then the couple of kicks produces an exact time - reversal and , by iteration , we arrive at ( [ suppress ] ) .",
    "equivalently , if the bath hamiltonian can be considered as a constant , then the total hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) acquires a minus sign and the system retraces the previous evolution .",
    "the validity of this condition depends on the time scale we are considering . for a single mode of frequency @xmath135 , the time needed to produce appreciable dephasing is @xmath165 , so we expect decoherence correction for @xmath166 .",
    "this is in agreement with both the interpretation of ( [ diff ] ) and the semiclassical nmr argument @xcite , where motional effects are predicted for @xmath167 comparable to the mean time spent in a given spin configuration ( here @xmath79 ) . for the whole environment ,",
    "the correlation time @xmath59 is the minimum time scale over which the dynamics is approximately unchanged , and the same reasoning leads to a physical explanation of the rapid flipping condition ( [ condition ] ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we point out that the mechanism accomplishing time - reversal in our model is purely _ macroscopic _ in the sense that no reference is made to the dynamical state of the system .",
    "this is different from the familiar case of the maxwell demon , that effectively reverses a dynamical evolution by operating over some microscopic variables ( like velocities ) at a given instant .",
    "rather , the reversal is obtained by changing the sign of the system hamiltonian through the action of suitable external fields ( control ) .",
    "a different kind of demon , the so - called loschmidt demon , has been introduced by some authors to account for this behavior @xcite . in this terminology",
    ", the spin - flip procedure realizes in principle a loschmidt demon for a decohering qubit .",
    "in this section we try to give some semiquantitative picture of the decoherence mechanisms discussed so far .",
    "we focus our attention on a representative class of reservoirs , corresponding to so - called ohmic environments .",
    "the appropriate spectral density is given by ( [ density ] ) with @xmath168 .",
    "the time dependence of the decoherence is summarized by the following expression : @xmath169 where we assume @xmath170 .",
    "( [ ohmic ] ) reproduces the unperturbed behavior of sec .",
    "ii when @xmath171 , in which case @xmath172 , eq .",
    "( [ gamma0 ] ) . in the presence of @xmath112 spin - flip cycles , eq .",
    "( [ ohmic ] ) is found from the continuous limit of @xmath173 in ( [ gammap ] ) , with @xmath174 given by ( [ fk ] ) . according to sect .",
    "iii , in this case we are interested at decoherence after a complete pulse sequence , i.e. @xmath175 . for a fixed strength @xmath176 of the system - reservoir coupling , the properties of the environment enter ( [ ohmic ] ) with two parameters , @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",
    "let us first analyze decoherence in the absence of any correction , @xmath171 .",
    "qualitatively different behaviors arise depending on the relationship between the cut - off frequency @xmath52 and the thermal frequency @xmath179 .",
    "typically , two extreme situations are considered .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath180 : high - temperature limit or _ classical _ environment :    decoherence dynamics is relatively easy to describe in this regime since , due to the exponential dependence on the cut - off , @xmath52 is actually the only characteristic frequency accessible to the system .",
    "the environment looks classical in the sense that its quantized structure can not be appreciated compared to the thermal quantum @xmath181 .",
    "accordingly , thermal fluctuations always dominate over vacuum ones and , after a short transient o@xmath182 where decoherence is almost ineffective , dynamics becomes very fast and coherence is lost completely after a time comparable to @xmath59 . in general , one expects that in this limit equivalent results are obtained by assuming a heat bath of classical harmonic oscillators .",
    "a mixed quantum - classical derivation for a two - state open system is given for instance in @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 @xmath183 : low - temperature limit or _",
    "quantum _ environment :    in this limit a more complex interplay between thermal and vacuum effects arises .",
    "thermal fluctuations are only effective for @xmath184 and , due to the exponential suppression of @xmath185 , they are almost totally contributed by low frequency modes @xmath186 .",
    "the effects of vacuum fluctuations dominate on an intermediate region @xmath187 , a nonvanishing contribution remaining , however , at longer time scales @xmath184 .",
    "the frequency composition of the fluctuations is now less clear : while modes below the thermal threshold are still responsible for the long - time dynamics @xmath184 , frequencies in the range up to @xmath52 mostly contribute for @xmath188 but are also present beyond @xmath63 . as a consequence , even at thermal time scales @xmath189 , high frequency modes contribute appreciably to the decoherence process and characteristic times o@xmath190 are still relevant in the underlying dynamics .",
    "typical decoherence curves @xmath191 for the ohmic environment are found by numerical integration of ( [ ohmic ] ) and are shown in fig . 1 for two choices corresponding to high- and low - temperature limit , @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively .",
    "the partial contributions due to thermal and vacuum fluctuations are indicated separately where possible . in the low - temperature case , a quiet ( @xmath194 ) , a quantum ( @xmath187 ) and a thermal ( @xmath184 ) regime",
    "are easily identified in the process , as indicated above and discussed in more detail by many authors @xcite . in both configurations ,",
    "the qubit coherence decays exponentially fast once the thermal regime is well established , @xmath195 for a suitable time constant @xmath196 . in models where the decoherence rate is constant in time ,",
    "( [ tth ] ) is usually assumed as the definition of a typical decoherence time , @xmath197 . in our case , since the whole behavior of @xmath198 is required for a complete knowledge of the decoherence dynamics , the definition of a characteristic time for loss of unitarity is less clear .",
    "oversimplifying things , the situation can be summarized as follows : for both the high- and the low - temperature regimes , a characteristic time exists , indicating the departure of coherence from unity .",
    "this time is determined by the shortest between the two time scales @xmath199 .",
    "once this transient is over , the duration of the actual decoherence process is at least comparable to @xmath59 in the classical environment , and to @xmath200 in the quantum one .",
    "if this information is used as an estimate for a characteristic decoherence time , we are lead to @xmath201 for the high - temperature limit and @xmath202 for the low - temperature limit respectively . for identical values of @xmath176 and @xmath52",
    ", decoherence occurs extremely faster in the former case , as expected on intuitive grounds .",
    "we now come back to examine how decoherence is improved in the presence of spin - flip cycles . with the interference contribution",
    "@xmath203 restored in ( [ ohmic ] ) , we have calculated numerically the decoherence values obtained when a fixed time interval @xmath204 is divided in an increasing number of cycles of duration @xmath205 , i.e. @xmath206 the behavior of @xmath191 as a function of the pulse frequency @xmath207 has been studied , and the procedure repeated for different representative times . the results for the high- and low - temperature reservoirs considered above are shown in figs . 2 , 3 respectively .",
    "the unperturbed values of decoherence at the appropriate times can be read from fig .",
    "1 . we see that , as predicted by ( [ suppress ] ) , decoherence - correction starts as soon as the region @xmath208 is entered . for times short enough that @xmath209",
    ", this may by even accomplished with a single cycle . in general , once this condition is fulfilled , no further reduction of @xmath79 is demanded to evolve the system in a decoherence - free way .",
    "however , a warning also emerges from fig .",
    "3 : if flipping is not frequent enough , not only does the correction effect disappear , but decoherence can be actually made worse compared to the one in the absence of pulses .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is rooted into the interference mechanism that builds up the correction factor ( [ eta ] ) : in a sense , decoherence can be subtracted almost completely from the frequency range @xmath210 only at the expense of enhancing the decoherence contributions from modes outside that region .",
    "this intrinsic feature of the model is also relevant to understand why , despite of the differences existing between the high- and low - temperature decoherence properties , the same condition @xmath211 is required to prevent both thermal and vacuum noises .",
    "in fact , this condition comes quite natural for a classical environment , but one might at first wonder why a weaker condition @xmath212 would not suffice for the quantum case , even if the frequencies @xmath213 contain the fraction that mostly contributes at times of the order of @xmath214 .",
    "the reason for this failure is the presence of vacuum fluctuations . by satisfying condition @xmath212 , we do get rid of thermal dephasing , but we do not correct completely vacuum noise until @xmath211 . precisely , we are missing modes of intermediate frequency @xmath215 that , although of minor importance at long times , may introduce amplified decoherence contributions if not properly corrected .",
    "we conclude with a few comments on the relevance of our procedure for quantum information processing .",
    "while the idealized character of the model prevents us from a quantitative discussion of implementation criteria , we can compare with the principles underlying current quantum error - correction proposals .",
    "essentially , these are schemes to encode redundantly information in such a way that it can be restored also when errors due to external sources have occurred .",
    "the syndrome - identification and the error - correction stages may be regarded as a feedback configuration : suitable measurement protocols are required both in conventional schemes @xcite and in alternate techniques based on the quantum zeno effect @xcite , while conditional logic is exploited in the coherence - preserving routines proposed in @xcite . in any case , error - correction methods have the effect of reducing the error rate per unit time and , in order to be effective , they must be repeated at time intervals @xmath79 shorter than the typical decoherence time of the system , i.e. @xmath216 . in comparison to quantum error correction schemes ,",
    "our procedure exhibits two fundamental differences : no ancillary bits are required to store the information ; no measurements are performed . in principle , these could be advantageous features , since encoding would be more efficient and , by avoiding measurements , no slow - down of the computational speed would be introduced .",
    "in addition , rather than reducing the error rate , this method would suppress completely the error source provided the appropriate condition @xmath217 is fulfilled . from a more practical perspective , it is the accessibility of this rapid flipping limit , demanding fast and short pulses , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , that determines the viability of the procedure itself .",
    "if such requirements can be satisfied , our method might be valuable in configurations where @xmath214 tends to be shorter than @xmath59 @xcite or , even in case @xmath214 is longer compared to @xmath59 , for systems where tipping the state is easier than exploiting conventional error - correction protocols . while the existence of an interaction able to implement a not gate by inverting the state is demanded for any two - level system relevant to quantum computation , both the present technological capabilities for applying @xmath102-pulses and the relevant environmental cut - off frequencies depend considerably on the specific physical system and the mechanism responsible for decoherence .",
    "some important time scales for various prospective qubits can be found in @xcite .",
    "our work demonstrates the possibility to modify the evolution of a quantum open system through the application of an external controllable interaction .",
    "a prototype situation involving a two - level system coupled to a quantized reservoir in thermal equilibrium has been worked out in detail and dynamical suppression of quantum decoherence has been evidenced . from the perspective of quantum information , the analysis suggests a different direction compared to conventional quantum error - correction techniques , based on the idea of forcing the system into a dynamics that disturbs the decoherence process .",
    "our present study for a specific example brings up , among other issues , the question of whether similar decoherence correction mechanisms would be operating under more general conditions , including either different open system dynamics , or different control configurations , or both .",
    "in particular , an interesting possibility could emerge from examining decoherence properties within a fully quantum mechanical description where the control degrees of freedom are explicitly included and the system is driven by a quantum controller as recently proposed in @xcite .",

    "compared to the interaction picture , the heisenberg representation has two advantages : first , it does not require preliminary transformations on the state vector ; second , it gives to a certain extent a more intuitive description of the spin motion . in this appendix",
    ", we outline the evolution of the qubit coherence , by restricting ourselves to the first elementary spin - flip cycle . in the heisenberg picture ,",

    "iii , we evaluate the qubit dynamics under the separate action of the spin - bath hamiltonian @xmath5 and the radiofrequency perturbation @xmath221 .",
    "the description of a @xmath102-pulse turns out to be extremely simple in the heisenberg representation .",
