    "ti is a new state of quantum matter , and is distinct from simple metal or insulator in the sense that its bulk is insulating ( with a bulk band gap ) , while its surface ( or edge ) is metallic due to the presence of gapless surface ( edge ) states .",
    "those surface states are spin splitted but with double degeneracy at the dirac point , which is protected by the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the surface states , consisting of odd number of massless dirac cones , are robust against time - reversal - invariant perturbations and also are very different with graphene where spin degeneracy is reserved ( the concept of pseudo - spin describing the sub - lattice degeneracy is used for graphene ) . at the early stages of studies for tis , due to the absence of realistic materials ,",
    "most of the discussions were based on the model hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "however , within last couple of years , this field is strongly motivated by the discoveries of several real compounds .",
    "two - dimension ( 2d ) ti ( or called quantum spin hall insulator ) has been proposed and realized in hgte / cdte quantum well structure through varying the well thickness  @xcite .",
    "three - dimension ( 3d ) topological nature of bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 alloy has been demonstrated by fine tuning of the alloy concentration  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the bulk band gap is of the order of tens mev , too small for the potential applications . in our recent studies , however , we predicted that bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family compounds  @xcite ( i.e. , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 ) , which are well - known thermoelectric materials  @xcite , are strong topological insulators with surface states consisting of single dirac cone at the @xmath4 point .",
    "particularly , for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , a bulk band gap of 0.3 ev is predicted , much larger than the energy scale of room temperature .",
    "the compounds are stoichiometric , chemically very stable , and easy to be synthesized , and yet its surface states are very simple . the existence of such surface states in this family compounds have been experimentally confirmed on samples ranging from bulk to thin film  @xcite .",
    "more and more studies are now going on for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family compounds , quantitative studies and comparison with experiments become more and more important . on the other hand ,",
    "fully self - consistent _ ab  initio _ calculations are quite limited due to the large system size . in order to study both the bulk and the surface behavior simultaneously , which is necessary to identify its topological nature ,",
    "a large slab type supercell is needed , and heavy calculations are involved . to simplify future studies , it is therefore desirable to have a highly accurate effective hamiltonian , which will be one of the main purposes of this paper .",
    "it s well - known that the maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) method introduced by marzari and his coworkers  @xcite has played an important role in constructing the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , the algorithm involved does not hold the symmetry when the mlwf are constructed from bloch functions . to solve this problem",

    "the construction of the pawf basis and the effective hamiltonian is a post - process of _ ab  initio _ calculations .",

    "all structure parameters of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are chosen from experimental data listed in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "after completing the self - consistent _ ab  initio _ calculations , two steps are followed to construct the pawf basis and the effective hamiltonian .",
    "first we disentangle an isolated group of bands through minimizing the invariant part of the spread functional of wave functions ( @xmath42 )  @xcite . in the second step , the hilbert space of this isolated group of bands is directly projected onto atomic @xmath43 orbitals ( keeping the angular symmetry ) .",
    "finally a set of unitary rotation matrices @xmath44 can be obtained , which can be straightly used to construct the pawf and the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the details are elucidated in the following .      for a simple band insulator ,",
    "the disentangling procedure is typically not necessary , and it is straightforward to choose a set of wannier basis expanding the identical space of occupied bloch states .",
    "however , in our case , aiming to describe the electronic characters near the fermi level , both occupied and unoccupied bands are necessary , which are not detached from higher bands . by partial density of states ( pdos ) analysis , we know that the states near the fermi level mainly come from the contribution of @xmath43 orbitals of both bi and se atoms . since each atom has three @xmath43 orbitals , the total number of orbitals of interest is @xmath45 , consisting of 9 valence bands and 6 unoccupied bands . following the procedure described in mlwf  @xcite , we introduce a big enough outer energy window ( -20 ev , 20 ev ) , and a small inner windows ( -6 ev , 2 ev ) . a smooth subspace ( of n bands )",
    "can then be constructed by optimizing the spread functional , namely @xmath42 , as suggested in ref.[@xcite ] .",
    "the bloch functions @xmath46 of the isolated group of @xmath47 bands are directly projected onto the atomic @xmath43 orbitals , and the unitary rotation matrices @xmath44 can be obtained by proper orthonormalization  @xcite . with these unitary rotation matrices",
    "@xmath48 , we can obtain well - localized pawf by rotating the original bloch functions in the following way : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52=1,2 @xmath18 @xmath47 are band index , @xmath53 is the total number of @xmath54-points , @xmath55 denotes the @xmath51-th pawf orbital , which is centered at the lattice vector @xmath56 .    using the pawf as basis",
    ", the effective hamiltonian @xmath57 can be obtained correspondingly by rotating the original hamiltonian , @xmath58 because our pawf are constructed from atomic orbitals , which have atomic symmetry , we can further symmetrize the hamiltonian using their atomic characters . using fourier transformation ,",
    "the pawf effective hamiltonian in real space can be given by @xmath59 the hamiltonians at any other @xmath54-point can be now obtained by transforming @xmath60 back into @xmath54 space , @xmath61    all the hopping matrix elements in the effective hamiltonian are directly calculated via constructing the pawf .",
    "this approach differs a lot from the conventional slater - koster tb method  @xcite where hopping integrals up to certain neighbors are obtained by a fitting method .",
    "the present method has several special advantages .",
    "first , it is not necessary to maximize the localization of wannier functions ( wf ) .",
    "such step will usually break the local symmetry of wf . in our case",
    ", the wf could be constrained to satisfy local crystal symmetry , and the pawf effective hamiltonian can be symmetrized , while keeping the necessary accuracy .",
    "second , the atomic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) can be easily implemented .",
    "since the wf are constructed from atomic orbitals , they are already quite localized although not maximally localized by definition .",
    "the pawf effective hamiltonian is expected to be useful for large supercell calculations without extra errors from the symmetry problem .",
    "the soc is important for the topological nature of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family compounds , and should be included in all analysis .",
    "since soc is mostly local atomic physics and has little * k*-dependence , the simplest way to supplement soc on top of our pawf effective hamiltonian ( denoted as @xmath62 from now on ) is to include an additional local term @xmath63 in the total hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath65\\cdot { \\bf{\\sigma}}.\\ ] ] @xmath63 comes from the soc interaction , while * v * and @xmath66 represent total potential and pauli spin matrices respectively .",
    "as discussed above , our pawf are constructed from atomic @xmath43 orbitals ( having atomic angular symmetry ) , the soc hamiltonian can be straightforwardly written down , in terms of those pawf basis , @xmath67 indicates the spin . with this basis set for each atom ,",
    "@xmath63 part can be expressed as @xmath68.\\ ] ] where @xmath69 denotes the soc parameter .",
    "we take the soc parameters of bi , se , sb and te atoms from wittel s spectral data ( @xmath70 = 1.25 ev , @xmath71 = 0.22 ev , @xmath72 = 0.4 ev , @xmath73 = 0.49 ev )  @xcite .              to demonstrate the quality of the pawf effective hamiltonian , here we compare several important properties calculated from the pawf hamiltonian with that obtained from the @xmath74 calculations .",
    "the first property to be compared is the the calculated bulk band structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bandbs](a ) , for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 without soc , the band structures obtained from pawf effective hamiltonian can almost exactly reproduce the _ ab  initio _ band structures . after taking into account the soc interaction ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ bandbs](b ) ) , the quality is slightly reduced , but it is still reasonably good since only the * k*-independent soc interaction is implemented in the effective hamiltonian . for bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , the pawf effective hamiltonian show similar quality ( shown in fig .",

    "is used here .",
    "for all three systems , we calculate the parity eigenvalues of nine occupied bands and the first conduction band at the time - reversal invariant momentum ( trim ) points @xmath4 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the results for the @xmath4 point , obtained from the effective hamiltonian , are listed in table  [ parity ] . as can be clearly seen , the parity products of occupied bands are -1 for the @xmath4 points . for the other trim points , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ,",
    "the detailed numbers are not listed here , but our results give + 1 for three of the compounds . from the parity numbers , we can therefore identify the corresponding z@xmath0 invariants  @xcite as 1 for all the three compounds .",
    "this means they have nontrivial topological nature , in good agreement with our previous studies  @xcite . from above comparisons ,",
    "we conclude that the quality of the pawf effective hamiltonian is as good as that obtained from the _ ab  initio _ calculations .",
    "[ tbp ]       [ tbp ]       once the effective hamiltonian has been constructed from above procedures , we will be able to calculate the surface states of semi - infinite systems from the iterative green s function method  @xcite , as described in our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the existence of gapless spin - filter surface states is the direct manifestation of the topological nature .",
    "the crystal structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family compounds can be understood as the stacking of qls along the @xmath15 direction .",
    "the inter - layer bonding between two qls is much weaker than that inside the ql , it is natural to expect that the cleavage plane should be between two qls .",
    "this fact has been well confirmed by the recent experiments on the layer - by - layer mbe growth of ultra - thin film  @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus our studies on this type of surface termination ( with se1 atomic layer as the top most layer ) .",
    "our previous studies have shown that gapless surface states with single dirac point ( located at @xmath22 ) exist for all three compounds , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , but not for sb@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "the dispersion of surface states around dirac point is highly linear , and these surface states can be described by a simple continuous model  @xcite . here",
    ", we will not repeat those results , on the other hand however , will focus on some other details of surface states , including the penetration depth , the spin - resolved fermi surface , and the chiral spin texture of the surface states .",
    "the spread of surface states , or in other words its spacial penetration depth into the bulk , is an essential quantity for the potential applications of these surface states if any . in order to clarify this point ,",
    "a free standing slab model is constructed using our pawf effective hamiltonian .",
    "we use a slab consisting of 25 qls , which is thick enough to avoid the direct coupling between the two surfaces , i.e , the top and the bottom surfaces of the slab . in order to make the calculations more realistic",
    ", we further take into account the surface correction .",
    "the bulk pawf effective hamiltonian is used to construct the hamiltonian of the slab , however for those layers close to the surface , the on - site energies of pawf should be modified from its bulk counterparts due to the presence of vacuum ( i.e , the surface potential ) . by comparing with the fully self - consistent _ ab  initio _ calculations of thin slab , all the correction of on - site energies for pawf ( @xmath78 )",
    "can be obtained .",
    "the calculated band structures of our 25-qls bi@xmath0se@xmath1 slab along @xmath79 and @xmath80 lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ gk ] and fig .",
    "[ gm ] . clearly , within the bulk energy gap , there exist two surface bands ( marked by @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , which are degenerate at @xmath22 point ( where so called dirac cone exists ) .",
    "the two surface bands ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are sampled by several @xmath54-points ( with @xmath83 , i=1,2,3 ) .",
    "the real space distribution of eigen wave functions for those sampling @xmath54-points are plotted in fig .",
    "[ gk](b)-(c ) and fig .",
    "[ gm](b)-(c ) respectively . for those @xmath54-points close to the dirac point ( such as @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , the distribution of wave functions are very localized to the surface region , with a typical spread of about 2 qls ( about 2 nm in thickness ) . by moving away from the dirac point , the penetration depth increases , and finally for @xmath86 point , where the surface state almost merges with the bulk states , the eigen wave function becomes a extended state . for both @xmath87 and @xmath88 lines , the same behaviors are observed . to further see the oscillating behavior of surface state distribution over atomic layers",
    ", we plot the distribution for @xmath84 in the inset .",
    "finally , we can conclude that surface states are very localized to the surface region , and the penetration depth is about 2 or 3 qls .        to make further comparison , we have performed a fully self - consistent _ ab  initio _",
    "calculations for a 3-qls slab .",
    "the real space charge distribution of surface states can thus be obtained , by integrating the states within an energy window of 10 mev around the dirac point . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcharge ] , the charge distribution is really localized at the surface region . further more",
    "the charges are not centered at the atom , but rather distributed mostly between the bi and se atoms , where strong covalent bonding is expected .",
    "probing the @xmath89 berry phase enclosed by the fermi surface of surface states is one of the most direct methods to distinguish ti .",
    "now we will analyze the spin - resolved fermi surfaces around the dirac point of the semi - infinite bi@xmath0se@xmath1 system . with the green s functions calculated from the effective hamiltonian",
    ", the spin - filter surface states and the corresponding fermi surfaces can be obtained directly .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] , when the fermi level is close to the dirac point , the corresponding fermi surface is nearly a perfect circle ; while if the fermi level is away from the dirac point , the properties of the surface states are significantly affected by the bulk states and thus satisfy the crystal symmetry .",
    "for example , the fermi surface for @xmath90=0.1ev ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figfs](a ) ) looks like a small circle , while the fermi surface for @xmath90=0.25ev ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figfs](b ) ) looks like a hexagon satisfying @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "the spin orientation for states around the fermi surface is marked as well by arrows .",
    "the magnitude of the spin @xmath15 component is very small , only about @xmath91 of the in - plane component .",
    "thus the spin almost completely lies in the plane . moving around the fermi surface ,",
    "the spin orientation rotate simultaneously , forming a spin - orbit ring , which carries a @xmath89 berry phase .",
    "this signifies the topological nontrivial properties of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] , the spin orientation of the ring belongs to the left chirality ( the normal direction of the semi - infinite system is defined as z direction ) which is again one of the important manifestations of nontrivial topological characters .",
    "the gapless surface states that connect the bulk valence and conduction bands have almost linear energy dependence near the dirac point .",
    "linear band structure in 2d should lead to linear density of states ( dos ) . to be specific , in the bulk energy gap , the energy bands are mostly from the surface states , so the dos in the bulk energy gap are expected to be highly linear .",
    "[ figlinear](a ) shows the band structures of a 3-qls slab .",
    "its corresponding dos ( presented in fig .",
    "[ figlinear](b ) ) shows very nice linear energy dependence within the bulk energy gap as expected .",
    "this type of dos can be easily measured by low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) , which will provide an indirect method to probe the existence of linear surface states .",
    "the above discussions presented in sections ii and iii concentrate on the effective hamiltonian and the detailed understanding to the properties of surface states . by such a way , we can analyze the topological nature of specific compound . on the other hand , however , the topological nature can be also understood from simple bulk studies , where a gap close - reopening transition ( a topological phase transition ) can be obtained by tuning some parameters  @xcite .",
    "we will show in this section that such a phase transition can be indeed obtained in sb@xmath0(te@xmath2se@xmath3)@xmath1 alloy system .",
    "( te@xmath2se@xmath3)@xmath1 as a function of se concentration @xmath40 .",
    "ti denotes the topological insulator , while si means the simple insulator . ]",
    "the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) method proposed by bellaiche  @xcite is used here to simulate the doping process .",
    "the solid solution elements are treated as different atomic species with their own weights , rather than being treated as a whole virtual atom . with this method",
    ", we investigate the se doping dependence of band structure of sb@xmath0(te@xmath2se@xmath3)@xmath1 .",
    "we assume that crystal parameters and positions of inner atoms change linearly with doping , and they are obtained by linear interpolation in calculation .",
    "the evolution of the gap energy of sb@xmath0(te@xmath2se@xmath3)@xmath1 as a function of se concentration is calculated and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fige3 ] . with increasing se doping , the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum get closer gradually (",
    "0 @xmath92 0.94 ) , attributed to the gradually decreased soc strength .",
    "consequently , the two bands cross at the critical point @xmath40 = 0.94 , resulting in a 3d topological quantum phase transition .",
    "an band - inverse appears when the doping concentration further increases .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the occurrence of 3d topological phase transition is driven by the soc interaction .",
    "in reality , the most stable crystal structure of sb@xmath0se@xmath1 is slightly distorted from the rhombohedral structure of sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , however , as long as the sb@xmath0se@xmath1 is topologically trivial , such 3d topological phase transition will be expected . at the phase transition point",
