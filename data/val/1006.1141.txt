    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) deals with the statistical properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random matrices drawn from a certain probability measure .",
    "the theory was successfully applied by wigner @xcite in the 1950s to describe the spectral properties of complex many - body nuclei where the underlying hamiltonians are so complicated that a useful way to study the system turned out to be through a statistical treatment of the hamiltonians @xcite . since then",
    ", rmt has been applied to a wide variety of systems in diverse areas , including e.g. many - body atoms and nuclei , quantum chaos , mesoscopic disordered conductors , 2-d quantum gravity , conformal field theory , chiral phase transitions as well as zeros of riemann zeta function , scale - free networks , biological networks , communication systems and financial markets @xcite .",
    "this broad range of applicability of rmt in seemingly unrelated areas highlights the universal features of the correlations of the eigenvalues in rmt . within the classical gaussian model pioneered by wigner ,",
    "these correlations are known as the wigner - dyson ( wd ) statistics of the gaussian ensembles , which are qualitatively different from the statistical features of completely uncorrelated eigenvalues given by the poisson statistics .    in the past decades",
    ", many attempts have been made to construct _",
    "generalized _ random matrix ensembles that incorporate _ power - law _ or _ fat - tail _ distributions .",
    "the significance of such generalization beyond the gaussian ensembles is mainly two fold .",
    "first of all , it is conceivable that the wide applicability of classical or gaussian rm models is closely linked to the prevalence of normal or gaussian distributions in nature , a consequence of the central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "it has , however , not been fully investigated if there is a counterpart of the gaussian ensemble as implied by the structure of the _ generalized _ central limit theorem @xcite , comparing e.g , the gaussian and the lvy basins .",
    "second , there have been expanding interests in rmt applications to generic complex systems such as financial markets , scale - free network , earthquakes etc .",
    "@xcite that feature fat - tail noise , but the relevance of the classical rm models in these systems seems questionable .",
    "this is because the gaussian ensemble is based on the assumption that the systems are characterized by gaussian noise , which is clearly not suitable for systems with fat - tail noise where the occurrence of extreme events are not as rare as expected from normal distributions .",
    "so far , fat - tail distributions in random matrix ensembles have been carefully incorporated in some limited cases and the calculation of the correlation functions of eigenvalues have been carried out for certain special cases @xcite .",
    "however , the question regarding the universality of the correlations of the eigenvalues remains unresolved . for gaussian ensembles",
    "it is the well known two - level sine kernel that establishes the universality of the correlations in the properly scaled large @xmath9 ( matrix size ) limit ; it is not clear if there exists a similar universal two - level kernel for the power - law or the fat - tail ensembles as well .",
    "in fact , the suggestion of a novel universality beyond the gaussian ensembles comes from the study of the anderson transition in the disordered electronic systems @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the gaussian ensemble is only relevant in the metallic regime where all the eigenstates are extended across the entire system and correlations of the corresponding eigenvalues are well described by the wd statistics .",
    "as the disorder is made strong enough , the eigenstates become localized and thus the eigenvalues become uncorrelated . especially at the delocalization - localization transition",
    ", it has been established that the correlations of the eigenvectors exhibit novel features @xcite such as multi - fractality and the correlations of the eigenvalues lead to a level compressibility that is intermediate between wd and poisson statistics .",
    "similarly in the studies of quantum chaos , energy level statistics of systems that are intermediate between chaotic and regular states also require generalization beyond wd and poisson statistics @xcite . in these contexts ,",
    "extensive studies have been carried out to construct a parametric generalization of rm models that cross over from wd to poisson @xcite as a function of the parameter .",
    "some of these generalizations indeed capture the essential features of the critical statistics , among which the family of q - rmes @xcite provides a particularly valuable insight . within the common framework of rotationally invariant rm models @xcite",
    "the q - rmes show how the universality of the gaussian ensemble characterized by the well - known _ sine _ kernel breaks down and eventually gives rise to a different kind of universality for the critical ensembles , characterized by a one - parameter two - level _ sinh _ kernel .",
    "in particular , the rotationally invariant rm models are characterized by a `` confining potential '' which defines the weight function of a set of orthogonal polynomials ; the key difference between the gaussian and the critical ensembles comes from the fact that the corresponding orthogonal polynomials , namely classical vs. @xmath10-orthogonal polynomials , respectively , possess qualitatively different asymptotic properties @xcite .    in the motivation to investigate the universality associated with fat - tail or power - law rmes , we introduced a family of @xmath0 invariant random matrix ensembles characterized by an asymptotic logarithmic potential @xmath11^{1+\\lambda}$ ] with @xmath12 @xcite , which we will refer to as  @xmath1-ensembles \" .",
    "reflects the motivation of the study . ]",
    "the reason for such a choice of the potential is based on the following few observations .",
    "first , it is known that for @xmath13 ^ 2 $ ] corresponding to @xmath14 ( the critical ensemble ) , the eigenvalue spectrum is given by inverse power - law distribution , as known by the mean - field theoretic approach @xcite .",
    "second , for @xmath15 corresponding to the @xmath7 limit with the constant @xmath16 being order of @xmath9 ( free lvy matrices ) , the spectral density is given by the fat - tail distributions .",
    "third , in the limit @xmath17 , it is expected that the confinement potential may grow sufficiently strong , thereby approaching the gaussian limit .",
    "the fact that such a parametric generalization connects various existing rm models is interesting since the model allows us to explore any possible novel universality associated with fat - tail rmes and with logarithmic soft - confinement potentials within the rotationally invariant rmt framework .",
    "it is well known from the mean - field theoretic approach @xcite that rmes with logarithmic soft - confinement are characteristically different from those with strong confinement potentials given by @xmath18 .",
    "the reason is that for the soft - confinment potential , the eigenvalue density does not depend on @xmath9 and has a non - trivial functional form , which is not translationally invariant .",
    "it means that the required unfolding is non - trivial .",
    "in fact , the non - trivial unfolding procedure give rise to the deviation from the wd statistics . in the following",
    ", we will show by studying the two - level kernel that the @xmath1-ensembles exhibits interesting deviations from wd statistics .",
    "especially , the presence of the anomalous component in the two - level kernel is a common characteristics of all the logarithmic confinement potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii we provide a brief review of the orthogonal polynomial method and in sec iii we discuss the model ensemble . in sec iv we will show the results and finally in sec v we will discuss the results with concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the set of @xmath0 invariant hermitian matrices @xmath19 with the following probability measure @xmath20 } dh,\\ ] ] where the confining potential @xmath21 is a suitably increasing function of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the matrix trace and @xmath24 the haar measure . in the eigenvector basis , the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath25 of the matrices can be written in the form @xcite @xmath26 here the factor @xmath27 is the vandermonde determinant .",
    "given a set of ( monic ) polynomials @xmath28 that are orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 the n - level correlation of eigenvalues @xmath31 can be written in a compact form in terms of the the two - level kernel in the following manner , @xmath32 _ { \\{i , j=0, ... ,n\\ } } .\\ ] ] here the two - level kernel @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 where the `` wave function '' @xmath35 . by using the christoffel - darboux formula , the kernel is simplified to ( for the monic polynomials ) @xmath36 in general , the large @xmath9 asymptotic behavior of the orthogonal polynomials with respect to any weight function characterized by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , have behavior qualitatively similar to the hermite polynomials @xcite , such that the asymptotic behavior of the wave function in the @xmath39 limit is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are scaling variables , namely , d@xmath43 and @xmath44 such that the mean density @xmath45 is unity in the n @xmath46 limit . in this limit ,",
    "the two - level kernel in the scaled variables become @xmath47 which is the celebrated sine kernel . thus , in the framework of orthogonal polynomial method , the universality of random matrix ensembles is traced to the similarity of the scaling behavior in the large @xmath9 limit of the polynomials corresponding to the probability measure under consideration @xcite . in particular , the orthogonal polynomials corresponding to all ` freud - type ' weight functions @xmath48 , with monotonically increasing polynomial @xmath21 , share similar asymptotic behavior in the large @xmath9 limit .",

    "the significance of @xmath60 is that it determines the upper bound of the spectral density and thus the scaling behavior of the bulk of the spectrum in the large @xmath9 limit @xcite .",
    "for example , for the gaussian ensembles characterized by @xmath65 ( hermite polynomials ) , the upper bound of the spectral density is @xmath66 in the large @xmath9 limit .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that deficiency of sum rule rule @xmath193 increases as @xmath1 decreases as shown in section b , since the slope of number variance is directly related to the deficiency of the sum rule : @xmath194    -ensembles for @xmath1950.5 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 ( @xmath83 = 0.50 ) . ]",
    "in this work , we further study an invariant - class of random matrix ensembles characterized by the asymptotic logarithmic soft - confinement potentials introduced in ref .  [ ] which we refer to as the @xmath1-ensembles . as a first step , we carefully reinvestigate the spectral density of the @xmath1-ensembles and show that instead of a @xmath1-dependent power law in a restricted regime , the spectral density is given more accurately by a power - law of the form @xmath4^{\\lambda-1}/x$ ] .",
    "this result is suggested by the mean - filed approach and it can be checked by the normalization condition of the spectral density , the edge of which is determined by the coefficient @xmath60 of the @xmath1-generalization of the @xmath10-polynomials .",
    "second , we show that the two - level kernel of the @xmath1-ensembles has normal / anomalous structure , which is characteristic of the critical ensembles . the anomalous component arising due to the sum rule violation is dependent on the parameter @xmath1 for a given value of @xmath83 which is kept @xmath196 in the numerics ; as the value of the @xmath1 decreases , the deficiency of the sum rule becomes larger .",
    "third , we identify the normal and anomalous components of the two - level kernel in the semi - classical regime , which are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - kn ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq - k - anom ] ) that reduce to those of the critical ensembles for @xmath5 .",
    "further , we show that the two - level kernel of the @xmath1-ensembles exhibits a distinct universal asymptotic behavior , shown by eqs .",
    "( [ k - asymptotic ] ) , which includes the gaussian ensembles ( @xmath6 limit ) , the critical ensembles ( @xmath14 ) as well as the uncorrelated poisson - like behavior ( @xmath7 limit ) . in particular , the large @xmath184 behavior of the two - level kernel is governed by @xmath197 $ ] , which is the characteristic feature of the @xmath1-ensembles .",
    "it is expected that the asymptotic tail of the spacing distribution is also given by a similar exponential form .",
    "lastly , we show that the number variance is linear in @xmath126 for large @xmath126 .",
    "the slope of number variance or the level compressibility is dependent on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , the slope increases , which is consistent with the fact that anomaly or the deficiency of the sum rule increases as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "all the features of the @xmath1-ensembles shown above such as the ghost peak , the deficiency of the sum - rule , the finite compressibility as well as the asymptotic exponential decay of the kernel seem to suggest that the @xmath1-ensembles belong to the critical ensembles characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the @xmath1-ensembles would be relevant to the description of the critical states of the localization - delocalization problems in disordered systems .",
    "since the critical level statistics are universal , depending only on the critical exponent and the dimensionality of system for a given symmetry class , it is conceivable that the parameter @xmath198 can be associated with these parameters . in particular , the study of the dimensional dependence of the critical statistics is interesting since the parameters of the critical level statistics such as the critical exponent and the multi - fractal dimension are dependent on the spatial dimension of the system .    at the same time , it is also interesting to see if @xmath1-ensembles are also applicable in the study of quantum chaos",
    ". recently the critical statistics has been found relevant in some cases of quantum chaos as well @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the two level kernel of chaotic systems with logarithmic singularity @xcite have the exact same form as that of the critical ensembles .",
    "another important implication of the @xmath1-ensembles is in regard to the question that we posed earlier , namely if there is a universality of the correlations of the eigenvalues associated with fat - tail distributions .",
    "our results seem to suggest that a non - trivial @xmath9-dependence of two - level kernel of the fat - tail rmes is a generic feature within the framework of rotationally - invariant rmt . in the @xmath7 limit of the @xmath1-ensembles",
    ", @xmath83 is required to be an @xmath9-dependent parameter to have the probability measure to be normalizable , which is the case for the free lvy matrices .",
    "thus , the @xmath9-dependence of the two - level kernel in this limit can be understood as a consequence of the presence of the @xmath9-dependent parameter in the model ensemble , which can not be simply scaled out .    in conclusion , we show that the family of rmes with the asymptotic logarithmic soft - confinement potentials characterized by @xmath1 , called the ",
    "@xmath1-ensembles \" , connects the wd universality ( @xmath6 ) , the uncorrelated poisson - like behavior ( @xmath7 ) and exhibit a critical behavior for all the intermediate @xmath1 value ( @xmath199 ) in the semi - classical regime .",
    "we expect that further study of the @xmath1-ensembles and the @xmath1-generalization of @xmath10-polynomials will lead to a deeper understanding of the universality of random matrix ensembles in general",
