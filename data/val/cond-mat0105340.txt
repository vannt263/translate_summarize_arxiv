    "even a quick look at the set of known proteins ( pdb database ) reveals a striking feature . while there are tens of thousands of protein sequences , they only assume some thousands folds . in other words , proteins are highly designable .",
    "this concept can be quantified by measuring the number of sequences that fold uniquely into a particular structure .    with the use of a simple 20 letter lattice model @xcite of protein folding it",
    "has been shown @xcite that the whole issue of estimating the number @xmath0 of sequences that fold to the same conformation is reduced to enumerate how many of them have native energy lying below a threshold @xmath1 , the energy which any sequence with the same composition displays in the conformation structurally dissimilar to the native conformation @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a reliable , analytic expression for @xmath0 , which we shall show increases exponentially with the gap @xmath2 between the native energy of the optimal sequence @xmath3 and the threshold energy @xmath1 .",
    "this functional form is found to be universal , as it emerges from the central limit theorem .",
    "we have furthermore found that while the parameters defining @xmath0 depend on the interaction matrix , they are independent of the particular choice made for the native structure or for the optimal sequence .    in sections 2 and 3 we briefly review the 20 letters lattice model of proteins in general and the question of protein designability in particular .",
    "the quantitative , analytic answer to the question of how many mutations a designed protein tolerates is given in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are collected in section 5 .",
    "a useful theoretical approach to study protein folding is provided by a simplified lattice model , where the protein is a string of beads that is arranged on a cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "the configurational energy of a chain of n monomers is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the effective interaction potential between monomers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote their lattice positions and @xmath10 is the contact function . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) the pairwise interaction is different from zero when @xmath11 and @xmath12 occupy nearest  neighbour sites , i.e. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 indicates the step length of the lattice .",
    "in addition to these interactions , it is assumed that on  site repulsive forces prevent two amino acids to occupy the same site simultaneously , so that @xmath17 .",
    "we shall consider throughout a 20letters representation of protein sequence where @xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix .",
    "a possible realization of this matrix is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( table 5 and 6 ) , where it was derived from frequencies of contacts between different amino acids in protein structures .",
    "the employment of a @xmath19 matrix ensures that the threshold energy @xmath1 is well defined , depending only on the interaction matrix elements and on the composition of the protein in terms of amino acids .",
    "the model we study here is a generic heteropolymer model which has been shown to reproduce important generic features of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics , independent on the particular potential chosen @xcite .",
    "however , in using such an approach , one should keep in mind that the labelling of amino acids ( spherical beads all of the same size and with no side chain ) is generic too and may be no obvious relation between those labels and labels for real amino acids .",
    "good  folder sequences are characterized by a large gap @xmath20 ( compared to the standard deviation @xmath21 of the contact energies ) between the energy of the designed sequence in the native conformation @xmath3 , and the lowest energy of the conformations structurally dissimilar to the native conformation @xcite . in other words ,",
    "good folders are associated with a normalized gap @xmath22 , quantity closely related to the z  score @xcite .",
    "for example , the 36mer sequence listed in the caption to fig . 1 and called s@xmath23 in the literature @xcite , designed by minimizing the energy in the target ( native ) conformation with respect to amino acid sequence for fixed composition has , in the units considered here ( @xmath24 @xcite ) , an energy gap @xmath25 and thus a sufficiently large value of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) so as to ensure fast folding .",
    "in fact , monte carlo simulations carried out at the temperature @xmath28 of 3000 36mers with energies , in the native conformation , lying inside the gap fold in times @xmath29 mc steps @xcite ( for caveats see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    "s@xmath23 folds in @xmath30 mc steps .",
    "it has been also shown that most of the thermodynamical @xcite and dynamical @xcite behaviour of designed proteins is controlled by only @xmath31 of the sites . as a consequence , making mutations in these sites , which are called `` hot '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , one destroys , as a rule , the ability the protein has to fold ( denaturation ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of substitutions in any other site ( that can be regarded as `` cold '' ) are small , leading to neutral mutations .",
    "while twenty letters heteropolymers capture the essential components of real proteins , it is hardly possible to enumerate all sequences which have a given conformation as their non  degenerate ground state .",
    "accordingly , it is not possible to calculate the exact designability of protein conformations . to bypass this problem",
    ", we shall determine designability from energetic considerations , using a strategy which relies on the fact that all sequences which have an energy lower than @xmath1 fold on short call , in any case in times which are much shorter than that associated with the random search @xcite .",
    "any sequence of a given length @xmath32 ( e.g. @xmath33 ) can be obtained making @xmath34 mutations ( i.e. substitution of a amino acid in a given site with a different one ) in the minimum energy sequence ( e.g. s@xmath23 in the case of fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . consequently",
    ", the designability of a conformation can be found starting from the minimum energy sequence , counting how many mutations lay within the gap @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath35 is the change in the energy of the native state produced by a mutation , @xmath36 the energy distribution probability associated with @xmath37 mutations and @xmath38 the total number of sequences that can be produced by introducing @xmath37 mutations in the minimum energy sequence , designability can be defined as @xmath39 so far , we have done nothing more than expressing the problem in another way , since to know the spectrum of mutation energies of the optimal sequence one has again to enumerate all sequences .",
    "in fact , it looks like as if we have made things even worse , in that now one has to find the optimal sequence , which is a non  trivial problem , and also has to ensure that @xmath1 does not change with mutations .",
    "we shall show in the following that the distribution of mutation energies does not depend on the particular structure or on the particular sequence chosen ( provided that @xmath40 ) nor on the contact energy matrix used to design the protein , but only on its composition and on the number of contacts ( or the length , if it is fully compact ) .",
    "this observation leaves room to approximations .",
    "in fact , if one is able to find an approximate expression for @xmath41 , such an expression will hold for all model proteins of the same length .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of the sequence associated with the global minimum of energy @xmath42 is not necessary ( because all sequences have the same spectrum of mutations ) , only the value of @xmath3 is required .",
    "consequently , even if the optimal sequence can not be known without a full enumeration of all sequences , it is allowed to use any other sequence with energy @xmath43 , introducing in this way only an error in the integration boundaries ( and not on the function to be integrated ) .",
    "it is then possible to calculate designability of a structure from eq .",
    "( 23 ) using an approximate distribution @xmath41 and an approximate value of @xmath2 .",
    "the most conservative way to calculate the number of sequences which fold to a conformation is then to use a distribution @xmath36 found only by swappings between the residues of the optimal sequence , as in such a way the composition is conserved and @xmath1 does not change . on the other hand ,",
    "since there are also sequences with different composition folding to the same conformation , one is also forced , in principle , to calculate the number @xmath0 associated with pointlike mutations .",
    "the values found from swapping of amino acids and from pointlike mutations can be viewed as the lower and the upper limit to designability , respectively .    in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) we display the unnormalized energy distribution probabilities associated with two composition  conserving and with two pointlike mutations of s@xmath23 ( the integral of these distributions being the total number of sequences ) .",
    "each of these curves can be well fitted by the sum of two gaussians , whose means are @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "2(a ) , composition conserving case ) and @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) , pointlike mutations case ) .",
    "standard deviations are @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and @xmath48 and @xmath50 ( fig . 2(b ) ) .",
    "the behaviour of these two distributions seems very alike , except for the fact that the area below the composition  conserving curve is much smaller than that below the pointlike mutations curve .",
    "this is because much fewer mutations can be made in the first than in the second case and , consequently , the associated gaussian behaviour is less well defined .    the overall structure of the curves shown in fig .",
    "2 can be understood from the fact that the average value of @xmath35 for `` cold '' sites is @xmath51 and for `` hot '' sites is @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the low  energy peak can be associated with two mutations in `` cold '' sites , while the high  energy peak can be associated with a mutation in a `` cold '' site and a mutation in a `` hot '' site .",
    "the contribution from mutations in two `` hot '' sites leads to an enhancement of the high energy tail of the curve . concerning the gaussian behaviour",
    ", we note that the energies associated with the 19 possible mutations on a given `` cold '' site are uncorrelated .",
    "in other words , one has to pay an energy @xmath53 ( concerning the factor @xmath54 one is reminded of the fact that @xmath55 gets contributions from two mutations ) to remove the wild  type residue , reflecting the fact that it has been optimized .",
    "second , one has to introduce a new residue in the _ niche _ left by the wild  type residue .",
    "the gaussian shape of the distribution suggests that the _ niche _ is neutral with respect to the new residue and that the new interactions are merely random . to be more precise , the change in energy @xmath35 upon mutations is the difference between the energy needed to remove the original residue ( which is roughly constant and assumes two different values for cold and for hot sites ) and the sum of a number of contact energies associated with the new residue , energies which can be considered as random numbers .",
    "being the sum of random numbers , the energy associated with the new residue is forced to respect the central limit theorem , and consequently its distribution approaches a gaussian function .",
    "of course , an exact gaussian distribution could be reached only if the number of nearest neighbours of each site were infinite ( while in a cubic lattice this is , at most , five ) . on the other hand , the fact that @xmath36 can be accurately fitted by gaussian distributions ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , fig .",
    "2(b ) ) testifies to the fact that we are not far from the conditions in which the central limit theorem holds .    while the hypothesis that `` cold '' mutations give raise to gaussian  like peaks is quite grounded , due to the uncorrelateness of the energy contributions of `` cold '' sites , it is unlikely that the central limit theorem works properly for `` hot '' sites , whose energy contributions are correlated @xcite . in order to calculate the degree of designability of a protein conformation",
    ", we only need to know the contributions from cold sites and , consequently , we don not need to better characterize the peaks associated to `` hot '' sites .    we have found that the distribution of mutation energies are rather universal functions .",
    "examples of such a behaviour are shown in fig .",
    "3 , where 2pointlikes mutations spectra @xmath56 associated with low energy 36mer sequences optimized ( making use of the mj elements of table 6 ) on three different conformation ( cf . figs .",
    "1(a)1(c ) ) and with three sequences designed on the same conformation ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) are displayed .",
    "similar results have been obtained for chains of different lengths .",
    "furthermore , using different @xmath19 interaction matrices lead to the same gaussian behaviour of @xmath56 , although the mean values and the standard deviations are different .",
    "this is again a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "4 , where we display the function @xmath56 associated with two pointlike mutations on s@xmath23 ( cf .",
    "1 ) , but making use this time of the interaction matrix elements listed in table 5 of ref . @xcite . because the average change in energy upon mutations in cold sites is zero ,",
    "while that in hot sites is @xmath57 , it is easy to identify the peaks associated with two cold mutations ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , with one cold and one hot mutations ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , and with two hot mutations ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .    summing up , the function @xmath56 associated with chains of different length and sequence as well as designed on different native conformations overlap quite nicely , suggesting that the spectrum of both composition conserving and non  conserving mutations is universal . on the other hand , the actual value of @xmath55 and @xmath64 characterizing the different peaks of the energy distribution probability depend on the matrix used to describe the contact energies among the amino acids .",
    "the univerality of the energy distribution probability is in agreement with the interpretation of the main peaks of the spectrum of mutations of a designed protein in term of `` cold '' and `` hot '' sites .",
    "in fact , the properties of the `` hot '' sites are rather homogeneous , their contribution to the mutation spectrum being universal . assuming furthermore that the interactions associated to the mutations in `` cold '' sites are random",
    ", the resulting energy distribution is gaussian ( and so universal ) , and its standard deviation depends only on the interaction matrix , while its average value depends on the degree of optimization of the wild  type monomer .",
    "this , in turn , can be approximated by the degree of optimization of the whole chain ( measured by the energy gap @xmath2 ) divided by its length , a quantity which is essentially constant for long chains @xcite ( for example , in the case of s@xmath23 this number is @xmath65 ) .",
    "the basic idea to calculate the designability of a model protein , as we have discussed above , is to find a simple approximation to the universal distribution of energies associated with mutations onto the optimal sequence , integrate this distribution up to the gap @xmath2 and normalize this result to the total number of mutations that one can make ( cf .",
    "( 23 ) ) . as a consequence of this",
    ", designability turns out to depend only on the length of the protein ( through the total number of mutations ) and on the gap @xmath2 . in order to calculate @xmath0 using eq .",
    "( 23 ) we have first to know the total number @xmath38 of sequences that can be obtained by making @xmath37 sequence  conserving mutations ( swappings ) in the optimal sequence .",
    "this number can be obtained by counting the number of ways one can select @xmath37 sites , multiplied by the number of permutations of these sites which move all the @xmath37 residues .",
    "that is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of ways one can permute m sites in such a way that only @xmath11 positions are kept fixed . from the relation",
    "@xmath68 it is possible to extract the expression for @xmath69 , @xmath70 for large @xmath37 , one can use the stirling approximation for the factorials in eqs .",
    "( 46 ) , and keep only the largest exponent term in the sum ( saddle point approximation ) , obtaining @xmath71 .",
    "the constant @xmath72 can be determined from the relation @xmath73 , which for @xmath33 leads to @xmath74 .    to proceed further in the calculation of @xmath0",
    ", one needs to find a simple approximation to @xmath36 . for this purpose",
    ", we shall express the energy distribution of an arbitrary number of mutations as a convolution of functions @xmath56 associated with the swapping of two amino acids .",
    "the validity of this approximation rests on the ansatz that every couple of mutations affect the energy of the native state independently of the other couple of mutations .",
    "this approximation is expected to work also for large values of @xmath37 , where the probability of mutating neighbouring sites is not negligible , because the contact energy associated with the mutated residues are in any case random quantities with average zero ( cf .",
    "the discussion in the previous section ) . within this scenario ,",
    "the number of folding sequences displaying @xmath75 mutations and whose energy in the native conformation lies inside the energy gap can be written as @xmath76 making use of the energy distribution probability associated with an amino acid swapping ( composition conserving mutations ) or with two point  like mutations ( composition non  conserving mutations ) one obtains the lower and the upper limit of the designability of a conformation .    in what follows",
    "we shall essentially discuss the case of composition conserving mutations . if @xmath2 is lower than the peak associated with mutations in `` hot '' sites ( as in the case of the sequence s@xmath23 where @xmath25 , cf .",
    "2 ) , one should convolute only the peak of @xmath56 associated with mutations in `` cold '' sites @xcite . exploiting the fact that the convolution of @xmath37 gaussian distributions , of the form @xmath77 is a gaussian distribution with average @xmath78 and standard deviation @xmath79 ,",
    "it is possible to write @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( in the case of s@xmath23 this condition means @xmath82 ) one can neglect the first exponential factor in the integral , in which case the integration can be carried out analytically , leading to @xmath83 - 1\\right ) \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where the substitution @xmath84 has been made .",
    "this equation tells us that designability increases exponentially with the gap @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the number of sequences folding to a ( compact ) conformation is determined only by the gap associated with the minimum energy sequence .",
    "we have shown that the concepts of designability ( i.e. number of sequences folding to a given conformation ) and foldability ( i.e. , thermodinamical stability of the sequences with low energy on the given conformation , expressed by the gap @xmath2 ) are intimately connected by eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . if a protein is stable in its native conformation , such native conformation is necessarilly highly designable .",
    "vice versa , if a conformation is highly designable , there exist sequences with a large gap folding to it .    to give a numerical evaluation of protein conformations , we make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ) in the form @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 does not depend on @xmath37 and , for the case of the structure displayed in fig .",
    "1(a ) , assumes the value @xmath87 ( in keeping with the fact that @xmath25 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) . in the case in which @xmath90 , which in the case of the 36mer under discussion implies @xmath91 , one can keep only the largest term in the above sum . within this approximation one can write @xmath92 , a number to be compared with @xmath93 .",
    "one can mention , for the sake of completeness , that the number of sequences within the gap obtained by pointlike mutations ( which is the upper limit to designability ) , is well fitted by the function @xmath94 , while the total number of sequences is @xmath95 .",
    "the degree of designability of a given conformation depends exponentially on the energy gap @xmath2 .",
    "since the number of folding sequences is given by the integral of a universal function ( the mutation energy distribution ) carried up to @xmath2 , a quantity which also determines the thermal stability of the designed protein , one can conclude that designability and thermal stability are strongly interconnected .",
    "in other words , sequences displaying large gaps are both thermally stable and highly designable . even sequences displaying , in the native conformation , a small gap fold on short call and share ( in the compaction process ) the conserved contacts leading to local elementary structures and to the ( post  critical ) folding nucleus @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is possible to obtain from them , through composition  conserving mutations , other sequences folding to the same native conformation and displaying a large gap . in other words ,",
    "any sequence able to fold fast , folds to a highly designable conformation .",
    "we have estimated that there are of the order of @xmath96 sequences folding to a compact 36mer conformation , over a total of @xmath97 .",
    "this is only the lower limit , but let us assume that it describes well the typical degree of designability of the designed protein .",
    "is this number small or big ?",
    "the answer to this question has , of course , important implications from the evolutionary point of view . if good folders were distributed homogeneously in the space of sequences ( like in the case of rna @xcite ) the important parameter would be their density , that is @xmath98 .",
    "this number would be very low , preventing sequences from moving along neutral pathways ( which are collections of sequences folding to the same conformation and differing by single mutations ) .",
    "such a scenario is very unfavourable for evolution .",
    "the situation is however quite different for proteins .",
    "in fact , it has been shown @xcite that good folders group themselves in clusters and superclusters , giving rise to a quite an inhomogeneous landscape .",
    "consequently , the relevant parameter which measures the designability of a conformation is the total number of sequences which conserve , in any way , the energy gap .",
    "this number ( @xmath99 ) is very large in particular in keeping with the fact that over a life span of the order of 60 mutations occur in the genome of each person @xcite ) .",
