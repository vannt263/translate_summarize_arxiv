    "the search for the new superconducting cuprates by bednorz and mller @xcite was inspired by the idea that in systems containing jahn - teller ( jt ) ions the strong interaction of electrons with local distortions may lead to high transition temperatures . while meanwhile the contribution of a jt mechanism to superconductivity is controversial , the coupling of electrons to the lattice in cuprates is evidenced in numerous experiments .",
    "these include among others the observation of an isotope effect in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) data @xcite and in t@xmath1 away from optimal doping ,  @xcite the softening of certain phonons under doping ,  @xcite and the existence of a critical cuo@xmath3 octahedra tilt angle for the existence of superconductivity in lanthanum cuprates .",
    "@xcite also the kink in the electronic dispersion as seen in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments has been attributed to strong electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interactions @xcite which in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath4 compounds is supported by the observation of an isotope effect in the corresponding energy scale @xcite ( cf . also ref . and references therein ) .",
    "however , density functional theory ( dft ) usually yields an electron - phonon coupling constant which is too small in order to explain the high transition temperatures of the cuprate materials .  @xcite this becomes even worse when the effect of electronic correlations is considered which are underestimated within the dft method .",
    "basically , correlations suppress the charge fluctuations and thus the scattering of electrons from phonons , which leads to a further reduction of the el - ph interaction ( for a review cf . refs . ) .    in terms of hubbard type models the el - ph interaction is usually investigated for couplings which arise from an expansion of on - site energies in terms of some vibrational coordinates @xcite",
    "so that in general both interactions , electronic and electron - phonon , are local or at least have a dominant local contribution .    the interplay of el - el and el - ph interactions leads to a screening of the latter over the whole brillouin zone which is most pronounced at large momenta .",
    "@xcite for sizeable correlations the maximum in the phonon self - energy is then shifted from the peierls wave - vector to @xmath5 , which for strong electron lattice couplings eventually induces a phase separation instability .    within a slave - boson technique",
    "the influence of correlations onto the el - ph interaction has also been investigated within a three - band model where the phonons have been coupled locally to the copper and oxygen density .  @xcite it was found that generically the renormalization of the el - ph vertex depends on @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the fermi velocity ) .",
    "it turns out to be strongly suppressed if this ratio is @xmath8 , i.e. in the static limit , while it is almost unaffected in the dynamical limit .    while the interplay between correlations and local ( holstein - type ) el - ph interaction is quite well understood , the situation for transitive couplings is less clear . in a lattice model",
    "this type of coupling arises from the modulation of hopping integrals due to lattice vibrations .",
    "vertex renormalization effects have been studied in the context of a tj - model in ref . and for the @xmath9 hubbard model within a slave - boson scheme in refs . .",
    "we are not aware of any similar investigation for transitive couplings within an approach , which can cover the parameter space from weak coupling up to the mott regime , which is the task we want to accomplish in the present paper .    in cuprates ,",
    "transitive electron - phonon couplings are believed to be of significance for the so - called breathing and buckling modes which correspond to in- and out - of plane motions of the oxygen atoms and which contribute most to the pairing interaction arising from phonons .",
    "@xcite for example , the inclusion of a screened coulomb interaction within the lda - u method @xcite greatly enhances the el - ph interaction of the half - breathing mode whereas the influence on the full - breathing mode is much weaker .",
    "an extensive analysis of the strength and material dependencies of theses phonon modes , including also apical oxygen modes , has recently been performed in ref . .",
    "it was found that the planar oxygen b@xmath2 c - axis modes lead to the strongest enhancement of d - wave superconductivity .",
    "moreover , upon including long - range coulomb interactions , which in a layered system lead to low energy plasmon excitations @xmath10 , the coupling can even be overscreened , i.e. the b@xmath2 vertex increases with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "again the effect of strong local correlations on the coupling of charge carriers to b@xmath2 modes has not been considered in ref . and is the purpose of the present paper .    within a one - dimensional model",
    "we have previously studied the influence of a transitive el - ph interaction on the phonon self - energy @xmath11 .  @xcite most interestingly it was found that @xmath11 can be enhanced for small momenta upon switching on the hubbard interaction whereas for large momentum @xmath11 becomes suppressed with @xmath12 similar to the case of a local ( holstein ) el - ph interaction .",
    "plane with cu ( small , red ) and oxygen ( large , blue ) ions .",
    "electronic degrees of freedom are on the cu sites and vibrational degrees on the oxygen sites .",
    "notice that the configuration where oxygens on the x - bonds are distorted in the negative z - direction leads to the same model hamiltonian as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham]).,width=264 ]    motivated by this finding we investigate in the present paper the interplay between electronic correlations and a transitive el - ph interaction with regard to the cooper scattering amplitude .",
    "we exemplify this interplay for the buckling mode where electrons couple to out - of - plane ( z - direction ) motions of the oxygen atoms . for a planar cuo@xmath0 system , due to symmetry",
    ", this kind of coupling would be quadratic in the z - coordinates .",
    "@xcite however , for vibrations around static @xmath13-displacements of the oxygen atoms one recovers a linear el - ph interaction .",
    "the static configuration of a frozen - in @xmath14 mode where all oxygen atoms are displaced along the same direction ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) corresponds to the buckling of the plane in yba@xmath0cu@xmath15o@xmath16 ( ybco ) and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath17 ( bi2212 ) whereas the static @xmath18 deformation has its realization in the tilting of the cuo@xmath3 octahedra in the low - temperature orthorhombic phase of la@xmath19sr@xmath20cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the direction of positive oxygen displacements @xmath21 on top of the static deformation .",
    "the model which we introduce in the nect section is valid for both cases , @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , for the latter distortion one has to take into account a staggered positive direction of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore our investigations hold for a broad class of cuprate materials .",
    "for the sake of clarity it should be stated that the interplay between correlations and el - ph interactions strongly depends on the model under consideration .",
    "for example , a coupling to local density fluctuations in the three - band model for cuprate superconductors may transform into a transitive coupling when one derives an effective low - energy one - band model by eliminating the high energy degrees of freedom ( cf .",
    "e.g. ref . ) . in our paper",
    "we are concerned with a one - band hamiltonian with transitive electron - phonon interactions which can be contrasted with analogous calculations for a local holstein - type coupling in ref .  .",
    "nevertheless one should keep in mind that our results may also mimic the local el - ph coupling in related multiband models .",

    "@xcite the idea is to evaluate the energy of eq .",

    "the corresponding formal procedure is analogous to that described in ref . .",
    "notice that on the ga level the coupling to the lattice fluctuations is reduced @xmath56 by the correlations . however , the tdga induces additional couplings to local ( @xmath57 ) and transitive ( @xmath58 ) density fluctuations and we will show below that in certain cases this will even lead to an enhancement of the electron - phonon vertex .",
    "finally we obtain for the lattice energy @xmath59 and it turns out that the elimination of the double occupancy introduces a novel renormalization and a mixing of the @xmath60-buckling modes : @xmath61    the eigenmodes are obtained from the transformation @xmath62 with @xmath63 and correspond to out- ( i.e. @xmath64 symmetry ) and in- ( i.e. a@xmath2 symmetry ) phase oscillations of the @xmath65 oxygen atoms .",

    "the largest coupling is obtained for b@xmath2 symmetry where the isotropic s - wave pair scattering is more attractive than that for d - wave pairs since we are analyzing only the renormalized el - ph interaction without the direct effect of the coulomb repulsion on the scattering amplitude . in both channels , b@xmath2 and a@xmath2 , and for all symmetries the average scattering from the modes continuously decreases with increasing @xmath113 due to the reduction of the respective vertices . in the parameter range @xmath162 it turns out that @xmath163 is not much affected by doping . on the other hand",
    "one finds that for @xmath113 beyond the brinkmann - rice limit and doping close to half - filling ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v1]a ) the scattering amplitudes becomes negligibly small but start to increase for finite doping .",
    "the average scattering from the a@xmath2 symmetric mode is small for both s- and d - wave channels since @xmath161 is only large when the form factor of the sc pairs is small .",
    "therefore as anticipated before the pairs can not take advantage from the correlation induced enhancement of the vertex in this case . for d - wave symmetry",
    "the effective el - el interaction even becomes slightly repulsive .",
    "notice that in the a@xmath2 channel the anisotropic s - wave scattering is slightly larger than that for isotropic s - wave pairs .",
    "however , upon analyzing eq .",
    "( [ eq : av ] ) we find that this effect is due to the normalization ( i.e. the denominator ) , whereas the numerator is larger for isotropic s - wave scattering as it should .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] the result for the full averaged pair scattering amplitude for both d- and s - wave symmetries .",
    "the inclusion of the hubbard derived quasiparticle repulsion eq .",
    "( [ eq : eexp ] ) in the interaction part leads to further separation between d- and s - wave symmetries .",
    "since this interaction is almost structureless in momentum space it mainly leads to a suppression of s - wave pair scattering ( mostly pronounced for isotropic s - wave ) whereas the d - wave pairs are only weakly affected .",
    "the latter feel the local coulomb interaction mainly in the mott - regime where at half - filling the corresponding scattering now also becomes repulsive .",
    "the inclusion of screening processes beyond @xmath159 via the rpa resummation starts to play a role at higher doping where it reduces the strong dependence of @xmath161 on @xmath113 . according to our investigations",
    "the attractive scattering of d - wave pairs in the b@xmath2 channel dominates for @xmath164 over the corresponding isotropic s - wave pairing and for @xmath165 remains the only attractive pairing symmetry within our model .",
    "it should be mentioned that the ga correctly describes band narrowing and the suppression of charge fluctuations but it fails to describe the emergence of the magnetic @xmath166 scale in the metal as the mott insulator is approached from the fermi liquid side .",
    "therefore our present approach does not capture pairing due to the exchange of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "accordingly , if we neglect the el - ph interaction the scattering amplitude becomes repulsive in all the channels considered .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to investigate the influence of an on - site electronic repulsion onto a transitive electron - phonon coupling within a single - band hubbard model .",
    "in contrast to similar calculations for a local holstein - type coupling @xcite where the electron - phonon vertex is suppressed for all momenta ( but most strongly for large @xmath167 ) , we have seen that a transitive el - ph interactions leads to a much more interesting interplay between electronic correlations and phonons .",
    "our finding that there can even be a correlation - induced enhancement of the pair scattering amplitude for certain momenta is especially important with regard to the anisotropy of the el - ph interaction in cuprate superconductors @xcite . in this regard our approach extends to the correlated regime , the analysis of refs . , which where based on a ( electronically ) non - interacting model .    the correlation - induced enhancement of the electron phonon interaction it is not followed by a similar enhancement of the overall influence of phonons on superconductivity .",
    "even in the present case the impact of phonons on superconductivity is suppressed by the coulomb interactions .",
    "this is because the enhancement happens in a channel that is not beneficial for @xmath168-wave superconductivity , namely @xmath67 , and also because it happens in a restricted momentum range .",
    "notwithstanding the effect on superconductivity , there may be a larger impact on other properties which are more sensitive to the local , rather than the global , momentum dependence like the appearance of kinks on the electron dispersion due to self - energy effects .",
    "also the enhancement of the scattering function at small momentum can play an important role in phase separation instabilities.@xcite    we have presented our results as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "a crucial question concerns the strength of electronic correlations in the high - t@xmath1 materials .",
    "in fact , the early classification of these compounds as doped mott insulators has recently been questioned in ref .  .",
    "this point of view agrees with our own estimate for @xmath169 as derived from a fitting to the spin - wave dispersion of undoped lanthanum cuprates @xcite and which is almost half the value of the brinkman - rice transition .    for @xmath170 we can deduce from fig .  [ fig : v2 ]",
    "that the scattering amplitude for d - wave scattering from the coupling to b@xmath2 modes is reduced by @xmath171 for @xmath172 , @xmath173 for @xmath138 , and @xmath174 for @xmath154 which should be compared with the @xmath175 increase when the plasmon frequency is increased to @xmath176 .",
    "@xcite thus even the inclusion of ( moderate ) correlation effects leaves a significant contribution of phonons to d - wave superconductivity .    in case of the hubbard - holstein model @xcite the electron - phonon vertex",
    "is determined by the local charge response function and it turned out that the tdga computation of this quantitiy is in rather good agreement with exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo results .",
    "since for the present case of a transitive coupling detailed computations from more sophisticated approaches are not yet available a detailed comparison concerning the performance of the tdga is not possible .",
    "at least our previous investigations of charge excitations on finite hubbard clusters ,  @xcite also including the optical conductivity as an intersite response function , suggest that the tdga is a reliable approach also for the issue investigated in the present paper .",
    "our present study may also have relevance for an understanding of the iron - based superconductors lifeas and nafeas which , contrary to the other pnictide compounds , do nt show magnetic order and have relatively low @xmath177@xcite which suggest that an electron - phonon mechanism may play an important role . on the other hand , density functional theory results @xcite in coupling parameters which are far too small in order to account for the observed transition temperature .",
    "recently , angle - resolved photoemission studies @xcite have revealed both , signatures of optical phonons and a significant electron - electron scattering rate in the spectra .",
    "one of the low energy phonon modes in the pnictides is an iron - arsenide bond - stretching phonon which affects the hopping between adjacent iron d - states in a manner similar as the one analyzed here for the buckling modes .",
    "thus a natural perspective of the present approach would be its combination with lda computations for multiband hubbard models in order to obtain a realistic estimate of correlation effects for the various phonon modes regarding their relevance for the sc pairing in low @xmath177 pnictides .",
