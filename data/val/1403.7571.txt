    "it has been gradually recognized that certain classes of non - closed symplectic manifolds admit symmetries of a new kind .",
    "these symmetries are not given by groups acting on the manifold , but instead appear as extra structure on floer cohomology , or more properly on the fukaya category .",
    "the first example may have been the bigrading on the floer cohomology of certain lagrangian spheres in the milnor fibres of type @xmath1 hypersurface singularities in @xmath2 , described in @xcite ( it turned out later ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 20 ) that this is compatible with the @xmath3-structure of the fukaya category only if @xmath4 ) .",
    "the geometric origin of such symmetries ( on the infinitesimal level ) has been studied in @xcite , with applications in @xcite .",
    "a roadmap is provided ( via mirror symmetry ) by the theory of equivariant coherent sheaves , and its applications in algebraic geometry and geometric representation theory ; the relevant literature is too vast to survey properly , but @xcite have been influential for the developments presented here .    in @xcite ,",

    "one gets a similar machinery for defining and computing algebraic analogues of the @xmath5-intersection numbers from @xcite . aside from their intrinsic interest , these @xmath5-intersection numbers have implications for the topology of lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "these are similar in spirit to those derived in @xcite , but benefit from the more rigid setup of @xmath0-actions , as well as the greater ease of doing computations in a purely algebraic framework .",
    "in particular , example [ th : q - mirrorp2 ] would be out of reach of the methods in @xcite , since those only involved the first derivative in the equivariant parameter @xmath5 around @xmath6 , whereas vanishes at least to order @xmath7 at that point .",
    "another noteworthy comparison is @xcite , which contains an example of a non - existence theorem for lagrangian submanifolds whose statement is of a similar kind to that in example [ th : q - mirrorp2 ] .",

    "there is a foundational question here , which is what one really means by `` the fukaya category admits a @xmath0-action '' .",
    "here , we use a simple ad hoc definition , which is not intrinsic : it amounts to saying that the fukaya category can be embedded into a larger category , and that the larger category carries a @xmath0-action in a more naive sense .",
    "certain questions , such as the persistence of the symmetry under deformations of the symplectic form , can not be meaningfully addressed in this framework . however , at present these are mostly theoretical shortcomings : while there are definitions of an action of @xmath0 ( or more general algebraic group ) on an @xmath3-category which are more satisfying , they have not yet led to substantially stronger applications in symplectic topology .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows :    * in section [ sec : review ] , we focus on the @xmath5-intersection numbers and their applications , leaving the categorical structures out of the picture as much as possible .",
