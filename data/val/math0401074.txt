    "algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of zero sets of algebraic polynomials @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "if we allow the exponents @xmath5 to be real vectors , @xmath6 becomes a multi - valued function .",
    "this can be remedied by an exponential change of variables @xmath7 , after which we obtain a single - valued exponential sum of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the vector of frequencies , @xmath10 is the vector of variables , and @xmath11 is the standard scalar product .",
    "some results from algebraic geometry can be generalized to this wider class of functions .",
    "for example , bernstein s theorem states that the number of zeros of a generic system of @xmath0 algebraic equations in @xmath12 with a fixed collection of newton polyhedra is equal to @xmath13 times the mixed volume of the newton polyhedra of the system .",
    "a system of @xmath0 exponential equations in @xmath0 variables usually has infinitely many isolated zeros , thus one has to study the distribution of these zeros in order to obtain finite invariants .",
    "o.  gelfond proved that the mean number of complex zeros of a system of @xmath0 exponential sums in @xmath0 variables with real frequencies whose newton polyhedra have sufficiently general mutual positions ( so - called developed collection of newton polyhedra ) , is equal to @xmath13 times the mixed volume of the newton polyhedra of the system @xcite .",
    "o.  gelfond and a.  khovanskii found a formula for the sum of the values of a laurent polynomial at the zeros of a system of @xmath0 laurent polynomials in @xmath14 with a developed collection of newton polyhedra @xcite .",
    "this formula splits into two components .",
    "one of them is geometrical and reflects the mutual positions of the newton polyhedra of the system , while the other component is expressed explicitly in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial and the system .",
    "an exponential change of variables gives a similar formula for exponential sums with rational frequencies .",
    "we conjecture that this formula also holds for exponential sums with real frequencies .",
    "here is some evidence for this .",
    "if the exponential sum that we are summing up is identically equal to one , the formula follows from combining two results : gelfond s generalization of bernstein s theorem @xcite and the new formula for the mixed volume @xcite . in @xcite the conjectured formula is proved in dimension one .",
    "the conjectured formula , first of all , implies that the mean value exists .",
    "we prove the existence not only in the complex situation but also in a very general real setting by providing an integral formula for the mean value .    if the frequencies of the exponential sum that we are summing up are not commensurate with the frequencies of the system the conjectured formula states that the mean value is equal to zero . we show that this is actually true and therefore prove the conjectured formula in most cases .",
    "for example , if the exponential sum that we are summing up is a single exponent @xmath15 , @xmath16 , then the formula is proved for all values of @xmath5 except for a countable set in @xmath17 .",
    "our arguments represent a combination of real analytic geometry and ergodic theory .",
    "they are based on two theorems from completely different parts of mathematics : the cell - decomposition theorem for subanalytic sets ( appendix b ) and weyl s equidistribution law for multidimensional trajectories in the real torus ( appendix a ) .",
    "weyl s equidistribution law for one - dimensional trajectories is a classical theorem which was published in 1916 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of the corresponding law for multidimensional trajectories in @xcite is a direct generalization of weyl s original argument .",
    "_ remarks . _ similar ideas first appeared in weyl s papers @xcite and @xcite where he solves the mean motion problem .",
    "s.  gusein - zade and a.  esterov were dealing with related questions and were using close techniques in @xcite to prove the existence of the mean euler characteristic and mean betti numbers of level sets and sets of smaller values of a quasiperiodic function .",
    "their motivation is completely different from ours : it comes from the analysis of some models of chaotic behavior appearing in quasicrystal structures .",

    "we first show that the dimension of the orbit @xmath68 is @xmath210 .",
    "it is enough to show that the dimension of the plane @xmath211 is @xmath0 .",
    "this plane is generated by the columns of the matrix of the linear map @xmath212 .",
    "the rows of this matrix are the generators @xmath188 of the group @xmath129 .",

    "it is easy to see that there are no integral vectors orthogonal to the orbit @xmath68 . therefore , the orbit @xmath68 is dense in the torus @xmath196 ( see lemma  [ l : nointegral ] ) .    to derive theorem  [ t : compmain ] from theorem  [ t : general ]",
