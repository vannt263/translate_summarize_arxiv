    "the concept of entanglement has evolved since it has first appeared in 1935 , as a `` spooky action at a distance '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , the possibility of one system to influence another instantaneously , even at large distances @xcite . only in 1964 , john bell moved the concept from the philosophical debates to the laboratory , using inequalities - now known as bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "entanglement was then a property of states which could not be described by realistic local theories .",
    "perhaps the more drastic evolution of the concept came in 1989 , with the work of r. f. werner @xcite .",
    "werner defined entangled states as the ones which could not be created using local operations on the systems with classical communication between the parts ; these operations may create only classical correlations .",
    "however , werner surprisingly found mixed states which were entangled , according to his definition , but did not violate the bell inequality .",
    "entanglement and non - locality became distinct , but related , concepts .    even though entanglement has all these facets , the word is usually used to designate quantum correlations that are `` stronger '' than classical ones . on the other hand , phase transitions ( _ e.g. _ , magnetic phase )",
    "are generally related to an emerging order with origin in long range correlations .",
    "quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) are the ones occurring at zero temperature , where the systems is in a pure quantum state .",
    "therefore , we may expect these long range correlations to come from entanglement .",
    "studies trying to link entanglement and qpt first appeared in 2002 for specific models @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown that , in principle , entanglement should inherit the non - analytical behavior of the ground state energy at any qpt ; since both originate in the ground state @xcite .",
    "however , accidental non - analytical behavior may also appear , or disappear , due to the maximization process involved in entanglement definitions @xcite .",
    "nowadays , there are many studies concerning the link between entaglement and qpt .",
    "their results can be favorable or unfavorable to it , depending of the specific model and the measurement of entanglement used ( for a review see @xcite ) . nonetheless , to find such a link , all these studies used the werner definition of entanglement and did not analyze non - local properties of the states .    in this work ,",
    "we complement the study of the relation between entanglement and qpt , analyzing the non - local aspects of quantum phase transition using bell inequalities . _",
    "the objective is to find : i ) if entangled states , that may play a role in a quantum phase transition , are also non - local ; ii ) if the bell inequality is able to signal qpt_. we argue that , in principle , the bell inequality should also signal quantum phase transitions . a particular case of two spins in an infinite one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 xxz heisenberg chain",
    "was then studied .",
    "the study of non - local aspects of qpt is very recent , with only one analysis of a particular case of the one dimensional xy heisenberg chain with a transverse magnetic field published@xcite .    in order to be",
    "self contained , we organize the article as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief introduction about entanglement and non - locality through bell inequality , highlighting its differences . sec .",
    "iii describes the xxz model and its relevant quantities , in particular how to compute its correlation functions .",
    "the mathematical expression for the entanglement and bell inequalities in the specific case of the xxz model are given in sec .",
    "iv . the main results and a detailed discussion of their implications are in sec .",
    "v and we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "bell inequalities investigate correlations between two parties who share a quantum state . in the case of two spins 1/2 particles , each side , a and b , choose one direction , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and measures , simultaneously and independently , the observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; with @xmath5 .",
    "if each part picks two directions , bell inequalities state that any theory which is _ both realistic and local _ gives    @xmath6    the value obtained for @xmath7 depends both on the state and on the directions chosen .",
    "so , for a given state one should maximize over all directions defining a bell measurement as :    @xmath8    the states for which @xmath9 are the ones which can not be described by a realistic local theory and were then associated with non - classical correlation or non - locality .",
    "clearly , states which can be written in a product or separable form , @xmath10 , are local .",
    "these states are known as separable or not entangled .    in 1989 , werner @xcite proposed a definition of separability for mixed states from an operational point of view : separable states are the ones which can be produced by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "they can be written as @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "separable mixed states can be correlated , but this correlation is a classical one that comes from the probabilities @xmath14 .",
    "surprisingly , in the same work , werner constructed states which are entangled by his definition , but nonetheless do not violate the bell inequality .",
    "entanglement , although necessary , is not a sufficient condition for a mixed state to be nonlocal ; bell inequality does not capture all `` kinds of entanglement '' .    for pure bipartite states , only in 1991 ,",
    "gisin proved that entanglement is a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be non - local @xcite . until nowadays , there are many attempts to draw a unifying picture between non - locality and entanglement by generalizing the bell inequality .",
    "popescu , in 1995 , for example , showed that an entangled state not violating bell , could be made to violate it after some processing with locc @xcite .",
    "another possibility , is to allow each part to make a measurement in a third direction .",
    "this originates a new inequality that is violated by states which do not violated chsh inequality @xcite . for a introduction and review on similar attempts see @xcite",
    "there are also many other definitions of non - locality , and all of them show some anomaly with entanglement @xcite . for example , while for two qubits pure states the degree of violation of the bell inequality is a increasing function of the entanglement of the state , this is not true for two qudits",
    ". finally , there are also other definitions of quantum correlation , as the discord which has also been studied at quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "we now describe the physics of the model we intend to use to study the relationship between entanglement and non - locality : an one dimensional spin-@xmath0 chain where the spins interact through anisotropic heisenberg interaction .",
    "it is known as xxz model and for n particles its hamiltonian is given by @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 are the pauli spin-@xmath0 operators on site @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath21 .",
    "the xxz model can not be diagonalized , but its energy spectrum can be obtained by bethe ansatz .",
    "the hamiltonian has two symmetries : i ) a discrete parity @xmath22 symmetry over the plane @xmath23 : @xmath24 , and ii ) a continuous @xmath25 symmetry that rotates the spins in the @xmath26 plane by any angle @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetry implies that @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while the @xmath25 symmetry implies that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , in the thermodynamical limit a quantum phase transition occur and breaks the discrete @xmath22 symmetry ; a continuous symmetry may not be broken at one - dimension even at zero temperature .",
    "the model has three phases :    i ) : :    @xmath33 : the system is in a ferromagnetic phase    with all the spins pointing in the same direction .",
    "there is a first    order quantum phase transitions ( 1qpt ) at the critical point    @xmath34 .",
    "ii ) : :    @xmath35 : the system is in a gapless phase , where the    correlation decays polynomially .",
    "iii ) : :    @xmath36 : the system is in the anti - ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the critical point at @xmath37 is of infinite order or    kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transitions ( kt - qpt ) .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution gives the ground state energy @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath36 we just need to change @xmath40 in ( 6 ) .",
    "the correlation functions , on the other hand , can not be easily obtained from the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "they are given in terms of very complicated multiple integrals , and solving them is a non trivial mathematical problem .",
    "however , for nearest neighbors we can obtain the correlation from @xmath41 :    @xmath42    @xmath43    for spins further apart , progress has been slow , but there are already some expressions available up to third neighbors @xcite .",
    "we will not show them here , since they are too lengthy .. in ( 20 ) we need to go to @xcite ( note that equation ( 5.4 ) has the same typo ) and use equations ( 5.10 ) , ( b.11 ) and ( b.12 ) to calculate and find the typo in @xmath44    we are interested in the entanglement and non - local properties of two spins in the chain .",
    "these can be determined by the reduced density matrix of the two spins , which can be obtained from the magnetizations and correlations .",
    "actually , the density matrix of any two spins-@xmath0can be expressed as @xmath45,\\ ] ] with @xmath46 being the distance between the sites , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . due to the hamiltonian symmetries ,",
    "only @xmath50 do not vanish and @xmath51 .",
    "translation invariance also implies that the correlation functions for two - sites depend only on the distance between the sites ( @xmath46 ) , being independent of @xmath52 .",
    "so for the xxz model we have @xmath53    remark that in the ordered phases , ferro and anti - ferromagnetic , due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , a finite value of the magnetization will emerge : @xmath54 .",
    "this should be taken into account , complicating a little bit the expression for @xmath55 .",
    "however , in many studies this is not done , and the simpler expression , preserving the symmetries , is used . in this case , the ground state used is not the one which breaks the symmetry and is stable against external perturbations , but a superposition of the two degenerated ground states with opposite magnetizations .",
    "this could be justified for the study of very small systems where the ssb does not happen , but not for real macroscopic systems .",
    "it is true , however , that all the thermodynamical quantities , which comes from the energy eigenvalues , are not affected by this choice .",
    "nonetheless , entanglement properties may be affected by this choice , since it also depends on the eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "last , besides the symmetric superposition of the two ground states , one could also think of an equiproportional mixture of the two , that would emerge if one takes the limit of temperature going to zero .",
    "in general , checking a bell inequality violation is a high - dimensional variational problem .",
    "we have to optimize over the various possible measurements settings that each observer performs ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell operator ] ) ) .",
    "one simplification is that the value of @xmath56 and @xmath57 does not depend on local properties , the magnetizations @xmath58 and @xmath59 , but only on the correlations @xmath60 . for two spin-@xmath0 particles a closed analytic expression for the maximum violation of the bell inequality",
    "was obtained by the horodeckis @xcite and is given in in terms of the matrix @xmath61 by @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 the two largest eigenvalues of @xmath65 and @xmath66 the @xmath67 matrix build from the correlations @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath63 and @xmath64 are combinations of the correlation functions , we can rewrite it in terms of the correlations .",
    "the expression for @xmath68 in terms of the correlations is very cumbersome for general states .",
    "but , because of the symmetries of the xxz model , see eq . ( [ eq : rho xxz ] )",
    ", it becomes quite simple .",
    "in fact , the matrix @xmath66 is already diagonal , with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as its diagonal elements and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath65 are @xmath73 and @xmath74 and we only have to check which is greater . the expression becomes @xmath75 to have non - locality , we need either    * i)@xmath76    or    * ii)@xmath77    to compare the non - locality with entanglement between the two spins , we will use the concurrence as our entanglement measure ; see @xcite for a review on entanglement measures .",
    "it is a well defined entanglement measure and is given in terms of the spectrum of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the time - reversed density matrix .",
    "let @xmath80 be the eigenvalues of @xmath78 so that @xmath81",
    ". then the concurrence is @xmath82    the concurrence can also be written in terms of the correlation functions , but in general the expression is also very cumbersome , since it comes from solving a polynomial of fourth degree .",
    "as in the case of the bell inequality , due to the symmetries , for the xxz model the expression is simple and given by @xcite @xmath83    as mentioned before , the bell inequality is not directly affected by local properties , the magnetizations , but only depends on the correlations , given by the matrix @xmath66 .",
    "the concurrence , however , may be affected , since the local magnetizations may appear in its expression .",
    "( [ eq : concurrence ] ) is only valid when the magnetizations and off - diagonal correlations are null ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , and no simple expression can be obtained in terms of the correlation for the general case .",
    "this may have consequences to the effect of the spontaneous symmetry breaking on these properties .",
    "in the case of the xxz model , the ssb manifests itself with a finite value of @xmath86 , which could in principle change the value of the concurrence , but not of the bell inequality .",
    "however , as showed in @xcite , it turns out that for the xxz model the concurrence does not change when the ssb is taken into account .",
    "before showing the results of non - locality and compare with the entanglement , let us look at the ground state energy per site @xmath87 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "we can see the non - analytical behavior of @xmath88 at the 1qpt @xmath34 and the nonexistence of non - analyticities at the kt - qpt at @xmath37 .",
    "we also show the correlation functions for first , second and third neighbors in figs .",
    "[ fig : correlation xx ] and [ fig : correlation zz ] .",
    "a non - analytical behavior can also be seen at @xmath34 , and at least for first neighbors , it is directly related to the one found in @xmath87 .",
    "correlation function in the @xmath89 direction , @xmath90 , for first , second and third neighbors of the xxz model as a function of the anisotropy @xmath20 .",
    "it can be seen that the correlation is able to signal the first order quantum phase transition at @xmath34 , but not the infinite order quantum phase transition at @xmath37.,title=\"fig : \" ]    correlation function in the @xmath91 direction , @xmath92 , for first , second and third neighbors of the xxz model as a function of the anisotropy @xmath20 .",
    "it can be seen that the correlation is able to signal the first order quantum phase transition at @xmath34 , but not the infinite order quantum phase transition at @xmath37.,title=\"fig : \" ]    last , we review the results of the bipartite entanglement between two spins , first obtained in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bell ] we observe that the entanglement of first neighbors suddenly appears as they enter the gapless phase , achieve the maximum at the kt - qpt , and slowly decrease in anti - ferromagnetic phase .",
    "second and third neighbors are only slight entangled and in a small region on the right of the 1qpt ; the curves can barely be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bell ] .",
    "the first order phase transition is indicated by the non - analytical behavior of the concurrence of all the first three neighbors : its first derivative diverges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : derivative ] for the case of first neighbors )    we now present our results .",
    "first we argue that the bell inequality may be as good as entanglement to signal the qpt .",
    "the argument is equivalent and follows directly from the one used in @xcite for bipartite entanglement and in @xcite for multipartite : for hamiltonians with only nearest - neighbors interactions not only the entanglement between nearest - neighbors spins , but also @xmath87 can be obtained from the reduced density matrix of the two spins ; they are functions of @xmath93 .",
    "so any non - analytical behavior in @xmath94 will also appear in the entanglement @xmath95 , unless the the specific form of the functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 cause the non - analitycal behavior or originate accidental cancellations ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "note that while @xmath96 is a linear function of @xmath98 @xmath97 involves the absolute value of @xmath93 and maximizations or minimizations procedures .",
    "but such analyze is also trivially true for any property of the two spins , since they are completely determined by @xmath93 , including the bell measure . _",
    "therefore @xmath57 is , in principle , as good as any entanglement measure to signal a qpt_. but as in the case of entanglement accidental cancellations may also happen due to the complicated form @xmath57 depends on @xmath93 : it also involves the absolute value of @xmath93 and a maximization .",
    "note that signaling the qpt is not the only interest when studying the behavior of entanglement or non - locality at qpt .",
    "one could also learn about the nature of the correlations involved in the qpt , as we will argue in the following when looking at the specific case of the xxz model .",
    "given the general argument , we move to our results for the case of the xxz model . the value of the bell measurement , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell xxz ] ) , is shown in the upper curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : bell ] for first ( solid blue curve ) , second ( dashed red curve ) and third ( doted yellow curve ) neighbors .",
    "we observe that none of them violate the bell inequality , despite being entangled .",
    "but lets first concentrate on the analytical properties of @xmath57 .",
    "as it may be expected from the arguments above , it is able to indicate the qpts .",
    "furthermore , _ not only the first order qpt is revealed by @xmath57 , but also the kosterlitz - thouless qpt , which is neither indicated by _ _ the energy nor by the bipartite entanglement given in terms of the concurrence_. this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : derivative ] where we plot the derivatives of the bell measurement @xmath99 and the concurrence @xmath100 for nearest neighbors .",
    "it shows that while the derivative of both diverges at the first order quantum phase transition ( @xmath34 ) , only the derivative of the bell measurement signal the infinite order quantum phase transition ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the success of @xmath57 in revealing the kt - qpt comes from the maximization process , which is usually associated with negative results in the ability of entanglement to signal a qpt .",
    "more specifically , analyzing eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell xxz ] ) , we find out that while in the ferro and anti - ferromagnetic phase @xmath101 and @xmath102 , in the gapless phase @xmath103 and @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - analytical behavior of @xmath57 at the first order qpt does originate in @xmath105 or in @xmath87 .",
    "just to contrast , we should mention that the non - analytical behavior of the concurrence does not come from the non - analyticities in @xmath87 , but from the maximization involved in the concurrence .",
    "note also that at the kt - qpt the first neighbor concurrence is maximum , while all the next neighbors are null almost in the whole phase .",
    "however , even though one can show that , in general , the concurrence may inherit the non - analytical behavior of @xmath87 , it is not possible to show that it should be maximum at the critical point .",
    "therefore , such a behavior , should not be an indication of a qpt and may be specific to the xxz model ; in fact it has been interpreted as a consequence of the specific symmetries of the model ( see sec .",
    "iv - a-2 of @xcite ) . it would be interest to know if the behavior of @xmath57 at the kt - qpt is also only specific to this model .",
    "last , let us comment on the non - violation of the bell inequality for nearest - neighbors , our third result .",
    "it is unexpectedly , since these spins are entangled , and not only slightly .",
    "they have a kind of hidden entanglement , similar to the one present in the werner states , that is not revealed by the bell inequality , being in this sense local .",
    "that entanglement may be relevant for quantum phase transitions has been suggested by many works @xcite . _",
    "our results complements such works , _ _ indicating that the kind of entanglement that is relevant for qpt is not trivial : it can not be revealed by the bell inequality_. note that , one may argue that this should be expected since we are studying two particles in a huge chain in a pure highly entangled state .",
    "thus , these two particles are in very mixed states close to the identity and should not violate the bell inequality . but",
    "this argument also applies to entanglement : the two particles should not be entangled . in our case",
    "they are , and not slightly .",
    "in fact , despite even slight entangled states may violate bell , the number of states violating bell and the degree of violation increase with the amount of the entanglement @xcite .",
    "we also observe that second and third neighbors do not violate bell , but these are only weakly entangled in a tiny region of the phase diagram .",
    "note that , even tough our states have a behavior similar to werner states , they are not werner states . only at @xmath37 can our state be written in the form of a werner state .",
    "thus , these are a new class of entangled states , which do not violate the bell inequality .",
    "our results can be visualized geometrically in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter - space ] , where we have the parameter space of density matrices of two spin-@xmath0 particles with the symmetries of the xxz hamiltonian .",

    "we can see that it increases in the direction of the lower vertices of the greatest triangle .",
    "the contour lines of the bell inequality are parallel to the lines defining the border of the region nl , but not show .",
    "we also plotted the `` trajectory '' of @xmath105 for @xmath109 as the parameter @xmath20 is varied . for all the curves we marked fours points that corresponds to @xmath34 ( full circle ) , -0.999 ( square ) , 0 ( triangle ) and 1 ( diamond ) . the whole ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath33 )",
    "is represented by the full circle . as we move from the ferromagnetic phase in the direction of the gapless ( @xmath35 ) there is a jump at the point @xmath34 .",
    "the state of @xmath93 ( solid blue curve ) and @xmath110(dotted yellow ) jumps through the left side , entering the entangled region , while @xmath111 ( red dashed curve ) jump to the entangled region through the right side .",

    "then , we studied the particular case of two spins in an one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 xxz infinite chain at zero temperature and found that : i ) _ the bell inequality is not only able to reveal the first order quantum phase transition , but also the kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition .",
