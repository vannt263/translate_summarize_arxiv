    "quantum dipolar systems of bosons and fermions have gathered much experimental and theoretical attention in recent years . in 2005 ,",
    "griesmaier and collaborators  @xcite on one side , and stuhler and collaborators  @xcite on the other , reported on the first experimental realization of a bose condensate of @xmath0cr , where the dipolar moment of the atoms is so large ( @xmath1 ) that the effect of the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction is comparable in strength to the van der waals forces .",
    "more recently , new and exciting results have been achieved with polar molecules of rubidium and potassium ( @xmath2k@xmath3rb )  @xcite , which have not been easy to create due to strong loss rates in the population induced by chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "a promising route towards a molecular bose - einstein condensate is feshbach association of rb and cs , which are not reactive  @xcite .",
    "one of the major advantages of polar molecules is that the electric dipole moments are remarkably larger than in the magnetic case of @xmath0cr and can be tuned by applying an external electric field .",
    "systems of polar molecules have been speculated to present interesting applications ranging from the control of chemical reactions  @xcite to practical applications of quantum information theory  @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , dipolar systems present novel and interesting phenomena that make them particularly appealing . on the one hand ,",
    "the anisotropic character of the dipole - dipole interaction introduces additional degrees of freedom compared with other condensed matter systems that can potentially enrich the phase diagram . on the other ,",
    "the interaction decreases at large distances as @xmath4 and becomes long ranged in three dimensions ( 3d ) , in contrast to typical van der waals forces . in two dimensions ( 2d ) ,",
    "though , the interaction is still short ranged but at the border between both regimes .",
    "the potential @xmath5 describing how two dipoles with dipolar moments @xmath6 and @xmath7 interact is given by @xmath8 \\label{dipdipv}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 the relative position vector between them and @xmath10 the coupling constant defining the strength of the interaction . for permanent magnetic dipoles",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the permeability of vacuum and @xmath13 is the permanent dipole moment of the atoms .",
    "alternatively , the electric dipole moment can be induced by an electric field @xmath14 , and in this case the coupling constant is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 with @xmath17 the static polarizability and @xmath18 the permitivity of vacuum . for a system of fully polarized dipoles in 2d as the ones considered here ,",

    "stand for the in - plane distance and polar angle , respectively .",
    "notice that , in contrast to what happens in three dimensions , @xmath22 is fixed in the fully polarized system and thus @xmath26 is a constant of the problem for a given @xmath22 .     with the @xmath27 axis.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "one of the consequences of the form of the interaction is that it can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the orientation with respect to the polarization field .",
    "this fact alone triggers interesting discussions about the static and dynamic properties of dipolar systems .",
    "for instance , the formation of a density instability observed in the elementary excitation spectrum as the formation of a deep roton minimum has been widely discussed  @xcite , a feature that is absent when the interaction is reduced to its purely isotropic limit in 2d  @xcite corresponding to @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ dipdipv2d ] ) .",
    "the presence of two- and/or many - body bound states in stacks of dipolar layers has also raised interesting questions  @xcite .",
    "many other aspects including scattering properties in 2d  @xcite , pseudopotential treatments  @xcite or the impact of the anisotropy on the superfluid properties of a dipolar bose gas  @xcite have gathered interest in the recent years .",
    "most of these aspects and many others are covered in detail in the review article by lahaye _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the case where the interaction is always repulsive , but is still anisotropic .",
    "that defines a critical angle @xmath29 above which @xmath19 starts to present negative contributions .",
    "we thus analyze the role of the anisotropy of the interaction in situations where the system is clearly prevented from collapse .",
    "since @xmath30 is reached at @xmath31 , we propose to use @xmath32 as an expansion parameter .    despite the relevance of the anisotropic character of the interaction in all these effects , not much effort",
    "has been put in the microscopic description of the wave function .",
    "the anisotropy makes the different angular momentum channels couple in a non - trivial way , and that introduces additional degrees of freedom that must be taken into account in a numerical simulation . at low densities ,",
    "though , the problem simplifies since the zero - energy solution of the two - body scattering problem dominates the ground state many - body wave function of the homogeneous gaseous phase . in this work",
    "we provide a detailed description of the zero - energy scattering wave function corresponding to two dipoles moving on the plane , as a function of the polarization angle .",
    "equipped with that solution we build a microscopic variational many - body wave function that we use in a monte carlo simulation to describe the static properties of a gas of polarized dipoles in 2d at low densities .    the analysis of the low density equation of state of a gas of weakly interacting particles has historically attracted great interest .",
    "corrections to the mean field prediction for three - dimensional  @xcite and one - dimensional  @xcite systems have been known for more that fifty years now .",
    "the two - dimensional case has been much more controversial as already the two - body problem presents logarithmic divergences in the leading scattering parameters that make series expansions difficult to carry out  @xcite . in any case , the low density behavior of a gas of weakly interacting particles in 2d has been widely discussed in the literature for the case of isotropic interactions .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties exhibited by these systems is the _",
    "universal _ behavior of the energy per particle , which admits a non ",
    "analytic series expansion in the gas parameter @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the density and @xmath35 the @xmath36wave scattering length .",
    "the leading order , mean - field term in this series has been derived by several authors  @xcite and reads @xmath37 the detailed form of the next - to - leading correction to this expression have been the subject of discussion and different authors proposed different forms in the past , see for instance refs .",
    "the correct expression was recently derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and checked against numerically intense monte carlo simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the model system of hard disks , the mean field prediction of eq .",
    "( [ elo ] ) holds well starting at @xmath38 and down to quite low but still experimentally affordable values of the gas parameter  @xcite .",
    "however , no particular attention has been paid in all these works to the special case of anisotropic interactions .    in this article",
    "we discuss to which extent the mean field law of eq .",
    "( [ elo ] ) holds for the special case of the spatially anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction of eq .",
    "( [ dipdipv2d ] ) when the polarization angle varies between 0 and @xmath30 .",
    "we are particularly interested in discerning whether the angular dependence of the interaction has a noticeable impact on the mean - field prediction of eq .",
    "( [ elo ] ) and on other relevant ground state properties .",
    "in order to do that , we first solve in section ii the zero - energy two - body scattering problem and obtain an expression for the scattering length as a function of the polarization angle .",
    "we then use this result to build in section iii a variational many - body wave function of the jastrow form that we use as an input to both a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and a diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations from where we obtain the equation of state as a function of @xmath23 . for the sake of completeness we also analyze the pair distribution function , the static structure factor , the one - body density matrix and the condensate fraction , and discuss how these quantities scale on the gas parameter for different polarization angles and densities .",
    "finally , in section iv the main conclusions of the work are summarized and discussed .",
    "in this section we develop a series expansion of the zero energy scattering solution for two dipoles moving on the xy plane as a function of the polarization angle @xmath22 .",
    "this is done by first building the green s function of the @xmath39 case corresponding to a polarization field perpendicular to the plane .",
    "this is a particularly suitable situation since in that case the interaction is isotropic ( @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ dipdipv2d ] ) ) and the schrdinger equation can be exactly solved .",
    "from there we carry out a series expansion in powers of @xmath32 of the solution corresponding to the anisotropic case .",
    "the anisotropy makes the different angular momentum channels couple , and we report the expression for all orders in @xmath32 contributing to each partial wave .",
    "we end this section reporting the scattering length of the dipole - dipole interaction as a function of the polarization angle , required afterwards to analyze the low density properties of the anisotropic many - body system .",

    "the two linearly independent solutions of the zero energy schrdinger equation ( se ) for the isotropic case are the building blocks we need in order to generate the green s function that we will use afterwards to solve the anisotropic case . setting @xmath28",
    ", the se of the relative motion of the two dipoles at zero energy reduces to @xmath45 and the general solution of this equation can be expanded in partial waves as @xmath46 where the wave function of each separate mode @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 which is a modified bessel equation for @xmath49 .",
    "the two linearly independent solutions of eq .",
    "( [ diffeqe0 ] ) are @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xcite , and these two functions enter in the green s function we write below . the zero energy solution of the se requires the condition @xmath52 to be zero , and that discards the @xmath51 contributions .",
    "apart from a normalization constant , the zero energy solution of the @xmath28 problem becomes then @xmath53 the physical solution of the isotropic case corresponds to @xmath54 as otherwise anisotropic contributions would dominate at large distances since @xmath55 grows as @xmath56 when @xmath57 . in 1d and 3d ,",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath58 solution allows one to immediately obtain an exact expression for the @xmath36wave scattering length @xmath59 .",
    "the description of two - body scattering in 2d is more involved since the low - energy expansion of the scattering amplitude diverges at low energies , thus introducing additional problems not found in higher and lower dimensions .",
    "the scattering length @xmath59 can however be defined to be equal to the position of the node of the asymptotic form of the zero energy two - body wave function .",
    "this definition has the additional advantage that can be used in any dimensions and will therefore be adopted throughout this work  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath24 behavior of @xmath60 is @xmath61 and that yields the well known expression @xmath62 where @xmath63 is euler s gamma constant .",
    "the se describing the anisotropic case can be cast in the form @xmath64 and the general solution for @xmath65 can be derived from the green s function corresponding to @xmath28 , which fulfills the equation @xmath66 leading to @xmath67 with @xmath68 the @xmath28 solution as described above .    equation  ( [ vecgreen ] ) can be solved expanding the green s function in partial waves as before @xmath69\\ ] ] where @xmath70 satisfies the boundary condition @xmath71 while keeping it bounded at large distances . the general solution of the fredholm integral equation  ( [ lippmann ] ) admits a series expansion in powers of @xmath32 @xmath72 where each @xmath73 satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath74 when @xmath75 is further expanded in partial waves and the bose symmetry is taken into account @xmath76 the coupling between the different angular momentum channels produced by the @xmath77 term of the interaction emerges and the radial functions satisfy the following recurrence relations for even @xmath34 @xmath78    \\label{recurrence_phink}\\ ] ] that can be solved iteratively starting from @xmath79 . from this expression one sees that by adding successive orders in @xmath32 to the series expansion of @xmath80 , more angular momentum channels couple together . as in the regime considered the interaction is fully repulsive , @xmath81 and that makes @xmath32 a small parameter that we can use in a series expansion of the solution .",
    "in fact , it can be shown from the previous expressions that @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and that therefore the lowest order contribution to the @xmath34-th mode is @xmath84 . by adding @xmath85 for all @xmath86 and fixed @xmath34 one recovers @xmath87 , the complete @xmath88 mode contribution to @xmath80 .",
    "we thus find @xmath89 which means that , up to a given order @xmath90 , the total wave function @xmath80 has contributions coming only from channels @xmath91 .",

    "the latter angle is fairly close to the critical angle @xmath29 where the interaction ceases to be purely repulsive . at @xmath96",
    "the contribution of the @xmath97 modes is expected to be larger than for any lower angle .",

    "these cuts coincide with the directions where the interaction is least and most repulsive , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , anisotropic effects are visible in both cases but are more pronounced at high polarization angles .",

    "in this section we extend the previous discussion and analyze , using dmc and vmc methods , the most relevant ground state properties of an homogeneous and anisotropic gas of bosonic dipoles with a polarization angle @xmath22 lower than the critical angle @xmath29 .",
    "we stick to the low density limit were the system , characterized by a fully repulsive and anisotropic interaction , remains in a stable , gaseous phase .",
    "one of the most relevant quantities to analyze at low densities is the total energy per particle of the gas and its universal scaling properties .",
    "quite a lot of work has been devoted in the past to that question , including both 3d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite systems .",
    "however , little has been discussed about the same properties in anisotropic systems as the dipolar gas considered here .",
    "we analyze the impact of the polarization angle @xmath22 formed by the dipoles on the universality scaling law exhibited by other isotropic , short ranged interactions .",

    "the leading ground state quantities describing the low density static properties of the system can be obtained using different techniques . in this work",
    "we stick to diffusion and variational monte carlo methods , widely used nowadays in the analysis of weakly and strongly correlated systems .",
    "variational monte carlo samples stochastically a trial wave function and yields an upper bound to the real ground state energy of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "diffusion monte carlo uses also a trial wave function to guide the sampling process but removes the contributions from excited states to finally yield statistically exact energies . in both cases , however , a suitable variational wave function is required .",
    "the quality of the results is directly related to the quality of the wave function employed in the vmc case , while dmc is far less demanding and any reasonable guiding function can be used as long as it is not orthogonal to the true ground state . but even in dmc a high quality wave function makes the method converge faster and with smaller variance towards the exact result .",
    "consequently , seeking for a good trial many - body wave function @xmath127 is always desirable .    in this work we use a model wave function of the jastrow form @xmath128 where the two - body correlation factor @xmath129 depends on the position vector linking particles @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "one significant difference between this jastrow factor and the ones most commonly employed in the analysis of other condensed matter systems is that , due to the anisotropic character of the interaction , @xmath130 depends explicitly on the whole @xmath9 vector and not only on its magnitude .",
    "in this way , the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ jastrow - b1 ] ) describes an homogeneous but anisotropic system as the one under study .    at low densities",
    ", the zero - energy scattering solution of the two - body problem greatly influences the structural properties of the gas . for that reason we use as a jastrow factor the anisotropic solution of the relative motion of two dipoles on the plane derived in the previous section .",
