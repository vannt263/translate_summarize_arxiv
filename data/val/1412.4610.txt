    "neutron stars must be one of the most suitable environments to examine the physics under extreme conditions . the density inside the star can be much more than the nuclear saturation density , @xmath3 g/@xmath4 , and its gravitational binding energy becomes too large , such as @xmath5 with the stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) and radius ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . via the observations of the phenomena associated with the compact objects , one might reveal not only the equation of state ( eos ) and nuclear properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but also the gravitational theory itself ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the observations of pulsars tell us that the neutron stars generally have a strong magnetic field , such as @xmath8 gauss @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existence of another class of neutron stars , the so - called magnetars , is also suggested observationally @xcite .",
    "the surface magnetic field of magnetars can reach as large as @xmath9 gauss , which is determined through the measurements of the rotational period and spin down rate of soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite . according to the population statistics of soft gamma repeaters ,",
    "even @xmath10 of the neutron stars produced via supernovae are expected to be magnetars @xcite .",
    "the origin of such a strong magnetic field of neutron star is still uncertain .",
    "maybe , a simple model is caused by fossil magnetic field of progenitor star .",
    "that is , a small magnetic field in progenitor star would be amplified during the gravitational collapse with conserving the magnetic flux , which produces the strong magnetic field of neutron star @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this hypothesis could be difficult to be accepted for magnetars , because the stellar radius with the canonical mass of @xmath11 should be less than the schwarzshild radius defined by @xmath12 to produce a strong surface magnetic field such as @xmath13 gauss @xcite .",
    "another possibility of the generation mechanism is due to the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism , i.e. , the rapidly rotation of protoneutron star with the rotational period smaller than 3 ms may amplify a seed magnetic field up to @xmath13 gauss @xcite .",
    "this scenario is also unfavorable from the observations of supernova remnants associated with the magnetar candidates @xcite .",
    "additionally , the possibility of the ferromagnetism of quark liquid inside the neutron star is suggested as an origin of a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "conceivably , the hint to solve the open question about the origin of strong magnetic field of neutron star , might lay behind the magnetized properties in the core region .",
    "furthermore , the exact structure of neutron stars is still unclear , because the eos of neutron star matter , especially for high density region , is not fixed yet .",
    "even so , it is believed that , under the surface ocean composed of molten metal , the neutron - rich nuclei form a lattice structure through the coulomb interaction , which is usually called a crust region @xcite . as the energy density increases up to @xmath14 , the nuclei in the crust region would melt into uniform matter .",
    "this region corresponds to the core of neutron stars .",
    "moreover , non - hadronic matter , such as quarks , might appear in deeper part of core region , depending on the theoretical model of neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "in particular , the neutron star having quark matter is referred to as the hybrid star . inside the hybrid star",
    ", one has only to consider three flavor quark matter composed of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 quarks , because the more massive quarks can not be produced under the typical energy density of neutron stars .",
    "since quark matter makes eos soft , the mass of hybrid star is usually expected to be small . in practice ,",
    "most of the hybrid stars proposed up to now might be difficult to reach the observed maximum mass , which is about two solar mass @xcite . or , quark matter occupies very tiny region , even if the massive hybrid stars could be constructed .    along with the origin of magnetic field of neutron star ,",
    "the strength of magnetic field inside the star is also uncertain .",
    "the dipole magnetic field must dominate outside the star , while the magnetic configuration inside the star may be more complex due to the magnetic instability . according to the virial theorem , the maximum magnetic field for the neutron star with @xmath18 km and @xmath19 could be in the order of @xmath20 gauss @xcite . on the other hand , the maximum magnetic field in the quark phase might reach @xmath21 gauss , adopting the condition that the magnetic energy density should not exceed the energy density of the self - bound quark matter @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field inside the star would be so strong , one has to take into account the effect of magnetic field on the neutron star matter , where the quantum effects such as the landau levels may also play an important role to determine the stellar configuration .",
    "so far , there are a few literatures about the macroscopic structures of hybrid stars under the magnetic field @xcite . considering the effects of the magnetic field in hadronic and quark phases , we find two important differences .",
    "one is the population of the charged particles : neutrons dominate over charged particles in the hadronic phase , while all the quarks have net electric charge .",
    "the other one is the difference of the mass of particles : baryons have much larger mass than quarks .",
    "these two features suggest that the effect of the magnetic field should be more important in quark matter . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the landau level in the quark phase of hybrid star .",
    "we derive a critical magnetic field @xmath22 for given density , above which only the lowest landau level is occupied , and find the eos becomes stiffest as a causality limit for @xmath23 , independent of the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , we especially examine how massive the hybrid star can become with the effect of strong magnetic field .",
    "we demonstrate that the eos becomes _ stiff _ as a result of the hadron - quark phase transition in the strong magnetic field .",
    "then , we find that the hybrid star whose mass is more than two solar mass , can have a very large quark core , i.e. ,  _ hybrid quark star _ \" .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we adopt the geometric unit of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "assuming the uniform magnetic field along the @xmath27 axis , the @xmath28-th energy level of quark with flavor @xmath29 in the strongly magnetic field is given by @xmath30 } , \\label{eq : en}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath17 denote the particle mass , the plank constant , the magnetic field strength , and the degree of freedom of spin , respectively , while @xmath34 with the electron charge @xmath35 .",
    "as shown later , the lowest landau level ( lll ) plays a primary role in our discussion , where quark matter settles only in lll , the quark number density @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the fermi momentum of quark . since the typical values of the number density and magnetic field are @xmath39 with the saturation density @xmath40 @xmath2 and @xmath41 gauss in this paper , the fermi momentum of quark can be estimated as @xmath42 gev , which is much less than @xmath31 .",
    "then , the mass term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : en ] ) does not significantly contribute to the energy level , @xmath43 . in this case , the energy density of quark @xmath44 is @xmath45 and quark matter becomes flavor symmetric , i.e. , @xmath46 , which leads to @xmath47 .",
    "we remark that the baryon number density @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "then , the total energy density @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 within the mit bag model , where @xmath52 denotes the bag constant . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nb ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) , @xmath50 is @xmath53 while the pressure , @xmath54 , is calculated by @xmath55 as a result , one can express @xmath54 as a function of @xmath48 , such as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 gauss ) .",
    "although the pressure expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) depends on @xmath33 as well as the baryon number density , we can find that the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath50 becomes that @xmath59 , which is independently of the magnetic field strength . from this relationship",
    ", the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath60 , becomes equivalent to the speed of light @xmath25 .",
    "thus , this is corresponding to the limiting case of a stiff eos , because @xmath61 can not exceed @xmath25 to keep the causality . note that the eos of free quark matter gives @xmath62 .",
    "we also remark that our eos would reduce to the same as the eos of free quark matter in the limit of low magnetic field , where quarks occupy all the landau levels .",
    "the condition that quark matter can settle only in lll is that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the fermi energy of quark . with the relation of @xmath65 in lll",
    ", one can derive the critical strength of the magnetic field so that quarks only occupy lll for each flavor .",
    "we then find that the critical strength for @xmath15 quarks is weaker than that for @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , due to the difference of electric charge @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the condition for all quarks only occupy lll is given by that the magnetic field should be stronger than the critical strength for @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , i.e. , one can show that the magnetic field strength should be larger than the critical strength @xmath22 given by @xmath67{6\\pi^4}\\hbar c}{e}n_{\\rm b}^{2/3 } \\nonumber \\\\             & = & 1.62\\times 10^{19 } \\times\\left(\\frac{n_{\\rm b}}{n_0}\\right)^{2/3 } \\",
    "\\rm{gauss}.     \\label{eq : bc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it may be interesting to see that this critical strength is not changed even in the non - relativistic limit . thus the critical strength can be drawn as a universal function of density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lll ] ) .",
    "if the magnetic field exceeds @xmath22 at some density region in quark matter , eos is given by the causal limit there .",
    "note that eos becomes invariant for the increase of the magnetic field once @xmath23 holds .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "some compact objects have a strong magnetic field , although the details of the distribution of magnetic field inside the stars are still uncertain .",
    "maybe , one should consider the effects of such strong magnetic field on the structure of compact objects .",
    "we particularly focus on the hybrid stars in this paper , i.e. , the core region of neutron stars is composed of quark matter .",
    "we estimate that the critical magnetic field strength above which quarks only occupy lll ( and the second landau level ) , which is shown that @xmath68 gauss .",
    "we also find that the equation of state ( eos ) in the phase of lll can be expressed as @xmath69 independently of the magnetic field strength , where @xmath52 denotes the bag constant .",
    "we remark that this is the limit of a stiff eos , i.e. , the sound speed becomes equal to the speed of light .",
    "we derive these results by using the mit bag model , where quarks move almost freely , so that our findings should be relevant especially in the core region due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , while there may be added non - perturbative effects in the moderate density region",
    ". further consideration on the eos of quark matter based on qcd is a future subject .    on the other hand , in general",
    ", the maximum mass of hybrid star comes to be smaller than the observed maximum mass , i.e. , @xmath70 , because the introduction of quark matter makes the eos soft .",
    "even if one can construct the massive hybrid star , the quark region is generally quite tiny .",
    "however , owing to the effect of the landau levels in the quark phase , we are successful to construct the massive hybrid quark stars occupied in large part by quark matter , which can be larger than @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , in order to examine the qualitative behavior of hybrid stellar models , we simply consider three different connections of quark matter with the hadronic matter . as a result , we find that the stellar model constructed with eos connected to the hadronic matter at the lower energy density can realize more massive stellar model with smaller central energy density . in this paper",
    ", we consider simple stellar models as a first step , where we neglect the magnetic pressure and the deformation of stellar shape .",
    "such additional effects will be taken into account elsewhere .",
    "in addition , one might also have to consider the hadron - quark mixed phase in the more realistic stellar models @xcite . at any rate",
    ", one could see the properties of such phase modified by the strong magnetic field via the observations of the stellar oscillations @xcite , which tells us an additional information about the strongly magnetized compact objects .",

    "that is , an axisymmetric , poloidal magnetic field produced by a four - current @xmath71 is considered , where the electromagnetic four - potential becomes very simple such as @xmath72 . from the maxwell equations",
    "@xmath73 with the expansions of @xmath74 and @xmath75 as @xmath76 one can obtain the elliptic equation describing the @xmath77-th order potential @xmath78 ; @xmath79 where a prime and @xmath80 denote the partial derivative with respect to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , while @xmath83 is the @xmath77-th order legendre polynomial . for a dipole magnetic field ,",

    "the potential inside the neutron star , @xmath90 , is obtained by numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : da1 ] ) in such a way that @xmath90 should be connected to @xmath85 at the stellar surface , where the current distribution is determined by the integration condition , i.e. , @xmath91 @xcite . at last",

    "after the calculations of the dipole magnetic distribution for the stellar model constructed with the landau - a , -b , and -c eoss , we find that the magnetic field strength at the stellar center is proportional to the strength at the stellar surface as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the magnetic field strength at the stellar surface of the poles ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) , while @xmath102 is a proportionality factor .",

    "that is , the central strength of magnetic field can not reach to the critical magnetic field strength to realize the landau effects in quark matter phase even for magnetar with @xmath104 gauss , if the magnetic field configuration inside the star would be simply dipole ."
