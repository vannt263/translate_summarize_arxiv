    "recently the seesaw mechanism for the mixing of two virtual vacuum - levels due to fluctuations described by thin domain walls , has been explored in order to derive the natural scale of cosmological constant @xcite in terms of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale @xmath6 and planck mass defined by the newton constant @xmath7 in gravitation , @xmath8 , so that the vacuum state of de sitter spacetime ( ds ) constitutes the stationary level composed by the superposition of flat and anti - de sitter ( ads ) vacua , and it has got the constant energy density @xmath9 at @xmath3 @xcite . then , the modern value of cosmological constant @xcite gives @xmath10 ev , hence , @xmath11 gev , i.e. the low scale of susy breaking down .",
    "the virtual flat vacuum corresponds to a scalar field positioned in the local minimum of its potential with zero energy provided by the exact susy .",
    "the virtual ads vacuum - state is described by the field positioned at the local minimum of primary potential with positive energy , which breaks down susy , while the supergravity contribution linear in @xmath7 @xcite gives the term providing the negative overall sign of cosmological constant due to the dominant energy density of zero - point quantum - field modes with masses @xmath12",
    ". the virtual flat vacuum does not decay to the ads one due to stabilization effect of gravity @xcite , but it suffers from fluctuations in the form of spherically symmetric ads - bubbles surrounded by domain walls .",
    "then , due to such the specific seesaw mechanism , one of two true stationary states is the ds - vacuum .",
    "note , that the low energy contributions due to such phenomena like the electroweak symmetry breaking down or condensates in qcd can modify the vacuum energy of initial ads - state with broken susy , only , while zero energy of flat state is preserved by exact susy .",
    "however , the numerical value of low energy condensates is negligible in comparison with the dominant term coming from the susy breaking itself due to the appropriate hierarchy of relevant scales .",
    "similarly , any dynamics at energies higher than the scale of susy breaking down can not disturb the vacuum energy , since such the dynamics is supersymmetric .",
    "the quite general idea of incorporating the seesaw mechanism for the derivation of naturally small cosmological constant from the planck mass and susy breaking scale is not originally new itself .",
    "such the point of view was presented in scientific e - folklore as discussion in blogs , for instance .",
    "in addition , in the framework of supergravity g.  chalmers argued for the relevant suppression of cosmological constant in @xcite .",
    "however , the idea becomes more actual , when it is realized in terms of reasonable model .",
    "m.  mcguigan has modified the wheeler - dewitt equation in order to switch on a coupling between two sectors characterized by the planck scale and susy , correspondingly .",
    "so , the seesaw mechanism has been involved into the gravity , and the cosmological constant of natural scale has been generated @xcite .",
    "the other way has been formulated in our approach invented in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have constructed a model of potential , which has allowed us to investigate the scale parameters in the problem within the suggested approach .",
    "so , we have established the following general features :    * thin domain walls correspond to the low - scale susy breaking down due to the gauge mediation , when the distance between the extremal positions of scalar field takes sub - planckian values , while * thick domain walls are related with the gravity - mediated susy breaking down at high energies @xmath13 gev and super - planckian values of field increment between the extremals .",
    "this potential is suitable also for demonstrating the origin of fermion generations observed in the standard model .",
    "indeed , the non - trivial vacuum structure is described by a superposition of initial states with definite masses of fermions .",
    "the superposition can be represented by two - dimensional ( 2d ) column , say .",
    "therefore , it is natural that a @xmath14 mass - matrix is involved for the fermion states , i.e. two generations appear .",
    "one can easily introduce three generations by considering the superposition of three initial vacuum - states : two flat levels and single ads - vacuum in the model discussed .",
    "however , such the vacuum structure does not answer the question , why we are living in the vacuum we have got , since all of three stationary superpositions can be occupied , but one of them , at least , is the ads - state with a huge negative energy density irrelevant to the astronomical observations .",
    "moreover , it is the flat vacuum suffering from the domain - wall fluctuations",
    ". therefore , evolving the scalar field to the position of flat vacuum will incorporate the mixing with the ads - vacuum only , and the evolution will not see the mixing with another flat vacuum even through the ads - states , since beyond the domain wall the boundary condition at spatial infinity remains unchanged , i.e. ascribed to the first flat vacuum .",
    "this fact does not influence the analysis as concerns for scaling properties of potential , of course .",
    "however , the potential needs a modification compatible with the scalar - field evolution during the universe expansion in order to get the natural reason for the living in the ds - vacuum .",
    "in addition , the potential of @xcite suggests a kind of fine tuning , because of its two flat vacua with the coinciding zero vacuum - energy at different values of scalar field .",
    "the direction of modification is clear : one should get a potential with a single flat vacuum and a couple of ads - vacua , which energy densities @xmath15 do not coincide , in general , but @xmath16 take values of the same order of magnitude . then , the flat vacuum will fluctuate due to bubbles of both ads - vacua , and the universe will get the observed cosmological constant in the ds - state , if the evolution will drive it to the field - position in the flat vacuum .",
    "in section [ s - ii ] we present the model of potential satisfying all requirements listed above .",
    "the potential is composed of several contributions .",
    "the first term is the bare quadratic potential , which generates the second contribution being the quartic term due to the supergravity correction linear in newton constant @xmath7 .",
    "the third term modifies the potential at low energies due to the modelled contribution by zero - point modes , so that it has got the form with the flat local minimum and two ads minima .",
    "the barrier between the flat and ads minima is tuned in order to produce the thin domain wall with the thickness given by the inverse bare mass in the first term mentioned above . moreover ,",
    "the behavior of potential at @xmath17 is well approximated by the quartic term with the coupling constant of the same order of magnitude at large fields .",
    "then , we can evaluate the bare mass @xmath18 gev and quartic coupling @xmath19 .    the vacuum structure formed due to the mixing between the initial flat and ads",
    "vacua because of domain wall fluctuations , is described in section [ s - iii ] .",
    "then , the stationary ds - vacuum state appears due to the fluctuations in vicinity of flat vacuum .    in section [ s - iv ]",
    "we study the inflation @xcite governed by the scalar field with the quadric and quartic self - couplings .",
    "the field evolution corresponds to the dynamical system possessing the properties of parametric attractor : the kinetic and potential terms rapidly reach stable critical points , which have got a slow driftage with the growth of e - folding in the scale factor of accelerated expansion .",
    "then , the quasi - attractor provides us with the tool to quantify the inhomogeneity generated by the quantum fluctuations of scalar field during the inflation .",
    "the data signalize for the dominance of quadratic term in the potential .",
    "we give a numerical constraint for the dominance and discuss the conditions of its realization in consistency with the observations .",
    "after the inflation , the scalar field enters the stage of preheating due to the tachyonic mechanism : the potential barrier generates a negative square of effective mass , that results in the scalar field decay to massless quanta in vicinity of flat vacuum .",
    "the preheating should take place at the temperature @xmath20 gev determined by the barrier height .",
    "thus , the universe evolution drives to the ds - vacuum state .",
    "note that the review on the relation of inflation to the particle physics and on the mechanism of preheating and thermalization of universe after the inflation can be found in @xcite .",
    "section [ s - v ] is devoted to the analysis of textures in the mass matrices for three generations of charged fermions as caused by the vacuum structure .",
    "we show that the hierarchies in masses and mixings of charged weak currents as well as a fine violation of combined inversion of charge and space can be natural for the fermions of observable sector , while the hidden sector responsible for the susy breaking down can remain heavy .",
    "the picture similar to the hidden sector could take place for the sfermion partners of observable fermions .    in section [ s - vi",
    "] we summarize our results and discuss problems of the model offered .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we ascribe the energy density of initial vacuum - state @xmath21 to the effective contribution of single fermionic zero - point quantum - field mode @xmath22      = & \\displaystyle\\frac{2}{(16\\pi)^2}\\;m^4\\,(\\sinh      4y-4y)\\big|_{y(\\mathscr{m})}^{y(\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{x } } } ) } \\end{array}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] . at @xmath25 ,",
    "susy is exact , while at @xmath26 we get @xmath27 and susy is broken down . here , @xmath28 is actually expressed in terms of canonic scalar field @xmath29 representing the component of chiral superfield .",
    "below we put @xmath29 to be real .",
    "this constraint is introduced by two following requirements :    i ) : :    phenomenologically , the inflation is well described by a single real    scalar field called `` the inflaton '' , which is ascribed to the real    component of scalar field in the chiral superfield in the framework of    our model .",
    "ii ) : :    during the inflation , the supersymmtery is suggested broken down , so    that the imaginary part of scalar component of chiral superfield    acquires a mass of planckian scale , that makes its dynamics irrelevant    ( or simply frozen ) at the inflationary stage under study . in that    case , the shift symmetry of superpotential becomes invalid , and it    remains beyond the scope of problem in touch .",
    "the complete actual potential energy including linear corrections in @xmath7 from supergravity , has the form @xmath30          & \\displaystyle          + \\frac{16\\pi}{3}\\,g\\,\\phi^2\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial      f}{\\partial\\phi}\\right)^2 ,      \\end{array}\\ ] ] which involves the scalar - field potential without supergravity @xmath31 in terms of superpotential @xmath32 .    putting the bare superpotential equal to @xmath33 we get the quadric bare potential @xmath34 while the complete bare potential gains the quartic term in accordance with ( [ mg2 ] ) , @xmath35 where @xmath36 therefore , to the linear order in @xmath7 , the supergravity modifies the quadric bare potential by the quartic term with the constant @xmath37 sure , the bare values run in accordance with both the renormalization group and redefinitions in the effective action .",
    "thus , they can depend on the field value at low energies , at least , i.e. when @xmath29 is close to zero .",
    "we accept the nonperturbative or low - energy term of superpotential by setting @xmath38    consider the ansatz @xmath39\\right\\}\\right)^\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 introduces the mass parameter , while @xmath41 is a polynomial function , describing corrections to the quadratic dependence of the exponent argument versus the filed .",
    "then , at @xmath17 we get @xmath42 , and the vacuum density of energy nullifies , so that at @xmath43 the superpotential behaves like @xmath44 and @xmath45 which gives the low - energy correction to the bare quartic potential @xmath46 with @xmath47 setting @xmath48 we find @xmath49    we consider the situation with thin domain walls corresponding to the gauge - mediated breaking down susy .",
    "it suggests that the correction function @xmath41 could look as the expansion in inverse @xmath50 determined by a strong - field interaction in the gauge sector , so that to the leading order one could expect @xmath51 hence , at @xmath52 we arrive to @xmath53 , which gives @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we suppose that the actual superpotential is well approximated by its low - energy term at @xmath56 , while at @xmath57 the superpotential tends to the bare form .",
    "it means the followings :    * the first condition in ( [ bare6 ] ) should naturally take place . *",
    "the bare mass in the quadratic term of potential is substituted by its running value @xmath58 , which tends to zero at @xmath56 , so that , at least , @xmath59 equivalent to , if one puts the cut off about @xmath6 .",
    "such the mass will run to the bare value , when the cut off tends to the planck scale . ] @xmath60 that means @xmath61 .",
    "then , the actual potential @xmath62 acquires a positively - valued extremum at @xmath63 , that means the breaking down susy , while @xmath64 takes a negative value at the extremum , that guarantees its ads - position .",
    "the domain - wall thickness is of the order of @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the field increment between the fields corresponding to the flat and ads - states , i.e. @xmath67 , hence , @xmath68 the second condition of ( [ bare7 ] ) gives @xmath69 that means that the thickness of domain wall is fixed by the bare mass of scalar field in the theory .",

    "some other approaches to the cosmological constant problem in the framework of seesaw mechanism can be found in @xcite .",
    "the standard scenario of inflation with the single scalar field @xmath29 possessing the quadratic and quartic self - couplings suggests that the inflaton takes values about the planck scale .",
    "as we have mentioned above , at such the field values the running mass can be close to its bare value , that leads to approximate equality of quadratic and quartic terms of potential .",
    "then , we get well elaborated picture of inflation consistent with observed features of matter inhomogeneity in the universe : the magnitude of fluctuations of matter density , spectral index of scalar fluctuations and fraction of tensor perturbations , if one takes the couplings in agreement with ( [ num - cond ] ) . thus , the parameters of inflaton potential are inherently related with the scale of susy breaking down .",
    "however , a numerical analysis should be performed with more caution , since the relation between the scales in ( [ bare4 ] ) due to the simplest connection of bare quadric potential with the quartic coupling suggests a too steep growth of quartic term , which starts to dominate during the inflation .",

    "therefore , we conclude that realistic scenario suggests @xmath184 , i.e. @xmath185 , which results in @xmath186 due to ( [ inf18 ] ) . from the relation between the bare values in ( [ bare4 ] ) , we get @xmath187 which is inconsistent with the referable dominance of quadratic term . however , we have to take into account the running of potential parameters mentioned above . in this respect",
    "one could put the quartic constant approximately equal to its bare value , since this value is extremely small , so that one could expect no significant renormalization of the constant even at large logarithmic increment of scale . in contrast",
    ", one can put @xmath188 at @xmath189 .",
    "then , @xmath190 and the quadratic term dominates , if @xmath191 or @xmath192 , hence , the actual mass of inflaton should be about @xmath193 gev in agreement with the phenomenological analysis of observed data .",
    "such the situation is not in any contradiction with quite general properties of the potential , as concerns its scales , since factors of the form @xmath194 could be responsible for the finite rescaling used above .",
    "thus , the dominance of quadratic term can be actual .",
    "one could simply require ( [ res4 ] ) from the form of potential at @xmath195 by setting @xmath196 , of course .",
    "however , the estimate of ( [ rere ] ) can be derived from the analysis presented above , only .",
    "another aspect of inflation is related with the potential behavior in vicinity of @xmath81 .",
    "first , the ads minimum is not essential for the inflation , since its scale of energy density @xmath197 is essentially less than the energy density to the end of inflation @xmath198 , i.e. there is the hierarchy @xmath199 .",
    "second , the potential barrier between the flat and ads vacua has the height about @xmath200 therefore , the local peak of potential is also inessential for the inflation , too .",
    "however , both these items can be involved into the mechanism of reheating .    in this respect ,",
    "the most essential effect is related with the potential barrier , since near the peak the effective inflaton - mass squared is negative , that causes the tachyonic instability resulting in the preheating mechanism : a rapid decay of the inflaton to quanta at the moment , when the energy density becomes comparable with the peak height @xcite . then , we can evaluate the preheating temperature @xmath201 by @xmath202 where @xmath203 is an effective mass of quanta .",
    "numerically , ( [ rere2 ] ) gives @xmath204 in the model under consideration , the inflaton quanta with respect to the flat vacuum possess the effective mass equal to zero , @xmath205 while the quanta with respect to the ads vacuum have nonzero mass , that can be roughly evaluated by @xmath206 though the mass can have got a much less value .",
    "nevertheless , the decay to massless quanta would be kinematically preferable , that leads to _ the relaxation of inflaton in vicinity of flat vacuum _ , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fall ] .",
    "thus , the scalar field could inflationary evolve and relax in the flat vacuum after the tachyonic preheating in agreement with current experimental constraints from the observational data .",
    "such the evolution could explain why we are living in the vacuum we have got .",
    "a discussion of some other aspects of inflation in supergravity can be found in review @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mechanism with an effectively real inflaton was considered by kawasaki , yamaguchi and yanagidain in @xcite , while the mechanism for the vacuum stabilization was offered by kachru , kallosh , linde and trevedi in @xcite .",
    "further developments include also the problem of irreversible vacuum decays that serve as sinks for the probability flow @xcite .",
    "the vacuum structure considered in section [ s - iii ] suggests that quantum field vibrations in vicinity of initial vacuum - states can mix . we can easily investigate the main features of such the mixing in the simplest case of potential symmetry versus @xmath78 .",
    "then , the mass matrix for fermions takes the form @xmath207 where @xmath208 stands for the fermion mass in the ads - vacua , when susy is broken down , while @xmath209 denotes the fermion mass in the flat supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "elements @xmath210 introduce the mixing . in ( [ gen1 ] )",
    "all of elements except @xmath211 are real due to the freedom in the definition of complex phases for the initial states , while @xmath212 because of symmetry .",
    "let us introduce the complex phase @xmath213 by setting @xmath214 transforming the matrix to @xmath215 with @xmath216 at @xmath217 we get @xmath218    \\mathrm{i}\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{a}}}\\sin\\gamma\\ ,    \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\gamma } &    m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{x}}}+\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{a}}}\\cos\\gamma &    \\sqrt{2 } \\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{b } } } \\\\[2 mm ]    0 & \\sqrt{2}\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{b } } } & m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{s } } } \\\\",

    "indeed , its eigenvalues are given by @xmath230        m_3= & m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{x}}}+        \\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{a } } } ,      \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath231 . setting @xmath232 at @xmath233 and @xmath234 , we obtain @xmath235        m_1\\approx & \\displaystyle        -\\frac{2\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{b}}}^2 }        { \\widetilde\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{a}}}+m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{s}}}}.      \\end{array}\\ ] ] therefore , conditions @xmath236 lead to the hierarchy of fermion masses @xmath237 two lighter generations are formed by superposition of two initial states defining matrix ( [ gen6 ] ) .",
    "the superposition is simply the rotation with angle @xmath238 @xmath239 which is the analogue of cabibbo angle , since the electroweak partners of fermion fields could have got the mass matrix with the same texture , that leads to the similar mixing of initial states , so that initially diagonal electorweak charge currents acquire the mixing of two lighter generations with the angle given by the difference of @xmath240 parameters for two kinds of fields .",
    "thus , the realistic scenario suggests the texture with @xmath241      |m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{x}}}-\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{a}}}|&\\gg &      \\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{b}}},\\\\[2 mm ]      \\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{b}}}^2&\\gg &      |m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{s}}}-\\mu_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{a}}}|\\ ,      m_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\textsc{s}}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] such the hierarchy can be natural , since parameters @xmath208 and @xmath225 are determined by the vacuum state with susy broken down at the scale @xmath6 , while @xmath209 could be equal to zero in the case of exact susy .",
    "then , the only condition required is a small mixing between the ordinary fermionic fields in the sectors with broken and exact susy , that could serve as the definition of _ ordinary _ matter fields in contrast to the _ hidden _ sector , wherein one could expect @xmath242 , which breaks the hierarchy down , and it leads to hidden fermions with masses of the order of @xmath6 .    at the limit of @xmath243",
    ", one can expect the observation of almost massless generation of ordinary fermions with respect to the scale of susy breaking , of course .",
    "this fact is in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the correction to the symmetric case produces a small mixing of heavy generation of ordinary matter with two lighter generations as well as the violation of @xmath244-invariance due to ( [ gen7 ] ) .",
    "this correction can be treated perturbatively , if appropriate matrix elements of @xmath245 is much less than the splitting between the levels , i.e. at @xmath246 , that simply gives @xmath247 .",
    "similar features of generation structure can be exported to the sector of fermion superpartners , i.e. scalar fields of sfermions . then ,",
    "in the action quadratic versus the sfermions , the mass matrix is composed by both squares of initial masses positioned at the diagonal and non - diagonal mixing parameters .",
    "since the eigenvalues could turn out to be negative , the negative sign would indicate the generation of sfermion condensates .",
    "anyway , the observational situation suggests that sfermions have no light states analogous to the almost massless generation .",
    "therefore , sfermions should imitate the texture of hidden sector .",
    "the question about gauge vector fields is more specific , since such the fields acquire masses due to the higgs effect .",
    "we can suppose that the observed mediators of gauge interactions couple to the lightest generation of higgs field , while two more heavy hidden generations of higgs scalars as well as , probably , gauge fields can be discovered at the energy scale of susy breaking down .",
    "in the present paper we have offered the ansatz for the low energy modification of bare quadratic potential for the phenomenological real scalar field , so that the correction parameterizes the energy density given by zero - point modes of quantum fields due to the supergravity relation between the superpotential and energy density linear in the newton constant @xmath7 .",
    "so , the low energy superpotential generates three local minima : one minimum corresponds to superysmmetric flat vacuum - state , while two other minima give the susy breaking down .",
    "to the same order in @xmath7 , the bare superpotential induces the bare quartic term of potential , so that the actual potential taking into account all of bare and low energy terms has the characteristic form with the barrier separating the flat vacuum from two ads - states .",
    "these initial vacuum - states are not stationary , since the bubbles of ads - vacua in the flat vacuum generate the fluctuations inducing the mixing . putting the domain wall thickness equal to the inverse bare mass by the order of magnitude and the low energy quartic coupling equal to the bare value",
    ", we have determined the bare mass scale @xmath248 gev and quartic coupling @xmath249 .",
    "having took into account the mixing described phenomenologically , we have found the stationary vacua represented by superpositions of initial flat and ads - states .",
    "so , we have got two ads - states with vacuum energy scale about the scale of susy breaking down , while the single ds - state acquires the cosmological constant consistent with the experimental data .",
    "then , statically the offered potential naturally gives the vacuum with the desired small value of cosmological constant determined via the seesaw mechanism of mixing in terms of tuned potential barrier .",
    "further , we have shown , that the same scalar field can serve as the inflaton .",
    "the observations prefer for the quadratic term dominance in the region of planckian fields .",
    "this constraint has been analyzed by means of quasi - attractor approach .",
    "then , the inhomogeneity of matter in the universe is in agreement with the quantum fluctuations of field during the inflation .",
    "the inflaton decays into massless quanta in vicinity of potential barrier , the height of which determines the temperature of preheating .",
    "this decay can take place on the background of flat vacuum , only .",
    "then , the domain wall fluctuations transform the flat vacuum into the stationary ds - state , while the stationary ads - states remain beyond the play .",
    "the vacuum structure causes three fermion generations .",
    "we have analyzed the textures of mass matrices .",
    "so , the hierarchies for masses and mixing of the ordinary matter in the observable sector can be consistently constructed , or otherwise heavy states in the hidden sector and in the sector of superpartners for the ordinary fields can be introduced .",
    "thus , the offered model of potential is suitable for the description of three benchmarks : the naturally small cosmological constant , inflation with further preheating stage driving to the ds - state , and three fermion generations with appropriate hierarchies and mixing .    in this scheme",
    "all of susy breaking effects as well as consequent low energy condensates and phase transitions are accumulated in the energy density of initial ads - vacua , while the flat vacuum is preserved from its influence due to the exact susy .",
    "the mixing of flat and ads - states is described phenomenologically in terms of real scalar field .",
    "we have argued for the dynamical evolution to the ds - vacuum .",
    "so , we have presented the natural mechanism of driving to the observed cosmological constant , that is alternative to the renormmalization group arguments developed in @xcite .",

    "<S> the fluctuations are responsible for the vacuum with the cosmological constant at the scale of @xmath1 ev suppressed by the planckian mass @xmath2 via @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate vacuum state is occupied after the inflation with quartic coupling constant @xmath4 inherently related with the bare mass scale of determining the thickness of domain walls @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> such the parameters of potential are still marginally consistent with the observed inhomogeneity of matter density in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary evolution suggests the vacuum structure compatible with three fermionic generations of matter as well as with observed hierarchies of masses and mixing in the standard model . </S>"
