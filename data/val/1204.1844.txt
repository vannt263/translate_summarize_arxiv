    "one of the advantageous in this manner is a possibility of the ultrafast control of magnetism , since motion of electronic charge is much faster than pure spin motion which is usually governed by the exchange interaction .",

    "<S> photoirradiation effects in correlated electrons coupled with localized spins are studied based on the extended double - exchange model . in particular , we examine melting of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) charge order insulating state by varying the light intensity . when intense light is irradiated , the afm insulating characteristics are strengthened , rather than change into the ferromagnetic metallic characteristic , which are expected from the conventional double exchange interaction when carriers are introduced by weak light irradiation or chemical doping . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a new principle for optically manipulating magnetism . </S>"
