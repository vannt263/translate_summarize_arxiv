    "scalar fields play an enormous role in studies of gravity , understanding dynamics of the universe and the physical nature of its dark sector .",
    "first , various unified models of field theories predict the existence of scalar partners to the tensor gravity of general relativity .",
    "the simplest generalizations of the einstein s theory of gravity , in which in addition to the metric the gravitation interaction is mediated by a scalar field , are those of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "second , recent observational evidence @xcite-@xcite indicates that the universe is presently dominated by a component dubbed dark energy .",
    "one of the approaches to account dark energy is to introduce the cosmological constant in the framework of general relativity .",
    "however a huge and still unexplained fine - tuning of the cosmological constant value @xcite has not been understood yet .",
    "another widespread interpretation of dark energy is that of quintessence , which is described by a scalar field minimally coupled to einstein gravity rolling down some self - interaction potential @xcite . to take into account the region where the equation of state is less than @xmath2 , the model with a phantom scalar field ( i.e. with a negative kinetic energy ) , an extension of the quintessence model ,",
    "was suggested in @xcite .",
    "a variety of works in scalar - tensor gravity are devoted to a search of an alternate explanation of dark energy @xcite .",
    "an additional interest in scalar - tensor theories arises from various inflationary scenarios of the early universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently gravitational models with the higgs - potential attached much attention @xcite-@xcite .    in papers @xcite the awe hypothesis within the framework of the generalized brans - dicke theory with a non - universal coupling was proposed .",
    "the original motivation for studying this type of models is related to a unified description of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) based on a relaxation of the weak equivalence principle on large - scales @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the model contains three different sectors : gravitation , described by the metric and the fundamental brans - dicke field , the visible matter ( baryons , photons , etc . ) and the invisible sector , constituted by an abnormally weighting energy ( awe ) .",
    "the awe hypothesis assumes that the invisible sector experiences the background spacetime with a different gravitational strength than the ordinary matter , which is formulated in terms of the non - universality of the couplings to gravity for the visible and invisible sectors . the idea of a violation of the equivalence principle for the particular case of dm appeared prior to the numerous evidence for cosmic acceleration and the advent of de .",
    "several models based on microphysics have been considered to achieve such a mass - variation for dm in particular @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as it is known one can describe the matter content with either the fluid or scalar field approaches . in @xcite the cosmological evolution was studied in a flat flrw background using a fluid description for the matter and the awe sectors .",
    "it is shown that the late - time accelerated expansion may take place in the jordan frame as well as there is an opportunity for building an inflation mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we continue our investigations of the awe model and aim to obtain explicit solutions . as distinct from previous works @xcite assuming exponential couplings ( mutually inverse ) to gravity",
    ", we describe the matter and the invisible sector by scalar fields , which can be both ordinary or phantom ones .",
    "the complexity having scalar fields makes difficulties for finding exact solutions .",
    "nevertheless , in the einstein frame it can be shown that under the cosmological ansatz for required solutions the gravitational equations are trivial and scalar fields equations correspond to geodesic equations on the target space of a nonlinear sigma - model @xcite .",
    "we show that using the sigma - model approach yields an effective one - component lagrangian with a potential . the model with reciprocal exponential coupling functions can be can be turned to a higgs - like one .",
    "scalar models with higgs - potentials inspired by string field theories have been studied recently in @xcite .",
    "we also present exact solutions in elliptic functions for this case of the coupling functions . in gravity theories cosmological solutions in elliptic functions",
    "have been appeared in works @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the model of the generalized tensor - scalar gravity both in the jordan and the einstein frames . in sect .",
    "3 assuming the flat flrw background we solve the einstein equations and show that the scalar field equations are equivalent to the equations of motions for a sigma - model .",
    "we also present solutions in quadratures for scalar fields with arbitrary coupling functions . in sect .",
    "4 we fix the coupling functions as reciprocal exponents and derive for various sets of parameters . in sect.5 using numerical computations we study the behavior of the scale factor in the jordan frame for certain parameters and obtain its analytical approximation in exponential functions .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec.6 .",
    "we start by considering the action in the jordan frame of the generalized brans - dicke theory introduced in @xcite @xmath3 +   \\nonumber\\\\ \\varepsilon_{2}s_{a}[\\psi_{a } , m^{2}(\\phi)\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the `` bare '' gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the jordan - frame metric coupling universally to the ordinary matter , @xmath6 is the determinant of the metric @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the scalar curvature build upon @xmath7 , @xmath9 is a scalar degree - of - freedom , @xmath10 is the brans - dicke coupling function while @xmath11 are the fundamental fields entering the physical description of the matter and abnormally weighting sectors , respectively , @xmath12 denotes the sign of the kinetic term for the scalar fields : @xmath13 corresponds to a usual scalar field with positive kinetic energy and @xmath14 to a phantom field , @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that the matter action @xmath16 does not explicitly depend on the scalar field @xmath9 , so the local laws of physics are those of special relativity .",
    "the presence of the non - minimal coupling @xmath17 in the sector @xmath18 represents a mass - variation . to find solutions for the model ( [ 1.1 ] ) looks to be complicated due to the admixture of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom",
    "consequently , it is convenient to rewrite the action in the so - called einstein frame where the tensorial @xmath7 and scalar @xmath9 degrees of freedom separate into a metric @xmath19 and a scalar field @xmath20 .",
    "the jordan and the einstein frames are related by the conformal transformation @xmath21 with the scalar field redefinition @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the non - minimal coupling functions .",
    "doing so , the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) in the einstein frame takes the form @xmath24 - 2g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi\\partial_{\\nu}\\varphi\\bigr\\ }   - \\int d^{4 } x \\sqrt{-g}\\varepsilon_{1}a^{2}_{m}(\\varphi)g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi_{m}\\partial_{\\nu}\\psi_{m } - \\\\",

    "the action is similar to those of chameleon scalar fields @xcite ( without the self - interaction potential ) .",
    "the einstein equations for the action ( [ 1.4 ] ) read as follows @xmath27.\\ ] ] the stress - energy tensors for the ordinary and abnormally weighting sectors read @xmath28 the field equation for @xmath20 can be written the following form @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor of the sector @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the scalar coupling strengths to the ordinary and abnormally weighting matter , respectively .",
    "the field equations for the scalar fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 read @xmath36",
    "here we consider a flat friedman - lematre - robertson - walker spacetime as a background @xmath37 owing to the presence of the coupling functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , obtaining solutions for the model ( [ 1.4 ] ) ( especially solutions to the scalar field equations ) seems difficult .",
    "however , under the assumption that the metric is given by ( [ 2.4 ] ) and that the scalar fields depend on only a single ( time ) coordinate , the einstein equations ( [ 1.5 ] ) become trivial and the scalar field equations ( [ 1.9])-([1.10 ] ) reduce to the equations of motion for a geodesic curve for the @xmath40-component nonlinear @xmath41-model . to show this we rewrite the lagrangian corresponding to the action ( [ 1.4 ] ) . representing the set of the scalar fields as a sigma - model source term one obtains @xmath42 - 2h_{ab}\\acute{\\sigma}^{a}\\acute{\\sigma}^{b},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the multiplet @xmath44 and the matrix @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 reads @xmath47 here a @xmath48 denotes differentiation with respect to time variable @xmath49 . it should be noted that the above model appeared in association with spontaneous compactification of the extra dimensions in higher - dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "owing to the homogeneity and isotropy of the flwr - background , we have only two einstein equations ( [ 1.5 ] ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hubble parameter @xmath52 . one can immediately integrate the equations ( [ 2.5])-([2.6 ] ) and write the result as follows @xmath53^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants of integration .    using the time variable @xmath57 @xcite , the equations of motion for the scalar fields ( [ 1.7 ] ) , ( [ 1.9 ] ) , ( [ 1.10 ] ) can be decoupled from the gravitational part and take the form @xmath58 here and in what follows @xmath59 .",
    "now it is clear that equations ( [ 2.9a ] ) are the lagrange equations corresponding to the following lagrangian @xmath60 with the energy integral of motion @xmath61 for the nonlinear sigma - model with the metric ( [ 2.3 ] ) and coordinates @xmath62 , @xmath63 , ( [ 2.2 ] ) on the target space @xmath64 . for the constant @xmath65",
    "the reduction to the sigma model was proved ( for a more general setup ) in @xcite .",
    "the case of diagonal @xmath66 with arbitrary dependence on scalar fields in @xmath67 dimensions , @xmath68 , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath43 , @xmath69 , are cyclic and the corresponding equations of motion read @xmath70 or in a more detailed form @xmath71    eqs .",
    "( [ 2.9 ] ) give rise the constants of motion @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants of integration , which are usually interpreted as scalar charges .    using ( [ 2.12 ] ) the lagrangian ( [ 2.13 ] ) can be represented in the following form @xmath75 where the potential is given by @xmath76 the energy integral of motion ( [ 2.14 ] ) now looks like @xmath77 and yields the following quadrature @xmath78 which defines the solutions for the scalar field @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we come to the effective one - component model with a massive scalar field . in the case of arbitrary coupling functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the exact solutions for @xmath20 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are given by quadratures ( [ 2.19 ] ) and @xmath79 the detailed solutions for the model ( [ 1.4 ] ) , and hence its dynamics , depend on the exact solution for the scalar field @xmath20 which is defined by the particular form of the potential @xmath80 in an analogous way to the constitutive coupling function @xmath81 in @xcite .    *",
    "one - loop corrections and the sigma - model .",
    "*    let us now specify the coupling functions @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the coupling strength constant to the gravitational scalar @xmath20 .",
    "the lagrangian of the scalar sigma - model ( [ 2.13 ] ) has the following form @xmath84 where @xmath83 , @xmath85 are couplings related by @xmath86 .    for ( [ 4.1 ] ) one can estimate the influence of the quantum corrections on the hierarchy between the coupling strengths .",
    "the full analysis requires considering perturbations produced by both metric and scalar field parts ( see , for example , @xcite ) and will be given in our forthcoming paper @xcite . here , for simplicity , we confine ourselves to the discussion of perturbative expansions of the sigma - model fields following the geometric background field method based on @xcite . in order take into account quantum corrections",
    ", counterterms should be build from products of the riemann tensor @xmath87 including contractions of it such as the ricci tensor @xmath88 and the scalar curvature @xmath89 .",
    "thus , at first loop , one obtains the following redefenition of the sigma - model metric @xmath90 using the relations for @xmath88 and @xmath89 from ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) , we can conclude that for the exponential coupling functions ( [ 4.1 ] ) the hierarchy between the strength of the gravitational couplings to the visible and dark sectors is protected from quantum corrections at first loop .",
    "here we focus our attention on the exact solutions for the couplings given by ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "the metric @xmath91 given by eq.([2.3 ] ) defined on the target space @xmath92 can be written as follows @xmath93    the form of coupling functions ( [ 4.1 ] ) is motivated by two features .",
    "first , in @xcite it was proved that the target space @xmath94 with the metric ( [ 4.2 ] ) is a homogeneous space isomorphic to the coset space @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the isometry group of @xmath92 and @xmath51 is the isotropy subgroup of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , in this case one can find solutions to the geodesic equations ( [ 2.9a ] ) .",
    "second , it was shown in @xcite that cosmic acceleration in the jordan frame requires an inverse proportionality of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it should be noted that the exponential coupling functions give us a target space with constant curvature @xmath97(see , appendix a ) .",
    "the quadrature ( [ 2.19 ] ) takes the form now @xmath98 it is worth noting that a replacement @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a certain constant , yields to the @xmath101-gordon equation , which is well known in quantum field theory @xcite and presents the simplest integrable model of the affine toda field theory , based on the root data of the lie algebra @xmath102 @xcite .    introducing a new variable @xmath103 and redefining the parameters",
    "@xmath104 one can rewrite ( [ 4.3 ] ) in the following form @xmath105    we can easily recognize in eq.([4.5 ] ) the equation of motion of the higgs scalar field considered as the inflaton @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , the case of exponential coupling functions ( [ 4.1 ] ) gives rise to a quartic polynomial for the integrand ( [ 4.5 ] ) and the solution for @xmath20 can be obtained in the terms of elliptic functions @xcite .",

    "as shown in fig.1 , in this case , the relative error for the energy estimated under the formula ( [ 2.15 ] ) with potential given by ( [ 2.16 ] ) and using relations ( [ 4.25])-([4.26 ] ) stays below @xmath208 , which guarantees the correctness of the exhibited solution .    ) for a set of parameters satisfying the condition ( [ 6.2b ] ) are presented . on short time",
    "scales , the two scale factors in the jordan frame evolve in the same way as shown by the enlarged plot .",
    "but on larger time scales , the numerical integration exhibits an accelerated expansion , as opposed the solution in terms of lambert @xmath193-function .",
    "this difference comes from the fact that the analytical formula only keeps first order terms of the expansion .",
    "nevertheless , this allows one to check the general validity of the numerical approach .",
    "the bottom plot displays another approach to control this validity by evaluating the relative error in energy conservation at each time step .",
    "as shown here , this error stays below @xmath208 , thus providing a guarantee for the numerical result . ]",
    "the numerical integration allows one to move away from the condition ( [ 6.2b ] ) ; thus one can obtain larger values of the scale factor on shorter time scales . fig.2 and",
    "fig.3 illustrate the behavior of the numerical solution for the scale factor in the jordan frame and its acceleration for other sets of parameters in the third case ( @xmath209 , @xmath210 ) .",
    "it worth emphasizing that the global shape is the same as in fig 1 . , but the figure shows that very large accelerations can be achieved with this model on relatively short time scales . the full numerical analysis and computational investigations of each solution obtained in this work",
    "will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this work we have constructed solutions for a 4-dimensional model of the generalized brans - dicke theory with a non - universal coupling , using a combination of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the description of the ordinary and the awe - sectors of the matter content are given in terms of scalar fields non - universally coupled to gravitation via the conformal functions @xmath166 and @xmath211 . the kinetic terms of these fields can have either positive or negative signs .    in the einstein frame , we presented the considered action as a model with a sigma - model source term for the scalar fields . assuming the flat flrw background , we have shown that the einstein equations in this frame are trivial . at the same time , the scalar field equations correspond to geodesic equations on the target space of a sigma - model decoupled from gravitation .",
    "we have reduced the sigma - model to a one - component lagrangian with a potential and have found the solutions for arbitrary coupling functions .",
    "the solutions for the scalar fields describing the visible and invisible sectors are determined by the solution for the dilaton @xmath20 and the forms of the coupling functions .",
    "we have considered the case when the couplings are given by reciprocal exponential functions .",
    "the choice of coupling functions yields a the higgs - like equation for the dilaton . depending on the signs of the kinetic terms of the scalar fields ,",
    "there are five cases of solutions for the scalar fields in terms of elliptic functions . under conformal transformations , the five cases of solutions for the dilaton yield five various forms of the scale factor in the jordan frame .",
    "since the couplings are represented by combinations of elliptic functions it turns out to be difficult to derive explicit formulae for the scale factors in the jordan frame with dependence on the jordan time .",
    "however , we have obtained an approximate analytical solution in terms of exponential functions when the matter sector is described by a scalar field with an ordinary kinetic term and when a phantom scalar field corresponds to the awe - sector .",
    "this approximate solution is defined for a special case of the parameters : a small value of the scalar charge @xmath73 for the scalar field describing ordinary matter and a sufficiently large value of the scalar charge @xmath74 related to the dark sector . for this matter content case ,",
    "the solution in the jordan frame has been studied numerically , see fig.2 .",
    "by contrast to the analytical approximate solution , which is valid at very small times , the numerical one can be suitable for the description of an accelerated expansion .",
    "a natural extension of this work would be a detailed analysis of the conditions in which an accelerated expansion is possible .",
    "further study is of interest in the context of the inflationary scenario and hence would include estimation of the expansion rate of the universe and of the number of e - folds .",
    "in addition , retracing the dynamics for the other four scale factor cases using numerical calculation is a topic of a forthcoming publication .",
    "the present work has been focused on solutions for the flat flwr background . at the same time , investigation of the model for an anisotropic metric ansatz would be very attractive , since the coupling functions which given in terms of reciprocal exponential functions might lead to interesting dynamics .",
    "however , in the case of a non - diagonal anisotropic metric , one should use the adm formalism as was done in @xcite .",
    "here we have also briefly discussed the influence of the quantum corrections on the hierarchy of the gravitational couplings to the matter content for the coupling functions given by reciprocal exponential functions . in this case , we have shown that the hierarchy is protected from quantum corrections at first loop .",
    "it would be of interest to perform a detailed analysis of the higher order quantum corrections and its influence of the stability of solutions .",
