    "in the last century we had learned that the hadrons , including the nucleon ( @xmath2 ) and the nucleon excitations ( @xmath3 ) are not pointlike particles and have their own internal structure .",
    "the structure of those states is the result of the internal constituents , quarks and gluons , and the interactions ruled by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the last decades experimental facilities such as jefferson lab ( jlab ) , mami ( mainz ) and mit - bates accumulated information ( data ) about the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon resonances , parametrized in terms of structure form factors for masses up to 3 gev  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models had been proposed to interpret the nucleon resonance spectrum and the information associated with their internal structure  @xcite .",
    "different models provide different parametrizations of the internal structure in terms of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "some of the more successful models are the constituent quark models ( cqm ) based on nonrelativistic kinematics like the karl - isgur model  @xcite and the light front quark models ( lfqm ) defined in the infinite momentum frame  @xcite . in those extreme cases , nonrelativistic models or lfqm , the kinematics is simplified . in general , however , the transition between the nonrelativistic and the relativistic regimes is not a trivial task .    in this work",
    "we discuss the @xmath4 transition , form factors for @xmath3 negative parity states .",
    "the definition of the wave functions of the nucleon ( mass @xmath5 ) and a nucleon excitation ( mass @xmath6 ) , in terms of the internal quark degrees of freedom can be done first in the rest frame of the particle , and extended later for a moving frame , using a lorentz transformation . in a nonrelativistic framework the mass and energy of the state are not relevant for the definition of the states .",
    "moreover , the orthogonality between the nucleon and @xmath3 is ensured , since the wave functions are independent of their masses . to understand the complexity of the generalization of the orthogonality condition from a nonrelativistic framework for a relativistic framework , we consider the example of charge transition , @xmath7 , between a spin 1/2 negative parity state ( @xmath8 ) and the nucleon ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the projection of @xmath7 in the nucleon and @xmath3 states at zero square momentum transfer ( @xmath9 ) is proportional to the overlap between wave functions .",
    "one can show that in a relativistic framework the overlap is proportional to @xmath10  @xcite . in a framework where we can neglect the mass difference between the states ) or as the heavy baryon limit , when the terms on @xmath11 can be neglected .",
    "] we obtain @xmath12 , for the case where @xmath2 and @xmath8 have the same momentum ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we then conclude that in the nonrelativistic limit the orthogonality between states is naturally ensured .",
    "in a relativistic framework the imposition of the orthogonality condition is more complex , since the nucleon and the resonance @xmath8 can not be at rest in the same frame , and the boost changes the proprieties of the states . as a consequence , states that are orthogonal when the mass difference can be neglected",
    "may not be orthogonal when the mass difference is taken into account .",
    "the problem about how to define a wave function of a nucleon excitation that generalizes the nonrelativistic structure of the state and it is also orthogonal to the nucleon was already discussed in the context of the covariant spectator quark model for the negative parity resonances , @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the solution at the time was to define the radial wave functions for the @xmath3 states in order to ensure the orthogonality with the nucleon state .",
    "the price to pay was the introduction of a new momentum scale parameter in the radial wave functions , to be determined by the phenomenology .    in this work",
    "we discuss an alternative approach . instead of focus on the necessity of imposing the orthogonality between states",
    ", we assume that the mass difference is not the more relevant factor and treat the two states as different states with the same mass @xmath13 , defined by the average @xmath14 .",
    "we call this approximation the semirelativistic approximation , since we keep features of the nonrelativistic regime ( no mass dependence ) and maintain a covariant description of the states .",
    "the great advantage of the previous assumption is that , as explained in detail later , one can relate the radial wave function of the resonance @xmath8 with the radial wave function of the nucleon , increasing the predictive power of the model .",
    "later on , we discuss how to calculate the transition amplitudes using the form factors defined in the equal mass limit .    in this work we will show that , the results from the semirelativistic approximation compare well with @xmath15 and @xmath16 form factor data  @xcite , particularly for large square momentum transfer ( @xmath17 ) , and also with the estimates of the valence quark contributions to the transition form factors  @xcite . at low @xmath18",
    "the agreement is not so good , since the meson cloud contributions are expected to be important and even dominant in some transitions  @xcite .",

    "<S> the representation of the wave functions of the nucleon resonances within a relativistic framework is a complex task , particularly for resonances with negative parity . in a nonrelativistic framework </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonality between states can be imposed naturally . in a relativistic generalization , however , the derivation of the orthogonality condition between states can be problematic , particularly when the states have different masses . in this work we study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states using a relativistic framework . </S>",
    "<S> we considered wave functions derived in previous works , but impose the orthogonality between the nucleon and resonance states using the proprieties of the nucleon , ignoring the difference of masses between the states ( semirelativistic approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wave functions are then defined without any adjustable parameters and are used to make predictions for the valence quark contributions to the transition form factors . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions compare well with the data particularly for high momentum transfer , where the dominance of the quark degrees of freedom is expected . </S>"
