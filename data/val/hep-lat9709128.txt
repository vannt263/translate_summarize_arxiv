    "the importance of the instanton content of @xmath0 gauge theory comes through both the intrinsic importance of understanding the ground state of qcd and the role instantons are conjectured to play in light hadron structure .",
    "cooling is a technique for removing the high - frequency non - topological excitations of the gauge - field .",
    "however , during cooling instantons are also removed ; either if they are very small ( lattice artifacts ) or through @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "we use under - relaxed cooling to reduce the latter problem .",
    "also , on the cooled configurations there is still the problem of extracting the instanton properties ; for this we have developed pattern - recognition algorithms .",
    "we present results for 20 configurations at @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 lattices .",
    "the gauge update for under - relaxed cooling @xcite is implemented in each cabibbo - marinari subgroup as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gauge link that minimises the action , @xmath8 the original link , @xmath9 is the under - relaxation parameter and @xmath10 a normalisation constant . under - relaxed",
    "cooling increases the number of _ calibrated _ sweeps needed to annihilate an @xmath1 pair ; for a given value of @xmath9 a calibrated sweep is the number of sweeps needed to destroy a @xmath11 instanton . with no under - relaxation",
    "one occasionally finds a very narrow instanton broadening out under cooling ( presumably because of its environment ) .",
    "we have not observed this with ( significant ) under - relaxation .",
    "we chose @xmath12 and our measurements were carried out between 23 and 46 cooling sweeps ( corresponding to between 10 and 20 cooling sweeps at @xmath13 ) .    on the cooled configurations we first find all the local extrema of the symmetrised topological charge density , @xmath14 , relative to the @xmath15 block surrounding each point .",
    "( we do not consider the action , @xmath16 , as it clearly records less structure . )",
    "each peak is treated as a linear superposition of the topological charge of the object at that point , calculated from a lattice - corrected formula , plus a contribution from every other object on the lattice , calculated from the continuum formula .",
    "a self - consistent set of widths is then found by iteration .",
    "these are our candidate instantons .",
    "summing up @xmath14 over the lattice and comparing it to @xmath17 shows a discrepancy .",
    "we define @xmath18 and impose filters on our candidate instantons .",
    "the parameters of the filters are chosen to minimise @xmath19 .",
    "we have a `` spatial '' filter to remove spurious peaks due to ripples on large objects and a `` width '' filter .",
    "the latter compares the width calculated above with the width calculated from the charge within a radius 2 ( or 3 ) of the peak using a lattice - corrected formula ; a peak is only included if the various widths are in sufficiently good agreement .",
    "full details will appear elsewhere  @xcite .    in figure 1",
    "we show the instanton size distribution for @xmath4 at 23 sweeps .",
    "[ figure1 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    the distribution is peaked around @xmath20 .",
    "the best fit to the large-@xmath21 tail of the distribution is @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "as one would expect , the total number of instantons is found to vary rapidly with the amount of cooling .",
    "however the average size and the form of the small / large @xmath21 tails varies much less .",
    "we note that our results are consistent with those of @xcite but not with those of @xcite .",
    "the fact that the impact of a cooling sweep does not scale complicates the scaling analysis .",
    "figure  2 shows that we can tune the number of cooling sweeps so as to get scaling when comparing @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "[ figure2 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    examining the number of unlike charges a distance @xmath24 away from each peak ( normalised by the volume of the shell ) gives the distribution that is shown in fig 3 ( for @xmath4 after 23 sweeps ) .",
    "[ figure3 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    it is uniform at long distances and amplified at short distances .",
    "the corresponding distribution for like charges is uniform at long distances and suppressed at short distances .",
    "this implies some screening of instantons by anti - instantons in the vacuum  as expected .    calculating @xmath25 where @xmath26 is",
    "the number of objects of size @xmath21 and @xmath27 is the charge carried by objects of size @xmath21 shows that the charge carried by small ( large ) instantons is correlated ( anti - correlated ) with the sign of @xmath28 ( figure  4 ) .",
    "indeed our results suggest over - screening of large instantons by small anti - instantons .",
    "[ figure4 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm",
    "the wilson - dirac operator , or equivalently @xmath29 , may have vanishing or almost - zero eigenvalues for certain values of @xmath30 . moreover , it has been shown that the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath31 are strongly localised in space - time @xcite .",
    "`` exceptional '' configurations are assumed to be related to the appearance of ( almost-)zero eigenvalues at some @xmath32 .",
    "they seem to be more frequent at smaller @xmath33 and with sw improvement . on the other hand ,",
    "it is unclear if and how these zero modes are related to the topology of the underlying gauge field , in particular because the chirality @xmath34 of the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath35 of @xmath36 is typically much smaller than one . to clarify this relation we investigate the low - lying eigenmodes of @xmath37 using a modified conjugate gradient method  @xcite .",
    "we verified that the index theorem is realized on single instanton configurations ( generated as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for both improved and unimproved wilson fermions , with one right - handed ( 4 right - handed plus 3 left - handed ) zero modes in the range @xmath38 for anti - periodic ( periodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "this is in complete analogy to the results for 2-dimensional wilson and for staggered fermions @xcite .",
    ".position @xmath39 and chirality @xmath40 of the zero - mode for single instantons without ( with ) improvement .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for anti - periodic boundary conditions , the eigenmodes are localised and centered on the instanton . moreover , we find considerable effects from discretization errors and sw improvement which are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we also investigated the localisation of the lowest eigenmodes on four exceptional configurations encountered by ukqcd at @xmath2 on @xmath41 and @xmath42 lattices . in all cases",
    "the ( almost-)zero mode is localized close to a small ( @xmath43 ) instanton ( less than @xmath44 away ) .",
    "the chirality has the same sign as the topological charge of the topological object but is not correlated with the overall topological charge of the configuration .",
    "this provides some evidence that exceptional configurations are related to small instantons in the underlying gauge field .",
