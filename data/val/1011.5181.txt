    "[ sec : intro ]    conformal field theories ( cfts ) are partially characterised by the identification of their primary operators and the knowledge of the conformal dimensions of these operators .",
    "the second crucial characterisation of a cft is given by the structure constants which determine the operator product expansion ( ope ) between two primary operators .",
    "@xmath6 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory is an important example of an interacting four dimensional cft which has been thoroughly studied because of the ads / cft duality with string theory  @xcite . in particular , in the recent years huge",
    "progress has been made in the computation of the planar contribution to the conformal dimensions of non - protected operators for any value of the coupling constant , using integrability .",
    "on the other hand , very little is known about the structure constants .",
    "conformal symmetry determines the 3-point functions up to an overall coupling - dependent constant @xmath7 . in the simple case of scalar primary operators",
    "their 3-point function takes the form @xmath8 is the dimension of the operator @xmath9 . in order to be able to define the structure constant @xmath7 unambiguously , it is important to normalised the 2-point functions of @xmath9 to one .",
    "namely , @xmath10    in principle it is possible to tackle the problem of finding @xmath7 both at weak and at strong coupling . in the first case the structure constants are extracted from the 3-point correlators among gauge invariant operators , while in the second case one needs to compute the partition function of iib string theory in ads@xmath11 with appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately neither of these approaches can be currently used to explicitly evaluate the structure constants as an exact function of t  hooft coupling ( @xmath12 ) even in the planar limit .",
    "our current knowledge of the ope coefficients is essentially based on a perturbative expansion around @xmath13 , where standard feynman diagrams can be used to evaluate the relevant gauge theory correlators , or around @xmath14 where the iib string theory is well approximated by a simpler description . by comparing the 3-point correlators among half - bps operators in these two different limits , the authors of  @xcite conjectured that the corresponding structure constants are non - renormalised ( i.e. they have a trivial dependence on the t  hooft coupling ) . on the contrary",
    "the 3-point correlators among non - protected operators receive quantum corrections , as it is shown , for instance , by the correlator between three konishi operators  @xcite . on the gauge theory side",
    ", the authors of  @xcite studied systematically the structure constants for operators with only bosonic fields and computed the corrections arising from the planar 1-loop feynman diagrams .",
    "the importance of the operator mixing for the operators participating in the correlators was stressed in @xcite . on the string theory side",
    "it is more difficult to extract information about non - protected ope coefficients , since , in the supergravity limit , all non - protected operators acquire large conformal dimension and decouple .",
    "the bmn limit  @xcite represents a different approximation , where it is possible to extract useful information on non - bps structure constants .",
    "recently , another approach to the calculation of n - points correlators involving non - bps states was developed @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the authors of @xcite argued that it should be possible to obtain the correlation functions of local operators corresponding to classical spinning string states , at strong coupling , by evaluating the string action on a classical solution with appropriate boundary conditions after convoluting with the relevant to the classical states wavefunctions . in @xcite ,",
    "the 2-point correlator of vertex operators representing classical string states with large @xmath0 spin was computed and agreement with the 2-point function of twist 2 operators , at strong coupling , was obtained .",
    "finally , in @xcite the 3-point function coefficients of a correlator involving a massive string state , its conjugate and a supergravity state was computed .",
    "this was done by taking advantage of the known classical solutions corresponding to the 2-point correlators of operators dual to massive string states .",
    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows . in section 2.1",
    ", we consider a particular analytic continuation of the gubser - klebanov - polyakov ( gkp ) folded string @xcite which is believed to be the gravity dual of the large spin twist 2 operators .",
    "the analytically continued solution describes the propagation of a string extending along a light - like direction on the boundary of the @xmath0 into the bulk and back to the boundary .",
    "we use the action of this solution to calculate the 2-point function of twist 2 operators at strong coupling , holographically . to achieve this we have to perform a legendre transform of the dimensionally regularised action with respect to the angle conjugate to the spin of the string @xmath1 . in section 2.2",
    "we apply the aforementioned method to obtain the 2-point function of twist j operators , while in section 2.3 the 2-point function of operators dual to string states with one large spin in @xmath0 and two large and equal spins in @xmath4 is calculated . in all cases , both the spacetime structure and the scaling dimension of the operators is correctly recovered .",
    "in section 3 , we use the formalism of @xcite to evaluate the 3-point function coefficient , at strong coupling , of a correlator involving the two operators with spin @xmath1 considered in sections 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3 , and a bps state . again",
    "the role of the solutions written in section 2 is crucial .",
    "the 3-point correlator is essentially obtained from a fattened witten diagram where the supergravity state propagates from a point on the boundary of @xmath15 to a point on the worldsheet of the classical solutions describing the tunneling strings of section 2 @xcite .",
    "our expressions for the two and three point functions are valid for any value of the ads spin @xmath2 and can be applied both at the case of long and short strings . for long strings , @xmath16 , the structure coefficient appears to be proportional to @xmath17 and independent of the spin @xmath1 at leading order for the twist j operators , while it scales as @xmath3 for the case of the operators with two equal angular momenta in @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath18 is characterising the bps state which transforms in the @xmath19 $ ] representation of @xmath20 . for short strings , @xmath21 ,",
    "the structure coefficient is proportional to @xmath22 , which is the energy of the short string state .",
    "we close section 3 by commenting on the possibility of obtaining the strong coupling 3-point function coefficient of three twist 2 operators from the minimal surface of the six gluon scattering amplitude in @xmath23 sym .",
    "[ sec:2-pointgen ] in this section , we consider a particular analytic continuation of classical string solutions having a large @xmath0 spin .",
    "the continuation is done both at the worldsheet time , as well as , at some of the target space coordinates in such a way that the @xmath15 coordinates of the solution remain real .",
    "furthermore , the signatute of the target space remains minkowskian .",
    "thus one can have a nice spacetime interpretation of the solution . as we will see",
    ", it appears as a string tunneling from the boundary to the boundary of the @xmath15 space .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the solution we start from which lives entirely in the bulk of @xmath15 and never touches the boundary",
    ". then we use this solution to evaluate the 2-point functions of the dual operators holographically .",
    "this is achieved by performing a series of legendre transforms of the corresponding action with respect to the angles conjugate to the angular momenta of the string .",
    "the anomalous dimension of twist 2 operators has been studied extensively , both at weak coupling @xcite for theories with different amounts of supersymmetry and at strong coupling @xcite , for the maximally supersymmetric theory . in this section",
    ", we will calculate the 2-point function of twist 2 operators at strong coupling , by means of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this will be achieved by writing down a solution of the polyakov action that describes a string which tunnels from the boundary to the boundary of the @xmath0 space .",
    "once we perform a legendre transform of the classical action of this solution , it is possible to get the dimension as well as the spacetime dependence of the 2-point function , as this is dictated by conformal invariance .",
    "the starting point is the gubser - klebanov - polyakov ( gkp ) solution @xcite which has been argued to be the strong coupling dual of twist 2 operators with large spin @xmath1 .",
    "we scematically write these operators as @xmath24}+ ... $ ] , where @xmath25 is a scalar field , e.g. in @xmath23 sym it can be thought as one of the six scalars of the @xmath23 supermultiplet and @xmath26 is a covariant derivative along a light - cone direction .",
    "the dots stand for mixing terms having fermions or gluons instead of scalars as well as for terms where the derivative are distributed differently among the two scalars .",
    "the gkp solution written in global coordinates reads : @xmath27,\\ , \\sigma \\in [ 0,2 \\pi]\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a maximal circle of the @xmath29 of @xmath0 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the solution of the equation @xmath32 describes a folded closed string which rotates at the centre of @xmath0 with spin @xmath33 and energy @xmath34 . its tips , which are at @xmath35 , approach the boundary of the @xmath15 space , which in global coordinates is at @xmath36 , as the spin scales to infinity @xmath37 .",
    "one can calculate the energy of this solution and verify that for large enough spin it is given by the expression @xmath38 on general grounds , one expects to find an expression of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the so - called cusp anomalous dimension which can be expanded either around weak or strong coupling .",
    "on the gauge theory side , @xmath5 should be interpreted as the dimension @xmath41 of a large spin twist 2 operator , according to ads / cft . from one",
    "can immediately read the first term in the strong coupling expansion , namely @xmath42 .",
    "in general , it is believed that @xmath43 is a smooth interpolating function connecting the two perturbative expansions . indeed , assuming that @xmath23 sym is integrable , one can , in principle , compute as many terms in the expansion around both weak and strong coupling as one wishes .",
    "although the solution is perfectly fine for calculating the cusp anomalous dimension , it is not appropriate for calculating the 2-point function of twist 2 operators holographically .",
    "this is because the string of lives entirely in the bulk of @xmath15 and it never touches its boundary .",
    "what we need is a string solution that tunnels from the boundary of @xmath0 to the boundary , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "this solution can be constructed from by rewriting it in embedding coordinates : @xmath44 obviously , can be embedded in a @xmath45 subspace of the full @xmath0 .",
    "we can now analytically continue the world - sheet time @xmath46 while at the same time we perform an analytic continuation to the embedding coordinates of the form @xcite : @xmath47 taking into account , yields : @xmath48 let us now comment on the solution .",
    "firstly , we would like to note that because of the double wick rotation of , the target spacetime is defined by @xmath49 and as a consequence it remains minkowskian .",

    "taking into account that the boundary of @xmath0 is defined by the relations @xmath56 we conclude that we have a string extending along a light - like direction on the boundary at @xmath50 that propagates in the bulk to end on the boundary again at @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit where the spin @xmath1 , and as a consequence @xmath35 tends to infinity , the tips of the string touch the boundary writing light - like segments @xcite .",

    "what follows , we will evaluate the 2-point correlator of two twist 2 operators at strong coupling . to this end , we need to calculate the action of the euclidean world - sheet solution of",

    "an important comment is in order . in general the exact solution to the equations of motion derived from",

    "it is enough to know the solution up to order @xmath89 too , that is the unperturbed solution .",
    "the reason for this is that the action is divergent like @xmath90 .",
    "integration in the action is finite and the simple pole in @xmath88 comes from the @xmath91 integration . ] then apparently one needs to know the solution up to order @xmath92 . but",
    "this is not necessary because when expanding the lagrangian density of the action @xmath93 in terms of @xmath88 , the second term @xmath94 is zero due to the equations of motion derived from @xmath95 .",
    "i n the relations above we have used the expansions @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath28 is an arbitrary field of the lagrangian and @xmath98 the solution to the equations of motion derived from @xmath99 . consequently , to evaluate the action up to order @xmath100 we need the the zeroth order solution , which we know , and the dimensionally regularized lagrangian which we also know .",
    "we are now in position to evaluate the action @xmath101 of the solution that corresponds to a string propagating from boundary to boundary .",
    "it is given by @xmath102 to get the second line of we have used the virasoro constraint .",
    "one final step is needed before we are in position to calculate the 2-point function .",

    "we should also mention that the value of the energy e appearing in the last equality of are the exact ones .",
    "there is no large @xmath16 approximation . plugging and in the expression for the action we get",

    "we would like to comment on the spacetime dependence of .",
    "we have chosen to put the two operators at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "this association is , somehow , ambiguous from the sting theory point of view because the tunneling string is extending from @xmath60 to @xmath61 at @xmath50 and similarly from @xmath62 to @xmath63 at @xmath53 .",

    "the presence of a number of covariant derivatives is effectively producing a displacement of the scalar fields along the light - cone direction of the derivative .",
    "as the spin grows , the effective displacement also grows , and in the limit of infinite spin the displaced insertions of the first operator , which approach @xmath120 and @xmath121 , become light - like separated with respect to the displaced scalar fields of the second operator , which approach @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the displaced scalar fields of each operator are , of course , joined by a wilson line .",

    "let us only mention that @xmath193 is the spherical harmonic corresponding to the chiral primary participating in the 3-point correlator .",
    "we can now make use of in order to evaluate the fusion coefficient of . by plugging in the classical solution which corresponds to the non - bps twist j operator of one gets @xmath195 here we have also made use of the fact that @xmath68 and that the bps operator has dimension @xmath196 .",
    "the two first terms inside the integral come from the @xmath0 part of the solution while the @xmath197 term from the @xmath4 part .",
    "it may appear natural that if one is interested in long ( @xmath59 ) string solutions one could substitute in the approximate solution @xmath198 and then perform the integrals to obtain the 3-point coefficient .",
    "indeed , if we substitute this solution in we get equation ( 4.25 ) of @xcite and as a consequence the same fusion coefficient .    however , this approximate large @xmath1 solution is not accurate enough to give the @xmath199 corrections to the fusion coefficient .",
    "here we choose to use the exact string solution when calculating the integrals in .",
    "doing so and rewriting the virasoro constraint as @xmath200 we obtain from @xmath201    we see that the integrals with respect to @xmath91 and @xmath202 disentangle and can be performed separately .",
    "the @xmath91 integrals that we need are of the form @xmath203 and @xmath204 we now turn to the @xmath202 integrals that we need .",
    "these are obtained by performing the following change of variables @xmath205 @xmath206 similarly , the other integral with respect to @xmath202 gives @xmath207    we can now write down the fusion coefficient as @xmath208    is the main result of this section .",
    "it is valid for 3-point correlators involving long , @xmath16 , or short , @xmath21 , string solutions with ( @xmath209 ) or without ( @xmath210 ) angular momentum in @xmath4 .",
    "one can , in principle , express all the parameters appearing in the right hand side of in terms of the two angular momenta of the string @xmath1 and @xmath129 .",
    "it is possible take various limits of .",
    "for instance , one can expand for small @xmath157 , keep the leading term and then take the large spin limit @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to the    @xmath211 long string solution    the resulting expression for the fusion coefficient becomes @xmath212    in we have expanded the hypergeometric functions around @xmath213 .",
    "the relevant expansions of @xmath214 are given in the appendix .",
    "the first correction ( subleading term ) is proportional to @xmath215 .",
    "we see that the leading term of the expansion is a constant that depends only on the bps state and not on the quantum numbers of the massive string state .",
    "as mentioned above , only the leading term of is in agreement with the corresponding equation of @xcite ( 4.28 ) , where the fusion coefficient was obtained from the correlator of vertex operators on the 2-dimensional worldsheet .",
    "indeed , the @xmath199 corrections of are absent from ( 4.28 ) of @xcite .",
    "the disagreement arises because in @xcite the approximate string solution was plugged in and this is not accurate enough to give the exact @xmath202 integrals .",
    "instead , we have kept the exact solution and have expanded to get only after we have evaluated all integrals .",
    "another interesting limit is the    @xmath211 short string solution    in this case we set @xmath210 and @xmath21 . then it easy to show @xcite,@xcite that @xmath216 finally , for @xmath217 the fusion coefficient of becomes @xmath218 consequently",
    ", for the case of a short string the fusion coefficient scales as the square root of the spin @xmath219 and is proportional to the energy @xmath5 of the string .",
    "we now turn to the second correlation function involving the massive string state with three angular momenta @xmath221 and the bps operator of at strong coupling . by plugging in the classical solution one gets @xmath222 when @xmath18 is even and zero when @xmath18 is odd .    in @xmath223",
    "we see that the winding number @xmath146 enters only through @xmath224 .",
    "using one can rewrite as @xmath225 the @xmath202 appearing in should be though as a function of @xmath108 which one gets when one integrates the first equation in .",
    "this function is a hypergeometric one and we do not write it since it is not particularly illuminating",
    ". unfortunately this complicated dependence of @xmath202 on @xmath108 make the @xmath202 integrals of very difficult to evaluate .",
    "the @xmath91 integrals are the same as in the previous subsection .",
    "however , one can estimate the behaviour of the fusion coefficient in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "for this it is enough to notice that the denominators of the @xmath108 integrals in increase exponentially with @xmath108 .",
    "taking into account that for large @xmath1 , @xmath226 @xcite we see that in the region where the integrands are essentially non - zero one can approximate the sinus appearing in the numerators with @xmath227 , if @xmath228 .",
    "this approximation leads to the following behaviour of the fusion coefficient @xmath229 it is important to notice the very different scaling of the coefficient of and that of . in the first case ( string solution with two angular momenta @xmath230 ) the coefficient tends to a constant as @xmath59 while in the second case ( string solution with three angular momenta @xmath221 ) it scales as @xmath3 .",
    "plane of the 6-gluon scattering amplitude solution .",
    "@xmath231 are the positions of the cusps .",
    "the dashed lines denote the tips of the strings which almost touch the boundary when the spins @xmath232 . the string which lies on the boundary from @xmath120 to @xmath233 splits into two strings which end on the boundary again extending from @xmath121 to @xmath122 and @xmath234 to @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "the three twist 2 operators will be situated are at @xmath115 , @xmath236 and @xmath116 which are the centers of mass of the three strings when these are on the boundary . ]",
    "we would like to close this section by commenting on the possibility of relating the 3-point function coefficient of three twist 2 operators with very large spin @xmath16 , at strong coupling , to the action of the 6-gluon scattering amplitude of figure 2 . in section 2.1 ,",
    "we have commented on the similarity between the 4-gluon scattering amplitude and a certain analytic continuation of the gkp solution .",
    "this similarity is valid in the infinite spin limit where the string solution describing the tunneling of a string from boundary to boundary does become the solution describing the 4-gluon scattering amplitude .",
    "in fact , one can get the 2-point correlators of section 2 , for the cases of two large spin s operators by subtracting the action of the two small strips of figure 1b from the action of the 4-gluon scattering amplitude of figure 1 .",
    "thus , it may be possible that one can use the known action for the 6-gluon scattering amplitude to extract information about the 3-point correlator of three large spin twist 2 operators .",
    "again in the limit where the spins @xmath237 the tips of each string touch the boundary and a light - like wilson loop with 6 edges emerges .",
    "one can view the minimal surface of figure 2 as the solution for a folded string , sitting on the boundary from almost @xmath120 to almost @xmath233 , that propagates in the bulk and splits into two strings that end on the boundary again , from @xmath121 to @xmath122 and @xmath234 to @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "one would have to subtract the area of the three strips of figure 2 taking this way into account the fact that the corresponding operators have finite spins @xmath238 .",
    "the cross ratios of the scattering amplitude should be , somehow , related to dot products of the three light - like vectors defining the three directions along which we take the covariant derivatives in the three operators",
    ". it would be nice to see if this possibility can be realised or not .",
    "finally , one could hope that the correlators of light - like wilson lines in @xmath23 sym chopped at the end as in figure 1b and figure 2 would be related to correlators of large spin twist 2 operators even at weak coupling , as it happens with the scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we give the expansions of the hypergeometric functions needed to derive equations and .",
    "the integrals of section 3 have the following expansions around @xmath213 @xmath239 @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 where the last term in is not needed for @xmath243 . for the case of short string , @xmath217 , the relevant expansions are @xmath244 and @xmath245        j.  m. maldacena , adv .",
