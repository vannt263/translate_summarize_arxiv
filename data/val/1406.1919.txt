    "the temperature dependence of the neutron skin ( @xmath51 ) is also presented in the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . [ 122 ] . in the case of @xmath43sn",
    "although a small decrease is obtained before the critical temperature , the neutron skin increases of about 3% at temperatures above 1 mev .",
    "this is due to the increasing population of larger single - particle states with larger angular momentum ( _ l _ ) , such as the @xmath47 state , as discussed above .",

    "it has been known that hfbcs is not suitable for drip line nuclei due to the formation of unphysical neutron gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , we limit our calculations up to @xmath43sn nucleus in this part . since both proton and neutron radii increase above the critical temperature , the proton radius weakens the formation of neutron skin in less neutron - rich tin isotopes with the increase of the temperature .    in order to further investigate the increase of the neutron skin with temperature , in fig .",
    "[ 123 ] the neutron partial densities of states ( @xmath52 ) as a function of temperature are displayed for the @xmath43sn nucleus . since temperature impacts mostly the states around the fermi level , the single neutron levels around the fermi level are displayed .",

    "while the neutron partial densities are decreasing below the fermi level , an increase in the partial density of the @xmath47 state just above the fermi level is obtained at high temperatures .",
    "proton partial densities also show a similar behavior : while partial densities decrease below fermi level , an increase is obtained above the fermi level at high temperatures .",
    "this causes an increase in the proton radius . in the case of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 neutron states ,",
    "a more subtle effect is at work : the partial densities decrease up to t=1.0 mev and then increase .",
    "the decrease is due to the temperature effects which are destroying the small occupation number generated by pairing effects . above 1 mev",
    ", these states start to be repopulated by temperature effects , because of their increasing fermi - dirac factors ( feeding from lower energy states ) .        in this section ,",
    "our aim is to investigate the possible relation between the effective mass in symmetric nuclear matter ( or equivalently m*(r=0 ) ) and the critical temperature .",
    "the effective mass is known to impact the level density and pairing correlations which in turn may have an effect on the critical temperature @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "@xmath58 values are ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 for the selected skyrme energy density functionals .    in symmetric nuclear matter , effective masses for the skyrme energy density functionals are defined as @xcite :    @xmath59^{-1 } , \\label{111}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ 150 ] shows the influence of the effective mass values of the skyrme energy density functionals ( eq . ) on the critical temperature of @xmath43sn nucleus .",
    "calculations are performed with 14 different skyrme interactions , keeping the pairing strength constant , @xmath61 @xmath62 , for all interactions used . a correlation between the effective mass and the critical temperature",
    "is obtained , namely with the increase in the effective mass values of the skyrme interactions the critical temperature increases . since",
    "a larger effective mass generates larger level densities and larger pairing gap values ( see lower panel of fig . [ 150 ] ) , the critical temperature at which the pairing correlations are disappearing is also larger .",
    "the pairing gap at zero temperature and the critical temperature are strongly correlated by the @xmath63 law and larger effective mass value generates a higher pairing gap value as expected . to check this interpretation , we also plot neutron single particle energies for the @xmath43sn nucleus with sgi and skx skyrme interactions ( see fig . [ 152 ] ) which have 0.6 and 1.0 @xmath58 values , respectively",
    "sgi interaction has lower effective mass value and predicts larger energy difference between the @xmath49 level and fermi level ( smaller level density ) .",
    "this low level density around the fermi level gives smaller pairing gap value .",
    "therefore the critical temperature value for the phase transition is lowered .",
    "the skx interaction has a larger effective mass and predicts smaller energy difference between the @xmath49 level and fermi level .",
    "hence the level densities and pairing gap are enhanced which eventually causes a larger critical temperature value .",
    "we checked that same calculations with different skyrme interactions give similar result .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of imposing a constant pairing gap , the critical temperature is also constant due to the above relation between the pairing gap and the critical temperature . in this case",
    "the critical temperature dependence of the effective mass vanishes .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the effect of temperature on the effective masses of nuclei .",
    "the total effective nucleon mass is obtained with the product of the effective k - mass and @xmath64-mass @xmath65 .",
    "while the k - mass comes from the spatial non - localities and is obtained from the mean field calculations , the @xmath64-mass is related to the frequency dependence of the mean field @xcite .",
    "the level densities around the fermi level are affected with the changes in the effective mass as discussed above .",
    "therefore the determination of the temperature dependence of the effective mass is an important task for the level density calculations .",
    "the temperature dependence of the effective nucleon mass of nuclei have been previously studied in refs .",
    "the results indicate a decrease of the effective nucleon masses at high temperatures .",
    "therefore the nuclear symmetry energy and electron capture rates in the stellar core collapse , which takes place at 1 - 2 mev temperature are also affected @xcite . in ref.@xcite , the temperature dependence of the effective @xmath64-mass",
    "was investigated with respect to the temperature .",
    "the effective mass was found to decrease which decreases the level density and increases symmetry energy at high temperatures .",
    "the changes in the effective proton and neutron masses might have some effects on astrophysical events ; for example in the electron capture rates of stellar collapses @xcite . since the rate of the electron capture is closely related with the proton and neutron chemical potentials and consequently with the symmetry energy , an increase or decrease in the effective nucleon masses might lead significant changes in these rates .    in this framework , in the left part of fig .",
    "[ 151 ] , the effect of temperature on the effective k - masses ( at r=0 , eq . ) of protons and neutrons are displayed .",
    "the results are shown for @xmath43sn nucleus with sgii interaction .",
    "an increase of the effective neutron mass up to t=1.0 mev is observed in the interior of the nuclei .",
    "thereafter , the effective neutron mass suddenly decreases from t=1.0 mev to t=1.5 mev .",
    "in addition , the increase of the proton effective mass is much more pronounced after the critical temperature .",
    "the change is about @xmath66 for proton effective mass .",
    "although the changes in the effective masses are small in magnitude as mentioned in previous works @xcite , it may be relevant to accurately study its behavior .",
    "to explain the behavior of the effective proton and neutron masses , we rewrite eq .",
    "using the values of the sgii parameters :    @xmath67    the changes in the effective masses depend on the density but not explicitly on the temperature .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the effective masses come indirectly from the temperature dependence of the density .",
    "the total density is displayed in fig .",
    "[ totden ] . in the center of the nucleus , the total density decreases with increasing temperature . therefore the effective mass is expected to increase with increasing temperature , but there is also the effect of the isospin dependent density in eq .",
    ": in the right part of fig .",
    "[ 151 ] , we display the change of the neutron and proton densities with respect to the temperature .",
    "the effect of temperature on the densities are pronounced above t=1.0 mev i.e. , above critical temperature .",
    "after t=1.0 mev , the neutron density decreases and the proton density increases in the interior of the nuclei .",
    "the decrease of the neutron density in the interior of the nuclei is directly linked to by the population of levels above the fermi level , and depopulation of levels below ( see fig . [ 123 ] ) , including the neutron @xmath48 state which contributes to the center of the nucleus . as a result ,",
    "the neutron ( proton ) effective mass @xmath68 at r=0 decreases ( increases ) after the critical temperature .",
    "the present results provide an accurate view of the temperature effects on the effective mass in nuclei . in order to provide a general trend for the behavior of the effective k - mass",
    ", we performed same calculations with other skyrme interactions : sly5 , siii and skm * and also with other nuclei .",
    "the results reveal that the behavior of the effective k - mass depends on the interaction used and nuclei considered .",
    "the k - mass can either increase or decrease , however , the change is small and ranging between @xmath69 and @xmath70 from t=0 mev to t=1.5 mev .",
    "although in most of the calculations temperature dependence of the k - mass is small and taken as constant at first order , our results show that the temperature dependence of the k - mass should not be ignored in the case of an accurate study of the total effective mass at high temperatures .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the pairing properties of different nuclei within the finite temperature hf+bcs framework with skyrme interactions .",
    "the relation between the critical temperature and the pairing gap value at zero temperature generally obeys the @xmath71 equation , depending on the energy difference between the last occupied and first unoccupied states and the interaction used .",
    "the temperature dependence of the neutron skin is also investigated with different nuclei . a substantial increase in the proton and neutron radius of neutron rich nuclei",
    "is obtained above the critical temperatures .",
    "however for less - neutron rich nuclei , the increase in the proton radius cancels out the rapid increase of the neutron skin radius .",
    "the changes in the neutron skin is mainly due to the effect of temperature on the occupation probabilities of the single - particle states around the fermi level .",
    "high temperature causes the occupation of the unoccupied levels which is leading an enhancement in the proton and neutron radius .",
    "a correlation is obtained between the effective mass of skyrme energy density functionals and the critical temperature of @xmath43sn nucleus , relating @xmath72 , t@xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it has been shown that with the enhancement in the effective mass , the level densities around the fermi level and pairing gap increase which eventually leads an increase in the critical temperature .",
    "however this correlation depends on the pairing prescription .",
    "temperature dependence of the effective k - masses of protons and neutrons are also investigated . due to the changes in the proton and neutron densities ,",
    "the effective nucleon masses show rather different fine behavior before and after the critical temperature , which is a new feature .",

    "<S> we study the finite temperature hartree - fock - bcs approximation for selected stable sn nuclei with zero - range skyrme forces . </S>",
    "<S> hartree fock bcs approximation allows for a straightforward interpretation of the results since it involves @xmath0 and @xmath1 s which are not matrices as in hfb . </S>",
    "<S> pairing transitions from superfluid to the normal state are studied with respect to the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the nuclear radii and neutron skin are also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> an increase of proton and neutron radii is obtained in neutron rich nuclei especially above the critical temperature . using different skyrme energy functionals </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the correlation between the effective mass in symmetric nuclear matter and the critical temperature depends on the pairing prescription . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the nucleon effective mass is also investigated , showing that proton and neutron effective masses display different behavior below and above the critical temperature , due to the small temperature dependence of the density . </S>"
