    "avalanche photodiode ( apd ) is widely used in broad fields , such as single molecule detection @xcite , autocorrelated fluorescent decays and quantum information @xcite , to detect extremely weak light signals or even single photons .",
    "the latter is usually named single - photon avalanche detector ( spad ) , which acts as an essential device and may greatly influence the performance of the system in many applications , especially in quantum information fields @xcite .",
    "spads usually works in two different modes : free - running mode and gated mode . for free - running mode ,",
    "the spad is biased above its breakdown voltage to allow an avalanche happens . for gated mode , the spad is commonly biased below its breakdown voltage and avalanche process can only happen in gating time windows when additional gate voltage signals are superimposed .",
    "there are many parameters can be used to quantify the performance of spads , such as clocking rate , dark count rate , detection efficiency , timing jitter and so on . in the past decade , the performance of spad has been greatly improved and can working at gigahertz clocking frequency with up to one hundred megahertz counting rates@xcite .    however , afterpulsing effect of spad severely limits the count rate and applications in precise measurements .",
    "afterpulsing , which is correlated with the ignition avalanche , comes from detrapping of carriers that were trapped by deep energy level in the junction depletion layer @xcite .",
    "the trapped carriers then release from the traps over time by thermal fluctuation .",
    "usually , the release lifetime @xmath0 is dependent on the type of traps and can vary from 10 @xmath1 to several microseconds @xcite , which is usually much longer than that needed for quenching an avalanche .",
    "a releasing carrier may initiate another pseudo detection signal , which is usually called afterpulsing or after pulse , if the spad is biased above the breakdown voltage .",
    "the pseudo signal leads to negative effects on spads applications .",
    "for example , afterpulsing will increase quantum bit error rate in quantum key distribution @xcite and destruct the randomness of quantum random number generator@xcite . in order to reduce afterpulsing ,",
    "another hold - off time depending on @xmath0 is necessary .",
    "the afterpulsing effect is negligible if the hold - off time is much longer than carriers lifetime @xmath0 .",
    "but it is not practical for high - count - rate spads .",
    "many approaches have been proposed to reduce afterpulsing @xcite , but it remains a critical limitation for high - count - rate spads . precisely modeling the behavior of afterpulsing is the foundation to handle this problem .",
    "the trap lifetime @xmath0 of apd can be described by the arrhenius equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath5 is determined by the relevant effective states density , cross section of the trap and temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the carriers releasing probability is then exponential via time @xmath6 . as the types of traps in apd are dependent on practical manufacturing processes , there are thereby variety of traps with different lifetime @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the afterpulsing probability ( ap ) during a detection window @xmath8 contains different exponential components @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 are amplitudes of different exponential components . and @xmath11 means the ap of the @xmath12-th detection window after the ignition avalanche .",
    "recently , different fitting methods have been studied , which employed a broad distribution of different exponential components instead of summating a few dominate discrete ones @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies on afterpulsing effect just focus on its time - dependent probability distribution ignited by a single light pulse , and do not discriminate the situation with single ignition avalanche from that with multiple ones @xcite .",
    "however , it is not the real situation when the spad works continuously for photon detection . in this case",
    ", several avalanches may happen successively within the lifetimes of trapped carriers .",
    "previous works have demonstrated that traps filled with carriers during an avalanche event are much smaller than the total number of traps @xcite .",
    "thus , avalanches happen successively will increase the number of filled traps and hence will enhance the ap .",
    "that is , the ap distribution may be correlated to the avalanching history , while prior studies have not delve down into this physical procedure .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the afterpulsing influence of multi - ignition avalanches on photon detection process of ingaas / inp spad under different gate frequencies and photon intensities and found out that afterpulsing possesses memory effect and thus correlates to the avalanching history .",
    "we call this property as non - markov property @xcite .",
    "we gave out analytical expressions of afterpulsing influences on photon detection in theory .",
    "the afterpulsing influence on photon detection can then be quantified .",
    "we also demonstrated experiments to verify the theory on afterpulsing effect .",
    "the experimental results fitted well with the theoretical model .",
    "the model is instructive to the manufacturing processes and afterpulsing evaluation of high - count - rate spads .",
    "it also offers a new perspective to deal with practical security of quantum communication with imperfect devices @xcite .      considering that trap level distribution is a technological parameter , which is determined",
    "once the product is fabricated and the details have been studied well , we do not deal with specific time - dependent distribution of ap in the next analysis process .",
    "the primary data of @xmath13 can be obtained by experimental measurements .",
    "in addition , it is reasonable to assume that the filling and release processes of different traps are independent as the filling is rare .",
    "we model the procedure according to markovian and non - markov procedure individually .",
    "firstly , we assume that ap distribution is only determined by the latest ignition avalanche as assumed in @xcite , namely , the ap distribution has no memory of prior avalanching history and is markovian .",
    "the probability of an avalanche triggered by laser pulse and dark count can be derived from the poisson distribution and avalanche probabilities of different gates ( detection windows ) are independent identical distribution ( iid ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be the avalanche probability per gate triggered by photon pulse , @xmath11 be the ap of gate-@xmath12 with single - ignition photon pulse and @xmath15 be the total avalanche probability of gate-@xmath16 .",
    "there is no afterpulsing for the first gate .",
    "as we assume that afterpulsing effect comes from the latest ignition avalanche only , the system should have no memory of avalanching history before that .",
    "that is , if gate-@xmath17 avalanches , @xmath18 .",
    "if gate-@xmath17 does not avalanche , gate-@xmath19 is considered . if gate-@xmath19 avalanches , @xmath20 .",
    "if gate-@xmath19 does not avalanche , gate-@xmath21 is considered , and so on .",
    "hence , the average avalanche probability of gate-@xmath16 is @xmath22\\\\ & + ( 1-p_{n-1})\\{p_{n-2}[p+(1-p)p_a(2)]+(1-p_{n-2})\\\\ & \\quad\\{\\cdots\\{p_0[p+(1-p)p_a(n)]+(1-p_0)p\\underbrace{\\}\\cdots\\}\\}}_{(n-1)\"\\}\"}. \\end{aligned } \\label{equ3}\\ ] ] the first term of the equation means if the pre - gate avalanches , the ones before the pre - one are not considered . if the pre - gate does not avalanche , the gate before the pre - gate is under considered , and so on . if ap @xmath11 is small , and only the first order terms are reserved , namely , @xmath23 , then the approximate equation becomes @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{equ4}\\ ] ] see appendix for detailed proof of equation [ equ4 ] .",
    "then , we assume that the system has memory of prior avalanching history and ap distribution is determined by the avalanching history .",
    "thus , the derivation of avalanche probability of gate-@xmath16 is much different from that of markov - like model and the full - expression depending on the avalanching history is very complex .",
    "for example , @xmath25+(1-p)p = p[1+(1-p)p_a(1)]$ ] , @xmath26\\{p+(1-p)[p_a(1)+p_a(2)]\\}+p\\{1-[p+(1-p)p_a(1)]\\}[p+(1-p)p_a(2)]+(1-p)p_1 $ ] . here",
    "we give a formal expression of @xmath15 , and then give the approximate equation of @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath15 can be classified into two sets : gate-0 avalanches in the first set @xmath27 and does not avalanche in the second set @xmath28 .",
    "the second set can be expressed as @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath30    by adopting the same approximation utilized in the markov model , where @xmath23 , then we obtain the approximate equation of equation [ equ5 ] , @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{equ6}\\ ] ] see appendix for detailed proof of equation [ equ6 ] .",
    "in fact , the formal expression is enough for the proof .",
    "comparing equation [ equ6 ] with equation [ equ4 ] , we find that , for both cases , @xmath15 depends on two parameters .",
    "the first one is @xmath14 , the photon - ignition avalanche probability without afterpulsing .",
    "the second one is the ap distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the afterpulsing influence increases via @xmath16 , but the weight of @xmath11 decays exponentially .",
    "the decay rate depends on the base @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , the afterpulsing influence becomes saturation when @xmath16 is large enough .",
    "it is reasonable to truncate @xmath16 to an appropriate value according to the actual value of @xmath14 .",
    "the equation will degenerate into @xmath33 if no afterpulsing exists . however , the influence of afterpulsing of non - markov model is more significant .",
    "the weight of @xmath11 in non - markov case is @xmath34 , which is linear .",
    "but the corresponding weight of @xmath11 in markov - like case is @xmath35 , which decays exponentially .",
    "thus , the markovian approximation holds only for @xmath36 .",
    "the difference between these two model will become more and more significant as @xmath14 or @xmath11 ( or both of them ) increases .",
    "the experiments demonstrated below prove that afterpulsing effect is non - markov .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the laser diode ( ld ) is operated in pulsed mode and is triggered by a modulating signal .",
    "figure [ fig : setup](b ) shows the modulating signal , which includes @xmath37 trigger pulses for every interval @xmath38 .",
    "the trigger frequency @xmath39 and interval time @xmath38 are adjustable .",
    "the spad ( the model of apd is : princeton lightwave pga-300 ) is operated in gated mode without dead time and the gate width is 2.5 @xmath1 .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath40 of the spad is about 10.5% .",
    "the detection gate is triggered by external pulsed signal , as shown in figure [ fig : setup](c ) .",
    "all trigger signals are synchronized .",
    "laser pulses from the ld are attenuated by a adjustable attenuator and then sent into the spad .",
    "the spad outputs a detection signal if an avalanche happens .",
    "the detection signals are input into a time - to - digital converter ( tdc , agilent u1051a acqiris tc890 ) in real time",
    ". the tdc can records the arriving time of every detection signal with a resolution of 50 @xmath41 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 can be modulated by adjusting the attenuator .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is modulated by changing the trigger frequency @xmath39 .",
    "the verification work consists of three experiments . * in the first experiment * , the ap distributions under different trigger frequencies ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 mhz ) are measured with single ( @xmath44 ) and multi - ignition laser pulses ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the average photon number @xmath46 per pulse is set as 0.07 .",
    "the ap @xmath11 is the avalanche probability of gate-@xmath47 after subtracting the dark count . * in the second experiment * , the average photon number @xmath46 is modulated ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) so that the avalanche probability @xmath15 with different @xmath14 can be measured , while the ap distribution @xmath11 varies little .",
    "* in the third experiment * , the afterpulsing distribution @xmath11 is modulated .",
    "the trigger frequency @xmath39 is modulated ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 mhz ) so that the ap distribution @xmath11 becomes different , while @xmath46 is set as constant ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "for all experiments , the dark count rate per gate is under the order of @xmath51 .",
    "the first experiment demonstrates that ap increases as @xmath39 increases ( see figure [ fig : afpprobdist ] ) , where @xmath50 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : afpprobdist](a ) , @xmath52 when @xmath53 mhz , while @xmath54 when @xmath55 mhz , where @xmath11 is the ap of gate-@xmath12 and @xmath56 is the total ap with single - ignition pulse .",
    "it also demonstrates that aps with multi - ignition pulses ( figure [ fig : afpprobdist](b ) ) are much larger than that with single ignition pulse ( figure [ fig : afpprobdist](a ) ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath57 mhz , @xmath58 , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ap of gate-@xmath47 with @xmath37-ignition pulses .",
    "thus , @xmath62 .",
    "it means that ap accumulates as @xmath37 increases .",
    "namely , ap depends on the avalanching history and is non - markovian .",
    "the ap becomes larger as @xmath39 increases .",
    "as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the detection signal output from the spad is about 40 @xmath1 , the saturated processing rate of the discrimination circuit is less than 20 mhz by taking the processing time into account .",
    "thus , @xmath63 drops and is even smaller than expected when @xmath55 mhz . however , the processing rate limitation is not that significant for the experiments because the average photon number @xmath50 , which is small , when @xmath55 mhz .",
    "the second experiment ( see figure [ fig : different pa ] ) shows that the difference between non - markov model and markov model is negligible when @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the difference is significant when @xmath14 is larger , e. g. , figure [ fig : different pa](d ) shows that @xmath66 .",
    "the markov model can no longer fit with the experimental data .",
    "the third experiment gives the differences between non - markov model and markov model with different @xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : different gate ] ) .",
    "there is hardly any difference between these two model when @xmath53 mhz ( @xmath52 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : different gate](a ) .",
    "but the difference becomes @xmath67 for large @xmath16 when @xmath55 mhz ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the experimental results above are all consistent well with the non - markov model . according to the equation [ equ6 ] , the afterpulsing influence on photon detection depends on the product of @xmath14 , the pulse - ignition avalanche probability per detection window , and @xmath56 , the total ap . in figures [ fig : different pa](a ) ,",
    "@xmath68 . and in figure [ fig : different gate](a ) , @xmath69 . in both figures",
    ", the markov model also fits well with the experimental data .",
    "but in figures [ fig : different pa](b),(c),(d ) and [ fig : different gate](b),(c),(d ) , markov model can no longer fit with the data , where @xmath70 is @xmath71 in figures [ fig : different pa](d ) and is @xmath72 in figures [ fig : different gate](d ) .",
    "the non - markov effect will be more significant for higher @xmath56 .",
    "it is really the case for high - count - rate spads , of which the detection period is much smaller than the lifetime of carriers @xcite .",
    "it should be note that detection efficiency of the spad varies when trigger frequency @xmath39 varies . in order to make comparing of ap influence with different @xmath39 ,",
    "the gate voltage loaded on spad is fine adjusted so that detection efficiency varies less ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "otherwise , afterpulsing would be a catastrophe and the spad under @xmath55 mhz could no longer work properly if the voltage remains the same with that under @xmath53 mhz .",
    "in conclusion , we have proved that afterpulsing effect of spad has memory on avalanching history and is non - markov .",
    "we give an approximate expression ( equation [ equ6 ] ) that describes the non - markov effect well .",
    "the theoretical analysis fits well with the experimental results .",
    "the non - markov effect will be more significant for higher @xmath56 .",
    "it is really the case for high - count - rate spads , of which the detection period is much smaller than the lifetime of carriers @xcite .",
    "as it is the embodiment of rarely filling of traps , the non - markov effect of afterpulsing should be general to different types of spads provided that the filling is rare during an avalanching process .",
    "our work makes the principle of afterpulsing effect clearer and is instructive to the manufacturing processes and afterpulsing evaluation of high - count - rate spads .",
    "it also offers a new perspective to deal with practical security of quantum communication due to the imperfection of devices .",
