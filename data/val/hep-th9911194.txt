    "although yang - mills theory and einstein gravity are both based on local symmetries , and include long - range forces at the classical level , they are very different theories . for example ,",
    "yang - mills theory is renormalizable , and due to asymptotic freedom , highly nontrivial in the infrared region ; whereas gravity is nonrenormalizable , and its ultraviolet structure is of the greatest interest theoretically .",
    "there are also great differences between the perturbative feynman rules for the two theories : those for yang - mills theory contain only three- and four - point vertices , while those for gravity can have arbitrarily many external legs .",
    "nevertheless , string theory suggests the heuristic relationship , @xmath10 following from the representation of string amplitudes as integrals over world - sheet variables  complex integrals for closed strings ( gravity ) and real integrals for open strings ( gauge theory )  and the factorization of the closed - string integrand into two copies of the open - string integrand .",
    "this relationship was made precise by kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt )  @xcite for tree - level scattering amplitudes . in this",
    "talk we describe the relations between multi - loop scattering amplitudes in gravity and gauge theory that were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss some of their implications .",
    "multi - loop scattering amplitudes are of considerable interest in both nonabelian gauge theory and gravity ( and their supersymmetric extensions ) . on the gauge theory side , there are practical implications for more precise predictions of jet rates and other qcd phenomena observed in collider experiments . to date , no jet rate computations have been carried out beyond next - to - leading order in the strong coupling @xmath11 , even though in many cases , such as @xmath12 annihilation into three jets , experiment demands one higher order .",
    "two - loop scattering amplitudes are required to calculate such next - to - next - to - leading order corrections .    on the gravity side ,",
    "ultraviolet properties are of primary interest .",
    "although gravity is nonrenormalizable by power counting , and the conventional wisdom is that only string theory could possibly render it finite to all orders , in point of fact no divergence has yet been established for any supersymmetric theory of gravity in four dimensions .",
    "nonsupersymmetric theories of gravity with matter generically diverge at one loop  @xcite , and pure gravity diverges at two loops  @xcite .",
    "however , supersymmetry ward identities ( swi )  @xcite forbid all possible one - loop  @xcite and two - loop  @xcite counterterms in any supergravity theory in @xmath13 .",
    "thus at least a three - loop calculation is required to definitively answer the question of the finiteness of four - dimensional supergravity .",
    "in addition , there is a candidate counterterm at three loops for all supergravities including the maximally extended version ( @xmath14 )  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , divergences were computed in ( higher - dimensional ) @xmath14 supergravity , but only up to two loops .",
    "we expect , though , that the same techniques should be applicable beyond the two - loop level .",
    "in fact , our work suggests a natural conjecture for the divergences appearing at @xmath15 loops ( see section  [ gravdiv ] ) . the conjecture would imply that @xmath14 supergravity in @xmath13 first diverges at five loops , not three loops .",
    "loop amplitudes in @xmath16 supergravity can also be used to extract information about m theory  @xcite . here",
    "the finite parts of the amplitudes are most important , particularly their dependence on the radii of one or two compactified dimensions .    in principle one could investigate higher - loop relations between gravity and gauge theory in superstring theory using the world - sheet representation .",
    "however , at the multi - loop level this becomes technically rather difficult .",
    "also , we would like to study the ultraviolet properties of particle theories of gravity .",
    "recently , the klt relations have been examined at the lagrangian level , by introducing an auxiliary scalar field ( i.e. the dilaton ) into the einstein - hilbert action and carrying out appropriate field redefinitions  @xcite .",
    "however , we wo nt pursue this direction further here .",
    "instead we will use unitarity as a tool .",
    "unitarity has proven very useful for one - loop qcd computations  @xcite , and it has also been applied to two - loop @xmath17 super - yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite . the basic approach is to calculate the unitarity cuts of an amplitude , and then find functions that reproduce all such cuts .",
    "one can construct a perturbative bootstrap from tree amplitudes up to multi - loop amplitudes in this way . in the case of gravity , where the klt relations express its tree amplitudes as",
    "roughly ` squares ' of those of gauge theory , unitarity is particularly effective : the same algebraic steps employed in simplifying the gauge theory cuts can often be recycled in the ( otherwise more complex ) corresponding gravity cuts .",

    "gauge theory relations via unitarity is the set of tree - level relations found by klt  @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that any closed string vertex operator is a product of open string vertex operators , @xmath18 this product structure is then reflected in the amplitudes , written as correlation functions of vertex operators .    for example , the open string tree amplitude for @xmath19 gluons is @xmath20 \\ ,                          \\biggr|_{\\rm lin . } \\",

    "thus gravity calculations can be performed by recycling the simpler yang - mills calculations .",
    "although we have discussed primarily the maximally supersymmetric case , where explicit calculations are the simplest , there should be applications to more general cases as well .",
    "indeed , special one - loop helicity amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of external gravitons have been computed in this way , in both @xmath14 supergravity and pure gravity  @xcite .",
    "we have learned that supergravity amplitudes are less divergent than previously expected . in @xmath13",
    ", it is still true that no supergravity divergence has yet been firmly established .",
    "indeed , our expectations in the maximally supersymmetric case , @xmath14 , are for the first divergence to occur only at five loops , not three loops .",
    "further work in this direction , using the techniques described here , could help to remedy this situation .",
