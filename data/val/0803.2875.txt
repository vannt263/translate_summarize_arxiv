    "equilibrium systems relax to a steady state described by the gibbs distribution .",
    "in contrast , nonequilibrium systems are specified by the dynamics rather then by a hamiltonian , and there is no general framework for describing nonequilibrium steady states . furthermore , unlike equilibrium phase transitions that are characterized by robust universality classes @xcite , nonequilibrium phase transitions are highly sensitive to details of the underlying dynamics @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate polymerization dynamics , and we report that competition between aggregation and fragmentation results in a remarkable non - equilibrium phase transition . despite the fact that the dynamics are perfectly reversible",
    ", there is a nonequilibrium phase transition from a thermodynamic state where the number of polymers is proportional to the system size into a non - thermodynamic state where the number of polymers is not proportional to the system size .",
    "reversible polymerization is ubiquitous in polymer and atmospheric chemistry @xcite , and has analogies in networks @xcite and computer science @xcite .",
    "reversible polymerization includes two competing processes : ( i ) the aggregation process @xmath0+[j]\\to [ i+j]$ ] , merger of two polymer chains of lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 into a larger polymer , occurs with the aggregation rate @xmath3 ; ( ii ) the fragmentation process @xmath4 \\to [ i]+[j]$ ] , breakage of a polymer into two smaller polymers , proceeds with rate @xmath5 .",
    "this process is reversible because the aggregation process and the fragmentation process perfectly mirror each other .",
    "reversible polymerization is described by the master equations @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of polymer chains composed of @xmath8 monomers at time @xmath9 .",
    "the first two terms describe changes due to aggregation and the next two terms account for changes due to fragmentation .",
    "the aggregation and fragmentation rates are ( non - negative ) symmetric matrices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in the simplest case , the steady state distribution is found by equating the aggregation flux with the fragmentation flux , @xmath12 this _ detailed balance _",
    "condition specifies an equilibrium state where the fluxes between any two microscopic states of the system balance .",
    "such an equilibrium steady state exists for example when both the aggregation and the fragmentation rates are constant @xcite .",
    "another equilibrium state was found in a model of strings at very high - temperatures with the rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the detailed balance equation admits a solution only when the aggregation and fragmentation rates satisfy special relations , as shown in appendix [ constraints ] . in general , the steady state distribution is specified by the full master equations and moreover , the detailed balance relations may very well be violated .",
    "for example , in a `` chipping '' process where only end - monomers can detach from the polymer , the matrix @xmath5 is sparse : @xmath15 when both @xmath16 . for constant aggregation rates ,",
    "the chipping process exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "when the fragmentation rate falls below a certain threshold , a giant macroscopic polymer emerges @xcite .",
    "we consider the aggregation and fragmentation rates @xmath17 these rates , while intermediate between the linear chain model @xcite and the string model @xcite , violate detailed balance ( see appendix [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the product aggregation rate accounts for the natural situation in which any two monomers may form a chemical bond , thereby leading to merger of their respective polymers .",
    "this polymerization process has been widely studied in polymer chemistry @xcite and in the context of percolation @xcite .",
    "the constant fragmentation rate reflects situations where all chemical bonds in the linear polymer are equally likely to break , thereby leading to breakage into two smaller polymers .",
    "this de - polymerization process has also been studied extensively @xcite . like the aggregation rate ,",
    "the total fragmentation rate is linear in the molecular weight , @xmath18 .",
    "starting with @xmath19 monomers , we study the nonequilibrium steady states that emerge in the reversible polymerization process .",
    "we find that the system generally reaches a steady state , and that a nonequilibrium phase transition occurs at the critical fragmentation rate @xmath20 .",
    "the average total number of polymers , @xmath21 , grows algebraically with the system size @xmath19 , @xmath22 when fragmentation is weak , @xmath23 .",
    "the total number of polymers grows sub - linearly with the system size because @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , large polymers are likely as the polymer size distribution has a broad algebraic tail .",
    "the system develops this non - thermodynamic state through a gelation transition .",
    "we probe this gelation using moments of the size distribution .",
    "in contrast , the system reaches an ordinary steady state when the fragmentation process is strong .",
    "the average total number of polymers is proportional to the system size , @xmath25 , when @xmath26 .",
    "large polymers become rare since the polymer size distribution has a sharp exponential tail .",
    "interestingly , even though the polymerization process is reversible because the underlying aggregation and fragmentation processes perfectly mirror each other and none of the transition rates vanish , the breakdown of detailed balance leads to a remarkable phase transition involving a non - thermodynamic phase where the number of polymers is not proportional to the system size and a thermodynamic phase where the number of polymers is proportional to the system size .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the thermodynamic steady states that occur under strong fragmentation are examined in the next section , while the non - thermodynamic steady states that emerge when fragmentation is weak are analyzed in section [ nonthermo ] .",
    "the gelation transition is probed using the moments of the size distribution in section [ gelation ] .",

    "the total density is non - zero @xmath35 when the fragmentation rate is sufficiently strong , @xmath36 .",
    "we focus on this strong fragmentation regime in the rest of this section .",
    "let us assume that the system is large but finite with a total mass equal @xmath19 , a state that can be achieved by starting with @xmath19 monomers , for example .",
    "the expected total number of polymers , @xmath37 is proportional to the system size @xmath19 , and therefore , the system is in a thermodynamic state .",

    "very large polymers are rare since the size distribution decays exponentially @xmath39 when @xmath40 .",

    "this expression , obtained in appendix [ infinite ] , is compatible with the generic exponential tail .      the total density , the monomer density , and the dimer density all vanish near the transition point , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",

    "the first two coefficients are @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we substitute this form into the stationary equation and observe that the nonlinear aggregation term @xmath53 is negligible .",
    "consequently , to leading order , the polymer size density obeys the _ linear _ recursion equations    @xmath54    the second equation is obtained from the first by an index shift .",
    "we subtract the two equations and obtain a recursion relation for the coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 the coefficients can be conveniently expressed as a ratio of gamma functions , @xmath57 , by using the identity @xmath58 .",

    ", the size density is algebraic , @xmath60 over a substantial range , @xmath61 .",
    "this result follows from and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the likelihood of finding large polymers becomes substantial as the phase transition point is approached .",
    "the cutoff scale @xmath63 , set by mass conservation , @xmath64 , is divergent @xmath65 the size distribution is sharply suppressed according to beyond this scale . using the relation @xmath66 , derived in appendix [ derivation ] , and @xmath67 we deduce that @xmath68 for @xmath69",
    "indeed , this large size behavior matches the small size behavior at the crossover scale .",
    "we conclude that the convolution term , that accounts for the creation of very large polymers from smaller polymers , is relevant only at very large scales , @xmath69 .",
    "otherwise , this term does not affect the density of small polymers .    for completeness",
    ", we mention that the leading asymptotic behavior of the moments , @xmath70 , readily follows from the density and the cutoff , @xmath71 sufficiently large order moments diverge in the vicinity of the transition point , a consequence of the algebraic tail .",

    "as the critical point is approached , the nonlinear convolution term in becomes irrelevant over the divergent scale . by continuity",
    ", we deduce that the convolution term is negligible when @xmath72 .",

    "similarly , the normalized size densities @xmath79 exhibit a phase transition for all @xmath80 .     versus the normalized monomer density @xmath81 .",

    ", we find that the polymer size density depends on the system size @xmath89 the total number of clusters @xmath90 grows sub - linearly with the system size @xmath91 with @xmath92 as announced in .",

    ", we assumed that the convolution term is negligible .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the fact that the amplitude @xmath94 in vanishes as the system size diverges .",

    ", there are polymers of all possible scales because the power - law behavior holds up to the system size @xmath102 . remarkably , there are polymers that contain a finite fraction of all the mass in the system because according to , the total number of macroscopic clusters , @xmath103 is of the order one",
    ".    the power - law distribution accounts for a competition between two fluxes .",
    "there is a flux of mass from small scales to large scales that is generated by the aggregation process and a flux from large scale to small scales caused by fragmentation .",
    "the power - law behavior holds for all scales , indicating that these two fluxes balance at all intermediate scales .",
    "similar competitions between the fluxes occur in fluid turbulence @xcite , passive scalar advection @xcite , wave turbulence @xcite , granular gases @xcite , and driven aggregation systems @xcite .",
    "however , reversible polymerization differs from these driven system in that there is no external injection of mass to maintain the steady - state .",
    "we now study the approach toward the steady state specified by the full master equation @xmath104 initially , there are only monomers , .    first , we consider the total polymer density @xmath105 that obeys the linear rate equation @xmath106 subject to the initial condition @xmath107 , the total density is @xmath108 hence , the steady state is approached exponentially fast in the thermodynamic phase .",

    "we assume that large order moments diverge algebraically at the gelation time , for @xmath117 , and observe that the last term in the hierarchical equation is negligible compared with the rest of the terms .",

    "the exponent @xmath120 characterizing this divergence is compatible with the near critical behavior .",
    "the divergence is different than the @xmath121 behavior in irreversible fragmentation @xcite , and therefore , fragmentation quantitatively alters the nature of the gelation transition .",
    "we conclude that the solution to the master equation exhibits a finite time singularity .",
    "even though we can not obtain the gelation time @xmath113 exactly , relevant properties of the size density including the moments can still be obtained analytically . in particular",
    ", the form of the size density at the gelation time can be calculated by balancing the fluxes of mass due to aggregation and fragmentation , following the scaling analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider @xmath122 , the total mass density of polymers with size smaller then @xmath123 , @xmath124 according to the master equation , this quantity obeys @xmath125 we now take the @xmath126 limit .",
    "the aggregation loss term accounts for loss of finite size polymers to the infinitely large gel while the fragmentation term accounts for the balancing flux from the gel into small masses .",
    "we require that the two fluxes balance at the gelation point .",
    "we assume that at the gelation point , the size density decays algebraically @xmath127 for @xmath128 , as is the case for irreversible polymerization @xcite . by dimensional",

    "this increased scale enables the gel to withstand fragmentation .",
    "we also comment that the nearly macroscopic size scale provides the appropriate cutoff in , @xmath143 , and that at the gelation point , the upward mass aggregation flux and the downward mass fragmentation flux are nearly macroscopic , that is , they are proportional to the system size up to a logarithmic correction .      for completeness , we discuss kinetics in the critical case @xmath144 where the the cluster density is purely exponential , @xmath145 .",
    "similar decay characterizes the leading behavior of the size density .",
    "for example , the monomer density obeys and consequently , @xmath146 only the first term is relevant asymptotically , . in general , @xmath147 , and by substituting this expression into the time dependent master equation , we observe that the nonlinear term is negligible .",

    "moreover , the polymer sizes are distributed at all scales .",
    "macroscopic gels may exist as well .    in the thermodynamic phase ,",
    "the system quickly approaches the steady state .",
    "the time - dependent behavior is much richer in the non - thermodynamic phase .",
    "the system exhibits a finite - time singularity : large moments of the size distribution diverge at the finite gelation time . at this time , the system nucleates macroscopic gels and the size distribution follows a universal algebraic decay . past the gelation time , there is a second relaxation stage leading the system to a state where there are two balancing fluxes of mass : aggregation transfers mass from small scales to large scales and fragmentation transfers mass from large scales to small scales .",
    "the stationary size distribution is algebraic but the characteristic exponent is not universal .    even though the aggregation process is described by non - linear terms , the analysis in the non - thermodynamic phase involves linear equations because the aggregation gain term is relevant only at the largest scale . nevertheless , formation of gels at the largest possible scale ( in our case , the system size ) is crucial in maintaining a stationary state . understanding the distribution of macroscopic gels is an open challenge , and",
    "our numerical simulations reveal an interesting anomaly with an enhancement of the population of macroscopic gels over the algebraic distribution at the maximal scale .",
    "missing from our calculations is a finite - size scaling analysis @xcite near the phase transition point .",
    "interestingly , the total number of clusters grows sub - linearly , , just below the phase transition point , but linearly just above the phase transition point , .",
    "therefore , the amplitude @xmath165 may very well be divergent , and moreover , there must be an intermediate range of fragmentation rates centered around the critical point with a smooth crossover between the two phases .",
    "the width of this transition region should vanish as the system size increases .",
    "understanding fluctuations is another interesting direction for further research .",
    "we find gaussian fluctuations in the thermodynamic phase and are able to compute the variance @xmath166 but we are unable to obtain in the non - thermodynamic phase .",
    "finally , we checked that the same phase transition generally holds as long as the aggregation rate is asymptotically proportional to the molecular weights ; for instance , when @xmath167 , a class of models that often arise in polymer chemistry @xcite .",
    "a more complete characterization of phase transitions in reversible polymerization is another avenue for future work .",
