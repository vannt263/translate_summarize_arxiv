    "in astrophysics , black holes can be described by only two parameters : their mass @xmath6 and their angular momentum @xmath7 ( parametrized by the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath8 where @xmath9 ) . over the last several decades , estimates of black hole masses",
    "have been obtained by measuring the gravitational influence of the hole on nearby objects such as binary stellar companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , orbiting stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stellar cusps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or dense clouds of ionized gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , measurements of black hole spin are much more difficult to obtain as the spin only significantly affects the shape of space - time out to @xmath10  @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is a gravitational radius ) from the event horizon @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the value of the spin is directly related to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the hole @xcite , and therefore impacts the radiative efficiency of thin accretion disks .",
    "if the accretion flow is rotating in the same sense as the hole , then a larger @xmath13 brings the isco closer to the event horizon , increasing the efficiency that an accretion flow can convert gravitational potential energy into radiation .",
    "a larger fraction of the rest - mass energy is radiated away in a highly efficient accretion disk , reducing the growth rate of the black hole mass .",
    "therefore , measuring the distribution of spins will elucidate the role of steady accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , chaotic accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and black hole mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the build - up of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "x - ray variability and optical microlensing data show that the x - ray source in agns is within 10  @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the accretion disk is likely illuminated by x - rays down to the isco . as spin",
    "clearly impacts the radius of the isco , the extent of the red wing of the relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0  line is a direct measurement of black hole spin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in recent years",
    ", long observations by _ xmm - newton _  and _ suzaku _ have used this method to obtain smbh spin estimates for a small number of bright , nearby seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "these type of spin measurements depend on precise spectral fitting to the broad fe  k@xmath0  line and continuum and are most easily performed on sources with strong fe  k@xmath0  lines .",
    "thus , the larger collecting area provided by the future _ international x - ray observatory _ ( _ ixo _ ) will be necessary in order to extend these types of spin measurements over a significant range of redshift . in the meantime",
    ", attempts have been made to measure the average fe  k@xmath0  line profile by stacking the x - ray data of the many agns detected in deep _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _  surveys over a wide range of redshift and agn luminosity .",
    "if a significant fe  k@xmath0  signal can be detected in the integrated spectrum then , in principle , the average spin of the black holes contributing to the line could be determined .",
    "again , the ability to make this measurement depends crucially on the strength of the integrated fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "@xcite averaged the _ xmm - newton _  spectra of type 1 and type 2 agns detected in the lockman hole and found a strong ( equivalent width [ ew ] @xmath14  ev ) and broad fe  k@xmath0  line that indicated a non - zero spin for the average smbhs in their sample .",
    "however , similar stacking analyses of different datasets by @xcite and @xcite were not able to detect a broad component , with @xcite finding that the ew of the broad component must be @xmath15  ev .",
    "these attempts to measure the integrated broad fe  k@xmath0  line are technically challenging and are limited by the unknown intrinsic distribution of broad fe  k@xmath0  line strengths .",
    "recently , @xcite described a method by which the average ew of the broad fe  k@xmath0  line could be calculated as a function of @xmath16 and luminosity . that paper concentrated on the distribution of likely ews from individual sources , and did not consider the result of integrating lines over specific redshift intervals , a step crucial to measuring the spin evolution of smbhs .",
    "this letter builds on the @xcite method to calculate the integrated fe  k@xmath0  line over several different redshift and luminosity ranges .",
    "we also consider the dependence of agn obscuration on the appearance of the integrated fe  k@xmath0lines .",
    "these predictions show which regions in the redshift and agn luminosity plane will have the largest average broad fe  k@xmath0  ew , and will be vital for guiding current and future attempts to map out the spin evolution of smbhs by fitting the average fe  k@xmath0  line profile .",
    "the calculations are reviewed in the next section , and the results are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : res ] .",
    "the following @xmath17-dominated cosmology is assumed in this paper : @xmath18  km  s@xmath19  mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the mean fe  k@xmath0  ew as a function of @xmath16 and agn @xmath2@xmath3  kev  luminosity , @xmath22 , broadly follows the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite hard x - ray luminosity function ( hxlf ) is combined with the observed agn black hole mass function ( bhmf ) at @xmath23 @xcite to calculate an eddington ratio distribution at a given @xmath22 . in order to predict the integrated fe  k@xmath0  line over several",
    "cosmologically interesting redshift ranges we assume that the bhmf evolves as @xmath24 between @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that the broad fe  k@xmath0  line is produced by a single strong reflection event from a dense , geometrically thin accretion disk that can be approximated by a constant density slab @xcite .",
    "the ew of the iron line depends on the photon index of the illuminating power - law @xmath27 , the relative abundance of iron @xmath28 , the ionization parameter of the disk @xmath29 , and the reflection fraction , @xmath30 , which determines the relative strength of the reflected spectrum in the total observed spectrum @xcite .",
    "the first three of these parameters are known to depend on the eddington ratio of the agn @xcite .",
    "reflection spectra are then computed for each eddington ratio contributing to an observed @xmath22 .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  ew is measured for each spectrum ( assuming @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath2 or @xmath5 ) and averaged over the eddington ratio distribution to give a single value for that @xmath22 . in order for the integrated line to reflect the changes in @xmath29 and @xmath27 ,",
    "we keep track of the average energy at which the fe  k@xmath0  line reaches a maximum @xmath33 .",
    "these calculations are performed for 100 values of @xmath22 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and for 100 values of @xmath16 between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these results can now be included in a x - ray background ( xrb ) synthesis calculation to predict the strength and profile of the integrated broad fe  k@xmath0  line over several different ranges of luminosity and redshift .",
    "the synthesis model used here was last described by @xcite , although we neglect the contribution of blazars for this application .",
    "the integrated rest - frame spectral intensity @xmath36 are computed by evaluating : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xcite hxlf , @xmath39 is the absorbed rest - frame spectrum of an agn with intrinsic luminosity @xmath40 at redshift @xmath16 , and @xmath41 is the luminosity distance to redshift @xmath16 . at each ( @xmath42 ) pair in the integral , a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0  line appropriate for a maximally - spinning ( i.e. , @xmath43 )",
    "smbh is added to the spectrum @xmath44 such that it has the ew predicted by the reflection calculations described above .",
    "the relativistic profile for the line was calculated using the ` laor2 ' model in xspec12 @xcite with a line emissivity of @xmath45 between @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xmath11 and @xmath48 from @xmath47 to @xmath49  @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "the inclination angle of the line emitting material was taken to be @xmath50  degrees , and the rest energy of the line is set to @xmath51 to account for changes in the average ionization state of the line as @xmath22 and @xmath16 are varied .",
    "finally , to be consistent with the calculation of the fe  k@xmath0  lines , the photon index of @xmath39 is derived from averaging @xmath27 over the eddington ratio distribution for a given ( @xmath42 ) pair .",
    "this method translates to average photon indices varying from @xmath52 to @xmath53 depending on the value of @xmath16 or @xmath22 . in practice , this method of determining @xmath27 for @xmath39 has a negligible effect on the results .",
    "the integrated agn spectra are then computed for five different redshift ranges : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for each redshift range ,",
    "five intervals in luminosity are considered : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the ew of the fe  k@xmath0  line is measured by directly integrating the resulting spectra .",
    "the ew measurements are performed separately for type 1 agns ( those with hydrogen column densities @xmath63 ) and type 2 agns ( those with @xmath64 ) , although the ew of the broad line in this model is independent of the obscuration toward the agn .",
    "the impact of obscuration will be discussed at the end of sect .",

    "indeed , for @xmath65 , the ews are between @xmath68  ev and @xmath69  ev .",
    "in fact , even if @xmath66 for every agn , the ew of the integrated fe  k@xmath0  line does not break 320  ev . if the average @xmath30 of agns is closer to @xmath67 then the majority of the integrated broad lines have ews@xmath70  ev .    in the model of fe",
    "k@xmath0  production described here and by @xcite the ew of the line is ultimately a function of the eddington ratio of the agn .",
    "if the smbh is accreting too weakly , there is no optically thick disk for reflection to occur @xcite . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "if the accretion ratio is very close to the eddington limit there is also little observed reflection signature because the disk is very highly ionized @xcite .",
    "the strongest fe  k@xmath0  line arises from recombination onto he - like iron , but this occurs over a relatively narrow range of ionization parameter @xcite , and , therefore , a correspondingly small range of eddington ratios @xcite .",
    "this interplay between eddington ratios and fe  k@xmath0  ews is reflected in the redshift distributions of the integrated ew seen in figure  [ fig : ews ] .",
    "for all agns with @xmath71 the largest integrated ew is found from those with @xmath72 . as @xmath16 increases , the average mass of active smbhs increases , which , at a constant @xmath22 , corresponding to a decreasing eddington ratio .",
    "therefore , the integrated fe  k@xmath0  ew drops as @xmath16 increases because a larger fraction of agns at these luminosities are accreting too weakly to produce a strong disk line . integrating over the entire redshift range ( black lines in fig",
    "[ fig : ews ] ) results in a weighted average of this behavior .",
    "in contrast , the fe  k@xmath0  ews of agns with @xmath73 are largest for @xmath56 and smallest for @xmath72 .",
    "the luminosities of these agns are large enough that ionized fe  k@xmath0  lines contribute significantly at @xmath74 and boost the integrated ew . in this case , the eddington ratios at lower @xmath16 are , on average , too large and the resulting disk lines are weaker . at larger redshifts ,",
    "the increasing smbh mass reduces the average eddington ratio which results in strong neutral fe  k@xmath0  emission .",
    "this discussion illustrates that , for a fixed luminosity range , the integrated line probes smaller eddington ratios as the redshift increases .",
    "elucidating the spin evolution of the smbh population over a fixed interval of mass will require measuring the integrated fe  k@xmath0  line over ranges of progressively higher luminosity as the redshift increases .    at face value , the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] indicate that experiments using the broad fe  k@xmath0  line to measure the spin evolution of smbhs should be targeted toward integrating the spectra of agns with @xmath73 , as these sources are the ones predicted to have the strongest integrated ews .",
    "the difficulty with this strategy is that such agns are rare at all redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus the compilation of suitable samples will be extremely problematic even with the enhanced sensitivity of _",
    "ixo_. therefore , we conclude that agns with @xmath61 will provide the best sample to search for the integrated broad fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "these agns are close to the knee of the hxlf at all redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and will therefore be common enough to provide a useful sample at several different redshift bins",
    ". the broad lines from these agns will show a mixture of of neutral and ionized reflection with @xmath75@xmath76  kev .",
    "examples of the integrated @xmath65 spectra in the @xmath77 range are shown as solid lines in figure  [ fig : lines ] with the colors denoting the redshift ranges as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] .",
    "these spectra were calculated assuming that the fe  k@xmath0  line was being emitted all the way down to the isco of a maximally spinning black hole .",
    "the dashed lines show the integrated spectra if the isco is at @xmath47  @xmath11 , as would be the case for a non - spinning black hole .",
    "as expected , this scenario causes the integrated line to be slightly less broad and more peaked .",
    "this small difference in the line profile should be measurable if a large enough sample of agns could be included in the integral .",
    "this result nicely illustrates the importance of targeting agn in the luminosity range that will produce the most intense integrated broad fe  k@xmath0  line .    the integrated spectra shown in figure  [ fig : lines ] and the associated ews plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] are compiled from only type 1 agns . the dotted blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] plots the integrated type 2 spectrum with @xmath61 and @xmath78 .",
    "our calculations assume that there is no difference in the broad fe  k@xmath0  ew between the type 1 and 2 agns . however , a visual inspection of the type 2 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] seems to indicate a much more intense broad fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "indeed , performing the same integration of the type 2 line gives an ew of @xmath79  ev as compared to @xmath80  ev for the type 1 agn .",
    "the strong absorption in the average type 2 spectrum causes the continuum to curve downwards at energies @xmath81  ev and enhances the fe k edge at @xmath82  kev .",
    "these effects conspire to artificially enhance the ew of the broad fe  k@xmath0line . therefore ,",
    "unless the underlying spectrum and absorption distribution is well known , the search for broad fe  k@xmath0  lines in integrated spectra should only be performed on unobscured , type 1 agns .      performing the integral of eqn .",
    "[ eq : cxrb ] over all @xmath16 and @xmath83 , but now redshifting @xmath44 into the observed frame results in a prediction of the contribution of the fe  k@xmath0  line to the entire xrb .",

    "predictions are shown for @xmath65 ( solid line ) , @xmath2 ( short - dashed line ) and @xmath5 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the long - dashed line plots the ratio for a model where the broad line has a constant ew of 100  ev and results from neutral reflection . in all of these cases",
    "the line is broadening using the ` laor2 ' model as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : calc ] , except for the dotted line which plots the @xmath65 model with all lines arising from @xmath47  @xmath11 ( also using the ` laor ' model ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows that the maximum contribution of the broad fe  k@xmath0  line to the xrb is @xmath47% , but , since intense reflection can not be a common occurrence in agns @xcite , the contribution is more realistically much less than @xmath5% .",
    "these values are in agreement with the previous predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the contribution of integrating multiple observed - frame spectra and relativistic blurring smears the fe  k@xmath0  contribution over 6  kev  in energy , but there is a slight difference between the profiles with different spin distributions .",
    "therefore , given a very high quality spectrum of the x - ray background , the total integrated fe  k@xmath0  profile will be able to determine the average spin of smbhs over cosmic time .",
    "measurements of the spin distribution of smbhs will have profound consequences on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the only direct way to measure smbh spins is via the broad fe  k@xmath0  line in agns , and attempts have been made to measure the fe  k@xmath0  profile in the spectrum of agns that have been integrated over a range of @xmath16 and @xmath84 .",
    "the accuracy and precision of these measurements will be maximized if the spectral fitting can be performed on fe  k@xmath0  lines with the largest possible ew .",

    "in fact , if @xmath65 for most agns , the integrated broad component will have an ew between 100 and 200  ev . taking into account the relative space density of agns , it is recommended that the search for integrated broad fe  k@xmath0  lines be confined to agns with luminosities in the range @xmath85 .",
    "it is further recommended that these experiments be limited to type 1 agns .    stepping back from the quantitative results",
    ", this letter has shown that measuring the spin evolution of smbhs can be done with the broad fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "in fact , _ ixo _  will be perfectly placed to obtain this goal , as its sensitivity will allow it to obtain the high - quality spectra necessary to measure the broad fe  k@xmath0  lines .",
