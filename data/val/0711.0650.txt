    "an important prediction of quantum theory is the existence of irreducible fluctuations of electromagnetic fields even in vacuum , that is in the thermodynamical equilibrium state with a zero temperature .",
    "these fluctuations have a number of observable consequences in microscopic physics for example in atomic physics the van der waals force between atoms in vacuum .",
    "vacuum fluctuations also have observable mechanical effects in macroscopic physics and the archetype of these effects is the casimir force between two mirrors at rest in vacuum .",
    "this force was predicted by h. casimir in 1948 @xcite who considered two plane parallel perfect reflectors as shwon in figure [ casimir ]    and found an interaction energy @xmath0 depending only on geometrical parameters , the mirrors distance @xmath1 and surface @xmath2 , and two fundamental constants , the speed of light @xmath3 and planck constant @xmath4 @xmath5the signs have been chosen to fit the thermodynamical convention with the minus sign of the energy @xmath0 corresponding to a binding energy .",
    "the casimir energy for perfect mirrors is usually obtained by summing the zero - point energies @xmath6 of the cavity eigenmodes , substracting the result for finite and infinite separation , and extracting the regular expression ( [ ecas ] ) by inserting a formal high - energy cutoff and using the euler - mclaurin formula @xcite .",
    "the casimir force was soon observed in different experiments which confirmed its existence @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have reached a good precision , in the % range , which makes possible an accurate comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental observations @xcite .",
    "casimir considered an ideal configuration with two perfectly reflecting mirrors in vacuum .",
    "but the experiments are performed with real reflectors , for example metallic mirrors which have a perfect reflection only at frequencies below a plasma frequency @xmath7 or alternatively for mirror separations much larger than the plasma wavelength @xmath8 characetristic for the metal .",
    "accounting for this imperfect reflection and its frequency dependence is thus essential for obtaining a reliable theoretical expectation of the casimir force in a real situation .",
    "the consideration of real mirrors is important not only for the analysis of experiments but also from a conceptual point of view .",
    "real mirrors are certainly transparent at the limit of high frequencies and this allows one to dispose of the divergences associated with the infiniteness of vacuum energy .",
    "this point was already alluded to in casimir s papers and an important step in this direction was the lifshitz theory of the casimir force between two dielectric bulks @xcite .",
    "however this idea was fully implemented in theoretical derivations after a quite long period .    in the limit of small separations",
    "@xmath9 , the casimir effect has another interpretation establishing a bridge between quantum field theory of vacuum fluctuations and condensed matter theory of forces between two metallic bulks .",
    "it can indeed be understood as resulting from the coulomb interaction between surface plasmons , that is the collective electron excitations propagating on the interface between each bulk and the intracavity vacuum @xcite .",
    "the corresponding field modes are evanescent waves and have an imaginary longitudinal wavevector . at short distances , surface plasmon modes",
    "are known to dominate the interaction and the casimir energy reduces to @xcite @xmath10    surface plasmons play an important role in many fields of physics .",
    "let us only mention as recent examples the surface plasmon assisted enhancement of the transmission of light through metallic structures @xcite or in the context of biomolecular physics , the importance of plasmon fluctuations of a 2-dimensional wigner - like crystal where they can generate an attractive component to the dispersion forces between parallel surfaces @xcite .    here , we derive and expand in more detail the results previously given in ref .",
    "@xcite , investigating more closely the influence of surface plasmons on the casimir energy , not only at short but at arbitrary distances .",
    "we restrict our attention to the situation of two infinitely large plane mirrors at zero temperature so that the only modification of the casimir formula ( [ ecas ] ) is due to the metals finite conductivity .",

    "will be described by scattering amplitudes which depend on the frequency , wavevector and polarization while obeying general properties of stability , high - frequency transparency and causality .",
    "the two mirrors form a fabry - perot cavity with the consequences well - known in classical or quantum optics  : the energy density of the intracavity field is increased for the resonant frequency components whereas it is decreased for the non resonant ones .",
    "the casimir force is but the result of the balance between the radiation pressure of the resonant and non resonant modes which push the mirrors respectively towards the outer and inner sides of the cavity @xcite .",
    "this balance includes not only the contributions of ordinary waves propagating freely outside the cavity but also that of evanescent waves .",

    "expression ( [ ereal ] ) holds for dissipative mirrors as well as for non dissipative ones @xcite .",

    ", we adopt an adiabatic mode definition , where we follow it continuously from the evanescent into the propagative sector and attribute the whole mode to the surface plasmon modes , which we call `` plasmonic modes '' @xcite .",
    "this denomination is chosen in order to avoid confusion with the ( common ) definition of surface plasmon modes which defines them as evanescent modes only and cuts the @xmath28 mode into two pieces .",

    "it does not change its sign and , in agreement with @xcite , at long distances goes as @xmath71 with this definition we therefore naturally find the result that the contribution of the evanescent modes to the casimir energy is always attractive and reproduces well the short distance behavior of the casimir energy .",
    "as a concluding remark we would like to stress that , no matter how we attribute the propagative part of the @xmath28 mode , whether to the surface plasmon modes in an adiabatic definition ( plasmonic modes ) or to the propagating modes , the influence of surface plasmons is very important at all distances .",
    "the casimir energy is the detailed balance of two very large contributions of opposite sign which nearly cancel each other , but not quite , the difference being a small casimir energy , much smaller than each of both contributions",
    ".    it might be interesting to investigate if a change in the photon - plasmon coupling could somehow influence this detailed balance and therefore the value or even the sign of the casimir force .",
    "a different coupling could be obtained by using for example nanostructured surfaces .",
    "for such an analysis the adiabatic mode definition should be well suited , because for a different coupling the mode will change _ as a whole _ and in following continuously the mode one could trace back the changes introduced through the structured surface ."
