    "symmetry principles are of fundamental importance in physics . for instance",
    "the standard model of elementary particle physics rests on the principle of local gauge symmetries .",
    "these symmetries do not only guarantee the observed conservation laws but also ensure the physical consistency of the quantum field theory .",
    "especially no unphysical degrees of freedom for the vector particles appear falsely in the particle spectrum .",
    "this ensures the causality and the positive definiteness of probabilities ( in the vacuum case especially the unitarity of the s - matrix ) .",
    "though fulfilled for the exact theory such symmetry concepts are commonly violated in most of the approximation schemes , in particular if partial resummations are performed . in this paper",
    "we address the question of global symmetries for dyson resummation schemes based on the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) action formalism @xcite also known as @xmath0-derivable approximations @xcite . here",
    "@xmath0 denotes the 2pi part of the generating functional @xmath1 . as baym could show such approximations have the property that expectation values of the noether currents",
    "are exactly conserved and the solutions are thermodynamically consistent .",
    "these properties even survive a consistent gradient approximation of the kadanoff - baym equations leading to generalized quantum kinetic equations @xcite which dynamically treat the full spectral functions of the particles and therefore permit a consistent transport treatment of resonances .    in the first paper of this series @xcite , in the following referred to as [ i ] , we could verify an other important property of this type of approximations , namely that of renormalizability , provided the original theory is renormalizable in the standard sense . using the path integral techniques @xcite within the schwinger - keldysh real time formalism ( for details and the notation conventions used here",
    "see [ i ] ) closed equations for the renormalized self - consistent quantities with a counter term structure solely defined at the vacuum level could be established .",
    "first examples which include the fully self - consistent approximation at second order in the coupling , i.e. , including the tadpole and the sunset self - energy diagrams , were given in the second part of this series @xcite , referred to as [ ii ] .    while for the solution to @xmath0-derivable approximations the expectation values of noether currents are exactly conserved ,",
    "this is no longer guaranteed at the correlator level or for higher order vertex functions .",
    "thus in general the ward - takahashi identities ( and thus also the symmetries of the underlying classical action ) are violated already for the self - consistent self - energy .",
    "this was seen by baym and grinstein investigating various approximations for the o(@xmath2)-model @xcite .",
    "considerations related to symmetries in approximation schemes were conducted already very early , e.g. , in investigations of superfluid helium within non - relativistic many - body theory@xcite . at that time the notion of gap - less approximations was coined in the context of nambu - goldstone modes in spontaneously broken phases . in some recent attempts",
    "the same phenomena were investigated in @xcite comparing various regularization and renormalization techniques , while in @xcite the equations of motion were modified by introducing mean - field dependent effective vertex functions in the approximations at the gap - equation level .    in this paper",
    "we like to investigate the symmetry aspects of approximation schemes at a quite general level fully within the 2pi functional approach . in sect .",
    "[ sect - wti ] we derive generalized ward - takahashi identities for the 2pi action functional .",
    "this is done in close analogy to the corresponding investigations for the usual perturbative quantum action functional ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "thereby we prove the following properties of the 2pi action functional formalism : provided the symmetry is realized as a linear representation on the fields and is free of anomalies the considerations show the following :    1 .   if the 2pi action is truncated in a systematic way ( loop expansion , @xmath3 expansion ) it fulfills the same symmetries as the classical action if both , the classical fields and the green s functions , are simultaneously transformed as tensors of the symmetry representation of 1@xmath4 and 2@xmath5 rank , respectively .",
    "2 .   for the solutions of the corresponding self - consistent dyson equation : 1 .",
    "expectation values of noether currents are conserved .",
    "2 .   the scheme is void of double counting and fulfills detailed balance relations and is thus thermodynamically consistent .",
    "however , ward - takahashi identities at the correlator level and for higher order vertex functions can be violated .",
    "the latter problem is expected for such partial resummation schemes since from the point of view of the exact theory , which fulfills the symmetry , this expansion is of course incomplete .",
    "diagrammatically it is easy to see that in general @xmath0-functional based partial dyson resummations already violate the crossing symmetry of vertex functions in orders of the expansion parameter beyond that chosen for the truncation of the @xmath0-functional . as an important result of this paper it will be shown in sect",
    ". [ sect - eff - act ] how to overcome these problems .",
    "the strategy is that for any @xmath0-derivable approximation based on a truncated 2pi action @xmath6 $ ] one always can construct a non - perturbative approximation for the effective quantum action on top of the self - consistent solution which indeed recovers the symmetry in the above cited sense .",
    "this effective action , called @xmath7 $ ] is symmetric . it is expressed in terms of self - consistent propagators @xmath8 $ ] at a given mean field and provides a non - perturbative approximation to the usual 1pi quantum - action functional .",
    "this action was already considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where the identity of vertex functions derived from @xmath1 and @xmath9 has been shown for the exact case . here",
    "we concentrate on the consequences of truncation schemes , where both pictures are no longer equivalent . rather in terms of perturbative diagrams ,",
    "the new action indeed supplements that minimal set of extra diagrams needed to recover the symmetry for the restricted set of diagrams resummed by the @xmath0-derivable dyson scheme .",
    "the extra terms are encoded in a special bethe - salpeter equation and higher vertex equations which precisely cope with the chosen @xmath0-derivable scheme .",
    "formally the functional derivatives of this effective action with respect to the background field , taken at the stationary point , define non - perturbative approximations to the self - energies and proper vertex functions which fulfill the usual ward - takahashi identities .",
    "we call the so generated vertex functions _ external _ , as they do not take part in the self - consistent scheme but are rather constructed a posteriori , once the self - consistent dyson solutions are given . in this way",
    "symmetry - conserving non - perturbative approximations to these quantities are provided .",
    "it is shown that this also holds true for the renormalized physical quantities . since the external vertex functions are defined as usual by multiple functional derivatives of the effective action all symmetries inherent in this functional like crossing symmetry",
    "are guaranteed for the solutions .",
    "we shall concentrate on the properties of the self - energy , which , if derived from @xmath9 , respects the symmetries ( e.g. , posses nambu - goldstone modes ) .",
    "this general scheme , however , permits to repair the symmetry of any other higher order vertex functions such as the correlators of noether currents @xmath10 , which then are conserved in contrast to the ones given by the underlying self - consistent dyson resummation .    in sect .",

    "we explicitely see here that a symmetric generating functional by itself does not guarantee that the solution of the equations of motion , i.e. , the dyson equation , preserves the symmetry .",
    "rather the here presented functional scheme to construct _ external _ vertex functions is the minimal procedure to cure the corresponding symmetry defects .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed baym s @xmath0-derivable approximations with respect to their symmetry properties .",
    "it was shown that the self - consistent mean field and propagator solutions of such approximations in general do not fulfill the ward - takahashi identities of the full propagator as derived from the usual 1pi generating functional , i.e. , the effective action .",
    "the reason for that lies in the fact that , although the expansion of the _ 2pi - functional _ is done systematically in a symmetry - conserving ordering scheme ( for instance in powers of some coupling constant of a symmetric term in the lagrangian , the @xmath32- or the @xmath3-expansion ) the _ solutions _ of the equations of motion correspond to an incomplete resummation to any order of the expansion parameter . in general not even crossing symmetry is respected for the solutions beyond the order of the expansion parameter .",
    "furthermore it could be shown , though , that for any such truncated dyson resummation scheme it is always possible to define a non - perturbative 1pi - effective action based on the self - consistent solution .",
    "this supplementary action indeed generates proper @xmath73-point vertex functions which fulfill the whole hierarchy of ward - takahashi identities .",
    "these _ external proper vertex functions _ are implicitly determined by _ closed _",
    "vertex equations of bethe - salpeter or higher order type , where all ingredients are constructed from the self - consistent mean field and the self - consistent propagator resulting from the underlying @xmath0-derivable dyson scheme .",
    "the corresponding solutions exactly recover the crossing symmetry and at the same time the symmetries of the original classical action provided there are no intervening anomalies .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0-functional formalism was used to determine the self - consistent mean fields and propagators does not only avoid double counting but also ensures the consistency of counter terms , needed for renormalization of the divergent integrals .",
    "this is valid for both , for the 2pi functional @xmath134 $ ] and its equations of motion as well as for the here discussed higher order vertex equations like the bethe - salpeter equation resulting from the effective quantum action @xmath247 $ ] . in the simple hartree approximation the symmetry repairing procedure leads to the well known random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "similar features result for the leading order @xmath3 expansion of the 2pi functional . for approximation levels with genuine two - point self energies ,",
    "i.e. , for problems with damping , one arrives at bethe - salpeter equations of ladder type , as they were considered , e.g. , in the context of hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummations or of photon production @xcite , which in semi - classical approximation leads to classical transport equations .",
    "although the effective 1pi - action formally fulfills all the symmetry properties of the original action it now suffers other defects essentially resulting from the lack of self - consistency for the so constructed _ external _ multi - point functions . their internal structure is inherited from the self - consistent ( e.g. , hartree ) propagators : since the latter do not fulfill the ward - takahashi identities it is not guaranteed that they show the correct dynamical behavior .",
    "for instance in the case of the here considered o(@xmath2)-model in the spontaneously broken nambu - goldstone phase without explicit symmetry breaking the transverse ( `` pionic '' ) degrees of freedom have a non - zero mass in the self - consistent propagator and thus all `` pion '' loops show a wrong dynamical behavior ( e.g. , the vacuum `` @xmath11 '' spectral function shows a threshold at @xmath248 which is finite rather than zero ! ) .",
    "another consequence of this symmetry problem at the internal level is the wrong prediction of a first order phase transition .",
    "both , the here considered 1pi and the 2pi effective actions @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] have the same values at the solution of the self - consistent solutions for the mean fields and propagators and therefore represent a non - perturbative approximation for the thermodynamical potential .",
    "this implies that the symmetry violation at the internal level may also leaves its traces in this thermodynamical potential .",
    "the derivation of approximation schemes that fulfill all symmetry properties of the underlying classical action and at the same time are fully self - consistent still remains as an open task .    in a forthcoming publication",
    "we shall discuss the symmetry properties for the specially interesting case of local gauge symmetries . here",
    "the background field method permits to establish an explicitly gauge - invariant non - perturbative effective action on the basis of the 2pi - action @xcite , which leads to vertex functions that formally fulfill the ward - takahashi identities . in this case",
    ", however , the symmetry violation by the intermediate 2pi approximations causes even more serious complications , namely the excitation of unphysical degrees of freedom for the gauge field propagators .",
    "the latter fact may imply artifacts in the external proper vertex functions which among others even may spoil thermodynamic consistency due to the false number of degrees of freedom in the internal lines . here",
