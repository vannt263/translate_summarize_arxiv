    "through decades of study on quadruply gravitationally lensed quasars , it has been well established that simple mass models of lensing galaxies  a monopole plus a quadrupole  are fairly successful in describing the overall surface density of matter in a lensing galaxy .",
    "however , these models give no indication of the type of matter present , whether it is in a smooth , dark matter component , in a clumpy component like stars or dark matter sub - halos , or in some combination of the two ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mass models are smooth by design , but it has become clear that some small - scale structure , i.e. , some clumpiness , must be present in the lensing galaxies . much of the observational evidence for this comes from the `` flux ratio anomalies '' seen in several systems , in which the simple mass model correctly predicts the locations of the quasar images but fails on the relative fluxes of those images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the small - scale structure further lenses the background quasar with little effect on the positions of the images but large effect on their brightness .",
    "arguments were put forth for two leading candidates ( stars or dark matter halos ) that might constitute this small - scale structure . in the case of _ milli_lensing , dark matter condensations of @xmath1@xmath2  @xmath3  are responsible @xcite , whereas in the case of _ micro_lensing , stars in the lensing galaxy are responsible @xcite .    our previous study of flux ratio anomalies in 10 systems ( paper i ; * ? ? ? * ) as well as studies of individual lenses such as rxj1131@xmath41231  @xcite and pg1115@xmath5080  @xcite provide very strong evidence that microlensing is the primary cause of the flux ratio anomalies .",
    "we have shown that the flux ratios are more anomalous in x - rays than at optical wavelengths .",
    "this is because the optical emitting region of the quasar accretion disk is comparable in angular size to the einstein radii of the microlensing stars while the x - ray emitting region is considerably smaller .",
    "if millilensing were responsible for the anomalies , there should be no chromatic effect between x - rays and optical ( contrary to what is seen ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since both regions would be essentially point sources compared to the einstein radius of a dark matter sub - halo .",
    "in addition , we would not expect temporal variation of the flux ratios within a human lifetime in the case of millilensing , whereas they are naturally expected to vary on timescales of months to years in the case of microlensing ( as is indeed observed ) .    because the x - rays come from a region much smaller than the einstein radii of the microlensing stars , they offer a much cleaner signal of microlensing than what is available from the optical , which gives a convolution of microlensing and the finite size of the optical emitting region of the quasar .",
    "@xcite explored the microlensing effects of different fractional contributions of stars and dark matter to the total surface density , especially in regard to the probability of strong observable microlensing effects on saddle point images .",
    "they found that the probability of a strong demagnification of a saddle point image , which is often seen in the observations , was relatively low for stellar fractions of 2% and 100% but became appreciable for stellar fractions of 5%25% ( see , e.g. , their figure 3 ) .",
    "they exploited this finding to determine the most likely stellar fraction for an ensemble of 11 lensing galaxies at the typical impact parameter of image formation @xcite .",
    "they noted , however , that their analysis produced inconsistent results unless they assumed that the optical continuum emitting regions had an extended component .",
    "as we showed in paper i , this is indeed the case , and it complicates the use of the optical data for dark matter determinations . the x - rays , coming from essentially a point source region as far as the microlenses are concerned , do not suffer such complications and offer a much more promising avenue .    in @xcite",
    ", we applied the technique of @xcite to _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "observations of pg1115@xmath5080  and constrained the dark matter fraction to @xmath680%95% at a characteristic distance of @xmath66 kpc from the center of the lensing galaxy . in this work , we extend that analysis to _ chandra _  observations of 14 gravitational lenses : he0230@xmath42130  ( 1 obs . ) , mgj0414@xmath50534  ( 7 obs . ) , he0435@xmath41223  ( 1 obs . ) , rxj0911@xmath50551  ( 2 obs . ) , sdssj0924@xmath50219  ( 1 obs . ) , he1113@xmath40641  ( 1 obs . ) , pg1115@xmath5080  ( 6 obs . ) , rxj1131@xmath41231  ( 22 obs . ) , sdss1138@xmath50314  ( 1 obs . ) , h1413@xmath5117  ( 2 obs . ) , b1422@xmath5231  ( 3 obs . ) , wfij2026@xmath44536  ( 1 obs . ) , wfij2033@xmath44723  ( 1 obs . ) , and q2237@xmath50305  ( 12 obs . ) .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section [ sec : xray - obs ] .",
    "our analysis of the x - ray data to obtain fluxes for each of the four images in each observation is presented in sections [ sec : spectralanalysis ] and [ sec : imageanalysis ] .",
    "the bayesian microlensing analysis is given in section [ sec : dm ] , and we discuss the results in sections [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we summarize our findings in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we utilize publicly available _ chandra _  observations of 14 x - ray bright quadruply lensed quasars .",
    "all data were downloaded from the _ chandra _  archive , and reduction was performed using the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software , version 4.2 .",
    "all observations were taken with the telescope aimpoint on the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) s3 chip .",
    "the data were reprocessed using the caldb4.3.0 set of calibration files ( gain maps , quantum efficiency , quantum efficiency uniformity , effective area ) including a new bad pixel list made with the acis_run_hotpix tool .",
    "the reprocessing was done without including the pixel randomization that is added during standard processing .",
    "this omission slightly improves the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the data were filtered using the standard _ asca _ grades and excluding both bad pixels and software - flagged cosmic - ray events .",
    "intervals of strong background flaring were searched for , and a few were found . in all cases ,",
    "the flares were mild enough that removing the intervals would have decreased the signal to noise of the quasar images since it would have removed substantially more source flux than background flux within the small extraction regions .",
    "therefore , we did not remove any flaring intervals .",
    "the observation ids , dates of observation , and exposure times are given in table  [ tab : xrayfluxes ] .",
    "for each observation of each system , we extracted events in large regions which enclosed all four images of the quasar .",
    "we fit the spectra of these events to determine the total flux  detected in each observation . later , as we describe in section [ sec : imageanalysis ] , we perform two - dimensional image fitting to determine what fractions of  to assign to individual images .    the source extraction regions were 492 in radius , and we extracted background counts from an annulus around each system with an inner radius of 738 and an outer radius of 1476 . for each observation",
    ", we simultaneously fit the source and background spectra in sherpa 4.2 @xcite using modified @xcite statistics ( `` cstat '' in sherpa ) and the @xcite optimization method ( `` simplex '' in sherpa ) .",
    "both source and background were modeled as absorbed , independent power laws .",
    "the absorption column density was fixed at the galactic value in the direction of the lens based on the maps of .",
    "these simple spectral models are meant only to reproduce the gross x - ray spectral shape for flux estimation and not to test for the presence of additional features such as extragalactic absorption or spectral emission lines ; nonetheless , the reduced fit statistics indicate more than adequate agreement between the simple models and the x - ray data .",
    "fits were performed over the 0.58 kev energy range .",
    "the best fit power - law index , reduced cstat statistic , and unabsorbed x - ray flux are reported in table  [ tab : xrayfluxes ] for each observation .    to calculate the uncertainties in the x - ray fluxes",
    ", we used the sherpa tool `` sample_energy_flux . ''",
    "this tool used 1000 samples of the power - law index and amplitude from their normal distributions to calculate 1000 values of the 0.58 kev flux .",
    "the standard deviation of that flux sample is reported as the uncertainty on the x - ray flux in table  [ tab : xrayfluxes ] .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , we rely on two - dimensional fitting to determine the relative x - ray intensities of the four quasar images in each system . in this work",
    ", we have explored several strategies to achieve the best determinations of these relative intensities .",
    "first , we make three sky images of each observation at a resolution of 00492 per pixel using events in the 0.38.0 kev energy range .",
    "the first image comprises all events in the reprocessed level 2 event list , and we refer to this as a `` standard '' image .",
    "the second and third images are made after applying the subpixel event repositioning ( ser ) algorithm of @xcite and either including all split - pixel events or including only the corner - split events .",
    "we refer to these images as the `` ser '' image and the `` ser - co '' image , respectively .",
    "these ser images were made with the aim to improve the determination of the x - ray intensities by improving the effective _ chandra _  spatial resolution .",
    "their efficacy is discussed below .",
    "the main idea behind the ser method is that a charge cloud split between two or more ccd pixels can be better positioned based on the distribution of charge among the pixels .",
    "the corner - split events provide a more precise repositioning of the event but are much fewer in number ( see section [ sec : sercomp ] ) .",
    "the models we use to fit the images consist of a fixed background level determined from a large , source - free area near the system plus four other components to represent the four quasar images . in all cases ,",
    "the four components are fixed in their relative positions to each other , with the absolute position allowed to vary to the best fit location .",
    "previously , we used two - dimensional gaussians for these components , with each of the four gaussians in a fit constrained to have the same full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) but allowing the specific value of the fwhm to vary to the best - fit value .",
    "we repeat that analysis using gaussians , and we now also explore other choices to model the quasar images . our aim is to find the best representation of the x - ray data that yields the smallest uncertainties in the model amplitudes , i.e. , the individual fluxes of the four quasar images .    lllrrrrrrrcc[t ! ] 1 & he0230@xmath42130 & 2000 oct 14 & & 14.8 & 0.494@xmath7 &

    "it is also consistent with the recent work of @xcite , which considered optical and infrared data and found dark matter fractions of 50@xmath335% , 80@xmath336% , and @xmath33750% in mgj0414@xmath50534 , sdssj0924@xmath50219 , and q2237@xmath50305 , respectively .",
    "those authors performed a marginalization over the source size parameters in their analysis .",
    "a distinct advantage of the work presented here is that our x - ray analysis is unencumbered by source - size considerations .",
    "we formed two subsets of the lensing galaxies based on the mean impact parameters where their images formed and found that their most likely stellar fractions varied both qualitatively as expected  higher stellar fractions closer to the centers of the lensing galaxies  and quantitatively as expected .",
    "in addition , we find a most likely stellar fraction of 100% for q2237@xmath50305 , which has a mean impact parameter about an order of magnitude smaller than all of the other lens systems we studied .",
    "our measurement of integrated stellar fraction as a function of impact parameter opens up the possibility of mapping out the dark matter content of lensing galaxies in a direct and straightforward manner , with minimal assumptions , based solely on high quality x - ray observations of lensed quasars .",
