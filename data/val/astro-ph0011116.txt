    "accreting black holes , both stellar ( including the galactic @xmath2quasars ) and supermassive , show strong , soft , thermal components in their euv  x - ray spectra , when accreting above certain fraction of eddington rate .",
    "this component is thought to come from an optically thick accretion disk , and its spectrum is usually modeled as a simple , multi - color blackbody . for re - examining a number of such spectra , i will use the spectral models described in @xcite .",
    "an example of is is the may 18th observation of gs  1124 - 68 ( nova muscae 1991 ) .",
    "using first the frequently employed but unphysical model , diskbb + smedge(powerlaw ) , gives an unacceptable fit , @xmath3 .",
    "adding a gaussian line at 6.4 kev does _ not _ improve the fit , unless the line width is @xmath4 kev ( @xmath5 ) . allowing the line energy to be free",
    "gives @xmath6 for @xmath7kev .",
    "these values have little to do with fe spectral features , but rather indicate that it is the continuum shape that is not properly modeled .",
    "using now the diskbb + thcomp + rel - repr model gives very bad fit , @xmath8 .",
    "replacing the diskbb component with a comptonized blackbody ( comptt ) results in a dramatic improvement , @xmath9 .",
    "thus the best fit is obtained for the proper physical description of x  ray reprocessing and the _ comptonized blackbody _",
    "model for the soft component .",
    "the same effect is observed in gro j1655 - 40 , gs  2000 + 25 and xte j1550 - 564 ( ycki et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "nova muscae 1991 was in the high state when observed on mar 18th .",
    "the spectrum shows a strong soft component , and the hard component is negligible @xcite .",
    "modeling the spectrum with the diskbb + thcomp model gives @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ zycki_tiii-06:fig1 ] ) .",
    "the comptonized component is steep and makes a significant contribution to the soft component .",
    "again , the soft component has to be described by a model _ broader _ than the multi - color disk blackbody .      on jan 11th , while still on the rise to the peak of the outburst , nova muscae 1991 , showed a spectrum consisting of two comptonized components : the softer one again _ can not _",
    "be described by the diskbb model .",
    "it can be modeled as comptonization of @xmath11 kev blackbody by a warm , @xmath12 kev , optically thick , @xmath13 , plasma .",
    "the additional comptonization seems to be a common feature of disk - dominated spectral states of accreting black holes .",
    "there are two possible scenarios to explain it .",
    "the first one is comptonization in a `` hot skin '' on top of the accretion disk .",
    "such a hot layer could not be heated by x ",
    "ray irradiation ( as postulated for the low / hard state ) , but it would require enhanced viscous energy dissipation compared to the bulk of the disk .",
    "the second possibility is that the electron energy distribution in the comptonizing plasma is a hybrid , thermal  non - thermal one , rather than a pure thermal ( maxwellian ) distribution .",
    "in fact , the compps model ( j. poutanen , private communication ) using the hybrid distribution gives very good fits to the hs and is data sets : @xmath14 for is , @xmath15 for hs , but it fails for vhs .",
    "shortly before reaching the peak of outburst nova muscae 1991 showed flip - flop transitions @xcite : the flux in the 220 kev band changed by @xmath16 .",
    "spectral and timing analysis during this period suggests that the source were undergoing re - structuring of the inner accretion disk .",
    "energy spectra both in the high- and low - flux state can be adequately described by the diskbb + thcomp + rel - repr models ( no additional comptonization of the soft component is required ) .",
    "the best - fit model spectra differ most at energies 510 kev : the differences are small both at the lowest and highest energies ( fig .  [ zycki_tiii-06:fig2 ] ) .",
    "the difference spectrum can be described as comptonization of single blackbody emission , but it can not be described as comptonized _ disk _ blackbody .",
    "x  ray power density spectra show both energy and flux dependence . the soft x",
    " rays ( @xmath17 kev ) pds is very different in the two flux states ( fig .",
    "[ zycki_tiii-06:fig2 ] ) . in the high flux state",
    "the pds resembles that of typical hs , i.e.  a power law @xmath18 with @xmath19 , although there is also a narrow qpo at @xmath20 hz .",
    "however , in the low flux state the psd has a lorenzian shape peaking ( in the @xmath21 representation ) at @xmath22 hz .",
    "the pds of the hard x  ray component ( @xmath23 kev ) is similar in both flux states except for the qpo energy which is higher in the low flux state .",
    "interactions between accretion disk and corona in the soft spectral states of accreting black holes are clearly complex .",
    "one outcome of those interactions is a presence of warm , mildly optically thick plasma modifying the disk thermal emission .",
    "proper modeling of the resulting spectra is important e.g.  for correct determination of system parameters .",
    "the flip - flop transitions observed in vhs of gs  1124 - 68 close to the peak of its outburst suggest that the optically thick accretion flow can proceed in two modes giving the same time - integrated characteristics .",
    "one mode , usually observed in hs , shows the @xmath24-like pds , i.e.  a scale - invariant behaviour , perhaps realized in magnetic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the other mode clearly possesses certain spatial / temporal scale , since the pds is described by a lorenzian , i.e.  it corresponds to exponential shots of a single time scale ."
