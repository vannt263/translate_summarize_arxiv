    "the quantum walk ( qw ) has been studied as a natural generalization of the classical random walk in relation with quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the possibility that future quantum algorithms will be based on the qw has attracted the attention of researchers from different fields .",
    "this topic is a matter of continuous attention , as an example it has been recently suggested by childs childs that qw can be regarded as a universal quantum computation .",
    "some possible experimental implementations of the qw have been proposed by a number of authors @xcite , beyond them , the fact remains that the development of experimental techniques to trap samples of atoms using resonant exchanges of momentum and energy between atoms and laser light @xcite may provide a realistic frame to implement quantum computers @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking properties of the one - dimensional qw is its ability to spread over the line linearly in time as characterized by the standard deviation @xmath0 , while its classical analog spreads out as the square root of time @xmath1 .",
    "several authors have studied the qw subjected to different types of coin operators and/or sources of decoherence to analyze and verify the principles of quantum theory as well as the passage from the quantum to the classical world . in ref . @xcite it was shown that the phases in the coin operator and the initial state of the coin can be used to control the evolution of the qw .",
    "the presence of decoherence in the qw has been studied as one possible route to classical behavior @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the appearance of a small decoherence can be used to enhance some properties of the qw in the development of quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "the qw subjected to multiple independent coins was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that this type of excitation can lead to a diffusive spreading instead of the ballistic one .",
    "the qw with a position dependent phase is studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where dynamical localization was found .",
    "a coin with explicit time - dependence is introduced for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , also finding dynamical localization and quasi - periodic dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite a non - linear dependence on the position - chirality probabilities is introduced in the evolution , finding a variety of dynamical behaviors , including ballistic motion and dynamical localization .",
    "the qw was also generalized @xcite introducing two coin operators arranged in quasi - periodic sequences following a fibonacci prescription , leading to a sub - ballistic wave function spreading , as shown by the power - law tail of the standard deviation [ @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "simultaneously , we studied the qw subjected to measurements @xcite and decoherence alejo2 with a lvy waiting - time distribution , finding that the system has also a sub - ballistic spreading .",
    "the appearance of this type of spreading shows the existence of a wealth of quantum behaviors that are not restricted to be diffusive ( decoherent ) or ballistic ( coherent ) .",
    "these are quantum coherent intermediate situations that could be useful to control quantum information .",
    "also , to drive the speed of the wave function spreading could be a tool for the development of quantum algorithms . in refs .",
    "@xcite some analytical results were obtained about sub - ballistic behavior in a stochastic frame , but they can not be extended to deterministic cases such as in ref . @xcite .",
    "then it remains to clarify how some deterministic sequences of the coin operator lead to a behavior that is neither diffusive nor ballistic .",
    "here we develop a simple qw model with a generalized coin , that allows an analytical treatment , to clarify the connection between the time evolution of the coin and the type of spreading of the system .",
    "we show how to select the sequences of the coin operator to obtain a predetermined power - law distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we develop the qw model with a time depended coin , in the third section numerical results are presented , in the last section we draw the conclusions , and in the appendix a we show the analytical deduction for the moments .",
    "the standard qw corresponds to a one - dimensional evolution of a quantum system ( the walker ) in a direction which depends on an additional degree of freedom , the chirality , with two possible states : left  @xmath4  or right  @xmath5 .",
    "the global hilbert space of the system is the tensor product @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hilbert space associated to the motion on the line and @xmath8 is the chirality hilbert space .",
    "let us call @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the operators in @xmath7 that move the walker one site to the left ( right ) , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 the chirality projector operators in @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the unitary transformations @xmath13where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the identity operator in @xmath7 , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are pauli matrices acting in @xmath8 .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath18 evolves the state in one time step @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "the wave vector can be expressed as the spinor @xmath21 |k\\rangle ,   \\label{spinor}\\]]where the upper ( lower ) component is associated to the left ( right ) chirality . the unitary evolution implied by eq.([ugen ] ) can be written as the map @xmath22      here we are generalizing the qw to the case where different quantum coins are applied .",
    "in particular we consider a deterministic angular time dependence @xmath23 for the coin operator .    in order to uncouple the chirality components in eqs.([mapa0],[mapa ] ) we consider two consecutive time steps and then the original map can be rearranged to obtain @xmath24@xmath25where @xmath26 .",
    "both components of the chirality satisfy the same equation , then in the following we shall work with @xmath27 only .",
    "we are interested in a time scale much larger than @xmath19 . then making a development around the time @xmath28 in eq.([eq1 ] ) and retaining the terms up to the first order in @xmath29 we have @xmath30 in order to make analytical calculations we shall restrict to a continuous coin function @xmath31 that satisfies the condition @xmath32 for @xmath33",
    ". then eq.([cuatro ] ) reduces to @xmath34we define now the effective dimensionless time @xmath35where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is chosen in such a way that starting from it , eq.([mapa2 ] ) reproduces correctly the asymptotic behavior of the original map eqs.([mapa0],[mapa ] ) .",
    "then @xmath37 is taken as the initial time of the process .",
    "changing to the variable @xmath38 eq.(mapa2 ) becomes @xmath39note that this is the recursion relation satisfied by the cylindrical bessel functions , thus the general solution of eq.([mapa3 ] ) , introducing the initial amplitudes @xmath40 , is @xmath41where @xmath42 is the @xmath43th order cylindrical bessel function . in a similar way , the solution for the same equation for @xmath44 is @xmath45with @xmath46 .",
    "the initial conditions of these equation are not necessarily the same as those used in the discrete map eqs.([mapa0 ] , [ mapa ] ) , because the approximation of a difference by a derivative does not hold for small times . in this context a long time",
    "implies many applications of the discrete map .",
    "the results eqs.([solua ] , [ solub ] ) , with appropriate initial conditions , provide a good asymptotic description for the dynamics of the discrete eqs.([mapa0 ] , [ mapa ] ) , as we shall see below .",
    "additionally eqs.([solua ] , [ solub ] ) show that the long - time propagation speed of the probability amplitudes is given by @xmath47 .",
    "the probability distribution for the walker s position at time @xmath48 is given by @xmath49that can be expressed as @xmath50we calculate the first and second moments of this distribution using the properties of the bessel functions ( see appendix a ) , obtaining : @xmath51 + m_{1}(0)\\text { , } \\label{mome0}\\]]@xmath52 \\right )   \\notag \\\\ & & -t^{\\ast } \\sum_{j=-\\infty } ^{\\infty } \\left ( 2j-1\\right ) \\re \\left [ a_{j}^{0}a_{j-1}^{0\\ast } + b_{j}^{0}b_{j-1}^{0\\ast } \\right ]   \\notag \\\\ & & + m_{2}(0)\\text { , }   \\label{mome}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath53 $ ] is the real part of @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the moments at time @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "note that , if we take symmetrical initial conditions , the first moment vanishes due to the the symmetrical dependence on the initial condition @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the standard deviation @xmath59 is @xmath60where @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 depend on the initial conditions . from eq.(sigma0 ) we conclude that if the effective time @xmath48 remains bounded for all @xmath28 , then the standard deviation remains bounded too . in this case",
    "the distribution does not spread and is therefore localized . on the other hand , when @xmath48 is unbounded @xmath65 increases with @xmath48 and the system diffuses .",
    "then , in the asymptotic regime , with @xmath48 unbounded , we substituted the eq .",
    "( [ sigma0 ] ) by the following equation @xmath66      among the alternatives for the time dependence of @xmath31 we study the case @xmath67where @xmath68 . substituting eq.([cos ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) and the resulting expression into eq.([sigma1 ] ) for @xmath69  and using the eq.([sigma0 ] ) for @xmath70 , one obtains @xmath71where we have introduced the discrete time dimensionless time @xmath72 through the definition @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the standard deviation , in the asymptotic limit @xmath75 , is given by @xmath76where we have omitted multiplicative constants .     as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath72 in log - log scales .",
    "the values of @xmath77 vary from @xmath78 ( top ) to @xmath79 ( bottom ) in steps of @xmath80 .",
    "the curves for the ballistic ( @xmath81 ) and the diffusive ( @xmath82 ) cases are shown in thick line to help visualization ]     ( in linear scale ) as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath72 ( in logarithmic scale ) .",
    "the upper curve for @xmath83 satisfies the law @xmath84 for large @xmath72 . the lower curve for @xmath85 oscillates around a constant value . ]     as a function of the dimensionless spatial position @xmath86 at time @xmath87 .",
    "the values of the parameter are , from top to bottom , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the scales for @xmath86 are different in each case ]    this result predicts five different types of asymptotic behaviors :    \\a ) ballistic for @xmath90 ,    \\b ) sub - ballistic for @xmath91 ,    \\c ) diffusive @xmath92    \\d ) sub - diffusive for @xmath93 ,    \\e ) localized for @xmath70 .",
    "the result for @xmath90 is to be expected because then the system reduces to the usual qw with a hadamard coin . in the other cases the system shows a variety of behaviors where the standard deviation has a slower growth .",
    "the most extreme of them arises for @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the system does not spread when @xmath33 and it maintains a localized position .",
    "it should be noted that when the derivative of the coin function satisfies @xmath94 for @xmath95 , eq.([mapa2 ] ) still correctly reproduces the asymptotic behavior of the original map .",
    "indeed , the approximation made to obtain eq.([mapa2 ] ) remains valid .",
    "in particular , if we take the linear time dependence @xmath96 , with @xmath97 irrational and @xmath98 , the present model gives similar results as those found in ref.@xcite .",
    "in order to verify the approximations made in our analytical treatment we shall compare the result of eq.([sigma ] ) with the numerical evaluation using eqs.([mapa0 ] , [ mapa ] ) .",
    "we take as initial conditions a walker starting from the central position @xmath99 with chirality @xmath100 ^{t}$ ] ; this choice produces a symmetrical evolution as in the usual qw .",
    "we then calculate the standard deviation @xmath101 using the original map .",
    "the results for @xmath102 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where for large @xmath72 ( @xmath103 ) the curves have no perceptible difference with @xmath104 .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the upper curve , that corresponds to the standard deviation for @xmath105 , shows some quick oscillations governed by an average logarithmic evolution as was numerically checked for large times .",
    "the lower curve , for @xmath106 , shows that the standard deviation oscillates around a constant value .",
    "then in both cases the average behavior agrees with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the profiles of the distribution @xmath107 for several values of @xmath102 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] at the same time @xmath108 . for @xmath109 the known qw profile for the hadamard coin is obtained . in this case",
    "the function spreads with its greatest speed arriving up to the positions @xmath110 . for",
    "larger values of @xmath102 the spreading speed decreases , the distribution shrinks and the two extreme peaks of the distribution come closer .",
    "when @xmath111 the standard deviation spreads out as @xmath112 , but the probability distribution @xmath107 is not gaussian , it has the same characteristics as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for @xmath113 .",
    "this confirms that the evolution corresponds to a coherent unitary process and not to the classical random walk . in the extreme case",
    "when @xmath114 the distribution is restricted to small values around its initial value and the two extreme peaks have melt in a very narrow peak .",
    "we conclude that in all cases the asymptotic behaviors have an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "in the usual qw the standard deviation has a linear growth , however using a biased quantum coin arranged in aperiodic sequence a sub - ballistic behavior is obtained @xcite .",
    "here we generalize the discrete qw using a time dependent unitary coin operator .",
    "we find an analytical expression for the dependence of the standard deviation on the coin operator in the asymptotic regime .",
    "this expression shows explicitly how to select the unitary evolution to obtain a predetermined asymptotic behavior for the wave function spreading : ballistic , sub - ballistic , diffusive , sub - diffusive or localized .",
    "the parameter @xmath115 of eq.([cos ] ) determines the degree of diffusivity of the system for large times .",
    "this feature opens interesting possibilities for quantum information processing because it could be used for controlling the spreading of the wave function .",
    "finally another point worth mentioning is that the asymptotic differential eq.([mapa3 ] ) has the same form that the differential equation for the amplitudes of the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) in resonance @xcite .",
    "the similitude between the qw and the qkr in resonance , suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , has been recently extended to the anomalous diffusion behavior presented in this work @xcite .",
    "therefore , as the qkr has been realized experimentally @xcite and the quantum resonances have already been observed @xcite , our results for the qw could be experimentally confirmed through an implementation of the qkr in resonance .",
    "the first and second moments of the distribution @xmath116 are @xmath117substituting eq.([prob1 ] ) into these equations we have@xmath118where @xmath119with the change of indexes @xmath120 and @xmath121 , these equations become @xmath122 in the above equations , three different type of sums are involved .",
