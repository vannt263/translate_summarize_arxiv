    "more than two decades of multi - wavelength observations and theoretical studies have led to a generally accepted unification scheme for agns . according to this scheme",
    ", all agns share some basic ingredients : 1 ) a supermassive black hole ; 2 ) an accretion disk coupled with a hot corona , which radiates from the optical through x - ray energies ; 3 ) high velocity and high density gas located at @xmath0 pc scales , usually referred to as broad - line region ( blr ) , since its radiation is dominated by broad ( fwhm@xmath0 200010,000 km @xmath1 ) permitted lines ; 4 ) lower velocity and low density gas located at @xmath0 kpc scales , referred to as narrow - line region ( nlr ) , and emitting narrow ( fwhm@xmath2 1000 km @xmath1 ) forbidden and permitted lines .",
    "a gaseous and molecular torus on pc scales presumably obscures the inner engine and the blr when viewed edge - on .",
    "in addition , in @xmath0 10% of agns , there are relativistic jets extending from kpc up to mpc scales . within this scheme ,",
    "several observational differences in the broad - band and line spectral properties between type 1 ( objects with broad permitted lines ) and type 2 agns ( with narrow lines only ; see @xcite ) are explained by orientation effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although observations generally support orientation - based unification models for agns , exceptions do exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , only about 50% of the brightest seyfert 2s show the presence of hidden broad line regions ( hblrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in their polarized optical spectra .",
    "several studies suggest that the presence or absence of hblrs depends on the agn luminosity , with hblr sources having larger optical luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the theoretical view point",
    ", @xcite hypothesized that the absence of hblrs corresponds to low values for accretion rate onto the central black hole .",
    "similar conclusions are reached by @xcite in the context of the disk - wind scenario for low accretion rate agns .",
    "further support for the existence of agns lacking a blr was put forward by @xcite , who reported the discovery of six naked agns  a new class of agns characterized by the absence of the broad line region accompanied by strong continuum emission and strong variability in the optical band .",
    "this result is based on a large - scale monitoring program carried out in different optical bands over the last 25 years , and on the spectroscopic follow - up ( see @xcite and references therein for a more detailed description of the optical observations ) .",
    "it must be outlined that , although the unification models are able to explain most of the agn observational properties , they do not offer any insight into the physical origin of the basic agn ingredients , namely the blr , the nlr , accretion flow , and the torus .",
    "detailed investigations of agns without blr have the potential of shedding some light on the physical mechanisms that lead to the suppression ( and possibly also to the formation ) of the blr .",
    "in addition , in the framework of clumpy torus models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , there is growing evidence that the torus and the blr are not separate entities .",
    "therefore , the study of naked agns may provide useful constraints also on the formation mechanism and nature of the torus .",
    "finally , if indeed naked agns lack blr and strong intrinsic absorption , they offer the best opportunity to investigate the accretion flow .",
    "an additional ( and perhaps the most important ) reason is that agns without blr might be representative of a large class of agns and thus a detailed study of the naked agns is critical .",
    "indeed , recent studies of @xcite , based on chandra deep field data , indicate that a sizable fraction of the local agn population is without bls and in fact represents the dominant agn class for x - ray luminosities below @xmath3 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the findings of several recent studies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that suggest that agns without blr or with weak optical lines are associated not only with low - luminosity agns but also with relatively bright agns .",
    "one of the most effective ways to investigate the properties of agns is with x - ray observations , since x - rays are produced and reprocessed in the inner , hottest nuclear regions of the source , and their penetrating power allows them to carry information from the central engine without being substantially affected by absorption , and to probe the presence of the putative torus .",
    "recently , we carried out a preliminary x - ray study of three naked agns ( q2122 - 444 , q2130 - 431 , q2131 - 427 ) with  snapshot observations that were performed in december 2005 .",
    "the most relevant results from the  study are reported in @xcite and can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the three agns are easily detected in x - rays and appear to be point - like at the sub - arcsecond resolution of .",
    "( 2 ) their x - ray spectral properties are consistent with those of seyfert 1 galaxies , with typical photon indices of @xmath01.8 and without strong intrinsic absorption ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the three sources are fairly bright in the x - rays with values comparable with those observed in seyfert 1 galaxies and larger than typical seyfert 2 luminosities @xcite , and have eddington ratios ranging between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "more recently , q2131 - 427 and q2130 - 431 , two of the original naked agns detected by @xcite , have been observed quasi - simultaneously in the x - rays with  and in the optical band with the ntt by @xcite .",
    "the high - quality optical spectroscopic data confirmed the  naked \" nature of q2131 - 427 but revealed weak broad lines for q2130 - 431 . on one hand ,",
    "these results combined with the lack of intrinsic absorption inferred from  led @xcite to the conclusion that q2131 - 427 is a  true \" type 2 agn and q2130 - 431 might be a  true \" intermediate seyfert with an intrinsically weak blr . on the other hand , the detection of broad lines in the optical spectrum of q2130 - 431 casts some doubts on the optical classification of the original sample of @xcite , since it is based on relatively low - sensitivity optical spectral data .",
    "here we investigate the nature of the central engine in   ( ra@xmath7 , dec@xmath8 , @xmath9=0.311 ) , another putative naked agn from the sample of @xcite . to this end",
    "we make use of  epic and om data ( described in section 3 ) to shed light on the energetics of this enigmatic agn . the  analysis is complemented with the investigation of new optical spectroscopic data recently obtained from the ntt / efosc2 to robustly verify the claim that  lacks a blr ( see sect .",
    "we also use radio data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to assess whether the peculiar properties of this source can be explained by the presence of a jet .",
    "the description of all the observations and the data reduction is provided in section 2 .",
    "the main results and their implications are discussed in section 5 , while the main conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "was observed by  from november 18 , 2007 , 22:38 ut to november 19 , 2007 , 10:22 ut .",
    "the epic pn and mos cameras were operated in full - frame mode with a thin filter .",
    "the data were processed using the latest ccd gain values . for the temporal and spectral analysis ,",
    "events corresponding to pattern 012 ( singles , doubles , triples , and quadruples ) in the mos cameras and 04 ( singles and doubles only , since the pn pixels are larger ) in the pn camera were accepted .",
    "arf and rmf files were created with the  science analysis software ( ` sas ` ) 8.0 .",
    "the recorded events were screened to remove known hot pixels and data affected by periods of flaring background .",
    "the resulting effective total exposures are 34 ks for the epic pn and 41 ks for both mos cameras .",
    "the extraction radius used for the source spectra and light curves is 30 .",
    "background spectra and light curves were extracted from source - free circular regions of 60  extraction radius on the same chip as the source .",
    "there are no signs of pile - up in the pn or mos cameras according to the sas task epatplot .",
    "the rgs data have signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath10 ) that is too low for a meaningful analysis .",
    "the x - ray spectral analysis was performed using the xspec v.12.4.0 software package @xcite .",
    "the epic data have been re - binned in order to contain at least 20 counts per channel for the @xmath11 statistic to be valid .",
    "the errors on spectral parameters are at 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the data from the om @xcite were processed with the latest calibration files using the sas task omichain , which provides count rates in the b , u , uvw1 , and uvm2 bands .",
    "the count rates were then converted into magnitudes using the formula @xmath13 ( where the zero - points are 19.266 , 18.259 , 17.204 , and 15.772 , for the b , u , uvw1 , and uvm2 bands , respectively ) and corrected for systematics .",
    "the values were corrected for extinction ( see sect 3.3 for more details ) and converted to fluxes by using standard formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the optical spectroscopic data of  were retrieved from the eso archive .  was observed with eso faint object spectrograph and camera v.2 ( efosc2 ) at the new technology telescope ( ntt ) in la silla ( chile ) on 2009 , july 6th with grating # 13 and a 1-arcsec slit width which corresponds to a wavelength resolution of 21.2   ( fwhm ) , in the range 3900 - 9200  .",
    "three spectra with exposure time of 600s each were acquired ( air mass @xmath0 1.08 ) .",
    "a standard reduction process was applied using midas and iraf tasks .",
    "the raw data were bias subtracted , cleaned from cosmic rays and corrected for pixel - to - pixel variations ( flat - field ) .",
    "object spectra were extracted and sky subtracted . eventually the three spectra were averaged to obtain a single higher s / n spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibrations were carried out by comparison with exposures of he and ar lamps , with an accuracy @xmath2 15  .",
    "relative flux calibration was carried out by observations of several spectrophotometric standard stars ( oke 1990 ) .",
    "we used the atca in the 6a configuration for imaging   at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz .",
    "the beam size at 8.6 ghz is 1.3@xmath140.8  with a position angle of 78.9@xmath15 . at 4.8 ghz",
    "the beam size is 2.2@xmath141.4  with a position angle of 58.9@xmath15 .",
    "typically the positional accuracy may be affected by pointing stability of the array",
    ". however , the pointing deviations are usually below 1 arcsec even for the snapshot observations .",
    "the source was observed in three sessions over the period between 20 and 22 jan 2008 . in each session",
    "we obtained six 10-minutes scans with 1 second integration time at each frequency , which were interleaved with the observations of the point source phase calibrator , pks 2106 - 413 .",
    "the flux density calibration was achieved with the atca primary calibrator , pks 1934 - 638 .",
    "the final images of the 30 ( 15 ) arcsec area for 4.8 ( 8.6 ) ghz around the optical position of the source show no detection of radio emission above the 0.78 mjy noise level limit ( which is the 3 sigma flux limit ) .",
    "we studied the short - term variability of  using epic pn data with time - bins of 2000 s. figure  [ figure : fig1 ] shows the epic time series of the 0.3 - 10 kev band ( top panel ) and of the hardness ratio @xmath162 - 10 kev/0.3 - 2 kev ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a visual inspection of fig .  [ figure : fig1 ] suggests that low - amplitude flux changes might be present in the light curve without being accompanied by spectral variations .",
    "a formal analysis based on a @xmath11 test indicates that there is no significant temporal ( @xmath17 ) or spectral ( @xmath18 ) variability on short timescales .",
    "since  has also been observed by  in december 2005 , it is possible to investigate the presence of long - term flux variations . over a period of nearly two years the 210 kev flux of  decreased by a factor of @xmath02 ( from @xmath19  measured during the  snapshot survey to @xmath20  measured by ) .",
    "interestingly , this significant change of x - ray flux appears to be accompanied by a moderate spectral variability : the hardness ratio of  increases from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "this suggests that  follows the typical spectral variability trend observed in seyfert 1 galaxies , with a steeper x - ray spectrum when the source is brighter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unlike the  spectral analysis that was severely hampered by poor photon statistics due to the brevity of the observation , the longer  exposure coupled with its high throughput makes it possible to study the x - ray spectral properties of  in greater detail .",
    "however , similar to the  acis spectrum , the combined spectra of the three epic cameras are adequately fitted by a simple power law modified by absorption that is left free to vary ( @xmath23 ; 112 d.o.f ) .",
    "the best - fit values of the relevant spectral parameters are : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "similar values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are obtained when the column density is fixed at the galactic value @xmath28 .",
    "the spectra and residuals of q2122 - 444 are shown in figure  [ figure : fig2 ] , while figure  [ figure : fig3 ] shows the confidence contours of @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is instructive to compare these results with the corresponding ones obtained with the  snapshots ( see figs . 2 and 3 from @xcite ) .",
    "although the parameters from the  analysis are more tightly constrained , the basic conclusions remain the same : the photon index is consistent with typical values measured in seyfert 1 galaxies and , more importantly , there is no evidence for intrinsic absorption ( the 90% confidence contours are fully consistent with the galactic value , @xmath30 ) .",
    "although the epic cameras have a larger effective area above 6 kev with respect to the  acis camera , the limited statistics of the  spectrum of  does not allow a detailed investigation of the  line .",
    "the line energy and width remain unconstrained when they are left free to vary , therefore we fixed them at @xmath31 kev and @xmath32=0.01 kev , respectively .",
    "the model comprising a  line in addition to the absorbed power law does not lead to any statistically significant improvement of the fit ( @xmath33 for one additional parameter ) indicating that a line is not required .",
    "the equivalent width of this line is 640 ev with a 90% upper limit of @xmath01 kev .",
    "since the x - ray emission is likely to be produced by the comptonization of seed photons emitted by the underlying accretion disk , it is appropriate and physically more motivated to use a comptonization model instead of a phenomenological model like the power law .",
    "using a general comptonization model , the bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ; @xcite ) , yields a fit ( @xmath34 ; 110 d.o.f ) which is statistically indistinguishable from the power law fit , with parameters that are fairly typical for agns .",
    "specifically , we obtain @xmath35 kev ( the temperature of the seed photons ) , @xmath36 ( the spectral index , which is related to the photon index by @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 ( which is related to the comptonization fraction @xmath39 by the relation @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is the ratio of compton scattered photons over the seed photons ) , and the normalization @xmath41 , which is in units of @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the luminosity and distance of the object , respectively .",
    "the use of the bmc model is the first step necessary to constrain the black hole mass in .",
    "the estimate @xmath45 is obtained from the x - ray spectral results of the bmc model by making use of a scaling technique recently introduced for galactic black holes by @xcite and extended to agns by @xcite .",
    "this procedure is described in section 5 .",
    "the simultaneous use of several cameras and telescopes on board of  is one of the most beneficial capability of this satellite .",
    "this property not only makes it possible to increase the s / n in the x - ray band by combining the data of the three epic cameras , but thanks to the om it also offers the simultaneous coverage of the optical and uv bands , which is crucial to understand the energetics of agns .    during the  pointing in november 2007 , the om detected  in the b ( 4400  ) , u ( 3440  ) , and uvw1 ( 2910  ) bands , whereas the source was not detected with the uvw2 ( 2120  ) filter .",
    "the observed magnitudes are respectively : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "since there is no general consensus on the extinction corrections that need to be applied in the optical - uv band , we have tried different extinction curves , including the galactic extinction proposed by @xcite and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) type extinction @xcite , which proved to work well on a large sample of agns from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite . for completeness , we also applied extinction corrections derived from the x - ray spectral fits by converting @xmath29 into optical extinction with the relation @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the results from the different extinction laws are consistent with each other within 10% .",
    "one of the most widely used quantities to parametrize the broadband properties of agns is the the spectral index , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we derive @xmath51 , from the simultaneous x - ray and uv ( uvw1 filter ) fluxes , assuming a typical uv slope of 0.7 ( @xmath52 and the extinction prescriptions discussed above . in section 5 we discuss the implications of this result in the context of type 1 agns .",
    "in figure  [ figure : opt ] we show the efosc2 optical spectrum of .",
    "the line intensities and widths were measured by fitting gaussian profiles and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) calculated taking into account the spectrograph resolution .",
    "the results from the spectral fitting of the relevant lines are shown in table  [ table = opt_spec ] .",
    "the presence of strong broad balmer lines clearly points to a reclassification of as a type 1 seyfert galaxy .",
    "hawkins ( 2004 ) measured a fwhm of 351 km / s and 699 km / s for the h@xmath53 and @xmath54}$ ] emission lines respectively ( the h@xmath55 line was out of the covered spectral range ) and classified this source as a type 2 agn .",
    "a possible explanation for the mis - match between the two optical classifications is that the h@xmath56 broad component may have been obscured by a nearby absorber at the time of the hawkins observation , in agreement with the findings of @xcite that demonstrate that variations of the local absorber can occur on short timescales and change the appearance of the central engine .",
    "in addition , it must be pointed out that hawkins optical spectroscopy was performed with a 2df multi - fibre spectrograph at the aat which can not guarantee high s / n ratio spectra because of difficulties in subtracting the sky background ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this problem is more severe for relatively faint objects like .    [ table = opt_spec ]",
    "the primary goal of our original  project was to shed light on the nature of , a member of the enigmatic class of naked agns that allegedly lack a blr based on their unusual combination of spectral and temporal properties in the optical band @xcite .",
    "the high - quality spectroscopic data presented in the previous section revealed the presence of strong broad lines in the optical spectrum of , ruling out its naked nature .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to investigate the energetics of .      before discussing the energetics of",
    ", it is important to establish whether a relativistic jet is present in this system and if its energetic contribution is important beyond the radio band .",
    "the original reason to look for a jet in  was that it represents the simplest solution to explain the unusual combination of spectral and temporal properties shown by  in the optical band . in this scenario ,",
    "the jet not only may produce the observed large - amplitude variability of the continuum but it can also contribute to the non - detection of broad optical lines through dilution . additionally , the blr emission could be partially obscured by a local absorber .",
    "however , the ntt / efosc2 optical spectroscopy has revealed that a blr is indeed present in  and the x - ray spectral analysis has confirmed the lack of relevant intrinsic absorption .",
    "nevertheless it is instructive to investigate the radio properties of this source to test the contribution of a putative jet .",
    "the lack of radio detection in the atca observations leads to a 3 @xmath32 upper limit of 0.78 mjy for the radio flux of .",
    "this value combined with the flux measurements in the optical and x - ray bands yields low upper limits for the different radio - loudness parameters defined in the literature .",
    "for example , using the standard definition of radio loudness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we get @xmath57 , which is well below the threshold @xmath58 that is traditionally used to divide radio - quiet from radio - loud agns . note however that @xmath58 does not represent a reliable boundary between radio loud ( rl ) and radio quiet ( rq ) agns @xcite",
    ". a more reliable conclusion can be derived by using @xmath59 , which was introduced by @xcite to avoid extinction problems , and exploiting the results of @xcite , who carried out a detailed investigation of the radio loudness in two large samples of radio - quiet seyfert galaxies and low - luminosity radio galaxies ( llrgs ) and derived a rl / rq threshold of @xmath60 .",
    "the upper limit obtained for , @xmath61 , indicates that this source is fully consistent with radio - quiet seyfert galaxies and inconsistent with radio - loud objects ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) . since we have inferred that either a jet is absent in  or its contribution is completely negligible , for the remainder of the paper we can safely assume that the broadband emission is associated with the accretion flow only .",
    "the first necessary step to investigate the central engine in agns is to constrain the mass of the supermassive black hole . as with many agns for which there are no direct measurements from reverberation mapping",
    ", a bh mass of @xmath62 @xcite was determined using the virial theorem and fwhm([o iii ] ) , which however was proven to be not a very robust indicator of the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the broad balmer lines detected in the efosc2 spectrum in combination with the simultaneously measured flux at 5100  , @xmath63  @xmath64 , allows a more reliable estimate of @xmath45 . plugging the value of fwhm(h@xmath55 ) in the virial formula and using the relation between the broad line region radius and the 5100   luminosity from @xcite to determine @xmath65 , we derive @xmath66 , where a 20% error was conservatively adopted to account for the uncertainties associated with this method .",
    "slightly larger values are obtained when using fwhm(h@xmath56 ) and fwhm(h@xmath67 ) instead of fwhm(h@xmath55 ) : @xmath68 .    an alternative way to constrain the @xmath45 of",
    "is based on the analogy between agns and galactic black holes ( gbhs ) . there is now mounting evidence that agns may be considered as large - scale analogs of gbhs ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the large difference in scales , both gbhs and agns are believed to harbor the same central engine : a black hole and an accretion disk / corona that sometimes produces a relativistic jet .",
    "it is also generally accepted that the bulk of the x - ray emission in any black hole system , irrespective of their mass , is produced by the comptonization process , although some controversy still exists about the origin of x - rays during the low - hard state in gbhs @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered that gbhs during their spectral transition between low - hard to high - soft state present a universal scalable relationship between the photon index @xmath26 and the normalization of the bmc model @xmath69 , and that the @xmath70 relationship can be used to estimate the mass of any gbhs .",
    "the physical basis of these scaling techniques is thoroughly explained by @xcite and essentially relies on the fact that the bmc normalization is a function of luminosity and distance ( @xmath71 ) and that the luminosity of a black hole system can be expressed as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath74 the accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "the self - similarity of the @xmath69 - @xmath26 correlation shown by gbhs implies that , in the same spectral state , different sources have similar values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and the photon index is a reliable indicator for the source s spectral state .    since the comptonization process producing the x - ray emission appears to be ubiquitous in black holes systems , and since there is evidence that the photon index is positively correlated with the accretion rate also in agns ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in principle , the same method may be applied to estimate the mass of supermassive black holes .",
    "we have recently used this method to constrain @xmath45 in the particular case of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy pks 0558 - 504 ( see @xcite for details ) and we are in the process of testing the extension of this method to smbhs in general by applying it to a sizable sample of agns with masses determined via reverberation mapping ( gliozzi et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the basics steps of this scaling method can be summarized as follows : + 1 ) construct a @xmath75 plot for a gbh of known mass and distance , which will be used as reference ( hereafter denoted by the subscript _",
    "+ 2 ) compute the normalization ratio between the target of interest ( that is denoted by the subscript _ t _ ) and the reference object @xmath76 at the value of @xmath26 measured for the target .",

    "the values of @xmath45 obtained with this new method , which is independent of optical measurements and of any assumption on the blr , appear to be in broad agreement with the values derived from the virial theorem .",
    "although this consistency is encouraging , the robustness of the gbh scaling method needs to be quantitatively assessed using a large sample of agns .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of the paper we will utilize the value determined from the h@xmath55 line and the virial theorem , @xmath95 this corresponds to an eddington luminosity of @xmath96 .      in order to shed some light on the energetics",

    "first , by using their equation 6 , which provides the relationship between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and equation 9 , which describes the correlation between @xmath99 and @xmath97 , we can quantitatively verify whether the uv - to - x - ray properties of  are consistent with the those observed in  standard \" type 1 agns . by plugging the value of @xmath98 measured by the om into equation 6 of @xcite",

    "the lack of detection of any radio emission and the consequent low value of the upper limit of the radio loudness implies that a relativistic jet ( postulated to explain the long - term optical variability observed for over two decades in ) is unlikely to be present and certainly does not play a relevant role in the energetics of this agn . *",
    "a temporal x - ray analysis indicates that  remains constant in the 0.310 kev energy band on timescales of a few ks . on the other hand , a comparison with a  observation carried out nearly two years before the  pointing reveals the presence of significant flux variability accompanied by moderate spectral variability .",
