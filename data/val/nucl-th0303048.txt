    "quasi - elastic inclusive and exclusive high energy electron scattering off nuclei of the type @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc , where @xmath8 denotes a hadron , represent powerful tools to investigate both the properties of hadronic matter , as well as basic qcd predictions , provided one is able to evaluate the effects of the final state interaction ( fsi ) of the lepto - produced hadrons . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the possibilities to get information on basic properties of bound hadrons , such as , for example their momentum and energy distributions , crucially depend upon the ability to estimate to which extent fsi effects destroy the direct link between the measured cross section and the hadronic properties before interaction with the probe , so the main aim is to minimize the effects of fsi . at the same time",
    ", the necessity for an accurate treatment of fsi , stems from the qcd prediction that at large @xmath4 fsi should vanish because of color transparency ( ct ) @xcite- @xcite ( for recent reviews on the subject , see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) , according to which the rescattering amplitudes of the hit nucleon ( the _ ejectile _ ) corresponding to various excited states interfere destructively .",
    "this is equivalent to the gribov inelastic corrections @xcite to the glauber multiple scattering approximation .",
    "thus the experimental investigation of ct is thought to be the detection of possible differences between experimental data and predictions of standard glauber multiple scattering calculations of fsi . while there is a vast consensus on the qualitative features of the effect , the quantitative aspects are still under debate and many details in the theoretical formulation of the problem are not unique .",
    "most problems arise for the following reason : whereas the glauber approach is a workable and reliable approximation to the scattering of hadrons off nuclei , problems may arise when one is treating the rescattering of a hadron produced in the medium .",
    "therefore one faces both the problem of calculating the usual rescattering of the produced hadron and the introduction of ct effects . the standard approach to ct",
    "is formulated in terms of a multi - channel problem , the vanishing of fsi taking place via the cancellation between contributions from channels with various excitations of the nucleon .",
    "this cancellation is expected to become fully operative in a high energy regime , when , at least , several nucleon states are excited . where precisely such a regime is located is not yet quite clear .",
    "present evidence from experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations of quasi - elastic @xmath9 reactions seems to indicate that ct effects are not visible up to @xmath4 of the order 20 ( gev / c)@xmath10 .",
    "the treatment of ct within the multi - channel glauber approach inevitably involves many poorly known quantities , related both to the structure of the tower of excited nucleon states and to diagonal and non - diagonal amplitudes for their rescattering .",
    "it also usually leads to rather heavy expressions for numerical evaluation .",
    "this makes the predictions of various approaches not unique and sometimes even conflicting . a formally different , though physically equivalent",
    "approach for the treatment of fsi in lepto - production processes has been recently developed @xcite , based upon a direct evaluation of feynman diagrams and assuming an explicit dependence of the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude on the virtuality of the ejectile ; by this way one introduces a finite formation time ( fft ) for the produced hadronic state to become a physical hadron . in this approach , which , for a single rescattering is equivalent to the ct in a two - channel approach , fsi vanish because with increasing @xmath4 the virtuality also increases and the amplitudes diminish .",
    "the approach has been applied to the inclusive process @xmath6 at the value of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we generalize the approach to @xmath1 and to exclusive processes @xmath12 for which a large wealth of papers , aimed at investigating ct effects , already exists at @xmath0 , where the energy in the final state is sufficiently high to produce physical nucleon resonant states .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate ct ( fft ) effects also at @xmath13 , i.e. in the so called _ cumulative _ region .",
    "we will present here the results for the deuteron , leaving a discussion for complex nuclei for subsequent paper .",
    "the cumulative region has not been much investigated in the past on the basis of the conjecture that the influence of ct should be much smaller than at @xmath14 , since the available final state energy may be insufficient to produce those excited states of the hit nucleon , whose contribution is to cancel the one coming from the lowest scattering states .",
    "nonetheless the importance of the investigation of ct effects in the cumulative region has been stressed ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that , due to the different role played by the fermi motion , ct effects should strongly depend upon the value of @xmath2 , so that such a dependence should represent a possible signature of ct .",
    "such a conclusion , which is certainly well - grounded , was however based on the glauber picture for the rescattering , in which the hit nucleon which rescatters with the other @xmath15 particles ( the _ ejectile _ ) is taken on its mass shell during rescattering . in reality",
    "the ejectile may also rescatter in a virtual state , below the energy necessary for it physical excitation .",
    "thus only a part of the rescattering contribution vanishes at low energies , namely that coming from the imaginary part of the ejectile propagator , whereas the one coming from the real part does not vanish and may feel the influence of excited ejectile states created virtually .",
    "obviously this effect can be felt only if one goes beyond the glauber approximation for the rescattering .",
    "we have investigated this problem by a direct calculation of rescattering contribution in the cumulative region starting from the relevant feynman diagrams . it should be stressed here that a rigorous relativistic description in the cumulative region encounters difficulties of principle already at the level of the impulse approximation ; these difficulties are mainly related to the treatment of the unknown electromagnetic form - factors for an off - mass - shell nucleon , so that the calculation of the rescattering and fft contribution with relativistic spins is out of the question with the present calculational possibilities .",
    "one has therefore to recur to some approximations to make calculations viable . in our approach",
    ", we calculate the amplitudes in a relativistic manner treating , however , the deuteron and the nucleons as spinless particles ; the approximation is cured by introducing an effective electromagnetic form - factor of the nucleon suitably chosen to take into account the magnetic moments",
    ". we will demonstrate that at the level of the ia such a procedure provides results in a very good agreement with calculations performed within a full treatment of spin @xcite , which makes us confident that the rescattering and fft contributions calculated with these effective form - factors represents a meaningful approximation .",
    "since we are assuming a quasi - elastic mechanism of @xmath16 interaction with a bound nucleon , thanks to the high cumulativity @xmath17 of the process , the invariant mass of the final hadronic state does not strongly differ from the nucleon mass , so that one can simply use elastic rescattering amplitudes for the rescattering contribution .",
    "most important , in this region the pole contributions responsible for the fft , do not contribute at all and all the fft effect originates from the non - glauber contribution due to the real part of the ejectile propagator .",
    "so we shall be able to study directly the importance of this effect neglected in previous treatments of ct effects .",
    "our results show that the relative weight of the rescattering contribution steadily grows with @xmath1 reaching 50% already at @xmath18 .",
    "the ct or fft effects , indeed very small at @xmath19 , become quite pronounced at larger @xmath2 .",
    "so , contrary to usual expectations , the study of rescattering on the deuteron allows to see these effects quite clearly .",
    "as already mentioned , our numerical results are obtained in a relativistic approach ; the approach based on the glauber picture with relativistic kinematics exhibits no fft effects , as predicted in @xcite , but fails to reproduce the rescattering contribution above @xmath20 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the general formalism for treating inclusive and quasi - exclusive cross sections will be presented ; the impulse approximation will be described in section 3 whereas the rescattering and fft effects will be treated in section 4 .",
    "the numerical results are given in section 5 , conclusions are drawn in section 6 . in appendices",
    "a and b , several details concerning the numerical calculations are given .",
    "in the relativistic domain the nucleon struck by the virtual photon may be excited to states with higher masses . at very high energies",
    "this leads to the standard picture of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "we are interested in this paper in the quasi - elastic ( q.e . ) scattering , when the final produced hadronic state is just a nucleon . to achieve this and stay within the description in terms of nucleons , we choose the kinematical region of deep enough cumulativity , @xmath2 close to 2 , where the total mass of the final hadronic systems remains low , below the threshold for the formation of excited nucleon states .",
    "thus the process we are investigating is as follows    e+de+p+n [ process ]    and in our calculations we simply use elastic rescattering amplitudes for the rescattering inside the deuteron .",
    "we will consider both the inclusive process @xmath21 , when only the scattered electron is detected in the final state , as well as the exclusive process @xmath22 , when also the proton is detected in coincidence with the scattered electron .",
    "the main kinematical quantities involved in the process will be denoted as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the deuteron and nucleon masses , respectively ; 2 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the four - momenta of the incoming and scattered electrons , respectively ; 3 .",

    "we use light - cone coordinates , @xmath39 , @xmath40 defined in the usual way viz . @xmath41 .",
    "the independent variables for each nucleon @xmath42 are its transverse momentum component and the carried fraction of the momentum @xmath43 ( _ scaling variable _ ) : @xmath44 and @xmath45 before the interaction and @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the final state .",

    "since , as it will be shown later on , the exclusive cross section will be obtained by a proper procedure from the structure functions appearing in the definition of the inclusive cross section , some general relations concerning kinematics and structure functions relevant for both inclusive and exclusive processes will be derived , starting from the definition of the inclusive cross section . in terms of the standard structure functions @xmath52 ,",

    "one is left only with one non - trivial integration over @xmath74 , which has to be done numerically .",
    "this is a big advantage of the chosen system : in the theoretical system @xmath51 results @xmath31-dependent , so that one encounters two numerical integrations . for the impulse approximation",
    "this is still viable , but passing to rescattering the number of non - trivial integrations rises to five , which makes the theoretical system impractical .",
    "we will consider now the exclusive process ( [ process ] ) when the the fast nucleon with momentum @xmath96 is observed in coincidence with the scattered electron .",
    "as is well known , the hadronic tensor for the exclusive @xmath97 process has the following general form @xmath98    i.e. it depends upon four independent response functions @xmath99 instead of two appearing in inclusive scattering .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , it is impossible to obtain the exclusive cross section from the inclusive tensor ( [ inclutens ] ) .",
    "however , with all components of @xmath54 explicitly known in our case , it is easy to demonstrate that by fixing the intermediate nucleon scaling variable @xmath74 and dropping the integration over @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ sigia ] ) one obtains the correct exclusive cross - section integrated over the azimuthal angles of the final nucleons .",
    "of course if one desires to find the exclusive cross - section with a fully fixed momenta of both the final electron and nucleon , including their azimuthal directions , then one has to apply a different procedure using the explicit expression for the @xmath101 amplitude and a convenient kinematical system instead of representations like ( [ inclutens ] ) or ( [ semiincl ] ) .",
    "the rescattering amplitude , represented by the diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 , has the following form @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 denotes the rescattering amplitude ( in the relativistic normalization ) .",
    "the first problem one encounters in the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ resc ] ) , is the integration over the `` - '' components of the momenta ( light - cone `` energies '' ) .",
    "such an integration requires , in principle , the knowledge of the unknown dependence of both the vertices @xmath106 and the rescattering amplitude @xmath105 , upon the `` - '' components . in order to overcome such a principle difficulty",
    ", we make the approximation consisting of taking into account only the singularities coming from the nucleon propagators in eq .",
    "( [ resc ] ) . this can be justified if both the deuteron wave function and the rescattering amplitude are generated by an instantaneous interaction in the light - cone variables , in which case , however , the full relativistic invariance would be lost .",
    "our procedure is equivalent to restoring it by expressing the relativistically invariant arguments via the light - cone variables in the preferable system where the interaction was instantaneous .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the lab system with @xmath107 not equal to zero the integration over the `` - '' components of the momenta is more complicated than in the system where @xmath108 .",
    "let us choose @xmath109 as an integration variable in the left loop .",
    "the three denominators generate three poles in @xmath109 : where @xmath103 and all masses are supposed to have a small negative imaginary part .",
    "the position of the poles depends on the signs of the @xmath110 components .",
    "one has to take into account the following relations , which restrict possible signs of @xmath111 and @xmath112 : @xmath113 following from the fact that the @xmath110 component is positive for physical particles and negative for the photon .",
    "one sees immediately that if @xmath114 or @xmath115 all poles are on the same side of the real axis in the @xmath109 complex plane , so that the result of the integration will be zero .",
    "in fact if @xmath114 then both @xmath116 and @xmath112 have to be positive , and all the poles lie above the real axis .",
    "if @xmath115 , both @xmath116 and @xmath112 are negative and all the poles lie below the real axis .",
    "so , as in the system @xmath108 , we are left with the interval @xmath117 and consequently also @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the pole from the spectator nucleon will lie below the real axis , and the one from the active nucleon before the interaction above it .",
    "however in the lab system there are two different possibilities for the pole coming from the ejectile propagator : ( i ) if @xmath119 then @xmath120 and so @xmath121 .",
    "this is the situation which is always realized in the system @xmath108 , when the ejectile pole lies above the real axis and the total integral is given by the contribution of the residue at the spectator pole at @xmath122 , ( ii ) if @xmath123 and so @xmath124 then @xmath125 , the ejectile pole lies below the real axis , and the integral will then be given by the residue at the active nucleon pole @xmath126 .",
    "thus the result is different for different values of the scaling variables of the nucleons in the deuteron .",
    "note that in both regions the integrand , apart from the rescattering amplitude and the ejectile propagator , will be expressed via the light - cone function ( [ wfdeut ] ) with one of the nucleons on the mass shell . the invariant argument @xmath51",

    "> from general arguments , such a behaviour should be similar in the cumulative limit , since both are generated by the same interaction .",
    "in our calculations however we shall represent both behaviours via certain phenomenologically chosen functions .",
    "this can be justified up to certain limiting values of @xmath128 and @xmath51 below which these approximations are valid .",
    "however one is not allowed to come too close to the cumulative limit , where the mutual links between the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath82 and @xmath153 becomes crucial .",

    "( [ ti2 ] ) , when fft is taken into account , this vector contains two terms differing in the propagator of the ejectile .",
    "both terms are calculated in a similar manner , the only difference being the mass of the ejectile .",
    "some details of the numerical evaluation of @xmath154 are given in appendix b. the basic ingredients entering the definition of @xmath154 are the relativistic deuteron wave function @xmath82 , the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath105 , and the effective form factor @xmath78 appearing in the expression of the hadronic tensor . for the relativistic deuteron wave function @xmath82 ,",
    "we have taken a relativistic generalization of the non - relativistic function @xmath155 which corresponds to the @xmath156 interaction @xcite .",
    "its relation to @xmath82 was established from the non - relativistic limit ( see appendix a ) , obtaining : g^2(v)=2m(2)^3)|(*k*_1 ^ 2)|^2 [ gi ] with _ 1 ^ 2=(v - m ) [ kap ] as for the rescattering amplitude , it was chosen in the form a(s , t)=(+i)^tot(s)e^bt with the values of the parameters @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 taken from @xcite .",
    "the effective nuclear form - factor @xmath160 was chosen to take into account the magnetic interaction of realistic nucleons .",
    "a comparison of our impulse approximation results with the results obtained taking spin into accounts in the region of small cumulativity @xmath94 leads to the choice ^2(q^2)=_d^2(q^2 ) [ formfactor ] where _",
    "d(q^2)=(1+)^-2 is the dipole ( @xmath161)form - factor , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 are the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron .    to quantify the effects of the non - glauber nature of the relativistic rescattering we also repeated the calculations taking for the rescattering the glauber form .",
    "this involves two approximations :    1 .",
    "first , the longitudinal part of the momentum transfer in the rescattering is disregarded , which means that t=-(k_2-_2)_^2 2 .",
    "second , and most important in our case , the contribution from the real part of the virtual ejectile propagator is neglected , and only the full contribution from its pole is taken into account .    within the above approximations , evidently , fft effects vanish unless the rescattering energy becomes greater than the threshold for the production of the excited ejectile with mass @xmath164 .",
    "our energies lie below this threshold , so that within glauber rescattering we find no fft effects .",

    "( [ sigt ] ) , with @xmath166 given by eq .",
    "( [ jt ] ) .",
    "our numerical calculations have been performed in correspondence of the experimental data of @xcite with initial electron energy @xmath167 gev and scattering angle @xmath168 .",

    "some relevant kinematical values characterizing the chosen points are listed in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , that at high values of @xmath2 ( high cumulativity ) the value of @xmath170 , representing the momentum of the hit nucleon in the _ lab _ system of a second nucleon , is very small , well below the threshold energy for pion production .",

    "thus we are confident that the use of spinless particles with effective form factors to take into account rescattering and fft effects , is a significant one .",
    "the effects of rescattering and fft on the inclusive cross section are shown in figs . 5 and 6 ( from now - on , unless differently stated , @xmath171 is used to mean that _ both _ rescattering and fft effects are taken into account ) . in fig .",
    "5 we show the ratio of the cross section which includes @xmath171 to the @xmath172 cross section . it can be seen that that rescattering contributions , which are very small at @xmath94 ( corresponding to @xmath173 , cf .",
    "table 1 ) , steadily grows with @xmath2 , reaching an order of about 50% already at @xmath174 . in fig .",
    "6 and 7 the theoretical results are compared with the experimental data .",
    "it can be observed that , up to @xmath175 the the cross - section which includes rescattering effects is close to the experimental one at @xmath94 but becomes somewhat lower towards @xmath176 .",
    "up to @xmath177 the fft effects are negligible but starting from this value tend to substantially diminish the cross - section , whereas above @xmath176 the situation abruptly changes : the rescattering strongly enhances the cross - section , an effect which is common to all approaches which take into account fsi ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; the effect was found particularly relevant in finite nuclei and various phenomenological effects have been adopted to contrast rescattering effects ; from the results presented in fig . 5 , 6 and 7",
    ", it can be seen that fft effects , decreasing the cross section for an off - shell nucleon , lead precisely to the desired effect : when fft are considered , the cross section is again reduced toward the experimental data .",
    "the glauber approximation seems to work quite well at low cumulativity , @xmath178 ( @xmath179 gev ) . at higher @xmath2",
    "the glauber rescattering results are very different from the ones with a full relativistic treatment , both in sign and magnitude .",
    "in fact the rescattering in the glauber approximation gives a relatively small contribution , so that the total cross - section becomes quite close to the impulse approximation .",
    "it can be seen that rescattering and fft effects are necessary in order to improve the agreement at high cumulativity but they tend to destroy the better agreement between experimental data and the pwia .      according to ( [ sigt ] ) the cross section for the exclusive process @xmath22 has the following form _",

    "8 illustrates fft effects , which are given by the difference between the full curves , which include _ both _ rescattering and fft effects , and the dashed curves , which include only rescattering effects .",

    "the results at @xmath186 are presented in figs . 9 and 10 .",
    "because of kinematical restrictions imposed by energy conservation , only limited ranges of variation of @xmath194 are allowed . fig .",
    "9 shows that with increasing momentum transfer fsi effects decrease in an appreciable way which is due , as illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , to fft effects , which makes the distorted cross - section more similar to the pwia one .",
    "note that in the cumulative region , the effective momentum distribution are lower than the the pwia results , whereas at @xmath0 one observes the opposite effect . in fig .",
    "11 @xmath191 at @xmath0 and @xmath186 are shown together to illustrate how fsi decrease with @xmath4 . eventually , in fig .",
    "12 , our rescattering results are compared with the glauber results .",
    "it can be seen that with increasing momentum transfer the glauber approximation provides very poor results , which is particularly true in the cumulativity region . in order to better understand the the difference between the effects of rescattering and and fft effects , , in fig .",
    "13 we show the transparency @xmath195 , defined as t= [ transp ] where @xmath196 includes both the rescattering and fft terms ( full lines ) or only the rescattering contribution ( dashed lines ) .",

    "@xcite ) is fixed at @xmath199 , whereas in our kinematical conditions all values of @xmath198 allowed by energy conservation are included , a qualitative agreement between the two calculations can be observed .",
    "by using a relativistic approach based upon the evaluation of feynman diagrams , we have calculated the rescattering contribution to the cross - sections of the inclusive , @xmath21 , end exclusive , @xmath22 , processes , paying particular attention to the so - called cumulative region , i.e. the region corresponding to @xmath1 . besides the @xmath200 rescattering in the final state",
    ", we have also considered colour transparency effects by introducing the finite formation time of the hit hadron ; such an approach , which is simple and physically well grounded , differs from the ones used previously mainly in that the virtuality of the hit nucleon is explicitly taken into account . to make calculation viable ,",
    "two main approximations have been adopted , namely    1 .",
    "the nuclear vertex function has been obtained by relativization of the non relativistic deuteron wave function corresponding to the @xmath156 interaction ; 2 .",
    "spin - less nucleons have been considered , but an effective nucleon form factor has been introduced to take into account magnetic moments effects .",
    "both approximations have been carefully investigated : as far as the first one is concerned , relativistic effects in the nuclear wave function appear to be relevant only at high values of @xmath194 and @xmath4 and play a minor role at @xmath201 and @xmath202 , which is the main region of our investigation ; as for the second one , we obtained a good agreement , within the pwia , between our approach and the results obtained taking spin nucleon spin correctly into account , which makes us confident in our treatment of rescattering and fft effects .",
    "concerning the main results we have obtained , they can be summarized as follows :    1 .   as shown in figs . 5 and 6 , rescattering effects in the inclusive cross section appreciably increase with @xmath2 . at @xmath203",
    "they decrease the cross section with respect to the pwia , in some disagreement with the experimental data . at such values of @xmath2",
    "the fft effects reduce the magnitude of rescattering , which changes its relative weight in a very pronounced manner due to interference with the impulse approximation contribution . at still larger values of @xmath2 rescattering increases the cross - section bringing it into better agreement with the data .",
    "this phenomenon may serve to search for fft or ct effects in the rescattering at comparatively small @xmath4 .",
    "our results show that at @xmath0 rescattering effects on the exclusive cross section @xmath22 become very important at @xmath204 and exhibit a strong @xmath4 dependence ( cf .",
    "1 ) , which may serve a significant signal about the nature of rescattering effects . in the cumulative region rescattering effects , at the same value of @xmath4 appear to be less ( cf . fig .",
    "10 ) . as for fft effects ,",
    "illustrated in figs .",
    "8 and 10 , they start to be important only at @xmath205 and high values of @xmath194 ; in particular , at @xmath1 and @xmath206 , they give at @xmath207 a contribution of about an order of magnitude ( cf . fig .",
    "we have shown that although the glauber approximation works quite well at low cumulativity , at high values of @xmath208 it fails to reproduce our relativistic rescattering both quantitatively and qualitatively .    in conclusions ,",
    "the results exhibited in this paper demonstrate that the diagrammatic approach we have developed can be successfully applied to the two body case ; the application to complex nuclei does not require additional difficulties : it is underway and the results will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",

    "this work was partly supported by the rffi grants 01 - 02 - 17137 and 0015 - 96 - 737 ( russia ) .",
    "the central quantity we have to calculate is @xmath154 given by ( [ iksmu ] ) . according to ( [ denom ] ) , when fft is taken into account , it is a difference of two terms x_=x_^(1)-x_^(2 ) which differ in the propagator of the ejectile .",
    "both terms are calculated in a similar manner , the only difference being the mass of the ejectile . in the following",
    "we discuss the first term , not specifying it explicitly .",
    "the components of the vector @xmath84 ( eq .",
