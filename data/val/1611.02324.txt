    "the first solution of einstein field equations which is its only @xmath0d spherically symmetric vacuum solution , describing the first black hole was given by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "moreover many other black hole solutions have been found until now .",
    "black holes possess a special null surface called event horizon generated by a null killing vector field , where no object behind it can escape to infinity .",
    "bekenstein discovered that to prevent the violation of the second law of thermodynamics in the presence of a black hole , it must be viewed as a thermodynamic object with entropy .",
    "hawking showed that the black hole acts as a black body with the finite temperature which can radiate away its mass .",
    "thermodynamic behaviour of black holes points to the existence of an underlying black hole microstates structure .",
    "one of the main curiosities is : how can these microstates from statistical viewpoints explain the macroscopic bekenstein - hawking entropy ? however a complete answer has not been given yet , but in string theory , for a large class of extremal supersymmetric black holes this question has been answered @xcite that bekenstein - hawking entropy can be reproduced from a statistical entropy as the logarithm of the degeneracy of bps states indeed @xcite .",
    "recently a new proposal has been demonstrated in @xcite and evaluated in @xcite that the microstates of @xmath6-dimensional btz black holes can be identified by the conserved charges related to non - trivial diffeomorphisms on the near horizon region .",
    "the kerr / cft correspondence @xcite provides a rich setup , supporting whatever the states of quantum gravity in the near horizon region of an extremal kerr - ads black hole , they are holographically dual to quantum states of a two - dimensional chiral ( left - moving part ) cft . since then many further examples @xcite have been investigated for a large class of black hole solutions . in all cases",
    "the statistical microscopic entropy of the dual cft using the cardy formula @xcite precisely agrees with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the black holes .",
    "there is a classification of black hole solutions based on their horizon topology . in particular ,",
    "the famous hawking theorem for stationary , asymptotically flat vacuum einstein black hole solutions in @xmath0-dimension asserts that their horizon topologies necessarily are @xmath7 . by relaxing",
    "some of the hawking s theorem assumptions , one may comes up with the some classes of black hole solutions with different horizon topology , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( black ring solutions ) horizon topologies in five - dimension .",
    "also in asymptotically ads spacetimes , the horizon of a black hole may have a compact riemann surface of any genus @xmath10 instead of spherical horizons @xcite , as well as black ring solutions with horizon topology @xmath11 . in the case of adding rotation to them",
    ", the horizon would then be non - compact and the obtaining geometries describe a rotating black membranes with horizon topology @xmath12 .",
    "it was shown in four - dimension in @xcite and elaborated upon in @xcite that in einstein - maxwell - lambda theory or more generally , in the presence of a scalar potential for @xmath13 gauged supergravity , one can obtain black hole solutions with non - compact horizon topology with finite area , which can be topologically viewed as spheres with two punctures .",
    "other examples of this kind of topology were constructed in @xcite by performing ultra - spinning ( super - entropic ) limit to kerr - ads and @xmath14-dimensional multi - spinning myers - perry black holes .",
    "the first effort to study ultra - spinning black holes was done by emparan and myers @xcite for exploring the stability of myers - perry black holes in any arbitrarily large angular momentum with keeping mass fixed , in which the rotation parameter @xmath15 .",
    "one result is that area decreases as angular momentum increases , and in higher dimensional @xmath14 , area shrinks to zero . by capturing the null geodesics in the plane of rotation",
    "one can realizes that the horizon of this kind of ultra - spinning black hole is highly spread out in the plane of rotation while shrinking in the perpendicular direction .",
    "also it was argued that a gregory - laflamme - type instability can be seen for these solutions .",
    "the analogue limit can be used in the case of rotating ads black holes in @xmath16 by taking the rotation parameter @xmath17 , approaches the ads radius @xmath18 , which gives the geometry of a black membrane by keeping the mass of the black hole fixed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "another technique is proposed by which one can also perform @xmath15 while restricting the ratio @xmath19 to remain fixed .",
    "furthermore , caldarelli et al . have constructed a new type of solution with horizon topology @xmath20 by keeping the horizon radius @xmath21 fixed while zooming in to the pole and taking @xmath22 , which is called hyperboloid membrane limit @xcite . recently",
    "a simple ultra - spinning ( super - entropic ) limit was introduced in @xcite for kerr - newman - ads and @xmath14-dimensional multi - spinning myers - perry black holes .",
    "this technique begins with the kerr - ads black hole in asymptotically rotating frame , and then boosting this rotation to the maximum value @xmath23 while keeping the metric finite by introducing a change to corresponding azimuthal coordinate and finally one can compactify this new coordinate to generate a new rapid black hole solution .",
    "the resulting black hole has an interesting feature , which is having a non - compact horizon but finite area .",
    "also it was shown in the context of an extended thermodynamic phase space where the cosmological constant can vary @xcite , the entropy of some of these new solutions violate the ` reverse isoperimetric inequality ' , so such black holes are called super - entropic @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to find new rotating black hole solutions by taking the recent ultra - spinning ( super - entropic ) limit @xcite on the some existent black holes .",
    "the interesting geometry of resulting ultra - spinning black holes motivated us to further explore the applicability of this limit for some gauged supergravity black holes in @xmath0 and @xmath2 dimensions to generate a new sort of black hole solutions .",
    "since supergravity solutions correspond to consistent string theory backgrounds , microscopic degeneracy of states can be investigated using the ads / cft correspondence providing more motivation for their study in ultra - spinning limit .",
    "we will focus specifically on two gauged supergravity solutions in @xmath13 and @xmath24 .",
    "after that the kerr / cft correspondence for obtaining gauged supergravity ultra - spinning black holes are investigated .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that despite the non - compactness of event horizons there exists this correspondence for the ultra - spinning kerr - newmann - ads black hole as well as the ultra - spinning limit of minimal gauged supergravity black holes in five dimension .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section-4d ] ,",
    "we consider @xmath1 gauged supergravity black hole in @xmath0-dimension and we shall discuss the geometry of obtained ultra - spinning limit version .",
    "we then explore extremality conditions and near horizon limit under ultra - spinning limit for this black hole , indicating that both of them commute with the ultra - spinning limit .",
    "next we p rovide a brief review of kerr / cft correspondence , followed by finding microscopic entropy via cardy formula which exactly equals to the black hole entropy . in section [ section-5d ]",
    "we have presented a similar analysis for multi - spinning @xmath3 gauged supergravity black hole in @xmath2-dimension .",
    "our conclusions with some remarks are given in section [ discussion ] .",
    "here , we consider four - dimensional rotating gauged supergravity black hole with pairwise - equal charged which is constructed first in @xcite as a @xmath25 abelian subgroup of the @xmath26 gauged @xmath27@xmath28 supergravity . this solution can be consistently embedded in @xmath29@xmath30 gauged supergravity , in which two independent electromagnetic charges can be carried by fields in @xmath31 subgroups of the two @xmath32 sectors in @xmath33 .",

    "four field strengths can be written in terms of potentials as @xmath40 and @xmath10 denotes the gauge - coupling constant , which is related to the ads radius @xmath18 by @xmath41 .",
    "its non - extremal black hole solution in asymptotic rotating frame ( arf ) is given by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 also axion , dilaton and gauge potentials are read @xmath44 the coordinate change @xmath45 yields an asymptotically static frame ( asf ) .",

    "the charge quantities including mass , angular momentum and pairwise electric potentials were constructed in @xcite are @xmath48 in the next subsection we use the ultra - spinning ( super - entropic ) limit upon the metric ( [ metric4d ) ] ) in order to obtain a new charged - ads black hole solution in gauged supergravity .",
    "this novel ultra - spinning ( super - entropic ) limit can be interpreted as a simple method to generate a new black hole solution in which the rotation parameter @xmath17 , reaches to its maximum amount , equal to the ads radius @xmath18 .",

    "iii ) in final step , we compactify the new azimuthal direction @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we note that employing an asymptotically rotating coordinate should be assumed as a crucial point in the ultra - spinning limit technique .",
    "the uniqueness of the choice of arf to have a non - singular black hole solution has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , avoiding to start from an arf leads us to a singular limit .      since the metric ( [ metric4d ) ] )",
    "is already written in an asymptotically rotating frame , we therefore need only to introduce a new azimuthal coordinate @xmath50 followed by taking the limit @xmath23 .",
    "hence we straightforwardly obtain the following solution @xmath51 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by ( [ metric4d-2 ) ] ) as @xmath23 .",

    "since the new azimuthal coordinate @xmath35 is non - compact , we now compactify it by requiring @xmath55 where the parameter @xmath56 is dimensionless . note , there is still an axial killing vector @xmath57 in the new coordinate direction @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to show that the obtained metric ( [ usmetric4d ] ) appears as a new exact solution . also we can easily find dilaton , axion and gauge fields in this limit as @xmath58    * horizon geometry : * to ensure that the new solution ( [ usmetric4d ] ) is describing a black hole , we examine the largest root of @xmath52 in ( [ usmetric4d ] ) which is supposed to demonstrate the location of the horizon as @xmath21 .",

    "apparently @xmath65 is positive in whole spacetime .",

    "the induced metric on a constant @xmath66 surface yields , @xmath67 where @xmath68",
    ". however , this geometry seems to be singular in @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we will show that the symmetry axis @xmath71 is actually not part of the spacetime . for a precise study about these poles",

    "note , due to the symmetry , the @xmath77 limit gets the same result .",
    "thus , there is no true singularity at these two points , but some sort of boundaries .",
    "therefore topologically , the event horizon is sphere with two punctures , which implies that our obtained new black hole enjoys a finite area but non - compact horizon .    in order to visualize the geometry of the horizon ( [ ds2h-1 ] ) we can embed it in euclidean @xmath6-space as a surface of revolution @xcite .",
    "we then identify the induced metric on the horizon ( [ ds2h-1 ] ) by using a flat metric in cylindrical coordinates as , @xmath78 and consider @xmath79 , @xmath80 . setting @xmath81 ,",

    "<S> the obtained new exact black hole solutions for both cases possess a non - compact horizon ; their topologies are sphere with two punctures . we then demonstrate that the ultra - spinning limit commutes with the extremality condition as well as the near horizon limit for both black holes . we also show that the near horizon extremal geometries of the resulting ultra - spinning gauged supergravity black holes lead to the well - known result which contains an ads@xmath4 throat . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain the @xmath5 $ ] central charges of the dual cfts . by assuming the cardy formula , </S>",
    "<S> we show that despite the non - compactness of the horizon , microscopic entropy of the dual cft is precisely equivalent to the bekenstein - hawking entropy .     </S>",
