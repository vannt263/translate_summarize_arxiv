    "charge distributions in stable nuclei have been reliably measured by electron elastic scattering and muonic x - ray data  @xcite .",
    "these charge - sensitive experiments have provided precise information on charge distributions . on the other hand , it is much more difficult to deduce neutron density distributions , since electromagnetic interaction provides little information on neutron density distributions . the proton and neutron density distributions have a similar shape in stable nuclei .",
    "however in recent research it has been reported that in some unstable nuclei the differences between proton and neutron shapes are greater than those in stable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it has also been indicated that the thickness of the neutron skin is closely related to the symmetry term of the equation of state  ( eos )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the determination of neutron density distributions has become increasingly important .",
    "there have been many experiments attempting to extract neutron and matter density distributions in the nuclear interior using hadronic probes  @xcite .",
    "pion and alpha elastic scattering have been performed in the study of neutron and matter density distributions  @xcite .",
    "compared with other hadronic probes , the elastic scattering of protons at intermediate energies is suitable for extracting information on the nuclear surface and interior , because at intermediate energies , proton elastic scattering has a simple reaction mechanism . to deduce nuclear densities using protons , the incident energy has to be sufficiently high to describe the scattering by the simple mechanism . at energies above 100  mev",
    ", we can explain proton elastic scattering microscopically , because the imaginary part of the optical potential describes a quasi - free process mainly without the need for a renormalization factor .",
    "so far , energies above 500  mev have been applied for proton elastic scattering to study neutron density distributions  @xcite .",
    "however , this energy is sufficiently high to produce mesons , and information on the nuclear interior is easily masked by the meson - productions .",
    "furthermore , the total cross section of nucleon - nucleon scattering shows a minimum at the incident energy of 300  mev .",
    "we thus adopt 300 mev protons in this work as probes for information on the nuclear interior .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite , we tuned the effective relativistic love - franey interaction by introducing so - called medium effects for the scattering from a nucleus whose density distribution is well known .",
    "we used elastic scattering from @xmath2ni to tune the interaction , since @xmath2ni is the heaviest stable nucleus with n @xmath3 z and the density distribution of the neutrons in @xmath2ni can be assumed to be the same as that for the protons . to explain the results of our experiments we found that we had to modify the scattering amplitudes of the nucleon - nucleon interactions inside the nucleus as follows .",
    "we phenomenologically changed the masses and coupling constants of exchanged mesons depending on the nuclear density .",
    "thus , we could explain the scattering sufficiently well to deduce the matter density distribution precisely .",
    "for our first systematic search for neutron density distributions , we selected tin isotopes",
    ". tin has many stable isotopes  ( @xmath4sn-@xmath5sn ) .",
    "also , unstable tin isotopes have a long isotopic chain including two double - magic nuclei  ( @xmath6sn  [ n=50 ] , @xmath7sn  [ n=82 ] ) .",
    "moreover , its proton number is a magic number  ( z=50 ) .",
    "thus , tin isotopes are suitable for the study of systematic changes in neutron density distributions .",
    "the main purposes of this work are to attempt to deduce information on neutron density distributions , and to systematically study the neutron skin thickness of tin isotopes . the experimental setup and procedure",
    "are described in sec .",
    "details of the analysis used to deduce neutron density distributions are given in sec .",

    "the measurements were performed at the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) , osaka university . polarized protons from a high - intensity polarized ion source",
    "were injected into an avf cyclotron , transported to a six - sector ring cyclotron and accelerated up to 295 mev .",
    "the polarization axis was in the vertical direction .",
    "the spin direction and magnitude of the beam polarization were measured continuously using sampling - type beam - line polarimeters ( blps )  @xcite placed between the ring cyclotron and a scattering chamber .",
    "each polarimeter utilized left - right asymmetries in p - h scattering from ( ch@xmath8)@xmath9 foil to determine the vertical transverse component @xmath10 of the beam polarization .",
    "the typical beam polarization was 65% .",
    "then the beam was transported to a target center in the scattering chamber .",
    "the typical beam spot size on the target during measurements was 1  mm in diameter .",
    "finally , the beam was stopped by an internal faraday cup inside the scattering chamber in the case of forward - angle measurements . in the measurements at backward scattering angles ,",
    "the beam was transported to another faraday cup located inside the shielding wall of the experimental room about 25  m downstream of the scattering chamber .",
    "the integrated beam current was monitored using a current digitizer  ( model 1000c ) made by bic  ( brookhaven instruments corporation ) . additionally , the beam current was monitored independently using p - p cross sections at the blps during the backward - angle measurements . five tin isotope targets  ( @xmath0sn ) in the form of self - supporting metal foils",
    "were used for this experiment .",
    "two different thicknesses were used for each target .",
    "thin targets were used for the forward - angle measurements to reduce the dead time of the data acquisition system , and thick targets were for the backward - angle measurements to increase the yields .",

    "the situation is similar to the case of @xmath2ni .",
    "thus , the effect from the coupled channel is masked by the uncertainties of our introduced medium effects in this analysis .",
    "also , the coupled - channel effect might be partly included in our parametrization because we aimed to phenomenologically reproduce the experimental data .",
