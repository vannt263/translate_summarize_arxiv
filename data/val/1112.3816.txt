    "several years ago it was suggested that two noninteracting condensates trapped in a double well trap at zero temperature would give rise to the bosonic analog of a josephson junction @xcite .",

    "different interesting regimes and behaviors were predicted for the system depending on the value of the effective interaction among the bosons in each of the two wells of the trapping potential .",
    "these include the so - called macroscopic self - trapping phenomenon and a dynamical bifurcation corresponding to a localization transition in the ground - state of the system @xcite .",
    "just a few years after the above mentioned theoretical work , brilliant experiments were carried out with ultra - cold atomic gases where the predicted josephson oscillations , macroscopic nonlinear self - trapping and dynamical bifurcation were observed @xcite .    the quantum version of the discrete gross - pitaevskii equations  known as discrete self - trapping ( dst ) equations @xcite among the nonlinear community  was also widely investigated @xcite .",
    "in particular , a significant amount of attention @xcite was directed to the quantum counterpart of the abovementioned dynamical transition from a localized to a delocalized regime , which , in this paper will be clearly recognized , as a quantum phase transition .",
    "in particular we carry out a detailed analysis of the ground state of the system which , at the quantum level , is described by a two - mode bose - hubbard model .",
    "we identify five regimes depending on the effective bosonic interaction .",

    "our analysis is not restricted to the ground - state of the system , i.e. to the zero - temperature case .",
    "we also consider finite temperatures , and evidence a different scaling of the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the population imbalance in the critical regime .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the quantum hamiltonian employed in the description of the two - mode system , and discuss its relation with similar models , as well as with the semiclassical dst equations ; in section [ sle ] we illustrate how the low - lying spectrum of the quantum hamiltonian can be equivalently investigated by means of a schrdinger - like equation for a fictitious particle on a one - dimensional domain , and observe that the semiclassical dst equations naturally emerge from a small - oscillation approach around the minima of the potential energy .",
