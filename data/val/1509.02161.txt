    "these papers , in turn , refer to the earlier work in atomic polarizability carried out by sternheimer@xcite and dalgarno and parkinson@xcite . however , they focused on the final photoionization cross section results , and did not provide details about the quality of the potentials and the wavefunctions they generated .    assuming the validity of the separation between exchange and correlation functionals",
    ", we will focus here only on the calculation of the exchange contribution to the potential . since hartree  fock",
    "does not include the correlations , our approach allows to obtain the `` exact '' one  electron local potential representing the exchange interactions . strictly speaking",
    ", the method does not rely on the ks inversion formula since the hartree ",
    "fock solutions were the ones used for the inversion .",
    "that is , we solved a ks  type equation , but rather than having ks  orbitals , we operated directly with the hartree ",
    "fock wavefunctions . for open  shell atoms",
    ", we were able to find orbital spin ",
    "polarized exchange potentials , this being crucial , for instance , to find the hyperfine coupling constants@xcite .",
    "however , this is not a simple task , and probably that is why the method presented here has not been widely applied in the past .",
    "if the wavefunction has nodes , it will produce huge poles in the potential .",
    "moreover , even for nodeless states , the asymptotic decaying behavior of the bound wavefunctions produces severe numerical difficulties , making the inversion operation intractable sometimes . in our method",
    ", a depuration procedure follows the inversion .",
    "this depuration implies , first , the annihilation of the poles .",
    "then , a careful optimization of the potential which ensures the fulfillment of the appropriate boundary conditions .",

    "section [ sec : theory ] describes the method , which includes the inversion procedure ( [ subsec : directinversion ] ) , the potential depuration ( [ subsec : depuration ] ) and its further optimization ( [ subsec : optimization ] ) . section [ sec : results ] presents the resulting effective potentials for the orbitals corresponding to the ground states of different noble gases , including a thorough examination of the wavefunctions generated by these potentials ( [ subsec : resultsdim ] ) .",

    "fock wavefunctions : @xmath6 u_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}(r )     = \\varepsilon_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}\\ , u_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}(r ) \\ , .",

    "we have ignored the correlation term since the hf solutions do not include  it .    since the solutions @xmath4 are known ( calculated numerically with the hf code by c. f. fischer @xcite , and the nrhf code by w. johnson @xcite ) we proceeded to directly invert the kohn  sham  type equations : @xmath11 obtaining the _ hf inverted potential _ @xmath12 . assuming a coulombic  type shape , it is convenient to define an _ hf inverted charge _ @xmath13    the direct computation of ( [ eq : v ] ) is known to pose serious numerical problems@xcite .",
    "_ first _ , the presence of ( genuine ) nodes in the wave function to be inverted produces poles and unrealistic features around them .",
    "this has led to the general consensus that the inversion method can only be used for nodeless orbitals@xcite . _",
    "second _ , numerical rounding up of the exponential decay of the bound states hinders the corresponding inverted potential from having the physically desired asymptotic form .",
    "moreover , there is a _",
    "third _ problem at the very heart of the hartree fock method : the exact solutions may have oscillations ( and therefore , spurious nodes ) in the large  r or `` tail '' region of the functions .",
    "the existence of these spurious nodes in hartree fock was already suggested by fischer@xcite .",
    "this failure is not caused by the numerical scheme but it is inherent to the method . probably , these nodes are surviving long  range exchange effects due to the non  local character of the hartree  fock wavefunctions : the behavior of a particular orbital depends on all others .",
    "we have found the same spurious nodes at the same places even using different numerical codes . as a general rule , the spurious nodes appear at very long distances , in regions where the amplitude of the wavefunction is very small . therefore , their existence has no practical consequences , and they can be ignored in any general hartree  fock calculation .",
    "however , this is not true as far as the inversion procedure is concerned , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "other examples where the presence of orbital nodes ( both formal and those in the tail region ) can be problematic in inversion procedures can be found in the literature ( see for instance peach _",
    "et al._@xcite ) .",
    "the difficulties mentioned above make it very hard to obtain the correct @xmath12 potentials using the simple inversion formula given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) . to overcome these troubles",
    "we have developed a depurated inversion method ( dim ) which optimizes the effective charges rather than the effective potentials .",
    "we managed to constrain any potential to have the right boundary conditions by enforcing the _ effective depurated inverted charge _ to behave as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nuclear charge .",
    "once the charge is determined at the boundaries , we can obtain a smooth analytic expression for @xmath16 , fitting the @xmath17 for the largest possible range , except in the neighborhood of the nodes .",
    "all this can be accomplished by imposing the effective dim charge to fit the following analytical expression : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .    as a clear instance of the numerical problems mentioned and the way",
    "propose to solve them , we show , in figure [ fig:2skr ] , the orbital @xmath20 of the ground state of the kr atom ( part ( a ) ) , and its correspondent effective charge @xmath21 ( dashed line curve , in part ( b ) ) .",
    "first , note that the @xmath22 orbital has a genuine node at @xmath23 a.u . which produces the first pole in the effective charge , as shown in the lower graph .",
    "the node appears at a relatively low@xmath24 value , so the corresponding charge ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeff ] ) ) is not very sensitive to its presence .",
    "therefore , it is very easy to eliminate the pole from the effective charge ( by just erasing a few points around this radius ) .",
    "corresponding to the ground state of the kr atom .",
    "it presents two nodes , a genuine one at @xmath23 a.u . , and a spurious one at @xmath25 a.u .",
    "( shown in the inset ) .",
    "( b ) dashed line : the corresponding inverted effective charge @xmath21 , spoiled by the presence of poles . solid line : depurated @xmath26 effective charge.,width=319 ]    all the bound wavefunctions decay exponentially beyond the last turning point @xmath27 , defined as the position in which the energy equals the effective potential . at first glance",
    ", it seems that the turning point of @xmath28 is located around @xmath29 , and from that point on , the wavefunction should start to decay exponentially .",
    "from the numerically point of view , @xmath30 is a good point to stop the inversion , since beyond there , the effective charge could begin to diverge .",
    "thus , one might infer that by erasing the points belonging to the neighborhood of the first node , and by stopping the inversion about @xmath31 , the inversion procedure will work well .",
    "however , the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig:2skr](b ) shows a completely unphysical @xmath32 resulting from the inversion . a very careful examination of the @xmath20 orbital function evidences the presence of a spurious node at @xmath33 a.u .",
    ", in a region where the amplitude of the wavefunction is less than @xmath34 times the maximum value ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2skr](a ) ) .",
    "even though this node is completely innocuous for practical matters , it produces devastating effects in the inversion procedure , evidenced by the second huge peak in the @xmath21 curve ( see figure [ fig:2skr](b ) ) .",
    "this pole is so big that it affects a broad vicinity and causes the abrupt rising of the effective charge for @xmath35 a.u .. this is really a surprising result since _ a priory _ there is no reason to suspect that a negligible oscillation in the tail of the wavefunction would produce such a big drawback at small distances .",
    "care must be taken then to discard these kind of undesired effects .",
    "the adjustment of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 also requires carefull work .",
    "the key issue in the successful approximation is the region chosen for the fitting : it has to be as large as possible , in such a way that @xmath16 overlaps the inverted @xmath17 across a broad range , allowing an accurate fitting procedure , but discarding the points surrounding the nodes . also , the inversion must be halted at a particular ( as large as possible ) @xmath24 value , as soon as the amplitude of the function is too small .",
    "further on , the inversion procedure diverges .",
    "another issue to consider is the self consistency within the computer codes used in the calculations and the particular code used to generate the input wavefunctions . to that end",
    ", we make sure that the same specific numerical grid is used , including the derivatives and integrals at the same pivots . the optimization procedure is completed by a number of iteration steps , in which the parameters are optimized to give accurate energies and wavefuntions .",
    "most density functional approximation methods are based on a variational principle , minimizing the density functionals according to energy ( others are defined by density ) . without underestimating its importance ,",
    "energy is only one of the many parameters that characterizes a quantum state .",
    "different trial functions ( having different forms ) can produce , through a variational procedure , the same final energy .",
    "a simple example is given by bartschat @xcite in which two different potentials ( one having exchange , the other omitting it ) led to producing very similar and accurate energies of the rydberg series in several quasi ",
    "one electron systems .",
    "however , a further examination of these potentials shows large discrepancies in scattering calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the energy criterion , we have included in our optimization method a variational procedure to reproduce accurately the wavefunctions .",
    "this is achieved by optimizing the mean values @xmath38 ( which characterize the quality of the wavefunction near the origin ) , and @xmath39 ( probing it at longer distances ) .",
    "furthermore , we defined the quantity @xmath40 to determine the accuracy of the orbitals generated by the diagonalization of the dim potentials and the original hf orbitals .",
    "the effective depurated inversion charge @xmath26 corresponding to the @xmath22 orbital of the kr atom resulting from the optimization is shown solid curve in figure [ fig:2skr](b ) .",
    "as seen in the figure , both boundary conditions are fulfilled ( at the origin , @xmath41 , and asymptotically @xmath42 , as stated in eq .",
