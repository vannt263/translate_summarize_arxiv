    "the generation and detection of entangled states of macroscopic mechanical oscillators is an outstanding task in the study of mechanical systems in the quantum regime @xcite .",

    "perhaps most promising amongst these are approaches based on reservoir engineering @xcite , whereby the dissipation is engineered such that the steady - state of the dissipative dynamics is the desired target state .",
    "these proposals are highly attractive from an experimental point - of - view , requiring relatively minor modifications of existing experimental configurations @xcite .    here we propose an approach for generating highly - pure , highly - entangled two - mode squeezed states of two mechanical oscillators via coupling to a driven cavity mode .",
    "the two - mode squeezed state is the simultaneous vacuum of two non - local bosonic operators ( so - called bogoliubov modes ) @xcite .",
    "hence it is possible to prepare a mechanical two - mode squeezed state by cooling these two modes .",
    "this can be achieved using two independent reservoirs ( see , e.g. refs .  ) . here",
    "however , we show that the same goal can be achieved using just a _ single _ reservoir . by making the bogoliubov modes",
    "non - degenerate they will couple to different frequency components of a single reservoir ( that is , the damped cavity ) . since the bogoliubov transformation preserves the difference in number operators , this simply corresponds to a frequency difference of the two mechanical oscillators .",
    "viewed differently , one can say that we are exploiting the coherent dynamics of the mechanical oscillators to effectively cool both bogoliubov modes .",
    "ultimately , our protocol simply involves appropriately weighted and detuned two - tone or four - tone driving of the coupled cavity mode . note that the entanglement of oscillators interacting with a common reservoir has also been discussed in ref .  .",
    "the approach we take here may be regarded as the coherent feedback @xcite analogue of our measurement - based approach to the same task @xcite , and is related to a recent proposal for the preparation of a quantum squeezed state of a single mechanical oscillator @xcite . as compared with the measurement - based approach for entanglement generation in ref .",

    "however , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and therefore , the ground state of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the two - mode squeezed state with squeezing parameter @xmath26 .",
    "our goal then is to engineer the driving hamiltonian of ( [ eq : hamone ] ) such that the steady - state of ( [ eq : meoriginal ] ) results in the @xmath35 modes being cooled to their ground state , implying two - mode squeezing of the mechanical oscillators .",

    "both bogoliubov modes are independently coupled to a cavity mode with a beam - splitter - like interaction , i.e. @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , an interaction which can be used to cool the bogoliubov modes @xcite .",
    "while such an approach can be effective , from a practical point of view it would be highly advantageous if this could be achieved using only a single cavity mode .",
    "a seemingly simple way of using only a single reservoir would be to couple the cavity to one of the bogoliubov modes , say @xmath33 , and then couple @xmath33 to the other bogoliubov mode ( @xmath34 ) via an all - mechanical contribution to the hamiltonian of the form @xmath38 , again a beam - splitter - like interaction .",
    "this interaction will allow @xmath34 to be cooled ( by swapping quanta into @xmath33 ) even though it is not directly coupled to the cooling reservoir . while conceptually simple , the requisite mechanical interaction would be difficult to realise , requiring the direct coupling of the mechanical oscillators .",
    "such a hamiltonian was considered in ref .  ,",
    "albeit without a physical implementation specified .",
    "a third approach , which we will pursue here , is to couple the cavity to the sum of bogoliubov modes , @xmath39 , and then couple the sum mode to the difference mode via an all - mechanical hamiltonian contribution of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "again , the swap interaction allows @xmath42 to be cooled even though it is not directly coupled to the cavity . cooling both @xmath43 and @xmath42 is equivalent to cooling both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , since @xmath44 .",
    "while this approach again seems to involve the realization of a challenging interaction between bogoliubov modes , this is not the case .",
    "the beam - splitter interaction here takes the simple form : @xmath45 .",
    "thus , one does not require a direct interaction between the mechanical oscillators , but rather just a difference in their resonance frequencies .",
    "this is the key insight that allows one to appropriately engineer the reservoir via a single cavity mode .    as noted in sec .",

    "<S> we study theoretically a three - mode optomechanical system where two mechanical oscillators are independently coupled to a single cavity mode . by optimized two - tone or four - tone driving of the cavity </S>",
    "<S> one can prepare the mechanical oscillators in an entangled two - mode squeezed state , even if they start in a thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> the highly - pure , symmetric steady - state achieved allows the optimal fidelity of standard continuous - variable teleportation protocols to be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other reservoir engineering approaches to generating mechanical entanglement , only a single reservoir is required to prepare the highly - pure entangled steady - state , greatly simplifying experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement may be verified via a bound on the duan inequality obtained from the cavity output spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> a similar technique may be used for the preparation of a highly - pure two - mode squeezed state of two cavity modes , coupled to a common mechanical oscillator . </S>"
