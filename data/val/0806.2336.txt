    "over the last decade , spectroscopic surveys targeting faint stars with large proper motions have identified many subdwarfs with m spectral types .",
    "these surveys generally make use of the spectral classification scheme developed by gizis ( 1997 ) which employs measures of the cah and tio bands in the 63007100    spectral region to form the indices cah1 , cah2 , cah3 , and tio as defined in reid et al .",
    "the locations in the three diagrams for the cah indices versus the tio index serve to separate the stars into three spectral metallicity classes designated mv for dwarfs with [ m / h]@xmath40.0 , sdm for the cool counterparts to the classical sdf ",

    ", there was only one star with subclass type later than sdm4.5 known  namely lhs377 , which was assigned the type sdm7  by definition \" ( gizis &  harvin 2006 ) .",
    "it has since become routine to consolidate the essential features of the gizis classification scheme into a single diagram consisting of [ cah2  +  cah3 ] versus tio5 ( cf .",
    ", lpine et al . 2004 ) , retaining the revised divisions between the three metallicity subclasses proposed by burgasser &  kirkpatrick ( 2006 ) .",
    "further revision and extension of the gizis system have been proposed by lpine et al .",
    "a fourth subclass designated  usdm \" indicating  ultrasubdwarfs \" was added to the three - subclass scheme to recognize the relatively few m stars which apparently have metallicities as low as or perhaps below [ m / h]@xmath142.5 .",
    "a realignment of the subclass separators was put forward based on a new index , @xmath15 , which measures the calibrated tio5 spectral index as a function of the [ cah2  +  cah3 ] index and is expressed as a ratio with the solar metallicity value .",
    "the separators are chosen so that they run parallel to the locii in the [ cah2  +  cah3 ,  tio5 ] plane for the observed components of wide common proper motion binaries with different spectral subtypes .",
    "a proposed list of subdwarf spectral classification standard stars were presented covering types k7.0 through m8.5 for each of the subclasses subdwarf , extreme subdwarf , and ultrasubdwarf . as further suggested by burgasser et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , one really needs to simultaneously utilize spectral classification criteria from a wider range of wavelengths and low - resolution data covering the range 0.72.5 @xmath16 m as a possible way to proceed in the future .",

    "in particular we note the abnormally strong al  i doublet at 1.313  @xmath16 m which suggests that aluminum is most likely overabundant compared with solar .    in a study concurrent with that of cv06 , reiners &  basri ( 2006 ; hereafter rb06 ) obtained high - resolution ( r@xmath431000 ) spectra in several windows of the 0.71.0@xmath22 m region for lsr1610@xmath000 , gl406 , and 2mass  1439 + 1929 ( hereafter , 2m1439 + 19 ) .",
    "the latter is a l1v star with an established trigonometrically determined luminosity ( dahn et al .",
    "comparision of the strengths of tio bands with heads at 7050 , 8430 , and 8870   do not preclude the possibility that lsr1610@xmath000 might be slightly metal deficient .",
    "on the other hand , comparison of metal hydride bands ( e.g. , cah at 6800    and feh at 9900   ) indicate that lhs1610@xmath000 can not be very much more metal - deficient than is gl406 .",
    "as pointed out earlier by both lrs03 and cv06 , the primary discrepancies arise for a few atomic lines .",
    "in particular , the rb  i lines at 7947 and 7800   agree much better with those in 2m1439 + 19 , not only in strength but in shape . in contrast , the cs  i lines at 8520 and 8944   are much weaker in lsr1610@xmath000 than in 2m1439 + 19 , with the redder one being almost undetectable .",

    "the strengths of the ca  ii triplet components at 8498 and 8542   imply that lsr1610@xmath000 must be at least as warm as gl406 . comparing the spectra of lsr1610@xmath000 and 2m1439 + 19 with phoenix atmospheric model predictions ( cf .",

    "calibration of the extension to the gizis subdwarf - m spectral classification system to physical parameters such as total luminosities and effective temperatures , such as proposed by lpine et al .",

    "a representative sample of such m - type subdwarfs is currently being observed at the flagstaff station .",
    "both lsr1425 + 71 and lsr1610@xmath000 were added to the usno ccd trigonometric parallax program back in the spring of 2003 and reliable results are now available for these two stars . since",

    "differential color refraction corrections for astrometric observations taken slightly off the meridian were derived from the v@xmath0i colors of the parallax star and the reference stars employed , as described in monet et al .",
    "the corrections from relative to absolute parallax were derived from photometric parallaxes of the individual references stars using m@xmath2 versus v@xmath0i relations calibrated with stars with large trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the new radial velocity measure of lsr1610@xmath000 was obtained using the university of arizona / harvard  smithsonian 6.5  m mmt reflector .",
    "details regarding the results follow .      a total of 73 acceptable observations of this field have been obtained since it was added to the active program in april 2003 , providing a total epoch coverage of over 4 years .",
    "the absence of suitable reference stars close to the parallax star has necessitated the use of a fairly spread out frame which extends to about 3 arc minutes from the target star . however , since the exposure times for this field are typically 15 - 20 minutes ( depending on seeing and transparency ) good averaging over atmospheric fluctuations was achieved resulting in formal rms single observational errors for the reference stars of @xmath1  2.14 mas and @xmath1  2.25 mas in ra and dec , respectively .",
    "the astrometric and photometric results are presented in table 1 .",
    "as we shall show in section 3 below , our parallax and photometry confirm the sudwarf status of lsr1425 + 71 in three color  absolute magnitude diagrams . likewise , adopting the radial velocity of @xmath065@xmath320 km s@xmath5 measured by lepine et al .",

    "astrometric observations of lsr1610@xmath000 commenced in june 2003 and by early 2005 the residuals from the solution for parallax and proper motion clearly indicated that this object is an unresolved , astrometric binary .",
    "observational coverage of the field was intensified at that time . to date , a total of 219 acceptable observations spanning an epoch range of over 4 years has been obtained on this field .",
    "our results indicate that over two full periods of the astrometric orbit have now been covered , permitting solutions for the photocentric orbital elements as well as the parallax and proper motion for this binary system .    in carrying out the astrometric reductions for lsr1610@xmath000 we have chosen to employ an iterative procedure wherein the standard algorithms were first solved for parallax and proper motion .",
    "the residuals from this solution were then solved for the motion of the center of light about the center of mass .",
    "this resulted in preliminary orbital elements for the photocenter .",
    "these elements were then used to `` correct '' the originally measured parallax star positions , after which the solution was rerun for parallax and proper motion .",
    "the residuals from this revised solution were then resubmitted to the binary star reduction algorithms to obtain refined orbital elements .",
    "this iterative process was repeated until convergence had been achieved .",
    "only four iterations were required .",

    "figure 1 shows the the residuals in ra and dec after both the parallax and proper motion of the system have been removed , and the table 3 orbit fit to these data . in general ,",
    "the derived orbital elements appear to be quite robust .",
    "the possible exception is the eccentricity , because observations at phases around periastron passage are still not as numerous as desirable .",
    "upcoming observations during the march ",
    "october 2008 interval should resolve this situation since we predict that the photocenter will pass through eastern elongation during this window .",
    "we also note that since the observer s line of sight to the lsr1610@xmath000ab system is only 6.8@xmath31.0 degrees out of the plane of the photocentric orbit , the question of possible eclipses is raised .",
    "however , as we shall conclude in section 4 , the radii of the most probable components are small .",
    "no evidence of eclipses can be seen in our astrometric observations , but our time coverage during anticipated close passages is too spotty to provide any meaningful constraint .",
    "our confirmation that lsr1610@xmath000 is indeed an unresolved binary system opens a new dimension for understanding the seemingly `` schizophrenic spectrum '' of lsr1610@xmath000 described by cv06 .",

    "gl406 was observed as a radial velocity standard for cross - correlation reductions .",
    "the observations were generally obtained in pairs of 600 second and 300 second integrations for lsr1610@xmath000 and gl406 , respectively .",
    "each pair was bracketed by observations of the helium - neon - argon arc lamp at the position of the object .",

    "second , the components comprising lsr1610@xmath000ab can not include objects like either lsr1425 + 71 or lhs377 since both of these stars are significantly more luminous in m@xmath2 and bluer than the combined light from the astrometric binary system .",
    "finally , it is unlikely that one can invoke a normal , early - type dl star as the b component of the lsr1610@xmath000ab system in order to explain the strong rb  i@xmath21@xmath10 lines seen in the lpine et al .",

    "some aspects of the current status of such models are illustrate in figure 2 by the solid black line which represents the nextgen ( bcah98 ) isochrone for stars with masses @xmath32  0.1  m@xmath18 for an evolved age of 0.5 gyr and by the solid red line which represents the dusty ( chabrier et al .",

    "dust formation is unimportant implying that the offset between the nextgen and dusty models is primarily due to improved treatment of atmospheric opacity for tio and , to a lesser extent , cah ( allard et al . 2000 ) .",
    "still , the models remain too blue by 0.10.2 mag in the region of figure 2 corresponding to lsr1610@xmath000ab and gl406 . while better agreement between the dusty models and the field dm stars is realized for a model evolutionary age of 0.1 gyr ( see chabrier et.al 200 , fig .  4 , and the dotted red line in the present fig .  2 .",
    ") , such a young age ( younger than the pleiades cluster ! ) is certainly unrealistic for the mixture of young / old disk population field m - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( leggett 1992 ) .",
    "the blue lines in figure 2 represent the bcah97 isochrones for metal deficient stars with [ m / h ] = @xmath01.0 , @xmath01.5 , and @xmath02.0 and ages @xmath32  5 gyr .",
    "these models appeared to be in satisfactory agreement with both the hst observations of three globular clusters ( m15 , ngc6397 , @xmath36  cen ) and field halo subdwarfs with trigonometrically determined distance .",
    "all of the aforementioned data seemed to be well represented by isochrones with metallicities [ m / h ]  @xmath31  @xmath01.3 to @xmath01.5 , corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath01.6 to @xmath01.8 when allowance for oxygen enhancement over the evolutionary age of the galaxy is taken into account .",
    "this agreement provided hope that the bcah97 models might be reliable for detailed comparison with observations of metal - deficient stars where the importance of double - metal molecular bands ( e.g. , tio , vo ) are expected to be less important .",
    "however , at the time of the bcah97 paper , the globular cluster observations extended only down to luminosities of m@xmath2  @xmath31  12 and the observed field subdwarfs only reached down to m@xmath2  @xmath31  14.5 .",

    "the transformation relations derived by carpenter ( 2001 ) have been applied to the bcah97 tabulated values to convert them from the cti photometric system to the 2mass system employed here .",

    "first , the field subdwarfs seem to be reasonably in accord with the bcah97 metal - deficient isochrones for m@xmath39 below about 8.5 .",
    "however , for m@xmath39  @xmath41  8.0 the isochrones run well to the blue side of the few observational points available .",
    "lsr1425 + 71 is located nearly on the model locus for [ m / h ]  =  @xmath01.3 , consistent with its being a later - type counterpart to the field sdf / sdg stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that lsr1425 + 71 is only about 0.3 mag less luminous in m@xmath39 than the two field subdwarfs lhs  1742a ( m@xmath39  =  9.74 , i@xmath0k@xmath40  =  1.96 ) and lhs  3061 ( m@xmath39  =  9.65 ,",
    "i@xmath0k@xmath40  =  1.99 ) .",
    "this contrasts to the relative locations of these three stars in figure 2 , where lhs  1742a is about 0.8 mag more luminous than lsr1425 + 71 in m@xmath2 and lhs  3061 is a full magnitude more luminous than lsr1425 + 71 .",
    "second , the relative locations of lsr1425 + 71 and lhs377 in figure 3 indicate that lhs377 is significantly less metal deficient than lsr1425 + 71 .",
    "accepting the models at face value might lead to an estimate of [ m / h ]  @xmath24  @xmath00.8 for lhs377 .",
    "third , the location of lsr1610@xmath000ab in the midst of the disk field dwarfs again offers no clue to the nature of the individual components making up this binary .",
    "that is , it does not appear to be overluminous as would be the case if both components of the binary were contributing significant light to the photocenter . and",
    "finally , the sdl7 2m0532 + 82 lies alone in the lower part of figure 4 .",
    "since the bcah97 models include masses down to only 0.083  m@xmath18 , no reliable inference concerning the metallicity of 2m0532 + 82 is possible from figure 4 .",
    "burgasser et al . (",
    "2008 ) made a ",
    "best guess \" estimate of [ m / h ]  =  @xmath01 , implying a mass of 0.0783  @xmath1  0.0013 m@xmath18 for this unique object .    as was the case in figure 2 , the dusty model isochrone for an age of 0.5",
    "gyr ( solid red line ) does a poor job in representing the field dwarfs .",
    "likewise , the dusty model isochrone for an age of 0.1 gyr ( dotted red line ) , while in better agreement with the observational points , is still not fully satisfactory .",
    "if the discrepancies noted in the previous two cmds between observations of field m - dwarfs and solar metallicity model isochrones is primarily due to incompletenesses in the atmospheric opacities for wavelengths blueward of @xmath31  1.0  @xmath16 m , improved agreement might be expected for the m@xmath39 versus j@xmath0k@xmath40 cmd .",
    "figure 4 shows the stars under consideration in that cmd where the field dwarfs and subdwarfs , as well as model isochrones included , are the same as in figure 3 . as before ,",
    "the model data points have been converted from the cti photometric system to the 2mass system via the carpenter ( 2001 ) transformations .",
    "while shape - wise the locii for both dusty model isochrones ( red solid and dotted lines ) better reflect the trend of the m - dwarf observations to branch off to redder j@xmath0k@xmath40 below m@xmath39  @xmath24  10.0 , the 0.5 gyr isochrone ( solid red line ) fails to reproduce the field m - dwarf observations at all colors and luminosites plotted here .",
    "even the 0.1 gyr isochrone ( dotted red line ) fails to provide a satisfactory fit .",
    "the field subdwarfs , including both lsr1425 + 71 and lhs377 , seem to be well reproduced by the bcah97 models in figure 4 .",
    "again , accepting the fits at face value would imply metallicities of [ m / h ]  @xmath24  @xmath01.5  @xmath1  0.3 and [ m / h ]  @xmath24  @xmath01.0  @xmath1  0.2 for lsr1425 + 71 and lhs377 , respectively .",
    "the location of lsr1610@xmath000ab amongst the field m - dwarfs in a region of the diagram where the trend of the observational data points is nearly vertical prevents us from inferring much of interest about possible components for the system .",
    "we can note , however , that there is nothing to suggest that lsr1610@xmath000ab is a subdwarf .    in summary",
    "then , the cmds discussed here all seem to support lsr1425 + 71 being a later - type counterpart to the classical sdf / sdg field subdwarfs while lsr1610@xmath000ab exhibits no subdwarf characteristics . both the field m - dwarfs and the field m - subdwarfs",
    "remain inadequately reproduced by current models in the m@xmath2 versus v@xmath0i cmd .",
    "the field m - subdwarfs seem to be reproduced satisfactorily in both the m@xmath39 versus i@xmath0k@xmath40 and the m@xmath39 versus j@xmath0k@xmath40 cmds .",
    "the solar metallicity and near - solar metallicity models fail to adequately represent the field star m - dwarf data points in all threee cmds .",
    "hence , no substantive inferences can be drawn about the components comprising the lsr1610@xmath000ab binary from these diagrams .",
    "the similarities in seds between gl406 and lsr1610@xmath000ab noted in the above three cmds do not , apparently , extend to wavelengths as short as the b bandpass .",
    "figure 5 shows the location of the stars in the b@xmath0v versus v@xmath0i color  color diagram .",
    "unfortunately , there are only a limited number of late - type parallax dwarfs and subdwarfs with measured b magnitudes , since they are generally very faint at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the filled and open circles in figure 5 are the dwarfs and subdwarfs , respectively , shown in figure 2 where b@xmath0v photometry is available .",
    "the open triangles are stars spectoscopically classified as subdwarfs with flagstaff station photometry but lacking suitably precise parallax distance determinations at this time . as is well recognized ( e.g. , dahn et al .",
    "1995 ; fig .",
    "3 ) , subdwarfs usually lie above the dwarfs in b@xmath0v versus v@xmath0i and by amounts which appear to correlate with metal deficiency .",
    "figure 5 indicates that the blue flux from the atmospheres of lsr1610@xmath000ab is highly suppressed when compared with gl406 .",
    "lacking spectroscopic coverage over the blue region at this time , we can only speculate about possible causes ( see sec .",
    "6 below ) .",
    "the observed orbit given in table 3 is that of the photocenter ( the combined light ) of the two components .",
    "the photocenter motion is identical to the motion of the primary a component if the secondary star contributes negligible light in the observing ( @xmath42 ) bandpass .",
    "note that the a and b components can not be identical  that is , can not have the same masses and the same luminosities ( at least not in the i bandpass ) .",
    "in such a system the center of light would track the center of mass exactly and there would be no astrometric perturbation .",
    "the general equation connecting the observed semi - major axis of the photocentric orbit , @xmath38 , with the elements of the true orbit is @xmath43 where a is the semi - major axis of the relative orbit of the two components ( in au ) , a@xmath44 is the semi - major axis of the primary star ( in au ) , m@xmath45 and m@xmath46 are the masses of the primary and secondary components , respectively ( in m@xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 is the relative luminosity of the secondary star compared with the luminosity of the combined light ( van de kamp 1967 ) . if the secondary star makes a negligible contribution to the combined light , then @xmath49 = 0 and a@xmath50 ; if it contributes significantly to the combined light , then a@xmath51 .",
    "as for any binary system , the masses must satisfy the general harmonic relation @xmath52 where p is the period in sidereal years .    lacking direct observational information about the relative brightnesses of the individual a and b components at all wavelengths ( and especially at i bandpass where the perturbation was observed )",
    ", we can derive constraints about possible and impossible components from the observed orbit , the observed radial velocities , the cmds , and our current knowledge regarding the mass  luminosity relationships ( mlrs ) for low - mass stars .",
    "an additional potential constraint is the failure to detect a companion in keck ii laser guide star adaptive optic observations ( siegler et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , this null observation turns out to be of limited value because the observing epoch 2006.460 was at an orbital phase ( figure 1 ) where the photocenter was displaced from the barycenter by only 2 mas , implying a separation of the pair of only 5 mas , well below their sensitivity limits .",
    "in fact , great progress has been achieved in the last few years in measuring dynamical masses for m dwarfs , both from ground based observations employing various combinations of precision radial velocities , adaptive optics imaging , and near infrared long baseline interferometry ( sgransan et al . 2000 ; delfosse et al . 2000 ; siegler et al . 2005 ; siegler et al . 2007 ) and from space employing hst - fgs ( benedict et al .",
    "2001 ; henry 2004 ) . as a result , there are now over two dozen m dwarfs with accurately determined masses ( sgransan et al . 2000 ; sgransan et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , only one star , gj1245c (= g208 - 44b = lhs3494b ) with a dynamically measured mass of 0.074@xmath30.005 m@xmath18 ( henry et al .",
    "1999 ; henry 2004 ) , currently anchors the region @xmath290.10 m@xmath18 .",
    "two additional binaries ",
    "gl569bab , m8.5v+m9v , ( lane et al .",
    "2001 ) and 2massj0746425 + 2000321ab , l0v+l1.5v , ( bouy et al . 2004 )  have astrometrically determined orbits and resulting total mass determinations which indicate individual components with masses @xmath290.10 m@xmath18 .",
    "conversion to actual individual masses for both systems is , unfortunately , still model dependent at this stage .",
    "hopefully , precision radial velocity measures will soon resolve the remaining ambiguities .",
    "we also acknowledge in passing that many new binaries with low - mass components and estimated periods as short as a few years have been identified recently ( e.g. , forveille et al . 2005 ; siegler et al . 2005 ; siegler et al . 2007 ) and reliable dynamical mass determinations for a number of objects with masses @xmath290.10 m@xmath18 should be forthcoming in just a few years .",
    "we consider first the possibility that the secondary contributes virtually no light to the observed combined light in the i bandpass , here taken to mean i@xmath53@xmath0i@xmath54@xmath556.5 mag so that i@xmath54@xmath0i@xmath56@xmath570.01 mag .",
    "since all three cmds presented in section 2 above suggests that the a component lies very close to the dwarf main sequence , we estimate the mass for it from currently available empirical mlrs . as discussed by delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the current mlrs for near - infrared ( jhk ) bandpasses all show small observational dispersion and agree well with the predictions of the bcah98 models whereas the m@xmath2 versus mass mlr shows considerably more scatter and increasing deviations from the models for masses @xmath290.4 m@xmath18 . for our initial estimate of the mass for lsr1610@xmath000a",
    "we employ the delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) polynomials fits to existing observations for log[m / m@xmath18 ] versus m@xmath2 , m@xmath59 , m@xmath60 , and m@xmath30 .",
    "these relations yield a mean value of 0.095  m@xmath18 with a range of 0.0980.090  m@xmath18 .",
    "the first three lines of table 4 gives the solutions for the mass of the b component , assuming a possible range of masses for the a component as discussed above , and assuming that @xmath49(i ) = 0 .",
    "these solutions all require the companion object to have a mass near 0.06 m@xmath18 .",
    "therefore it would certainly be a brown dwarf .",
    "it likely would have a spectral type of late - t or later , a temperature below 800 k , and a luminosity below 10@xmath61 l@xmath18 , although these quantities depend on the uncertain age and metallicity of the companion .",
    "these three solutions are self - consistent , in that the low mass required for the b component ( near 0.06 m@xmath18 ) implies that it will not contribute significant light both in the i bandpass astrometric images and in the k bandpass spectrophotometric data .",
    "also included for each solution in table 4 are the predicted radial velocity semi - amplitudes for the both the primary , k@xmath44 , and for the secondary , k@xmath62 , stars .",
    "specifically , for the primary star we have , in km s@xmath5 , @xmath63 } \\ ] ] when a@xmath44 is in au and p is in sidereal years .",
    "the predicted radial velocity curve for the @xmath49 = 0 solutions combined with our astrometric orbital elements is shown in figure 6 , along with the radial velocity observations from rb06 and this paper ( see section 2.3 above ) . given the formal error estimates for the observations , the results seem to be self - consistent . while better definition of the observed radial velocity curve is certainly doable , it will require significant effort on a keck class telescope .",
    "solutions were then carried out with @xmath49(i ) = 0.05 and 0.10 , corresponding to a pair where i@xmath53@xmath0i@xmath54@xmath43.2 mag and 2.4 mag , respectively .",
    "these solutions require the b component to have a higher mass in the range 0.07 - 0.08 m@xmath18 in order to compensate for the increased semi - major axis of the relative orbit necessary to maintain the observed semi - major axis of the photocentric orbit",
    ". then it would be near the star / brown dwarf boundary and could be either .",
    "the absolute magnitudes given in table 4 for @xmath64 and 0.10 are similar to those for 2m0532 + 82 ( burgasser et al . 2008 ) , and our required mass for lsr1610@xmath000b is consistent with the mass ( 0.074 - 0.082 m@xmath18 ) that burgasser et al .",
    "estimated for 2m0532 + 82 .",
    "one possible concern is that objects like 2m0532 + 82 have @xmath65 colors redder than lsr1610@xmath000a , leading to the companion contributing more light at @xmath66 ( and probably at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , depending on its @xmath69 color ) . as discussed above ,",
    "evidence for a composite infrared spectrum is not compelling .",
    "with present available data , however , these solutions can not be ruled out .",
    "finally , solutions were attempted for a selection of @xmath49(i ) greater than 0.10 .",
    "the @xmath49(i ) = 0.15 case corresponds to a pair where i@xmath53@xmath0i@xmath54@xmath41.9 mag .",
    "solutions with @xmath70 appear to be incompatible with the observed parallax and absolute magnitudes ; as @xmath49 is increased , the semi - major axis of the primary star becomes larger , the masses of both components must become larger to keep the orbit bound , and the high masses become inconsistent with any reasonable mass - luminosity relation and the observed absolute magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we believe these possibilities are excluded .    for all the acceptable solutions given in table 4 , the sum of the semi - major axes of the two stars is 0.70.8 au . allowing for",
    "the observed eccentricity of the orbits , the separation between the two stars is 0.40.8 au .",
    "this separation is sufficiently large that mass transfer can not be occuring now and would not have occured in the past unless through a phase of common envelope evolution .",
    "the distances determined in this paper for lsr1425 + 71 and lsr1610@xmath000 , together with radial velocities , allow calculation of their space velocities and orbits through the galaxy . as mentioned in sec .",
    "2 , the large negative v velocity for both stars is strongly indicative of a halo origin for both . to calculate their orbits , we modeled the orbits in three potentials , two extreme cases ( a keplerian point mass , and a pseudo - isothermal sphere ) , and a quasi - realistic model ( that of dauphole and colin 1995 , which is made up of three miyamoto - nagai components , representing the bulge , disk and halo ) .",
    "the orbits were integrated using a bulirsh - stoer integrator . following kerr & lynden - bell ( 1986 ) ,",
    "the solar radius was presumed to be 8.5 kpc , and the circular velocity of the lsr @xmath71 km s@xmath5 . the solar motion with respect to the lsr @xmath72 km s@xmath5 , where @xmath73 points radially outward ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) . energy was conserved at better than one part in @xmath74 over the integrations .",
    "integrations were run backwards in time for up to @xmath75 years , in steps of @xmath76 years .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show the orbits in the dauphole & colin ( 1995 ) potential for the past @xmath77 years .    for both stars , in all cases ,",
    "the orbits are quite eccentric ( @xmath78 , and typically closer to @xmath79 ) , highly inclined with respect to the galactic plane ( @xmath80 ) , have periods of roughly 100 myr , and apo - galactica near the solar orbital radius . in both cases ,",
    "the orbits are largely radial and variably vertical , with only a very modest amount of rotational motion in the @xmath81 plane .    for lsr  1610@xmath000",
    ", the peri - galacticon distance ranges from 140  pc in the dauphole & colin model up to 1,460  pc for a simple pseudo - isothermal halo model ( with a nice broad core ) . for lsr  1425 + 71 ,",
    "the peri - galacticon passage radii are 300  pc and 2030  pc , respectively .",
    "the total space velocities at peri - galacticon passages for the dauphole & colin model are 650 and 610 km s@xmath82 for lsr1610@xmath000 and lsr1425 + 71 , respectively . given how close both stars come to the galactic center , it is quite likely that both have undergone significant scattering within the last few orbital periods",
    ". given the very small peri - galacticon distances ( particularly for lsr1610@xmath000 ) , we felt it useful to assess the impact of the massive black hole at the galactic center on the stellar orbits .",
    "we added a point mass component , of @xmath83 m@xmath18 to the dauphole & colin model .",
    "qualitatively , the results were the same .",
    "the highly inclined and eccentric nature of the orbits as seen now would argue that they are not originally disk stars , as the change in angular momentum would be quite substantial .",
    "also , the fact that the orbital apo - galactica are near the solar radius would argue that they are not recent products of the far outer halo .",
    "previously , both cv06 and rb06 have used extensive spectroscopic data to conclude that lsr1610@xmath000 appears peculiar ( even `` schizophrenic '' ) , but it is most likely to be mildly metal - poor with some elements ( particularly enhanced aluminum ) indicating an unusual composition .",
    "the absolute magnitudes and colors found in this paper support the idea that it is near solar metallicity , although the uniquely red b@xmath0v color may be another indicator of unusual composition . however , the revised distance in this paper and the space velocity and galactic orbit shown in sec . 5 are paradoxical : the space velocity and orbit are not at all disk - like , and would normally indicate ( although do not require ) a lower metallicity than mildly metal - poor .",
    "the finding in this paper of a binary companion with a separation of less than 1 au is a new surprise .",
    "using occam s razor as a guiding principle , we might hope to relate the peculiar abundances to some interaction or mass transfer between the two binary components .",
    "the enhancement of aluminum found by cv06 is probably an important clue .",
    "halo red giants and more massive agb stars may produce aluminum enhancements due to mixing burning products of the hydrogen shell to the surface .",
    "the aluminum is produced at the expense of oxygen ( kraft 1994 ) .",
    "hence , one possible scenario that might be considered is that lsr1610@xmath000b , the astrometric companion to lsr1610@xmath000a , is a white dwarf . during the rgb or agb phase of the evolving white dwarf progenitor ,",
    "an excess of aluminum was produced and mixed to the surface . with a 1.7 year period , depending on the stellar mass",
    ", the red giant might be big enough to transfer al - enriched material to the small dwarf companion .",
    "this would result in the enhancement observed today .",
    "it appears , however , that this scenario has fatal flaws and must be discarded .",
    "the fundamental difficulty is the low mass of both components required by the binary possibilities in table 4 .",
    "white dwarf masses below 0.2 m@xmath18 have been found as companions to millisecond pulsars ( van kerkwijk et al . 1996 ) and in the sloan digital sky survey ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ) , although these are rare .",
    "what appears to be required to form a white dwarf of extremely low mass is that the companion has a separation such that roche lobe overflow occurs when the primary star is trying to leave the main sequence with only a small helium core .",
    "if this happens , the star does not become much bigger than its main sequence size before its evolution and growth of the core mass are truncated . as such , the 1.7 year period and the separation of the two stars of 0.4 - 0.8 au are too long and too large for this to have occurred .",
    "a second problem is that , even with a maximum cooling age on the order of that of the halo ( @xmath8412 gyr ) , most low - mass white dwarfs will still have a luminosity such that they will be visible in the spectrophotometry of lsr1610@xmath000 .",
    "the most stringent constraint is the observed m@xmath53  =  22.4 and b@xmath85  =  3.3 , requiring m@xmath8625 for a possible white dwarf companion .",
    "for example , white dwarf models from bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) with hydrogen atmospheres and m = 0.15 m@xmath18 reach m@xmath53  =  19.1 at a cooling age of 12 gyr .",
    "it may be possible that a low - mass white dwarf with a helium atmosphere would cool quickly enough that it could still be present and not detected .",
    "otherwise , the companion to lsr1610@xmath000a must be an unevolved , lower - mass star or substellar brown dwarf .",
    "therefore , the b component to lsr1610@xmath000a appears not to be the source of abundance anomalies in lsr1610@xmath000a .",
    "nevertheless , peculiar abundances do point toward the accretion of mass onto lsr1610@xmath000 .",
    "most notable is the enhancement of al found by cv06 , a result suggesting accretion from a massive agb star that has undergone hot - bottom - burning .",
    "some stars in globular clusters ( both giants and subgiants ) have enhanced al and na , and depleted o , indicative of external pollution by agb stars ( e.g. , sneden et al . 2004 ) . the mechanism for al and na production",
    "is believed to be proton capture by mg and ne nuclei at high temperatures at the base of the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "the most extreme abundance anomalies of this type are seen in the extreme metal - poor star he1327 - 2326 ( frebel et al . 2005 ) where c , n , na , mg , and al are seen to be strongly enhanced compared to fe , and ca and ti are mildly enhanced .",
    "we speculate that accretion of @xmath410.05 m@xmath18 of material with such strong enhancements onto lsr1610@xmath000 , which initially might have been about 0.05 m@xmath18 and [ fe / h ] @xmath872 , followed by complete mixing in the fully convective star , can lead to the star we see now .",
    "the accretion enhances all elements , making lsr1610@xmath000 mildly metal - poor , it enhances c and the c / o ratio , almost ( but not quite ) turning lsr1610@xmath000 into a carbon star and leaving most oxygen tied up in co , it enhances ti , but leaves tio slightly depleted , and it greatly enhances al .",
    "the @xmath88 bandpass includes several bands of alh , as well as mgh , sih , and cai : these bands are likely to have enhanced strength in lsr1610@xmath000 compared to most dm6 and sdm stars because of a combination of being mildly metal - poor ( strengthening the hydrides and atomic lines ) and abundance anomalies .",
    "we speculate that these ( not yet observed ) features are the cause of the unique red b@xmath0v color .",
    "the agb star proposed to be the source of mass accretion probably would have been a more distant companion in a triple system .",
    "it would now be a cool white dwarf , and must have separated from the present lsr1610@xmath000 binary when it lost most of its mass .",
    "( if it were still bound with lsr1610@xmath000 , it would now be detectable as a companion , unless it was initially massive enough to become a neutron star . ) alternatively , lsr1610@xmath000 and the agb star originally could have been part of a globular cluster when the accretion occurred , with lsr1610@xmath000 later being lost from the cluster or the cluster dissipating entirely .",
