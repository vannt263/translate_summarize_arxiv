    "the appearence of quark matter in the interior of massive neutron stars ( ns ) is one of the main issues in the physics of these compact objects",
    ". calculations of ns structure , based on a microscopic nucleonic equation of state ( eos ) , indicate that for the heaviest ns , close to the maximum mass ( about two solar masses ) , the central particle density reaches values larger than @xmath0 . in this density range",
    "the nucleon cores ( dimension @xmath1 ) start to touch each other , and it is hard to imagine that only nucleonic degrees of freedom can play a role . on the contrary , it can be expected that even before reaching these density values , the nucleons start to loose their identity , and quark degrees of freedom are excited at a macroscopic level .",
    "unfortunately it is not straightforward to predict the relevance of quark degrees of freedom in the interior of ns for the different physical observables , like cooling evolution , glitch characteristics , neutrino emissivity , and so on .",
    "in fact , the other ns components can mask the effects coming directly from quark matter . in some cases the properties of quark and nucleonic",
    "matter are not very different , and a clear observational signal of the presence of the deconfined phase inside a ns is indeed hard to find .",
    "the value of the maximum mass of ns is probably one of the physical quantities that are most sensitive to the presence of quark matter in ns .",
    "if the quark matter eos is quite soft , the quark component is expected to appear in ns and to affect appreciably the maximum mass value . in this case",
    "the maximum mass is expected to be slightly larger than the observational limit ( 1.44 solar masses of the so - called taylor pulsar @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of a large ns mass ( larger than 2 solar masses ) would imply , on the contrary , that the eos of ns matter is stiff enough to keep the maximum mass at this large values .",
    "purely nucleonic eos are able to accomodate masses comparable with these large values @xcite .",
    "since the presence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , like hyperons and quarks , tends usually to soften considerably the eos with respect to purely nucleonic matter , thus lowering the mass value , their appearence would be incompatible with observations .",
    "the large value of the mass could then be explained only if both hyperonic and quark matter eos are stiffer than expected . in particular , the quark eos should be assumed to be stiff enough to render the deconfined phase energetically disfavoured .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss this issue in detail .",
    "unfortunately , while the microscopic theory of the nucleonic eos has reached a high degree of sophistication , the quark matter eos is poorly known at zero temperature and at the high baryonic density appropriate for ns .",
    "one has , therefore , to rely on models of quark matter , which contain a high degree of uncertainity .",
    "the best one can do is to compare the predictions of different models and to estimate the uncertainty of the results for the ns matter as well as for the ns structure and mass . in this paper",
    "we will use a definite nucleonic eos , which has been developed on the basis of nuclear matter many - body theory , and two different models for the quark eos , and compare the results .",
    "confrontation with previous calculations shall also be discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : bhf ] we review the determination of the baryonic eos comprising nucleons and hyperons in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach . section [ s : qm ] concerns the quark matter eos according to the mit bag model and the color dielectric model ( cdm ) . in section",
    "[ s : res ] we present the results regarding neutron star structure combining the baryonic and quark matter eos for beta - stable nuclear matter . section [ s : end ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the brueckner - bethe - goldstone ( bbg ) theory is based on a linked cluster expansion of the energy per nucleon of nuclear matter ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 1 and references therein ) .",
    "the basic ingredient in this many - body approach is the brueckner reaction matrix @xmath2 , which is the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation g [ ; ] = v + _ k_a ,",

    "the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation for the single - particle potential @xmath9 using the continuous choice is u(k ; ) = re _ k < k_f k k| g [ ; e(k)+e(k ) ] |k k_a , where the subscript `` @xmath10 '' indicates antisymmetrization of the matrix element . due to the occurrence of @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ e : en ] ) , they constitute a coupled system that has to be solved in a self - consistent manner for several fermi momenta of the particles involved . in the bhf approximation",
    "the energy per nucleon is = 35k_f^22 m + 12 _ k , k < k_f k k|g [ ; e(k)+e(k)]|k k_a . in this scheme",
    ", the only input quantity we need is the bare nn interaction @xmath3 in the bethe - goldstone equation ( [ e : bg ] ) . in this sense",
    "the bbg approach can be considered as a microscopic one .",
    "the nuclear eos can be calculated with good accuracy in the brueckner two hole - line approximation with the continuous choice for the single - particle potential , since the results in this scheme are quite close to the calculations which include also the three hole - line contribution @xcite . in the calculations reported here ,",
    "we have used the argonne @xmath12 potential @xcite as the two - nucleon interaction .    however , it is commonly known that nonrelativistic calculations , based on purely two - body interactions , fail to reproduce the correct saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter , and three - body forces ( tbf ) among nucleons are needed to correct this deficiency . in this work",
    "the so - called urbana model will be used , which consists of an attractive term due to two - pion exchange with excitation of an intermediate @xmath13 resonance , and a repulsive phenomenological central term @xcite .",
    "we introduced the same urbana three - nucleon model within the bhf approach ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our approach",
    "the tbf is reduced to a density dependent two - body force by averaging over the position of the third particle , assuming that the probability of having two particles at a given distance is reduced according to the two - body correlation function determined self - consistently .",
    "the corresponding nuclear matter eos fulfills several requirements , namely ( i ) it reproduces the correct nuclear matter saturation point , ( ii ) the incompressibility is compatible with the values extracted from phenomenology , ( iii ) the symmetry energy is compatible with nuclear phenomenology , ( iv ) the causality condition is always fulfilled .    in order to study the structure of neutron stars",
    ", we have to calculate the composition and the eos of cold , neutrino - free , catalyzed matter .",
    "we require that the neutron star contains charge neutral matter consisting of neutrons , protons , and leptons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) in beta equilibrium , and compute the eos for charge neutral and beta - stable matter in the following standard way @xcite : the brueckner calculation yields the energy density of lepton / baryon matter as a function of the different partial densities , ( _ n,_p,_e , _ ) & = & ( _ n m_n + _ p m_p ) + ( _ n+_p ) ea(_n,_p ) + & & + _ m_+ 12m_(3 ^ 2_)^5/3 5 ^ 2 + & & + ( 3 ^ 2_e)^4/3 4 ^ 2 , [ e : epsnn ] where we have used ultrarelativistic and nonrelativistic approximations for the energy densities of electrons and muons , respectively . in practice , it is sufficient to compute only the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter , since within the bhf approach it has been verified @xcite that a parabolic approximation for the binding energy of nuclear matter with arbitrary proton fraction @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is well fulfilled , ( , x ) ( , x=0.5 ) + ( 1 - 2x)^2 e_sym ( ) , [ e : parab ] where the symmetry energy @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of the difference of the energy per particle between pure neutron ( @xmath19 ) and symmetric ( @xmath20 ) matter : e_sym ( ) = - 14 ( e / a ) x(,0 ) ( , 0 ) - ea(,0.5 ) .",

    "are strange baryons , namely , the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 hyperons .",
    "due to its negative charge , the @xmath30 hyperon is the first strange baryon expected to appear with increasing density in the reaction @xmath31 , in spite of its substantially larger mass compared to the neutral @xmath27 hyperon ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "other species might appear in stellar matter , like @xmath13 isobars along with pion and kaon condensates .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to generalize the study of the nuclear eos with the inclusion of the possible hadrons , other than nucleons , which can spontaneously appear in the inner part of a neutron star , just because their appearance is able to lower the ground state energy of the dense nuclear matter phase .",
    "as we have pointed out in the previous section , the nuclear eos can be calculated with good accuracy in the brueckner two hole - line approximation with the continuous choice for the single - particle potential , since the results in this scheme are quite close to the full convergent calculations which include also the three hole - line contribution .",
    "it is then natural to include the hyperon degrees of freedom within the same approximation to calculate the nuclear eos needed to describe the neutron star interior .",
    "to this purpose , one requires in principle nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) and hyperon - hyperon ( yy ) potentials . in our work",
    "we use the nijmegen soft - core ny potential @xcite that is well adapted to the available experimental ny scattering data .",
    "unfortunately , up to date no yy scattering data and therefore no reliable yy potentials are available .",
    "we therefore neglect these interactions in our calculations , which is supposedly justified , as long as the hyperonic partial densities remain limited . also , for the following calculations the @xmath12 nn potential together with the phenomenological tbf introduced previously , are used .    with the nn and ny potentials ,",
    "the various @xmath2 matrices are evaluated by solving numerically the brueckner equation , which can be written in operatorial form as @xcite g_ab[w ] = v_ab + _ c _ p , p v_ac |pp pp| g_cb[w ] , [ e : g ] where the indices @xmath33 indicate pairs of baryons and the pauli operator @xmath8 and energy @xmath34 determine the propagation of intermediate baryon pairs . in a given nucleon - hyperon channel @xmath35",
    "one has , for example , e_(ny ) = m_n + m_y + k_n^22m_n + k_y^22m_y + u_n(k_n ) + u_y(k_y ) .",
    "[ e : e ] the hyperon single - particle potentials within the continuous choice are given by u_y(k ) & = & re _",

    "the nucleons feel therefore direct effects of the other nucleons as well as of the hyperons in the environment , whereas for the hyperons there are only nucleonic contributions , because of the missing hyperon - hyperon potentials .",
    "the equations ( [ e : g])([e : un ] ) define the bhf scheme with the continuous choice of the single - particle energies .",
    "in contrast to the standard purely nucleonic calculation there is now an additional coupled channel structure , which renders a self - consistent calculation quite time - consuming .",
    "once the different single - particle potentials are known , the total nonrelativistic baryonic energy density , @xmath36 , can be evaluated : @xmath37 \\qquad \\\\   & = & \\eps_{nn } +   \\sum_{y=\\sgm,\\la }    \\int_0^{k_f^{(y ) } } { dk\\,k^2\\over\\pi^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times   \\left [ m_y + { k^2\\over 2m_y } +    u_y^{(n)}(k ) + u_y^{(p)}(k ) \\right ] \\ : , \\qquad \\label{e : epsny } \\eea % \\end{widetext } where $ \\eps_{nn}$ is the nucleonic part of the energy density ,   eq.~(\\ref{e : epsnn } ) .",
    "using for example an effective mass approximation for the hyperon   single - particle potentials , one could write the last term due to the   nucleon - hyperon interaction as \\be   \\eps_{ny } = \\sum_{y=\\sgm,\\la } \\left (   \\rho_y \\big [ m_y + u_y(0 ) \\big ] +   { 1\\over 2m_y^*}{(3\\pi^2\\rho_y)^{5/3 } \\over 5\\pi^2 } \\right ) \\ : , \\ee which should be added to eq.~(\\ref{e : epsnn } ) .",
    "the knowledge of the energy density    allows one then to compute eos and neutron star structure as described before ,   now making allowance for the species $ i = n , p,\\sgm,\\la , e^-,\\mu^-$. the main physical features of the nuclear eos which determine the resulting compositions are essentially the symmetry energy of the nucleon   part of the eos and the hyperon single - particle potentials inside   nuclear matter .",
    "since at low enough density the nucleon matter is quite   asymmetric , the small percentage of protons feel a deep single - particle potential , and therefore it is energetically convenient to create   a $ \\sigma^{-}$ hyperon , since then a neutron can be converted into a proton . the depth of the proton potential is mainly determined by the nuclear matter symmetry energy .",
    "furthermore , the potentials felt by the hyperons can shift substantially the threshold density at which each hyperon sets in .",
    "we have found rather low hyperon onset densities of about 2 to 3 times   normal nuclear matter density for the appearance of the $ \\sgm$ and $ \\la$ hyperons \\cite{hypns}. ( other hyperons do not appear in the matter ) .",
    "moreover , an almost equal percentage of nucleons and hyperons are   present in the stellar core at high densities .",
    "the inclusion of hyperons produces an eos which turns out to be much softer than the purely nucleonic case .",
    "the consequences for the structure of the neutron stars are dramatic .",
    "in fact the presence of hyperons leads   to a maximum mass for neutron stars of less than 1.3 solar masses \\cite{hypns } , which is below the observational limit .",
    "this surprising result is due to the strong softening of the baryonic eos when including hyperons as additional degrees of freedom .",
    "we do not expect substantial changes when introducing refinements of the theoretical framework , such as   hyperon - hyperon potentials \\cite{barc } , relativistic corrections , etc .",
    "three - body forces involving hyperons could produce a substantial stiffening   of the baryonic eos .",
    "unfortunately they are essentially unkown , but can be expected to be weaker than in the non - strange sector .",
    "another possibility that is able to produce larger maximum masses , is the appearence of a transition to another phase   of dense ( quark ) matter inside the star .",

    "unfortunately , the current theoretical description of quark matter   is burdened with large uncertainties , seriously limiting the   predictive power of any theoretical approach at high baryonic density .   for the time being we can",
    "therefore only resort to phenomenological models for the quark matter eos   and try to constrain them as well as possible   by the few experimental information on high density baryonic matter .",
    "one of these constraints is the phenomenological observation that in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies ( $ 10\\;{\\rm mev}/a \\lesssim",
    "e / a \\lesssim 200\\;{\\rm mev}/a$ )   no evidence for a transition to a quark - gluon plasma has been found .",
    "indeed , all microscopic simulations , like buu or qmd ,   that are able to reproduce a great variety of experimental data , do not need the introduction of such a transition \\cite{daniele}.   in these simulations the calculated nucleon density can reach values   which are at least 2 to 3 times larger than the saturation density $ \\rho_0$. one can , therefore , conclude that symmetric or nearly symmetric nuclear matter at a few mev of temperature does not exhibit any phase transition to deconfined matter up to this baryon density .",
    "it has to be noticed that the phase transition in symmetric matter   can occur at a substantially different baryon density than in   neutron star matter , where nuclear matter is closer to neutron matter than to symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this constraint coming from heavy - ion physics appears as an independent one , that should be fulfilled by any theory or model of deconfinement .   indeed , quark matter models can have , in some cases , serious difficulties to fulfill the constraint   ( the transition occuring at too low density ) ,   even if they produce `` reasonable \" results for neutron stars , where the transition does occur",
    ". we will in the following take this constraint in due consideration ,   and use an extended mit bag model \\cite{chodos } ( including the possibility of a density dependent bag `` constant '' )   and the color dielectric model \\cite{pirner84 } ,   both compatible with this condition .",
    "furthermore , some theoretical interpretation of the heavy ion experiments   performed at the cern sps \\cite{cern } points to a possible phase transition at a critical density $ \\rho_c \\approx 6\\rho_0 \\approx 1/{\\rm fm}^3$. this condition has to be taken with caution , since in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , quark matter is probed essentially at zero baryonic density and high temperature , at variance with the case of ns matter , where high baryonic density and essentially zero temperature are present .",

    "\\label{fig : eossym } \\end{figure } % --------------------------------------------------------------    before studying the quark phase inside neutron stars , let us first discuss the eos of symmetric matter .",
    "we calculate the eos for cold symmetric nuclear matter in the bhf formalism with two - body and three - body forces ,   as described above in section~\\ref{s : bhf}. then we calculate the eos for $ u$ and $ d$ quark matter , using respectively   eq.~(\\ref{e : eosqm } ) for the mit bag model and eq.~(\\ref{eq : eqm } ) for the cdm .",
    "the results are displayed in fig.~\\ref{fig : eossym}. the solid line represents the purely   nucleonic case within the brueckner many - body approach , whereas the different broken lines denote the results for the   various quark matter eos .",
    "we find that , in the range of baryon densities explored ,   the quark matter energy is always higher than that of   symmetric nuclear matter , independently of the model   adopted for describing the quark phase .",
    "therefore nuclear matter is the favorite state .",
    "these results have been obtained choosing $ \\alpha_s=0 $ , but we have checked   that they are not very sensitive to the value of $ \\alpha_s$.     as far as the results obtained with the mit bag model are concerned , some clarifications are needed .   in fact ,",
    "apart from a bag constant $ b=90\\;\\rm mev\\ , fm^{-3}$ , we have also used a density dependent bag parameter $ b(\\rho)$ ,   whose parametrization is the one of eq.~(\\ref{eq : param } ) .",
    "this was adopted in previous works \\cite{qm } , and we do not repeat here the motivations and the technical details .",
    "the conclusion that indeed no transition to quark matter is present below   $ ( 3,\\ldots,4)\\rho_0 $ can be considered well established .   at higher baryonic density",
    "the precise trend of the eos of symmetric   hadronic matter is surely more uncertain .",
    "a refinement of the eos could lead to a transition   to a deconfined phase at a higher baryonic density , compatible with the value extracted from the cern sps experimental data ( $ \\rho_c \\approx 6\\rho_0 \\approx 1/{\\rm fm}^3 $ ) .",
    "in particular , different sets of three - body forces and the inclusion of   three hole - line diagrams can produce indeed a stiffening of the hadronic   eos and the transition to quark matter can occur at this high density .",
    "a critical discussion on this point will be published elsewhere .",
    "however , these refinements do not affect the results in ns matter ,   since there , due to the appearence of hyperons and quark matter ,   the purely hadronic phase never reaches a density higher   than $ ( 3,\\ldots,4)\\rho_0 $ ,   and the uncertainity in the high density eos of nuclear matter   plays no role .     in order to facilitate the comparison between the different quark models   adopted in this work , it is useful to introduce in the cdm   an effective bag parameter , which describes the difference between the quark   matter energy density and the energy density of a system of free quarks of fixed mass $ m'_f$ having the same density and composition .",
    "we thus define \\be   b_{\\rm eff}(\\rho ) \\equiv \\epsilon_{\\rm cdm }   - \\gamma \\sum_{f = u , d , s } \\sum_{k < k_f^f } \\sqrt{\\kv^2+{m_f'}^2 } \\ : , \\label{eq : beff } \\ee   where we take $ m'_u = m_d'=0 $ , $ m_s'=150\\;\\rm mev$ in order to compare with the bag parameter used in the mit model .   as an alternative \\cite{buballa04 } , one can also define a bag parameter   as the `` non - quark '' contribution to the energy density , \\bea   b_{\\rm eff}'(\\rho ) & \\equiv & \\epsilon_{\\rm cdm }   - \\gamma \\sum_{f = u , d , s }",

    "in particular , we notice that the phase transition from hadronic to quark matter occurs at very low baryonic density when the cdm is used to describe   the quark phase , whereas higher values of the transition density   are predicted with the mit bag model .",

    "the star is the glendenning construction \\cite{gle , glen } , which determines the range of baryon density where both phases coexist , yielding an eos containing a pure hadron phase , a mixed phase , and a pure quark matter region . in our previous papers",
    "\\cite{qm } , we have used the glendenning construction , demonstrating that in particular the influence on   the maximum mass value is rather small .",
    "apart from that , the realization of the mixed phase depends on the nuclear surface tension , which is currently an unknown parameter .",
    "therefore , in the present work we adopt the simpler maxwell construction . for that",
    ", we construct the phase transition from   fig.~\\ref{fig : pchem_uds}(b ) , showing the pressure as a function of the baryonic chemical potential $ \\mu_b$. the coexistence region is determined by the intersection points between the hadronic ( solid line ) and the different quark phases .",
    "we notice that the phase transition occurs at very low values of the baryon density , $ \\rho \\approx 0.05\\;\\rm fm^{-3}$ ,   when the cdm is used .",
    "the transition density that we obtain is somewhat lower than the value obtained in ref.~\\cite{dragoplb96 } , where , using the walecka model to describe the hadronic eos , the mixed phase was found to occur in the interval   $ 0.1\\;\\rm fm^{-3 } \\le \\rho \\le 0.31\\;\\rm fm^{-3}$.   however , the general result that the pure quark phase starts at a rather low density is in agreement with ref.~\\cite{dragoplb96}.    the phase transition constructed with the cdm is quite different from the ones obtained using the mit bag model . in the latter case ,",
    "the coexistence region is shifted to higher baryonic density , as seen in fig.~\\ref{fig : pchem_uds}(b ) .",
    "this implies a large difference in the structure of neutron stars .",
    "in fact , whereas stars built with the cdm have at most a mixed phase at low density and a pure quark core at higher density , the ones obtained with the mit bag model contain a hadron phase , followed by a mixed phase and a pure quark interior .   the scenario is again different   within the nambu - jona - lasinio model \\cite{njl } , where at most a mixed phase is present , but no pure quark phase .",
    "\\subsection{neutron star structure }    we assume that a neutron star is a spherically symmetric distribution of   mass in hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "the presence of quark matter inside the star is required in order to reach larger maximum masses .",
    "we introduced a density dependent bag parameter @xmath44 in the mit model in order to explore the maximum ns mass that can be reached in this approach .",
    "we compare with calculations using a fixed bag constant and using the color dielectric model . joining the corresponding eos with the baryonic one , all three quark models yield maximum masses in the range @xmath45 , while predicting slightly different radii .",
