    "over the last decade , submillimeter surveys have revolutionized our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies by uncovering a population of high - redshift , dust - obscured systems that are forming stars at a tremendous rate ( e.g.  smail et al .",

    "the [ ci](@xmath52 ) line flux implies @xmath172 ( table  [ table : line - parameters ] ) .",
    "the [ ci ] luminosity in id141 , once corrected for the amplification , is therefore lower than the [ ci ] luminosities derived from the @xmath173 transition for other high - redshift sources such as the cloverleaf @xcite or pss  2322 + 1944 @xcite or other high - redshift galaxies or quasars @xcite . assuming an excitation temperature ( @xmath174 ) equal to the temperature of the dust and gas , i.e.  @xmath175 , the mass of neutral carbon in id141 amounts to @xmath176 , a result that is only weakly dependent on @xmath174 @xcite . compared to the mass of molecular gas , the derived mass of [ ci ] implies a neutral carbon abundance relative to @xmath129 of @xmath177/[h_2 ] \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] .",
    "the similarity of this abundance with the value of @xmath178 found for galactic dense molecular clouds @xcite is indicative of a substantial enrichment in id141 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath179 luminosity ratio is also a sensitive measurement of @xmath170 @xcite . for id141 , @xmath180 close to the luminosity ratio found in other high - redshift sources @xcite and indicating a high uv field strengh of @xmath181 , compatible with the analysis based on the [ cii ] emission line .",
    "the measurements available for id141 allow an estimate of the relative cooling of the carbon and co emission lines . the upper transition of [ ci ] is stronger than the lower transition by a factor of @xmath182 ( table  [ table : line - parameters ] ) , as in the case of the cloverleaf @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity of id141 in [ ci ] is therefore @xmath183 .",
    "based on the lvg model described above , the total co line luminosity in id141 is estimated to be @xmath184 .",
    "the co/[ci ] luminosity ratio is thus @xmath185 and the cooling in the co and [ ci ] lines represents @xmath186 of the far - infrared continuum , a factor of 7 lower than the main cooling line of the gas , i.e the [ cii ] transition .",
    "we have used four ground - based ( sub)millimeter facilities  the iram 30-meter and pdbi , the sma and apex  to follow up the exceptional source id141 that is the strongest 500-@xmath11 riser yet discovered in the _ herschel _ cosmological surveys .",
    "the detection of three bright co emission lines using the pdbi confirms that the source is at high redshift ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "the strength of the continuum and the intensities of the molecular and atomic emission lines of id141 suggest the source is gravitationally lensed , in line with what was already found for other sub - millimeter bright , high - redshift , galaxies detected with the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "the magnification factor is still unknown but is likely to be in the range @xmath188 as found for other gravitationally lensed smgs uncovered in the _ h_-atlas survey .",
    "the properties of the molecular and atomic gas in id141 indicate properties of a luminous ( @xmath189 ) , dense ( @xmath4 ) and warm ( @xmath190 ) starburst galaxy that are comparable to those derived for local starburst galaxies or high - redshift submillimeter galaxies .",
    "the asymmetric double profiles of the carbon and co emission lines are indicative of orbital motions in a disc or a merger .",
    "the source is barely resolved in the present data indicating a physical size that is smaller than @xmath191  kpc , corresponding to an upper limit of @xmath192 .",
    "the measurements of the carbon lines ( [ ci ] and [ c ii ] ) in id141 enable a first study of the gas associated with the pdr in id141 and analysis of the relative cooling of the carbon and co emission in this galaxy , that is dominated by that of @xmath193 .",
    "the [ cii]-to - fir luminosity ratio , @xmath194 , is larger than the one found for other galaxies of comparable luminosity and redshift , and consistent with recent findings that the scatter in the @xmath195 versus @xmath110 diagram is indeed large . with a ratio @xmath196",
    ", id141 follows the trend reported by graci - carpio et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in the @xmath195 versus @xmath197 plane , suggesting both a high ionization parameter and the fact that id141 could be a merger .",
    "the present observations underline the importance of observations done at frequencies in between 85 and 360  ghz to study the properties of galaxies at redshift @xmath198 .",
    "in particular , the lower frequencies ( in the 3 and 2  mm windows ) are essential to probe the peak of the co emission that , for such starburst galaxies , lies around @xmath199 4 to 5 , as well as the two emission lines of [ ci ] or molecules other than co such as water .",
    "follow - up observations of very - high - redshift , obscured galaxies found in future deep surveys , especially the less luminous objects , will need sensitive interferometers operating at frequencies below 350  ghz such as alma , the evla or the future upgrade of the plateau de bure interferometer ( noema ) in order to fully explore the properties of the molecular and atomic gas in starburst galaxies that were active when the universe was about 1  gyr old .",
