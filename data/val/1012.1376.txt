    "the surface magnetic field strength @xmath0 of a pulsar is conventionally estimated by matching the rotational energy loss rate with the magnetic dipole radiation rate , that is , @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inertial moment , @xmath4 is the stellar radius , @xmath5 is the spin period , and @xmath6 is the time derivative of the spin period .",
    "the precision of this approximation is only at the order of magnitude level because actual energy loss is not well described by magnetic dipole radiation in a vacuum . a more realistic model with current flows and radiation losses",
    "is required , but has not yet been established .",
    "a simple estimate provides @xmath7 g for typical radio and x - ray pulsars , and @xmath8-@xmath9 g for magnetars , although the level of the approximation must be noted .",
    "dynamo action in a rapidly rotating proto - neutron star with @xmath10 ms is proposed as a mechanism for this amplification by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "actual upper limit of @xmath11 generated in the convective proto - neutron star is estimated as @xmath12 g , beyond which all sorts of instabilities are suppressed by strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations of dynamo action can be used to study the large - scale fields in fully convective rotating stars .",
    "for example , non - axisymmetric fields are generated in the case of uniform rotation @xcite , while mostly axisymmetric fields with a mixture of the first few multipoles are formed in the case of a differentially rotating star@xcite .",
    "the results may not directly apply to pulsars or magnetars , but suggest that the magnetic field configuration of neutron stars may not be an ordered dipole .",
    "if there are higher - order multipoles , these will also contribute to the radiation loss .",
    "the upper bounds on their surface magnetic fields are rather loose .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of the magnetic fields of millisecond pulsars .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath13 relevant to the multipole moment of order @xmath14 is limited to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is angular velocity , and the radiation of each multipole @xmath17 @xmath18 is assumed to be smaller than that of a dipole .",
    "thus , a model with complex magnetic configuration at surface @xmath19 is allowed because of the small factor @xmath20 for observed stars .",

    "these mechanisms operate on a dynamical timescale of the order of milliseconds or the cooling timescale of @xmath22 s. if the strong magnetic fields are generated on a longer timescale , some natal kick mechanisms involved the magnetic - field - driven anisotropy do not work effectively . recoil driven by electromagnetic radiation , which is operative on a longer spindown timescale of @xmath23 s , has been proposed as a post - natal kick mechanism@xcite ( see also @xcite for the corrected expression ) . in their model ,",

    "on the other hand , the typical value is small , @xmath149 km s@xmath147 , for the dipole - quadrupole model .",
    "the difference comes from the presence of radiation of @xmath116 , which causes efficient energy loss , as discussed in the previous section . nevertheless , extremely high velocity is possible for a specific configuration even in the present model .",

    "once the quadrupole field strength is fixed , the evolution of @xmath159 in eq.([evl_spin ] ) is scaled by characteristic time @xmath160 of the dipole radiation loss for the initial angular velocity @xmath161 : @xmath162 where magnetic dipole field at the surface is chosen as @xmath163 g. figure [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of @xmath164 as a function of @xmath165 . the ratio of quadrupole to the total energy loss rate , @xmath166 is also plotted .",
    "the ratio at @xmath167 is approximately @xmath168 because of @xmath169 , but monotonically decreases . at @xmath170 ,",
    "the angular velocity becomes @xmath171 and the contribution of quadrupole radiation also decreases as @xmath172 .",

    "solid line represents the linear velocity normalized by the terminal one @xmath174 , and dashed line the angular velocity normalized by initial one @xmath175 .",
    "dotted line is the radiation loss ratio @xmath176 .",
    "magnetic field strength itself is critical in most kick mechanisms . for example , @xmath177 g at the surface is required in asymmetric neutrino emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as in asymmetric magnetized core collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resultant velocity increases with the field strength because the asymmetry arises from the magnetic field .",
    "magnetars are therefore expected to have high velocity if one of these mechanisms is operative .",
    "recent observations do not support the high velocity .",
    "rather , the upper limit of the transverse velocity @xmath178 has been reported , although there is uncertainty in the value .",
    "for example , @xmath179 km s@xmath147 for axp xtej1810 - 197@xcite , @xmath180 km s@xmath147 for sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite and @xmath181 km s@xmath147 for axp 1e2259 + 586@xcite . for fast moving pulsars , psr2224 + 45 (",
    "@xmath182 km s@xmath147 @xcite ) and b1508 + 55 ( @xmath183 km s@xmath147 @xcite ) have been reported .",
    "these magnetic fields are quite ordinary , @xmath184 g and @xmath185 g , respectively .",
    "thus , there is no clear correlation between the field strength and the velocity in the present sample .",
    "the electromagnetic rocket mechanism considered in @xcite and in this paper does not depend on field strength if the spin evolution is determined from the radiation loss . in our model ,",
    "the ratio of dipole and quadrupole moments is important .",
    "the condition for high velocity is that the quadrupole field is large enough in magnitude for the radiation loss to be of the same order as the dipole field .",
    "the velocity also depends on the geometrical configuration of the multipole moments , that is , each inclination angle from the spin axis and the angle between the axes of symmetry of the moment .",
    "assuming that the directions of moments are random , and that they are equally likely to be oriented in any direction , it is found that the mean velocity with respect to the configuration is not so large , @xmath186 km s@xmath147 , for the optimized dipole - quadrupole ratio .",
    "the maximum velocity is realized for a specific configuration in which the inclination angle of the quadrupole moment is small , and the meridian plane in which the quadrupole moment lies is perpendicular to the plane of the dipole .",
    "the velocity increases up to @xmath156 km s@xmath147 .",
    "this value is slightly smaller than the maximum observed velocity of a pulsar .",
    "the configuration is unknown , and is closely related to the origin of the magnetic field , dynamo or fossil .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite reported interesting results within the mean - field dynamo theory .",
    "they argued that strong large - scale and weak small - scale fields are generated only in a star with a very short initial period , that is , the rossy number is small , and that the maximum strength decreases and small - scale fields become dominant with the decrease of the initial period .",
    "thus , magnetars may have an ordered dipole with a strong field , while some pulsars may have rather irregular fields with higher multipoles . through the superposition of higher multipoles , pulsars in general come to have a larger radiation recoil velocity than magnetars .    finally , if the kick velocity of pulsars and magnetars is governed by the same mechanism , it either should not simply depend on magnetic field , or should depend on only the configuration .",
    "the latter possibility was explored here .",
    "present argument is recognized as the order of magnitude level due to the rotating model in vacuum .",
    "further improvement of the magnetosphere will be of importance to explore the idea .",
