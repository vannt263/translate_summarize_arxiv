    "in different extensions of the standard model ( sm ) the anomalous interactions can lead to significant modification of the top quark production mechanisms and appearance of the top rare decays  @xcite .",
    "thereby , the precision measurements of the top quark properties and its production mechanisms provide a possibility to obtain an information on new physics beyond the sm . of special interest",
    "it is the study of the top quark anomalous interactions via flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .    in the sm",
    "there are no direct fcnc transitions @xmath4 .",
    "only   loop  contributions can make them possible . as a result",
    "such processes are strongly suppressed within the sm : br@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , various extensions of the sm could lead to a huge enhancement of fcnc processes  @xcite .",
    "search for the anomalous fcnc interactions of the top quark were performed at the tevatron  @xcite , hera  @xcite , and lep-2  @xcite colliders .",
    "the present constraints on the top quark anomalous couplings in terms of branching ratio ( br ) are presented in the table below .",
    "[ t3 ]    ._the present constraints on top quark anomalous couplings _ [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the best constraint on fcnc coupling with a gluon from @xmath3-collision is obtained supposing the interaction with an @xmath6-quark only . when the interaction with a charm quark is also taken into account the constraints on couplings",
    "do not change greatly but the br increases almost twice .",
    "it is explained by the small contribution of the @xmath7-quarks to proton s pdf and appearance of two decay modes of the top - quark .",
    "one also can see that the contribution of @xmath8-boson modifies the results slightly and can be neglected .",
    "finally the derived constraint on the anomalous coupling of the top fcnc interaction with a gluon and the corresponding br are given below :    @xmath9",
    "very recently at the tevatron experiment @xcite better constraint ( @xmath10 times less ) on the @xmath11 , the upper limit on the anomalous coupling of the top quark with a gluon , was obtained .",
    "nevertheless we wish to indicate that the hera results for the single top production provides the way to put the constraints on the anomalous top - quark interactions not only with a photon and @xmath8-boson , but also with a gluon !    moreover ,",
    "such analysis of @xmath3-collision ( e.g. hera data ) allows getting the limits on anomalous coupling of the top quark with a gluon and can be considered as an independent estimation of @xmath11 .",
