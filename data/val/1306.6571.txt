    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) has proven to be a very useful tool for calculating the linear response of condensed matter to electromagnetic probes .",
    "the overall features of the dielectric function are reproduced quite well , and the agreement at zero frequency in insulators is often at the few percent level .",
    "it also describes the plasmon peaks in the uv absorption spectrum and the corresponding energy loss spectrum in inelastic electron scattering .",
    "the good experience in tddft in the optical regime encourages its application to x - ray absorption , which has a rich near - edge structure that is only partially described by single - electron physics .",
    "indeed , some aspects of the x - ray response are accessible to tddft@xcite . however , other aspects , particularly the dynamics of core - hole relaxation , are beyond the scope of the theory as presently formulated .",
    "this is because the fundamental assumption that the wave function be represented by a single slater determinant is too restrictive when the core orbital is part of that determinant .",
    "the single - determinant theory can describe correlations between the core hole and the valence electron but not correlation effects within the valence space . to overcome this deficiency",

    "the equations we solve numerically are exact for the mnd hamiltonian .",
    "we will argue that they are much easier than other methods to apply to dft functionals which contain electron - electron interactions .",
    "we view the tddft as an approximation to hamiltonian many - body theory taking the wave function as a single slater determinant ( sd ) .",
    "the equations of motion may be derived from the dirac s variational principle d t = 0 by varying the wave function @xmath0 in the space of slater determinants .",

    "( [ eq : r ] ) , the evolved wave function is still largely in the ground state with only a small amplitude of excited states .",
    "this is fatal for calculating effects of the core hole excitation such as the relaxation of the valence wave function in the presence of the core hole . by considering separate determinants for the components of the wave function with and without the core electron excitation ,",
    "the correlations associated with valence electrons can be treated as well as they are in the optical response .",
    "there is no danger of violating the fermi statistics because the two components of the wave function are necessarily orthogonal .",

    "the mnd hamiltonian has the form h = h_v(c^_i , c_i ) + h_c(c^_i , c_i)c_c c_c^. the first term is the valence hamiltonian to be constructed from the corresponding kohn - sham density functional .",
