    "the apparent shortfall of planets orbiting evolved stars has been noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two possible explanations are that either the planets are absent , or are swallowed by the host star as it expands @xcite .    from 2009 to 2014 , the pan - pacific planet search ( ppps ) observed 170 southern hemisphere subgiants and first - ascent giants @xcite .",
    "the ppps targets are redder than those observed by most surveys @xcite  we have chosen stars with @xmath13 , whereas other surveys enforce @xmath14 .",
    "this color selection makes the ppps targets complementary to the @xmath15450 northern `` retired a stars '' from the well - established lick and keck program @xcite .",
    "a complete target list is given in @xcite .",
    "hd121056 ( hip67851 , hr5224 ) is a bright southern ( @xmath16 , ra 13:53:52.06 , dec -35:18:51.7 ) giant targeted by both the ppps and the express project @xcite , a similar radial - velocity campaign aimed at detecting planets orbiting southern hemisphere evolved stars .",
    "recently , @xcite announced the discovery of two companions orbiting hd121056 : a rare short - period planet at @xmath17d and an unconstrained massive outer body with an orbital period exceeding their observational baseline of 1523 days ( 4.2 yr ) .    in this paper , we present independent data which confirm both the inner planet and the planetary nature of the outer body in the hd121056 system .",
    "section  2 briefly describes the observational data and gives the stellar parameters . in section  3",
    ", we detail the orbit - fitting process and give the planetary parameters . finally , in section  4 we give our conclusions and place this discovery in context .",
    "precision doppler measurements for the ppps are obtained with the ucles echelle spectrograph @xcite at the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the observing procedure is identical to that used by the long - running anglo - australian planet search ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; a 1-arcsecond slit delivers a resolving power of @xmath1845,000 .",
    "calibration of the spectrograph point - spread function is achieved using an iodine absorption cell temperature - controlled at 60.0@xmath190.1@xmath20c .",
    "the iodine cell superimposes a forest of narrow absorption lines from 5000 to 6200 , allowing simultaneous calibration of instrumental drifts as well as a precise wavelength reference @xcite .",
    "velocities are obtained using the _ austral _ code @xcite , which has been successfully used by several planet - search programs for more than 10 years @xcite .",
    "we have obtained 22 observations of hd121056 since 2009 feb 3 , and an iodine - free template spectrum was obtained on 2010 july 4 . with @xmath16 , exposure times are typically 300 - 600s , with a resulting s / n of @xmath15150 - 300 per pixel each epoch .",
    "the data , given in table  [ aatvels ] , span a total of 1879 days ( 5.5yr ) , and have a mean internal velocity uncertainty of 4.0 .",
    "we have used our iodine - free template spectrum ( @xmath1860,000 , s / n@xmath15250 ) to derive spectroscopic stellar parameters . in brief , the iron abundance [ fe / h ] was determined from the equivalent widths of 32 unblended fe lines , and the lte model atmospheres adopted in this work were interpolated from the odfnew grid of atlas9 @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath21 ) and bolometric correction ( @xmath22 ) were derived from the color index @xmath23 and the estimated metallicity using the empirical calibration of @xcite .",
    "since the color-@xmath21 method is not extinction - free , we corrected for reddening and extinction using @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass and age were estimated from the interpolation of yonsei - yale ( @xmath26 ) stellar evolution tracks @xcite .",
    "the resulting stellar mass of 1.30@xmath190.18  was adopted for calculating the planet masses .",
    "results from this method are labeled `` method 1 '' in table  [ stellarparams ] .",
    "we also derived stellar parameters with the moog program @xcite , based on the homogeneous , plane - parallel and local thermodynamic equilibrium models ( 1d - lte ) from @xcite .",
    "the program matches the observed equivalent widths ( ew ) with theoretical values calculated based on the atmospheric model .",
    "we obtained the effective temperature by forcing a consistent iron abundance , derived from 81 fe i lines with their excitation potentials .",
    "we determine log@xmath27 by forcing the fe i and fe ii lines to give the same iron abundance .",
    "the microturbulent velocity @xmath28 is determined by requiring a zero - slope relation between the log of the iron abundance and the ews .",
    "the results from this method are labeled `` method 2 '' in table  [ stellarparams ] .",
    "we fit for the planets in two ways : first , using only the aat observations as a wholly independent check of @xcite , and then we include the published velocities for a joint solution .",
    "the 22 aat velocities for hd121056 have an rms scatter of 64 and showed an obvious trend after @xmath152 years .",
    "the trend turned over in early 2013 , and could be tentatively fit with a long - period object , though the rms scatter remained stubbornly high ( @xmath1530 ) compared to the mean velocity uncertainty of 4.0  for this bright star . due to the limited amount of data available , we used a genetic algorithm @xcite rather than a traditional lomb - scargle periodogram search @xcite .",
    "we have successfully used this technique in previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to detect planetary signals when data are sparse or when the candidate orbital periods are highly uncertain . to check the results of @xcite , we allowed both planets to take on a very wide range of orbital periods ( @xmath29d , @xmath30d ) , and we ran the genetic algorithm for 50,000 iterations , testing a total of about @xmath31 possible configurations .",
    "convergence rapidly occurred , on a solution in which the inner planet is consistent with the result of @xcite , and the outer planet has a period @xmath321650 days with low eccentricity .",
    "the best two - planet solution was then used as a starting point for the generalized least - squares program _ gaussfit _",
    "@xcite , here used to solve a keplerian radial - velocity orbit model . for the final fitting , we excluded the velocity point from jd 2456051 , as it lay @xmath33 from the model and was obtained in exceedingly poor seeing ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "the rms about the 2-planet model was 6.4 , but dropped to 3.2  after removing that point .",
    "the data and model fit are shown in figure  [ fitplots ] , and the best - fit system parameters are given in table  [ planetparams ] . since the formal uncertainties derived from the covariance matrix may be underestimated , we we also estimated parameter uncertainties using a bootstrap randomisation method within the _ systemic console _ @xcite , which generates 10,000 simulated datasets by drawing with replacement from the original data . since the chief constraint on the outer planet comes from the first data point ( at jd 2454866 ) , the bootstrap method provides more realistic ( and much larger ) uncertainty estimates , particularly for the orbital period and mass .",
    "the rightmost two columns of table  [ planetparams ] give the mean value and @xmath34 uncertainties for each parameter from the bootstrapping .",
    "we repeated the above fitting procedures , now including the 60 velocities from feros and chiron as published in @xcite .",
    "the results are given in table  [ combinedfit ] .",
    "the rms scatter about the fit for the three data sets is as follows : aat  9.26 , feros  11.02 , chiron  9.85 .",
    "this scatter is considerably higher , but consistent with the expected pulsation - induced velocity jitter , as demonstrated by @xcite for gamma cephei , a giant star of similar evolutionary status as hd121056 .",
    "the combined fit gives a near - zero eccentricity for the inner planet and a somewhat longer period for the outer planet .",
    "the bootstrap process favours a period near 2200 days ( with a large uncertainty of 486 d ) , similiar to the 2100d estimate of @xcite and statistically consistent with the shorter periods given in table  [ planetparams ] .",
    "most importantly , all the fitting permuations described in this section unambiguously confirm the presence of the 89-day inner planet and the planetary nature of the outer companion , even when accounting for the high leverage of the first observation .",
    "for any planet discovery , it is important to check for the possibility that the observed radial - velocity variations are intrinsic to the star ( or the instrument ) and not due to orbiting planets . for hd121056 ,",
    "the periods of the two signals ( 89 and @xmath151700 days ) are nowhere near the window function peak at @xmath1521 days , nor are they near one year .",
    "spurious periods in observational data most commonly arise at those periods due to sampling ( imposed by the lunar cycle and yearly observability of a given target ) .",
    "we also note that there are no large phase gaps in the data ( figure  [ fitplots ] )  such gaps would also cast doubt on the reality of a signal .",
    "there are also no potentially contaminating background objects within 5 arcminutes of hd121056 .",
    "the chromospheric activity index @xmath35 , determined from observations of the caii h and k lines , is a critically important measurement for radial - velocity planet detection , as the star s activity is usually correlated with velocity variations that can mimic the reflex velocities induced by orbiting planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the @xmath35 index was not correlated to their velocities , supporting the planet hypothesis . for radial - velocity detected planets ,",
    "a major concern is that the signal is due to rotational modulation of starspots .",
    "for some stars , particularly giants , spots can induce quasi - periodic velocity variations in excess of 20  @xcite . for a spotted star",
    ", the rotation period can be deduced from photometry ; @xcite found no significant periodicities in _ hipparcos _ photometry , and no correlations between the radial velocities and the line profiles as measured in the bisector velocity span and the cross - correlation fwhm .",
    "following @xcite , we can combine the available estimates of the star s radius and v  sin  @xmath36 ( table  [ stellarparams ] ) minimum rotational velocity to obtain a maximum rotation period .",
    "this calculation yields a _",
    "maximum _ rotation period of 167@xmath1983 days , which is distinctly different from either candidate planet s orbital period .",
    "furthermore , if the 89-day signal were caused by spots , it seems exceedingly unlikely that one or more starspots would persist so coherently over the 5.5 years of our observations such that we detect the clean and well - sampled signal presented here ( figure  [ fitplots ] ) .",
    "these lines of evidence lead us to conclude that the simplest explanation for the observed highly significant and coherent radial - velocity variations is the gravitational influence of two orbiting giant planets .",
    "there is a growing body of recent work calling for the rigorous dynamical stability testing of proposed multiple - planet systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed dynamical testing can confirm or refute the orbital configurations inferred from keplerian fits , and hence is a valuable part of the discovery process .",
    "in many cases , when the planets proposed are relatively tightly packed , dynamically speaking , the only way to address the question of their stability is to run large scale suites of dynamical simulations , such as those presented in @xcite . in some cases , however , the proposed planets are so widely spaced that it is highly unlikely that they would interact with one another sufficiently strongly to disrupt the system .",
    "such planets are essentially decoupled from one another ( e.g.  hd159868b , c : wittenmyer et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "@xcite found that , for planets moving on orbits with low eccentricity and inclination , two planet systems are typically stable when the orbits of the planets are separated by more than @xmath37 times their mutual hill radius , where the mutual hill radius is defined as :      @xcite tested this using numerical integrations , and confirmed that this result holds , in general .",
    "as such , this seems a reasonable first criterion by which the potential stability of which a given two - planet system can be considered .",
    "clearly , the greater the separation of a given two planet system , measured in hill radii , the more likely it is to be truly dynamically stable .    in the case of the hd121056 system ,",
    "equation ( 1 ) reveals that the mutual hill radius of the two planets proposed in this work is @xmath390.265 au . the orbits of the planets are thus separated by @xmath159.6 mutual hill radii - far more widely spaced than the @xmath40 stability criterion of @xcite .",
    "indeed , the planets are sufficiently widely spaced that the system is likely to have dynamical room for at least one additional planet between their orbits .",
    "our aat data , with a residual rms scatter of only 3.2 , can be used to place reasonably tight limits on the presence of any undetected planet . in brief , we add the keplerian velocity signal of a fictitious planet to the residuals of our fit , and attempt to recover it via a generalized lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite . here",
    ", we have assumed circular orbits ; for each combination of period @xmath41 and radial - velocity semiamplitude @xmath42 , we tried 30 values of orbital phase .",
    "a planet is deemed detectable if 99% of orbital configurations at a given @xmath41 and @xmath42 are recovered with a false - alarm probability @xcite of less than 1% .",
    "this approach is essentially identical to that used in our previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the aat - only fit residuals , we can with 99% confidence exclude planets with m  sin  @xmath43  on circular orbits between the orbital excursions of the two planets ( @xmath44au ) . including all available data as in  3.2",
    ", we obtain a mass limit of m  sin  @xmath45 .",
    "further observations over additional orbital cycles of the outer planet will substantially improve the quality of the 2-keplerian fit and better constrain the region between the planets .",
    "we have independently confirmed the existence of a system of two giant planets orbiting the k0 giant hd121056 @xcite .",
    "such confirmation is essential as the system hosts a close - in planet ( @xmath5au ) , a rarity among giant stars .",
    "the longer baseline of our data also confirm the planetary nature of the outer companion proposed by @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of the hd121056 system makes it stand out from the growing crowd of planets known to orbit evolved stars .",
    "only six multiple - planet systems have been found around giant stars : hd4732 @xcite , hd200964 and 24 sex @xcite , kepler-391 @xcite , kepler-56 @xcite , and bd+20  2457 @xcite .",
    "however , the latter system has been shown to be dynamically unstable @xcite , casting doubt on its veracity .",
    "if we consider the surface gravity log  @xmath27 as a proxy for the degree to which a star has evolved off the main sequence , hd121056 is the most - evolved star to host a multiple - planet system ( figure  [ theymightbegiants ] ) . with this in mind",
    ", the lower eccentricity for hd121056b found by the combined fit ( table  [ combinedfit ] ) seems more physically plausible , arising from tidal circularization interactions with the expanding host star .",
    "the fate of planets as their host stars evolve have been modeled in detail ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unsurprisingly , at @xmath46au , hd121056b is doomed to be engulfed .",
    "the fate of hd121056c is less clear : models by @xcite show that for a 1  star , planets beyond @xmath473 au are likely to survive the asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a 5  planet must have @xmath483.7au to avoid tidal capture in the red - giant phase .",
    "@xcite likewise find the minimum orbital distance for survival to be @xmath152.6au , increasing for eccentric planets .",
    "the significant uncertainties in the eccentricity and semimajor axis of hd121056c mean that its fate rests on a knife edge , to be crystallised by future observations refining its orbit .",
    "the ppps aimed to explore the dependence of planetary system properties on host - star mass by improve the detection statistics for intermediate - mass stars ( 1.5 - 3.0 ) .",
    "many of the other programs listed in  1 are likewise targeting evolved stars to explore the same parameter space  though the masses of such stars have been put into question ( * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. ) . while hd121056 is most likely a near - solar - mass star ( table  [ stellarparams ] ) , its two super - jovian mass planets are characteristic of those planets orbiting higher - mass stars .",
    "that is , planets orbiting stars more massive than the sun tend to be more massive @xcite and move on more circular orbits @xcite .    by good fortune ,",
    "our data for hd121056 sampled the inner planet s phase well enough to enable secure detection with relatively few observations .",
    "@xcite were able to obtain high - cadence chiron observations to confirm the inner planet .",
    "this example highlights the need for high - cadence monitoring of evolved stars to determine whether the deficit of close - in planets ( e.g. figure  [ theymightbegiants ] ) is real or an observational bias arising from highly competitive and sparsely - scheduled time on large telescopes .",
    "dedicated exoplanet observatories such as the automated planet finder @xcite or minerva @xcite are the way forward .",
