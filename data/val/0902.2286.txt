    "the main purpose of the present paper is to compare two approaches to the study of dynamics of the periodic box - ball systems ( pbbs for short ) of type @xmath1 due to kuniba ",
    "takenouchi @xcite ( ktt for short ) and mada  idzumi  tokihiro @xcite ( mit for short ) .",
    "our main result states that @xmath2 the approach developed in @xcite is based on the theory of the rigged configurations ( rc for short  for details concerning the rc - bijection , see e.g. @xcite ) , whereas the approach developed by @xcite is based on the 10-elimination procedure .",
    "to be more specific , our main result describes precisely interrelations between the 10-elimination algorithm and the rc - bijection in the case under consideration .",
    "_ brief history . _ the box - ball systems ( bbs for short ) have been introduced by takahashi ",
    "satsuma in 1990 @xcite during their study of cellular automaton and attempts to construct examples of those which have a solitonical nature . the periodic version of bbs , pbbs ,",
    "was then introduced in @xcite . from that time",
    "the bbs were extensively studied since many deep and unexpected connections with different branches of mathematics and mathematical physics were discovered . among those are connections with the theory of crystal base @xcite , combinatorics @xcite , the riemann theta functions @xcite , tropical algebraic geometry @xcite , and also with the theory of discrete kp and toda type integrable systems @xcite .    the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section [ sec:10elimination ]",
    ", we briefly recall the 10-elimination procedure . in section [ sec",
    ": rc - ktt ] , we recall the rigged configuration and initial value problem of the pbbs in terms of the rc - bijection . in section [ sec : main ] , we give a precise interpretation of the 10-elimination in terms of the rc - approach ( theorem [ th : main ] ) .",
    "a state of the pbbs is given by a sequence of integers 0 and 1 on a circle .",
    "we usually cut the circle at a suitable position to be determined below and treat it as a sequence on a straight line which we call a path . in this paper",
    ", we always assume that within each path , the number of letters 0 is equal to or bigger than the number of letters 1 .",
    "we will call such paths as positive weight paths . due to the second paragraph of section 3.3 of @xcite , this assumption does not result in loss of generality .",
    "originally , a path is identified with a sequence of capacity one boxes , and 0 stands for a vacant box and 1 stands for a ball within the box . given a path @xmath3",
    ", we introduce 10-elimination procedure and notion of 0-solitons @xcite .",
    "input of the 10-elimination procedure is a path @xmath3 and output is a finite sequence of paths @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 defined recursively as follows .",
    "suppose that we have constructed @xmath8 .",
    "we give coordinate 1 , 2 , 3 , @xmath7 , to each letter in @xmath8 from left to right .",
    "the 10-pair is a neighboring pair of 10 where 1 at location @xmath9 and 0 at location @xmath10 for some @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath11 is obtained by erasing all 10-pairs of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath11 does not contain letter 1 for some @xmath12 , stop the procedure .",
    "let the number of 10-pairs in @xmath11 be @xmath13 . by definition , we have @xmath14 .",
    "then we denote distinct lengths of rows of the transposed diagram @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 and denote the multiplicity of @xmath16 by @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19    position of the cut of the original circle is determined by the following condition .",
    "note that to each letter in @xmath11 , we can specify the original position of @xmath3 from which the letter is originated . for a 10-pair in some @xmath11",
    ", we join the corresponding 1 and 0 in @xmath3 by arc in this direction .",
    "since the path is a positive weight path , we can always choose a suitable cyclic shift so that no such arc cross the left or the right end of @xmath3 .",
    "in the sequel we assume that the path @xmath3 is cut with this property .    given a path @xmath3",
    ", we draw all possible arcs according to the procedure in the last paragraph .",
    "then one step time evolution of the path @xmath3 is obtained by replacing all connected 1 and 0 by 0 and 1 , respectively , and leaving non - connected letters unchanged .",
    "we denote the resulting time evolved path by @xmath20 .    finally , we introduce a notion of 0-solitons . as we have seen , 10-pairs of @xmath8 are erased in @xmath21 . in the following diagram , @xmath22 10-pairs between @xmath23 and @xmath24 are erased : @xmath25 under this setting ,    1 .   if @xmath26 , then there are @xmath27 0-solitons at position @xmath23 of @xmath21 , 2 .   if @xmath28 , then there are @xmath29 0-solitons at position @xmath23 of @xmath21",
    ".    we can grasp the meaning of the 0-soliton if we consider the inverse procedure to get @xmath8 from @xmath21 : 0-solitons give information about how many extra 10-pairs should be inserted between @xmath30 to get @xmath8 . here , notice that if @xmath28 , it is guaranteed that there is at least one 0-soliton between @xmath30 in @xmath8 so that we have no need to specify it .",
    "based on this observation , we see that there are precisely @xmath18 0-solitons at @xmath31 .",
    "denote the positions of 0-solitons of @xmath31 by @xmath32 as we will see , the data @xmath16 combined with @xmath33 provide sufficient information to solve initial value problem of the pbbs .",
