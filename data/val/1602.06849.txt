    "the occurrence of continuities in the behavior of two - neutron separation energies describe a second - order shape - phase transition between spherical and @xmath224 rotor limits @xcite.in due to , we have investigated the evolution of two - neutron separation energies along the ru , rh , zn and cu isotopic chains by both experimental and theoretical values , which have been presented in fig.[fig:15 ] and fig.[fig:16 ] .",
    "two - neutron separation energies for even - even and odd - even nuclei defined by@xcite @xmath225 @xmath226 where @xmath227 denotes the binding energy .",
    "it can be shown that if supersymmetry applies , the separation energies in even - even and odd - even nuclei should be linear functions of @xmath7 as@xcite @xmath228 using the @xmath229 empirical values for these isotopic chains @xcite we have extracted @xmath230 mev and @xmath231 mev for ru - rh and zn - cu supermultiplets , respectively .",
    "then , we obtained the two - neutron separation energies , which are shown in fig.[fig:15 ] and fig.[fig:16 ] , together with the experimental values .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fig:15 ] and fig.[fig:16 ] that exist continuities ( linear variation ) in the behavior of two - neutron separation energies thus the phase transition for ru , rh , zn and cu isotopic chains is of second order and also approximately equal slopes for ru(zn ) even - even and rh(cu ) odd - mass nuclei is a result of supersymmetry scheme .",
    "our result confirmed the predictions of done in refs .",
    "[ 1,2,4,52 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed exactly - solvable supersymmetry richardson - gaudin ( r - g ) model for transitional region .",
    "we apply supersymmetry ideas to the description of even and odd nuclei and display that several states in many nuclei can be explained by schemes based on the u(6/2 ) and u(6/4 ) supergroups .",
    "we have employed the nuclear supersymmetry approach for description of the transitional region between spherical and gamma -unstable phase shape in addition to dynamical symmetry limits in one chain isotopic .",
    "key observables of phase transition such as level crossing , expectation values of the d - boson and fermion number operator were calculated .",
    "new experimental data on the even - mass ruthenium and the odd - mass rhodium isotopes and zn - cu supermultiplets were used to test the predictions of the new supersymmetry scheme in dynamical symmetry limits and transition region and performed an analysis for these isotopes via a gqa - based hamiltonian .",
    "the results indicate that the energy spectra of the rh - ru and zn - cu supermultiplets can be reproduced approximately well .",
    "the observables such as the energy ratios , the b(e2 ) values that are most sensitive to the u(5)-o(6 ) structural transition were calculated and compared with the available experimental data .",
    "our results show that the rh - ru and zn - cu supermultiplets have gamma - unstable rotor features but the vibrational character is dominant and also @xmath220 and @xmath221 supermultiplets are as the best candidates for @xmath232 transition .",
