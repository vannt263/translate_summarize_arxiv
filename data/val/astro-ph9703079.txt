    "at present there is strong evidence , based on stellar kinematics and gas dynamics , for the existence massive black holes in the centers of most nearby galaxies ( rees 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "one of the signatures of a @xmath3 black hole in a galactic core is that stars on nearly radial orbits would be tidally disrupted by the black hole every @xmath4 .",
    "the impact parameter required for the disruption of solar  type stars is small , @xmath5 schwarzschild radii , where @xmath6 is the black hole mass . as a result of the disruption process , about half of the stellar mass remains bound .",
    "after the first passage of the star , the debris forms an elongated stream of gas which later spreads out , intersects itself , and dissipates its orbital kinetic energy into heat ( lacy , townes , & hollenbach 1982 ; rees 1988 ; evans & kochanek 1989 ; canizzo , lee , & goodman 1990 ; laguna et al .",
    "because of the large range of densities and distance scales involved , the details of this supersonic dissipation process are , by and large , still uncertain ( for recent discussions , see khokhlov , novikov , & pethick 1993 ; kochanek 1994 ; frohlov et al .",
    "generally , one expects the dissipation of the orbital energy to last several dynamical times ( @xmath7 months ) and to eventually arrange the gas in an optically  thick cloud around the black hole .",
    "since much of the debris is marginally bound , the dissipation of orbital energy heats the gas close to its virial energy . near pericenter",
    ", shocks may organize the high entropy debris into a thick rotating torus , which would be dominated by radiation pressure ( rees 1988 ) . in this process",
    "some material is ejected out of the orbital plane . further away from pericenter",
    ", rotation is less important and the strong radiation pressure , could disperse the marginally bound gas into a quasi  spherical configuration .",
    "the accretion of gas from the bound debris cloud onto the black hole releases energy in radiation and defines the observable signature of this event . for the purpose of designing observing strategies for tidal disruption events , it is of fundamental importance to know the expected luminosity and spectral band of the resulting radiation .    a radiation ",
    "pressure dominated torus which accretes onto a massive black hole , is expected in its simplest form to produce mostly uv photons with energies @xmath8 , and relatively little flux ( with a bolometric correction of @xmath77 mag ) in the optical band ( ulmer 1997 ) .",
    "based on this fact , one might conclude that _ optical _ detection of disruption events is a difficult task . in this paper",
    "we show , however , that much of the radiation emitted by the inner torus could be processed through a surrounding gaseous envelope , and finally be seen by an external observer in the optical band .",
    "if the torus shines near the eddington limit , then the infall of gas from the surrounding debris cloud would be moderated by radiation pressure .",
    "the hard uv radiation produced in the torus would then be processed through a thick layer of gas , degraded to low photon energies , and eventually emitted from a photosphere in the optical  uv band .",
    "since the disrupted star was initially on a nearly radial orbit , the angular momentum of its debris has little dynamical significance at large radii , where much of the marginally  bound envelope resides .",
    "the outer geometry of the envelope would therefore be close to spherical , whereas its base near the torus would deviate from sphericity due to rotation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the conversion of debris mass into radiation in the torus would fuel the surrounding envelope , in much the same way as nuclear reactions energize stellar interiors .",
    "at the same time , the luminosity of the torus would be controlled by its feeding rate from the surrounding envelope as long as the envelope contains most of the debris mass . under these circumstances ,",
    "the surrounding envelope might approach a steady state , in which the interplay between gravity and radiation pressure provides a stabilizing feedback ; a fluctuation which increases the luminosity above the eddington limit would result in an outflow and hence reduce the accretion luminosity , while a sub  eddington fluctuation would increase the infall rate and hence bring the luminosity back to its equilibrium value ( cowie , ostriker , & stark 1978 ) .",
    "the structure of such an envelope is simplified by the fact that a fully ionized gas which is dominated by thomson opacity and radiation pressure tends to approach a uniform entropy state . since gravity is fixed by the massive black hole , the envelope",
    "will then obtain a universal ( polytropic ) density profile .",
    "the observed properties of this envelope will depend only on the masses of the black hole and the debris .",
    "furthermore , the eddington luminosity depends solely on the black hole mass , and if an approximate distance were known to the source , ( e.g. through a redshift ) , then the black hole mass could be measured .",
    "the geometry of the above cofiguration is similar to that of a thorne - ytkow object ( to , thorne & ytkow 1975 ) , which is a red supergiant with a neutron star core .",
    "however , there are a number of important physical differences between the systems . in the envelope we consider ,",
    "the gravitational force is fixed by the central point mass whereas the envelope of a to provides most of its total mass .",
    "secondly , the interior temperatures and densities in our models are not sufficiently high to produce pairs or significant nuclear fusion , as is the case for tos with envelopes more massive than @xmath9 .",
    "our envelopes are powered by gravitational energy , more similarly to low mass tos .",
    "the existence of a steady , spherical , optically  thick envelope around the black hole should be regarded as the most optimistic expectation for the optical appearance of a disruption event .",
    "our model can therefore be used to motivate searches for the most luminous disruption events in the local population of galaxies .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we derive the universal density profile and effective temperature of an eddington envelope around a massive black hole .",
    "we examine the self  consistency condition for the existence of this steady state and estimate its lifetime .",
    "we show that the required radiative efficiency can naturally be supplied by an accreting torus near the black hole .",
    "section 3 examines the observational signatures of the eddington envelopes . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "we consider the envelope of high  entropy gas that might form around a massive black hole of mass @xmath6 as a result of the tidal disruption of a star .",
    "the envelope is dominated by thomson opacity , because at its characteristically low densities ( @xmath10 g  @xmath11 ) , the bound  bound , bound ",
    "free , and free  free opacities are relatively unimportant ( lamers & burger 1989 ) .",
    "we denote the mass of the stellar debris that is bound to the black hole by @xmath12 ( @xmath7 half of the initial mass of the star ) .",
    "our underlying assumption is that the cooling time of the bound gas is much longer than its dynamical time , so that the envelope relaxes to a steady  state configuration .",
    "consistency of this assumption will be demonstrated later .",
    "we also assume that radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure , because of the high temperature achieved through dissipation of the orbital energy of the marginally bound debris . based on the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative transfer , steady radiative envelopes of this type",
    "must have a constant ratio of gas pressure to total pressure or a uniform entropy ( eddington models ) . with radiation domination and uniform entropy , the radiation pressure , @xmath13 ,",
    "is expressed in terms of the mass density of the gas @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16const is related to the entropy of the gas . the hydrostatic equilibrium equation",
    "@xmath17 admits the solution , @xmath18 the total mass of the envelope is then , @xmath19 and so we may write @xmath20{1\\over r^3 } , \\label{eq:5}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the inner and outer radii of the envelope .",
    "we set the inner radius to be of order the pericenteric radius for the parent star orbit .",
    "the condition for tidal disruption implies , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial radius of the disrupted star .",
    "the exact value of @xmath22 is of little importance since it enters only logarithmically into our final results .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) holds only out to the radius where the radiation is trapped , and so we associate the outer radius of the envelope with the photospheric condition , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the thomson cross  section , @xmath27 is the proton mass , and @xmath28 is the mean atomic weight per electron . for a hydrogen mass fraction , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "this implies , @xmath31^{1/2}\\approx 1.7\\times 10^{15}\\left({m_\\star\\over 0.5 m_\\odot}\\right)^{1/2}~{\\rm cm}. \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] this result is only approximate , since equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) does not strictly hold past the photosphere .",
    "nevertheless , the steep dependence of the optical depth on radius ( @xmath32 ) interior to the photosphere , implies that the actual location of the outer radius could not differ much from this value .",
    "the flux of radiation at each radius is obtained from the radiative transfer equation @xmath33 and so equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) implies that the luminosity of the envelope equals the eddington limit , @xmath34    equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) ignored the gas pressure , @xmath35 , relative to the radiation pressure , @xmath36 ; to make it exact , its left hand side should be multiplied by @xmath37 , where @xmath38^{1/4 } = 10^{-4}\\left({m_{\\rm bh}\\over 10 ^ 6m_\\odot}\\right)^{-3/4 } \\left({m_\\star\\over 0.5m_\\odot}\\right)^{1/4 } , \\label{eq : beta}\\ ] ] and @xmath39^{-1}= 0.6 $ ] . as a result , the luminosity deviates slightly from the eddington limit , @xmath40 .",
    "the luminosity can also be expressed in terms of the effective temperature of the photosphere @xmath41 , @xmath42 yielding , @xmath43 the effective temperature has a very weak dependence on the mass ratio between the black hole and its envelope and is associated with the optical  uv band .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the color of such an envelope is therefore robust .",
    "the interior temperature profile of the envelope scales as @xmath44 and reaches a value @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "note that the internal energy of the envelope , @xmath47 could naturally be provided by the disruption of a star at the tidal radius , @xmath46 .",
    "so far we have ignored the angular momentum of the envelope . because the disrupted star must be on a nearly radial orbit ,",
    "rotation is unimportant at large radii , @xmath48 .",
    "however the centrifugal force could support the gas against gravity near @xmath22 .",
    "the accretion flow onto the black hole converts a fraction @xmath49 of the accreting mass into radiation .",
    "this radiation would then be reprocessed through the surrounding optically ",
    "thick envelope before it reaches the observer .",
    "energy balance implies , @xmath50    the radiative efficiency , @xmath49 , depends on the accretion configuration around the black hole , where most of the gravitational binding energy of the gas is dissipated .",
    "the envelope always shines at the eddington limit , irrespective of the value of @xmath12 , and so @xmath51const for a steady radiative efficiency , @xmath52const .",
    "we therefore obtain , @xmath53 where @xmath54 this time dependence determines the evolution of the effective temperature in equation  ( [ eq : teff ] ) , @xmath55 .",
    "the above envelope configuration could exist only as long as the evolution time @xmath56 is much longer than the system s dynamical time over which it relaxes to hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath57^{3/4 } \\left({m_{\\rm bh}\\over 10 ^ 6m_\\odot}\\right)^{-1/2}. \\label{eq:14}\\ ] ] equations  ( [ eq:13 ] ) and  ( [ eq:14 ] ) imply that our discussion is self  consistent as long as the radiative efficiency is sufficiently high , @xmath58^{-1/4 }",
    "\\left({m_{\\rm bh}\\over 10 ^ 6m_\\odot}\\right)^{1/2}. \\label{eq:15}\\ ] ] the existence of an eddington envelope relies on the fact that the intersection and dissipation of the debris streams would yield a super  eddington mass accretion rate .",
    "this is likely to be the case if @xmath59 and the black hole mass is low @xmath60 ( ulmer 1997 ) .",
    "the radiative efficiency could obtain high values only if the viscous time , @xmath61 , for the transport of angular momentum near the base of the envelope ( where most of the radiation is produced ) , is comparable or longer than the photon diffusion time out of this region , @xmath62 ( begelman & meier 1982 ) . if , however , @xmath63 then most of the radiation will be trapped and carried with the gas into the black hole , hence leading to a low @xmath49 . under such circumstances , the disk luminosity @xmath64 would be unable to support the surrounding envelope against gravity , and the distant gas will be drained down to @xmath22 , where angular momentum becomes important , on its free  fall time . to estimate the central viscous time we assume that the base of the envelope at @xmath65 is rotationally supported . by parameterizing the viscosity coefficient through the relation , @xmath66 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 )",
    ", we get @xmath67 where we have used equations  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and  ( [ eq:5 ] ) to substitute @xmath68 at the base of the envelope . for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , this yields , @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon diffusion time is of order , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the optical depth to electron scattering .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:5 ] ) and  ( [ eq:7 ] ) yield @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and the gas would develop a rotationally supported configuration near @xmath22 with a high radiative efficiency .",
    "however , for @xmath78 most of the radiation would be advected into the black hole ( narayan 1996 ) and the stellar debris would disappear within several months ; the advection would be most effective in a spherical geometry , but less so in a disk geometry for which @xmath49 is reduced only by a factor @xmath79 .",
    "finally , we note that any variability on short timescales due to thermal or dynamical instabilities near the center ( chen et al . 1995 ) , would be moderated by the long diffusion time of the photons through the surrounding optically  thick envelope .",
    "the viscosity parameter is also limited from below so as to yield @xmath80 .",
    "this requires @xmath81 , based on equations  ( [ eq:13 ] ) and  ( [ eq:16 ] ) .    for thick accretion tori with radial hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. paczyski & wiita 1980 ( pw ) ; jaroszysky , abramowicz , & paczyski 1980 ) , there is no significant advection of thermal energy .",
    "because the inner edge of the torus is pushed by pressure inwards of the marginally stable schwarzschild orbit at 6@xmath82 and brought to a binding energy closer to zero , the radiative efficiency of a thick disk is lower than that of a thin disk . using a thick disk code developed by ulmer ( 1997 ) , we investigate the minimum radiative efficiencies for a wide range of thick disks .",
    "our disks are embedded in a pseudo  newtonian potential , which is a convenient substitute for the general relativistic metric of a schwarzschild black hole ( pw ) .",
    "we assume a uniform entropy equal to that of the eddington envelope , with pressure described by the polytrope relation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we further require that the torus join the envelope smoothly so as to have radial force balance at the transition radius . under these assumptions , a radius of the last stable orbit ( which lies inside of 6@xmath82 due to pressure gradients ) and a run of angular momentum ,",
    "uniquely define the disk .    in figure 2",
    ", we show the results of a search through parameter space for the minimum efficiency disks , namely those with the inner radius closest the marginally bound orbit .",
    "we have used angular momentum distributions of the form @xmath83 in model 1 , and @xmath84 in model 2 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the keplerian angular momentum per unit mass in the pw potential , and the constant , @xmath86 , ensures that @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "all radial variables are in units of the schwarzschild radius . because the pw potential is an approximation",
    ", the efficiencies can be slightly higher ( 6.3  % ) than the maximum efficiency for a thin disk in the schwarzschild metric ( 5.7  % ) .",
    "we require that the specific angular momentum of the torus be as large as the specific angular momentum of the star before its disruption at the tidal radius .",
    "the radiative efficiencies found for this broad class of models are all significantly higher than the value of @xmath89 , required for the existence of an envelope [ eq .  ( [ eq:15 ] ) ] .",
    "the efficiencies are expected to be even higher if the black hole is spinning ( thorne 1974 ) , a generic situation for a black hole that grew through accretion from a disk ( bardeen 1970 ) .    for super  eddington thick disks , the luminosity scales logarithmically with mass accretion rate ( paczyski 1980 ) , whereas for sub  eddington luminosities , the luminosity scales linearly with mass accretion rate .",
    "consequently , the luminosity will never be highly super  eddington .",
    "if the disk luminosity falls below the eddington limit , the mass supply rate to the disk will increase , giving rise to a stabilizing feedback near the eddington limit .",
    "such a feedback is likely to be most effective when the disk mass is small relative to the envelope and the mass infall from the envelope controls the disk accretion rate .",
    "however , it is also possible that the disk will not respond quickly enough to the envelope , and that the envelope would be pushed  out impulsively by a super  eddington eruption in the disk .",
    "if sufficient energy is stored in the disk , then such an event could lift the envelope and unbind it . even under steady state conditions ,",
    "the outer boundary of the envelope will inevitably develop a radiation  driven wind , in analogy with hot stars ( kudritzki et al .",
    "1989 , and references therein ) . in this case",
    ", the wind would be accelerated by the extra radiative force at the photosphere due to atomic lines .",
    "irrespective of the details of the radiative force , the mass loss rate in the wind , @xmath90 , is limited by momentum conservation , @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( cassinelli 1979 ; but see the effects of multiple scatterings in lucy & abbott 1993 ) , @xmath93 is the terminal wind velocity , and @xmath94 is the total momentum output per unit time carried by the radiation . in hot stars with luminosities near the eddington limit , this relation is obeyed with @xmath95 .",
    "based on the previous paragraph , we distinguish between two cases : ( i ) slow wind out of a steady  state envelope [ @xmath40 ] ; and ( ii ) fast wind in a transient envelope [ @xmath97 . in both cases we scale @xmath98 . in the slow wind case ,",
    "the wind velocity is of order the net escape speed from the photosphere ( cf .",
    "figure 15c in kudritzki et al . 1989 ) , i.e. @xmath99 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) ] , leading to @xmath100 .",
    "since the wind velocity is small , the evaporation time of the envelope is limited in this case by its long crossing time , @xmath101 in the fast wind case , where @xmath102 is of order unity for a period lasting more than @xmath103 ( e.g. due to an eruption in the disk ) , @xmath104 so that @xmath105 , and the lifetime of the envelope is @xmath106 since the photon diffusion time @xmath107 is much shorter than @xmath108 , a transient super  eddington flux which lasts for several months ( @xmath109 ) due to unsteady accretion in the disk , will only ablate the outermost layer of the envelope . based on equations  ( [ eq:13 ] ) , ( [ eq : slowwind ] ) , and  ( [ eq:23 ] )",
    ", we infer that the characteristic source lifetime is between several years and several decades .",
    "an eddington envelope of a @xmath0 black hole would shine with an optical luminosity @xmath110 , comparable to the total luminosity of a bright galaxy .",
    "it should therefore be straightforward to detect an unresolved nuclear emission of this type in any galaxy .",
    "the emission events are transients with typical durations of years to decades .",
    "since the disruption rate of stars is @xmath111 per galaxy ( rees 1988 ) , a fraction @xmath112@xmath89 of all galaxies should show signatures of a disruption event at any given time .",
    "this is @xmath113@xmath114 of all seyfert galaxies ( huchra & burg 1992 ) , which are active galactic nuclei with comparable luminosities .",
    "most seyferts show a uv excess consistent with thermal emission at a temperature @xmath115k ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , well above our predicted photospheric temperature [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) ] ; this agrees with our expectation that eddington envelopes should reflect a small minority of all seyferts . the forthcoming sloan digital sky survey ( gunn & knapp 1993 ;",
    "see also http://www.astro.princeton.edu/bbook ) will obtain low  resolution spectra of @xmath116 galaxies ( and image many more galaxies in five bands ) , and might therefore find more than several hundred galaxies with nuclear activity due to a tidal disruption event .",
    "the nuclear emission from these galaxies would disappear on a timescale of years to decades , and could therefore be identified through repeated observations , analogous to those of supernova searches ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "follow  up observations with the hubble space telescope could be used to extend the measured spectra of these objects into the uv , and to confirm their low emission temperatures .",
    "since the eddington envelopes are very optically thick ( @xmath117 ) , their emission spectrum is to first order thermal .",
    "the details of this spectrum resemble those of the most luminous , extended blue supergiants ( of which luminous blue variables are a subclass ) which have luminosities approaching the eddington limit ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) . in figure 3",
    "we show results from the stellar atmosphere code atlas12 ( kurucz 1995 ) for the spectra of a nearly eddington envelope with @xmath118  k [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) ] . at a fixed effective temperature ,",
    "the lower the surface gravity , g , is ( i.e. the larger the radius is ) , the more luminous the envelope becomes .",
    "the log(g)=1.5 ( cgs units ) curve is the lowest gravity model calculable with atlas12 , and is very close to the eddington limit , which occurs at log(g)@xmath119 . at the above value of @xmath41 , low gravity increases the ionization fraction of hydrogen and weakens the balmer decrement and absorption lines relative to supergiant spectra . for eddington envelopes , g@xmath120 , and so the envelopes of more massive black holes would have higher log(g ) and",
    "higher effective temperature .",
    "although the broad band spectrum of an eddington envelope resembles that of a hot star , the lower gravity of the envelope increases the ionization fraction , and hence changes the fine details of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , the lower densities of the eddington envelope suppress bound  bound transition lines which result from atomic collisions . in reality , the spectrum shown in figure 3 might be supplemented by broad absorption lines from the fast wind ( with a characteristic velocity width of up to @xmath121 ) and broad emission lines from the broad line region of the active nucleus .    the extragalactic nature of the source can be established from the cosmological redshift of its absorption and emission features . due to the gravitational potential of the black hole",
    ", these features should also be redshifted relative to the narrow emission lines of the host galaxy . the corresponding velocity shift , @xmath122 is small but possibly detectable .",
    "this shift is somewhat larger than the spectral broadening associated with the thermal velocity of the gas at the photosphere ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "in this work we have shown that much of the energy radiated by the debris of a star disrupted by a massive black hole could be channeled into the optical  uv band .",
    "the photosphere of the debris cloud would then shine at the eddington luminosity with an effective temperature of @xmath124k [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) ] .    in this case",
    ", the disruption event would appear as unresolved emission from the nucleus of the host galaxy , marked by a thermal spectrum similar to that of a hot star but with fewer absorption lines ( fig .",
    "3 ) . if broad emission lines accompany this nuclear activity , their redshift can serve as the definitive proof for the extragalactic origin of the associated thermal emission .",
    "studies of reverberation mapping imply that the broad line region is located at a radius @xmath125 ( peterson 1993 ; maoz 1996 ) , much larger than the expected photospheric radius of the debris cloud , @xmath126 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ] .",
    "however , the existence of broad emission lines is in question , in particular because any preexisting broad line clouds might be swept away by the wind of unbound debris from the disruption event .    because a long  lived envelope must radiate near the eddington limit",
    ", a measurement of the source redshift and total flux could yield the black hole mass [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) ] .",
    "the effective temperature of the envelope could then be used to fix the mass of the envelope [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) ] . due to gravitational redshift",
    ", the spectral features of the envelope would be redshifted relative to the host galaxy by @xmath127 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) ] .",
    "we have shown that the universal solution for the steady envelope is self  consistent as long as the radiative efficiency near the black hole is higher than a fraction of a percent .",
    "this condition could naturally be satisfied by an inner accretion torus ( fig .",
    "the characteristic lifetime of the above envelope is between years and decades , irrespective of whether it is determined by the cooling time of the envelope [ eq .  ( [ eq:13 ] ) ] or by the momentum flux limit on a radiation  driven wind [ eqs . [ eq:22])([eq:23 ] ) ] .",
    "when combined with the event rate of @xmath128 per galaxy , this implies that a fraction of @xmath112@xmath89 of all galaxies might show signs of activity due to the disruption of a star in their nucleus .",
    "if our predicted optical appearance of the disruption events is generic , then the forthcoming sloan digital sky survey might find several hundreds of galaxies which show seyfert  like luminosity in their nucleus ( @xmath129 ) and have thermal spectra with an effective temperature @xmath2 k. these sources would exhibit considerable dimming over a decade of repeated observations .",
