    "the conductance gives the current as a linear response to an applied voltage for a given finite sample , specified by its atomic geometry .",
    "typically , the sample of interest may be a thin chain of metallic atoms or a single molecule attached to metallic electrodes .",
    "the usual theory for _ ab - initio _ prediction of conductances for these nanoscale devices is based on the landauer formula  @xcite @xmath1 which identifies the conductance with the transmission probability for an electron at the fermi level , @xmath2 , to penetrate the sample .",
    "given the impressive success of the landauer - bttiker equations  @xcite in many mesoscopic phenomena , many authors tried to relate it to basic principles .",
    "since we are concerned with linear response , the general kubo linear response formalism  @xcite is well suited to this purpose . among the first to do so were economou and soukoulis  @xcite who presented a derivation for noninteracting electrons .",
    "this was subsequently vigorously discussed  @xcite , since perfect transmission @xmath3 results in a finite conductance , not infinite as might be expected . eventually the debate was reconciled with the realization that that formula ( [ landauer ] ) gives the conductance between _ reservoirs _ and @xmath4 represents an unavoidable minimum contact resistance if such macroscopic electrodes are connected through a quasi-1d contact . however , there are no such electrodes in the kubo - like derivations , as has been pointed out by landauer  @xcite , and so the result remained somewhat puzzling .",
    "the argument in favour of a kubo - like derivation was an introduction of an auxiliary external field acting in the leads that compensates exactly the charge - density oscillations produced by the homogeneous field in the sample , resulting in the `` 4-point '' conductance formula  @xcite @xmath5 that relates the current to the local drop in total electrostatic potential .",
    "however , in many experiments and situations it is the 2-point conductance @xmath6 that is required , in which case formula ( [ landauer ] ) is frequently used for conductance calculations ( e.g. for nanowires and metal - molecule - metal junctions ) . therefore , clarification of the relationship of this formula to the kubo approach remains necessary , and may lead to practical advances for _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "much of the confusion arising from the `` boundary and bulk contribution to the conductivity '' introduced by the ideal leads has been clearly resolved by sols  @xcite who emphasized the importance of global charge conservation and its relation to gauge transformations . in that paper , however , only the result ( [ landauer ] ) was derived and discussed and the induced charge - density oscillations were ignored .",
    "the fundamental understanding of conductance as quantum - mechanical transmission relies on the picture of distinct electro - chemical potentials for the two electrodes .",
    "these dictate the occupation of states in the non - equilibrium sample .",
    "an alternative point of view ( equally valid but much closer to the kubo formalism ) is that of electrons accelerated in the applied external field .",
    "the ability of the field to accelerate electrons in extended or bulk materials has been used by kohn  @xcite to distinguish between conductors and insulators where conductors are characterized by @xmath7 and the case @xmath8 characterizes insulators .",
    "this point of view , but applied to conductance of finite samples or mesoscopic conductors , has been considered by fenton  @xcite who strictly differentiated between a localized external field leading  through acceleration of electrons over a finite distance  to a finite conductance and yielding the landauer formula , and a homogeneous field giving a response characteristic of the bulk material with @xmath9 singularity .",
    "an approach based on coupled self - consistent equations for the current density , electron density and induced field , implicitly also representing the `` conductance based on acceleration '' point of view , was set out in detail by kamenev and kohn  @xcite .",
    "they focus on the 4-point conductance , which they define as the current divided by _ induced _ potential drop , thereby completely neglecting the electrostatic drop in the external potential .",
    "this is appropriate in some cases , since a finite constant external field over infinitely long leads contributes negligibly to the total potential drop around the sample .",
    "it is important to note that their self - consistent field is obtained from the 1d poisson equation , i.e. a system resembling parallel planes of charge @xmath10 moving along their normal rather then electrons confined to a 1d wire .",
    "the former systems has far stronger screening behaviour then the latter .",
    "more detailed calculations by sablikov  @xcite , who also used the kubo formalism , show that the effective interaction between electrons in a 1d wire is not strong enough to screen the charge and a uniform current coexists with an induced dipole moment of the electron density in the wire .    in this paper",
    "we derive a formula for the steady - state conductance in terms of the irreducible polarization of the system of interest .",
    "our starting point is application of an external field and following the time evolution for large times .",
    "we will show that only the @xmath11 fourier component of the field influences the steady - state current because the nonlocal conductivity is a sharply peaked function of @xmath12 , eventually becoming a dirac delta function .",
    "_ the weight of this delta function has directly the meaning of conductance .",
    "_ at the same time , this singular behaviour also corresponds to the drude singularity @xmath13 if we set @xmath11 and then take the limit @xmath14 .",
    "it is interesting to note that from this point of view we can identify the conductance with the drude weight , a connection encountered in somewhat different circumstances in the conductive properties of extended systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing an interpretation of the conductance , our formula is suitable for practical _ ab - initio _ calculations . using the continuity equation",
    "we circumvent the need for matrix elements of current operator , which are in general difficult to evaluate numerically , and express the conductance in terms of the irreducible polarization at small imaginary frequency  a quantity that can be evaluated efficiently even using _ ab - initio _ methods that describe elecronic correlation  @xcite .",
    "consider a system , infinitely long along the @xmath15 direction and finite , infinite or periodic along the other two perpendicular directions .",
    "along the @xmath15 axis we apply an infinitesimally weak external electric field .",
    "the response of the system will be in general non - local in time and space , and quantitatively described by the kubo linear response theory  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the current density , @xmath18 external electric field , @xmath19 non - local tensor of conductivity , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise and @xmath23 the equilibrium density matrix .",
    "we take the form of the field as @xmath24 . introducing the current @xmath25 ( where we integrate over the surface perpendicular to @xmath15 ) and utilising our particular choice of external field",
    "we obtain @xmath26 in the steady state we are interested in the limit @xmath27 so that for the steady - state current we have @xmath28 where we have introduced the effective one - dimensional conductivity @xmath29 .",
    "the positive infinitesimal @xmath30 plays an important role for systems without dissipation , where application of a field for an infinitely long time results in the system being heated .",
    "this is avoided by introducing an effective finite ( but large ) measurement time @xmath31 . in this way",
    "we avoid the heating problem because we first let @xmath32 ( linear response ) and only afterwards @xmath33 .",
    "( identical expressions are obtained assuming adiabatic switching - on of the external field @xmath34 as @xmath35 approaches 0 from below , and measuring the current at @xmath36 , which is the more conventional point of view . )    we are principally concerned with the total current @xmath37 and not the current density . similarly , we would like to work with the bias voltage @xmath38 rather than the field itself . to achieve this",
    "we fourier - transform with respect to @xmath15 @xmath39 first , the steady - state current needs to be independent of @xmath15 , @xmath40 , as a consequence of the equation of continuity , so that @xmath41 and therefore directly also @xmath42 .",
    "second , as a direct consequence  @xcite of the linearity of the theory , the steady - state current is uniquely given by the bias @xmath43 only .",
    "this means that for two external fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 whose long - range parts are equal ( @xmath46 ) , but otherwise are arbitrary , one has to obtain identical steady - state currents .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath47 in the limit @xmath33 , i.e. it is a sharply peaked function of @xmath48 so that , based on eq .",
    "( [ i - q ] ) , it is only the values of @xmath44 or @xmath45 at @xmath11 that affect the steady current . using these observations in eq .",
    "( [ i - q ] ) we obtain @xmath49 or using the fact that @xmath50 we can also write @xmath51 this is one of the central results of this paper and directly shows that conductance is the strength or weight of the drude singularity .",
    "formula ( [ g - int ] ) can be used for extrapolative evaluation of the conductance from the conductivity at small imaginary frequencies , and since it is peaked function in @xmath52 , the conductivity needs to be evaluated for small values of these variables only .",
    "we will demonstrate this approach numerically in section [ sec-4 ] .",
    "evaluation of the conductance using equation ( [ g - int ] ) requires calculation of the fourier transform of the conductivity .",
    "the latter is , in a real - space representation , given by equation ( [ sigma - g ] ) which itself is difficult to evaluate for all necessary @xmath53 . on the other hand , substantial experience has been accumulated in calculations of the polarization @xmath54 , defined by  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a change in density due to infinitesimally weak external potential @xmath57 . to relate these two we utilize the equation of continuity integrated over the cross - sectional area @xmath58 from the definition of the polarization we have @xmath59 , where our @xmath60 is now , similarly to @xmath61 , integrated across the cross - sectional area ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 integrals in ( [ i - sigma ] ) ) . substituting the linear response formulae for current ( [ i - e ] ) and density @xmath64 , fourier - transforming into @xmath52 variables and using the fact that the external potential is arbitrary",
    ", we immediately obtain @xmath65 we note that the singular character of @xmath66 for small @xmath52 as given in ( [ g - delta ] ) does not arise fundamentally from the @xmath67 prefactor , since @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "this property is a consequence of conservation of total number of particles ( @xmath70 ) or the absence of response in density if we change the potential everywhere by a constant @xmath71 .    expressing the conductance through the polarization",
    "is particularly suited to a correct treatment of a system of interacting electrons . in the first place , it is crucial to define the conductance not as a coefficient for current dependence on the external but on the total electric field @xmath72 .",
    "the induced field @xmath73 can be obtained from poisson equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a unit vector in the @xmath15 direction and @xmath76 is a 2d reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the perpendicular coordinates . using the linear response result for @xmath77 in terms of @xmath78",

    "we obtain , after some algebra ( appendix a ) , @xmath83 where we introduce the `` _ transport part of the polarization _ '' , @xmath84 , related to the irreducible polarization @xmath85 through an equation of dyson type @xmath86 the corrections entering through @xmath87 terms in equation ( [ chi - dyson ] ) are known as local - field effects in the context of evaluation of the macroscopic dielectric function  @xcite . here ,",
    "however , it is not quite the same since @xmath88 part is included into @xmath89 whereas for the macroscopic dielectric function the sum is restricted to @xmath90 .",
    "the omission of the @xmath91 term involving @xmath92 in equation ( [ chi - dyson ] ) stems directly from the fact that it is precisely this term that converts the drop in external field into drop in the total field , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ et - e ] ) when taking into account that the drop in total field is given by @xmath93 .",
    "correct evaluation of the conductance in 3d therefore requires inclusion of these `` perpendicular '' local - field effects , included within @xmath94 but not in @xmath95 , into account .",
    "essentially , @xmath94 describes the response of the density to the effective potential , except that long - range screening of the potential in the @xmath15 direction is specifically excluded , allowing the conductance to address the applied voltage rather than the local potential drop .    for systems translationally invariant along the perpendicular directions , @xmath96 and",
    "the last term in ( [ chi - dyson ] ) becomes identically zero .",

    "the lesson from these analytical examples is that the well - known formulae for polarization can be used for evaluation of the conductance of the system , and that the limit @xmath110 clearly corresponds to the steady - state limit @xmath111 .",
    "because the conductivity is sharply peaked around @xmath71 , only the @xmath11 component of the applied field @xmath112 has an effect on the total current .",
    "this allows us to include , as a limiting case , a homogeneous field . for a system with a constant field applied over length @xmath113 ,",
    "the field itself must be @xmath114 so that we have a sufficiently small finite drop @xmath115 .",

    "this is in agreement with the point of view advocated by fenton  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no need to keep @xmath113 strictly finite ; in fact the limiting case @xmath116 can be still characterized by a finite overall conductance by taking careful limits and using properties of the dirac delta function , as mentioned above for the case of the free electron gas ( following eq .",

    "electrons that are occupying states above the equilibrium distribution have travelled to the right from the region with an accelerating field .",
    "these , during their flight through the region , gained energy @xmath118 so that they represent current @xmath119 where we sum over states with accelerated electrons , i.e. @xmath120 .",

    "while formally we have striking similarity with the usual `` two chemical potentials '' picture , it should be noted that the microscopic interpretation of these expressions is different . as can be seen from fig .",

    "we obtain the desired demonstration of the sharply - peaked character of @xmath123 by analytically continuing kamenev and kohn s expression  @xcite onto the imaginary frequency axis , @xmath124 alternatively , we can arrive at the same result using equation ( [ g - chi - ir ] ) , which explicitly shows the utility of reformulation of transport through the polarization function in imaginary frequency .",
    "a detailed derivation is given in appendix b.    we stress that this result for the _ two_-point conductance ( [ landauer ] ) of non - interacting electrons also applies to interacting electrons if the conductance is defined with respect to the total field at the rpa level of approximation . the 4-point conductance ( [ landauer4p ] ) may be formulated in a similar fashion , which , if combined with the approximate effective electron - electron interaction @xmath125 , would be equivalent to the treatment of kamenev and kohn  @xcite.(in their calculation the 4-point conductance is defined as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the self - consistent induced drop only .",

    "a striking difference between odd and even number of occupied states comes from the fact that placing the barrier of length @xmath155 in the center affects the symmetric and antisymmetric states ( at the fermi energy ) differently .",
    "clearly , the former have a much larger amplitude at the scattering potential than the latter ( which are zero in the center of the system ) and therefore the symmetric states will be more affected .",
    "this is in agreement with the conductance for @xmath148 occupied states being below that for @xmath158 occupied states . for @xmath116",
    "these two states become degenerate and the difference between odd and even cease to exist . by bracketing the exact conductance in this way",

    "this calculation is intended to be illustrative , yet it shows that the formula ( [ g - chi - ir ] ) can , in principle , lead to the correct answer even when applied to system with `` zero '' boundary conditions .",
    "we particularly believe that the use of periodic boundary conditions will significantly improve the performance of this approach for the main problem of the zero boundary condition is clearly the one - way transfer of charge from one side to the other , which introduces finite - system errors after a relatively short time , and therefore spoils @xmath141 between @xmath163 and a relatively large value .",

    "we have developed a unifying point of view of the polarization , the nonlocal conductivity and the conductance which supplies a steady - state transport characteristics of any system .",
    "we have shown that the weight of the drude singularity at zero frequency of the nonlocal conductivity , when considered in reciprocal space , directly corresponds to the conductance of the system to which we apply a field with a nonzero overall drop in potential .",

    "however , the expression will be non - zero only if the factor @xmath183 will be compensated by the energy dependence of the matrix elements , which we will confirm in following paragraphs .    in the next step we interchange the order of integrations in ( [ g - int - chi0 ] ) so that we directly evaluate @xmath184 where we interpret the singularity to be at @xmath185 .",
    "this is in fact arbitrary since , as we have pointed out in the section [ sec-2 ] , @xmath186 .",
    "an equally valid choice of singularity at @xmath187 leads to identical results .",
    "the final integrals we need to do have the form @xmath189 and of there we need to keep only those that are singular @xmath190 since in ( [ occ - fac ] ) we need to compensate the factor @xmath191 . foreseeing the delta - function character with respect to @xmath192 and @xmath193 appearing in ( [ occ - fac ] )",
    "we can directly use @xmath194 and @xmath195 , the transmission and reflection probability amplitudes at the fermi energy respectively .",
    "it is now easy to see that the singular terms are @xmath196 using these forms , together with ( [ occ - fac ] ) and the form zero temperature limit that @xmath197",
    "we directly get @xmath198 the celebrated landauer formula .",
    "recently , matsuoka and grobe [ phys .",
    "lett . * 91 * , 130405 ( 2003 ) ] developed a novel approach to calculate the transmission coefficient form zero - boundary conditions as well .",
    "our method can be used as an alternative approach . however ,",
    "in our case the method can be clearly applied to any potential while potentials considered in their work were restricted to posses an inversion symmetry ."
