    "the historically accepted shape of the heliosphere is that of a comet - like object with a long tail that is dragged downstream by the flow of the local interstellar medium ( lism ) past the sun @xcite .",
    "these early pictures , however , were based on a hydrodynamic description of the solar outflow  the solar magnetic field was assumed to play a negligible role in the overall structure of the heliosphere and its interaction with the solar wind .",
    "computational models based on the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations included the solar magnetic field as well as that of the interstellar medium and also produced a heliosphere with a comet - like shape @xcite .    on the other hand , the measurements of energetic neutral atoms ( enas ) by ibex and cassini produced some surprises .",
    "these enas travel long distances through the heliosphere without being influenced by the ambient magnetic field and therefore yield information about the large - scale structure of the heliosphere .",
    "the cassini ena fluxes from the direction of the nose and the tail were comparable , leading the cassini observers to conclude that the heliosphere was `` tailless '' @xcite .",
    "the ibex observations from the tail revealed that the hardest spectrum of enas were localized in two lobes at high latitude while the softest spectra were at low latitudes @xcite .",
    "recent mhd simulations using a monopole model for the solar magnetic field , designed to reduce the numerical dissipation of magnetic energy that arises from a conventional dipole model , revealed that the solar magnetic field was strong enough to collimate the solar wind into a pair of jets that flow to the north and south @xcite .",
    "these jets bend in the direction of the tail , pushed by the flow of the lism .",
    "the interstellar rather than the solar wind plasma flows between these jets in the equatorial region downstream .",
    "such bent jets have been seen in protostellar systems @xcite and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "astrophysical jets around massive black holes are thought to be driven by centrifugal forces that sling the plasma along a rotating helical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the jets in the case of the heliosphere are driven in the region downstream of the ts as was proposed for the crab nebula @xcite . in this region of subsonic flow ,",
    "the magnetic tension ( hoop ) force is strong enough to collimate and drive the wind .",
    "mhd models of the global heliosphere are complex and the mechanisms that control the shape of the hp , the thickness of the hs , the structure of the heliospheric jets , including the driver for the outflow , remain uncertain .",
    "the voyager 1 observations have revealed that the thickness of the hs is around @xmath1 , which is substantially thinner than expected from the global simulations .",
    "we present an analytic model of the heliosphere outside of a spherically symmetric ts where we neglect the ambient flow and magnetic field of the lism . taking the resulting heliosphere as axisymmetric and the flows within the hs as subsonic",
    ", we obtain the pressure and magnetic field structure of the hs along with the radius @xmath2 of the hp .",
    "the overall shape of the hs takes the classic form of an astrophysical jet : the flows through the ts are accelerated to the north and south by the solar magnetic field .",
    "the heliopause radius is determined by continuity : the plasma flow through the ts must balance the outflow through the jets .",
    "we present parallel global mhd simulations in the limit of zero magnetic field and flow in the lism which support the analytic model .",
    "one reason the influence of the solar magnetic field on the structure of the heliosphere is often neglected in the literature is because the pressure of the ambient plasma is large compared with that of the magnetic field  @xmath3 just downstream of the ts .",
    "we show , however , that the total plasma pressure does not control either the flows in or the thickness of the hs . the overall pressure in the hs is balanced by the pressure in the lism .",
    "it is the tension force of the hs magnetic field that controls the pressure difference between the ts and hp @xcite . to the north and south",
    "there is no tension force and this same pressure difference drives the axial flow of the heliospheric jets .",
    "thus , it is ultimately the solar magnetic field that controls the large - scale structure of the hs .",
    "we consider a simple axisymmetric system in which there is no lism flow or magnetic field and the lism is specified by its ambient pressure @xmath4 .",
    "we write down the steady - state mhd equations , including continuity , pressure , momentum and magnetic field , @xmath5",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radius in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath10 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath11 is in the azimuthal direction .",
    "these equations are solved in the hs with boundary conditions on the density , pressure , magnetic field and flow given just downstream of the spherical ts which has a spherical coordinate radius @xmath12 . at the ts",
    "we assume that the azimuth flow @xmath13 is zero and since there are no forces in the @xmath14 direction ( eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) ) , we can take @xmath15 everywhere .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) we can write @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stream function for the particle flux . taking @xmath18 with @xmath19 from eq .",
    "( [ nv ] ) , we can reform faraday s law in eq .",
    "( [ faraday ] ) as @xmath20 this equation has components only in the @xmath14 direction so taking the dot product of this equation with @xmath21 yields the constraint that @xmath22 is constant along streamlines or @xmath23 where the function @xmath24 is only a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the form of @xmath24 can be determined by the boundary conditions along the ts .",
    "downstream of the ts we take the flow to be normal to the shock , in the radial ( in spherical coordinates ) direction with a constant value @xmath25 with the density @xmath26 also constant .",
    "so , from eq .",
    "( [ nv ] ) we find @xmath27 or @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the polar angle in spherical coordinates at the shock .",
    "thus , the variation of @xmath17 along the shock is known .",
    "similarly , we know from the solutions of the parker spiral magnetic field that along the shock @xmath30 so @xmath31 is a constant and so is @xmath32 . throughout the hs",
    "we have @xmath33 turning to the pressure equation and using eq .",
    "( [ nv ] ) , we find @xmath34 so @xmath35 is also constant along a streamline and therefore a function only of @xmath17 . as before ,",
    "we can evaluate it along the ts where it is given by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 thus , both @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the hs are linked to @xmath40 and @xmath9 .",
    "we now focus on the high @xmath41 limit , which is most relevant to the hs , where the pressure associated with interstellar pickup ions dominates the magnetic pressure .",
    "specifically , we take @xmath41 to be a large parameter . in addition , since the flows are subsonic downstream of the ts , inertial forces are also small .",
    "we can therefore write the plasma pressure in a series @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "thus , to lowest order eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) becomes @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an explicit function of @xmath40 and @xmath9 through eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ p ] ) requires that to lowest order the pressure in the hs is constant everywhere and is given the value @xmath46 at the ts .",
    "the density is also a constant , @xmath26 . since @xmath38 is linked to @xmath40 and @xmath9 through eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) the constancy of @xmath45 requires that @xmath47 so that @xmath40 increases with radius outside of the ts @xcite . at first order",
    "we include the inertial terms and magnetic field in the momentum equation , which becomes @xmath48 where @xmath39 has been replaced by @xmath26 and @xmath49 .    before discussing the flows in the hs , we consider the weak flow limit of eq .",
    "( [ momentum1 ] ) so that the inertial forces in the radial direction can be discarded . in this limit the magnetic tension force in eq .",
    "( [ momentum1 ] ) causes the plasma pressure and total pressure to decrease with radius .",
    "this limit is artificial for the hs since the flow @xmath25 downstream of the ts is comparable to the alfvn speed and the associated radial inertial forces are comparable to the magnetic forces . nevertheless , this limit illustrates how the pressure in the hs varies .",
    "we do not require zero pressure gradient in @xmath50 .",
    "the pressure drop from the ts to the lism is balanced by magnetic tension in the radial direction but the same pressure drop also develops from the equator to the outflow jets to the north and south .",
    "this pressure gradient along @xmath50 drives the outward flows associated with the jets .",
    "thus , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ momentum1 ] ) from the ts outwards to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the value of @xmath54 at the ts and is dependent on @xmath50 .",

    "we will show , however , that the requirement that the mass flow into the hs across the ts balance that out the two jets constrains the pressure difference . in fig .",

    "the data is shown for @xmath59 , which as shown later is the upper limit on @xmath58 .",
    "the inner boundary of the data shown is the ts and the outer boundary is the hp .",
    "the radius of the hp peaks at the midplane and falls off with @xmath50 until @xmath60 , where it remains constant , forming the northward jet . the plasma and total pressure decrease with radius @xmath9 while the magnetic pressure increases with @xmath9 .",
    "the total pressure falls off with distance from the equator until it approaches a constant value in the jet .",
    "we will show that this pressure difference , which is a consequence of magnetic tension , drives the jet outflow .",
    "along the axis @xmath38 remains constant at @xmath46 .",
    "this shape was obtained by neglecting the radial plasma inertia , an assumption which breaks down where the straight portion of the hp in fig .",
    "[ helio_model ] intersects the curved portion at @xmath61 .",

    "we derive a bernoulli - like equation by taking the dot product of eq .",
    "( [ momentum1 ] ) with @xmath62 and integrating along the streamline , @xmath63 unfortunately , this equation does not enable us to calculate @xmath64 throughout the hs because it requires that we know the trajectory of a stream line within the hs to link the local radius @xmath9 with its position at the ts where @xmath29 is known . along the axis where @xmath65 eq .",
    "( [ v0 ] ) gives @xmath66 , since the pressure is constant and @xmath40 is zero .",
    "similarly , the velocity at the jet radius @xmath67 , can be calculated since at that location @xmath68 .",
    "we find @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
