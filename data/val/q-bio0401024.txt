    "understanding the molecular machinery that regulates development of multicellular organisms is among the most fascinating problems of modern science",
    ". today , a growing experimental record about the regulatory mechanisms involved in development is accumulating , in particular in well - studied model - organisms as , e.g. , _ drosophila _ or _ hydra _ @xcite .",
    "still , the genomic details known today are not sufficient to derive dynamical models of developmental gene regulation processes in full detail .",
    "phenomenological models of developmental processes , on the other hand , are well established today .",
    "pioneering work in this field was done by turing , who in his seminal paper in 1952 @xcite considered a purely physico - chemical origin of biological pattern formation .",
    "his theory is based on an instability in a system of coupled reaction - diffusion equations . in this type of model , for certain parameter choices , stochastic fluctuations in the initial conditions",
    "can lead to self - organization and maintenance of spatial patterns , e.g.   concentration gradients or periodic patterns .",
    "this principle has been successfully applied to biological morphogenesis in numerous applications @xcite . however , as current experiments make us wonder about the astonishingly high complexity of single regulating genes in development @xcite , they also seem to suggest that diffusion models will not be able to capture all details of developmental regulation , and point at a complex network of regulating interactions instead .",
    "the role of information processing in gene regulatory networks during development has entered the focus of theoretical research only recently .",
    "one pioneering study was published by jackson et al .",
    "@xcite in 1986 , who investigated the dynamics of spatial pattern formation in a system of locally coupled , identical dynamical networks . in this model ,",
    "gene regulatory dynamics is approximated by boolean networks with a subset of nodes communicating not only with nodes in the ( intracellular ) network , but also with some nodes in the neighboring cells .",
    "boolean networks are minimal models of information processing in network structures and have been discussed as models of gene regulation since the end of the 1960s @xcite .",
    "the model of jackson et al .   demonstrated the enormous pattern forming potential of local information processing , similar to _ direct contact induction _",
    "@xcite as known in developmental biology .",
    "more recently , salazar - ciuadad et al .  introduced a gene network model based on continuous dynamics @xcite and coupling their networks by direct contact induction .",
    "interestingly , they observe a larger variety of spatial patterns than turing - type models with diffusive morphogens , and find that patterns are less sensitive to initial conditions , with more time - independent ( stationary ) patterns .",
    "this matches well the intuition that networks of regulators have the potential for more general dynamical mechanisms than diffusion driven models .",
    "let us here therefore study interacting networks in pattern formation and in particular consider information - transfer - based processes . in @xcite",
    ", we introduced a simple stochastic cellular automata model of spatial pattern formation based on local information transfer , that performs de novo pattern formation by generating and regulating a domain boundary . in the following",
    "we will study how this very general mechanism could emerge as a result of interacting nodes in coupled identical networks , similar to gene regulation networks in interacting cells .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold : first we will explore ways to map the earlier cellular automata model @xcite , onto dynamical networks ( boolean networks and threshold networks ) , motivated by the general observation of gene regulation networks in biological development ( section iii ) .",
    "secondly , we will give a more detailed account of the basic underlying mechanism , focusing on the stochastic dynamics ( section iv ) and on how the model was developed using a genetic algorithm ( appendix ) : in section iv , the statistical mechanics of noise - induced dynamics is studied in detail .",
    "numerical evidence for a first order phase transition at vanishing noise rate is given .",
    "a master equation for boundary readjustments is formulated and solved in the continuum limit .",
    "robustness against cell flow is studied numerically and in a mean field approximation . in the appendix ,",
    "the genetic algorithm applied for identification of model solutions is explained and statistical properties of different solutions are compared .",
    "let us first motivate and define the morphogenetic problem that we will use as a test case .",
    "then we undertake a three - step approach to find a genetic network model that solves this pattern formation problem . in the first step ,",
    "we summarize the properties of the cellular automata model introduced in @xcite .",
    "cellular automata as dynamical systems discrete in time and state space are known to display a wide variety of complex patterns @xcite and are capable of solving complex computational tasks , including universal computation .",
    "we searched for solutions ( i.e. rule tables which solve the problem ) by aid of a genetic algorithm ( for details , see appendix ) .",
    "candidate solutions have to fulfill four demands : their update dynamics has to generate a spatial pattern which 1 ) obeys a predefined scaling ratio @xmath0 , 2 ) is independent of the initial condition chosen at random , 3 ) is independent of the system size ( i.e.  the number of cells @xmath1 ) and 4 ) is stationary ( a fixed point ) . in the second step ,",
    "this cellular automata rule table is `` translated '' into ( spatially coupled ) boolean networks , using binary coding of the cellular automata states .",
    "the logical structure of the obtained network is reduced to a minimal form , and then , in step three , translated into a threshold network .      a classical model organism for studies of position dependent gene activation is the fresh water polyp _ hydra _ , which has three distinct body regions - a head with mouth and tentacles , a body column and a foot region .",
    "the positions of these regions are accurately regulated along the body axis .",
    "the problem we shall focus on is sketched schematically in fig .",
    "[ hydraped ] for the example of the `` foot '' genes _",
    "pedibin _ and _ cn - nk2 _ @xcite .",
    "cn - nk2 is active only in the lowest foot region , the expression domain of pedibin extends a bit more towards the rump region , where it is turned off at some point , i.e.   the domain shows a sharp boundary .",
    "the relative position of the boundary is almost independent of the animal s size , i.e.  the ratio @xmath0 ( as denoted in fig .",
    "[ hydraped ] ) is almost invariant under changes of body size .",
    "as the pedibin / cn - nk2 system presumably plays an important role in determining the foot region , this invariance appears to be an essential prerequisite for maintaining the correct body proportions ( proportion regulation ) and to establish the head - foot polarity .",
    "such regulation of position information is a quite general problem in biological development @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem is how the specific properties of this regulation can be achieved by a small network of regulatory genes and if so , whether local communication between the cells ( networks ) is sufficient .",
    "this basic question is the central motivation for the present study .",
    "in particular , we consider the simplified problem of regulating one domain as , for example , the foot region versus the rest of the body .",
    "we consider this as a one dimensional problem as first approximation to the well - defined head - foot - axis in _",
    "hydra_.    = n y    = n y    developmental processes exhibit an astonishing robustness .",
    "this often includes the ability of de novo pattern formation , e.g. , to regenerate a _",
    "hydra _ even after complete dissociation of the cell ensemble in a centrifuge @xcite .",
    "further , they are robust in the face of a steady cell flux : _ hydra _ cells constantly move from the central body region along the body axis towards the top and bottom , where they differentiate into the respective cell types according to their position on the head - foot axis .",
    "the global pattern of gene activity is maintained in this dynamic environment .",
    "let us take these observations as a starting point for a detailed study how the interplay of noise - induced regulatory dynamics and cell flow may stabilize a developmental system .      to define a model system that performs the pattern formation task of domain self - organization @xcite ,",
    "consider a one - dimensional cellular automaton with parallel update @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 cells are arranged on a one - dimensional lattice , and each cell is labeled uniquely with an index @xmath2 .",
    "each cell can take @xmath3 possible states @xmath4 .",

    "neighborhood 3 _ ) . at the system boundaries , for simplicity we choose a discrete analogue of zero flux boundary conditions ,",
    "i.e.  we set @xmath13 .",
    "other choices , e.g.  asymmetric boundaries with cell update depending only on the inner neighbor cell , lead to similar results .",
    "the state evolution of course strongly depends on the choice of @xmath14 : for a three - state cellular automaton ( @xmath15 ) , there are @xmath16 possible update rules , each of which has a unique set of dynamical attractors .",
    "as we will show in the results section , @xmath17 is the minimal number of states necessary to solve the pattern formation problem formulated above .",
    "now we can formulate the problem we intend to solve as follows : find a set @xmath18 of functions ( update rules ) which , given a random initial vector @xmath19 , within @xmath20 update steps evolves the system s dynamics to a fixed point attractor with the property : @xmath21 \\\\",

    ". the scaling parameter @xmath23 may take any value @xmath24 . for simplicity ,",
    "it is fixed here to @xmath25 .",
    "notice that @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath1 , i.e.  we are looking for a set of solutions where the ratio of the domain sizes @xmath26 is _ invariant under changes of the system size_. this clearly is a non - trivial task when only local information transfer is allowed .",
    "the ratio @xmath27 is a _",
    "global property _ of the system , which has to emerge from purely local ( next neighbor ) interactions between the cell s states .",
    "one can now take a step further towards biological systems , by transferring the dynamics we found for a cellular automata chain onto cells in a line that communicate with each other , similar to biological cells .",
    "identifying states with cell types and assuming that the model cells have a network of regulators inside , each of them capable to reproduce the rules of a cellular automaton , we obtain a model mimicking basic properties of a biological genetic network in development .",
    "cellular automata rule tables can easily be translated into logical ( boolean ) networks , e.g. , for @xmath17 , two internal nodes can be used for binary coding of the cell states .",
    "one then has @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the so obtained rule tables are , by application of boolean logic , transformed into a minimized _ conjunctive normal form _ , which only makes use of the the three logical operators not , and and or with a minimal number of and operations .",
    "this is a rather realistic assumption for gene regulatory networks , as the and operation is more difficult to realize on the basis of interactions between transcription factors .",
    "other logical functions as , e.g. , xor , are even harder to realize biochemically @xcite .",
    "the structure of the constructed network and its biological interpretation is shown in fig .",
    "note that the up - down symmetry of the body axis is broken locally by a spatially asymmetric receptor distribution @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest model for transcriptional regulation networks are threshold networks , a subset of boolean networks , where logical functions are modeled by weighted sums of the nodes input states plus a threshold @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "they have proven to be valuable tools to address questions associated to the dynamics and evolution of gene regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "any boolean network which has been reduced to its minimized form ( here , the conjunctive normal form ) , can be coded as a dynamical threshold network , with minimally three hierachies of information processing ( `` input layer '' : signals from the neighbor cells at time @xmath10 , `` hidden layer '' : logical processing of the signals , `` output layer '' : states of the two `` pattern genes '' in cell @xmath6 at time @xmath31 ) .",
    "the genes states now may take values @xmath32 , and likewise for the interaction weights one has @xmath33 for activating and inhibiting regulation , respectively , and @xmath34 if gene i does not receive an input from gene @xmath35 in cell @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamics then is defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 for the `` hidden '' genes , where @xmath39 is the state of the @xmath40th _ output _ gene in cell @xmath36 ( there are no couplings between the genes in the `` hidden '' layer ) . the threshold @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 which implements a logical or operation .",
    "for the `` output '' ( pattern forming ) genes , one simply has @xmath43",
    "i.e.  the weights are all set to one , and the ( negative ) threshold equals the number of inputs @xmath44 that gene @xmath40 receives from the `` hidden '' genes ( logical and ) .",
    "the first major outcome of the cellular automata model is that a number of @xmath15 different states is necessary and sufficient for this class of systems to solve the given pattern formation task .",
    "the update table of the fittest solution found during optimization runs , which solves the problem independent of system size for about 98 percent of ( randomly chosen ) initial conditions ( i.e. has fitness @xmath45 ) , is shown in table i. fig .",

    "hence , the pattern self - organization in this system exhibits considerable robustness against fluctuations in the initial conditions .",
    "the main mechanism leading to stabilization at @xmath47 is a modulation of the traveling velocity of the right phase boundary in fig .  2 such that the boundary on average moves slightly more than one cell to the left per update step , whereas the left boundary moves one cell to the right exactly every third update step .",
    "the modulation of the right boundary can be seen as the result of interacting phase boundaries reminiscent of particle interactions .",

    "in the following we will study dynamics and robustness of the model with respect to noise .",
    "two kinds of perturbations frequently occur : stochastic update errors and external forces cased by a directed _ cell flow _",
    "due to cell proliferations .",
    "both types of perturbations are very common during animal development , e.g. , in _ hydra _ cells continuously move from the central body region along the body axis towards the top and bottom , and differentiate into the respective cell types along the way according to their position on the head - foot axis .",
    "let us define stochastic update errors with probability @xmath49 per cell , leading to an average error rate @xmath50 .",
    "interestingly , this stochastic noise starts moving `` particle '' excitations in the cellular automaton which , as a result indeed stabilize the developmental structure of the system . to prepare for the details of these effects ,",
    "define first how we measure the boundary position properly in the presence of noise .",
    "let us use a statistical method to measure the boundary position in order to get conclusive results also for high @xmath49 : starting at @xmath51 , we put a `` measuring frame '' of size @xmath52 over cell @xmath6 and the next @xmath53 cells , move this frame to the right and , for each @xmath6 , measure the fraction @xmath54 of cells with state @xmath55 within the frame .",
    "the algorithm stops when @xmath54 drops below @xmath56 and the boundary position is defined to be @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that , for not too high @xmath49 , there are only two different quasi - particles ( i.e. state perturbations moving through the homogeneous phases ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ particles ] . in the following ,",
    "these particles are called @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "interaction with the domain boundary readjusts it one cell to the right .",
    "thus we find that the average position @xmath66 of the boundary is given by the rate equation @xmath67 i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "interestingly , for not too high error rates @xmath69 , @xmath66 is independent from @xmath69 and thus from @xmath49 .",

    "the shift of @xmath72 is most easily measured by defining a lower and a upper boundary @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ( fig .",

    "[ particles ] , the interaction of a @xmath58 particle with the boundary needs only one update time step , whereas the boundary readjustment following a @xmath59 particle interaction takes three update time steps .",
    "hence , we conclude that the term on the right hand side of eqn .  ( 10 ) , which gives the flow rate of @xmath59 particles at the boundary , for large @xmath69 will saturate at @xmath89 , leading to @xmath90 with the solution @xmath91 for @xmath92 . hence , there is a crossover from the solution @xmath68 to another solution vanishing with @xmath93 around @xmath94 .",
    "the finite size scaling term @xmath95 can be estimated from the following consideration : for @xmath96 , the average domain size created by `` pure chance '' is given by @xmath97 .",
    "if the measuring window has size @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath98 .",
    "to summarize , we find that the self - organized boundary position is given by @xmath99 with a first - order phase transition at @xmath71 and a crossover around @xmath94 .",

    "it is easy to see that the error rate @xmath69 just provides a time scale for relaxation towards the stationary distribution and has no effect on the stationary distribution itself .",

    "the outcome of this search algorithm is a set of rule tables , which then can be `` translated '' into ( spatially coupled ) boolean networks or threshold networks with suitable thresholds .",
    "this yields a set of ( minimal ) dynamical networks which solve the pattern formation task by means of internal information processing .",
    "= n y    = n y    = n y      the genetic algorithm sketched above is run with the following parameter choices : @xmath150 , i.e.  during ga runs the system size is varied randomly between @xmath151 and @xmath152 cells , and the population size is set to @xmath153 .",
    "[ evo ] shows the fitness of the highest fitness mutant and the average fitness of the population as a function of the number of successive mutation steps during optimization .",
    "a useful solution is found rather quickly ( after about 200 updates ) , with further optimization observed during futher 10000 generations . at time",
    "step 10000 mutations are turned off , thus now the average fitness of the established population under random initial conditions and random fluctuations of the system size @xmath1 is tested .",
    "the average fitness @xmath154 indicates a surprisingly high robustness against fluctuations in the initial start pattern , indicating that the system is capable of _ de novo pattern formation_. in the `` fitness picture '' , fig .",
    "[ fitofn ] confirms that the dynamically regulated domain size ratio @xmath0 indeed is independent of system size ( proportion regulation ) , there is only a weak decay of the fitness at small values of @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , one also observes that for regeneration of hydra polyps from random cell aggregates a minimum number of cells is required @xcite .",
    "the model suggests that this observation might be explained by the dynamics of an underlying pattern generating mechanism , i.e.  that there has to be a minimum diversity in the initial condition for successful de novo pattern formation .",
    "an interesting question is how `` difficult '' it would be for an evolutionary process driven by random mutations and selection to find solutions for the pattern formation problem based on neighbor interactions between cells .",
    "as we showed above , the genetic algorithm finds the correct solution fast , however , this does not necessarily mean that biological evolution could access the same solution as fast .",
    "if there is only one , singular solution , evolution may never succeed finding it , as the genotype which already exists can not be modified in an arbitrary way without possibly destroying function of the organism ( _ developmental constrains _ ) . to illustrate this point",
    ", we generated an ensemble of @xmath155 different solutions with @xmath156 and performed a statistical analysis of the rule table structure .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ rulstat ] , some positions in the rule table are quite fixed , i.e. , there is not much variety in the outputs , whereas other positions are more variable .",
    "however , the output frequency distribution alone does not allow to really judge the `` evolvability '' of the solutions : if there are strong correlations between most of the rule table entries , evolutionary transitions from one solution to another would be almost impossible . to check this point , we studied statistical two point correlations between the rule table entries .",
    "the probability for finding state @xmath157 at position @xmath158 and state @xmath159 at rule table position @xmath160 is given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath3 runs over the statistical ensemble of size @xmath163 .",
    "the two point correlation between @xmath158 and @xmath160 then is defined as @xmath164 with @xmath165 and @xmath166 to obtain a proper normalization with respect to the two limiting cases of equal probabilities ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath168 for @xmath169 and @xmath170 for all other @xmath171 ) .",
    "[ rulcorr ] shows the frequency distribution of @xmath172 , averaged over all possible pairs @xmath173 .",
    "about 65% of rule table positions are strongly correlated ( @xmath174 ) , the rest shows correlation values between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "hence , we find that the space of solutions is restricted , nevertheless there is variability in several rule table positions . to summarize this aspect ,",
    "the pattern formation mechanism studied in this paper shows considerable robustness against rule mutations , however , a `` core module '' of rules is always fixed .",
    "interestingly , a similar phenomenon is observed in developmental biology : regulatory `` modules '' involved in developmental processes often are evolutionaryly very conservative , i.e. , they are shared by almost all animal phyla @xcite , while morphological variety is created by ( few ) taxon specific genes @xcite and `` rewiring '' of existing developmental modules .",
