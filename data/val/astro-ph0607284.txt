    "recent observations of cosmological fluctuations from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) strongly support basic predictions of inflationary scenarios : primordial fluctuations are nearly scale - invariant @xcite , adiabatic @xcite , and gaussian ( * ? ? ?",

    "in order to discriminate between more - than-100 candidate inflationary models , however , one needs to look for _ deviations _ from the scale - invariance , adiabaticity as well as gaussianity , for which different inflationary models make specific predictions .",
    "inflationary models based upon a slowly rolling single - field scalar field generally predict very small deviations from gaussianity ; however , the post - inflationary evolution of non - linear metric perturbations inevitably generates ubiquitous non - gaussian fluctuations . on the other hand , a broad class of inflationary models based upon different assumptions about the nature of scalar field(s ) can generate significant primordial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "therefore , gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations offers a direct test of inflationary models .",

    "the actual predictions usually include momentum dependence in @xmath13 .",

    "nevertheless , a constant @xmath0 is still a useful parameterization of non - gaussianity which enables us to obtain simple analytical formulae for the statistical quantities to compare with observations .",
    "the use of a constant @xmath0 is also justified by the fact that the current observations are not sensitive enough to detect momentum - dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we adopt the constant @xmath0 for our analysis throughout this paper .",
    "note that it is actually straightforward to extend our formalism to a momentum - dependent @xmath0 .",

    "the analytical formulae are extremely valuable especially when one tries to measure non - gaussian signals from the data .",
    "fast , nearly optimal estimators for @xmath0 have been derived on the basis of these analytical formulae @xcite , and have been successfully applied to the cmb data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) : the current constraint on @xmath13 from the angular bispectrum is @xmath14 to @xmath15 at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",
