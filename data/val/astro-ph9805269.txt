    "advances in satellite instrumentation , e.g. , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , and the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) , are greatly stimulating and guiding theoretical research on accretion physics .",
    "the recent discovery of khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , extends the frequency range over which these oscillations occur into timescales associated with the innermost regions of the accretion process ( for a review see van der klis 1996 ) .",
    "stella and vietri ( 1997 ) have proposed that observed low frequency qpos in neutron star x - ray binaries correspond to the precession of the accretion disk , i.e. , the lense - thirring effect .",
    "this could be the first evidence for a genuinely general relativistic effect , i.e. , the dragging of inertial frames , in such systems .",
    "morgan , remillard and greiner ( 1997 ) identified a 67 hz qpo in the black hole candidate grs 1915 + 105 which may be associated with relativistic trapped inner disk oscillations ( nowak et al .",
    "recently , cui , zhang and chen ( 1998 ) have extended the interpretation of stella and vietri to black hole binaries . within this model , gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105",
    "are found to spin at a rate close to the maximum theoretical limit .",
    "moreover , in extragalactic sources , spectroscopic evidence ( broad iron emission lines ) increasingly points to ( rotating ) black holes being the accreting central objects ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; kormendy and richstone 1995 ) .",
    "recently , bromley , miller and pariev ( 1998 ) placed a limit on the inner edge of the accretor giving rise to the iron k@xmath0 emission in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 at about 2.6 schwarzschild radii .",
    "their estimate is that the black hole is rotating at a rate which is about @xmath1 % of the allowed maximum .",
    "early theoretical studies indicated that a rotating black hole in the presence of an accretion disk must be spinning at nearly the maximal rate ( thorne 1974 ) .",
    "rotation increases the available energy in the near - horizon region : the binding energy per unit mass of a test particle can reach up to @xmath2 and the innermost stable circular orbit approaches the horizon ( bardeen , press and teukolsky 1972 ) and coincides with it ( at least in areal coordinates ) in the extreme case @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the mass of the hole and @xmath5 its specific angular momentum ) . in the rotating case ,",
    "motions away from the equatorial plane are affected by the dragging of inertial frames , while motions in the ergo - region may ( more speculatively ) extract rotational energy from the hole .",
    "accretion theory is primarily based on the study of stationary flows and linearized perturbations thereof . establishing the nature of flow instabilities ,",
    "though , will almost certainly require highly resolved and accurate , time - dependent , non - linear numerical investigations .",
    "especially intriguing is the possibility of establishing features of the accretion process that are reflecting the nature of the spacetime .",
    "such numerical probes rely crucially on adequate and consistent approximations of the geometry . for a wide range of accretion problems , a newtonian theory of gravity _",
    "is _ adequate for the description of the background gravitational forces .",
    "the extensive experience with newtonian astrophysics suggests that the first explorations of the relativistic regime could benefit from the use of _ model potentials _ ( paczyski and wiita 1980 ) .",
    "this constitutes the _ newtonian paradigm _ , which is still being developed ( e.g. , nowak and wagoner 1991 ; artemova , bjrnsson and novikov 1996 ) .",
    "for comprehensive numerical work , a full ( i.e. , three - dimensional ) formalism is required , able to cover also the maximally rotating hole . in rotating spacetimes",
    "the gravitational forces can not be captured fully with scalar potential formalisms .",
    "a vivid example is provided by the wave systems examined in chandrashekhar ( 1983 ) , in which rotation introduces _ frequency _ dependent potentials .",
    "additionally , geometric regions such as the ergo - sphere would be very hard to model without a metric description .",
    "whereas the bulk of emission occurs in regions with almost newtonian fields , only the observable features attributed to the inner region may crucially depend on the nature of the spacetime .",
    "pioneering numerical efforts in the study of accretion onto black holes ( wilson 1972 ; hawley , smarr and wilson 1984 ; hawley 1991 ) , established the relativistic framework , the so - called _ frozen star paradigm _ of a black hole . in this , the time  slicing \" of the spacetime is synchronized with that of asymptotic observers far from the hole .",
    "this is a powerful approach , leading to a very economical description of the geometry and can , _ in principle _ , be used to capture all the interesting effects of the spacetime curvature .",
    "we focus here on the limitations of this approach which further motivate this _ letter_. the shortcomings are due to the poor choice of coordinates near the black hole horizon and , hence , manifest themselves only in its neighborhood .",
    "we have argued , though , that this is precisely the region of most interest .",
    "a set of consistency problems arises from the need for correct boundary conditions at the horizon .",
    "such conditions are easily imposed on simple supersonic inflows , but become murkier for co - rotating accretion disks on rapidly - rotating kerr black holes .",
    "in addition , imposing boundary conditions on magnetic fields is problematic . addressing this issue",
    "has led to the development of the so - called _",
    "membrane paradigm_. starting with the description of the black hole processes in a non - singular coordinate system ( damour 1978 ) , this approach endows an _ approximate _ horizon ( a timelike worldtube ) with special electric and magnetic properties and then reverts back to the frozen star picture for the description of the rest of the spacetime ( thorne and macdonald 1986 ) .",
    "however , the computation is still performed in the original singular system . imposing boundary conditions near the horizon",
    "becomes a demanding practical task , as the singular coordinate coverage of the horizon leads to an unphysical blowup of coordinate dependent quantities .",
    "in papadopoulos and font ( 1998 ) ( pf hereafter ) we put forward the idea of numerically computing accretion flows onto a black hole in a coordinate system adapted to the horizon .",
    "there , we used simple spherically symmetric flows to establish its basic feasibility .",
    "in addition , we computed axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic accretion onto _ schwarzschild _ black holes .",
    "we noticed that even the stiff adiabatic index case @xmath6 was computable , illustrating one of the advantages of a regular coordinate system . in the remainder of this _",
    "letter _ we demonstrate , using a model calculation , the functionality of our framework to study accretion flows onto rapidly - rotating black holes .",
    "coordinate systems attached to physical observers are generically regular at the horizon , but lack the important practical property of stationarity .",
    "if , besides regularity , we impose the additional requirements of a stationary metric and spacelike foliation we obtain what we call _ horizon adapted coordinates_. a comprehensive family of those systems for the kerr spacetime can be obtained with the following transformation from the standard boyer - lindquist ( bl ) @xmath7 to the new coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 dr$ ] , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a non - negative integer which parametrizes the family ( natural units are used throughout , @xmath15 ) .",
    "all members of the family are regular at the horizon , hence the algebraically simplest choice ( @xmath16 ) is preferred .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called kerr - schild ( ks ) form of the kerr metric . with this choice",
    "the line element becomes @xmath17 d\\tilde{\\phi}^2 .",
    "\\label{ksform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the regularity at the horizon , which is located at the largest root of the equation @xmath18 , is manifest . a more extensive discussion , in particular of the wider range of choices available in the non - rotating case , is given in pf .",
    "the central aspect of our computational paradigm is that the integration domain includes , in a natural way , the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "in fact , it extends _ inside _ the horizon and can be truncated at an arbitrary inner radius . this prescription solves , at once , both conceptual and practical problems in the near horizon region .",
    "boundary conditions for fields can be imposed in an unambiguous manner , whereas there is a sharp reduction in the spatial gradients of the solution .",
    "the first benefit arises from the nature of the horizon as a one way ( ingoing ) membrane . in the absence of good boundary conditions even ",
    "poor \" conditions would be acceptable , provided they allow a stable and converging computation . for example , unphysical reflections or numerical heating will never re - emerge from the horizon , since the characteristic speeds for such processes are necessarily slower than @xmath19 .",
    "the reduced resolution requirements arise from the fact that the projections of four - vectors onto the three - dimensional integration space is everywhere regular , given the regular coordinate system .",
    "the regularization of the horizon introduces two new non - zero metric elements .",
    "however , this additional algebraic complexity should not be much of a concern for relativistic integration algorithms which must be designed to handle a general metric .",
    "on the other hand , it is a fact that considerable intuition and mathematical tools have been obtained in the simpler frozen star form of the kerr metric .",
    "this background work can still be used by transforming geometric quantities back and forth . for stationary accretion patterns",
    "this process is entirely straightforward and we include a demonstration of such transformations below .",
    "the generic astrophysical scenario in which matter is accreted in a non - spherical way by a compact object is the one suggested originally by bondi and hoyle ( 1944 ) .",
    "the astrophysical importance of this process has led to its detailed numerical investigation ( see e.g. , benensohn , lamb and taam 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the relativistic version of the bondi - hoyle accretion has been extended to the non - axisymmetric , non - rotating black hole case ( font and ibez 1998b ) .",
    "its generalization to account for rotating black holes remains still unexplored .",
    "we take here the first step in that direction , investigating the problem adopting a simple geometrical scenario . at the same time",
    ", this scenario offers an adequate test - bed calculation to demonstrate the proposal of horizon adapted coordinates for accretion onto _ rotating black holes_.    in performing the computation , we adopt the  infinitesimally thin \" accretion disk setup .",
    "this is motivated by simplicity considerations , before attempting three - dimensional studies .",
    "this initial setup has been used to some extent in newtonian simulations of wind accretion in cylindrical and cartesian coordinates ( see , e.g. , matsuda et al 1991 , benensohn , lamb and taam 1997 and references therein ) . in our setup",
    "we use a restricted set of equations , where the vertical structure of the flow is assumed not to depend on the polar coordinate .",
    "this assumption requires that in the _ immediate neighborhood _ of the equator , vertical ( polar ) pressure gradients , velocities and gravity ( tidal ) terms vanish .",
    "those conditions are strictly correct at the equator for flows that are reflection symmetric there . hence , despite the obvious reduction of generality , important insights into the accretion process can be obtained in a simplified framework . in particular , as will be apparent from the discussion of the flow morphology below , our dimensional simplification still captures the most demanding aspect of the kerr background , which is encoded in the large azimuthal shift vector near the horizon .",
    "this is most relevant for the issues discussed in this work .    for the computation we use the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations",
    "as presented in banyuls et al .",
    "hence we take advantage of the explicit knowledge of the characteristic fields in order to build up a linearized riemann solver to handle discontinuous solutions .",
    "the formulation of the equations in schwarzschild coordinates and the numerical algorithm can be found in font and ibez ( 1998a ) .",
    "tests of the code can be found in font et al ( 1994 ) ( for the subclass of special relativistic flows ) and banyuls et al ( 1997 ) ( for general relativistic flows in schwarzschild backgrounds ) . to perform the simulation we present below",
    ", we specialize the equations to the ks form of the metric , eq .",
    "( [ ksform ] ) .",
    "specific details , including the description of the time - dependent variables , fluxes and source terms of the equations in bl and ks coordinates , as well as a comparative study of the accretion flows in those systems will be reported in a forthcoming paper ( font , ibez and papadopoulos 1998b ; fip hereafter ) .",
    "the initial state of the fluid is completely characterized by the asymptotic conditions upstream the accretor .",
    "we choose as free parameters the asymptotic velocity @xmath20 , the sound speed @xmath21 and the adiabatic index @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , as the accretor is a rotating black hole , we have an extra parameter , @xmath5 , its angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "we choose a rapidly - rotating hole with @xmath23 .",
    "the simulation is performed in the equatorial plane ( @xmath24 ) using an ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) grid of @xmath27 zones .",
    "representative results of our simulations are plotted in fig .  1 , where we show isocontours of the logarithm of the density at the final time @xmath28",
    ". the hole is rotating counter - clockwise .",
    "this simulation employs ks coordinates , with the innermost grid radius placed at @xmath29 , i.e. , _ inside _ the horizon , @xmath30 , which for our model is @xmath31 .",
    "the outermost radius corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the position of the horizon .",
    "the simulation is characterized by the presence of a well - defined tail shock .",
    "the flow pattern reaches a steady - state around @xmath33 , which was confirmed computing the time evolution of the mass accretion rate as described in fip .",
    "the transformations to horizon adapted coordinates are non - trivial , from a geometric point of view , in the sense that a new _ time _",
    "coordinate is involved .",
    "there is no one - to - one correspondence between snapshots of evolutions in the two different systems .",
    "still , for accretion flows that relax to a stationary state , the time dependence is , by definition , factored out and a direct comparison is possible by transforming four dimensional tensor quantities appropriately ( details are given in fip ) . making use of the final stationarity of the flow , we plot in fig .  2 how the accretion pattern would look like were the computation performed in bl coordinates .",
    "the transformation induces a noticeable wrapping of the shock around the central hole .",
    "the shock would wrap infinitely many times before reaching the horizon , due to an additional coordinate pathology of the bl system . as a result ,",
    "the computation in bl coordinates , although in principle possible , would be much more challenging than in ks coordinates , particularly near to the horizon .",
    "genuine effects , such as frame dragging are expected in the case of accretion not on the equatorial plane .",
    "since the last stable orbit approaches closely the horizon in the case of maximal rotation , the interesting scenario of co - rotating extreme kerr accretion would be severely affected by the strong gradients which develop in the strong - field region .",
    "this will most certainly affect the accuracy and , potentially , also the stability of numerical codes .",
    "an example of instabilities possibly related to coordinate issues has been reported recently ( igumenshchev and beloborodov 1997 ) .",
    "we have shown the feasibility of a new geometrical approach to the numerical study of accretion flows onto rotating black holes .",
    "our procedure relies on the use of _ horizon adapted coordinate systems _ in which all fields , i.e. , metric , fluid and electromagnetic fields , are free of coordinate singularities at the event horizon . among the large family of those systems we propose the use of the kerr - schild coordinate system",
    " the simplest example of the class  as the natural framework to perform accurate numerical studies of relativistic accretion flows . we have discussed our approach in the context of the various paradigms in black hole astrophysics .",
    "our proposal shares with the frozen star picture the exact representation of the relativistic geometry .",
    "it departs from it in significant ways in the crucial horizon region , in which a choice of different time coordinate allows the explicit use of the `` one way membrane '' picture in the computations .",
    "we conclude that smooth coordinate systems at the horizon become an invaluable tool for the numerical study of accretion phenomena around extreme kerr black holes . coupled with high resolution numerical methods",
    "these systems may help clarify the basic dynamical processes around accreting black holes .",
