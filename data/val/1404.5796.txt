    "the new particle discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite has been confirmed to be consistent with the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , and this fact strengthens the validity of the sm as a fundamental theory of elementary particles . on the other hand , it is presumed that there are various phenomena in the early universe which can not be addressed in the framework of the sm .",
    "in particular , it is widely believed that at the beginning of the universe there must be the stage of the accelerated expansion of the universe called inflation  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of inflation solves several puzzles such as the flatness and horizon problems  @xcite , but it dilutes away the primordial baryon ( b ) number , implying that the creation of the b number ( baryogenesis ) should occur after inflation in order to explain tiny but non - vanishing ratio of baryons to photons @xmath9 required by the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "this mystery motivates us to extend the sm to a more fundamental theory . in this paper , we focus on supersymmetry as a possible extension of the sm",
    ".    in supersymmetric field theories , generically there exist so - called the flat directions , in which the potential for scalar fields vanishes in the absence of the soft supersymmetry breaking effects and nonrenormalizable operators . in the context of cosmology , it is expected that some scalar fields corresponding to such flat directions get large expectation values during / after inflation .",
    "if such scalar fields have nonvanishing b and lepton ( l ) numbers with some b and/or l violating interactions , which is true for the supersymmetric extension of the sm , the primordial b asymmetry can be generated via the dynamics of these scalar fields after inflation .",
    "this kind of scenario for the generation of the b asymmetry of the universe is called the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism  @xcite [ for reviews , see ref .",
    "@xcite ] .",
    "in addition to this mechanism for baryogenesis , supersymmetry is attractive for various reasons , such as the grand unification of the fundamental forces and the solution for the hierarchy problem [ see e.g. ref .",
    "however , the low scale supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem suffers from the tension with the recent results at the lhc which indicates that no evidence for the new physics is observed at the weak scale .",
    "this fact suggests that the minimal supersymmetric version of the sm ( mssm ) becomes unnatural , and the supersymmetric model of the sm should be extended beyond the minimal one .",
    "one of the possible extensions is to introduce the violation of r - parity .",
    "r - parity  @xcite is to impose the parity symmetry @xmath10 for the field content of the mssm , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the spin , b number , and l number of the particle , respectively .",
    "this parity is well motivated from the phenomenological point of view , since it suppresses the unwanted proton decay ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2 - 1 ] ) , and ensures the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which becomes a good candidate of dark matter .",
    "however , there might be no fundamental reason to introduce the r - parity as a global symmetry , and in general it can be largely violated .",
    "indeed , sizable r - parity violating interactions can be obtained in the framework of grand unified theories  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the r - parity violation is getting more attention these days , since it modifies the signatures observed at the lhc , which relaxes the stringent limits on the masses of supersymmetric particles  @xcite .    the introduction of the r - parity violation has a lot of relevance to the scenario of baryogenesis , since it gives b / l number violating operators in the renormalizable superpotential [ see eq .  ] . in this paper",
    ", we argue that the ad mechanism for baryogenesis naturally works via these b / l violating interactions .",
    "it is also known that the r - parity violating interactions , together with the sphaleron process  @xcite which remains in the thermal equilibrium until the epoch of the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , erase the primordial b number  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the estimation of the final b asymmetry becomes nontrivial because of these two competing factors .",
    "regarding this fact , we can consider the following two possibilities : one is the scenario where the baryogenesis occurs with a sufficiently small r - parity violating coupling such that the erasure effect becomes ineffective .",
    "another scenario is that the primordial b number is preserved in the form of the nontopological soliton called q - balls  @xcite , which protect the b asymmetry of the universe from the erasure effect until the epoch of the ewpt .",
    "we will show that the later scenario suffers from the difficulty to explain the present b asymmetry because the destruction effects of q - balls become significant in the thermal environment .",
    "it should be noted that lsp is not stable in the scenario considered in this paper .",
    "therefore , lsps do not play a role of dark matter of the universe , which should be explained by other candidates such as axions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to resolve the coincidence between abundances of baryon and dark matter  @xcite in the framework of the model presented in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we summarize the current constraints on the r - parity violating couplings .",
    "these include indirect bounds based on the results of experimental studies and cosmological bounds such as the dissociation of light elements and the erasure of the primordial b number . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the ad mechanism by the use of the r - parity violating operators is discussed .",
    "we solve the evolution of the scalar field condensate after inflation , and estimate the b number generated from this mechanism .",
    "then , we introduce the finite temperature effects and derive some conditions for q - balls to survive against the destruction effects such as the evaporation into the surrounding plasma and the instability caused by the @xmath14 violating operator in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . combining these results",
    ", we investigate the parameter region where the baryogenesis occurs successfully in sec .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "the general renormalizable r - parity violating superpotential allowed by the gauge invariance and the field content of the mssm can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 are family indices , and contraction over gauge indices is understood . because of the gauge invariant contractions of @xmath17 fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 fields @xmath20 , the coupling @xmath21 is antisymmetric in its first two indices , and @xmath22 is antisymmetric in its last two indices .",

    "it should be emphasized that there are in general 96 ( complex ) independent r - parity violating parameters , and we will not quote every bound on these parameters .",
    "instead , we just enumerate several constraints which are relevant to our discussions on cosmology .",

    "the most severe constraints on the trilinear r - parity violating couplings @xmath21 , @xmath34 , and @xmath22 are obtained from observations of single nucleon decay  @xcite .",

    "is obtained for the products @xmath46 ( @xmath47 @xmath48 ) from @xmath40 squark t - channel exchange diagrams .",
    "furthermore , decay processes such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 can occur due to diagrams mediated by virtual neutralinos , which lead to bounds on the products @xmath52  @xcite . numerical values of these bounds depend on the family indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "note that the stringent bound [ eq .  ] is applied on the product of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "their lifetime is given by  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the masses of the lsp and sfermions , respectively .",
    "since the decay process via r - parity violating interactions involves hadronic energy injection , the late decay of lsps is tightly constrained from the requirement that it must not lead to the dissociation of light elements created during the epoch of bbn  @xcite . according to the constraint on late - decaying particles obtained in refs .",

    "@xcite indicates that the lifetime must be shorter than @xmath67 .",

    "this condition leads to the _ lower _ bound on the trilinear r - parity violating couplings : @xmath68 for a fixed value of @xmath3 , this condition becomes @xmath69    when we combine two constraints given by eqs .   and",

    "as we mentioned in the introduction , another stringent upper bound on the trilinear r - parity violating couplings is obtained from the requirement of baryogenesis .",
    "the effect of the nonperturbative process mediated by field configurations known as sphalerons  @xcite becomes significant at temperatures higher than @xmath71 , which washes out the primordial ( b@xmath72l ) number but conserves the ( b@xmath73l ) number  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this sphaleron process , if b and/or l violating interactions due to the r - parity violating operators are in the thermal equilibrium at the temperature above the weak scale , they completely erase the primordial b / l asymmetry  @xcite . here , we quote the bound obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the calculation of @xmath74 processes between fermion pairs and sfermions .",

    "in addition to the bounds described in the previous subsections , the magnitude of r - parity violating couplings can be constrained from various experimental results , such as charged and neutral current interactions , cp violations , electroweak precision measurements , hadron or lepton flavor violating processes , and b or l violating processes .",

    "in this section , we turn our attention to the mechanism for baryogenesis . in the ad mechanism , a - terms associated with b or l number violating operators in the superpotential",

    "in such a case we expect that the abundance of lsps produced from the thermal bath becomes larger than the usual case , since their cross section is not fixed by the weak scale , but its mass scale [ i.e. @xmath405 . therefore , we must take account of the entropy production due to the decay of these lsps , which is likely to reduce the efficiency of this baryogenesis scenario . from this reason ,",
    "we conclude that the present b asymmetry can hardly be explained for the case where the magnitude of the r - parity violation is as large as @xmath406 .     but @xmath407 is plotted as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath163 for @xmath408 . the line of  q - ball survival \" [ eq .  ]",

    "in this paper , we consider a scenario where the b number of the universe is created via the ad mechanism with the r - parity violating operators in the supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "the ad mechanism works due to the presence of the trilinear r - parity violating interaction of the form given by eq .  , which lifts the flat directions of the mssm .",
    "the dynamics of the ad field after inflation is calculated , and the net baryon to entropy ratio is estimated as eq .  .",
    "the subsequent dynamics of q - balls is also discussed , and it is found that q - balls are likely to be destructed in the thermal environment .",
    "this result leads to the difficulty in explaining the present b asymmetry with the low temperature baryogenesis due to the decay of long - lived q - balls .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to generate an adequate amount of the b number for the r - parity violating couplings as large as @xmath406 .",
    "we also find that the present b asymmetry can be explained in the broad parameter region below the bound given by eq .  , where the wash out effect of the primordial b number due to the sphaleron transition and r - parity violating interactions become negligible .",
    "however , there is a lower bound on the r - parity violating couplings [ eq .  ] from the requirement that unstable lsps must decay before the epoch of bbn . to avoid these constraints",
    ", we must require the value of the r - parity violating coupling @xmath412 and the gravitino mass @xmath7 .",
    "these results imply that , for the scenario to work , the r - parity should be mildly violated and the mass scale of supersymmetry should be relatively heavy .",
