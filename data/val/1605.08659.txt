    "it has been realized for years that the scale - invariant power - law behaviors are frequently observed in statistical properties of earthquakes , _",
    "i.e. _ , the properties for an ensemble of earthquakes which are obtained after averaging over sufficiently many events .",
    "these include the well - known gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law for the magnitude distribution of earthquakes and the omori law for the time evolution of the frequency of aftershocks .",
    "such an observation motivates the `` self - organized criticality ( soc ) '' view of earthquakes @xcite , which regards the earth s crust as being in the critical state which is self - generated dynamically @xcite .",
    "in contrast , one should also bear in mind that real earthquakes often exhibit apparently opposite features , _",
    "i.e. _ , the features represented by `` characteristic earthquakes '' where an earthquake is regarded to possess its characteristic energy or time scale @xcite .    statistical physical study of earthquakes is often based on simplified models of various levels of simplification @xcite .",
    "there are several advantages in employing simplified models in the study of earthquakes . in the model study , it is straightforward to control various material parameters as input parameters , whereas a systematic field study of the material - parameter dependence of real earthquakes meets serious difficulties .",
    "furthermore , large earthquakes are rare , occurring , say , once hundreds of years for a given fault , and it is extremely difficult to examine the reproducibility of the observed phenomena and to take data with reliable error bars attached . in the model studies , on the other hand , it is often not difficult to put reliable error bars to the data under well controled conditions , say , by performing extensive computer simulations .",
    "one of the standard models widely employed in statistical physical study of earthquakes might be the burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model @xcite .",
    "the model was first introduced in ref.@xcite . in the bk model ,",
    "an earthquake fault is simulated by an assembly of blocks , each of which is connected via the elastic springs to to the neighboring blocks and to the moving rigid plate , and are slowly driven by an external force mimicking the plate drive . as discussed in ref.@xcite , the many - block bk model may well represent the motion of a deformable fault layer , possibly corresponding to the low - velocity fault zone ( lvfz ) observed in many long mature faults @xcite , pulled uniformly by the more or less rigid crust contingent to it .",
    "the model might also be useful in describing other stick - slip - type phenomena such as landslides @xcite .    in earthquakes studies ,",
    "the simplicity of the bk model might provide us some benefitial points as compared with , _",
    "e.g. _ , the standard elastodynamical continuum model .",
    "for one , the simplicity of the model often enables one to generate sufficiently many events , say , hundres of thousands of events , to reliably evaluate the statistical properties with reliable statistical precision , while , in the continuum model , only small number of events are usually generated . for the other",
    ", the bk model contains only small number of fundamental parameters , which makes it possible via the systematic survey of these parameter dependence to concentrate on the role and the inter - relation of these small number of fundamental parameters in earthquake occurrence , to extract and clarify the physical mechanism underlying apparently complex earthquake phenomena . finally ,",
    "the bk model , even in its continuum limit , describes a setting a bit different from that of the standard elastodynamical continuum model .",
    "a crucially important part of the model might be the type of friction force assumed @xcite . in the pioneering study of the statistical properties of the bk model , carlson , langer and collaborators employed the simple velocity - weakening friction force .",
    "the friction force is assumed to be a single - valued decreasing function of the velocity @xcite .",
    "more realistic constitutive relation now standard in seismology might be the rate - and - state dependent friction ( rsf ) law @xcite .",
    "the rsf law assumes that the friction depends not only on the slip velocity @xmath5 but also on the `` state '' of the slip interface , which is phenomenologically described via the `` state variable '' @xmath6 obeying its own evolution law .",
    "the time - evolution law of the state variable generally includes a characteristic slip distance @xmath7 , which gives a measure of the length scale at which a slip interface loses its initial memory of the state .",
    "this rsf law has widely been used in numerical simulations mostly on the continuum model @xcite , but also on the bk model .",
    "for example , cao and aki performed a numerical simulation of earthquakes by combining the 1d bk model with the rsf law in which various constitutive parameters were set nonuniform over blocks @xcite .",
    "ohmura and kawamura extended an earlier calculation by cao and aki to study the statistical properties of the 1d bk model combined with the rsf law with uniform constitutive parameters @xcite .",
    "clancy and corcoran also performed a numerical simulation of the 1d bk model based on a modified version of the rsf law @xcite .",
    "of course , the space discretization in the form of blocks inherent to the bk model is an approximation to the original continuum crust .",
    "( note , however , that the discreteness may also be regarded as a measure of the underlying spatial inhomogeneity @xcite . )",
    "it introduces the short - length cut - off scale into the problem in the form of the block size , which could in principle give rise to an artificial effect not realized in the continuum .",
    "rice criticized that the discrete bk model with a simple velocity - weakening law was `` intrinsically discrete '' , lacking in a well - defined continuum limit , arguing that the spatiotemporal complexity observed in the discrete bk model was due to an inherent discreteness of the model , which should disappear in continuum @xcite .",
    "if the grid spacing @xmath8 is taken larger than the `` nucleation length '' which was proportional to the slip distance @xmath7 , the system exhibits an apparently complex or critical behavior , whereas , if the grid spacing @xmath8 is taken smaller than it , the system tends to exhibit a quasi - periodic recurrence of large events . in this picture , the block - discretization effect of the bk model should closely be related to its nucleation phenomena via the nucleation length . in the continuum limit where the grid spacing tends to zero",
    ", the system is expected to always exhibit a quasi - periodic or a `` characteristic '' behavior where large earthquakes repeat near - periodically without critical features @xcite .",
    "indeed , we recently examined the nature of the nucleation process of the discrete bk model under the rsf law by systematically varying the extent of the discreteness of the model toward the continuum limit , and also by systematically varying various model parameters including the frictional and the elastic parameters @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the model exhibited a quasi - static initial phase in its nucleation process when the frictional instability was weak , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the normalized frictional - weakening parameter @xmath9 was less than a critical value @xmath10 determined by the elastic - stiffness parameter @xmath11 as @xmath12 , while the quasi - static initial phase was absent when the frictional instability was strong , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath13 .",
    "the continuum limit entails the relation @xmath14 so that the continuum limit of the bk model under the rsf law necessarily lies in the weak frictional instability regime , and accompanies a long - durating quasi - static nucleation process .    in view of these recent findings on the nucleation phenomena of the 1d bk model under the rsf law ,",
    "we wish to examine in the present paper the statistical properties of subsequent mainshocks themselves , by systematically varying the extent of the model discreteness and various model parameters , paying particular attention to its _ characteristic _ versus _ critical _ features .",
    "the computation of the present paper is an extension of the earlier calculation of ref.@xcite on the same model .",
    "these authors concentrated on the strong frictional instability regime , studying the limited number of observables , _",
    "i.e. _ , the magnitude distribution and the recurrence - time distribution . in the present paper",
    ", we deal with not only the strong frictional instability regime but also the weak frictional instability regime , even including its continuum limit .",
    "note that the weak frictional instability regime is computationally more demanding since it necessarily accompanies a slow nucleation process which requires more computational resources .",
    "we also compute various observables not computed in ref.@xcite , including the rupture - zone size ( rupture length ) distribution , the seismic time correlations before and after the mainshock , the mean slip amount and the mean stress drop at the mainshock , _ etc _ , aimed at reaching deeper understanding of the the nature of seismic events of the model .",
    "we then find that the characteristic feature of mainshocks becomes more pronounced as one moves from the strong to the weak frictional instability regime .",
    "while the magnitude distribution of the model in the strong frictional instability regime of @xmath15 exhibits an almost flat distribution spanning from smaller to larger events as reported in @xcite , the distribution tends to be more peaked at a characteristic magnitude as one moves to the weak frictional instability regime of @xmath16 .",
    "it means that a hypothetical , uniform fault obeying the rsf law tends to exhibit a pronounced characteristic behavior , accompanied by the quasi - periodic recurrence of earthquakes of more or less similar magnitude .",
    "such a characteristic property is in apparent contrast to the power - law critical behavior as embodied by the gr law , but corroborates the rice s claim @xcite .",
    "when one looks at the rupture - length ( @xmath0 ) distribution , a simpler behavior turns out to emerge .",
    "both in the strong and the weak instability regimes , the distribution exhibits an exponential behavior at larger sizes , @xmath1 $ ] , characterized by the characteristic `` _ seismic correlation length _ ''",
    "this observation hints that certain forecast might be possible , at least for a mature homogenous fault , on the basis of such pronounced characteristic features .",
    "it is also observed that not only the mean stress drop but also the mean slip amount at the mainshock tends to be @xmath0-independent for larger events .    events of the model might be classified into two distinct categories , called here the type - i and the type - ii events .",
    "the type - i event tends to occur with its epicenter located at the rim of the rupture zone of the preceding event , and tends to be unilateral , _",
    "i.e. _ , its rupture propagates predominantly into one direction and the epicenter lies near the edge of the rupture zone of the event .",
    "by contrast , the type - ii event tends to occur with its epicenter located in the interior of this event , the rupture propagating into both directions .",
    "the type - ii event has an enhanced characteristic feature than the type - i event .",
    "for example , the type - ii event tends to repeat several times with a more or less common epicenter and rupture zone , with features of the so - called `` asperity '' .",
    "the dominance of either type - i / ii events depends on the weak / strong frictional instability regime , _",
    "i.e. _ , the type - i ( type - ii ) event tends to dominate in the strong ( weak ) frictional instability regime .",
    "the fact that seismic events of the model tend to be increasingly more characteristic in the weaker frictional instability regime might be understood from the dominance of the type - ii event in the weak frictional instability regime .",
    "continuum limit of the model is also examined . since the continuum limit of the model always lies in the weak frictional instability regime of the original discrete model irrespective of its parameter values",
    ", our results suggest that seismic events of a mature homogeneous fault should be more or less `` characteristic '' , with features of asperities .",
    "such enhanced characteristic features enable one to discuss about `` typical scales '' underlying the seismic events , those of length , time and energy .",
    "we then try to give explicit estimates of these scales underlying seismicity .",
    "overall , the properties of the bk model under the rsf law are sometimes considerably different from those of the bk model under the pure velocity - weakening law employed in most of the previous simulations on the bk model @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , characteristic features tend to be more enhanced in the rsf - law model than in the pure velocity - weakening - law model .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define our model , the 1d bk model obeying the rsf law , and present its equation of motion .",
    "in section iii , we report the results of our numerical simulation on various statistical properties of the model , _ e.g. _ , the magnitude distribution , the rupture - length distribution , the mainshock recurrence - time distribution , the seismic time correlations before and after the mainshock , the mean slip amount and the mean stress drop at the mainshock , _ etc _ , covering both the strong and the weak instability regimes . in section iv , we deal with the continuum limit of the model , and investigate how various statistical properties behave in this limit .",
    "finally , section v is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "implications to real seismicity are discussed .",
    "the 1d bk model consists of a 1d array of @xmath17 identical blocks of the mass @xmath18 , which are mutually connected with the two neighboring blocks via the elastic springs of the spring stiffness @xmath19 , and are also connected to the moving plate via the springs of the spring stiffness @xmath20 , and are driven with a constant rate @xmath21 .",
    "all blocks are subject to the friction strength @xmath22 , which is the source of nonlinearity in the model .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath23-th block can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the time , @xmath26 is the displacement of the @xmath23-th block , and @xmath27 is the friction force at the @xmath23-th block . for simplicity ,",
    "the motion in the direction opposite to the plate drive is inhibited by imposing an infinitely large friction for @xmath28 .    for the friction law",
    ", we assume the rsf law given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity of the @xmath23-th block , @xmath31 is the time - dependent state variable ( with the dimension of time ) representing the `` state '' of the slip interface , @xmath32 is a crossover velocity underlying the rsf law , @xmath33 is an effective normal load , @xmath7 is a critical slip distance which is a measure of the sliding distance necessary for the surface to evolve to a new state , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 positive constants describing the rsf law .",
    "the first term ( @xmath35-term ) is a constant taking a value around @xmath36 @xcite , which dominates the total friction in magnitude , the second term ( @xmath37-term ) a velocity - strengthening direct term describing the part of the friction responding immediately to the velocity change , the third part ( @xmath38-term ) an indirect velocity - weakening term dependent of the state variable .",
    "laboratory experiments suggest that the @xmath37- and @xmath38-terms are smaller than the @xmath35-term by one or two orders of magnitudes , yet they play an essential role in stick - slip dynamics @xcite .",
    "note that , in the standard rsf law , the @xmath37-term is often assumed to be proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "obviously , this form becomes pathological in the @xmath40 limit because it gives a negatively divergent friction .",
    "in other words , the pure logarithmic form of the @xmath37-term can not describe the state at a complete rest .",
    "we cure this pathology by phenomenologically introducing a modified form given above @xcite .",
    "the modified form , where the @xmath37-term becomes proportional to the block velocity @xmath5 at @xmath41 but reduces to the purely logarithmic form at @xmath42 , is enable to describe a complete halt .",
    "the characteristic velocity @xmath32 represents a crossover velocity , describing a low - velocity cutoff of the logarithmic behavior of the friction .    for the evolution law of the state variable ,",
    "we use here the so - called aging ( slowness ) law given by @xmath43 under this evolution law , the state variable @xmath44 grows linearly with time at a complete halt @xmath45 reaching a very large value at the outset of the nucleation process , while it decays very rapidly during the seismic rupture .",
    "the equation of motion can be made dimensionless by taking the length unit to be the critical slip distance @xmath7 , the time unit to be @xmath46 and the velocity unit to be @xmath47 , @xmath48 where the dimensionless variables are defined by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , while @xmath58 is the dimensionless elastic stiffness parameter .",
    "it is sometimes more convenient to rewrite the equation of motion in terms of the velocity variable @xmath59 instead of the displacement @xmath60 . by differentiating ( [ eq - motion ] ) with respect to @xmath61 and by using ( [ aging ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath62 the block displacement or the slip amount @xmath60 can be obtained up to a constant by integrating the velocity @xmath59 with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "one sees from eqs.([eq - motion2 ] ) and ( [ aging ] ) that the constant frictional parameter @xmath63 no longer remains in the governing equations , meaning this parameter is essentially irrelevant to the dynamical properties of the model . in our simulations , we use either eqs.([eq - motion ] ) or ( [ eq - motion2 ] ) depending on the situation . in solving the high - speed motion , we use eq.([eq - motion ] ) , while in solving the low - speed motion as realized in the initial phase or the early stage of the acceleration phase , we use eq.([eq - motion2 ] ) .",
    "the frictional parameter @xmath64/@xmath9 tends to suppress / enhance the frictional instability .",
    "the earthquake instability is driven primarily by the velocity - weakening @xmath9-term , while the velocity strengthening @xmath64-term tends to mitigate the unstable slip toward the aseismic slip . since the frictional parameters @xmath64 and @xmath9 compete in their function",
    ", either @xmath65 or @xmath66 might affect the dynamics significantly . when @xmath67 , the compensation effect due to the @xmath64-term tends to induce a slow slip succeeding a mainshock , _",
    "i.e. _ , an afterslip , while , when @xmath68 , it gives rise to slow - slip events ( sse ) , no longer accompanying the high - speed rupture at any stage of the event .",
    "earthquake properties in this regime of @xmath66 will be reported in a separate paper , with emphasis on the slow - slip phenomena .",
    "estimates of typical values of the model parameters representing natural earthquake faults have been given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the bk model and its continuum limit possess a built - in time scale , @xmath69 , corresponding to the typical rise time of an earthquake event , which may be estimated to be @xmath70 [ sec ] .",
    "the model possesses two distinct and independent length scales : one associated with the fault slip and the other with the distance along the fault .",
    "the former length scale is the critical slip distance @xmath7 , which was estimated to be @xmath71 [ cm ] , while the other is the distance the rupture propagates per unit time , @xmath72 , which was estimated to be @xmath73 [ km ] where @xmath74 is the @xmath75-wave velocity in the lvfz .",
    "the spring constant @xmath20 was related to the normal stress as @xmath76 .",
    "then , as @xmath35 is known to take a value around @xmath36 , @xmath63 would be of order @xmath77-@xmath78 , @xmath64 and @xmath9 being one or two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "the crossover velocity @xmath32 and its dimensionless counterpart @xmath79 is hard to estimate though it should be much smaller than unity , and we take it as a parameter .    the continuum limit of the bk model corresponds to making the dimensionless block size @xmath8 to be infinitesimal @xmath80 , simultaneously making the system infinitely rigid @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless distance @xmath82 between the block @xmath23 and @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "since the continuum limit entails @xmath14 , the condition of the weak frictional instability @xmath85 is always satisfied there .",
    "hence , the continuum limit of the model always lies in the weak frictional instability regime accompanying the quasi - static nucleation process .",
    "simulations are made by numerically solving the coupled equtions of motions for @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) by means of the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the total number of blocks @xmath17 is taken to be @xmath88 in most cases , while other sizes up to @xmath89 are studied to check the possible finite - size effects .",
    "open boundary conditions are adopted for the block at each end of the system .",
    "we have checked that the results shown below for the systems size @xmath88 are free from finite - size effects in that the results have well converged against further increase of @xmath17 .",
    "concerning the initial conditions , all blocks are assumed to be ar rest , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath90 ( @xmath87 ) at @xmath91 , the state variable is taken to be uniform @xmath92 , while the displacement of each block is assumed to take random values uniformly distributed between -5 and 5 from block to block .",
    "events at earlier times are just transient and non - stationary , strongly affected by the initial conditions .",
    "we wait until the system reaches the stationary state loosing initial memory , and compute various observables in such stationary states .",
    "we emphasize that , although the model is completely uniform or ` homogenous ' in the model parameters describing its equations of motion , it exhibits quite erratic or irregular behavior as will be shown in subsequent sections .",
    "in other words , the outcoming state of the model , _",
    "e.g. _ , the displacement , the velocity and the stress _ etc . _ , could be quite ` inhomogeneous ' .",
    "the origin of such irregular behaviors lies in the imposed initial conditions inevitably existing in any real setting , from which the irregularity or the complexity is self - evolved via the intrinsic `` chaotic '' dynamics .",
    "in this section , we study various statistical properties of the 1d bk model , including the magnitude distribution , the rupture - length distribution , the recurrence time distribution , the mean slip amount , and the mean stress drop at the mainshock .    we begin with the magnitude distribution .",

    "by contrast , the mechanism is expected to be less effective in 2d simply due to the geometrical reason : the possible paths of the rupture propagation from outside could be far richer in 2d than in 1d so that the high stress state at the epicenter region tends to be more vulnerable to the rupture invasion from outside .",
    "if so , the type - ii event would be more eminent in 1d than in 2d .",

    "the event in the continuum limit of the 1d bk model exhibits pronounced characteristic features , corroborating the argument by rice @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in the parameter range of @xmath172 or @xmath67 , the slow - slip phenomena come into play , considerably changing the character of seismic events . we will deal with such slow - slip regime in a separate paper .",
    "the properties of the bk model under the rsf law are sometimes considerably different from those of the well - studied bk model under the pure velocity - weakening law employed in most of the previous simulations on the model .",
    "namely , characteristic features tend to be more enhanced in the rsf - law model than in the pure velocity - weakening - law model .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that the rsf law possesses an intrinsic length scale in it , the characteristic slip distance , whereas the pure velocity - weakening law does not possess such a length scale .",
    "finally , we wish to discuss possible implications of our present results to real seismicity , by providing rough estimates of various characteristic numbers , on the basis of the estimates of typical time and length scales given in ref.@xcite . of course",
    ", these should be taken only as rough estimates since our model itself is a very crude one .",
    "the characteristic rupture length @xmath2 of seismic events has been estimated to be @xmath173 [ km ] .",
    "this means that event at a hypothetical homogenous infinite fault , events can not be indefinitely large , say , @xmath174 , the upper limit being of order several hundreds till a thousand kilometers .",
    "interestingly , this upperlimit comes close to the rupture length of 1960 chile earthquake of @xmath175 [ km ] .",
    "events in the continuum limit tend to possess a character of asperity event ( type - ii in our notation ) even in the completely homogeneous parameter setting , and tend to repeat quasi - periodically .",
    "the typical recurrence time can be estimated from fig.15 to be 100@xmath140300 in dimensionless units , which , in the dimensionful number , corresponds to a few hundred years with the typical @xmath176-value of order a few [ cm ] per year .",
    "the typical slip amount might be estimated from fig.17(a ) to be 100@xmath140300 in dimensionless units , which , in the dimensionful number , corresponds to a few [ m ] .",
    "these numbers seem quite reasonable ones expected for large interplate earthquakes occurring at a mature interplate fault .",
    "another interesting observation of the present study is that not only the mean stress drop but also the mean slip tends to be rupture - length ( @xmath0 ) independent for larger events .",
    "such a saturation of @xmath0 is similar to the one expected in the so - called `` @xmath141-model '' , which was supported by large strike - slip earthquakes at natural faults @xcite .",
    "indeed , our fig.17 suggests that such a saturation occurs around @xmath177 in the dimensionless units , which corresponds in real seismicity to large events of @xmath178 [ km ] .",
    "interestingly , such a saturation of the mean slip amount against the rupture length was indeed reported .",
    "for example ,",
    "fig.1(a ) of ref.@xcite suggests that the slip amount tends to saturate for longer rupture length of @xmath179 [ km ] .    in this way ,",
    "an important message from the present study is that , _ at least in a mature homogeneous fault obeying the rsf law , events tend to be eminently characteristic _ with characteristic length , time and energy scales . our present model is 1d rather than 2d , which might over - emphasize the characteristic feature of the associated seismicity . yet",
    ", our preliminary calculation on the corresponding 2d bk model suggests that the model keeps enhanced characteristic features in the continuum limit even in 2d .",
    "this observation would mean that , at least when one looks at a single mature homogenous fault , say , nankai trough , earthquakes might be strongly characteristic , with peaked distributions in various observables .",
    "indeed , such model observations appear to be supported by seismic observations on mature interplate faults @xcite .    of course",
    ", if ones looks at real seismicity , things often could be much more complex and erratic .",
    "earthquake statistics is often characterized by power - laws without any characteristic scales as seen in , _",
    "e.g. _ , the celebrated gr law . then",
    ", an emerging , highly important fundamental question would be what is the true origin of the observed `` complexity '' and apparently `` critical '' ( power - law ) behavior of real earthquakes .",
    "the answer to this question might not necessarily be unique .",
    "one possible factor might be the `` inhomogeneity '' .",
    "this has already be seen even in the present homogenous model in the form of the block discreteness .",
    "we have observed that the things tend to be more characteristic as one approaches the continuum limit .",
    "enhanced discreteness drives the system toward the strong frictional instability regime where the things tend to be more erratic or critical , as emphasized by rice many years ago @xcite .",
    "of course , a real fault can not be completely homogeneous even at a single fault , and there could be various forms and levels of inhomogeneity .",
    "concerning the gr law , one plausible scenario of its origin might be the following : if one looks at events occurring at a single mature interplate fault , the magnitude distribution might indeed deviate from the gr law , possibly with a peak or some structure appearing at a magnitude value characteristic of that fault , whereas , if one takes an average over many different faults with different material parameters as is usually done in taking statistics , the characteristic magnitude scales compensate with each other , eventually leading to the unpeaked distribution apparently without any characteristic magnitude scale @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the original soc mechanism of producing the seismic `` criticality '' , but a similar mechanism of producing power - laws or scale - invariance has been known in statistical physics and solid - state physics , especially in random and inhomogeneous systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , the glass ( spin glass , structural glass , _ etc . _ ) problem @xcite .    as the constitutive law",
    ", we have used the rsf law , now standard in seismology .",
    "our knowledge of the friction law , however , is still limited , especially in the high - speed regime , so that there always remains a possibility that the deviation from the rsf law gives the resulting earthquake events certain critical features . indeed , our previous simulations employing the velocity - weakening friction law yielded the seismic events with more enhanced critical features @xcite .    in any case , we hope that the present results on the 1d bk model under the rsf law would provide a useful reference in understanding the complex earthquake phenomena .",
    "further extensions would be desirable in several directions .",
    "one is an extension to 2d .",
    "the 2d model possesses a richer geometry , and might modify some part of the present results .",
    "the second might be to take account of the degrees of freedom along the perpendicular - to - fault direction into the model . in the bk model , while the deformable fault layer is represented by an assembly of blocks , the perpendicular degrees of freedom are largely suppressed or simplified in that the block assembly is directly pulled by the moving rigid plate via only one layer of elastic springs .",
    "although such a simplification might work for a mature interplate fault with a well - developed lvfz , in order to evaluate the generality of the properties of the bk model , it might be interesting to examine the effect of the perpendicular - to - fault degrees of freedom neglected in the original bk model by appropriately extending it .",
    "the third might be to study the effect of inhomogeneity of various forms and levels , a part of which we discussed above .",
    "the last is to study the slow - slip phenomena within the bk model . indeed",
    ", our preliminary simulations suggest that the sse could be describable even within the bk model .",
    "then , it would be highly intersting to study the inter - relation between the sse and the usual high - speed rupture within a single framework of the simple bk model to get deeper insight into general seismicity .    as such , the bk model , in spite of its long history and its apparent simplicity , still remains to be a fruitful model involving rich physics to be uncovered .",
    "it provides us a useful reference point in understanding basic physical processes underlying apparently complex earthquake phenomena .",
    "the authors are thankful to h. kanamori , n. kato , n. hatano , t. uchide , and t. okubo for useful discussion .",
    "they are thankful to issp , the university of tokyo for providing us with cpu time .",
    "this study is supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research no.16k13851 , and by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan , under its earthquake and volcano hazards observation and research program ."
