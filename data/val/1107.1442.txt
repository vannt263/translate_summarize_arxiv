    "a deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) molecule is a linear heteropolymer whose monomeric subunits , called nucleotides , are denoted by the four letters a , t , c and g. the sequence of these nucleotides in a dna molecule chemically encodes genetic informations . in the nucleus of an eukaryotic cell",
    ", dna is stored in a hierarchically organized structure called chromatin @xcite .",
    "the primary repeating unit of chromatin at the lowest level of the hierarchical structure is a nucleosome @xcite .",
    "the cylindrically shaped core of each nucleosome consists of an octamer of histone proteins around which 146 base pairs ( i.e.,@xmath1 nm ) of the the double stranded dna is wrapped about two turns ( more precisely , 1.7 helical turns ) ; the arrangement is reminiscent of wrapping of a thread around a spool .",
    "there are @xmath2 equispaced sites , at intervals of @xmath3 base pairs ( bp ) , on the surface of the cylindrical spool .",
    "electrostatic attraction between these binding sites on the histone spool and the oppositely charged dna seems to dominate the histone - dna interactions which stabilize the nucleosomes . throughout this paper , the helical curve formed by the histone - dna overlap",
    "will be called the `` footprint '' .",
    "the dna stores the genetic blueprint of an organism .",
    "if nucleosomes were static , segments of dna buried in nucleosomes would not be accessible for various functions involving the corresponding gene @xcite .",
    "however , in reality , nucleosomes are dynamic .",
    "spontaneous dynamics of nucleosomes are usually consequences of thermal fluctuations whereas the active dynamic processes are driven by special purpose molecular machines called chromatin remodeling enzymes ( cre ) fuelled by atp @xcite",
    ". various aspects of chromatin dynamics has received some attention of theoretical modelers , including physicists , over the last few years @xcite .",
    "in general , `` chromatin remodelling '' refers to a range of enzyme mediated structural transitions that occur during gene regulation in eukaryotic cells . to make dna , which is wrapped around histone octamer , accessible for various dna - dependent processes",
    ", it is always necessary to rearrange or mobilize the nucleosomes . in principle , there are at least four different ways in which a cre can affect the nucleosomes @xcite : ( i ) _ sliding _ the histone octamer , i.e. , repositioning of the entire histone spool , on the dsdna ; ( ii ) _ exchange _ of one or more of the histone subunits of the spool with those in the surrounding solution ( also called _ replacement _ of histones ) ( iii ) _ removal _ of one or more of the histone subunits of the spool , leaving the remaining subunits intact , and ( iv ) complete _ ejection _ of the whole histone octamer without replacement . our theoretical work here is closely related to _",
    "sliding_.    in the next section",
    "we describe a scenario in which either a cre motor ( or , other atp - dependent motors that translocate along dsdna ) traverse the `` footprint '' . because of the stochasticity of the underlying mechano - chemical kinetics , the _ footprint traversal time _ ( ftt )",
    "is a fluctuating random variable . extending an earlier model developed by chou @xcite",
    ", we analytically calculate the _ mean _ ftt ( mftt ) of the cre motor .    to our surprise",
    ", we found that the atp - dependence of the various atp - driven activities of cres have not been studied systematically in the published literature .",
    "in particular , we address the question : how does the mftt of a cre motor vary with the variation of the concentration of atp ?",
    "this rate is not necessarily directly proportional to the rate of atp hydrolysis by the cre because the mechanical sliding of the nucleosome need not be tightly coupled with the hydrolysis of atp by the cre .",
    "therefore , we develope here an analytical theory predicting the atp - dependence of the atp - dependent footprint - traversal by cre . we hope our result will stimulate systematic experimental investigations on the atp - dependence of atp - dependent cres .",
    "chromatin is not a frozen static aggregate of dna and proteins .",
    "spontaneous thermal fluctuations can cause a transient unwrapping and rewrapping of the nucleosomal dna from one end of the nucleosome spool ; the corresponding rates for an isolated single nucleosome are , typically , @xmath4s@xmath5 and @xmath6s@xmath5 , respectively @xcite . in other words , once wrapped fully , the nucleosomal dna remains in that state for about @xmath7ms before unwrapping again spontaneously ; however , it waits in the unwrapped state only for about @xmath8ms before rewrapping again spontaneously .",
    "surprisingly , the accessibility of the nucleosomal dna is only modestly affected if instead of a single nucleosome the experiment is repeated with an array of homogeneously distributed nucleosomes @xcite .",
    "moreover , folding of an array of nucleosomes makes the linker dna about @xmath9 times less accessible @xcite .",
    "furthermore , on the nucleosomal dna , the farther is a site from the entry and exit points , the longer one has to wait to access it by the rarer spontaneous fluctuation of sufficiently large size @xcite .",
    "thus , nucleosomal dna far from both the entry and exit sites is practically inaccessible by spontaneous thermal fluctuations .",
    "can a nucleosome slide _ spontaneously _ by thermal fluctuations thereby exposing the nucleosomal dna ?",
    "interestingly , spontaneous repositioning of nucleosome on dna strands is a well known phenomenon @xcite .",
    "how can one reconcile accessibility of nucleosomal dna by such repositioning @xcite with the difficulty of access by unwrapping from either end of the spool @xcite ? if the dna were to move unidirectionally along its own superhelical contour on the surface of the histone , at every step it would have to first _",
    "transiently _ detach simultaneously from all the @xmath2 binding sites and then reattach at the same sites after its contour gets shifted by @xmath3 bp ( or multiples of @xmath3 bp ) .",
    "but , the energy cost of the simultaneous detachment of the dna from all the @xmath2 binding sites is prohibitively large because the total energy of binding at the @xmath2 sites is about @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "but , why ca nt the cylindrical spool simply roll on the wrapped nucleosomal dna thereby repositioning itself ?",
    "if the nucleosome rolls by detaching dna from one end of the spool , can not it compensate this loss of binding energy by simulataneous attachment with a binding at the other end ?",
    "if such an energy compensation were possible , detachment from only one binding site would be required at a time .",
    "but , the cylindrical spool has a finite size on which only a finite number ( @xmath2 ) of binding sites for dna are accomodated . therefore , by rolling over the dna the spool would not offer any vacant binding site to the dna with which it can bind .",
    "this rolling mechanism would successfully lead to spontaneous sliding of the nucleosome only if the histone spool were infinite with an infinite sequence of binding sites for dna on its surface @xcite .",
    "we now describe a plausible mechanism for spontaneous sliding of a nucleosome @xcite . in the process of normal `` breathing '' ,",
    "most often the spontaneously unwrapped flap rewraps exactly to its original position on the histone surface . however , if the rewrapping of a unwrapped flap takes place at a slightly displaced location on the histone spool a small bulge ( or loop ) of dna forms on the surface of the histones .",
    "since the successive binding sites are separated by @xmath3bp , the length of the loop is quantized in the multiples of @xmath3bp @xcite .",
    "such a spontaneously created dna loop , can diffuse in an unbiased manner on the surface of the histone spool . in the beginning of each step dna from one end of the loop detaches from the histone spool , but the consequent energy loss is made up by the attachment of dna at the other end of the loop to the histone spool before the step is completed .",
    "consequently , by this diffusive dynamics , the dna loop can traverse the entire length of the @xmath2 binding sites on the histone spool of a nucleosome which will manifest as sliding of the nucleosome by a length that is exactly equal to the length of dna in the loop .",
    "the diffusing dna bulge can be formed by a `` twist '' , rather than bending , of dna @xcite .",
    "spontaneous sliding of a nucleosome , however , is too slow to support intranuclear processes which need access to nucleosomal dna .",
    "it is now widely agreed that atp - dependent active remodeling of nucleosome can account for the fast sliding of nucleosomes .",
    "nevertheless , bulging dna loop is expected to play a key role in the remodeling process @xcite .",
    "our model describes how a cre motor can wedge itself at the fork between the histone spool and a transiently detached segment of dsdna and , by exploiting the spontaneously diffusing loop by an atp - dependent ratcheting , traverse the footprint in a directed manner .",
    "because of the intrinsic stochasticity of the mechano - chemistry of the cre and that of the diffusive motion of the dna loop , the overall motion of the cre is noisy and the time it takes to traverse the footprint is random .",
    "the main question we address in this paper is the following : if @xmath11 is the mftt , what is the dependence of @xmath11 on the concentration of atp in the surrounding aqueous medium ? to our knowledge , in the published literature neither systematic experiments nor any analytical theory has addressed this question . in this paper , by extending chou s model @xcite of cre , we capture the role of atp explicitly and derive an analytical expression for the dependence of @xmath11 on the concentration of atp .",
    "a cre may be regarded as a molecular motor where input energy is derived from atp hydrolysis and the output is mechanical work .",
    "the directed movement of the cre may be caused either by a _ power stroke _ or by a _",
    "brownian ratchet _",
    "mechanism @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of the atp - dependent cre motor is formulated in our model in terms of a set of master equations .",
    "the kinetic scheme can be interpreted in terms of both power stroke and brownian ratchet mechanisms .",
    "one interesting question @xcite in the context of cre is whether the cre translocates along the dna by moving around the nucleosome , or whether the cre anchors on the histone octamer and `` pumps '' dna by pulling around the octamer . from the perspective of physicists",
    ", these two alternative scenarios can be viewed as merely a change of frame of reference- one is fixed with respect to the dna whereas the other is fixed with respect to the cre .",
    "therefore , we describe the operation of the cre with respect to a reference frame with respect to which the cre translocates along the dna ; but , the model can be reformulated by a coordinate transformation so as to capture the alternative scenario where the cre pumps the dna .",
    "we model a mono nucleosome where a dsdna is wrapped one - and - three - fourth turn around a disc - shaped spool made of histone proteins ( see fig.[fig - spool](a ) ) . following chou @xcite",
    ", we consider the scenario where the cre `` wedges itself underneath the histone '' .",
    "the sites of histone - dna contact along the dna chain is represented as a one - dimensional lattice . therefore , the lattice constant is , typically , @xmath3 bp ( ( see fig.[fig - spool](b ) ) .",
    "the total number @xmath12 of lattice sites is equal to the total number of histone - dna contact in a single nucleosome .      in this subsection",
    "we present a summary of chou s ideas @xcite which we need in the next subsection where we extend chou s model . here",
    "we consider the simple situation when no cre is present and the kinetics of the system is governed solely by spontaneous thermal fluctuations . because of these fluctuations , from either end of the histone - dna contact region , small segments of dna momentarily unwrap from the histone spool at a rate @xmath13 . for energetic reasons ,",
    "the most likely length of such a segment would be one lattice spacing , i.e. , about @xmath3bp .",
    "following chou @xcite , we call such unwrapped segments a `` flap ''",
    ". the rate of the reverse transition , in which re - binding of the dna flap with the histone , takes place at a rate @xmath14 .",
    "a flap need not re - make the original histone - dna contact . instead , by pulling in an extra segment of the dna , its next segment can bind with the last binding site on the histone spool , with rate @xmath15 thereby forming what chou @xcite referred to as a ",
    "loop. while located at either end of the lattice , a loop can revert to a flap at a rate @xmath16 .",
    "the rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 are well approximated by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy cost of bending the dna into the shape of the loop .",
    "a loop can step forward or backward . in the _ absence _ of any cre ,",
    "the rates of the forward and backward steppings of the loop are equal ( denoted by @xmath19 ) , provided the size of the loop @xmath20 remains unaltered ( see fig.[fig - diffn1 ] ) ; in each forward step it unwraps one segment of dna from the histone in the direction of its hop and re - wraps another equally long segment behind it .",
    "therefore , one can approximate @xmath19 by @xcite @xmath21    when a loop , after entering the lattice from one end , makes an eventual exit from the other end , it completes the `` sliding '' of the histone spool by a distance @xmath20 along the dna in the opposite direction .",
    "therefore , from the perspective of the sliding histone spool , its effective rate of hopping by a step of size @xmath20 along the dsdna strand is the same as the rate @xmath22 at which a dna loop of length @xmath20 traverses the lattice of @xmath12 sites from one end to the other .",
    "suppose @xmath23 denotes the probability that the loop is located at @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "following chou s arguments , based on master equations for @xmath23 , one gets @xcite @xmath26 in the absence of a cre , the traversal of a dna loop of length @xmath20 from left to right is as likely as that from right to left .",
    "therefore , the histone spool can slide forward or backward , with equal rate @xmath27 , by a step of size @xmath20 .",
    "as we ll see in the next subsection , peeling off of the dna from the histone spool by a cre motor keeps decreasing the effective value of @xmath12 which , in turn , increases the effective sliding rate @xmath22 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of dna loop diffusion on the atp - dependent translocation kinetics of a cre . the model and results presented in this subsection are extensions of chou s work @xcite by incorporating explicitly a brownian ratchet mechanism for cre motors .    as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we assume that the step size of the cre motor is identical to the length of the thermally generated dna loop .",
    "therefore , the mechanical movements of the cre motor can be described as that of a `` particle '' on the one - dimensional lattice on which the equi - spaced sites denote the histone - dna contact points .",
    "we denote the position of the cre motor on this lattice by the integers @xmath28 .",
    "we now extend chou s model @xcite by exploiting a superficial similarity with the garai - chowdhury - betterton ( gcb ) model @xcite for the brownian ratchet mechanism of monomeric helicase motors .",
    "a dna helicase unwinds a dsdna and translocates along one of two strands . at any arbitrary instant of time",
    ", the configuration of the system looks very similar to that shown in fig.[fig - spool](b ) except that the surface of the dna spool and the dsdna would be replaced by the two strands of the dsdna itself .",
    "the lattice constant is @xmath29bp in the case of a helicase whereas it is about @xmath3 bp in fig.[fig - spool](b ) . in the brownian ratchet mechanism , momentary local unwinding of a segment ,",
    "typically , @xmath29 bp long , takes place at the fork by spontaneous thermal fluctuation ; the opportunistic advance of the helicase merely prevents closure of the segment .",
    "similarly , in the brownian ratchet mechanism of the cre , the cre is assumed to `` wedge '' itself just in front of the dna - histone fork .",
    "the cre motor can move forward only if the segment in front of it is unwrapped by thermal fluctuation .",
    "the mechano - chemical cycle of the cre is captured in our model exactly the same way in which that of the helicase was formulated in the gcb model @xcite .",
    "we assume that sequence of states in each mechano - chemical cycle of a cre can be combined into two distinct groups which we label by the integers @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see fig.[fig - omega1221 ] ) .",
    "the allowed transitions and the corresponding rate constants are shown in fig.[fig - model1 ] .",
    "the physical processes captured by these rate constants can be motivated by a comparison with the abstract brownian ratchet mechanism , illustrated in fig.[fig - brrat ] .",
    "atp hydrolysis by the cre drives its transition from the state @xmath29 to the state @xmath30 at a rate @xmath31 . let us assume that the motor experiences two different types of potentials in the states @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "let us further assume that initially the periodic potential , with asymmetric sawtooth - like period , is kept on for sometime and during this time the motor settles at a position that coincides with one of the minima of this potential .",
    "now if this potential is switched off then the probability distribution of the position of the motor will spread as a symmetric gaussian . after sometime this gaussian profile is broad enough to overlap with the next well ( shadded region in the fig.[fig - brrat ] ) , in addition to the original well .",
    "now if the sawtooth potential is again switched on then , with a non - zero probability ( that is proportional to the area of the shaded region ) the motor will find itself in the next well .",
    "our model accounts for this possibility with the transition associated with the rate constant @xmath32 .",
    "there is also a finite probability that the particle stays back in its original well ; this is captured by the transition with the rate constant @xmath33 .",
    "the cre motor would step forward at the rate @xmath34 if the next site in front is cleared .",
    "but if the next site is not cleared and it has to wait for the unwrapping of the dna segment by thermal fluctuation .",
    "consequently , its _ effective _ hoping rate @xmath35 is reduced from the free hopping rate @xmath32 by a factor that depends on both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    when a diffusing loop reaches in front of the motor it momentarily creates a flap of two bond segments .",
    "three different transitions are now possible ( see fig.[fig - fate ] ) : ( i ) the motor s position remains unaltered while the two open segments close , ( ii ) the motor moves forward by one step while one segment of the flap closes ; ( iii ) the motor moves forward by two steps and the flap can not close .",
    "the rate for the process ( i ) is @xmath38 irrespective of the `` chemical '' state of the motor .",
    "however , the rates of the processes ( ii ) and ( iii ) depend on whether the motor was in the `` chemical '' state @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "if the motor is in the state @xmath30 , the rate of the process ( ii ) is given by @xmath39 and that of the process ( iii ) is given by @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 with the normalization constant @xmath42 where the symbols @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the probabilities of the processes ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) above when the motor is in the `` chemical '' state @xmath30",
    ". similarly , @xmath46 with the normalization constant @xmath47 are the corresponding probabilities , when the motor is in the `` chemical '' state @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath12 is the distance between the motor and the far end of histone - dna contact .",

    "obviously , @xmath75 is the solution of the equations for @xmath77 with the initial condition @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , the time - evolution of @xmath75 can be re - cast as @xmath79 @xmath80 where the transition rates @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on the value of @xmath12 as follows :    for @xmath83 + @xmath84 + for n = n + @xmath85 + for @xmath86 + @xmath87 + for @xmath88 + @xmath89 + for @xmath90 + @xmath91 +    the master equations ( [ eq - s1])-([eq - s2 ] ) together , effectively , correspond to the kinetic scheme shown in the fig .",
