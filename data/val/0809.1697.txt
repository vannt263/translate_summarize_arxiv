    "oscillation is ubiquitous in nature , not only in physics and chemistry but also biology .",
    "biological oscillations can be observed over a wide range of time- and population - scales , from a circadian rhythm of about 24 hours  @xcite to a segmentation clock of less than 2 hours  @xcite , from whole - body oscillatory fevers  @xcite to periodic protein production in a single cell  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "sound theoretical studies have been undergoing since long before the observation became possible in molecular level .",
    "there are many theoretical models to explain these phenomena . despite their diversity of biological insights , these models share some common points .",
    "proteins are produced by the transcription and translation of specific sequences of dna .",
    "on the other hand , proteins can bind to a transcription promotor on dna and hence suppress or enhance gene expression .",
    "a transcriptional negative feedback loop  @xcite and a delay  @xcite in the inner cellular gene - protein network are considered to be important elements that contribute to the oscillatory expression of dna and protein production . from the perspectives of dynamical systems , such oscillations are limit cycles that can be generated from hopf bifurcation by choosing an appropriate parameter set and initial condition .",
    "consequently , in the case of a cell group or multi - cellular organism with an oscillatory character , such as cardiac tissue and a segmentation clock in the tail of psm ( presomitic mesoderm ) , the synchronization of coupled oscillators is often used to explain the observed collective oscillation  @xcite .",
    "however , periodic oscillation is only a small part of the dynamical behavior of a cell .",
    "oscillation may cease if the conditions are changed , and most cells tend to settle into a seeming stable state .",
    "for example , electrical activity in @xmath0-cells exhibits slow periodic oscillation at the macro scale of islets of langerhans , while much faster excitability instead of oscillation when isolated  @xcite . in another example",
    ", the three proteins ( kaia , kaib , and kaic ) , identified as important for the circadian rhythms in cyanobacterium _ synechococcus elongates _ , behave as a bistable toggle switch due to a double - negative - feedback loop .",
    "oscillation could then arise from the successive switch between these two stable steady - states  @xcite .",
    "moreover , most recent studies also suggested that negative transcriptional feedback is not sufficient , and in some cases not even necessary , for circadian oscillation .",
    "instead , intracellular signaling , such as that involving ca@xmath1 and camp , together with transcriptional feedback plays a key role in long - term circadian pacemaking  @xcite .",
    "these evidences raise the possibility that intrinsic oscillatory cells are not indispensable in an oscillatory organism .    in this paper , we study the occurrence of collective oscillation from non - oscillatory system .",
    "in contrast to the conventional mechanism of synchronized oscillators , none of the individual cells in our model is intrinsically oscillatory .",
    "a few studies in the context of mathematics and physics have revealed the possibility of collective oscillating patterns .",
    "the first example was proposed by smale  @xcite , who found that two `` dead '' cells can become `` alive '' via diffusive coupling .",
    "more recently , other studies have examined this behavior in detail  @xcite . in - phase and anti - phase self - sustained oscillation of excitable membrane via bulk coupling",
    "have been observed  @xcite .",
    "the models considered in these reports have mostly involved coupled identical excitable cells with mono - stability .",
    "some more complicated approaches include , for example , using a unidirectional coupling scheme  @xcite , applying a periodic stimulation  @xcite , coupling the system with an oscillatory boundary  @xcite , introducing heterogeneity into excitable media  @xcite , activity propagating in discrete cellular automata model  @xcite , and so forth .",
    "a commonly used idea is to set isolated cells at a subthreshold quiescent state , and then push them over into the oscillatory regime to generate pacemaker cells by extra force or coupling .",
    "that means cells are possible to manifest themselves as oscillators .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to the emergence of oscillation in systems that are completely independent of oscillating elements . unlike previous studies , geometrical structure of nullclines of cells in our model prevent dynamics from being oscillation .",
    "there are two `` engines '' in our model to drive the self - sustained collective oscillation , neither of which is oscillatory pacemaker .",
    "the one is bistable cell switching between two stable states , the other is mono - stable cell with excitability .",
    "two engines work cooperatively due to the wave propagation .    on the other hand , in a bistable system",
    ", a stationary front can bifurcate into a pair of fronts that propagate in opposite directions , which is known as non - equilibrium ising - bloch ( nib ) bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "perturbation for the occurrence of nib bifurcation can be induced by local spatial inhomogeneity  @xcite .",
    "a more global analysis showed that the nib point is only part of the story , and concluded that an unstable wave front is intrinsic to media that are spatially inhomogeneous  @xcite .",
    "an unstable wave front may manifest itself as a reflected front , tango wave  @xcite , pacemaker  @xcite and so on . in this paper , we think about these phenomena beyond mathematics and physics , and extend their application to biological oscillators .    moreover ,",
    "although most studies have been performed on a spatial continuum described by partial differential equations ( pde ) , continuum models neglect the effects of cellular discreteness  @xcite .",
    "in fact , from the viewpoint of biology , the size of cells can not decreased infinitely .",
    "this intrinsic property is difficult to ignore , especially at the stage of initial development of an organism , when the cell size is comparable to that of tissue .",
    "in addition , there are mathematical reasons to explore the system dynamics with spatial discretization .",
    "pde and ode ( ordinary differential equations ) have different theoretical frameworks and produce different results .",
    "several significant features of discreteness , such as _ wave propagation failure _",
    "@xcite , can not occur in a continuum model .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will consider an array of spatially discrete cells , and discuss the impact of discreteness .",
    "in this paper , we consider cells in one - dimensional space .",
    "cells are coupled by intracellular signaling molecules , which flow through channels in a membrane due to concentration difference or depolarization - mediated flux .",
    "the intracellular signaling small - molecule can be produced by a series of process from some genes functioned as activator , and then trigger transcriptional feedback loops of adjacent cells .",
    "we assume that the coupling interaction takes place in a diffusion - like manner .",
    "if we include an inhibitor , which can locally repress the expression of activator genes , a one - dimensional array of @xmath2 cells can be described as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are concentration of activator and inhibitor , respectively , @xmath6 is the index of the cell in the chain and @xmath7 is the coupling strength of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are corresponding reaction functions .",
    "the boundary condition is zero flux , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "finally , @xmath12 is an environmental parameter , which will be discussed in detail later .    in this study , we only consider coupling of the activator . for most of the models that have been used to study pattern formation , diffusion is assumed to occur for every elements .",
    "specially , much greater diffusion of the inhibitor is necessary to induce turing instability  @xcite .",
    "however , a cells membrane is very selective for passage of substances .",
    "complicated intracellular reactions usually take place locally , but are triggered by only one or a few specific signaling molecules . for example , while the segmentation clock involves the cyclic expression of many genes , the crucial pathway for coupling only involves the transmembrane receptor notch1  @xcite . thus ,",
    "in the context of biology , we only consider coupling with the activator , and the inhibitor in our model is merely a local state variable .",
    "the development of a multicellular organism begins with a single cell , which divides and gives rise to cells with different typologies .",
    "different cells are organized according to certain secreted chemicals , called morphogens . despite improvements in experimental and theoretical approaches , the mechanisms of morphogenesis are still unclear .",
    "usually , morphogens are considered to be produced at specific sites and diffuse through the organism  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , evidence of a `` shuttling - based '' mechanism has been presented  @xcite .",
    "the key in such models is their ability to define a robust and scaling profile , usually a concentration gradient , of morphogens .",
    "more broadly , we can suppose that some environmental parameters act as morphogens .",
    "the environment in which an organism develops supplies nutrition for growth , and the intracellular volume in direct contact with the border gets more and that deep inside cells gets less .    in this paper",
    ", we do not consider any specific chemical substance , and instead merely suppose that there is a certain factor , which we refer to as the _ active factor _ , to obtain information regarding the relation between position and cell dynamics .",
    "the above - mentioned active factors can affect the fate of cells in a concentration dependent manner  @xcite .    without losing generality , we assume that the active factor @xmath13 is constant at the boundaries of an organism , where the source site of morphogens are usually located .",
    "it diffuses into the organism field with a diffusion constant @xmath14 , and is degraded at rate @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath16 since our model is based on coupled odes independent of spatial variation , the profile of the active factor satisfies a scaling property . by normalizing the field size to one ,",
    "we can get a steady profile ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath13 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the value at two boundaries , and @xmath20 is the inverse of the decay length . a typical profile of @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "circles indicate the value of @xmath13 for discrete cells ( @xmath22 in the figure ) placed uniformly in the scaling field .",
    "obtained from eq.([eq : gamma - profile ] ) , when @xmath23 . ]",
    "we assume that cells normally prefer to live in a stable state , and cells with a high concentration of active factor are capable of switching between two states .",
    "this kind of bistability is very important and has been observed in various biological systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , the expression of the _ dictyostelium _ camp phosphodiesterase gene behave as a bistable switch employing intracellular camp as a regulator of cell fate  @xcite , the cdc2 activation system in xenopus egg extracts is bistable and characterized by biochemical hysteresis  @xcite , the inducible _ lac _ operon in _",
    "e. coli _ shows bistability  @xcite , and so on .",
    "usually , bistability arises from positive , or double - negative genetic regulation loops  @xcite .",
    "it was recently suggested that stochastic fluctuation plays an important role in the nature of the transition between bistable states  @xcite .",
    "moreover , physical regulation of protein production , which has been much less considered by biochemists , also plays an important role in the origin of the bistability .",
    "it has been observed that discrete transition between folding and unfolding states , namely a first - order phase transition , can take place in giant dna  @xcite .",
    "similar discrete switch can also occur for rna  @xcite , protein  @xcite and other molecules  @xcite .",
    "this discrete transition leads to the on / off switching of the production of a specific protein .",
    "we describe the dynamical reaction function of each cell by using the two - component fitzhugh - nagumo equations @xmath24 where @xmath4 is a variable related to the expression level of specific activator genes , @xmath5 is the inhibitor to repress @xmath4 , @xmath25 , which is much smaller than 1 , is the slower growth factor of inhibitor @xmath5 and @xmath13 is the active factor discussed previously . note that the kinetics of inhibitor here is a rather natural unit process in many of biochemical reactions . throughout this paper ,",
    "the following parameters are fixed @xmath26 the fitzhugh - nagumo model has been well studied for description of excitable behavior in biology .",
    "rich nonlinear dynamics can be observed by tuning parameters .",
    "specifically , with the above parameters , the model is mono - stable at small value of @xmath13 , and will happen a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath27 and a hopf bifurcation at @xmath28 , which leads to bistability .",
    "thus , in the case of the spatial profile of @xmath12 as shown in fig .  [ fig : gamma ] , only the 8 central cells ( 7@xmath29 - 14@xmath29 ) are mono - stable , while the others are bistable ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : onoff](a)&(b ) show the nullclines with bistability and mono - stability for when @xmath13 is large and small , respectively .",
    "again , none of the cells show oscillation in the absence of coupling .",
    "more important , from the geometry property of nullclines in the figure , no oscillatory condition could be found by moving cubic nullcline ( @xmath31 ) up and down .",
    "that is , no pacemaker cells can be generated from activator coupling .",
    "if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : fhn1]&[eq : fhn2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : chain1]&[eq : chain2 ] ) , we get the system equations used in this paper . @xmath32 when we change the coupling strength @xmath7 , we observe the occurrence , variation and disappearance of self - sustained collective oscillation in the cell array .",

    "initially , ( @xmath37 ) , a traveling wave appears due to excitation at the border .",
    "the traveling front then sweeps over the cell array and makes all of the cells excited ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wave-1p](b ) ) .",
    "although the central cells are also turned on due to the interaction with other cells , they can not stay in the excitable state for a long time .",

    "in addition , there is another threshold , which is even smaller , for which the _ wave front _ stops propagating . in this case",
    ", the excited signal at the border fails to propagate forward , but we would like to postpone this interesting phenomenon on another paper , since it is less related to present work .      with an increase in the coupling strength @xmath7 , the characteristics of oscillation can be changed .",
    "figure  [ fig : antiphase_osc ] shows that the position of oscillation periodically shifts .",
    "the 3@xmath38 and 18@xmath29 cells oscillate with a nearly doubled period , in anti - phase ( fig .",

    "[ fig : inphase_osc ] . for comparison with the case of @xmath41 , although the critical interface between on and off shifts periodically as in fig .",
    "[ fig : antiphase_osc ] , there is no phase difference between the 3@xmath38 and 18@xmath29 cells . as is clearly shown in their waveform ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inphase_osc](b , c ) ) , these two boundary cells oscillate in - phase , instead of anti - phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : antiphase_osc](b , c ) ) . therefore , in the present condition , a periodic change does not take place in the position of oscillation .",
    "instead , the population of oscillating cells changes .",
    "more precisely , tissue oscillates in two groups : no .",
    "18 ( 16 cells ) and no .  4-no .",
    "17 ( 14 cells ) , respectively .    moreover , by setting the initial condition of the cells identically , i.e. , all in the on state at @xmath42",
    ", we found checked that same symmetric collective oscillation can also occur in the case of @xmath41 . therefore , we conclude that these two types of oscillation are caused by the same bifurcation .",
    "because the wavefront propagates faster with larger @xmath7 , a larger coupling strength can reduce the time lag between the two boundary cells being stimulated .",
    "if the time lag is smaller , the two boundaries converge to in - phase oscillation . on the other hand , if the time lag is large , they will exhibit anti - phase oscillation .      .",
    "black and white indicate @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "( a ) @xmath45 , oscillation starts to collapse ; ( b ) @xmath46 , oscillation ceases after one cycle . ]    with a increase in coupling strength @xmath7 , we observed that the change in the periodic position or population stopped , and normal oscillation returned . in comparison to the case of @xmath47 ,",
    "the total population of oscillating cells increased from 14 ( no .  4 to no .",
    "17 ) to 16 ( no .  3",
    "the oscillation suddenly dies when @xmath7 is as large as 2.6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : osc_death](b ) clearly shows that the central cells start to oscillate after all of the cells are excited , but this oscillation is not sustained . in this strong coupling condition , the boundary cells can not recover their excitability , so that the wave front propagating from the center is unable to stop and reflect to generate successive oscillation .",
    "before the oscillation stops , there is a narrow parameter region of @xmath48 , where only one side of the `` wall '' alternatively collapses , and a complicated period-4 collective oscillation is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osc_death](a ) ) .",
    "there are many factors that may influence the oscillation behavior .",
    "for example , if the spatial profile of active factor @xmath13 becomes more `` steep '' rather than a gentle slope , the wave back will tend to be locked and fail to reflect from boundary .",
    "moreover , if we reduce the excitability of cells by increasing @xmath25 , it will be more difficult for wave front to propagate cross the center , and only the half part with stimulation can oscillate . since the global oscillation is induced by mutual coupling , we are going to study the oscillation behavior with respect to the coupling strength . here , we sweep @xmath7 from 0.45 to 2.7 , and summarize the variation in the oscillation period and position of the left border of oscillation region .",
    "if the coupling strength is smaller than 0.48 , there is no oscillation , and 4 cells from the tissue border are excited while cells 516 are silent .",
    "oscillation takes place when the wave back passes the 4@xmath29 cell at @xmath49 .",
    "the border then shifts between 3 and 4 , while in - phase and anti - phase period doubled oscillation occur , roughly between @xmath50 .",
    "finally , the oscillation reaches a maximum region : from cells 3 to 18 , until @xmath7 is too large for oscillation to occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasediagram](a ) shows the expansion of oscillatory region .",
    "variations in the period of oscillation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](b ) .",
    "once the central cells start to collectively oscillate , the period rapidly decreases when the coupling strength increases .",
    "the rate of the period decrease gradually slows .",
    "the period changes little in the region where @xmath7 is large .",
    "this phenomenon occurs because the stationary interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wave-1p](e ) ) greatly contributes to the period of oscillation .",
    "the decrease in the stationary interval significantly shortens the period of oscillation when @xmath7 is small .",
    "however , when @xmath7 is large enough , the wave backs reflect immediately without stopping , and the period is determined mainly by the velocity of propagation . therefore , the presented oscillation is robust at strong coupling condition , and tunable at weak coupling case .",
    "there is a parameter region ( the curve of period is drawn in dashed curve fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](b ) ) in which system undergoes period - doubling bifurcation and the period-1 solution lose its stability .",
    "meanwhile , period two solutions appear around this region .",
    "we show more details in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](c ) . in the figure , we draw two intervals in a period two solution , by measuring the time when @xmath51 positively cross the section : @xmath52 . circles ( @xmath53 ) and crosses ( @xmath54 ) indicate in - phase and anti - phase solutions , respectively .",
    "the in - phase period-2 solution is the result of period - doubing bifurcation , while the anti - phase period-2 solution occurs saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the anti - phase period-2 solution has a wider parameter region than in - phase one , and coexistence with fundamental period-1 solution can be observed in both side of @xmath7 .",
    "there are quite complicated bifurcation phenomena specially around the occurrence of period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "we have even found period-3 solution ( in - phase one around @xmath7=0.802 , and anti - phase one around @xmath55 , respectively ) .",
    "although they are very interesting in the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamical system , we leave them to our future work , because current paper is going to discuss the possibility of global oscillation and its potential applications .",
    "the above phenomena are observed in a spatially discrete system , described by ordinary differential equations .",
    "as briefly introduced in sec  [ sec : intro ] , this discreteness is important in both a mathematical and biological sense . let us discuss this significance in more detail .",
    "the diffusion term @xmath56 in a one - dimensional spatially continuous reaction - diffusion model can be formulated as @xmath57 in its difference version .",
    "this type of conversion is a common approach to solving pde numerically .",
    "the diffusion rate @xmath58 usually does not change much for a specific substance under constant conditions .",
    "thus , if we assume that the coupling is mainly due to the diffusion - like effects of substances , the coupling strength @xmath59 changes in square order with respect to variation of @xmath60 , which biologically corresponds to the distance between cells or the cell size . since the profile of the active factor has a scaling property , it is reasonable to suppose that this gradient works for a field of any size .",

    "the period of oscillation and the phase difference between the two sides increase greatly . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : beforeosc ] ) .    from the above description and fig .",
    "[ fig : nullclinemove ] , we conclude that the boundary cell , here no.4 , which is bistable without coupling , turns to switch between two types of mono - stable dynamics . as introduced in sec .  [",

    "the variation of the offset of the dynamical nullcline of the boundary cell gives rise to rich oscillation phenomena .",
    "we will now explore the conditions for oscillation in an approximate manner by studying the dynamics on the oscillation border , where wave backs ( wb ) stop and wave fronts ( wf ) generate .",
    "based on an investigation of the dynamical nullcline and state variable , we concluded that a wave back will not pass a critical cell , @xmath82 , if the nullclines still intersect at the right branch when cell @xmath83 has dropped to its lower equilibrium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nullclinemove](g , h ) ) .",
    "in contrast , if the intersections disappear , the state of @xmath84 will switch to a lower equilibrium .",
    "then cell @xmath82 is possible to oscillate , if it fires a wave front , in the case that the two nullclines do not cross at the left branch when the state of the inhibitor recovers to its lower limit ( fig .",

    "substitution leads to @xmath91 on the other hand , for cell @xmath82 to generate a wave front , there should be no lower equilibrium when @xmath84 is close to the lower tangency point .",
    "this simply means that @xmath92 , which can be rewritten as @xmath93 two critical conditions are shown in fig .",

    "@xmath94 is the `` distal '' side of the critical cell @xmath82 .",

    "back case , since @xmath95 is close to the higher equilibrium , @xmath96 is nearly zero .",

    "if the coupling strength is between wf and wb , a wave back coming from the center can switch the 4@xmath29 cell off , but the cell can not be switched on to fire a wave front .",
    "this is exactly the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beforeosc ] , in which no oscillation takes place . on the other hand , for cell 4 ,",
    "wf is below wb .",
    "clearly , if the coupling strength allows the wave back to suppress the 4@xmath29 cell , the cell will be excited again and lead to a wave front .",
    "the conditions for these two situations depend on many other factors , such as the initial conditions , propagation velocity , cell excitability , and so on .",
    "the situation is much more complicated than the approximated case we have discussed here .",
    "qualitatively , we can conclude that the intersection of these two condition lines is the origin of self - sustained collective oscillation .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a scenario for self - organized and self - sustained oscillation in multi - cellular biological tissue .",
    "in contrast to the usual framework based on an oscillatory genetic network , the present system does not include any self - oscillating cells .",
    "however , by mutual coupling , we can observe collective oscillation inside a group of cells , i.e. , tissue .",
    "moreover , oscillation can manifests itself in several ways , corresponding to different coupling strengths .",
    "anti - phase and in - phase oscillations at the two boundaries lead to changes in the position of oscillation and the oscillating cell population , respectively .",
    "the birth and death of oscillation resulting from variation in the coupling strength were also discussed .",
    "we also provide a general idea of how the size of the cell and population affects the oscillatory behavior . finally , a detailed investigation of the dynamical movement of the nullcline provided insight into the mechanism of complicated oscillatory phenomena .",
    "although there have been several studies on self - oscillatory phenomena in spatially discrete systems in the context of mathematics and physics , this paper extends these basic ideas to spatio - temporal self - organization in a biological system .",
    "it is of interest to extent our new hypothesis to spatial three dimensional systems , i.e. , a more realistic model of living organism .",
