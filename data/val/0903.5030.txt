    "astrophysical relativistic jets are commonly observed in agns , microquasars and gamma ray bursts",
    ". the lorentz factor of the outflow motion is @xmath2 in agns , @xmath3 for microquasars and @xmath4 for gamma ray bursts .",
    "it is considered likely that a central black hole is related to the formation of such jets due to the large luminosity and short timescale of the jets .",
    "however , the actual mechanism of such collimated outflows has not yet been resolved , although many theories have been proposed .",
    "one possible mechanism that has been suggested relates to magnetic hoop stress .",
    "recently , large - scale mhd simulations of jets have been successfully performed by several authors .",
    "for example , mckinney@xcite numerically studied the hydrodynamical flow emitted from an accretion disk , where the jet formation extends to a distance of ten thousand times the radius of the central black hole . in order for a collimated structure to form",
    ", the magnetic pressure has to be sufficiently large in comparison to the ambient pressure of the surrounding medium .    in this paper",
    ", we explore an alternative possibility .",
    "that is , we investigate a mechanism involving the black hole spin itself .",
    "the strong gravitational field near a black hole also affects the flow of particles(e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the effect of gravity may be important when the emission region is concentrated in the vicinity of the central black hole .",
    "bik et al.@xcite discussed this effect by calculating the geodesics of some particles in kerr space - time .",
    "de felice and carlotto @xcite took into account the slow loss of angular momentum and energy of the particles moving along the geodesics .",
    "they derived a certain condition for such dissipative collimation and discussed its astrophysical relevance @xcite .",
    "semerk@xcite considered the effect of a spinning particle in kerr space - time .",
    "more recently , gariel et al.@xcite discussed the collimation of geodesics by using cylindrical coordinates .",
    "these authors pointed out the possibility of collimated outflow occurring along the rotation axis of a kerr black hole .",
    "the axis is a unique preferable direction of the flow , and some trajectories are in fact concentrated along the axis . despite the fact that the possible collimation mechanisms in kerr space - time have been discussed extensively , it is not clear what fraction of the flow ( the ratio of the flow along the rotation axis to the overall emission ) is collimated .",
    "for example , if particle emissions are selected with orbital parameters suitable for the flow along the axis , then the collimated flow is realized .",
    "it is therefore important to evaluate the degree of the collimation and the results will be useful for the astrophysical application .    the problem is closely related to the emission process itself .",
    "to tackle this problem , we present a model for studying geometrical collimation . in our model , billions of particles",
    "are isotropically emitted from a shell with a constant radius covering a central black hole , and the trajectories are numerically calculated .",
    "we use a test - particle ( dust ) approximation to calculate each trajectory .",
    "the collision of particles is ignored in order to evaluate the geometrical effect in an idealized situation .",
    "the collisional hydrodynamics may work toward local isotropy , and may partially hide the effect .",
    "the angular distribution of the particles at the emission radius is assumed to be uniform , but at infinity some deviation from a uniform distribution is produced by kerr black holes . in this way , we study to what extent a rotating black hole affects the collimation of collisionless particles .",
    "our model is not rigorously realistic , but is instead an idealized mathematical model which is useful in evaluating what fraction of the flow is collimated .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : equation ] , we summarize our models .",
    "the numerical distribution of the trajectories of the particles at infinity is calculated as a function of the polar angle , the particles having been emitted with a uniform distribution from a spherical shell .",
    "it is not easy to define a spherically symmetric surface in non - spherical space - times .",
    "two dimensional spatial surface with a constant radius is approximately regarded as a sphere .",
    "this definition , which is valid for asymptotically large radius , is used in this paper .",
    "the numerical results in boyer - lindquist coordinate are given in section [ sec : geometry ] . in order to consider the physical mechanism ,",
    "the same calculation is performed in weak gravity .",
    "asymptotically cartesian and mass centered to order n ( acmc - n ) coordinate is used and the results are given in section [ sec : weakgravity ] .",
    "as the emission radius becomes smaller , a larger number of particles which are emitted outwardly are absorbed into the central black hole . in this case , the spatial uniformity and the isotropy of the particle distribution on the emission sphere become meaningless . in order to demonstrate the absorption effect ,",

    "in the extreme kerr space - time . the escape fraction is the ratio of the number of particles which have escaped to infinity to the total number of particles emitted from @xmath120 . ]    the number of orbits in which particles are absorbed into the black hole increases as the distance between the emitting surface and the black hole decreases .",

    "for a large emission radius , the escape fraction is almost unity , which indicates that in - falling orbits to the black hole can be ignored .",
    "as the radius @xmath124 decreases , the escape fraction significantly decreases .",
    "figure  [ fig04 ] shows that the distribution of particles escaping to infinity or being absorbed into the black hole is not uniform , showing a slight dependence on the angle @xmath125 .",
    "such dependence indicates that the emission distribution can be regarded as being non - uniform .",
    "this property is important since the non - uniformity at the emission surface naturally leads to the non - uniform outflow at infinity .",
    "the trajectories of particles emitted at an angle @xmath126 do not necessarily have the same angle @xmath127 at infinity , as the correspondence between the polar angles is somewhat different at the time of emission and at the time of observation due to its modification during the propagation of the particles .",

    "the initial velocity is @xmath123 , and the other parameters are the same as those used in the test calculations . regarding emission for @xmath129 , there is an excess of @xmath130 at @xmath131 and a deficit of @xmath132 at @xmath133 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the excess appears near the polar regions , which is opposite to the result obtained for @xmath134 , as considered in section [ sec : geometry ] .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude is much larger than the geometrical effect , which is estimated by extrapolating the empirical formula ( [ empiricaleq ] ) , and is @xmath135 at the largest deviation point @xmath131 .",
    "thus , it is concluded that the number distribution strongly depends on other factors . as shown in figure  [ fig04 ] , the escape fraction for @xmath129 varies with a typical amplitude @xmath136 around the average value .",
    "this effect overwhelms the modifications which occur during the propagation , although the excess at the polar regions is expected to be suppressed to a certain extent if the extrapolation still holds .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig05 ] shows the results obtained for a smaller emission radius @xmath128 .",
    "note that the outer boundary of the ergoregion is given by @xmath137 in the extreme kerr case , where the emission sphere is located within the ergoregion , except for the polar regions .",
    "the excess around the polar regions transforms into a great deficit of @xmath138 , and the deviation from the average also becomes much larger .",
    "the origin of this feature can mainly be explained by the non - uniformity at the emission surface @xmath43 .",
    "a strong gravitational field affects the emission and motion of particles in several ways . for example",
    ", a central black hole plays an important role in forming the surrounding accretion disk , and hence determines the distribution of the particles which are emitted into phase space , i.e. , the distributions of position and velocity .",
    "strong gravitational fields also affect the propagation of particles . in this paper , we have concentrated on the latter in a kerr space - time by calculating the trajectories of particles emitted from a ` spherical ' shell .",
    "our concern is not the orbit of a single particle , but the behavior of an assembly of particles .",
    "that is , the deviation from ` spherical symmetry ' which occurs during the propagation of the particles which are initially uniformly distributed on the emission shell and are emitted in isotropic directions .",
    "we were able to extract the geometrical effect under an ideal situation for the emission at @xmath139 . in this case , the particles are anti - collimated on average , i.e. , they spread in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis in kerr space - time .",
    "this feature can be seen even in weak gravitational field with mass quadrupole moment , which partially accounts for the physical mechanism .",
    "the magnitude depends on the kerr parameter and the emitting radius @xmath140 , and the deviation from uniform distribution amounts to a few percent in the case of @xmath141 . with a further decrease in the radius ,",
    "the geometrical effect increases , but the other effects , such as the absorption of particles in certain orbits , become important , and therefore our definition of collimation / anti - collimation becomes ambiguous for @xmath142 .",
    "this feature of anti - collimation along the rotation axis does not agree with the results of previous works at first sight .",
    "the main difference arises from the emission models used .",
    "bik et al.@xcite derived orbital parameters of which a particle emitted in the radial direction is collimated toward the rotation axis .",
    "the condition satisfies @xmath143 , which corresponds to the @xmath144 motion confined in the range @xmath145 or @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "we checked the condition in our numerical simulation , and found that the fraction of trajectories satisfying it is typically @xmath147% .",
    "the isotropic emission is assumed in our model , so that most trajectories are irrelevant to the collimation condition derived by bik et al.@xcite .",
    "williams@xcite calculated the production and subsequent propagation of @xmath148 @xmath149 pairs in the penrose process within the ergosphere by using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the results show that escaping trajectories are collimated and that helical trajectories exist along the rotation axis . the initial emission within the ergosphere is highly constrained in the penrose process@xcite , since one of the particles in the pair should be in a negative energy state .",
    "the emission model is therefore different from ours .",
    "recently , bini et al.@xcite considered the outflow along the rotation axis , and showed that an initially spherical assembly of particles becomes elongated along the rotation axis during the propagation of the particles . in their model ,",
    "the initial direction of the velocity is fixed along the rotation axis , which is again different from our model .",
    "it is not easy to summarize the effects of a strong gravitational field on the collimation of emitted particles in a kerr space - time while taking into account the results obtained in other works . in our model ,",
    "the effect which occurs during the propagation has been clarified as a result of simplifying the emission model .",
    "we found the unanticipated result , i.e. , no collimation along the spin axis , but rather spread toward equator .",
    "this anti - collimation effect along the rotation axis is mainly explained by mass quadrupole moment of the kerr space - time .",
    "the geometrical modification integrated from the emission point to infinity is @xmath150 , which is not so large .",
    "we conclude that in order for the collimated outflow to form , the emission model should provide a much larger deviation in the emitting direction and in the spatial distribution , where the kerr space - time has a considerable effect .",
