    "among the most massive stars , which tend also to be the hottest and most luminous , the emanating stellar winds can be very strong , with important consequences for both the star s own evolution as well as for the character of the emitting radiation .",
    "there is extensive evidence that hot - star winds are not the smooth , steady outflows idealized in the simple cak theory @xcite but rather have extensive substructure @xcite .",
    "massive o - type and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars commonly show soft x - ray emission @xcite and sometimes also non - thermal radio emission @xcite , both of which are thought to originate from embedded wind shocks . in binary systems ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the winds can be efficiently reconverted into radiation by shocks which form when the stellar winds collide @xcite .",
    "the resultant hard ( @xmath0  kev ) x - ray component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the study of the x - ray emission from colliding binaries represents an indirect way of studying the properties of the stellar wind itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hardness of the emission is related to the shock temperature which in turns depends on the pre - shock velocity of the wind .",
    "the x - ray brightness , on the other hand , is sensitive to the pre - shock density of the wind , and hence on the mass loss rate .",
    "the theory for winds emanating from hot stars is mature enough that it is now finding application in many more complex circumstances .",
    "one example is colliding winds of close , massive star binaries .",
    "in several cases these involve massive o - type and wr members with separations of only a few stellar radii . in these systems",
    ", a wind - wind interface can occur while material is still being accelerated @xcite .",
    "this suggests that observations of very close massive binaries could help understand how massive stars drive winds .",
    "however , most of the x - ray studies in massive binaries have been performed for systems with orbital periods of months to years ( e.g. , wr  140 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the relationship between the x - ray emission and the wind properties in short - period systems has been difficult to determine because of a variety of added complications such as wind absorption and strong radiative interactions .    wr  20a is a close massive binary system well - suited to study how radiatively - driven stellar winds initiate and interact .",
    "this eclipsing binary system is composed of two almost identical stars ( 82 + 83  @xmath2 ; wn6ha+wn6 ha ) in a circular orbital with a period of @xmath3  days @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission has been detected for this system @xcite with a @xmath4 ratio greatly exceeding that observed for single wn stars @xcite .",
    "what is more , the x - ray spectrum shows evidence of a hot component around 1.3 - 2.0  kev , supporting the idea that the x - ray emission arises from the wind - wind interaction region .    an intriguing characteristic of the x - ray lightcurve resulting from wr  20a is the lack of observed",
    "eclipses at both soft and hard x - ray energies , which are , however , evident in the optical lightcurve .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray emission shows an increase in brightness , which is slightly more pronounced at softer energies ( 10 - 20% ) , when the wind - wind interaction region is seen face - on . as a result",
    ", wr  20a appears to be brighter and somewhat softer during the secondary optical eclipse @xcite .",
    "these features are very different from the x - ray lightcurves that have been observed and predicted in other systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a clear x - ray luminosity decrement is seen when the wind - wind interaction region gets occulted by the stars .",
    "one possible explanation for this unique behavior could be the orbital modulation of the absorbing wind column density , although its exact temporal dependence will be determined by the structure of the flow near the complex wind - wind interaction region .    in this paper we present two - dimensional , axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of the wind - wind interaction region in wr  20a and test two possible scenarios : one in which the emanating winds are assumed to have achieved their terminal velocities before interacting and another one in which the winds are still accelerating .",

    "observations in order to help answer key remaining questions about the size and structure of the shocked and unshocked regions .",
    "our accelerating wind model for the close interacting binary wr  20a not only provides an accurate description of current x - ray observations , which cover the orbital phases between 0.3 to 0.6 , but also give detailed predictions of the expected lightcurve over the entire orbital period .",

    "the majority of the soft x - ray emission arises in layers that are deeper within the shocked region than in the _ instant acceleration _ model ( figure  [ fig : prof ] ) .",

    "is then followed by a steady increase in x - ray luminosity as the optical eclipses are taken place ( @xmath72 ) and is more pronounced at medium x - ray energies ( figure [ fig : montage ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that in the _ instant acceleration _",
    "model , because the softer x - ray emission arises from more distant ( and less opaque ) layers within the shocked region ( figure  [ fig : prof ] ) , the medium x - ray band light curve shows a sizable increase in luminosity at @xmath73 when softer photons emitted from the shocked wind region can reach the observer without transversing the cold , more opaque wind . as a consequence of both the decrease in temperature and",
    "increase in absorption within the shock wind region , the global emission becomes softer in the _ velocity profile _ model as can be seen in the comparison of the hardness ratio depicted in figure [ fig : montage ] .",

    "the total observed luminosity in the 1 - 10  kev energy range predicted for this model is @xmath76erg@xmath10s@xmath12 .",
    "this should be compared to @xmath77 erg@xmath10s@xmath12 , the unabsorbed luminosity derived by @xcite , although caution must be taken as this estimate was derived assuming only galactic absorption . ]",
    "in this work , we have presented a simplified formalism for modeling the relative complexity of the stellar wind initiation and interaction in the massive , close binary wr  20a . despite its simplicity",

    "[ fig : xray ] , we compare our _ velocity profile _",
    "model predictions to the _ chandra _ lightcurves of wr 20a obtained by @xcite .",
    "overall , the predicted x - ray lightcurves show no significant flux decrement during secondary optical eclipse but instead appear more luminous and softer as the shock - wind region is observed face on .",
    "notably , such features are only present in models when the emanating wind is assumed to be accelerated ( figure  [ fig : montage ] ) .",
    "this system provides a direct diagnostic of the stellar wind initiation and suggests that more detailed observations of wr  20a could help to constrain answers related to the currently unsolved problem of how wr stars can drive such strong winds @xcite .",
    "as observed in figure  [ fig : xray ] , our models not only explain current _ chandra _ observations but provide detailed predictions over the entire orbital phase . with a more precise estimate of @xmath24 ( the distance to the source ) and a better orbital phase monitoring characterization , the approach presented here may be extended to explore several interesting questions .",
    "in particular , we have considered the idealized case in which the structure of the shocked wind region is not affected by the orbital motion , we have assumed that the wind profile is characterized by @xmath49 @xcite and have neglected the additional pressure provided by the wr - star light , which is expected to lead to a radiative braking of the impacting wr wind . as observations improve , three - dimensional simulations of wr  20a with different velocity profiles will be needed to test two - dimensional results and analyze how projection effects can alter our interpretation of both structures and lightcurves .",
    "while it is important to investigate the behavior of individual objects , we should not lose sight of the common physical processes involved",
    ". there has been detailed hydrodynamical models aimed at understanding the x - ray lightcurves of wr+o stars : @xmath78  carinae @xcite , wr  140 @xcite and wr  22 @xcite , which in some case have separations of only a few o - star radii .",
    "generally the wr wind in these systems is so much stronger that it is expected to overwhelm its companion s outflow .",
    "orbital phase monitoring of such systems suggests that contrary to what a simple hydrodynamic ram balance between the two stars might suggest the wind - wind interface is generally kept away from the o - star surface , possibly due to the additional pressure provided by the o - star light impacting the wr wind @xcite .",
    "it is of course interesting to study these systems as they appear to be rather common , but it would be better to use simpler systems like wr  20a as proving grounds of the relative complexity of wr wind initiation .",
