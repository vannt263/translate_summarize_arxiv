    "the study of supermassive black holes and their cosmological evolution is of great interest for a broad range of astrophysical topics including facets of galaxy formation and general relativity . in the last few decades",
    ", a number of different methods were developed to search for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in external galaxies .",
    "their detection in large numbers would clarify our understanding of the early phases of the evolution of galaxies . in _ active _ galactic nuclei smbhs",
    "are now generally believed to be the prime mover of the non - stellar activity .",
    "x - ray observations in the near future are expected to offer the opportunity of detecting some of the distinctive features of strong field gravity , thereby also providing the ultimate proof for the existence of black holes in agn .    there is now strong evidence for the presence of massive dark objects at the centers of many galaxies .",
    "does this hold for _ all _ galaxies ?",
    "if so , why are some smbhs ` dark ' ?",
    "questions of particular interest in the context of galaxy / agn evolution are : when and how did the first smbhs form and how do they evolve ?",
    "what fraction of galaxies have passed through an active phase , and how many now have non - accreting and hence unseen supermassive black holes at their centers ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1969 , rees 1989 ) ?    several approaches were followed to study these questions .",
    "much effort has concentrated on the determination of central object masses from measurements of the _ dynamics of stars and gas _ in the nuclei of nearby galaxies .",
    "earlier ( ground - based ) evidence for central quiescent dark masses in galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) has been strengthened by recent hst results ( see kormendy & gebhardt 2001 for a review ) .",
    "a quite accurate determination of black hole mass was enabled by the detection of water vapor maser emission from the mildly active galaxy ngc4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "the water masers , whose motion can be precisely mapped with vlbi , are located in a very compact disk in keplerian rotation around the central smbh .",
    "the fortunate geometry of the disk , nearly edge - on , allows to obtain the bh mass with high accuracy : @xmath2 m@xmath3 ( neufeld & maloney 1995 , greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "still closer to the smbh , in _ active _ galaxies with with broad line region ( blr hereafter ) , the technique of blr reverberation mapping ( e.g. , peterson 2001 ) provides a powerful tool to estimate the bh mass via the clouds distance from the center and their velocity field ( e.g. , peterson & wandel 2000 , ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "whereas the dynamics of stars and gas probe rather large distances from the smbh , high - energy _ x - ray emission _ originates from the immediate vicinity of the black hole . in _ active _ galaxies , excellent evidence for the presence of smbhs",
    "is provided by the detection of luminous hard power - law like x - ray emission , rapid variability , and the discovery of evidence for relativistic effects in the iron - k line profile .",
    "x - ray observations currently provide the most powerful way to explore the black hole region of agn .",
    "x - rays at the centers of agn arise in the accretion - disk  corona system ( e.g , mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 , svensson et al .",
    "1994 , collin et al . 2000 , and references therein ) . on larger scales , but still within the central region , x - rays might be emitted by a hot intercloud medium at distances of the broad or narrow - line region ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the x - rays which originate from the accretion - disk region are reprocessed in form of absorption and partial re - emission ( e.g. , george & fabian 1991 , netzer 1993 , krolik & kriss 1995 , collin - souffrin et al . 1996 , komossa & fink 1997b ) as they make their way out of the nucleus .",
    "the reprocessing bears the disadvantage of veiling the _ intrinsic _ x - ray spectral shape , and the spectral disentanglement of many different potentially contributing components is not always easy",
    ". however , reprocessing also offers the unique chance to study the physical conditions and dynamical states of the reprocessing material ( see komossa 2001 for a review ) , like : the outer parts of the accretion disk ; the ionized absorber ; the torus , which plays an important role in agn unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ) ; and the blr and nlr .",
    "detailed modeling of the reprocessor(s ) is also necessary to recover the shape and properties of the _ intrinsic _ x - ray spectrum .",
    "recent progress has been made based on the improved spectral resolution of the new generation of x - ray observatories , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. both missions have imaging detectors and grating spectrometers aboard .",
    "their energy sensitivity bandpass covers @xmath1(0.110 ) kev .",

    "the x - ray countrate varies by a factor @xmath150 ( komossa & bade 1999 , komossa & halpern 2001 , in prep . ) ; variable cold absorption likely plays a major part in explaining the observations .",
    "x - ray outbursts from non - active galaxies provide important information on the presence of smbhs in these galaxies , and the link between active and normal galaxies .",
    "one advantage of this method compared to other approaches to search for central dark masses  like hst - based galaxy rotation curves  is that the x - ray flare emission originates from the _ very vicinity _ of the smbh .",
    "therefore , potentially it provides much tighter constraints on the black hole mass .",
    "flares can also be detected out to larger cosmological distances .",
    "future x - ray surveys , like those planned with the _ lobster _ iss x - ray all - sky monitor ( fraser 2001 ) , _ maxi _ ( yuan et al .",
    "2001 , mihara 2001 ) , and _ rosita _ ( predehl 2001 ) will be valuable in finding more of these outstanding sources .",
    "in addition , a number of flare events are expected to be detected ( yuan et al .",
    "2002 ) in pointings of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ missions .",
    "on the one hand , all - sky surveys will be important in detecting the brightest events , due to their large areal sky coverage .",
    "those surveys with sensitivity at the softest energies will be most efficient .",
    "on the other hand , deeper pointings on limited areas , or ` pencil beam ' surveys will increase the number of ( more distant , on average fainter ) events ( see yuan et al .",
    "2002 for logn - logs estimates of the expected number of flares detectable with _ xmm - newton _ , and sembay & west 1993 for a general discussion ) .",
    "concerning deep surveys in limited fields of view , two effects are important .",
    "firstly , there is a limiting maximal brightness the events can reach in the context of the tidal disruption scenario : the most luminous events are those with black hole masses around 10@xmath27 m@xmath3 , with high accretion rate , and the maximal possible fraction emitted in the x - ray band ( definite upper limit : @xmath28 erg / s ) . secondly , there is a limiting distance out to which flare events are detectable because the flare spectra are very soft , and for increasing redshift more and more of the ( black - body - like ) emission is shifted out of the observable energy band ( fig .",
    "[ xmm - simu ] ) .",
    "in addition , distant galaxies may show a higher intrinsic fraction of cold gas which will heavily absorb at soft x - rays .    after the discovery of new x - ray flare events , _ rapid follow - up _ multi - wavelength observations will be essential . apart from valuable new constraints on the favored outburst scenario which would also allow a refinement of model calculations",
    ", these observations would enable us to address a number of important topics :      as the flare emission travels through the ism of the host galaxy , and the igm , absorption features will be imprinted on the x - ray spectrum .",
    "these can then be used to study the properties of the absorbing material .",
    "if the soft x - ray flare emission has an extension into the euv , which is highly likely , then optical observations will be important in order to detect potential emission lines that were excited by the outburst emission .",
    "firstly , any gaseous material close to the nucleus is expected to show an emission - line response .",
    "the time variability of these lines will allow a reverberation mapping of the circumnuclear gas ; line profiles , and line - ratios will allow to estimate the velocity structure and physical conditions ( density , abundances ) of this gas .",
    "in particular , this would also enable us to search for the presence of a blr in these optically in - active galaxies .",
    "if observed with high spectral and temporal resolution with the next generation of x - ray telescopes , like the _ xeus _ mission sensitive between 0.0530kev , the flare spectra may allow to probe the realm of strong gravity , since the temporal evolution of the stellar debris , and of potential spectral features , will depend on relativistic precession effects around the kerr metric .",
