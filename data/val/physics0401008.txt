    "photonic crystals are a well - studied subject nowadays , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . of fundamental importance",
    "is the prediction @xcite that in three - dimensional photonic crystals that meet a tough combination of requirements , light propagation will be completely inhibited in all directions and a photonic band gap will show up for certain frequencies of light .",
    "it is important for technology that photonic crystals can be created that guide light with low losses , and bend light on a scale of an optical wavelength .",
    "the latter properties do not require a band gap in all three dimensions .",
    "a photonic - band - gap crystal would reflect light for all angles of incidence , when the frequency of the light lies within the gap . however , lower - dimensional photonic crystals such as bragg mirrors can also be omnidirectional mirrors , without having a band gap @xcite .",
    "thus , external light sources can only give an indication that there is a band gap or a proof that there is no gap .",
    "internal light sources such as excited atoms do a better job in probing a band gap , because only a gap would completely inhibit spontaneous emission by internal sources @xcite . for the same reason ,",
    "a photonic - band - gap crystal would be a whole new playground in quantum optics , both when one is interested in spontaneous emission in itself , and in processes which normally are obscured or made less efficient because of spontaneous emission .",
    "not only emission rates would be strongly modified inside a band - gap crystal , but also resonant dipole - dipole interactions , for example , as they are mediated by the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is on spontaneous - emission rates of visible light .    for atomic transition frequencies in the band gap of an infinite three - dimensional photonic crystal ,",
    "emission rates vanish everywhere in the inhomogeneous structure . in practice ,",
    "such a uniform suppression of emission rates has not yet been observed for visible light : evidence of crystals exhibiting a full photonic band gap in the visible has not been reported to date .",
    "even when in the future such crystals will exist , position - dependent emission rates will occur at the edges of the crystals .",
    "in general , spontaneous - emission rates of inhomogeneous dielectrics with a high refractive - index contrast , including photonic crystals , are strongly position and orientation dependent . calculated spontaneous - emission rates in this paper",
    "will prove this point .",
    "also , finite - size effects will show up in our calculations .",
    "the model studied here is a finite photonic crystal consisting of a finite number of parallel and infinitely thin planes .",
    "more about our model will be said later in this introduction .    in many experiments ,",
    "dipole orientations are hard to control .",
    "when averaged over dipole orientations , spontaneous - emission rates are proportional to a quantity called the ` local optical density of states ' ( ldos ) @xcite .",
    "the concept of a local density of states was borrowed from solid - state physics .",
    "the local optical density of states was first named the ` local radiative density of states ' @xcite , which is the same quantity .",
    "interestingly , the calculation of position - dependent spontaneous - emission rates also has a bearing on the interpretation of measurements performed with a near - field scanning optical microscope ( or nsom ) . in these measurements",
    ", a sample is illuminated through the tip of the microscope , and scattered light is recorded . in a simple model ,",
    "the disturbance of the optical field by bringing the tip of the microscope to the sample is assumed to be weak , and the tip is modelled as a dipole with a certain strength and orientation .",
    "then , if the light scattered in all directions would be recorded , the measured signal would be proportional to the local spontaneous - emission rate at the position of the tip in the absence of the tip @xcite .",
    "after the above general considerations , we now turn to the topic how spontaneous - emission rates inside photonic crystals are actually being calculated .",
    "the existence of a band gap in an infinite photonic crystal can be inferred from a band structure calculation , which for a three - dimensional photonic crystals is an art in itself ( see the recent review @xcite ) . quite another and more difficult matter is it to calculate emission rates inside infinite crystals @xcite .",
    "emission rates inside or near _ finite _ photonic crystals are even harder to calculate .",
    "other interesting quantities would be near - field or far - field spectra of internal sources , or dipole - dipole interactions and superradiance effects of atoms embedded in a finite three - dimensional photonic crystal , to name a few complex processes in a complex environment . in such cases ,",
    "results of calculations are hard to check and - even if correct - they might not give much insight .",
    "it is therefore very useful to study complex processes in simplified models for photonic crystals .",
    "widely used is the so - called quasi one - dimensional model ( or isotropic model ) for photonic crystals @xcite , where it is assumed that the red edge of the stop bands of the crystal occur at the same band - edge frequency for all three - dimensional propagation directions , and similarly for the blue band edge .",
    "such a model will describe qualitatively correct the processes well inside the band gap , while overestimating effects of the photonic crystal at the edges of the gap .",
    "the isotropic model also neglects all position and orientation dependence of emission rates outside the band gap .",
    "inspired by the model calculations , more realistic numerical calculations have recently appeared that indeed show the weaknesses of the isotropic model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "another simple model is proposed , one which takes into account the strong spatial and orientational dependence of optical properties and the finite size of the crystals . on the other hand ,",
    "it gives up the existence of a full band gap , as only variations of the refractive index in one dimension are considered .",
    "dielectric slabs are modelled as infinitely thin planes , which will be called _",
    "plane scatterers_. a multiple - scattering formalism is set up in which optical modes and the green function ( a tensor , really ) can be calculated exactly for crystals consisting of an arbitrary number of plane scatterers .",
    "the present model is a generalization of previous work that treated scalar waves only @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of polarization of light will turn out not to be straightforward .",
    "infinitely thin planes were used as model systems in photonics before , for example in @xcite where light propagation was considered in one dimension only and for an infinite crystal .",
    "the model was generalized in @xcite , where infinite photonic crystals were built of infinitely thin planes and their band structure was determined for waves propagating in three dimensions . in @xcite ,",
    "both infinite and finite crystals of planes were considered and their transmission and reflection properties were studied with the use of transfer matrix methods .",
    "the infinite crystal was again considered in @xcite and named the ` dirac - comb superlattice ' .",
    "frequency - dependent emission rates were determined for several positions in the unit cell and both te- @xcite and tm - waves @xcite were considered .",
    "the periodicity of infinite crystals makes that bloch s theorem can be used in the analysis .",
    "finite photonic crystals do not have this advantage and the analysis of the optical properties is usually more difficult .",
    "position - dependent spontaneous - emission rates remain to be explored in model photonic crystals consisting of a finite number of plane scatterers , where light propagation in all three dimensions is taken into account , for both polarization directions .",
    "it has been known for a long time that spontaneous - emission rates of atoms change when positioned at distances on the order of the wavelength of light away from a mirror @xcite .",
    "a recent surprise was the measurement and analysis that even a distant mirror ( @xmath0 away ) can change emission rates when lenses are used and when the atomic positions are controlled with a sub - wavelength precision ( a few nanometers ) @xcite .",
    "more complicated than emission near a mirror is it to calculate emission rates of atoms in or near one - dimensional photonic crystals .",
    "a multi - purpose formalism for calculating optical modes in layered dielectrics @xcite was used in @xcite to calculate emission rates inside finite periodic layered structures , especially inside structures that reflect light incoming from all directions , the so - called ` omnidirectional mirrors ' @xcite .",
    "interestingly , light transmission through finite one - dimensional photonic crystals can be found exactly in terms of the transmission through a unit cell , the number @xmath1 of unit cells , and in terms of the bloch wave vector of the corresponding infinite crystal structure . in @xcite ,",
    "this is shown for a simple unit cell containing two layers , but it was also proven for general unit cells @xcite . this remarkable result was reviewed in @xcite , where its importance is stressed not only in optics but also in acoustics , quantum mechanics , and other branches of physics . in the t - matrix formalism of this paper ( which differs from the usual transfer matrix method for layered dielectrics ) , we find similar analytical results , also involving the bloch wave vector .",
    "such attractive analytical results are not available for more complex dielectrics such as finite two- @xcite or three - dimensional photonic crystals @xcite , so that in those cases the use of efficient numerical techniques is essential .",
    "the advantage of our plane - scatterer model is that modes and green functions ( and therefore emission rates ) can be calculated exactly in a lippmann - schwinger formalism , for every finite crystal size , and that light propagation in all directions is taken into account .",
    "lippmann - schwinger formalisms are more commonly used @xcite , but when the finite volumes of dielectric scatterers are fully taken into account , numerical discretization of the dielectric is required and the model stops being simple @xcite . to be sure",

    "the crystal size does not matter : when the individual planes do not reflect any light in any direction ( @xmath322 ) , or when they reflect all light ( @xmath323 ) , one finds the same emission rates in finite and in infinite crystals , because for @xmath322 we have the free - space case and for @xmath323 all unit cells are optically disconnected . only in intermediate cases ( @xmath324 ) can finite photonic crystals have an appreciable _ and _ unit - cell dependent influence on spontaneous - emission rates .    in the intermediate cases ( we assumed @xmath325 ) ,",
    "the single - plane reflection also depends on the frequency of the light .",

    "[ seratesn10 ] , @xmath326 in ( a ) , the emission rates in inner unit cells already are influenced considerably by the crystal .",

    "now consider a parallel dipole at a fixed position , very close to a plane in an inner unit cell . from fig .",
    "[ seratesn10 ] , one can also appreciate how the guided modes will influence the ( frequency - dependent ) emission rate of a dipole very close to a plane . for frequencies @xmath328 and higher ,",

    "the emission rate of the dipole will increase as well .",
    "when increasing the frequency further , the spike becomes so narrow that the dipole ends up in one of the wings of the spike , until the dipole finds itself completely outside it .",
    "this will cause the emission rates into guided modes to drop at higher frequencies .",
    "the combined effect is a peak in the frequency - dependent emission rates .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the dipole emission rate ( or more precisely , its @xmath63-wave component ) for infinite crystals as a function of frequency shows a pronounced peak for dipole positions @xmath74 near a plane ( see fig .  3 in @xcite ) . we can unambiguously attribute this peak to emission into the guided modes .",
    "we can also understand how an emission peak will depend on @xmath186 and on the distance to the plane .",
    "we have seen that spikes are narrower , with higher amplitudes , for larger @xmath316 and for higher frequencies .",
    "when assuming larger @xmath316 , a dipole at fixed distance will feel a guided - mode enhanced emission rate for lower frequencies . however , the dipole will also at lower frequencies begin to fall outside the range of the spike .",
    "this explains why for fixed dipole position and increased @xmath186 , the emission peak has a larger amplitude and attains its maximum at a lower frequency , precisely as seen in fig .  3 in @xcite .",
    "similar reasoning suggests that for a parallel dipole a bit further away from a plane but still close to it ( while keeping @xmath186 fixed ) , an emission peak will occur at lower frequencies , with lower amplitude .",
    "what can be appreciated best in fig .",
    "[ seratesn10](a ) is that for parallel dipoles the total emission rate converges faster than the radiative and guided - mode partial rates separately .",
    "this can be related to a kind of mode competition between @xmath63-polarized propagating and guided modes that we also found for scalar waves @xcite . on the other hand , for perpendicular dipoles",
    "all emission is into radiative modes , so mode competition is absent there and convergence sets in earlier .    for scalar waves the ten - plane structure could act as an omnidirectional mirror , whereas in sec .",
    "[ propmodesvector ] it was found that it is not an omnidirectional mirror for vector waves . correspondingly , the radiative - mode ldos for scalar waves at @xmath212 dropped down to ( almost ) zero inside the ten - plane omnidirectional mirror , whereas the emission rates in fig .",
    "[ seratesn10](c ) show that the radiative ldos for vector waves stays nonzero inside the crystal . in the inner unit cells , dipoles parallel to the planes",
    "emit predominantly guided light .",
    "the small amount of light that leaves the structure is strongly @xmath120-polarized .",
    "this is the case around @xmath212 only , where @xmath63-polarized light is omnidirectionally reflected .",
    "such strongly polarized emission is not a peculiarity of the plane - scatterer model , because it will also occur for a real bragg mirror whenever light of only one of the two polarization directions is omnidirectionally reflected . in the other plots in fig .",
    "[ seratesn10 ] for higher and lower frequencies , the radiative - mode parts of @xmath300 are the sums of emission rates into both polarization directions .",
    "a theory was set up for the multiple scattering of vector waves by parallel planes , thereby generalizing previous work for scalar waves to the more interesting but also more complicated case of light waves . unlike for scalar waves , the green function had to be regularized .",
    "this was accomplished by introducing a high - momentum cutoff .",
    "an effective scattering theory emerged with a nonzero t - matrix that no longer depends on the cutoff .",
    "the t - matrix and green - function formalism turned out to be very convenient for the calculation of propagating and guided modes , as well as spontaneous - emission rates , of finite photonic crystals of plane scatterers .",
    "a non - absorbing plane scatterer satisfies a separate optical theorem for @xmath63- and @xmath120-polarized light .",
    "the radiative and guided modes of @xmath63-polarized light could be mapped onto modes for scalar waves .",
    "the @xmath63-polarized light has continuous modes , whereas @xmath120-polarized modes have discontinuities at the plane positions .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we have stressed the similarities and differences of optical properties of a plane scatterer or a crystal of plane scatterers as compared to the corresponding dielectric slab structures .",
    "it turns out that @xmath120-polarized waves differ more in the two cases than @xmath63-polarized waves .",
    "firstly , because propagating @xmath120-polarized modes are different in the two cases because the brewster angle is @xmath195 for plane scatterers . secondly , @xmath120-polarized guided modes in finite slab structures have no analogues for plane scatterers .",
    "this was also found in @xcite for the single plane and in @xcite for the infinite crystal .",
    "unlike for scalar waves , equidistant and identical plane scatterers can not be an omnidirectional mirror for all vector waves .",
    "such omnidirectional mirrors consisting of dielectric layers do exist . for layered media , at least three refractive indices are required in order to prevent complete transmission of @xmath120-polarized light in the brewster - angle direction @xcite .",
    "omnidirectional reflection is a property of a dielectric for external light sources . in this paper ,",
    "omnidirectional reflection could be related to the emission properties of atomic light sources from within the finite crystals .",
    "the graphs of emission rates ( fig .",
    "[ seratesn10 ] ) show that the emission by dipoles oriented parallel to the planes is affected much more strongly by the planes than emission by perpendicular dipoles .",
    "this is a characteristic of the plane - scatterer model , because the absence of @xmath120-polarized guided modes is responsible for much of the difference . in the frequency interval where @xmath63-polarized light is omnidirectionally reflected , all light that exits the crystal after a spontaneous - emission process will be @xmath120-polarized , irrespective of the orientation of the emitters . still , the major fraction of the light will be emitted into guided modes and stay inside the crystal .    for low frequencies ,",
    "the single - plane reflectivity is lower , emission rates are less affected by the crystal , and finite - size effects are appreciable also in the inner unit cells of the ten - plane crystal . for higher frequencies ,",
    "planes reflect light better and emission rates are more strongly modified . in the inner unit cells , the emission rates converge faster to the values of the unit cell of an infinite crystal .",
    "if the infinite crystal has larger variations in the emission rates inside a unit cell , then a smaller finite crystal is needed to converge to this result .",
    "we argued that the guided modes will give rise to a peak in the frequency - dependent emission rate of a parallel dipole close to a plane .",
    "we also reasoned that the peak will shrink and shift to lower frequencies when either the effective thickness or the distance to the plane is increased .",
    "indeed , the occurrence of a peak and its dependence on the effective thickness agree with numerical calculations on infinite crystals in @xcite ; some more numerical work is needed to corroborate our prediction of the distance dependence .",
    "what other purposes can plane scatterers serve in the future ?",
    "the finite photonic crystals that can be made with them have one - dimensional periodicity only , yet light propagation in all three dimensions for all polarization directions is properly taken into account",
    ". the number of planes can be chosen at will and further advantages are that all optical modes and the complete green tensor can be determined .",
    "our calculations can be extended to situations where not al planes are identical ; or one could allow light absorption or gain in the planes by giving the effective thickness a complex value ; the number of planes per unit cell could also be increased to more than one .",

    "( [ tnfinalapp ] ) of the appendix to planes chosen at arbitrary positions , each with a different t - matrix @xmath329 , in other words with a different effective thickness .",
    "the model can therefore also be used to study the effects of disorder in the positions or in the optical properties of the planes on the spontaneous - emission rates of embedded atoms .",
    "it would also be interesting to study models of finite photonic crystals built up of non - parallel planes .",
    "this can be done , but numerically the model would become more involved , not so much because the planes have an overlap of measure zero , but rather because the plane representations for nonparallel planes will be different . numerical calculations for nonparallel planes require the discretization of individual planes .    apart from extending it , one can extract other interesting observables from the model .",
    "for example , the knowledge of the complete green function makes it possible to calculate both far - field and near - field spectra of atoms embedded in the finite crystal .",
    "it would be interesting to study spectra near frequencies where the corresponding infinite crystal gives rise to a van hove singularity in the emission rates @xcite .",
    "crystals of plane scatterers can serve as a model environment to study the modification of several quantum optical processes when atoms are embedded in photonic crystals .",

    "<S> the concept of a plane scatterer that was developed earlier for scalar waves is generalized so that polarization of light is included . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a lippmann - schwinger formalism for vector waves , we show that the green function has to be regularized before t - matrices can be defined in a consistent way . after the regularization , optical modes and green functions are determined exactly for finite structures built up of an arbitrary number of parallel planes , at arbitrary positions , and where each plane can have different optical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to the special case of finite crystals consisting of regularly spaced identical planes , where analytical methods can be taken further and only light numerical tasks remain . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is used to calculate position- and orientation - dependent spontaneous - emission rates inside and near the finite photonic crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that emission rates and reflection properties can differ strongly for scalar and for vector waves . </S>",
    "<S> the finite size of the crystal influences the emission rates . for parallel dipoles close to a plane , emission into guided modes gives rise to a peak in the frequency - dependent emission rate . </S>"
