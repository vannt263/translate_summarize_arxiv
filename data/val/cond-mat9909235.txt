    "for the past fifty years or so , our understanding of the stability of lyophobic colloids has been guided by the seminal works of derjaguin and landau,@xcite and vervey and overbeek@xcite ( dlvo ) .",
    "the focus is on pair potentials between colloid particles , which are comprised of van der waals attractions and electrostatic repulsions .",
    "if the electrostatic repulsions are sufficiently large , the suspension is stable . on the other hand",
    "if the electrostatic repulsions are reduced in some way , by screening by added electrolyte for example , a suspension is rendered unstable towards flocculation .",
    "the dlvo theory gives a clear explanation for this ` salting out ' effect , first studied in detail by faraday.@xcite although the dlvo theory is aimed squarely at understanding the kinetic stability of dilute colloidal suspensions , the dlvo pair potentials are often used to rationalise many other properties of colloidal suspensions .",
    "the unquestioning use of the dlvo pair potentials has been challenged over the last decade by experiments on dilute suspensions of highly charged colloids at low ionic strength ( where the pair potential would predict absolute colloidal stability ) .",
    "void structures,@xcite vapour - liquid coexistence@xcite or biphasic regions,@xcite and other anomalies@xcite have been cited as evidence that under these conditions an attractive minimum develops in the pair potential at large distances , not captured by dlvo theory .",
    "several reviews are available.@xcite until recently , the only theoretical explanation of the observed phenomena has been a modification of the dlvo theory advanced by sogami and ise ( si),@xcite although their analysis has been challenged by other workers.@xcite    very recently though , van roij , dijkstra and hansen ( rdh)@xcite and graf and lwen@xcite have pointed out the existence of so - called volume terms in the free energy of a colloidal suspension , which can profoundly influence the stability of such a suspension without affecting the pair potential of mean force between colloid particles .",
    "( the possible importance of volume terms was first noted by grimson and silbert.@xcite ) the key idea is that pair potentials are not the sole arbiters of phase stability , in the presence of these volume terms . using these ideas",
    ", rdh found that there could exist expanded regions of phase instability in the phase diagram , at low volume fractions and ionic strengths , and argued that this may provide an explanation of the anomalous phenomena .",
    "actually , as early as 1938 , langmuir had sounded a note of caution about the pair potential approach .",
    "he advanced three criticisms of `` the use of energy diagrams [ pair potentials ] to analyse the stability of colloids.''@xcite these insights deserve to be quoted verbatim from his paper :     ( a ) no direct account is taken of the thermal agitation which by itself would tend to cause the colloid particles and the ions to be dispersed throughout the liquid giving an osmotic pressure @xmath0 .    ",
    "( b ) the attraction between the charged micelles and the ion atmosphere of opposite sign which extends throughout the intervening liquid is ignored or neglected although it exceeds the repulsive force between micelles .    ``",
    "( c ) the electric charges on the micelles are assumed to be constant , whereas they must be , in general , dependent on the concentration of the micelles.''@xcite    langmuir argues that the electrostatic free energy , or more crucially the electrostatic contribution to the osmotic compressibility , should be _ negative _ , corresponding to an effective _",
    "this is because in an electrically neutral suspension , correlations between unlike charges lower the free energy relative to a state where all charges are distributed at random .",
    "he supports this argument with the physical examples of a salt crystal , and an electrolyte solution .",
    "further , he argues that to explain the stability of charged colloidal suspensions ( given that the van der waals forces are also attractive ) one either requires `` some new kind of _ repulsive _ force'',@xcite or that the charge on the surfaces of the colloid particles decreases sufficiently rapidly with increasing concentration so as to make the suspension stable again .",
    "the latter seems to be langmuir s preferred explanation , hence point ( c ) above .",
    "he spends some time trying to set up a simple theory along these lines using the ideas of debye and hckel@xcite ( dh ) for simple electrolytes , including a macroion contribution to the screening length .",
    "vervey and overbeek raise several criticisms of langmuir s approach , pointing out that the dh linearisation approximation fails severely , and also noting that `` [ the double layer ] thickness is determined by the electrolyte concentration in the sol medium , far from any particle , and is , therefore , independent of the sol concentration ( in dilute sols).''@xcite in other words , the macroions are too far apart to contribute to the screening length .",
    "they conclude that `` langmuir s theory of the attraction force between particles is untenable.''@xcite these criticisms are correct ( and below we shall have to address them in developing a new version of the theory ) but they also appear to have had the adverse effect of driving langmuir s general arguments into obscurity.@xcite in fact , as i shall argue below , langmuir s general points are well made .",
    "the purpose of this paper therefore is to present a relatively simple analysis of the free energy of a charge stabilised colloidal suspension , treated as a highly asymmetric colloidal electrolyte , but avoiding the problems associated langmuir s original application of debye - hckel  theory . in so doing",
    "we will find that the stability of charge stabilised colloidal suspensions can be explained solely by the first _ two _ of langmuir s points .",
    "the principal factors are the translational entropy of the small ions and finite macroion size effects .",
    "a more detailed examination though shows that these stabilising mechanisms can _ fail _ , at low salt , low volume fractions , and high macroion charge .",
    "this is the origin of the phase instability discovered recently by rdh , which in the present model appears as a _ closed - loop miscibility gap_a region in the phase diagram in which phase separation occurs into colloid rich and colloid depleted phases .",
    "the analysis is partly inspired by the recent application of dh theory to the critical behaviour of the so - called ` restricted primitive model ' ( rpm ) of symmetric electrolytes by fisher and co - workers,@xcite and a much earlier analysis of the stability of parallel charged rods by michaeli _",
    "et al_.@xcite the miscibility gap in the present case is the analogue of the vapour - liquid phase transition found at low densities and low temperatures in the rpm .",
    "there are many parallels between the present approach to the colloid problem and the above cited approaches to the rpm : for instance it is known that dh theory captures the phase transition in the rpm provided the essential role  of finite ion size effects is acknowledged,@xcite and that the prediction of the critical density can be inaccurate due to non - linear effects , largely captured in the case of the rpm by the bjerrum pairing model.@xcite these features will recur below",
    ".    the programme will be as follows .",
    "first i specify a ` primitive ' model of a colloidal suspension as a highly asymmetric electrolyte , by analogy to the rpm .",
    "next i analyse the domains of applicability of various approximations , before obtaining a tractable analytic expression for the free energy .",
    "as well as explaining the stability of colloidal suspensions , this free energy also predicts the closed - loop miscibility gaps at low ionic strength and high charge , which are analysed in some detail .",
    "the nature of interface between coexisting phases is also examined , as are arguments for the existence of many - body attractions .    as well as presenting this theory in some detail",
    ", i will also try to relate the ideas to the existing body of work which is quite extensive .",
    "in particular , in appendices , i present comparisons with the sogami - ise  theory,@xcite the recent work by van roij , dijkstra and hansen,@xcite and that by levin , barbosa and tamashiro.@xcite",
    "suppose that the colloid particles or macroions have diameter @xmath1 , positive charge @xmath2 and number density @xmath3 .",
    "the macroion volume fraction is @xmath4 .",
    "there are small coions and counterions at number densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "i suppose there is only one species of counterion and all small ions are univalent , and of a size sufficiently small to be negligible in the analysis which follows.@xcite the solvent is taken to be a dielectric continuum of permittivity @xmath7 .",
    "the coulomb interaction between a pair of univalent charges in units of @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bjerrum length ( @xmath11 in water at room temperature)this is one of the natural length scales for the problem .",
    "the effects of temperature can be subsumed into the weak temperature dependence of @xmath12.@xcite the densities are slaved by the electroneutrality condition @xmath13 , which actually plays a rather important role  as discussed further below .",
    "it will be convenient to write @xmath14 to bring out the fact that it represents the added salt or electrolyte concentration .",
    "much work has been done applying integral equation methods to this model .",
    "the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) can be solved analytically,@xcite and it has been noticed that this predicts a region of phase instability for the salt - free system.@xcite similarly , solutions for the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) approximation have been computed,@xcite and belloni and others also found indications of a phase instability.@xcite various improved approximations have also been studied.@xcite other workers have considered the problem using the random phase approximation ( rpa),@xcite the symmetrised poisson - boltzmann  equation,@xcite an analogue of the fisher - levin approach to the rpm,@xcite various local density approximations,@xcite and most recently field - theoretical methods.@xcite because of the difficulty in extracting solutions though , a full phase diagram does not appear to have been constructed .",
    "in addition , the physics underlying the various approximations is often obscure , and it may not be easy to distinguish numerical artifacts from real effects .    moreover ,",
    "in the integral equation approaches to the primitive model , it may not be sensible to treat the macroion - macroion interactions on the same footing as the macroion - small ion or small ion - small ion interactions because of the gross asymmetry .",
    "this is why it can be desirable to integrate out the small ion degrees of freedom and treat what remains as an effective one - component system with a different approximation scheme .",
    "the effective one component model has traps for the unwary though : we shall see below that three of the most important contributions to the overall free energy are volume terms , and as such easily omitted .",
    "( these are the background electrolyte free energy , the interaction between the small ions and the macroions , and most subtle of all , a background subtraction counterterm that cancels most of the mean field macroion - macroion interaction . )",
    "very recently , direct numerical simulation of one particular realisation of this model has been undertaken by lobaskin and linse,@xcite despite the difficulty in accessing relevent system sizes and time scales .",
    "this work confirms langmuir s insight that the pressure in these systems is reduced by the electrostatic interactions .    to describe the physics of the model",
    ", it will be convenient to draw analogies with the physics of classical plasmas@xcite and liquid metals.@xcite other authors , particularly grimson and co - workers,@xcite have recognised the benefits of these analogies .",
    "my first aim is to establish the domain of applicability of the various linearisation and mean - field approximations underpinning debye - hckeltheory . to this end",
    "i introduce the following two screening lengths : @xmath15 which is the debye screening length from the small ions , and @xmath16 which is the screening length assuming the macroions also contribute .",
    "it seems something of a heresy to introduce @xmath17 but the analysis below will indicate precisely the limits of validity of this concept .",
    "the two screening lengths are given by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the wigner - seitz  cell radius @xmath20 as a measure of the typical distance between macroions , defined by @xmath21 . noting that @xmath22 finds three distinct regions of behavior depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath20 : ( i ) @xmath23 , ( ii ) @xmath24 and ( iii ) @xmath25 .    if there is no added salt , then @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . as the macroion concentration increases therefore , the two screening lengths decrease _ more _ rapidly than the mean distance between macroions .",
    "thus region i is obtained at the lowest macroion concentration , followed by region ii and then region iii .",
    "the crossovers occur at @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively ( restoring factors of @xmath12 ) .",
    "if salt is added , it acts to reduce both screening lengths .",
    "for instance one has a crossover from @xmath31 for @xmath32 to @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and there is a similar crossover for @xmath17 .",
    "this competes with the crossovers discussed in the preceeding paragraph but when the dust settles a fairly simple picture emerges , shown in fig .  [ regfig ] . if @xmath2 the crossovers are well separated .",
    "note that the analysis in the strict absence of salt fails to capture the re - entrant behaviour of region iii .",
    "]    what is the physics behind this classification ? in region",
    "i there are sufficient macroions in a screening volume for a dh mean - field approximation to be correct , since @xmath35 implies @xmath36 .",
    "below we shall see that the dh linearisation approximation is also valid . in region",
    "i therefore , langmuir s picture of dh theory applied to the system _ as a whole _ is valid . in regions",
    "ii and iii though , the spacing between macroions is much greater than the associated screening length ( @xmath37 ) , and in fact both of the approximations underlying langmuir s picture break down .",
    "( thus it is only in region i that @xmath17 has any validity . )",
    "note that this explanation of the ineffectiveness of the macroions in contributing to the screening length in regions ii and iii is not dependent on any time scale separation between the dynamics of the macroions and the small ions ( born - oppenheimer or adiabatic approximation).@xcite indeed , i would argue this dynamic effect should play no role  in determining the equilibrium properties of a colloidal suspension , but i shall return to this point below .    in both regions i and ii",
    ", the macroions are interacting with effectively an _ unscreened _ coulomb law , @xmath38 , since the small ion screening length is still much greater than their mean separation ( @xmath39 ) . in these regions",
    "it is reasonable to treat the macroions as a _ one - component plasma _ ( ocp ) in a neutralising background of electrolyte solution , where the _ polarisation _ of this backround by the macroions is a weak perturbation . on entering region iii though , the screening length from the small ions becomes less than or comparable to the distance between neighbouring macroions , resulting in a strongly screened macroion interaction .",
    "the polarisation of the background electrolyte is no longer weak and the macroions become surrounded with a _",
    "double layer _ of small ions .",
    "here it makes sense to follow verwey and overbeek , and treat the macroions and their accompanying double layers as composite objects .",
    "in particular , verwey and overbeek show that the original coulomb interaction between macroions is replaced by the well known dlvo screened coulomb interaction @xmath40 , possibly with @xmath41 replaced by @xmath42.@xcite    let us return to the linearisation approximation . in regions",
    "i and ii , i have argued above that one can consider the macroions as an ocp .",
    "since the macroion charge is @xmath41 , the corresponding plasma coupling constant is @xmath43 . thus the crossover from weak to strong coupling occurs at @xmath44 or @xmath29 , which is precisely where the crossover between regions i and ii is found .",
    "thus region i corresponds to an ocp in the weak coupling regime where the dh linearisation approximation is valid , whereas region ii corresponds to the strong coupling regime where correlation effects are important .",
    "in fact in region ii one would expect a freezing transition ( colloidal crystals ) at @xmath45.@xcite the crossover from ii to iii occurs at @xmath46 so this transition should be accessible .",
    "the width of the transition is determined by the free energy of the background in a manner discussed recently by stishov.@xcite    the situation is summarised in fig .",
    "[ regfig ] . in regions",
    "i and ii , the macroions are well approximated by an ocp in a neutralising and weakly polarisable background .",
    "( ii ) corresponds to the weak ( strong ) coupling regime . in region",
    "iii , the polarisation of the background becomes severe , and the coulomb law is screened on distances less than the mean spacing between macroions .",
    "let us put some typical numbers into the problem , for example @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the upper apex of region ii corresponds to @xmath49 and @xmath50}\\sim10^{-6}\\,{\\mathrm{m}}$ ] , and the upper apex of region i corresponds to @xmath51 and @xmath50}\\sim10^{-12}\\,{\\mathrm{m}}$ ] .",
    "these results are typical .",
    "we see that region i occurs at physically inaccessible concentrations , and in this sense verwey and overbeek s criticism of langmuir is made very precise .",
    "region ii is accessible at very low salt concentrations , and is where the anomalous behavior is observed .",
    "most colloidal suspensions sit in region iii though , where the dlvo picture is expected to be valid .    in the next section therefore i will develop a closed form expression for the free energy appropriate to regions ii and iii .",
    "debye - hckelapproximations will be used to handle the small ion - small ion and small ion - macroion interactions , but , as the above analysis shows , the macroions may be in a strong coupling regime .",
    "for instance the macroion pair correlation function may develop strong oscillations , which can never be reproduced in a simple dh theory . to handle the macroion - macroion interactions therefore",
    ", i will turn to a variational method first introduced by firey and ashcroft,@xcite and applied to colloidal suspensions by shih and stroud.@xcite     where @xmath52 is a prefactor of order unity . for the purposes of the present work",
    ", @xmath53 is assumed , to correspond with previous work.@xcite .",
    "when fluctuation and correlation effects are taken into account , the situation may correspond more closely to the dashed line ( see fig .  7 in ref .  )",
    ".[grootfig ] ]    before moving on to this , i should discuss the approximation involved in treating the small ion - macroion interaction ( the double layer ) using dh theory . in this case",
    ", the dh approximation amounts to linearising @xmath54 in the space arond the macroion .",
    "this should be valid provided @xmath55 for @xmath56 , or @xmath57 where @xmath52 is a numerical constant of order unity .",
    "if @xmath58 , the effective charge on the macroion ( as gauged by comparing with the dh result at large distances for example ) saturates around @xmath59 by a kind of counterion condensation effect .",
    "this effect gives an indication of the limit of validity of dh theory applied to the problem . using poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory , alexander _ et al _  suggest that the maximum charge is of order @xmath60 suggesting that @xmath61 ( eq . ( i.7 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "simulations by groot though suggest that pb theory overestimates the effective charge , and correlation effects may actually reduce the effective charge for @xmath62.@xcite results resembling pb theory are also obtained in a variational approach by levin _",
    "et al_.@xcite the general phenomenon is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ grootfig ] , where i have compromised on @xmath53 as representative of the literature as a whole .",
    "note that the more conservative criterion , @xmath63 , ignores the fact that most of the double layer lies at a distance of order @xmath15 from the macroion surface ( see below ) ; a point discussed in early work by hartley.@xcite experimentally , the effect is broadly confirmed in a number of studies,@xcite and very recently for one @xmath41 and @xmath64 it has been checked in direct numerical simulations.@xcite      to get a tractable expression for the free energy of the system , i follow the development in landau and lifshitz,@xcite and start with an exact expression for the electrostatic energy in terms of the pair correlation functions @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 as @xmath68 range over @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the volume of the system .",

    "as discussed above , with care we can use dh theory to derive @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the dh approximations are inapplicable for @xmath77 , which can exhibit strong structural features in the regimes of interest .",
    "the macroion contribution will therefore be handled separately by the aforementioned variational method .",
    "i now proceed by analogy with the dh theory for the rpm,@xcite taking into account the analysis of the preceeding section .",
    "we solve for the electrostatic potential around an ion of charge @xmath78 by solving the linearised poisson - boltzmann  equation @xmath79 in the space around the ion , where @xmath80 is from the _ small ions only _",
    "( regions ii and iii ) , and @xmath81 is the electrostatic potential . next the potential of mean force between this ion and another ion of charge @xmath82 is taken to be @xmath83 so that the pair correlation function between the ions is given by @xmath84 , applying the linearisation approximation again .    for the small ions this leads to @xmath85 and @xmath86 where the size of the ions has been neglected .",
    "in the energy integral above this results in @xmath87 which is recognised as the dh internal energy in a simple electrolyte solution.@xcite    for small ions around a large ion , the finite size of the macroion should be taken into account . solving the linearised poisson - boltzmann  equation with the condition that the electric field at the surface matches the surface charge density ( @xmath88 at @xmath89 ) results in an electrostatic potential @xmath90 writing @xmath91 in the above energy integral",
    "gives @xmath92 which is recognised as the energy of a finite sized macroion in dh theory.@xcite note that the integral has been truncated at @xmath89 since the hard core repulsion should not contribute to the internal energy ( it will be accounted for later ) .",

    "the effect can be very significant for multivalent electrolytes,@xcite and in certain circumstances can be sufficiently strong to drive phase separation.@xcite for colloidal systems in the present regime though , this mechanism seems ruled out.@xcite    beyond the pair level , a hint of the existence of many - body attractions is provided by experiments which seem to show an attractive interaction between pairs of charged colloid particles in the presence of wall(s).@xcite theoretically , the situation in these geometries is not clear cut .",
    "non - linearities in poisson - boltzmann  theory@xcite seemed to provide an explanation of these observations until challenged by subsequent work@xcite and density functional theory@xcite which argue for the absence of attractions .",

    "next move the macroions collectively so that we have a void region coexisting with a homogeneous distribution of macroions at an enhanced density and the appropriate ordered crystal or strongly correlated fluid structure .",
    "if the compositions and relative volumes of the two regions are chosen correctly , the final state will correspond to a pair of coexisting state points in the phase diagram .",
    "the free energy must decrease in such a process , therefore there _ must _ be a many - body thermodynamic force tending to accumulate macroions in the manner suggested .",
    "this argument is rather general , and indicates a @xmath213-body attraction appears for @xmath214 or so ( see below for a more refined estimate ) .    ]",
    "the second argument concerns the forces acting on macroions in the vicinity of the interfacial region .",
    "note that this region does resemble the experimental situation mentioned above,@xcite given an excess of counterions in vicinity of the interfacial region that extends some way into bulk of the macroion - poor phase .",
    "thus an attraction between pairs of macroions adjacent to the macroion - rich phase might be expected .",
    "however , in the interfacial region , there ought to be a net attraction between an _ isolated _ macroion and the macroion - rich phase . to see this ,",
    "imagine introducing a tracer macroion into the interfacial region . in equilibrium , the probability distribution , @xmath215 , for",
    "the position of the tracer particle across the interface should be proportional to the macroion number density profile , @xmath216 , otherwise the particle is nt doing its job as a tracer .",
    "now consider @xmath215 as the stationary solution of some smoluchowski equation @xmath217 in which @xmath218 is the local friction coefficient for the tracer particle , and @xmath219 is the force acting on the tracer macroion due to the interfacial profile structure . inserting @xmath220 and requiring stationarity shows that this force is simply @xmath221 .",
    "since the macroion density increases through the interface , this means that there must be _ a net attraction between the tracer particle and the macroion - rich phase_.",
    "what is the origin of this force ?",
    "clearly we can decompose it into a number of effects .",
    "the electric field ( potential gradient @xmath222 ) acts to _ repel _ the tracer macroion from the macroion - rich phase , since the tracer is positively charged .",
    "however there is also a gradient in the ionic strength ( fig .",
    "[ interfig ] ) , leading to a force attracting the tracer _ towards _ the macroion - rich phase , due to the polarisation energy discussed earlier ( fig .",
    "[ potfig ] ) .",
    "in fact , in this case we can show that this is not quite sufficient to overcome the electrostatic repulsion , essentially because the miscibility gap does not appear at these parameter values if only the polarisation term is included in the free energy.@xcite    the final contribution which tips the balance in favour of an attraction towards the macroion - rich phase derives from the macroion - macroion correlations represented by the free energy eq .",
    "( [ fmmeq ] ) in the bulk .",
    "note that the background subtraction counterterm in this corresponds to the fact that there is no net interaction between the tracer and macroions deep in the bulk of the macroion - rich phase .",
    "the only force acting over such large distances , the coloumb force , is exactly cancelled by the net charge of the small ions since the bulk is electrically neutral ( which is another way to see that @xmath41 rather @xmath223 should appear in the background counterterm ) .",
    "the macroion - macroion contribution to the force therefore corresponds to a pure correlation effect : the electrostatic repulsion between the tracer and neighbouring macroions causes them to move away leaving an excess of counterions in the vicinity of the tracer .",
    "it is the attraction of the tracer to this ` correlation hole ' , the centre of which is displaced towards the macroion - rich phase in the interfacial region , that appears to be the final piece in the jigsaw .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ forcefig ] , but clearly the lack of a proper theory for the inhomogeneous state is most keenly felt in formulating this notion more precisely .    in the theory for void formation presented above , or the rdh theory ,",
    "these many - body effects are apparently not present .",
    "in fact a kind of many - body interaction has crept in by sleight - of - hand via the electroneutrality condition .",
    "this condition means that it is impossible to vary the macroion number density in the bulk without a concomitant variation in the small ion densities .",
    "the consequent effect , via changes to @xmath98 for instance , feeds back through otherwise innocuous terms in the free energy to influence the thermodynamic properties of the system in a non - trivial manner .",
    "as the discussion on the interfacial region shows though , the electroneutrality condition corresponds to the appearance of a donnan potential difference between the phases , hence an electrostatic potential gradient and a macroscopic double layer .",
    "therefore the rather innocent - looking electroneutrality condition conceals some rather important physical effects .",
    "in fact , sogami and ise already identified the crucial importance of this condition ",
    "see appendix.@xcite    whilst in an ordinary liquid , many - body interactions are generally insignificant , the same conclusion is not necesarily true in ionic systems .",
    "although pair interactions may be screened , the long range nature of the coulomb law is never far from the surface , and reappears on whatever length scale is necessary as soon as inhomogeneous charge distributions arise .",
    "the co - operative nature of many - body attractions may shed some light on one of the mysteries of the void phenomenon mentioned in passing above , namely the length of time it appears to take for voids to form .",
    "it is easy to estimate times for macroions to diffuse distances of order the interparticle spacing .",
    "these times ( @xmath224 ) are of the order of 10100 seconds or less , even for the largest ( @xmath225 ) particles , whereas the void formation time is measured in 10100 hours.@xcite this certainly appears to present a difficulty for theories based on attractive minima in pair potentials , and arguments which rely on a time scale separation between the small ion and macroion dynamics,@xcite but can be explained rather easily in the present theory .",
    "for example , in the spinodal instability region , one might expect that only density fluctuations of sufficiently long wavelengths @xmath140 to incorporate sufficiently many macroions will be unstable and grow .",
    "the growth rate decreases as @xmath226 , and the difference in the above time scales ( a factor of @xmath227 or so ) can be explained by supposing that the minimum fluctuation size is of order @xmath228 or so particles in linear dimensions . in the above terms , this implies @xmath213-body attractions start to be significant around @xmath229 particles .    at present",
    "though , no immediate explanation seems forthcoming for the elaborate time sequences of phase transformations that have sometimes been observed.@xcite uncharged colloid - polymer mixtures with vapor - liquid and freezing transitions in their phase diagram have recently been demonstrated to have a rich kinetic behaviour.@xcite in the present case where the vapour - liquid phase transition is driven at least in part by many - body attractions , even more varied novel kinetic pathways seem possible .",
    "we have seen how a carefully justified debye - hckel  ( dh ) theory can be constructed for the free energy of a charge stabilised colloidal suspension , treated as a highly asymmetric electrolyte or plasma .",
    "linearisation and mean - field approximations are justified and applied to the interactions of small ions with small ions , and of small ions with macroions .",
    "these approximations can not be supported for the macroion - macroion interactions , which are treated separately by a well - established variational method .",
    "the most remarkable prediction that emerges from the analysis is the appearance of a phase instability in the form of a closed - loop miscibility gap , at low ionic strengths , low volume fractions , and high macroion charges .",
    "this gap appears to be the analogue , for the highly asymmetric electrolyte , of the vapour - liquid coexistence region in the rpm .",
    "the present theory confirms the recent calculations of van roij , dijkstra and hansen ( rdh ) who use a different approximation method.@xcite void formation and other anomalies in highly charged colloidal suspensions at low ionic strengths would appear to have a natural explanation in terms of this phase instability .",
    "the phase instability is driven by the electrostatic correlation free energy , and is principally opposed by the counterion translational entropy acting in concert with the condition of bulk phase electroneutrality .",
    "the precise location and extent of the instability depends on more subtle details , such as finite macroion size correction factors in the various terms in the free energy .",
    "the above analysis has not exhausted the list of possible phases that might form in charge stabilised colloidal suspensions . as well as ordered colloidal phases ( colloidal crystals )",
    "that have been included by rdh there is a rather general argument based on a landau theory that _ charge - density - wave _ phases might be expected in the vicinity of critical points in charged systems,@xcite in other words in the vicinity of the upper and lower critical solution points in the present theory .",
    "this possibility arises because such modulated phases can break the electroneutrality condition that applies in bulk phase separation , and allow the density of small ions to be more uniformly spread than the macroion density . to decide whether such a phase is stable or not requires that the present theory be elaborated to treat such inhomogeneous states though .",
    "the extension to treat inhomogeneous states is also a critical step in constructing a theory for the interfacial region , from which many insights might be gained into the nature of the phase transition and the role of many - body attractions , which are concealed to some extent in the homogeneous theory by the use of the electroneutrality condition .",
    "the theory can be extended in a number of other directions too .",
    "one extension is to improve the dh approximation for the polarisation free energy taking into the saturation effect indicated in fig .",
    "[ grootfig ] , and avoid the charge that the interesting effects in the present theory lie at the margin of its validity ( see appendix c ) .",
    "another extension is to see what happens if the present fixed - charge macroions are replaced with fixed - surface - potential macroions , or replaced with a more physical charge - regulating model for the surface,@xcite thereby addressing langmuir s point ( c ) in the introduction .",
    "one of the most interesting developments is to replace the supporting simple electrolyte by a more complex fluid , such as a polyelectrolyte solution .",
    "let us suppose that the polyelectrolyte chains have an opposite charge from the macroions",
    ". whilst there are effects on all components in the electrostatic free energy , perhaps the single most important effect might be the reduction in importance of the translational entropy of the counterions.@xcite this can be captured by replacing @xmath230 of eq .",
    "( [ fideq ] ) by @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the additional polyelectrolyte segment density , @xmath233 is the degree of polymerisation , and @xmath205 is the charge per segment .",
    "preliminary investigations show that the effect of the polyelectrolyte in this model is to strongly amplify the phase instability , particularly around the charge stoichiometry plane @xmath234 , in accordance with expectations .",
    "this simple picture might lead to new insights into the phase behaviour ( coacervation ) of mixtures of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and colloids@xcite or proteins.@xcite    a final extension might be to re - introduce van der waals attractions between macroions .",
    "this should result in the re - appearance at high salt concentrations of a second phase instability , corresponding to the salting out phenomenon presently captured by the dlvo theory .",
    "indeed such a theory has been constructed by victor and hansen,@xcite and grimson _",
    "et al_,@xcite for related models . in this way",
    ", one might hope for a truly general theory that encompasses _ all _ aspects of the stability of lyophobic colloids .",
    "for useful discussions and correspondence , i thank m. e. cates , r. evans , r. d. groot , j .-",
    "hansen , m. lal , y. levin , k. s. schmitz , r. p. sear , m. v. smalley , i. d. robb , r. van roij .",
    "i particularly thank d. g. hall for initiating me in the mysteries of charged colloidal suspensions , some years ago now , and drawing my attention to langmuir s work .",
    "by making a distinction between the ` helmholtz pair potential ' and the ` gibbs pair potential ' , sogami and ise ( si ) introduce an ingenious twist to the standard dlvo theory . in their theory",
    ", the gibbs pair potential acquires an attractive tail which can overcome the electrostatic repulsions at large distances .",
    "sogami and ise argue that this is the explanation for the void structures and other anomalies seen in colloidal suspensions at low ionic strengths .    of course",
    ", the actual forces must be independent of the thermodynamic ensemble used:@xcite the force experienced by @xmath235th macroion at position @xmath236 is @xmath237 .",
    "it is easy to dismiss the si theory therefore , on the grounds that an elementary mistake has been made .",
    "however , if it is claimed that the si potential is only an `` effective pair potential,''@xcite then what the si theory actually does is to capture the state point dependence of the debye screening length .",
    "this is most clearly illustrated in the derivation by schmitz.@xcite in fact , this model ( charged particles with pairwise screened coloumb interactions and a state point dependent screening length ) _ has _ been shown to have vapour - liquid coexistence , in direct simulations by dijkstra and van roij,@xcite thus vindicating the si attraction mechanism .",
    "such a model omits the volume terms described in the main text though , and i would argue only captures a small part of the physics of the real situation . nevertheless , one should credit sogami and ise with identifying the essential electrostatic origin of the effective attraction mechanism .",
    "for instance : `` the attraction in question is a logical consequence of the principle of electric neutrality.''@xcite",
    "more recently , van roij , dijkstra and hansen ( rdh ) have studied charge stabilised colloids by density functional theory.@xcite by making what is essentially a _ random phase approximation _ ( rpa ) in the inhomogeneous density functional , they are able to solve the problem analytically at least as far as computing a closed form expression for the free energy .",
    "the resulting free energy is basically the same as the present dh free energy , in the sense that for each important term in eq .",
    "( [ ftoteq ] ) , there is a corresponding term in the rdh theory with more or less the same functional dependence .",
    "they report phase diagrams for only a few parameters , which are compared with the present theory in table  [ tab : vrh ] .",
    "( it should be noted that the longer paper@xcite corrects the initially reported calculations.@xcite ) the predictions from both theories for the critical salt concentration are in good agreement , but the critical volume fractions are as much as an order of magnitude higher in rdh at the high @xmath41 end . at the highest @xmath41 ,",
    "rdh do not appear to find even metastable fluid - fluid coexistence .",
    "the trends are not the same either : in the present theory the critical @xmath156 increases with increasing @xmath41 , whereas the reverse holds for rdh .",
    "similarly , the present theory always predicts a lower critical salt concentration , albeit at very low salt concentrations .",
    "it is not clear if this also holds for rdh .",
    "these differences in detail though should not mask the overall similarity between the predictions of the two theories .",
    ".upper critical solution points for van roij , dijkstra and hansen macroion parameters.@xcite[tab : vrh ] [ cols=\">,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the theory , the differences lie in three places .",
    "firstly , in the macroion - small ion interaction term , rdh end up with an expression very similar to the present one in eq .",
    "( [ fsmseq ] ) , but with a somewhat different finite size scaling factor : @xmath238 ( note that @xmath239 as @xmath105 ) . which is closer to the true free energy depends on whose approximations are most believable ; for example one can compare the difference to the two approximations introduced for the msa by groh _",
    "et al_.@xcite secondly there are minor differences in macroion - small ion hard core interaction term  their expression can be derived from the present theory by setting @xmath240 and making a similar adjustment in the prefactor .",
    "thirdly , the small ion interaction term is absent from rdh although it makes no practical difference to the results .",
    "this term can be recovered if one actually carries out the functional integration over the small ion density fluctuations.@xcite    a point of fundamental interest remains though . in their longer paper,@xcite rdh claim that the long wavelength macroion - macroion structure factor , @xmath241 , should _ not _ diverge at the critical point because the pair interactions between macroions remain purely repulsive , although in a later article they modify this position somewhat.@xcite the counter - argument is that the spinodal line ( including the critical point ) is the locus of points where the determinant of second partial derivatives of the free energy vanishes . since the long wavelength structure factor _ matrix _ is the inverse of the matrix of second partial derivatives of the free energy , one would expect _ every _ component of the structure factor matrix including @xmath241 to diverge on the spinodal line , barring accidental cancellations .    what , then , is missing from the pair potential argument ?",
    "firstly , we have seen that many - body effects are undoubtably present , although concealed in the present theoretical approaches by the apparent simplicity of the electroneutrality constraint .",
    "secondly , the use of the rpa itself can be misleading .",
    "frequently , the rpa is used to derive an @xmath242 which is at a _ lower _ level of approximation ( zeroth order in a loop expansion to be precise ) than the free energy ( first order in a loop expansion ) .",
    "if the phase instability only appears at the higher level of approximation , as is the case for dh theory for example , then it will not be seen in @xmath242 .",
    "this does not uncover any profound physics though , rather it represents an inconsistent level of approximation between @xmath242 and the free energy . to get consistent results",
    ", one should either compute @xmath242 to first order in a formal loop expansion ( which may be a hard calculation ) , or invert the matrix of second partial derivatives of the free energy ( which only gives @xmath243 ) .",
    "i have also emphasised these considerations in relation to polyelectrolytes : see appendix to.@xcite",
    "in a series of papers , levin , barbosa and tamashiro ( lbt ) introduce a theory for charge stabilised colloidal suspensions which is very close to the present studies.@xcite the theory is studied in the absence of added salt though , and unfortunately this may have led the authors to miss the existence of the miscibility gap which only appears at a finite added salt concentration ( according to the present theory , at least ) . a novel feature of the lbt approach is an attempt to account for the counterion condensation phenomenon . their results for the effective charge resemble the pb theory of alexander _",
    "et al_.@xcite and groot.@xcite thus fig .  1 in ref",
    ".   shows counterion condensation starting effectively for @xmath244 ( their reported calculation is for @xmath245 and @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is their reduced temperature ) .",
    "the lbt approach is motivated by analogy to the work on the rpa by fisher and levin .",
    "the free energy is split into contributions similar to those identified here , and the incorporation of the counterion condensation is motivated by the importance of bjerrum pairing in the rpm . the counterion contribution to the free energy",
    "is that of an ocp , which reduces to the first of eqs .",
    "( [ fsmseq ] ) here in the relevant limit where the ion concentration is @xmath248 .",
    "the macroion - counterion contribution is identical to that in rdh , except that the self energy of the macroion , @xmath249 , is also included .",
    "this is essential for the lbt theory where the effective charge @xmath41 is variable , whereas in theories where @xmath41 is fixed the self energy just shifts the macroion chemical potential .",
    "the macroion contribution is treated via a mean field - van der waals approximation omitting the background subtraction counterterm .",
    "as described in the main text , this omission can have quite a significant effect on the location of the miscibility gap , and it would be quite important to rectify this in any future work .",
    "it seems that progress might be made by combining the variational approach to the counterion condensation phenomenon advocated by lbt , with the more careful treatment of the free energy of the whole system considered in the present paper ( or by rdh ) .",
    "it certainly would be interesting to see whether the miscibility gap appears when added salt is included in such a theory , which can legimately be pushed to much higher values of the bare macroion charge than have been considered in the present study ."
