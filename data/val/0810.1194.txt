    "the photoproduction of a pseudo scalar meson such as the kaon can be described by four complex amplitudes which result in sixteen real observables @xcite .",
    "measurement of at least eight well chosen observables gives a `` complete measurement '' which is sufficient to fully constrain these photoproduction amplitudes .",
    "currently this is an important goal of the leading photon beam facilities and measurements with combinations of polarised beam , polarised targets and @xmath1 recoil polarisation are being carried out , with the main physics motivation to better establish the nucleon excitation spectrum . as well as",
    "resonance information , accurate data in the threshold region is needed to challenge recent theoretical models based on effective field theories .",
    "there is presently no detailed measurement of the @xmath2 in the threshold region . at higher energies new quality data",
    "is available from jlab @xcite and elsa@xcite .",
    "however , significant discrepancies exist between the cross sections from the two previous measurements for photon energy ranges accessible at mami @xcite .",
    "the jlab measurement also extracted the total polarisation transferred to the @xmath1 after photoproduction with a circular polarised photon beam .",
    "this observable was close to one for all measured kinematics and for photon beam energies 1.032 to 2.741  gev which has led to speculation about the reaction mechanism @xcite .",
    "we present preliminary spectra from the @xmath2 reaction with a circular polarised tagged photon beam in the energy range 0.9 - 1.4  gev using the crystal ball at mami - c .",
    "the mainz microtron ( mami - c ) is an electron accelerator facility in mainz , germany , capable of accelerating electrons up to 1.5  gev .",
    "the electrons produce circularly or linearly polarised photons via bremsstrahlung in a solid radiator .",
    "the photon energy is tagged by momentum analysis of the recoiling bremsstrahlung electrons in the glasgow tagger @xcite .",
    "the crystal ball @xcite is a calorimeter with 672 optically isolated nai crystals .",
    "the output of the photomultiplier for each crystal is digitised using multi - hit tdc and adc modules .",
    "surrounding the liquid hydrogen target at the centre of the crystal ball is the particle identification detector ( pid ) .",
    "the pid comprises 24 plastic scintillator detectors parallel to the beam and read out by photomultipliers at the upstream end .",
    "@xmath3 analysis provides a means of proton , charged pion and electron identification .",
    "the crystal ball is an excellent neutral meson detector via the detection of the decay photons .",
    "taps @xcite is a 350 element baf@xmath4 spectrometer which covers the forward angle range . the crystal ball and taps",
    "cover approximately 93% of 4@xmath5 steradian .",
    "the combined setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbpic ] .",
    "it is not possible to identify @xmath0 using the pid detector alone as the particles have mass and charge too similar to the proton to be effectively separated using @xmath3 techniques and the subsequent weak decay of the particles in the detectors spoils the unique energy signal . in previous measurements",
    "large magnetic fields and tracking detectors were employed to circumvent this problem . for the case of the crystal ball",
    "this was impractical due to the geometrical constraints of the detector .",
    "a new technique was therefore developed by our group to realise these important strangeness measurements .",
    "the basic principle of the technique is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbpic ] .",
    "the @xmath0 meson enters the crystal ball where it is stopped .",
    "the crystals involved in this initial interaction are identified as those having a timing within 3  ns of the reaction time .",
    "the meson subsequently can decay weakly via : @xmath6 or @xmath7 processes with branching ratios 64% and 36% respectively and a half life of 12  ns .",
    "the characteristic energy deposition arising from these processes can clearly be identified in the energy spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strangemedley](a ) ) .",
    "the timing of the delayed weak decay can be resolved using the 2  ns timing resolution of the crystal ball detector elements .",
    "in fact the half life of the kaon can be extracted from observing the count rate as a function of time .",
    "the result compares favourably with the accepted value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strangemedley](b ) ) .",
    "the crystals in the secondary cluster are identified with a timing gate of between 10 - 50  ns later than the kaon entry time .",
    "a geant4 simulation is used to optimise upper and lower limits on parameters such as the number of crystals in the cluster from the stopped @xmath0 and the @xmath0 decay , the distance to the furthest crystal and the total energy deposition . a subsequent @xmath8 analysis using the pid",
    "provides a final constraint to suppress background from charged particles .",
    "[ fig : strangemedley](c ) shows the reconstructed missing mass of the system recoiling from the @xmath0 which has clear peaks at the masses of the @xmath1 and @xmath9 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : strangemedley](d ) is the energy of the photon beam for events in which a @xmath0 decay cluster occurred .",
    "the number of events below the threshold for strangeness production at 911  mev averages very close to zero . the geant4 simulations of the detection process indicate the efficiency for the @xmath0 decay cluster method is approximately 8% .",
    "the @xmath1 decays to either @xmath10 or @xmath11 with branching ratios approximately 64  % and 36  % respectively .",
    "these are weak decays and parity violating . as a result",
    ", the @xmath1 polarisation can be measured via the distribution of its decay particles .",
    "[ fig : asymm ] is the constructed beam helicity asymmetry , @xmath12 , as a function of the polar angle of the decay neutron from the @xmath1 .",
    "the plot shows clearly the expected modulation .",
    "these spectra will be analysed to extract the polarisation transfer observables cx and cz .",
    "we have developed a new techique for tagging strangeness which enables new accurate measurements of strangeness photoproduction using the crystal ball at mami - c .",
    "further production data will be obtained in the future to improve the statistical precision of the data set",
    ". the mami measurement will provide accurate data in the threshold region and the new measurements at higher egamma will help to resolve present discrepancies between the world data .",
