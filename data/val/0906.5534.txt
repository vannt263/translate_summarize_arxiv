    "recently bilayer graphene ( blg ) has been shown to possess a band gap in the presence of an external electric field,@xcite an effect that has important implications for transport across the graphene layers and for possible device applications .",
    "while the freestanding blg is a zero band gap semiconductor@xcite like the single layer graphene ( slg ) , an applied electric field through an external gate induces an asymmetric potential between the graphene layers , which in turn opens a gap between the valence and the conduction bands in the bernal structure.@xcite it has been recently noted@xcite that graphene exhibits the hexagonal stacking surprisingly often , surprising because of the higher energy of the hexagonal structure . in the hexagonal structure , the two graphene layers are stacked vertically on top of one another , while in the bernal strcuture , one layer is rotated with respect to the other as indicated in fig .",

    ", width=340 ]    to tune the field - induced band gap of the blgs for practical applications in nano - electronic devices , it is important to examine the factors having strong influence on its electronic structure .",
    "electronic structure of blg was shown to be sensitive to the interlayer spacing due to coupling between the graphene layers@xcite .",
    "hence , a uniaxial strain , which changes the interlayer spacing , could modulate the field induced band gap@xcite .",
    "the other factor that controls the gap is the screening of the electric field .",
    "an applied electric field causes unequal charge distribution among the graphene layers which in turn creates a polarized electric field in the opposite direction,@xcite thereby reducing the effective electric field . a detail investigation through density - functional calculations",
    "is required to understand the effect of the electric field and strain on the electronic structure .",
    "while the electronic structure of the bernal blg has been theoretically examined , such studies have not been performed for the hexagonal structure to our knowledge . in this paper , we report results from density - functional calculations and tight - binding models to examine the modification of electronic structure of both bernal and hexagonal stacked blg by electric field and strain . in the bernal structure ,",
    "the screening of the external electric field substantially reduces the band gap as shown earlier , while in the hexagonal structure the screening is not as strong , as explained from a simple tight - binding model . in the bernal structure , where a gap can be opened up by the electric field , strain can be used in addition to modify its magnitude .",
    "we find that the gap can be increased considerably by reducing the interlayer spacing from its equilibrium value by a small amount . in the hexagonal structure ,",
    "the gap can not be opened up ; however , an interesting point for this structure is that the topology of the bands leads to dirac circles centered about the k point in the brillouin zone with linear dispersion due to interpentration of dirac cones .",
    "though the electric field does not produce a gap , it increases the size of the dirac circles leading to a novel way of controlling the fermi surface .",
    "density functional calculations presented in this paper were performed using the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite and linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method @xcite using the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "while the lapw method was used to obtained the total energies and the optimized structures , the electronic structure was investigated using the lmto method , which did not produce any substantial difference as far as the band structure is concerned . to study the field modulated band structure of the blg",
    ", an extra potential @xmath0 was added in the lmto method to the on - site energies of the carbon s and p orbitals of one individual layer .",
    "we used the periodic boundary condition normal to the blg planes , keeping about 10 of vacuum between the different blg layers and , furthermore , in the lmto method , we included layers of empty spheres at positions compatible with the symmetry of the particular blg structure .",
    "the symmetry compatibility was especially important for studying the screening effects at low electric fields .",
    "before we present the results for the blg , in this section , we present the tight - binding fitting parameters for the monolayer graphene obtained by fitting with the lapw bands .",
    "these parameters will be used in a tight banding description of the blg .    for the freestanding monolayer graphene",
    ", it is known that the formation of the dirac cones at the fermi surface is the outcome of the p@xmath1-p@xmath1 @xmath2 hopping between the two inequivalent carbon atoms a and b in the unit cell .",
    "though a simple tight - binding model involving the p@xmath1-p@xmath1 interaction within the nearest neighbor ( nn ) coordination explains the linear band dispersion at the dirac points k and k@xmath3 , it is essential to include further neighbor hoppings if an accurate description of the band structure in the entire brillouin zone is desired .",
