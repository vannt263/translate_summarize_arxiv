    "in the past few decades , the boom in x - ray / gamma - ray astronomy has led to the discoveries of at least two new classes of isolated neutron star : magnetars and dim thermal isolated neutron stars ( dtins ) .",
    "these new classes exhibit distinctive properties different from those of conventional rotation - powered pulsars , the only kind of isolated neutron star known before .",
    "magnetars , including anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , are slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "they often emit luminously in the x - ray band and sometimes show dramatic outbursts and variability .",
    "their x - ray emission and bursting activity are believed to be powered by enormous internal magnetic fields ( @xmath2@xmath3  g ; for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the dtins are nearby x - ray pulsars , having quasi - thermal spectra and no radio emission .",
    "they also appear to be slow rotators and are highly magnetized ( @xmath4  g ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nature and origin of these dtins are still mysteries .",
    "a third possible new class is the so - called `` central compact object '' ( ccos , @xcite ) , apparently isolated neutron stars located in supernova remnants .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether these are a truly distinct class as some ccos have been recently revealed to be conventional rotation - powered pulsars ( albeit with surprisingly low b fields ; e.g. the cco 1e1207.4@xmath55209 , @xcite ) .    what drives the different behaviors of these neutron stars ?",
    "for magnetars , the answer is almost certainly their enormous magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , the dtins also appear to have higher magnetic fields than those of ordinary pulsars .",
    "hence , it is sensible to suspect that magnetic field could be the primary defining characteristic of the three categories of isolated neutron stars .",
    "based on the study of a large sample of isolated neutron stars , which includes most magnetars , some dtins , and many ordinary radio pulsars , @xcite reported an intriguing correlation between the pulsar s blackbody temperature @xmath6 , determined from the x - ray spectrum , and the magnetic field @xmath7 , inferred from the spin - down ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "they also suggested that this correlation could be explained if the crusts of neutron stars were heated by magnetic - field decay , since it would significantly delay the cooling , particularly if the field were stronger than @xmath9  g. a similar correlation was also expected if the core of the neutron star is heated by magnetic field decay , with heat transfer out to the surface , leading to an increase of the surface temperature @xcite .",
    "@xcite expanded the work of @xcite through 2d cooling simulations that included anisotropic thermal conductivity and all relevant neutrino emission processes for realistic neutron stars , in an attempt to unite magnetar and dtins in a simple picture of heating by magnetic field .",
    "their study shows that the dtins could be explained if they are old neutron stars ( @xmath10 yr ) born with @xmath2@xmath3 g magnetic fields , or if they are middle - aged neutron stars born with @xmath9@xmath2 g magnetic fields .",
    "this theory predicts that pulsars with magnetic field higher than @xmath9  g should be hotter than is predicted by a simple cooling model with lower magnetic field , regardless of whether they are radio - quiet or not .",
    "therefore , observing high magnetic field radio pulsars at x - ray energies and measuring the temperature of their thermal radiation may help us unify the different classes of isolated neutron stars .",
    "psr  b1916@xmath1114  is a radio pulsar having period @xmath121.181  s , with spin - down - inferred magnetic field @xmath13  g@xmath14  g , spin - down age @xmath15  yr , and @xmath16erg s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it is a relatively young pulsar .",
    "given its age , psr  b1916@xmath1114  should still be hot enough to be x - ray detectable , according to a minimal pulsar cooling model , without magnetic - field - decay heating @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the highest - magnetic - field radio pulsars known and may therefore be hotter because of magnetic - field decay .",
    "this makes psr  b1916@xmath1114  a good test subject for neutron star cooling models , and hence x - ray observations .",
    "psr  b1916@xmath1114  was observed by the _ newton x - ray multi - mirror mission _ ( _ xmm _ ) observatory @xcite on 2008 march 25 .",
    "both the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn @xcite camera and the epic mos cameras @xcite were operating in full window mode with the thin filter , and with a pointing offset of 1@xmath18.107 .",
    "we analyzed the data taken in this _",
    "xmm_observation , and found that psr  b1916@xmath1114  was clearly detected in both the pn and mos data .",
    "the _ xmm_data were analyzed with the _ xmm_science analysis system ( sas ) version 8.0.0 and the latest calibrations ( updated 2008 oct 3 ) . to exclude strong background flares",
    "that sometimes contaminate _",
    "xmm_data , we extracted light curves of photons above 10 kev from the entire field - of - view of the pn and mos images , and excluded the time intervals in which background flares occurred for all subsequent analyses .",
    "the total exposure time of the observation is @xmath0 25 ks .",
    "however , after excluding the bad time intervals within which the background flux was very high ( @xmath1910 counts per second ) and showing significant burst - like features , only 12 ks of pn , 11 ks of mos1 and 13 ks of mos2 data were used in our analysis .",
    "the data were also corrected to the barycenter using the sas barycen tool after background flares were excluded , using the nominal pulsar position ( j2000 ) ra 19:18:23.638(7 ) dec + 14:45:06.00(15 ) ( @xcite ) .    in order to find the x - ray counterpart of psr  b1916@xmath1114 , we used the sas tool edetect_chain to perform a blind search for point sources .",
    "edetect_chain is designed to find point sources using a sliding cell technique and to calculate the significance of any detection using a maximum likelihood method .",
    "it generates an output source list file containing information like total counts , position and significance of detected sources . in the pn image ,",
    "a point source was detected coincident with the position of psr  b1916@xmath1114  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) by edetect_chain .",
    "the source has @xmath20 range . ]",
    "counts in 0.110 kev band and a likelihood ratio of @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the probability for a random poissonian fluctuation to have caused the observed source counts ) .",
    "this source was also detected in the mos 1 image with @xmath23 counts and @xmath24 , and in the mos 2 images with @xmath25 counts and @xmath26 , both in the 0.110 kev range .",
    "thus , this point source was clearly detected in the pn and the mos data .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] is the pn image , smoothed with a gaussian profile of radius @xmath27 . the small circle in the center of the image marks the radio position of psr  b1916@xmath1114 .",
    "the position uncertainty is smaller than the size of the circle @xcite .",
    "the best - fit position of the detected source given by edetect_chain is ( j2000 ) ra 19:18:23.74(5 ) dec + 14:45:06.2(8 ) , consistent with the radio position of psr  b1916@xmath1114 .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that the source we detected is the x - ray counterpart of psr  b1916@xmath1114 .    the radially averaged profile of _ xmm _ s point spread function can be approximated by an analytic function  the king function @xmath28^{-\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the number density of counts at radius @xmath30 , @xmath31 is a normalization parameter , @xmath30 is the radial distance between the events and the center of the source , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are parameters reflecting the size and shape of the point spread function ( psf ) and are functions of energy and off - axis angle . in order to search for evidence of extended emission from psr  b1916@xmath1114 , we extracted 0.2 - 12 kev photon events from a circular region of 35@xmath34 radius around the best - fit position , and calculated the radial distance between every photon event and the pulsar , to get the radially averaged profile . using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test",
    ", we then compared the observed radially averaged profile to a model composed of a king function .",
    "given the small off - axis angle , and the energy distribution of the source , we chose @xmath35 and @xmath36 pixels@xmath37 and a uniform background ( 0.05 photons / acrsec@xmath38 , inferred from the 397 photons found in a circular background region of 50@xmath34 radius and @xmath03@xmath18 away from psr  b1916@xmath1114 ) .",
    "the k - s test shows that the radially averaged profile can be well matched by the specified king function .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence for extended emission near psr  b1916@xmath1114 from this observation .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum of psr  b1916@xmath1114  from the pn data using a circular region of 32@xmath34.5 radius encircling the source .",
    "the source region should contain more than 80% of the counts from a point source .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from a circular region of 50@xmath34 radius and @xmath03@xmath18 away from the pulsar where no source was detected .",
    "both single- and double- events were selected , but events that hit or were close to a bad pixel or ccd gap were excluded using the filter expression @xmath39 . a response file and an auxiliary response file were generated using the sas command rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "the spectrum was grouped to have a minimum of 15 photons per bin using the ftool grppha , and was then fed to xspec 12.3.0 for spectral fitting .",
    "we also extracted spectra from the data of the two mos detectors using source circular regions of 36@xmath34 radius and background regions of @xmath40 radius .",
    "single- to quadruple- photon events were selected except those that landed on a bad pixel or ccd gap , using the filter expression of @xmath41 .",
    "we then combined the two mos spectra into a single mos spectrum and averaged their background , response and auxiliary files using the ftool addspec .",
    "the resulting mos spectrum was also grouped to have a minimum of 15 photons per bin and was fitted jointly with the pn spectrum .",
    "the x - ray spectra of psr  b1916@xmath1114  can be well fit with an absorbed blackbody model .",
    "however , due to the small number of counts , the column density @xmath42 was poorly constrained .",
    "the best - fit @xmath42 is @xmath43  @xmath44 , too small given the estimated distance and location of the pulsar .",
    "therefore , we estimated the @xmath42 for this pulsar based on the total @xmath42 ( 1.58@xmath45  @xmath44 ) of the galaxy along the line - of - sight and the distance to the pulsar ( @xmath46  kpc , estimated from the 27.2  pc  @xmath47 dispersion measure of the pulsar ; @xcite ) , and find a moderate value of @xmath48  @xmath44 .",
    "fixing @xmath42 to this value , the best - fit blackbody temperature for the 0.12 kev spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) is @xmath49 kev ( table [ tabspecfit ] ) .",
    "the model - predicted absorbed flux in the 0.12 kev range is 1.4@xmath5010@xmath51  ergs  s@xmath17  @xmath44 . assuming a distance of 2.1 kpc , we find the bolometric x - ray luminosity of psr  b1916@xmath1114   to be @xmath52  ergs s@xmath17 .    by fixing @xmath42 while fitting the pn and mos spectra , we underestimate the uncertainties of the best - fit parameters . in order to get a sense of the real uncertainty of @xmath53",
    ", we tried fitting with a range of @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath42 likely lies between @xmath54  @xmath44 and @xmath55  @xmath44 .",
    "it is probably not smaller than @xmath54  @xmath44 because the distance estimated from the dispersion measure is unlikely to be incorrect by more than 50% .",
    "also , an absorbed blackbody model with @xmath42 higher than @xmath55  @xmath44 can not fit the spectra well for any @xmath53 . with @xmath42 restricted to lie between these two values , the acceptable ( null hypothesis possibility of the fit @xmath19 0.01 ) range of @xmath53 is 0.08 to 0.23 kev ( with blackbody radius range from @xmath06 km to @xmath00.2 km ) .",
    "this temperature range reflects reasonable uncertainties on @xmath42 , and is quoted in the abstract and figures [ fig : agekt ] and [ fig : bkt ] ( see below ) .",
    "the pn and mos spectra could also be fit with a power - law model , with a best - fit @xmath42 of @xmath56 @xmath57 and a photon index of @xmath583.5@xmath59 ( table [ tabspecfit ] ) .",
    "the lack of source photons with energy above 2 kev results in a soft best - fit power - law model .",
    "this is rarely seen from other non - thermally emitting pulsars .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that the x - ray emission of psr  b1916@xmath1114  is non - thermal .",
    "a neutron - star hydrogen atmosphere ( nsa ) model ( with magnetic field strength set to @xmath9 g ; @xcite ) could also fit the pn and mos spectra .",
    "however , the parameters are even less constrained in comparison with the blackbody model .",
    "we had to freeze the mass of the neutron star to 1.4 @xmath60 and the distance to 2.1 kpc to get a better - constrained fit ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath42 is @xmath62@xmath44 , @xmath53 is @xmath63 kev , and the resulting best - fit neutron - star radius is @xmath06 km .",
    "unfortunately , the radius is not well constrained in this model and has a 1@xmath1 upper limit of 20 km .",
    "the model predicted 0.12 kev x - ray luminosity is @xmath64ergs  s@xmath17 .      to search for x - ray pulsations from psr  b1916@xmath1114 , we folded all the pn source events from a total 25 ks exposure without filtering for the background flares using 16 phase bins and a contemporaneous ephemeris which was derived from radio timing data obtained using the 76-m telescope at the jodrell bank observatory @xcite .",
    "the mos full - window mode data is useless for timing analysis because of its 2.7 s time resolution .",
    "a total of 374 pn photon events were extracted without filtering for background flares , all in the range of 0.1 - 2 kev , from a source region of 15@xmath34 radius chosen to reduce the number of background photons and improve the signal - to - noise ratio . from the same energy band and the same ccd ,",
    "1945 events were found in a circular background region of 50@xmath34 radius where no source was detected by the sas tool edetect_chain .",
    "if the background is uniformly distributed , there should be 175@xmath654 background photons in the source region .",
    "the folded and binned light curve was fit to a constant line .",
    "the best - fit @xmath66 was 9.6 for 15 degrees of freedom",
    ". therefore no significant pulsations were detected .    in order to determine an upper limit on the pulsed fraction",
    ", we simulated event lists with the same total number of counts as in the observed event list .",
    "the simulated event lists were generated assuming the signal has a sinusoidal profile starting at a random phase and a specified area pulsed fraction , where the area pulsed fraction is defined as the ratio of the pulsed part of profile to the entire profile . for a sinusoidal profile @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the count rate , @xmath31 is the amplitude , @xmath7 is the dc level , and @xmath69 is the phase",
    ", the area pulsed fraction is @xmath70 . by specifying different area pulsed fractions",
    ", we found that , if we set the area pulsed fraction of the simulated event lists to 35% , then approximately 68% of them would be detected with @xmath71 significance .",
    "because there are @xmath0175 background photons in the 374 photons from the source region , the 1@xmath1 area pulsed fraction upper limit of the pulsar is @xmath72 .",
    "this is not an especially interesting constraint because the number of source photons was so small that even a highly pulsed signal could have gone undetected .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of psr  b1916@xmath1114 is soft , and therefore is most likely thermal .",
    "the blackbody temperature lies in the range of 0.080.23 kev , and the best - fit effective temperature of nsa model is @xmath63 kev .",
    "given psr  b1916@xmath1114 s age , its temperature is consistent with what one would expect ( @xmath73@xmath74 kev ) from minimal cooling models in which magnetic field is not considered @xcite .",
    "its estimated bolometric luminosity ( @xmath75erg  s@xmath17 ; table [ tabspecfit ] ) is somewhat low when compared with the curves of page et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , suggesting that the pulsar may have a light - element envelope .",
    "however the substantial uncertainties on the luminosity preclude a firm conclusion .",
    "on the other hand , fast cooling models predict much lower temperatures ( @xmath76 ev ; e.g. yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) which would be undetectable with current instruments .",
    "therefore , fast cooling seems unlikely for psr  b1916@xmath1114  from our observation .",
    "the small best - fit blackbody radius ( @xmath77 km ; table [ tabspecfit ] ) suggests polar - cap reheating .",
    "if the emission of the pulsar is due to curvature radiation , return - current heating is predicted to give rise to an x - ray luminosity ( see @xcite and eq .",
    "7.2 in @xcite for details ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 is in yr , @xmath22 is in s , and @xmath7 is in g. for psr  b1916@xmath1114 , @xmath80 is @xmath81erg  s@xmath17 , only a factor of @xmath03 smaller than the estimated blackbody bolometric luminosity ( see table [ tabspecfit ] ) . if the emission is due to inverse compton scattering , the return current heating will be much less effective @xcite .",
    "given that the best - fit blackbody parameters are not well constrained , we can not rule out return current heating as the origin of psr  b1916@xmath1114 s x - ray luminosity .",
    "we note that the nsa model ( section [ sec : spec ] ) yields a larger radius , although it is also not well constrained .    to compare the properties of psr  b1916@xmath1114  to those of other x - ray - detected radio pulsars ,",
    "we have collected the temperature , magnetic field strength , and spin - down energy of a dozen such pulsars from the literature , and listed them in table [ tabpsrs ] . for pulsars in this table",
    ", we also made plots of their temperature versus age and magnetic field ( figs .",
    "[ fig : agekt ] and [ fig : bkt ] , respectively ) . given the large uncertainty on the temperature measurement from our short - exposure observation of psr  b1916@xmath1114 , we can not conclude here whether thermal emission is consistent with minimal cooling or if the neutron star is hotter than lower - magnetic - field pulsars of the same age , as expected in some models @xcite .",
    "a longer observation in the future may be able to distinguish among thermal models",
    ".    however , we note with interest that the previously published temperature of psr j0538 + 2817 is surprisingly high , in spite of its relatively large age ( 40 kyr ) and relatively low magnetic field ( @xmath82 g ; table [ tabpsrs ] ) .",
    "in contrast to psr  b1916@xmath1114 , psr  j0538 + 2817 s emission is unlikely to be from polar - cap reheating because of the very high required efficiency for conversion of @xmath83 to x - ray luminosity , @xmath84 , compared with the @xmath85 predicted by equation  1 above for this pulsar .",
    "if correct , the high temperature suggests a wider range of possible temperatures for young neutron stars than is currently predicted . this would be a challenge to the @xcite model .",
    "although psr  b1916@xmath1114  is detected by _",
    "a point source with no evidence of extended emission , it is still possible that extended emission was too faint to be detectable . based upon the number of counts in the background region ,",
    "we found that , in the 0.38 kev band , extended emission of surface brightness smaller than @xmath86  count  s@xmath17arcsec@xmath87 would not be detected ( with 3@xmath1 significance ) in our observation .",
    "this limits our sensitivity for detecting a very faint pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) like that of the geminga pulsar , which has a surface brightness of @xmath88  count  s@xmath17arcsec@xmath87 @xcite in the same energy range , despite the fact that geminga is closer by a factor of @xmath08 .",
    "assuming there is an undetected pwn around psr  b1916@xmath1114   having a spectrum like that of the geminga pwn ( power law with index 1.0 ) , we can estimate the upper limit of its surface brightness to be @xmath89  erg  @xmath44s@xmath17arcsec@xmath87 , in the 0.38 kev range .",
    "if we further assume that the pwn is uniformly distributed in a circular region of radius 20@xmath34 , then this surface brightness upper limit corresponds to a pwn luminosity upper limit of @xmath03@xmath90  erg  s@xmath17 .",
    "@xcite showed that the presence of a very high magnetic field could cause inhomogeneous thermal conductivity in the neutron star crust and lead to the formation of hot spots on the neutron star surface .",
    "it could also cause strong radiative beaming of the thermal emission from the neutron star .",
    "these effects could give rise to highly pulsed x - rays , as in the @xmath91 pulsed fraction observed from the high - magnetic - field radio pulsar psr j1119@xmath56127 @xcite .",
    "however , limited by the exposure time of the observation , we did not detect any x - ray pulsations from psr  b1916@xmath1114 .",
    "future longer observations will be useful for better constraining its pulsed fraction .",
