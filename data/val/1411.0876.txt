    "photonuclear reactions and the inverse radiative - capture reactions , in particular radiative neutron capture , play a central role in the synthesis of heavy elements in various stellar environments @xcite and also in next - generation nuclear technologies , such as the transmutation of long - lived nuclear waste @xcite . as these reactions include the excitation and deexcitation of nuclear states at high excitation energy and large level density , the so - called quasicontinuum of states , the statistical reaction theory is the basis for calculations of rates of these reactions .",
    "a critical input to such calculations is photon strength functions that describe average electromagnetic transition strengths .",
    "modifications of the strength functions can change reaction rates considerably .",
    "for example , modifications of the electric dipole ( @xmath3 ) strength function have drastic consequences for the abundances of elements produced via neutron capture in the r - process occurring in violent stellar events @xcite .    in the calculations using statistical codes ( e.g. talys @xcite ) , usually @xmath3 , electric quadrupole",
    "( @xmath0 ) , and magnetic dipole ( @xmath4 ) strength functions are taken into account . in the energy range below the particle - separation energies , which is relevant for radiative capture reactions ,",
    "the dipole strength function is dominated by the low - energy tail of the isovector electric giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "the gdr is considered as a collective vibration of the neutron system against the proton system .",
    "the damping of the vibration is described by a lorentz curve as a function of the photon energy @xcite .",
    "combinations of two or three lorentz curves are used to describe the double or triple humps of the gdr caused by quadrupole and triaxial deformation of the nuclei @xcite .",
    "such a parametrization gives a good description of the experimental photoabsorption cross section @xmath5 = 3 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 of nuclei in the ground state .",
    "the so - called brink - axel hypothesis @xcite expresses the assumption that the strength function does not depend on the excitation energy .",
    "this means that the strength function describing the absorption of photons is identical with the one for the emission of photons from highly excited states , for example following neutron capture .",
    "the generalized lorentzian ( glo ) @xcite includes a correction to the standard lorentzian ( slo ) @xcite , which accounts for the temperature of the nucleus emitting the photons . the magnetic dipole @xmath9 contribution to the strength function used in statistical - reaction codes",
    "is also approximated by a lorentz curve with parameters derived from systematics @xcite .",
    "this curve accounts for the spin - flip mode that appears around 8 mev @xcite .    in several experiments , deviations from the phenomenological strength functions",
    "have been observed .",
    "a bump of the @xmath4 strength around 3 mev in deformed nuclei is generated by the scissors mode , which is interpreted as a small - amplitude rotation of the neutron system against the proton system @xcite .",
    "after it had been well established in the absorption spectra of the ground state , it was recently also identified in the emission from highly excited states @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath3 strength has been found in the energy region from about 6 mev up to the respective neutron - separation .",
    "this additional strength on top of the low - energy tail of the gdr is considered as the pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) which is interpreted as the vibration of excessive neutrons against the symmetric @xmath10 neutron - proton system .",
    "a review of experimental studies of the pdr can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lorentz curves used for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 strength functions , which decrease toward @xmath7 = 0 , an increase of the dipole strength below 3 mev toward low @xmath11-ray energy has been found in several nuclides in the mass range from @xmath12 50 to 100 , such as @xmath13fe @xcite , @xmath14ni @xcite , various mo isotopes @xcite , and @xmath15cd @xcite .",
    "neither of these measurements were able to distinguish clearly between @xmath3 and @xmath4 strength , although an indication for an @xmath4 character of the low - energy enhancement was discussed for the case of @xmath14ni @xcite . in an analysis of @xmath4 strength functions deduced from shell - model calculations of a large number of transitions in the isotopes @xmath16zr , @xmath1mo , @xmath2mo , and @xmath17 m @xcite we showed that the low - energy enhancement of the dipole strength can be explained by @xmath4 transitions between many close - lying states of all considered spins located above the yrast line in the transitional region to the quasi - continuum of nuclear states . inspecting the wave functions ,",
    "one finds large @xmath18 values for transitions between states containing a large component of the same configuration with broken pairs of both protons and neutrons in high-@xmath19 orbits .",
    "the large @xmath4 matrix elements connect configurations with the spins of high-@xmath19 protons re - coupled with respect to those of high-@xmath19 neutrons to the total spin @xmath20 .    in an alternative work",
    "the low - energy enhancement could be described by @xmath3 strength generated by the thermal coupling of quasiparticles to the continuum of unbound states @xcite .",
    "this effect appears at temperatures above 1.4 mev , whereas experimentally deduced values and values predicted by the constant - temperature and fermi - gas models are below 1.0 mev @xcite .    for the @xmath0 strength function a lorentz shape",
    "is recommended as well in the ripl-3 reaction data base @xcite .",
    "the lorentz function in combination with the factor @xmath21 produces an unrealistic pole at @xmath7 = 0 .",
    "an experimental test of the real behavior of the @xmath0 strength function at low transition energy has not been feasible so far .",
    "however , model calculations may gain information about the @xmath0 strength function at low energy .",
    "as our shell - model calculations were successful in describing the low - energy enhancement of the @xmath4 strength observed in various experiments @xcite , these calculations are expected to predict also the low - energy behavior of the @xmath0 strength functions in the considered nuclei near @xmath22 = 50 .",
    "in the present work we present shell - model calculations of @xmath0 transition strengths in @xmath1mo and @xmath2mo .",
    "the calculations were performed by means of the code ritsschil @xcite using a model space composed of the @xmath23 proton orbits and the @xmath24 neutron orbits relative to a @xmath25ni core .",
    "the configuration space was tested in detail in our earlier shell - model studies of nuclei with @xmath26 @xcite and was found appropriate for the description of level energies as well as @xmath4 and @xmath0 transition strengths in nuclides around @xmath27 = 90 . as a further test , we compared the energies of yrast and yrare levels in @xmath1mo and @xmath2mo from the present calculation with the experimental ones , which agree within 300 kev .",
    "the calculations included states with spins from @xmath28 = 0 to 10 for @xmath1mo and from @xmath28 = 1/2 to 21/2 for @xmath2mo .",
    "two protons were allowed to be lifted from the @xmath29 , @xmath30 orbits to the @xmath31 orbit and two neutrons from the @xmath31 orbit to the @xmath32 orbit .",
    "this resulted in configuration spaces with dimensions of up to about 16000 . for each spin the lowest 40 states were calculated .",

    "this resulted in more than 36000 @xmath0 transitions for each parity @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which were sorted into 100 kev bins according to the excitation energy of the initial state @xmath41 or the transition energy @xmath42 .",
    "the average @xmath33 value for one energy bin was obtained as the sum of all @xmath33 values divided by the number of transitions within this bin .",
