    "investigation of diffusive transport is of highest importance in many areas of physics and related sciences .",
    "the most fundamental characteristics of diffusion is provided by two quantities  the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 and the drift velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the knowledge of the latter is especially important in studies of non - equilibrium phenomena , where usually @xmath3 .",
    "this includes , among others , diffusion in disordered media subject to an external field @xcite or the so called molecular `` pumps '' and `` motors '' @xcite , responsible for transport of various chemicals in biological cells .",
    "however , no universal _ and _ practical theoretical method of determining @xmath0 and @xmath1 for arbitrary systems has been developed , and although many solutions for some particular physical models have been proposed , in more complicated cases one often has to resort to approximations or numerical methods .",
    "the first , to our knowledge , attempt towards determining @xmath0 and @xmath1 in an arbitrary system was made by derrida @xcite , who considered a one dimensional , periodic lattice of a period @xmath4 and arbitrary hopping rates between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "he managed to give exact expressions for the velocity and the diffusion constant as functions of the hopping rates .",
    "he then extended his method @xcite to a periodic @xmath5-dimensional system , but his solution turns out to be rather complicated .",
    "an alternative method of calculating @xmath0 was also developed by kehr _",
    "_ @xcite . of the two quantities , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the latter is of course much harder to find .",
    "a surprisingly simple formula for one - dimensional systems with transition rates satisfying the detailed balance condition was derived by lyo and richards @xcite , and recently independently reinvented by kutner @xcite and wichmann @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath4 is the period of the lattice , @xmath7 denote the equilibrium site occupancy probabilities , and @xmath8 are transition rates from site @xmath9 to @xmath10 . however , this equation is valid only when the random walker hops between nearest - neighbor sites . a method of determining @xmath1 in arbitrary periodic systems satisfying the detailed balance condition",
    "was then proposed by braun and sholl @xcite .",
    "description of several other techniques , developed for some special types of random environments , can be found in review articles @xcite .",
    "all the above - mentioned methods are based on the following scheme :    1 .",
    "reduce the infinite system to a single elementary cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "2 .   write down the master equation .",
    "3 .   using it calculate the steady - state properties of this system ; in particular , find the steady - state site occupation probabilities @xcite or propagators@xcite .",
    "4 .   given these quantities ,",
    "find @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the third step is here critical and can be carried out explicitly only for relatively small systems or for models possessing some special properties , e.g , one - dimensional lattices with jumps restricted to the nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to develop a simple and , at the same time , general method of calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 explicitly without performing detailed analysis of the steady state . in our approach",
    "the third step reads    1 .",
    "find the matrix @xmath11 representing the fourier transform of the master equation .    which is a rather straightforward operation .",
    "the technique we propose is valid for both equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems .",
    "it can also be quite easily implemented in computer - algebra or numerical programming languages .",
    "following the first step , our considerations will be restricted to periodic systems , such as crystals or molecular motors .",
    "a general problem of diffusion in an arbitrary disordered system remains an open question .",
    "one might be tempted to treated it by taking the limit @xmath12 .",
    "this method can sometimes provide a hint about anomalous type of diffusion in a given aperiodic system @xcite .",
    "however , except for some simple models @xcite , it has not been established whether the limits @xmath13 and @xmath14 commute and thus , whether this approach is generally correct",
    ".    we will pay a special attention to a one - dimensional system of finite period @xmath4 with arbitrary jump rates between any of its sites whose distance is less than @xmath4 .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest model of a periodic system where all elements of the transition rate matrix can take on nonzero values .",
    "its investigation can be therefore carried out with relatively simple mathematical formalism . a solution to a general",
    ", multi - particle and multi - dimensional problem requires the same mathematical methods , but the notation would have to be complex .",
    "what is even more important , any periodic system with finite number of sites in its elementary cell can be mapped on such a one - dimensional system ; geometry of the original problem is relevant mainly in constructing the matrix @xmath11 and can be taken into account quite easily .",
    "once the explicit form of @xmath11 has been found , one can compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the methods we derive here for this simple one - dimensional system .",
    "in our calculations we will use both continuous - time and discrete - time formalisms .",
    "one could expect that since we calculate @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a stationary state , where all quantities are independent of time , both approaches should yield the same result .",
    "however , as was found by derrida @xcite , the form of the diffusion coefficient as a function of the transition rates can depend on whether time flows continuously , or not .",
    "this is an important issue , since using discrete - time models belongs to favorite techniques of computer physics ( in particular the cellular - automata @xcite , and the exact - enumeration @xcite methods ) , and one needs to know whether results obtained in this way are correct .",
    "derrida @xcite showed that in his ( grossly simplified ) model the relation between the diffusion constants obtained in the continuous - time ( @xmath1 ) and discrete - time ( @xmath15 ) formalisms reads @xmath16 .",
    "we will show that this relation is general and will prove it for any periodic system with arbitrary transition rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . using the fourier transform of the master equation ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite , in section [ secgen1 ] we analyze a one - dimensional system with arbitrary period @xmath4 and transition rates @xmath17 .",
    "we find a simple technique of calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of the 3 lowest coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the fourier - transformed transfer - matrix , @xmath11 .",
    "the most important properties of its spectrum at @xmath18 has been already described in refs .",
    "@xcite , but only for systems obeying the detailed balance condition .",
    "therefore , in sections [ sectioncont ] and [ sectiondiscrete ] we analyze in detail the spectrum of @xmath11 in a general case , assuming that the time is a continuous or a discrete quantity , respectively .",
    "then , in section [ comparison ] we compare the two approaches and explain the different forms of diffusion coefficients derived in each of them . in section [ sectotgen ]",
    "we generalize our approach to systems in arbitrary space dimension , and in section [ secnn ] we present a particularly simple method of calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 for one - dimensional systems with transitions between the nearest - neighbor sites . in section [ secappl ]",
    "we derive explicit forms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in some commonly used models .",
    "in particular , one of the examples studied there explains how to apply our technique to many - body problems .",
    "finally , section [ secconcl ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "consider a one - dimensional lattice with its sites located at @xmath19 , @xmath20 . at time",
    "@xmath21 we put a particle at site @xmath22 .",
    "the particle can then jump between the lattice sites .",

    "the ( constant in time ) transition rate from a site @xmath19 to a site @xmath23 will be denoted by @xmath24 .",

    "mathematically irreducibility means that @xmath53 has exactly one eigenvector whose all components are strictly positive .",

    "a decrease of the diffusion coefficient in the discrete - time formalism can be also interpreted as a consequence of the fact that a discrete process tends to be `` less random '' that a continuous one .",

    "although we know that on average there will be one jump to the right per unit time , we do not know when it will actually occur .",

    "first , if in a periodic system there is a stationary drift ( @xmath176 , then the continuous - time diffusion coefficient @xmath1 is bounded from below . that such a bound exists can indirectly imply bounds on other physical quantities , e.g. , the maximal force exerted by a molecular motor @xcite .",
    "second , _ suppose _ that ( [ dd ] ) , and hence ( [ d > v2 ] ) , is also valid in _ infinite _ ( aperiodic ) random systems .",
    "whenever the diffusion is sublinear , i.e , whenever @xmath177 , there is @xmath178 .",
    "equation ( [ dd ] ) would then imply that @xmath179 , or @xmath180 .",
    "this would mean that whenever diffusion is sublinear (  subdiffusion ) , the drift is also sublinear ( `` subdrift '' ) or vanishes altogether .",
    "the asymmetric hopping model with bond disorder can serve as an example of an infinite system where such relation is actually observed @xcite .",
    "suppose we want to calculate the drift velocity @xmath181 and the diffusion tensor * d * in a system with @xmath5 euclidean coordinates .",
    "if the system can be divided into a _ finite _ number of subsystems with constant transition rates between each two of them , our major results ( [ l0 ] )  ( [ h0 ] ) and ( [ dfpkt1 ] ) remain valid irrespective of the geometry of the system .",
    "such division is always possible for periodic systems with finite number of sites in the elementary cell .",
    "the matrix @xmath182 is the most `` sensitive '' to the geometry of the system under consideration .",
