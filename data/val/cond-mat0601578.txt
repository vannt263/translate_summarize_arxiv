    "despite being a well established concept in the physics of interacting electrons , direct evidence of wigner crystallization @xcite has been reported unambiguously in only a limited number of systems , namely electrons at the surface of liquid helium , @xcite and in semiconductor heterostructures of extreme purity .",
    "@xcite in both cases , a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is realized at an interface between two media , for which the jellium model of the homogeneous electron gas constitutes a good approximation .",
    "alternatively , the charge ordering phenomena observed at low temperatures in a number of _ solids _ have been either interpreted as some form of wigner crystallization , or ascribed to the presence of long - ranged coulomb interactions .",
    "these include the one - dimensional organic salts ttf - tcnq , @xcite ( tmttf)@xmath0x , @xcite ( di - dcnqi)@xmath0ag , @xcite the ladder cuprate compounds sr@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite and chain compounds na@xmath4cuo@xmath0,@xcite as well as the layered superconducting cuprates @xcite and possibly the two - dimensional bedt - ttf organic salts .",
    "@xcite for such systems , the jellium model is _ a priori _ a rather crude modelization , and the concept of wigner crystallization must be generalized to account for other competing effects such as the periodic potential of the underlying lattice , chemical impurities , structural defects , magnetic interactions , etc . in narrow band solids , for instance , the interplay with the host lattice of ions can strongly affect the charge ordering pattern especially at highly commensurate band fillings .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , when the radius of localization of the particles is larger than the typical ion - ion distance , the host lattice can be replaced to a good accuracy by an effective continuous medium , restoring _ de facto _ the validity of the jellium model .",
    "@xcite    setting aside the important problem of the commensurability with the host lattice , and neglecting disorder and other effects that can certainly play a role in the compounds under study , we come to the following observation : a common feature shared by the experimental systems listed above is that they are all _ quasi low - dimensional _ solids , i.e. they are bulk three - dimensional ( 3d ) compounds where the transfer integrals between different chemical units are so anisotropic that the carrier motion is effectively restricted to two - dimensional ( 2d ) atomic layers , or one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains .",
    "yet , the coulomb forces retain their three - dimensional character , being long - ranged and _ isotropic_. in such systems , inter - layer ( inter - chain ) interactions can not be neglected , leading eventually to a full three - dimensional ordering of the charges .",
    "@xcite this suggests why quasi low - dimensional solids are a particularly favorable ground for the observation of wigner crystallization : the electron - electron interactions have the same behavior as in bulk three - dimensional systems , but the kinetic part is strongly reduced by the effective lowering of dimensionality . reminding that a wigner",
    "crystal arises from the competition between potential and kinetic energy , this results in a sizeable stabilization of the crystal as compared with the usual 3d case . ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 in 3d , 2d and 1d respectively ) while the madelung energy in the opposite classical limit is less dependent on dimensionality [ @xmath7 for the body centered cubic lattice , @xmath8 for the hexagonal lattice ] .",
    "incidentally , the crystallization transition in both 3d ( @xmath9 ) and 2d ( @xmath10 ) takes place at the same value of the ratio @xmath11 . ]    a similar conclusion is reached by observing that , even compared to purely low - dimensional systems such as the 2deg mentioned above , the wigner crystal phase could be stabilized in quasi low - dimensional solids due to the presence of additional interlayer interactions .",
    "this topic has been analyzed in the literature in the framework of bilayer quantum wells , i.e. constituted of two coupled 2d electron systems , where it has been shown that , depending on the strength of the interlayer forces , the ordering pattern can differ from the hexagonal structure expected in a single layer .",
    "@xcite more importantly , it was found@xcite that at interlayer separations comparable with the mean interparticle distance , the melting density is raised by a factor of 3 with respect to the pure 2d case , which makes a factor as large as @xmath12 when appropriately scaled to the 3d situation .    in this work , we model quasi two - dimensional ( one - dimensional ) systems as periodic arrays of conducting layers ( wires ) embedded in a three - dimensional bulk material , where the electrons interact through isotropic long - range coulomb forces .",
    "we show that , upon varying the particle density or the interlayer ( interwire ) separation , the wigner crystal undergoes several structural transitions in order to minimize its energy compatibly with the given geometrical constraints .",
    "we then give a semi - quantitative estimate of the melting density for the different structures previously identified , based on the lindemann criterion , which confirms the stabilization of the crystallized phase expected from general grounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce a model for the crystallization of electrons in an anisotropic environment and the method for calculating the crystal energy in the harmonic approximation , which includes the classical madelung energy and the zero - point vibrational energy of the collective excitations .",
    "this is applied to the case of quasi two - dimensional systems , for which the structural / melting phase diagram is determined .",
    "the validity of the present approximation scheme is checked at the end of section ii by analyzing a system of two coupled layers , for which our results compare positively with the numerical results available in the literature .",
    "an analogous discussion for quasi one - dimensional systems is reported in section iii , by treating explicitely the case where the conducting chains form a square array .",
    "the main results are summarized in section iv .",
    "let us consider a system of electrons ( or holes ) of density @xmath13 in a strongly anisotropic environment , such that the particle motion is constrained to equally spaced atomic layers ( at distance @xmath14 ) , but remains isotropic within the layers . to ensure charge neutrality , we assume a uniform 3d compensating background of opposite charge .",

    "it is negligible for @xmath27 , and remains smaller than the madelung term by typically an order of magnitude at @xmath28 .",
    "nonetheless , it can play an important role in determining the relative stability of the different crystal structures , especially when approaching the melting density .",
    "higher orders in the energy expansion @xcite include anharmonic ( @xmath29 with @xmath30 ) and exchange terms of the form @xmath31 , which we shall neglect in the following discussion .    up to quadratic order in the displacements ,",

    "the most general elementary bravais lattice compatible with a given layered structure is identified by a couple of basis vectors describing the ordering within the planes , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and a third vector @xmath40 which sets the relative shift ( @xmath41 ) between two equivalent 2d - lattices on neighboring planes .",
    "other structures , with more than one particle per unit cell , are possible in principle , but will not be considered here .    due to the additional lengthscale",
    "@xmath14 introduced by the layered constraint , the crystal energy is no longer a function of @xmath42 alone .",
    "its dependence on the lattice geometry is best expressed by introducing a dimensionless parameter @xmath43 , which measures of the relative importance of interlayer and intralayer interactions .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the mean interparticle distance in the planes and the interlayer separation , namely @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 defines the 2d density parameter in the individual layers , related to the bulk @xmath42 by @xmath46 .",

    "hereafter , energies and lengths will therefore be expressed in terms of these effective units , characterizing the host medium .",
    "a much more complex situation arises in systems with a frequency - dependent dielectric screening , leading to the formation of polarons , for which the reader is referred to refs.@xcite .",
    "following the hierarchy of the series expansion introduced above , we start by searching for the layered configuration which minimizes the electrostatic repulsion between the particles , which is appropriate in the limit of large @xmath42 .",
    "the calculation is performed by standard ewald summation techniques , which split the slowly convergent series in eq .",

    "[ fig : madelung ] .",
    "two distinct regimes can be identified . in the limit of large separations ( @xmath56 ) , the coupling between the layers is weak , and the resulting planar pattern is hexagonal , with a staggered interlayer ordering , i.e. the particles on the neighboring layers falling on top of the centers of the triangles .",

    "the different curves correspond to different planar configurations : hexagonal ( h ) , square ( s ) , centered rectangular ( cr ) , rectangular ( r ) and rhombic ( rh ) .",
    "the interlayer orderings in the simplest cases at low @xmath43 are sketched below the curves ( for the r and cr structures , the stacking varies as indicated by the double arrows ) .",
    "the resulting three - dimensional wigner crystal reduces to a perfect bcc at the points marked by filled dots , whose energy is indicated by the horizontal arrow . ]    upon reducing the interlayer separation so that @xmath57 , the increasing interlayer interactions make the hexagonal pattern energetically unfavorable . above @xmath58 , a more isotropic ordering of the charges",
    "is stabilized , which presents a centered rectangular ( cr ) structure in the planes .",
    "further increasing @xmath43 leads to a sequence of structures whose planar patterns are respectively squared ( s , in the interval @xmath59 ) , rectangular ( r , @xmath60 ) , centered rectangular ( cr , @xmath61 ) , a generic rhombic , or oblique phase ( rh , @xmath62 ) , then hexagonal again , and so on .",
    "such phases are all connected by continuous structural transitions , with the exception of the hexagonal structure , which is attained through a discontinuous change of the crystal parameters .",
    "note that in the very narrow interval @xmath63 , a generic structure with rhombic planar symmetry is stabilized , which allows to evolve continuously from the rectangular to the centered rectangular patterns ( not shown ) .",
    "the sequence of structural transitions goes on at larger values of @xmath43 .",
    "the interlayer ordering is shown at the bottom of fig.[fig : madelung ] .",
    "it is staggered for the first three patterns ( h ) , ( cr ) and ( s ) for @xmath64 , as expected for large interlayer separations , where the relative ordering is fully determined by the coupling between two adjacent planes , and indeed coincides with what is found in bilayer systems @xcite ( see section [ sec : bilayer ] below ) . at larger values of @xmath43 , the interactions beyond the nearest planes become relevant , which makes the simple staggered ordering unfavorable .",
    "for instance , a staggered / non - staggered transition takes place within the rectangular phase at @xmath65 , corresponding to a relative sliding of the planar structures on adjacent planes in the direction of the long bonds ( indicated by the double arrow in fig .",
    "remarkably , each of the phases identified above contains a special point @xmath66 where the ideal bcc structure which has the lowest possible madelung energy in three dimensions is itself compatible with the layered constraint .",
    "the different planar configurations identified above then correspond to the different ways of cutting a bcc by an array of equally spaced layers .",

    "yet , since the madelung energy is determined by the interactions with a large number of ( distant ) neighbors , the structures found here are expected to be relatively soft against local deformations .",

    "we have analyzed the quantum melting of the different wigner crystal structures realized in such bilayer system by making use of the lindeman criterion discussed in the preceding section .",
    "we see from fig . 6 that both the sequence of phases and the critical melting densities obtained within the present quadratic approximation are in satisfactory agreement with the more sophisticated numerical results of refs .",
    "@xcite ( the melting density is slightly underestimated as compared with qmc , but quite similar to the dft result ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the same trends observed in the preceding section for the layered solids are already present in the single bilayer . in particular , reducing the interlayer separation leads to a sensible stabilization of the crystal compared to the isolated layers .",

    ", the enhancement of wigner crystallization in this case should be even more pronounced than in the two - dimensional case , because of the suppression of electronic motion in two transverse directions rather than one .",
    "the effect is even more dramatic if we consider that a quantum crystal with genuine long - range order can not be realized in a pure one - dimensional system,@xcite while it is stabilized if we account for the long - range coulomb interactions between carriers on different wires .",

    "we shall consider here a square array of wires for illustrative purposes , although the specific arrangements occurring in real solids ( rectangular , rhombic ) can be treated case by case . assuming a simple ordering of period @xmath143 within the wires and an interwire distance @xmath14 , the most general elementary three - dimensional bravais lattice compatible with the given geometrical constraint is described by the following basis vectors : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",

    "the interwire interactions vanish and the limit of isolated wires is recovered : the madelung constant @xmath54 diverges due to the isotropic distribution of the jellium , as explained previously ( cf .",

    "the interwire ordering is staggered , with @xmath154 , corresponding to a body centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice in three - dimensional space .",

    "we have investigated the wigner crystallization of electrons in quasi low - dimensional compounds , where the carrier motion is effectively low - dimensional , while the coulomb interactions are assumed long - ranged and isotropic .",
    "the system properties are found to depend crucially on the ratio @xmath43 of the mean interparticle spacing within the conducting units ( layers or chains ) to the separation @xmath14 between units . while the behavior expected for isolated units",

    "in addition to this rich phase diagram , the presence of isotropic coulomb interactions in such anisotropic compounds results in a strong stabilization of the charge ordered phases , possibly up to densities of practical interest , where the characteristic energy scales of the wigner crystal can become comparable with other relevant scales in the solid .",
    "although it is clear that the interplay with several other factors such as the periodic lattice potential,@xcite chemical impurities,@xcite polarons@xcite or magnetic interactions@xcite should be considered for an accurate description of real materials , the long - range coulomb interactions appear in light of the present study as a key ingredient to understand the charge ordering phenomena in quasi low - dimensional systems .",
