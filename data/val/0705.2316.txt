    "none of the previous analysis of the x - ray data of rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( henceforward rxj1856 ) revealed any significant periodicity @xcite . on the contrary a recent xmm - newton observation of rxj1856 has discovered that this isolated neutron star pulsates with a period of @xmath3 s @xcite .",
    "this object has a completely featureless x - ray and optical spectra .",
    "the lack of any significant spectral features in the x - ray spectrum argues against a heavy element atmosphere @xcite , whereas single temperature hydrogen atmosphere fits over - predict the optical flux by a large factor @xcite . as the soft x - ray spectrum",
    "is well fitted by the planckian spectrum with a temperature @xmath4ev @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the star has no atmosphere , but a condensed matter surface @xcite .",
    "such a surface might emit a featureless , likely a blackbody spectrum , at a temperature close to that of the surface , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the overall spectra of this source has often been described by a two - temperature blackbody models @xcite , because the parameters derived from x - rays do not fit the optical data , which shows the rayleigh - jeans slope with an intensity a factor of 6 larger than that of a x - ray emission .",
    "alternatively a recent paper by @xcite explains the observed featureless spectra of this object assuming that the star has a thin magnetic , partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere on top of a condensed surface .",
    "though , one of important uncertainties for this model appears to be a creation of thin hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "however , to make these models work , the ns has to have a condensed matter surface , which requires the specific conditions @xcite .",
    "also , it remains to be seen weather a detailed analysis of magnetically condensed matter confirms the required non - uniform distribution of the surface temperature ( two - component blackbody model ) .",
    "so we must conclude that existing models , based on an assumption that the emission of rxj1856 has a thermal nature face numerous problems .    in the present paper",
    "we propose our explanation of the detected pulsations in the x - ray emission of rxj1856 , which is naturally possible based on emission model developed by @xcite . in this paper",
    "it is assumed that the emission of this object is generated by the synchrotron radiation , which is created as the result of appearance of pitch angles during the quasi - linear stage of the cyclotron instability .",
    "we suppose that the model proposed by @xcite works , which assumes the case of a nearly aligned rotator , whereas the periodic variations of the observed emission may be caused by the presence of a very low frequency , nearly transverse drift waves in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "these waves propagate across the magnetic field and encircle the open field line region of the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "they are not directly observable but only cause the periodic change of the direction of the pulsar emission @xcite .    in this paper , we give a description of the emission mechanism in section 2 .",
    "the mechanism of change of the pulsar radiation direction is described in section 3 , our model is presented in section 4 and conclusions are done in section 5 .",
    "as it is known the pulsar magnetosphere is filled by a dense relativistic electron - positron plasma .",
    "the ( e@xmath5e@xmath6 ) pairs are generated as a consequence of the avalanche process ( first described by @xcite ) and flow along the open magnetic field lines .",
    "the plasma is multi - component , with a one - dimensional distribution function ( see fig.1 from @xcite ) and consists of the following components : the bulk of plasma with an average lorentz - factor @xmath7 ; a tail on the distribution function with @xmath8 and the primary beam with @xmath9 .",
    "the main mechanism of wave generation in plasmas of the pulsar magnetosphere is the cyclotron instability .",
    "generation of waves is possible if the condition of the cyclotron resonance if fulfilled @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the particle velocity along the magnetic field , @xmath12 is the lorentz - factor for the resonant particles and @xmath13 is the drift velocity of the particles due to curvature of the field lines ( @xmath14 is the radius of curvature of the field lines and @xmath15 is the cyclotron frequency ) . here",
    "cylindrical coordinate system is chosen , with the @xmath16-axis directed transversely to the plane of field line , when @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radial and azimuthal coordinates . during the quasi - linear stage of the instability",
    "a diffusion of particles arises as along , also across the magnetic field lines .",
    "therefore , plasma particles acquire transverse momenta and begin to rotate along the larmor orbits .",
    "the synchrotron emission is generated as a result of the appearance of pitch angles .",
    "in @xcite it has been assumed that the emission of rxj1856 is generated by the synchrotron mechanism , which is created as the result of the cyclotron instability .",
    "though , the original waves excited during the cyclotron resonance come in the radio domain , the radio emission is not observed from rxj1856 .",
    "this waves as well as the x - ray and optical emission propagate along the local magnetic field lines .",
    "one of the possible explanations why the radio emission is not detected from this object is that it is generated at lower altitudes in contrast to the x - ray and optical emission and might miss our line of sight .",
    "another explanation is that the radio emission covers a large distance in the pulsar magnetosphere ( since the model of the aligned rotator is used ) .",
    "so there is a high probability for it , to come in the cyclotron damping range @xmath19 @xcite . in this case",
    "the radio emission will not reach an observer .",
    "* - rotation , * k * - emission and * a * - observers axes . angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are oscillating with time.,width=5 ]",
    "considered distribution function should generate various wave - modes in certain conditions .",
    "particularly it has been shown @xcite that a very low frequency , nearly transverse drift waves can be excited .",
    "they propagate across the magnetic field , so that the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is close to @xmath26 . in other words , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "the period of the drift waves @xmath29 can be written as @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pulsar spin period , @xmath32 is the lorentz - factor of the relativistic particles and @xmath33 is the magnetic field in the wave excitement region ( @xmath34 is the magnetic field at the pulsar surface and @xmath35 is the radius of the neutron star ) .",
    "it appears that the period of the drift waves can vary in a broad range .",
    "the magnetic field of drift wave adds with the pulsar magnetic field as @xmath17 component and causes changing of the curvature of field line .",
    "even a small change of @xmath36 causes significant change of @xmath37 .",
    "variation of the field line curvature can be estimated as : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a longitudinal component of wave vector and @xmath17 is distance to the center of the pulsar .",
    "it follows that even the drift wave with a modest amplitude @xmath40 alters the field line curvature substantially @xmath41 .    since the pulsar emission propagates along the local magnetic field lines",
    ", curvature variation causes change of the emission direction , with the period of the drift waves .",
    "there is unequivocal correspondence between the observable intensity and @xmath42 ( the angle between the line of sight of an observer and the emission direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "maximum of intensity corresponds to the minimum of @xmath43 .",
    "the period of pulsar is the time interval between neighboring maxima of observable intensity i.e. minima of @xmath43 . according to this fact",
    ", we can say that the observable period depends on time behavior of @xmath43 and as it appears below it might differ from the real spin period of the pulsar .    from pulsar geometry",
    "it follows that @xmath23 can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the pulsar , @xmath46 is the angle between the rotation and the observer s axes , @xmath47 is the angle between the rotation and emission axes ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and @xmath48 is the amplitude of changing of @xmath22 .    in the absence of the drift wave @xmath49 and consequently the period of @xmath43",
    "equals to @xmath50 . on the other hand , if the angle between the rotation and emission axes is too small i.e. @xmath51 , then the period of @xmath23 equals to @xmath52 . in this case",
    "the observable period @xmath53 does not represent the real spin period of the pulsar , but equals to the period of the drift wave , which we suppose to be 7.055 s. when the real spin period of this object has been estimated by @xcite to be @xmath54 .",
    "hence , for some values of parameters @xmath47 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath21 it is possible to explain the 7 s pulsations of rxj1856 .",
    "if we consider this object in the framework of our model its angular parameters will get the values shown in table 1 .",
    "simulated lightcurve for rxj1856 is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which well expresses the value of the pulsed fraction of only @xmath2 ( the smallest ever seen in the isolated x - ray pulsars ) , obtained from observations @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we propose our explanation of recently discovered 7 s pulsations in the isolated neutron star rxj1856 , based on model drawn by @xcite .",
    "the main feature of this work is that the spin period of pulsar might differ from the observable one , which is the consequence of existence of very low frequency drift waves in the region of excitement of the pulsar emission .",
    "these particular waves are not detected but only result in a periodical change of curvature of the magnetic field lines , which in turn cause the change of observed radiation with a period of the drift wave .",
    "drift wave driven model is very convenient , since it makes able to explain almost every feature of known extraordinary pulsars such as : extremely long period radio pulsars @xcite , rotation radio transients @xcite , anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite .",
    "we suppose that treatment of the real period of rxj1856 can be achieved by more detailed observations . in the case of nonzero @xmath20 , which is most likely ,",
    "variations with different time - scale should be appeared with value of the pulsar spin period , see fig .",
    "if this is confirmed , it will benefit to our model .",
    "we are grateful to george machabeli for valuable discussions .",
