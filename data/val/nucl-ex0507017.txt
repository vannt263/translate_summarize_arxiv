    "the experimental status of the basic ideas relating the onset of deconfinement and the fluctuations in nuclear collisions are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "a summary given in section 4 closes this report .",
    "the na49 large acceptance spectrometer @xcite was constructed with the aim to study event - by - event fluctuations . in a letter of intend @xcite",
    "it was argued : `` the focus on an analysis of macroscopic and microscopic observables , referring to the _ individual events _ , stems from our expectation that the phase transition , due to the statistical fluctuations in the collision dynamics , may not uniformly occur in the _ average _ central pb+pb collision '' .",
    "the first data on central pb+pb collisions at 158@xmath1 gev were taken during the na49 running period 1994 - 1996 and soon after the pioneering analysis of event - by - event fluctuations started .",
    "it appeared to be more difficult than originally expected .",
    "in particular the problems were caused by :    * a need to control the experimental biases on event - by - event basis , * a difficulty to remove the influence of trivial fluctuations in collision geometry , * the absence of quantitative models predicting event - by - event fluctuations in case of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "numerous measures of fluctuations were proposed , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , and their advantages and disadvantages were vividly discussed .",
    "clearly a choice of the measure depends on the physics goals .",
    "it should maximize the sensitivity to the effects which we are looking for and minimize the sensitivity to the biasing contributions ( experimental and physical ) .",
    "due to all these problems the first results on transverse momentum fluctuations @xcite and the fluctuations of the kaon to pion ratio @xcite in central pb+pb collisions were published only in 1999 and 2000 , respectively .",
    "the measured fluctuations ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_mpt ] and [ fig_kpi ] ) are approximately reproduced by a `` mixed event '' model in which uncorrelated production of hadrons is assumed .",
    "they clearly demonstrate that possible fluctuations of the early stage energy density within the analyzed event sample , if existent , do not lead to significant changes of the event properties .",

    "together with the data on all inelastic pb+pb interactions at these energies , they allow to study system size dependence of event - by - event fluctuations .",

    "the predicted @xcite rapid changes in the energy dependence of hadron properties averaged over central pb+pb collisions , like pion and kaon mean multiplicities and transverse mass spectra , were observed @xcite . the search for the expected anomalous behavior of other quantities is in progress . among them",
    "event - by - event fluctuations are of particular importance .",
    "this is because they are expected to be sensitive to the physics properties of the system which are not accessible in the study of the mean quantities . in the following section we review current status of the ideas and the experimental results on the energy dependence of electric charge , multiplicity and strangeness fluctuations in the domain of the onset of deconfinement",
    "a simple estimate of the net electric charge fluctuations show that they are much smaller in a quark - gluon plasma than in a hadron gas @xcite .",
    "this difference is caused by smaller charge units in the qgp ( fractional charges of quarks ) than in the hadron gas .",

    "[ nc_data ] suggest only a very weak , if any , dependence on energy .",

    "see the original publication @xcite . ]",
    "these results do not necessarily exclude reduced fluctuations in the qgp because these can be masked by contributions from resonance decays .",
    "in fact a simple model of the qgp hadronization and resonance decay can quantitatively explain the magnitude of the measured fluctuations , see fig .",

    "the prediction for the ideal qgp is indicated by the dashed curve ( qgp ) , whereas the prediction for the qgp including hadronization and resonance decay is shown by the dotted curve ( qgp+hadronization ) . for more details",
    "see the original publication @xcite . ]",
    "the influence of resonance decays on charge fluctuations depends on the size of the rapidity interval , @xmath9 , in which fluctuations are calculated .",
    "if @xmath9 is much bigger than the typical distance in rapidity of the daughter particles , @xmath10 , the charge within the interval will not be changed by the decay and therefore the charge fluctuations should not be affected . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 is small , a large fraction of daughter particles will leave the interval and the initial net - charge will be significantly changed .",
    "the mean rapidity difference of two pions originating from decays of @xmath11 meson is approximately one unit of rapidity .",
    "therefore in order to minimize the decay effect @xmath9 should be much larger than 1 . however , this constraint is difficult to fulfill at sps and lower energies because the width of the rapidity distribution of all produced particles , @xmath12 is not much broader than 1 .",
    "hence a rapidity interval which is large enough to be unaffected by the resonance decays would contain almost all particles produced in a collision .",
    "the net - charge in this interval would then reflect the number of participant protons and the fluctuations would be determined by fluctuations of the collision centrality and not the particle production mechanism . a sketch which illustrates these considerations",

    "@xmath9 is the acceptance window in rapidity , @xmath10 is a typical distance in rapidity of decay products of resonances and @xmath12 is the width of the rapidity distribution of all particles .",
    "the observation of the predicted suppression of the net - charge fluctuations in qgp requires : @xmath13 .",
    "this condition is not fulfilled at the sps energies where @xmath14 . ]    at the sps and ags energies @xmath15 and consequently the net - charge fluctuations are not sensitive to the initial qgp fluctuations .",
    "hence their energy dependence may be not affected by the onset of deconfinement .",
    "it was suggested that properly filtered multiplicity fluctuations should be sensitive to the equation of state at the early stage of the collision and thus to its changes in the deconfinement phase transition region @xcite .",
    "this idea follows from the expectation that the early stage energy density changes from collision to collision and thus it causes fluctuations of the thermodynamical parameters of the matter like temperature , pressure , entropy and strangeness . obviously the relation between energy density fluctuations and fluctuations of the other thermodynamical parameters depends on the equation of state .",
    "this opens a possibility to study equation of state via properly defined analysis of event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "this basic idea is sketched in fig .",
    "[ sketch_temp ] for the case of the temperature fluctuations in the phase transition domain .     a sketch illustrating how the early stage energy density fluctuations lead to temperature fluctuations which depend on the equation of state .",
    "the solid line shows equation of state with the 1st order phase transition .",
    "the width of the vertical bands indicates early stage energy density fluctuations for three different collision energies , whereas the width of the horizontal bands gives the corresponding temperature fluctuations . ]    as the entropy is closely related to the particle multiplicity , and it is expected to be approximately conserved during the evolution of the matter created at the early stage , the fluctuations of entropy are of primary interest .",
    "based on the second principle of thermodynamics it can be shown @xcite that the relative entropy fluctuations are given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote entropy and energy , respectively , @xmath19 is pressure and @xmath20 energy density .",
    "for the experimental study the measure of multiplicity fluctuations , @xmath21 was proposed @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dynamical fluctuations of particle multiplicity and energy , respectively .",
    "they are related to the variance of particle multiplicity @xmath25 as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are dynamically averaged statistical fluctuations which can be measured using the sub - event method @xcite .",
    "the measure @xmath21 is directly related to the early stage equation of state @xcite : @xmath28 and therefore it should be sensitive to the onset of deconfinement .",
    "as it is defined as a ratio of relative multiplicity and energy fluctuations it is insensitive to the magnitude of the early stage energy density fluctuations .",
    "one should underline that the method assumes that the early stage entropy fluctuations are proportional to the dynamical multiplicity fluctuations , but it does not require knowledge of the value of the proportionality factor .",
    "this is a clear advantage in regard to the methods of studing the equation of state based on the analysis of the average quantities .",

    "a detailed study of multiplicities fluctuations in different statistical ensembles is in progress @xcite .",
