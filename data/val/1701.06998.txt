    "wetting of solid surfaces by liquids is important both from fundamental and practical points of view @xcite .",
    "liquid wets a solid surface , if the young equilibrium contact angle @xmath1 ( i.e. , the angle between the surface of the liquid and the outline of the contact solid surface at thermodynamic equilibrium ) vanishes , i.e. , @xmath2 ( complete wetting ) .",
    "the surface is nonwetted ( partial wetting ) for any @xmath3 and it is completely dry for @xmath4 .",
    "the contact angle may vary under the change of external parameters . if @xmath1 while increasing crosses the value @xmath5 , the change from hydrophilicity ( @xmath6 ) to hydrophobicity ( @xmath7 ) occurs .",
    "an interesting problem in the theory of inhomogeneous fluids is to examine a dependence of @xmath1 on external parameters starting from a microscopic picture within the frames of which one can follow how external influences modify interparticle interactions .",
    "the classical density functional method @xcite provides such a possibility since it allows to calculate the properties of a nonuniform fluid on the basis of interparticle interactions .",
    "it is well known that an external electric field is a simple and effective way to change wetting properties .",
    "the most drastic changes in the presence of the electric field occur for ionic or polar liquids ( see , for example , refs .  ) .",
    "the shape and stability of droplets in the electric field , contact angle phenomena in the electric field , as well as electrocapilarity have been of interest for a long time and receive renewed attention because of electrowetting ( see , e.g. , review papers  @xcite and references therein ) . in electrowetting",
    ", one is generically dealing with droplets of partially wetting conductive liquids ( electrolytes ) on planar solid substrates and the applied voltage changes the contact angle .",
    "however , even in the case of noble liquids the electric field can affect the macroscopic properties , and in particular the wetting properties , via coupling to the transition electric dipole moment of atoms .",
    "in the present paper , we intend to follow starting from the microscopic level how an external electric field affects the young equilibrium contact angle for a fluid of atoms . to this end , we consider a simple model of two - level - atom fluid in which the interatomic interactions are changed because of the presence of the field .",
    "furthermore , within the frames of the classical density functional theory approach we calculate the contact angle @xmath1 which depends on the value of the electric field strength @xmath8 .",
    "we show that while the value of the electric field strength increases , the contact angle may increase and cross @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , an increase of the field may lead to hydrophobicity .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we justify the choice of a grand potential functional which depends on an external electric field",
    ". then we report some results for the bulk properties of the system , as well as for the density profiles for two - phase cases : liquid  vapor , substrate ( solid wall )  liquid , and substrate  vapor . knowing the grand potential allows us to find the surface tensions , and then , via the young equation , to obtain the required contact angle @xmath1 .",
    "our main results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] . from these plots",
    "one can see that an increase of the value of the electric field strength @xmath9 increases the wetting temperature @xmath10 ( i.e. , the temperature @xmath10 for which the contact angle @xmath1 vanishes ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , increases the contact angle @xmath1 at fixed temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , may replace wetting by partial wetting , see figs .",
    "[ fig01 ] , [ fig02 ] , and may lead to a changeover from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity , see figs .",
    "[ fig01 ] , [ fig02 ] .",
    "in order to follow how the electric field affects the contact angle we have to begin with writing down the interaction energy of neutral atoms with a time - independent spatially uniform electric field . this might be a puzzle since the atoms have no permanent electric dipole moment .",
    "therefore , we start from the first principles to show how the electric field modifies the interatomic interactions . to be free of secondary complications , we shall consider a simple model of a two - level - atom fluid .",
    "we assume that the energy of excitation of the atom is @xmath11 , the atom does not have the electric dipole moment in the ground state or in the excited state , and the transition electric dipole moment between the ground and excited states is @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in how the electric field @xmath13 modifies the long - range interatomic interactions , while the short - range interactions are described by introducing the atom radius @xmath14 . after switching on the electric field @xmath0",
    ", one can calculate within the framework of the quantum - mechanical perturbation theory with respect to the interaction with the field the second - order results for the energy of a single atom , @xmath15 , or of a group of two atoms at ( a sufficiently large ) distance @xmath16 , @xmath17 , see appendix and ref .  .",
    "we find @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are well known functions which depend on @xmath21 and @xmath22 or on @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , see appendix and ref .  .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath17 given in eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) are the only results one must know in order to find the second virial coefficient of the fluid .",
    "the statistical - mechanical average contains also the averages over orientations of @xmath26 ( and therefore no preferential direction created by the field is expected ) .",
    "bearing in mind that we are interested in the lowest term in @xmath9 only , the orientational averages can be done using a cumulant expansion .",
    "after straightforward but cumbersome calculations ( for details see appendix ) we find the second virial coefficient of the two - level - atom fluid @xcite : @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the dimensionless parameter which characterizes the two - level atom ( in what follows we set @xmath30 for convenience ) , @xmath31 is the dimensionless value of the electric field strength . for",

    "( [ 02 ] ) the contribution of van der waals interactions to the second virial coefficient . for @xmath0",
    "the interaction constant of van der waals interactions increases in accordance with the rescaling @xmath33 .",
    "equation  ( [ 02 ] ) allows us to construct an extrapolated equation of state which already contains the liquid - vapor phase transition , and to find the corresponding helmholtz free energy and the grand potential , as well as to extend the latter findings to a nonuniform case , see reviews @xcite and recent density functional theory studies of wetting @xcite .",
    "we will start from the following grand potential functional : @xmath34 = f_{\\rm sr } [ \\rho ( { \\rm { \\bf r } } ) ] + f_{\\rm lr } [ \\rho ( { \\rm { \\bf r } } ) ] + \\int { \\rm d { \\bf r}}_1 \\rho ( { \\rm { \\bf r}_1})(v ( { \\rm { \\bf r}_1 } )   - \\mu ) , \\nonumber\\\\ f_{\\rm sr } [ \\rho ( { \\rm { \\bf r } } ) ] = \\int{\\rm d { \\bf r}}_1   \\rho({\\rm { \\bf r}}_1 )   \\left(\\ln\\left(\\lambda^3\\rho({\\rm { \\bf r}}_1)\\right ) + \\frac{-1 + 6v\\rho({\\rm { \\bf r}}_1)-4v^2\\rho^2({\\rm { \\bf r}}_1)}{\\left(1-v\\rho({\\rm { \\bf r}}_1)\\right)^2 } \\right ) , \\nonumber\\\\ f_{\\rm lr } [ \\rho ( { \\rm { \\bf r } } ) ] = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\vert { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 \\vert \\ge \\sigma } { \\rm d { \\bf r}}_1 { \\rm d{\\bf r}}_2 \\rho({\\rm { \\bf r}}_1 ) \\rho({\\rm { \\bf r}}_2 ) \\left ( -\\frac{3 a(\\vert{\\bf { e}}\\vert ) \\sigma^3}{2\\pi}\\frac{1}{\\vert { { \\bf r}}_1 - { { \\bf r}}_2 \\vert^6 } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which accounts for the short - range repulsion @xmath35 $ ] of hard - core spheres having the diameter @xmath36 and the long - range attraction @xmath37 $ ] , which depends on the external electric field .",

    "we use the local density approximation which would yield the carnahan - starling equation of state in the uniform limit , see appendix . for @xmath37",
    "$ ] we use the mean - field approximation .",
    "such approximations completely neglect the local correlation structure around an atom and more refined treatments are known for both contributions , of the short - range repulsion @xcite and of the long - range attraction @xcite . nevertheless , the adopted treatment is suitable for the purposes of the present study and more sophisticated approximations go beyond the scope of the present paper .    in what follows",
    "we also need to know the explicit form for the external potential @xmath38 which describes the interaction between the solid wall ( substrate ) and the atoms of fluid .",
    "we assume that the solid wall , say , for @xmath40 is formed with uniformly distributed two - level atoms with the density @xmath41 , which interact with the fluid two - level atoms via the same potential as in the fluid ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the long - range ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) contribution of the semi - infinite planar solid wall to @xmath43 is calculated by integrating the long - range interatomic interaction @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "( [ 02 ] ) ) @xmath45 in what follows we assume @xmath46 for convenience .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , we have assumed that all three phases are influenced by the electric field .",
    "such a case is also experimentally realizable , see ref .  , where the used experimental setup was designed in such a way that the electric field was applied to all three interfaces .    the following remark about the elaborated theory is in order here",
    "as can be seen from the consideration above , the electric field enters the theory only through the increase of the van der waals interactions constant which is simply multiplied by @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the electric field may be eliminated from the theory after introducing an appropriate energy unit . for example , after introducing the critical temperature @xmath50 as the energy unit all dimensionless quantities should be already independent of the field .",
    "calculations reported in the next section confirm this observation .",
    "of course , this feature would be not present in more advanced consideration of the electric field .",
    "the equation for the equilibrium density @xmath51 is given by @xmath52/\\delta \\rho ( { \\rm { \\bf r } } ) = 0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "substituting its solution into eq .",
    "( [ 03 ] ) we get the value of the grand potential of the nonuniform system under consideration @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the volume of the system @xcite .",
    "considering on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ 03 ] ) with @xmath55 the bulk properties , when @xmath56 , we find the critical density @xmath57 , the critical temperature @xmath58 , and the critical pressure @xmath59 of the fluid at hand ; here we have introduced the dimensionless variables @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , see ref .  .",
    "within the adopted approach , the critical density is independent of the field but the critical temperature and the critical pressure increase by the factor @xmath63 . at temperatures below the critical temperature @xmath64 the fluid can be in the form of two coexisting phases ( liquid and vapor ) .",
    "in what follows we consider just such temperatures @xmath65 .",
    "let us explain how to get the contact angle @xmath1 .",
    "first we calculate the liquid  vapor surface tension @xmath66 . to this end",
    ", we consider a nonuniform fluid at @xmath65 in the form of two phases in equilibrium with the planar interface ( see also ref .  ) . for computation purposes , it is useful to assume that the fluid is within the cylindric vessel of the radius @xmath67 and the height @xmath68 , direct the @xmath69 axis of the coordinate system along the cylinder axis , and take the origin of the coordinate system in the middle of the height .",
    "we seek for the equilibrium density @xmath70 ( i.e. , along the cylindric axis ) and the equation for @xmath71 after taking the limit @xmath67 has no traces of the adopted specific ( cylindric ) geometry .",
    "moreover , we know the pressure @xmath72 and the chemical potential @xmath73 of the two - phase system at hand .",
    "we put @xmath74 , but seek for the solution for the equilibrium density @xmath71 which depends on the height @xmath69 . the solution for the density profile @xmath71",
    "gives the value of the grand potential of the two - phase fluid in the cylinder @xmath75 .",
    "the surface tension follows from the relation @xmath76 .",
    "the interface surface tensions substrate  liquid @xmath77 or substrate  vapor @xmath78 are calculated along the same lines , however , one has to take into account the potential of substrate @xmath79 ( [ 04 ] ) , which is situated , say , at @xmath80 .",
    "we initialized the system in the cylindric vessel with the liquid density ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) or the vapor density ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) if @xmath83 .",
    "then we find the equilibrium density @xmath71 , the grand potential @xmath84 , and , as a result , the values of @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "finally , the contact angle @xmath1 is defined by young s equation @xmath87 equation  ( [ 05 ] ) completes the calculation of the contact angle @xmath88 starting from the interparticle interactions .",
    "next , we turn to our findings .",
    "density profiles are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig03 ] and [ fig04 ] .",
    "some dependences of the dimensionless surface tensions @xmath89 and those of the contact angle @xmath1 on the dimensionless value of the electric field strength @xmath90 are reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    ".dependence of the dimensionless interface surface tensions @xmath98 ( liquid  vapor ) , @xmath99 ( substrate  liquid ) , @xmath100 ( substrate  vapor ) , and the contact angle @xmath1 ( in degrees ) on the dimensionless value of the electric field strength @xmath90 at the temperature @xmath101 .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     density profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] show a diffused boundary between two phases , liquid and vapor , which becomes sharper as @xmath90 increases ( compare the solid and dotted curves ) .",
    "this can be explained by an increase of the interatomic attraction as @xmath102 which results in an increase of @xmath64 and therefore the fluid at the fixed temperature @xmath103 turns out to be farther from the critical region .",
    "some structure around the solid substrate seen in fig .  [ fig04 ] is due to the hard - core - sphere repulsion : it manifests itself for @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "it is better pronounced in the case of a more dense liquid phase ( curves 1 , 3 , 5 ) and almost disappears for vapor ( curves 2 , 4 , 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , from fig .  [ fig01 ] one concludes that the wetting temperature @xmath10 increases after the field has been switched on .",
    "the temperature dependences of the contact angle in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] satisfy the relation @xmath105 with @xmath106 , thus implying the wetting transitions of first order @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] one concludes that the contact angle grows with the increasing of the field strength . for temperatures close to @xmath107",
    "the change of @xmath1 is rather steep .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 may cross @xmath108 indicating that the hydrophilic surface ( @xmath109 ) becomes hydrophobic ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath111 the contact angle crosses @xmath5 as @xmath90 varies from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "clearly , the actual value of @xmath1 follows from eq .",
    "( [ 05 ] ) and hence is determined by the interplay of surface tensions @xmath66 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 at a given temperature and electric field strength magnitude .",
    "let us discuss the obtained results . for the case of",
    "the considered two - level - atom fluid , a nonzero electric field increases the long - range attraction in the system .",
    "this leads to an increase of the critical temperature of the fluid @xmath114 and therefore , after the field is switched on at constant temperature the two - phase state gets farther from the critical region .",
    "all surface tensions increase with the increase of the field , see table  [ tab1 ] . according to eq .",
    "( [ 05 ] ) , @xmath115 influences the value of @xmath116 but not the change of its sign .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab1 ] , @xmath77 grows and changes its sign as the field increases . as a result",
    ", @xmath116 may change its sign and the hydrophilic surface ( @xmath117 ) change to the hydrophobic one ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "we adopted a very simple model for the substrate .",
    "the external potential @xmath119 representing the substrate may be made smaller ( e.g. , by a decrease of @xmath120 ) .",
    "then the role of the substrate diminishes : it behaves as a hydrophobic surface even in the absence of the field and is less sensitive to the presence of the field .",
    "however , qualitatively the effect of the field remains the same : the contact angle grows with the increase of the field .",
    "finally it is worth noting , that the growth of @xmath1 slows down for relatively large fields , see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , and our consideration ( which is valid for small @xmath90 only ) does not give hints for complete drying induced by the field .",
    "it is also in order to make here a remark concerning the electric - field - strength scale .",
    "this scale is defined by @xmath121 and is of the order of @xmath122 volts per meter .",
    "such large values of @xmath123 may be expected , since we deal with atomic - scale electric fields . however ,",
    "if the temperature is very close to ( just below ) the wetting temperature @xmath107 even small electric field strengths can produce noticeable changes in @xmath1 .    according to our study , the treatment of the electric field effects on the basis of the lennard - jones fluid ( see , e.g. , refs .  )",
    "should imply a change of the lennard - jones potential parameters to be in agreement with the increase of the van der waals interactions constant by @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the elaborated scheme can be also applied to examine the wetting in the presence of excited atoms which may appear as a result of resonance irradiation @xcite .",
    "a few words about a comparison with the outcomes of alternative approaches which permits to test the quality of the obtained results are in order here .",
    "the most important test requires ab initio calculations of the effective interatomic interactions in the presence of the electric field since this information would check the dependence of the initial grand potential functional ( [ 03 ] ) on the field . however , such simulations are far beyond the scope of the present study . on the other hand ,",
    "the quality of the classical density functional theory results based on the simple grand potential functional ( [ 03 ] ) for a system with the hard - core repulsion and the van der waals attraction is known from previous studies ( e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "to summarize , we applied a classical density functional theory to a simple two - level - atom fluid to examine the effect of an external electric field on the wetting properties . in the considered model the electric field couples to the transition electric dipole moment of atoms resulting in the increase of the long - range interatomic attraction in the system .",
    "just below the wetting temperature the electric field can increase noticeably the contact angle and lead to a passage from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity .",
    "our calculations may refer to the noble fluids in a strong electric field .",
