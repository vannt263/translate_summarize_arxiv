    "the formalism of noncommutative geometry is useful in string theory when one studies certain special points in the moduli space of compactifications . in string theory ,",
    "small size manifolds are related to finite size manifolds by t duality .",
    "however , the required t duality transformation usually does not have a nice limit when the size of the manifold goes to zero .",
    "the form of the t duality which brings the background with the small size manifold to the background with the finite size manifold depends very irregularly on the moduli of the small size manifold , such as the metric and the @xmath4 field .",
    "therefore , one could naively expect that the physics also does not have a regular limit .",
    "but it turns out that there exists a smooth description of physics at very small distances in terms of the noncommutative geometry .",
    "this amazing fact was discovered in string perturbation theory in @xcite and in the study of the matrix theory in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the noncommutative geometry and the string theory has been rigorously derived and made more precise in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have found the zero slope limit in which the noncomutative yang - mills theory becomes a valid description of the open string sector of the string theory , established the relation between the conventional and the noncommutative gauge fields and found the stringy interpretation of the morita equivalence @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all the successfull applications of noncommutative geometry to string theory have so far been limited to flat backgrounds , although the natural prescription for constructing the noncommutative algebra from the background with the @xmath4-field is known in mathematical literature @xcite .",
    "putting a field theory on the noncommutative space effectively introduces the non - locality .",
    "this non - locality should presumably lead to softening some of the field theory divergences ( as discussed , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "one very important example of divergences affected by the noncommutativity is the divergences in perturbation theory ; the study of the effects of noncommutativity in feynman diagramms has been initiated in @xcite .",
    "the other example , directly related to our paper , is the resolution of singularities in the instanton moduli spaces .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that introducing noncommutativity for the field theory on @xmath3 is equivalent from the point of view of the instanton moduli space to considering the adhm construction with the nonzero value of the hyper - khler moment map .",
    "( in other words , it introduces the fayet - illiopoulos terms in the adhm sigma - model ) .",
    "this discovery has an important application in the study of the string theory on anti - desitter space .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite , that this theory has a dual description in terms of the conformal field theory .",
    "more precisely , the type iib string theory on @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is @xmath9 or @xmath2 , is dual to the conformal sigma - model whose target space is the moduli space of instantons on @xmath8 .",
    "this proposal , suggested in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , is valid at the specific subspace of the moduli space . on this subspace",
    ", the fluxes of the nsns @xmath4 field through the two - cycles of @xmath8 are zero .",
    "it was found in @xcite , that the non - zero fluxes of @xmath4 correspond to the non - zero value of the moment map in the adhm construction .",
    "therefore , the string theory on @xmath7 with the nonzero @xmath4 field corresponds to the conformal sigma - model on the moduli space of instantons on the _ noncommutative _ @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to fix the precise relation between the parameters of the noncommutative sym theory and the parameters of the near - horizon geometry .",
    "we will proceed in the following way .",
    "wrapping @xmath10 @xmath11 branes on @xmath8 , @xmath12 @xmath13 branes on the @xmath14th two - cycle of @xmath8 , and adding @xmath15 d - strings unwrapped , we end up having a black string in the @xmath16-dimensional flat space .",
    "the background @xmath7 arises in type iib as the near - horizon limit of this black string .",
    "the corresponding supergravity solution looks in a neighborhood of a given point in the @xmath16-dimensional space as @xmath17 , but the moduli of @xmath8 depend on the distance from the black string .",
    "for such a solution , let us consider the geometry of @xmath8 near the horizon ( which we denote @xmath18 ) and @xmath8 far away from the string ( we denote it @xmath19 ) . given @xmath19 , one can find @xmath18 , using the supergravity equations of motion .",
    "it turns out that @xmath18 can not be arbitrary @xmath9 ( or @xmath2 ) ; the moduli of @xmath18 should satisfy certain attractor conditions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the moduli of @xmath19 can be arbitrary .",
    "therefore , the correspondence @xmath20 is not one - to - one ; there is a whole family of @xmath19 flowing to a given @xmath18 .",
    "the cft dual to the near - horizon supergravity can be found using the procedure suggested by maldacena @xcite .",
    "we look at the worldsheet theory of the corresponding system of branes . in the low energy limit",
    ", it becomes a conformal theory . according to the maldacena conjecture ,",
    "this is the conformal theory dual to @xmath21 supergravity .",
    "the worldsheet effective theory feels the flat background , the one which would be there without branes .",
    "the geometry of this background is @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the moduli of the conformal theory depend on @xmath19 .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned there are many possible @xmath19 which give the same near - horizon @xmath18 .",
    "the low energy theories on the worldvolume of the black string should be equivalent for all the backgrounds @xmath19 flowing to the same @xmath18 .",
    "this is a necessary condition for @xmath23 correspondence to be self - consistent .",
    "it was argued in @xcite , that the equivalence of the conformal theories corresponding to different @xmath19 flowing to the same @xmath18 follows from supersymmetry .",
    "we want to ask the following question : given the family of flat backgrounds @xmath19 flowing to the same near - horizon background , can we find a `` canonical '' representative , the one which gives the simplest description of the @xmath1 worldsheet theory ? at first sight , the most appealing possibility would be to find @xmath19 of a very large size . if we could do that , we would get the description of our cft as the sigma model with the target space being the moduli space of yang - mills instantons .",
    "but it turns out that most of the attractors @xmath18 can not be obtained as the near - horizon limit of the solutions with very large @xmath19 .",
    "( in fact , there is an upper limit on the volumes of @xmath19 flowing to a given @xmath18 ) .",
    "what we can do instead is to find a representative with very _ small _ @xmath19 . for such backgrounds",
    "the low - energy effective action is formulated rather explicitly in terms of the noncommutative geometry .",
    "we can use the results of @xcite relating the shape of @xmath19 and the @xmath4 field fluxes to the parameters of the noncommutative manifold which we will denote @xmath24 . according to @xcite , the effective low - energy theory for the bound state of @xmath25 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 is supersymmetric yang - mills theory on @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the effective low - energy theory for the black string is @xmath27-dimensional sigma - model with the target space the moduli space of instantons on @xmath24 .",
    "( in fact , there is a subtlety here which we will discuss later ) .",
    "this gives the dual description of the near - horizon supergravity .",
    "let us mention an interesting consequence of this correspondence .",
    "it turns out that even if we restrict ourselves to the small - size @xmath19 , there is still the whole family of them flowing to the same @xmath18 .",
    "this gives us the family of noncommutative manifolds having the same moduli space of instantons .",
    "indeed , the corresponding sigma - models should be equivalent ; the equivalence of @xmath28 sigma - models implies that they have the same target spaces , modulo some discrete symmetries ; but the equivalence classes turn out to be connected , therefore the possibility of discrete symmetries is excluded .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that instantons on @xmath3 depend only on the self - dual part of the noncommutativity parameter .",
    "our method allows us to formulate the analogue of this statement for instantons on @xmath2 .",
    "the relation between the near - horizon geometry and the moduli of the dual cft has been studied in great detail in the paper by r.  dijkgraaf @xcite .",
    "the precise correspondence between the parameters of the attractor and the moduli space of the dual cft has been given in that paper . combined with our paper ,",
    "this gives the description of the geometry of the moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative torus .",
    "another application of our formulas is the study of the low - energy dynamics of d - branes wrapped on the torus of the finite size ( of the order @xmath29 ) . the most straightforward way of doing it would consist of two steps : 1 ) study the low - energy worldvolume theory of @xmath11 branes wrapped on @xmath2 ( with the numbers of @xmath25 and @xmath13 specifying the topological sector of this theory ) ; 2 ) compactify this low energy theory on @xmath2 , to get the low energy theory of the black string .",
    "however , we think that performing the first step is very hard for the finite size torus .",
    "we do not know how to construct the low - energy theory describing the slow degrees of freedom of @xmath30 branes of finite size in the nontrivial topological sector .",
    "( the nonabelian born - infeld theory @xcite is valid when the covariant derivatives of the field strength are small , and this condition is not satisfied in our case ) .",
    "but we can bypass the first step and go directly to the low energy dynamics of the black string . indeed ,",
    "our considerations show that it is equivalent to the low energy dynamics of branes wrapped on some very small torus .",
    "therefore , the low energy lagrangian for the black string can always be represented as the sigma - model on the moduli space of noncommutative instantons .",
    "there is a subtlety in the relation between the instanton sigma model and the low - energy supergravity on @xmath31 .",
    "the statement that the low - energy dynamics of the @xmath1 system is described by the sigma - model on the moduli space of instantons follows from the dimensional reduction of the @xmath32-dimensional classical super yang - mills theory on the noncommutative torus . strictly speaking",
    ", we can treat this @xmath32-dimensional theory classically only if it is weakly coupled on the compactification scale . on the other hand ,",
    "classical @xmath21 supergravity is valid only if the radius of curvature of @xmath21 space is large enough .",
    "it turns out that these two conditions are incompatible : we can not trust dimensional reduction in the regime where @xmath21 supergravity is valid .",
    "however , we conjecture that the _ shape _ of the target - space of the sigma - model describing the dynamics of the @xmath1 system is independent of the string coupling constant .",
    "we give two arguments confirming this conjecture .",
    "the first argument is based on considering the dependence of the sigma - model for the @xmath1 system on the parameters of the background .",
    "our considerations in section 3 will imply that the structure of equivalence classes of backgrounds giving the same sigma - model does not depend on @xmath33 .",
    "although this fact does not necessarily imply that the structure of the target space does not dependent of @xmath33 , we think that it supports the conjecture .",
    "the second argument is based on the relation between the world - sheet instantons of the @xmath1 sigma model and the d - instantons of the six - dimensional supergravity .",
    "an example of this relation was given in @xcite .",
    "instantons in toroidally compactified string theories where considered in @xcite .",
    "we argue that under certain conditions there is a correspondence between these two kinds of instantons , and the action of the world - sheet instantons is equal to the action of the supergravity instantons .",
    "the action of the worldsheet instantons is related to the hyper - khler period map of the target space . and",
    "the action of the supergravity instantons can be found when @xmath33 is small from supergravity .",
    "the formula agrees with the period map for the target space conjectured in @xcite and does not contain @xmath34 .",
    "this suggests that the target space for small @xmath35 and large @xmath35 should have the same period map .",
    "therefore the hyper - khler structure of the target space is the same in the regime when we can use dimensional reduction and in the regime when we can trust supergravity .",
    "it was claimed in @xcite that the moduli space of the twisted little string theories on @xmath36 is the moduli space of noncommutative instantons on @xmath2 .",
    "this result was derived by relating the theory on @xmath37 brane to the @xmath38 system , with the @xmath39-brane wrapped on the four - torus .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath38 system on @xmath2 is described by the noncommutative yang - mills theory only when this four - torus is very small .",
    "however , the situation with the @xmath38 system should be similar to what happens with @xmath1 : namely , the moduli space does not depend on some combination of the background fields , and there is a small torus in each equivalence class .",
    "therefore , the moduli space is always the moduli space of noncommutative instantons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    ", we give a brief review of the attractor equations and explain when the supergravity approximation can be trusted . in the third section ,",
    "we give the argument for independence of the sigma - model on certain combinations of the background fields , based on supersymmetry .",
    "this section is auxiliary , and it is not necessary for understanding the rest of the paper .",
    "our arguments based on supersymmetry should be closely related to the argument given in @xcite , but we have tried to make them more precise . in the fourth section , we derive the relation between the asymptotic background and the near - horizon ( attractive ) background .",
    "this section is somewhat technical .",
    "the main formula is ( [ whichareequivalent ] ) , giving the condition for the two backgrounds to flow to the same attractor .",
    "the formula ( [ cih ] ) expresses the near - horizon ramond - ramond fields in terms of the ramond - ramond fields at infinity . in the fifth section ,",
    "we review the correspondence between the string theory on the small torus and the yang - mills theory on the noncommutative torus . combining these results with the results from the fourth section ,",
    "we construct the flows on the moduli space of the noncommutative tori , which leave the moduli space of instantons invariant . in subsection 5.2",
    "we make an observation which suggests that the moduli space of instantons on noncommutative @xmath3 does not receive @xmath5-corrections . in the sixths section",
    "we discuss the relation between the world - sheet instantons and the supergravity instantons . in appendix",
    "a , we review the correspondence between the moduli of the type iib compactification and the points of grassmanian .",
    "the dependence of the moduli of k3 or @xmath40 on the distance from the horizon is given by the `` attractor equation '' .",
    "this equation can be found in many papers , for example in @xcite , although in somewhat implicit form . in this section",
    ", we will briefly review the attractor equations and present them in the form most convenient for our purposes .",
    "we will concentrate on the case @xmath41 .",

    ", we have @xmath46 .",
    "the gravity multiplet contains a graviton , four left - handed gravitini and five antisymmetric tensors with selfdual field strength .",
    "the tensor multiplet consists of an antisymmetric tensor with antiselfdual field strength , four right - handed symplectic majorana spinors and five scalars . to describe the interacting theory ,",
    "we think of the scalars as parametrizing the coset @xmath47 we represent this coset as the manifold of five - dimensional positive planes in the space @xmath48 for a given five - plane @xmath49 , we denote @xmath50 the projector on this plane , and @xmath51 the projector on the orthogonal plane .",

    "( here @xmath200 is the noncommutative torus `` dual '' to the torus @xmath201 at infinity as explained in section 5 ) .",
    "our estimate ( [ estimate ] ) tells us that in the regime when we can trust the supergravity solution in the ads region , the six - dimensional noncommutative yang - mills describing the @xmath1 system moduli pois necessarily strongly coupled on the compactification scale .",
    "therefore , we can not trust the classical dimensional reduction .",
    "we conjecture that the shape of the target space of the sigma - model on @xmath202 which is the dimensional reduction of this six - dimensional theory actually does not depend on the six - dimensional coupling constant .",
    "we will give some evidence confirming this conjecture in section 6 .",
    "in this section we will prove using supersymmetry that two backgrounds flowing to the same attractor give the same low energy effective theory on the worldvolume of the black string .",
    "our argument is very close to the one used in @xcite to prove independence of the hypermultiplet metric on the scalars in the vector multiplet .",
    "we will study some auxiliary brane configuration .",
    "it consists of the system of @xmath34 parallel black strings , all having the same charge @xmath203 .",
    "this system has a coulomb branch .",
    "let us consider the submanifold of this coulomb branch , where @xmath204 black strings sit at one point ( the origin ) , and one is moving around :    we will call that black string which is moving around the `` single black string '' .",
    "we want to look at the worldsheet theory of this single black string .",
    "the low - energy worldsheet theory is some sigma model .",
    "consider the target space @xmath205 of this sigma - model .",
    "it can be parametrized by the position in the transversal @xmath3 plus the internal degrees of freedom , which specify the instanton on @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the size of the moduli space of instantons on @xmath2 is of the order @xmath206 and does not depend on @xmath34 , while the characteristic distances in the transversal @xmath3 are growing with @xmath34 .",
    "( from our solution , we see that @xmath207 . )",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath208 , we can consider the internal degrees of freedom as `` fast '' , and the motion along @xmath3 as `` slow '' .",
    "moreover , in this limit the single black string sitting at some point @xmath209 does not feel that the background changes with the distance from the origin .",
    "therefore , the configuration space of the internal degrees of freedom should be approximately the same hyper - khler manifold as for the black string in flat space .",
    "in other words , in the limit @xmath208 we can think of @xmath205 as a bundle with the base @xmath3 and the fiber the moduli space @xmath210 of internal degrees of freedom of @xmath1 wrapped on @xmath211 : @xmath212 the dependence of @xmath211 on the point @xmath213 ( and therefore the dependence of @xmath210 on @xmath214 ) is dictated by the supergravity solution for @xmath204 black strings sitting at the origin .",
    "our arguments will go as follows .",
    "we will prove , using supersymmetry , that although the moduli of the torus @xmath2 depend on the distance from the origin , the fiber @xmath215 does not .",

    "therefore , independence of @xmath216 on @xmath220 implies that the target space for @xmath1 is the same for all the backgrounds @xmath221 , @xmath217 .",
    "since @xmath222 depends only on the distance @xmath116 of @xmath220 from the origin , we had proven that the moduli space of @xmath1 is the same for the backgrounds from the given one - parametric family @xmath223 , @xmath224 $ ] . in particular , it is the same for @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "this implies , that all the backgrounds at infinity @xmath227 which flow to the same near - horizon @xmath225 give the same moduli space .",
    "let us proceed with the proof .",
    "we want to understand what kind of restrictions the supersymmetry imposes on the geometry of our target space @xmath205 .",
    "it is useful to start with considering the `` flat '' sigma - model , which describes the dynamics of @xmath1 in flat space ( without @xmath204 strings at the origin ) . in this case",
    ", we would have : @xmath228 where @xmath218 does not depend on the point of the base . both @xmath3 and @xmath218",
    "are hyper - khler , and therefore we get the system with @xmath28 supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , there are two hyper - khler structures on @xmath3 : one with the self - dual hyper - khler forms , and the other with anti - self - dual .",
    "closer examination of the supersymmetry transformations shows that they are different in the left- and right - moving sectors : the left - moving @xmath229 supersymmetry uses self - dual complex structures on @xmath3 , and the right - moving one uses anti - self - dual complex structures .",
    "when we introduce @xmath204 black strings at the origin the flat target space gets corrected ; for example , the metric on @xmath3 is not flat anymore .",
    "nevertheless , our manifold @xmath205 should still support a sigma - model with @xmath28 supersymmetry .",
    "this follows from the fact that our single black string preserves the same supersymmetry as those @xmath204 black strings which we have added .",
    "therefore , introducing these @xmath204 black strings does not break any more supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath28 supersymmetry implies the existence of six complex structures , three for the left - moving sector , and three for the right - moving @xcite .",
    "the sigma - model action can include torsion , which is an antisymmetric tensor @xmath230 with @xmath231 .",
    "the lagrangian is : @xmath232 here we denote @xmath233 the coordinates in @xmath3 , and @xmath234 the coordinates in the fiber ( the moduli space of instantons ) .",
    "the complex structures should be covariantly constant , but with respect to the modified connection , with the torsion @xmath235 added .",
    "the sign of the torsion is opposite for the left and the right connections .",
    "we will write this condition explicitly for the corresponding khler forms : @xmath236 ( the index @xmath237 distinguishes between the three different khler forms , and the sign @xmath238 distinguishes between the right and the left sectors ) . in our situation , we know something about these six complex structures from comparison to the `` flat '' case . we know that in the vicinity of a given fiber , the khler forms are : @xmath239 here @xmath240 are the basic self - dual ( with plus ) or anti - self - dual ( with minus ) forms on @xmath3 , and @xmath241 are the khler forms on flat @xmath218 .",
    "the corrections are small , because locally our background is almost flat coincide with the right khler forms , therefore it might seem strange that we are using the superscript @xmath238 to distinguish between @xmath242 and @xmath243 . the reason why we distinguish them is the following .",
    "the forms @xmath244 should be covariantly constant ( with modified connection ) . in particular , they should be covariantly constant along the radial direction in @xmath3 .",
    "although the three - dimensional space generated by @xmath245 and @xmath246 coincide , we do not apriori exclude the possibility that the covariantly constant bases in these spaces are different in left and write sectors . ] .",
    "we also have some information about the torsion .",
    "first of all , the torsion is proportional to the background ramond - ramond fields .",
    "indeed , the corresponding term in the black string effective action violates parity . in the brane picture",
    ", parity turns a black string into an anti - black string .",
    "it is the same as changing the sign of the ramond - ramond fields .",
    "therefore , the torsion should be zero if the ramond - ramond fields are turned off . also , we know that in flat case the torsion is zero",

    "the components of the torsion along @xmath218 , @xmath248 , are also zero for the following reason . in the flat case ,",
    "the only ramond - ramond fields are the constant fields along the torus . we know how they couple to our @xmath1 system from supergravity .",
    "they couple to the topological numbers .",
    "therefore , the corresponding contribution to the black string effective action can not change under the small deformations of the fields .",
    "in other words , these constant ramond - ramond fields generate theta - angles in our sigma - model , but not a torsion .",
    "] now we want to see what happens to the torsion when we put @xmath204 black strings at the origin in @xmath3 .",
    "first of all , the components of the torsion along @xmath3 become nonzero . for example , @xmath11 branes from the pile at the origin create @xmath249 , which couples to @xmath25 from the single black string .",
    "closer examination shows that @xmath250 and the other components in @xmath3 are zero .",
    "also , we should admit the possibility that the component @xmath251 is not zero any more .",
    "indeed , the ramond - ramond fields along @xmath2 change when we move in the radial direction .",
    "this implies that theta - angles on @xmath215 may change when we move in @xmath3 .",
    "this precisely means that @xmath252 . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that @xmath248 is still zero , or at least very small when @xmath208 .",
    "ideed , we have seen that @xmath248 is zero when we put our black string in flat background .",
    "the non - flatness of the background can be locally described by the gradient of the background fields , which we can schematically denote @xmath253 ( @xmath140 denotes the background fields ) . from the rotaional symmetry , and assuming the analytic dependence of the torsion on the background fields , we estimate : @xmath254 in other words , it is of the second order in the gradient of the background fields . therefore we will neglect it . also , the other components of the torsion ( for example , @xmath255 , where @xmath14 and @xmath256 are indices from the tangent space to @xmath115 ) are zero because of the rotational symmetry of @xmath3 .",
    "now we want to consider the variation of the period map ( the integrals of the khler forms over the two - cycles in @xmath215 ) , when we move in the radial direction .",

    "in this section we will study the correspondence between the background fields far away from the black string ( we will call them `` asymptotic background '' ) and the background fields at the horizon .",

    "let us summarize what we have .",
    "we have started with the torus of the large size and large b - field .",
    "we have argued that there are localized field configurations , which are the same as supersymmetric configurations on @xmath3 with the @xmath4 field .",

    "this moduli space also has a region corresponding to localized configurations .",
    "it is a natural conjecture ( we did not prove it ) that the localized supersymmetric field configurations on the large torus correspond to the localized configurations on the equivalent small torus .",
    "but the localized configurations on the small torus are described by the zero slope limit , and therefore they are instantons on the noncommutative @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that the moduli space of supersymmetric configurations on @xmath3 does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the moduli space of anti - self - dual connections on @xmath2 has an obvious @xmath487 symmetry : @xmath488 where @xmath489 are real numbers .",
    "this symmetry does not have fixed points .",
    "therefore , the moduli space has a structure of a bundle with the fiber four - torus @xmath490 . in the commutative case ( when @xmath158 ) we could identify this @xmath2 with the dual to the torus on which our yang - mills fields live . in the noncommutative case",
    "we expect more subtle relation between these tori . one way to see it is to notice that the periodic identifications @xmath491 result from the gauge transformations , which are modified for the noncommutative torus .",
    "the gauge transformation with the parameter @xmath492 would not just change @xmath493 , but will instead add some nontrivial function of @xmath494 and @xmath495 to @xmath438 .",
    "shifting @xmath489 by constant will require more complicated gauge transformation , and the periodicity properties of the wilson lines will be changed .",
    "we expect that the torus @xmath496 parametrizing the wilson lines will be different from the geometrically dual to @xmath2 .",
    "notice that in the presence of the @xmath4 field the shape of the torus @xmath2 depends on the representative in the equivalence class of backgrounds .",
    "therefore , if @xmath496 was just geometrically dual to @xmath2 , we would get non - equivalent sigma - models for equivalent backgrounds .",
    "in fact , we know from section 4 that @xmath497 and @xmath498 are invariants of the equivalence relation . therefore , it is natural to conjecture that the hyper - khler structure on the moduli space of flat connections in the bundle with the given @xmath499 is specified by the forms @xmath500 , @xmath501 and @xmath502 where @xmath503 is given by the second line in ( [ familyofnctori ] ) .",
    "we do not know how to prove it in noncommutative geometry .",
    "if the instanton moduli space for one of the tori from the family ( [ familyofnctori ] ) has singularities , then all the tori from this family have singular instanton moduli spaces .",
    "singularities of the instanton moduli spaces are related in string theory to the possibility for the system of branes to split into two or more subsystems preserving the bps condition .",
    "the conditions for the possibility of the decay of the black string have been worked out in @xcite .",
    "the answer is the following .",
    "for the black string with the charge @xmath112 in the background @xmath63 to be able to decay into two strings , one with the charge @xmath504 and the other with the charge @xmath505 , it is necessary that the projection @xmath506 of @xmath504 on @xmath63 and the projection @xmath507 of @xmath112 on @xmath63 are collinear vectors .",
    "this means , that @xmath508 .",
    "in other words , @xmath291 should be orthogonal to @xmath504 .",
    "therefore , singularity or nonsingularity depends only on @xmath509 .",
    "but our definition of equivalent tori is precisely that they have the same @xmath509 .",
    "we get the simplest example of the singular moduli space , if we take @xmath510 , @xmath4 antiselfdual , and turn off the ramond - ramond fields . in this situation , @xmath511",
    "( this is the definition of @xmath4 being antiselfdual ) , and the plane @xmath291 is generated by the three vectors @xmath512 $ ] together with the fourth vector @xmath513 $ ] .",
    "we see that the whole lattice @xmath514 generated by the integer vectors of the form @xmath515 $ ] is orthogonal to @xmath291 .",
    "therefore , our @xmath516 system may decay into @xmath517 and @xmath518 , provided that @xmath519 and @xmath520 .",
    "the corresponding singularity in the moduli space of instantons is due to small instantons .",
    "notice that if we turn on the generic ramond - ramond fields , then the separation of branes becomes impossible .",
    "therefore , although the moduli space of instantons remains geometrically singular , the conformal sigma - model is nonsingular .",
    "the reason is , of course , that we have turned on theta - angles .",
    "it is not true that an arbitrary background with singular instanton moduli space is related to this example by dualities .",
    "indeed , it can happen that the sublattice orthogonal to @xmath291 is not @xmath514 ( and has dimension higher then two ) .",
    "then , the corresponding singularity can not be related to the small instantons by the chain of dualities .",
    "the target space @xmath215 of the @xmath1 sigma - model has a nontrivial second cohomology group .",
    "there is a natural map @xmath521 from the cohomology lattice of @xmath2 to the second cohomology group of the moduli space of noncommutative instantons with the charge @xmath112 .",
    "let us remind how this map is constructed . given a cohomology class @xmath522 , we want to describe how to compute @xmath523 on a cycle @xmath524 .",
    "we describe the embedding @xmath525 as a connection on a vector bundle @xmath526 over @xmath527 .",

    "to derive this formula , we will use the following trick .",
    "we first consider the case of euclidean d - branes wrapped on @xmath535 .",
    "we will take this @xmath535 to be a product of @xmath536 and a small @xmath2 , and go to the dual noncommutative @xmath437 . in this case , we know that the ramond - ramond fields couple to the winding numbers of various d - branes on this six - torus : @xmath537 where @xmath538 is the integer cohomology class of @xmath539 specifying the number of branes wrapped on various cycles",

    "our sigma - model arises on the worldvolume of the @xmath1 system wrapped on @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider the @xmath1 system with the worldvolume not @xmath567 , but some compact riemann surface @xmath528 ( for example , @xmath598 ) .",
    "of course , this system will not be bps and therefore will presumably collapse and decay into gravitons and other fields of six - dimensional supergravity . but let us consider the case when we have nontrivial instanton charge on @xmath528 .",
    "this instanton charge will couple to the ramond - ramond background fields , and therefore it can not decay into the states from the perturbative string spectrum .",
    "in fact it decays into some perturbative state plus one of the d - instantons of the six - dimensional sueprgravity , such as type iib d - instanton , or type iib euclidean d - string wrapped on the two - cycle in @xmath2 , or type iib euclidean d3 brane wrapped on @xmath2 , or a combination of them .",
    "therefore , we can think of d - instantons as black strings with compact worldsheet wrapping a nontrivial cycle in the target space .",
    "do we expect the action of these supergravity instantons to be equal to the action of the corresponding instantons in our sigma - model ?",

    "one reason is that we expect the sigma - model description to break down for small enough worldsheets .",
    "but even if we forget about the possible breakdown of the low energy description , there is still a reason why the action of supergravity instantons is different .",
    "as we have explained in section 5.3 , the sigma - model instanton on @xmath567 usually has nonzero abelian gauge field strength on @xmath567 , determined from minimizing the action .",
    "in generic situation , the flux of this gauge field through @xmath567 is non - integer .",
    "if we want to compactify @xmath567 to @xmath598 or any other riemann surface , we have to change the two - dimensional abelian gauge field so that the flux is integer .",

    ". however , for some special backgrounds and instanton charges , the flux of the abelian field happens to be zero .",
    "the condition for it is that the coupling of the instanton to @xmath599 is the same as the coupling to @xmath600 . in other words , the charge @xmath67 of the supergravity instanton , defined so that the phase factor is @xmath601 , satisfies : @xmath602 we will see that this condition has a natural interpretation in supergravity .",
    "we will argue that if this condition is satisfied ( together with some other conditions ) then the action of the supergravity instanton is equal to the action of the sigma - model instanton .      we will argue that under certain conditions ( including ( [ mutualbps ] ) ) there exists the solution of the euclidean six - dimensional supergravity , corresponding to the black string with the worldsheet @xmath567 and the d - instanton at some distance from it .",
    "this solution preserves four real supercharges .",
    "it has moduli corresponding to the motion of the d - instanton in the space transverse to the black string .",
    "the action does not depend on the position of the d - instanton .",
    "it is possible that such a d - instanton can approach our black string and `` dissolve '' into it , becoming a sigma - model instanton .",
    "we conjecture that the action is not changed in this process .",

    "the @xmath603 brane on top of @xmath34 @xmath13 branes may be thought of as point - like instanton .",

    "we deform it to the finite size instanton , which can be described as a classical supersymmetric field configuration on the worldsheet .",
    "we should stress , however , that it is not always true that the supersymmetric configuration of the supergravity instanton and the d - brane can be represented as a classical instanton on the worldvolume of the d - brane .",
    "for example , the configuration consisting of a single @xmath13 brane and a d - instanton on top of it is supersymmetric ; nevertheless , there are no finite size instantons in the @xmath388 gauge theory living on the worldvolume of the single @xmath13 brane . for our configuration consisting of the black string and the instanton , we do not know whether the instanton can really be represented by the smooth worldsheet field configuration modulo constant .",
    "( the variation of fermion with nonzero constant field strength can be compensated by the @xmath605 transformation , as explained in @xcite . ) ] .",
    "we can probably say that there is always an `` ideal '' instanton represented by the singular fields , but the precise meaning of this statement is not very clear .    to prove the connection between the supergravity instantons and the sigma - model instantons",
    ", we should answer two questions .",
    "the first question is whether the supergravity instanton sitting on top of the brane can be deformed to the smooth supersymmetric solution of the six - dimensional yang - mills equations . in other words , whether the corresponding singular field configuration is just a point on the boundary space of smooth configurations .",
    "the second question is whether this smooth six - dimensional solution ( if it exists ) has a good limit when we shrink @xmath2 to zero size ; if yes , then it should correspond to the instanton of the @xmath1 sigma - model .",
    "we did not prove that the answers to these two questions are positive .",
    "we want to give an example which shows that at least the first assumption is true for some instantons .",
    "some supersymmetric solutions of the six - dimensional yang - mills theory on calabi - yau threefold were obtained ( in the language of complex geometry ) in @xcite .",
    "our example is analogous to the solutions found in that paper .",
