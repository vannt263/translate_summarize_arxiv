    "the first known supernova observed with vlbi was the type ii supernova 1979c , which was only the second supernova detected in the radio , and bartel ( 1985 ) reported a determination of its angular size .",
    "the first vlbi image identified as that of a supernova was one of 41.95 + 575 in m82 by wilkinson & de bruyn ( 1984 ) , although the recent results have cast some doubt on the identification as a supernova ( mcdonald et al .",
    "bartel et al .  (",
    "1987 ) published a higher resolution image of 41.95 + 575 , and then bartel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) published an image of sn  1986j .",
    "since then , radio imaging of approximately ten supernovae has been carried out ( see table  1 below ) , where i use the word `` imaging '' somewhat loosely , meaning supernova for which we have some morphological information , including size determinations , from radio observations .",
    "i will attempt to briefly summarize the state of radio supernova ( rsn ) imaging .",
    "radio imaging is an important tool for the study of supernovae , at least those that are radio bright , ie .",
    "if fact , vlbi radio observations are presently the only means to directly image the expanding shell of any supernova much farther away than sn  1987a . the radio emission is generated as the expanding shell of supernova ejecta interacts with the progenitor star s circumstellar medium ( csm ) which generally consists of its stellar wind .",
    "the expanding shell of ejecta generates two shocks , a forward shock which propagates into the csm and a reverse shock which propagates into the stellar ejecta .",
    "chevalier ( 1990 and references therein ) showed that in the case of density distributions for the csm and the ejecta that are power laws in radius , the solution is self - similar and the supernova shell expands such that its radius , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is time since the explosion and the parameter @xmath3 is commonly known as the deceleration parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath3 will depend on the density distributions of both the csm and of the ejecta , and @xmath4 indicates free expansion .",
    "= 0.60    = 0.86    the interaction region between the ejecta and the csm is an important laboratory for studying shock acceleration , since supernovae are thought to be responsible for the majority of cosmic rays",
    ". we can also learn about both the supernova and the csm .",
    "furthermore , since the speeds of the ejecta are usually several orders of magnitude faster than those typical of red giant winds , the supernova shock over - runs the wind , and thus the interaction region acts like a time - machine , and has the potential to reveal the last thousands of years of the progenitor s wind history . finally , by equating the angular expansion velocity measured with vlbi with the radial expansion velocity measured spectroscopically , a direct , geometric distance determination can be made ( see bartel & bietenholz , this volume ; bartel 1985 ) .",
    "the early vlbi observations of sn  1979c and sn  1986j allowed measurement of their sizes and determination of their expansion curves . figure  [ bieten_f86exp ] shows the expansion curve to date of sn  1986j ( see bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2002 ; for sn  1979c , see bartel & bietenholz , this volume ) .",
    "a power law , as suggested by the chevalier mini - shell model , indeed provides a good fit to the data , with @xmath5 ( but see prez - torres et al .",
    "2002 for a different result ) .",
    "a radio image of sn  1986j is shown in figure  [ bieten_fgallery ] .",
    "several decades - old supernovae have been observed in m82 ( see e.g. , mcdonald et al .",
    "2001 ) , and images of two are shown in figure  [ bieten_fgallery ] . for 43.31 + 592 ,",
    "@xmath3 could be determined to be 0.7 .",
    "radio images of sn  1987a have been obtained using the australia telescope ( see manchester et al .",
    "2002 ) and are also shown in figure  [ bieten_fgallery ] .",
    "its expansion can be shown to have been strongly decelerated .",
    "= 0.85    = 0.93    by far the best studied rsn so far is sn  1993j in the nearby spiral galaxy m81 .",
    "two independent vlbi campaigns have observed it extensively ( see bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2003 ; bartel et al .",
    "2000 ; and marcaide et al .",
    "2002b , 1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the quality of the data allowed both vlbi groups to independently determine departures from simple power - law expansion , with bartel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reporting that @xmath6 was near unity early on , decreased to @xmath70.8 by @xmath8  d , and then increased slightly after that ( see figure  [ bieten_f93exp ] ) .",
    "mioduszewski , dwarkadas , & ball ( 2001 ) performed simulations of an expanding supernova shell , based on a particular model of the ejecta profile , and found changes in @xmath6 remarkably similar to those in fact observed for sn  1993j ( e.g. , bartel et al .",
    "after 10 years , sn  1993j has slowed to less than half its original expansion velocity , which implies that the swept up material is now comparable in mass to the ejecta , and for reasonable mass - loss rates of the progenitor , suggests that the ejecta have a relatively low mass of @xmath9 , and that the progenitor had lost most its envelope mass to a binary companion prior to the supernova explosion .",
    "the images of sn  1993j , shown in figure  [ bieten_f93img ] show a wealth of detail ( see http://www.yorku.ca/bartel/snmovie.html for a movie of the expanding supernova ) . in projection",
    ", the supernova has remained very circular , and phase referencing has shown that it expands isotropically from the explosion center to within 5.5% ( bietenholz , et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "the shell structure is clearly visible in all the adequately resolved images .",
    "there are , however , distinct departures from circular symmetry even at the earliest resolved epochs , where there is a pronounced minimum to the west and a maximum to the east - southeast ( fig .",
    "[ bieten_f93img ] ) . even after 10 years",
    ", no sign of a pulsar nebula has yet been seen at the center .",
    "however , it seems probable that the ejecta in the interior of the shell are dense enough that the radio optical depth due to free - free absorption will remain large for several decades , and hence obscure any emerging pulsar nebula .",

    "the observed shell structures are clear evidence that the bulk of the radio emission originates from the interaction of the expanding shells with their surroundings , rather than from nebulae around the young pulsars , as had also been suggested . despite the relatively circular shells ,",
    "significant intensity modulation with position angle seems the norm .",
    "none of the imaged rsne show a clear case of bisymmetric structure , as might be expected from axisymmetric stellar winds .",
    "there is evidence , however , most compelling from sn  1986j , for some more asymmetric structure , possibly in the form of protrusions or jets .",
    "the origin of the asymmetries and protrusions is not yet well understood .",
    "the observed mostly circular morphologies , do , however , suggest mostly spherical shells , which allow direct distance determinations to be made ( e.g. , bartel & bietenholz , this volume ; bartel 1985 ) .",
    "power - law expansion curves , with @xmath21 , provide a first order fit to all supernovae whose sizes have been determined over a reasonable time baseline except for sn  1987a , which is probably in a much lower density environment than the other radio - bright supernovae .",
    "however , at least in the case of sn  1993j , distinct departures from strict power - law expansion can be seen , implying significant structure in the ejecta and/or the csm . in both",
    "sn  1993j and sn  1986j , the source structure has been shown to change non self - similarly as the supernova expands .",
    "there is an intriguing change in the radio spectrum of sn  1986j , with a new spectral component that peaks at @xmath2220  ghz emerging after @xmath2210  yr , possibly related to a new compact component in the images , that may perhaps be related to a pulsar nebula ( see bietenholz et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "there is still considerable scope for the more detailed understanding of supernova shell dynamics , and for determining the structure of the csm and of the ejecta through hydrodynamic simulations , particularly in the case of sn  1993j where exceptionally good data are on hand .",
    "currently , there are only a couple of rsne per decade that are close enough and bright enough to image .",
    "future improvements in sensitivity , e.g. , the mark  iv vlbi recording system , the evla , and the ska , will allow us to image somewhat more rsne , but will only enable a modest increase in the resolution available to global vlbi ( by going to higher observing frequencies ) .",
    "the practical distance limit is on the order of 30  mpc , where global vlbi at 22  ghz gives a linear resolution of @xmath238000  au .",
    "there have been approximately 8 rsne per decade with a 22-ghz flux density @xmath24  mjy since 1980 , so even with the ska , the number of rsne available for imaging will be limited .",
    "it will therefore be important to image those rsne that are available to us , since they will provide us with direct distance estimates , test our understanding of the supernova process , which may be crucial to understanding the distant , un - resolved supernovae upon which cosmological results are based , and allow us to probe the circumstellar environments and thus the wind - history of evolved stars , and allow us maybe to see the birth of a pulsar nebula .",
