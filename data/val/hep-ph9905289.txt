    "a central issue in describing heavy ion collisions is the question of particle fragmentation , for which there exist several models @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", a description of such a collision usually is made within the framework of non - equilibrium theory in which the equation governing the wigner function that describes the particle distribution @xmath7 semiclassically must somehow be given . from our knowledge of classical systems out of equilibrium and the attendant boltzmann equations ,",
    "it is possible to make _ heuristic anstze  _ for the equations governing the distribution functions of the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "this line of thought has been taken up by several authors in particular from the partonic point of view @xcite , and , based on this , parton cascade codes have been set up that are successful and necessary for the description of hard processes .    on the other hand ,",
    "a convincing formal justification of these heuristic ideas using green function techniques does not yet exist , although steps have been taken in this direction in attempts to derive transport equations directly from the underlying theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , see for example @xcite . by now ,",
    "the basic equations of motion for green functions within a non - equilibrium approach @xcite for any theory are well known : they can simply be written down in a formal sense ; one has a complicated set of matrix dyson equations relating matrices of green functions with matrices of self energies , for each particle species .",
    "the crux of the issue , after wigner transformation , is the determination of these self energies for a given theory .",
    "the lowest order or mean field contributions to the self energy has been studied in several models of bosons or fermions or both , see for example @xcite .",
    "higher order terms that contribute to the self energy and which can be interpreted as giving rise to collisional effects are less well studied .",
    "recently , however , it was shown exactly within a simple relativistic model of quarks , the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite , that all graphs that contribute to second order in the interaction are required to generate two body elastic scattering diagrams that contribute to the differential cross - sections occurring in the boltzmann equation @xcite .    in this current paper , we study a partonic model of qcd inspired by polkinghorne @xcite that contains scalar quarks and scalar gluons that are coupled to each other . in addition , the gluons interact with each other via a triple gluon vertex , simulating the non - abelian nature of qcd .",
    "such a 3-gluon vertex turns out to be sufficient to produce `` pomeron - like '' behavior _",
    "i.e. _ the quark - quark elastic scattering amplitude can be calculated in a perturbative expansion in leading logarithms of the center of mass energy @xmath8 , and such an expansion involves only gluonic ladder like diagrams constructed between the two scattering quarks @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , a 4-gluon vertex would be subleading in the expansion in @xmath0 and is therefore omitted in this model lagrangian .",
    "we will take this as our starting point .",
    "it has the advantage over qcd proper that we can study the consequences of the non - abelian like terms , but we do not have to concern ourselves with the additional problem of gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "there is one additional difficulty , however , that the color structure of the theory becomes necessarily more complicated , but this can be handled relatively easily .    using the scalar partonic model",
    ", we examine the self energies that are required in the non - equilibrium formalism in and beyond the mean field approximation for use in constructing a collision term . within the mean field approximation",
    ", the hartree term is identically zero , due to color traces .",
    "the fock term , which is often ignored in such calculations , is discussed in some detail .",
    "the assumption that this term vanishes also , leads to enormous simplifications in considering higher order terms in the coupling @xmath9 .",
    "we then examine the two gluon exchange diagrams , of which there are several different kinds .",
    "we classify them according to their topology as being of the `` rainbow '' , `` cloud '' , `` ladder '' , `` exchange '' or `` quark loop '' kind .",
    "we find that _ all _ the graphs occurring in this order are required in order to produce the two body partonic differential scattering cross sections that would enter into a boltzmann - like transport equation , in contrast to that suggested in @xcite .",
    "this is an exact result . in our case , regarding for example the equations of motion for the quark distribution function , we find that the relevant cross sections that enter into the collision term at this level are either purely quark like in nature ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , or contain gluon components ( @xmath2 and @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 are suppressed by kinematical considerations . ] . due to the plethora of different types of graphs that already occur at the two gluon exchange level , we seek an additional expansion parameter to simplify this and to enable us to go to higher orders in the coupling . in qcd itself , an expansion in the inverse number of colors is often useful , and we thus examine such an expansion within this model .",
    "an analysis of the color structure of each graph naturally suppresses diagrams containing quark loops and the exchange graphs thereof , as is also a feature of qcd .",
    "all remaining self energy graphs that contain gluonic exchange components ( the ladder , rainbow and cloud graphs ) turn out to be superficially of the same order in @xmath14 , and all are required to generate all possible types of gluon production or quark - gluon scattering",
    ". a closer look , however , shows that the ratio of the ladder to the rainbow or cloud graphs goes as the ratio of the casimir operators of the adjoint to the fundamental representations squared , which favors the ladder graphs numerically .",
    "the two body process is then briefly reanalysed along these lines .    with this point of view ,",
    "the next order in the coupling , i.e. the three gluon exchange is investigated .",
    "examining once again the equation of motion for the quark distribution function , we find that three parton production , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 and @xmath16 , naturally occurs .",
    "in addition to these production processes , however , the processes @xmath17 and @xmath18 must also be accounted for and @xmath19 are suppressed by kinematical considerations . ] .",
    "we thus see that initial as well as final state processes must be included in the matrix elements . with this information , the generalized boltzmann equation that includes multiparton production ( @xmath20 , but also processes of the form @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath6 integer ) within this scalar quark and gluon model",
    "is given .",
    "it is to be noted that , unlike the situation that occurs in evaluating the elastic quark - quark scattering amplitude within the scalar parton model @xcite , we can not _ a priori _ make an assumption on the internal ordering of momenta within a self energy graph .",
    "this comes about in the elastic quark - quark scattering amplitude , because there are two external momenta that are fixed . in a self energy graph , however , and in the boltzmann equation , only one external momentum can be fixed while _ all _ the remaining momenta are integrated over .",
    "thus the simplifications leading to the ladder approximation and regge behavior in that calculation are not simply recovered in the kinetic theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we give a brief introduction to the scalar partonic model , and set our notation for the nonequilibrium dynamics . in section",
    "[ sec : mean ] , we describe the collisional contributions that arize from the mean field self energies , and the associated transport equations . in section [ sec : collision ] , we deal with the collision integral beyond the mean field approach , firstly giving the exact perturbative calculations with two gluon exchange , the color expansion , then three and @xmath6 gluon exchange . we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce and discuss the scalar partonic model , and give the equations of motion for quark and gluon fields .",
    "we then give a brief discussion of transport theory applied to this scalar model , and indicate the self energies that we are required to evaluate .      in the model underpinning our calculations ,",
    "quarks and antiquarks are described by complex scalar fields @xmath23 , and gluons as the scalar field @xmath24 coupled through the lagrangian @xmath25    the quark fields are regarded as massless , as one generally assumes for high energy processes , while the gluons are usually assigned a mass @xmath22 _ a priori _ in order to avoid infra - red divergences .",
    "there is an interaction between quarks and gluons as well as a cubic self - interaction between gluons . since in qcd",
    "the quartic interaction between gluons leads to terms which are sub - leading in ln @xmath8 , such a quartic interaction among gluons is not included within this model .",
    "one notes that both the quark and gluon fields carry two labels .",
    "both of these refer to color groups .",
    "the fact that a direct product of two color groups is necessary can be seen on examining the three gluon vertex term .",
    "this term must be symmetric under the exchange of two gluons since they are bosons .",
    "in addition , one expects that the interaction vertex should be proportional to the ( antisymmetric ) structure constants of the color group .",
    "a single color group can not meet these requirements , and the simplest combination which can is a product of two @xmath26 groups .",
    "thus the gluon field carries two color indices ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "since the quark field transforms in the fundamental representation of both of these @xmath26 groups , it must carry two color indices as well ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the generators and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the structure constants for the two @xmath33 groups respectively .",
    "thus they satisfy @xmath34=if_{abc}t^c,\\quad\\quad [ t^r , t^s]=if_{rst}t^t .",
    "\\label{e : commutator}\\ ] ] note in eq.([e : lagrangian ] ) that the flavor index of the quark fields is suppressed .",
    "the equations of motion for the fields can be derived from the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "they are @xmath35 for the ( anti-)quarks and @xmath36 \\label{motiong}\\ ] ] for the gluons .      for the purpose of establishing our notation , we give the basic definitions and refer the reader to standard texts @xcite .",
    "the quark green functions in the schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite are defined as @xmath37 and for the gluons as @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the usual time and anti - time ordering operators respectively .",
    "as given , the green functions fall along the contour designated in fig .  1 .",
    "our convention follows that of ref.@xcite .",
    "they satisfy a dyson equation that introduces the matrix of self energies for either the quark or gluonic sectors , @xmath41 or @xmath42 . using a generic notation , @xmath43 or @xmath44 and @xmath45 or @xmath42 as appropriate ,",
    "one may write @xmath46 in a standard fashion , the transport and constraint equations can be derived , and this is summarized briefly in appendix a. in terms of the center of mass variable @xmath47 and the fourier transform variable @xmath48 conjugate to the relative distance @xmath49 , or wigner transform , the equations that one obtains for the off diagonal green functions , corresponding to the transport and constraint equations are @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , where @xmath52 is a generic parton mass , @xmath53 for the gluons and @xmath54 for the quarks .",
    "@xmath55 is an abbreviation for the combined functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the collision term , @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 are terms containing retarded and advanced components respectively , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eqs.([e : collision ] ) to ( [ e : pim ] ) , the operator @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 in order to proceed further , we have to calculate the self energies .",
    "it is useful to introduce the quasiparticle approximation , in which a _ free _ scalar parton of mass @xmath52 is assigned the green functions @xmath65 with @xmath66 , and which are given in terms of the corresponding scalar quark and gluon distribution function , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the parton type @xmath70 .",
    "our task in this paper is to construct an equation for the distribution functions for quarks and gluons @xmath67 from eqs.([transport ] ) to ( [ e : pim ] ) , using the quasiparticle green functions of the form given in eqs.([d-+ ] ) to ( [ d++ ] ) .",
    "to do so , it is necessary to integrate the entire eq.([transport ] ) over an interval @xmath71 which contains @xmath72 .",
    "our particular focus will be placed on the collision terms that are derived from eq.([e : collision ] ) . in anticipation of this fact",
    ", we will require such an integration over the terms appearing in eq.([e : collision ] ) , and define @xmath73 to lowest order in an expansion that sets @xmath74 , this integral can be easily performed .",
    "one has @xmath75 _ i.e. _ the off - diagonal quasiparticle self energies are required to be calculated on shell .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the self energies to first order in the interaction strength and illustrate their role in the transport equation in the semi - classical limit .      for the scalar parton model , two generic kinds of hartree graphs can be identified in the quark and gluon self energies .",
    "these are depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "for hartree diagrams of any kind , off diagonal self energies are per definition zero and only diagonal elements can possibly be constructed , _ i.e. _ @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "however , all such diagrams vanish identically in this model .",
    "the reason for this lies in the color factors : for the quark self energy graph in fig .  2 that contains a quark loop , a single su(3 ) color group leads to the associated color factor @xmath78 since @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the gell - mann matrices . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath81 denotes the external quark momentum and is therefore not to be summed over . for the quark self energy containing a gluon line , the color factor for a single su(3 ) group is also vanishing , @xmath82 similar arguments apply to the gluon self energies .",
    "thus , no mass renormalization occurs due to hartree terms .",
    "a semiclassical expansion of the transport and constraint equations thus leads to free streaming described by @xmath83 and the constraint equation is @xmath84 by integrating eq.([e : free ] ) over a positive interval @xmath85 , the equations for the time evolution of the distribution function for quarks and gluons emerge , @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "on integrating the constraint equation , eq.([e : freecon ] ) , one has @xmath88 .",
    "the equation is the expression of the fact that the partons have to be on mass - shell , and is consistent with the quasiparticle assumption , eqs.([d-+ ] ) - ( [ d++ ] ) made in the first place .",
    "the next type of graph contributing to the mean field expansion is the fock term .",
    "the generic diagrams for the quark and gluon self energies are shown in fig .",
    "since we are particularly concerned with the collision integral , we start with the quark sector and examine as an example , the gain term generated by the fock term @xmath89 . by inspection , one has @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the fock color factor for a single su(@xmath14 ) group , @xmath92 the contribution to the collision term that this makes , using eqs.([e : j22 ] ) and ( [ e : onshell2 ] ) is @xmath93 which , on inserting the explicit expressions for @xmath94 and @xmath95 from eqs.([d-+ ] ) and ( [ d+- ] ) leads to four distinct terms , @xmath96 where @xmath97 by attributing unbarred functions @xmath98 to incoming particles and barred functions @xmath99 to outgoing ones , one can see that @xmath100 correspond to the processes @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the last three of these are kinematically forbidden , while the former is possible , since the gluons are endowed with a finite mass . performing the integrals over @xmath105 and @xmath106 , eq.([e : tfocks ] ) becomes @xmath107 the loss term is obtained in a similar fashion or by exchanging @xmath98 with @xmath99 , since the matrix element is symmetric . combining both terms ,",
    "the revised transport equation is obtained on integrating eq.([e : collision ] ) over the energy interval @xmath85 as @xmath108 .",
    "\\label{e : fockcoll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the final expression for the fock transport equation .",
    "one can alternatively introduce a cosmetic recombination or decay rate in which case eq.([e : fockcoll ] ) can be written symbolically as @xmath109 , \\label{e : focktrans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the flux factor , and @xmath111 with the invariant phase space factor @xmath112 given as @xmath113 .",
    "an analysis of the self energy graph 3(a)of the gluon sector , @xmath114 along the previous lines leads to processes @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , all of which are kinematically prohibited .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath118 this can be attributed to the fact that that the self energies are evaluated on shell , i.e. we may write @xmath119 which is the statement that an on shell particle can not decay into two on shell particles of the same kind .    the second graph in the gluonic case does not vanish .",
    "this self energy @xmath120 that enters into the description of the gain in gluons , is precisely that given in eq.([e : sigf ] ) , but with @xmath121 replaced by @xmath122 .",
    "the color factor in this case is also modified , being @xmath123 .",
    "an analysis of the self energy along the same lines leads to the processes @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the last of which is the only term that can contribute .",
    "thus the time evolution of the gluon distribution function is given by @xmath128 .",
    "\\label{e : fockcoll2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we conclude this section by commenting the result that while the fock term 3(a ) for gluons vanishes identically , the fock term for the quark self energy does not .",
    "a term of this kind occurs in this model because the quarks are massless , while the gluons are massive .",
    "the relevance of this fock term thus depends on the form of the underlying theory . in evaluating higher order graphs in the following section ,",
    "it is useful to invoke the so - called `` on - shell argument '' , ignoring all terms of higher order of this kind that contain on - shell decays .",
    "this is necessary in order to render the problem tractable , but it is not strictly true , as has been indicated here .",
    "generic diagrams that contain two loops and which contribute to the quark and gluon sectors are shown in fig .  4 .",
    "in the quark sector , we denote these graphs as rainbow ( r ) , ladder ( l ) , cloud ( c ) , exchange ( e ) and quark loop graphs ( q - loop ) , according to their topology .",
    "these graphs comprise all diagrams with two exchanged gluons . in the gluonic sector , there are more diagrams , as can be seen in the figure .",
    "note that in this sector , a ladder - like diagram is topologically equivalent to the rainbow kind , and is therefore not included separately . since we are specifically interested in the collisional term , we will concern ourselves only with the off - diagonal contributions that arise from these diagrams , as is required in eq.([e : collision ] ) .",
    "in addition , these self energies are required on shell .    to be specific ,",
    "let us deal first with the quark sector , and consider the rainbow diagram first .",
    "then there are four possibilities of ordering the lines in this graph , as is indicated in fig .",
    "5 . however , invoking the on - shell argument , as explained in the previous section for the fock diagram , only the first graph of this series can survive while the other three vanish .",
    "similar arguments can be applied to the remaining graphs , the l , c , e , and q - loop diagrams .",
    "one can set up all possibilities of ordering the lines for each type of graph in fig .  4 , and determine which survive .",
    "the final set of all non - vanishing contributions can then be ascertained .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "we next note that the diagram of fig .",
    "6.4(b ) is the exchange graph of fig .",
    "6.5 , because both of these diagrams contain three off - diagonal quark green functions .",
    "the similarity becomes more evident if one redraws the diagram of fig .",
    "6.4(b ) as shown in fig .",
    "the self energies for two gluon exchange contribute to the quark collision term via @xmath129 where the off - diagonal self energies are constructed from the diagrams of fig .  4 as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 here we have split up the combinations of the second exchange plus quark loop diagrams in @xmath133 , leaving the rainbow , cloud , ladder and first exchange graph to @xmath134 .",
    "this subdivision in eqs.([e : first ] ) and ( [ e : second ] ) to @xmath135 in eq.([e : onshell ] ) will be handled separately , as the first term will be seen to lead to elastic quark - quark and quark - antiquark differential scattering cross sections in the transport equation , while the @xmath134 term will be seen to lead to processes involving gluons in the final state , such as the processes @xmath136 and @xmath2 .",
    "explicit expressions for the quark loop and its exchange diagram self energies required in eq.([e : first ] ) are obtained as @xmath137 and @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are color factors , that will be given explicitly in the following subsection .",
    "since they do not affect our argument , we suppress them in the following .",
    "the integrated collision term , for loss , for example , from eq.([e : onshell ] ) can be directly evaluated , to give the quark loop and exchange contributions @xmath141 where @xmath142 one sees that there are eight terms , or eight processes in this expression . however , due to energy - momentum - conservation @xmath143 and @xmath144 vanish , leaving only @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",

    "the @xmath216 s are normalized to @xmath217 the `` square '' of the generator in some representation must be proportional to the unit operator ( schur s lemma ) . therefore @xmath218 and @xmath219 where the numbers @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the casimir operators of the fundamental and adjoint representation , respectively .",
    "they take the values ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath222 and @xmath223 consider now the quark self energies that were evaluated in the previous subsection .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the external parton index .",
    "it is therefore not to be summed over .",
    "the color factor for the rainbow graph is @xmath224 for the ladder graph , one finds @xmath225 for the cloud graph , one obtains @xmath226 where the relation ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath227 has been used .",
    "the color factor for the exchange graph is @xmath228 where the relation @xcite @xmath229 has been used .",
    "finally , for the quark loop graph the color factor is given by @xmath230 up to this point , we have made a semiclassical expansion that involves keeping only the leading term in expanding the exponential in eq.([lambda1 ] ) ( here the factor @xmath231 has been set to one . )",
    "in addition , we have examined sets of diagrams organized according to the number of interaction lines , i.e. according to the coupling strength .",
    "we have found that all graphs in a class are required in order to build up the cross sections that ultimately occur in a boltzmann like equation .",
    "however , at the level of two exchanged gluons , we are already faced with five types of graphs , and this number increases rapidly with the number of exchanged gluons .",
    "one possible simplifying assumption is the additional imposition of an expansion in the inverse number of colors .",
    "according to such a criterion , the ladder , the rainbow and the cloud diagrams are leading , since their color factors for one color group are of order @xmath232 while for the quark - loop diagram it goes as @xmath14 and for the exchange diagram only as @xmath233 .    since the ladder and the rainbow diagram lead to cross sections involving gluons while the quark - loop diagram leads to elastic quark-(anti)quark cross sections",
    ", one can conclude that the quark degrees of freedom are suppressed in comparison with the gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of an evaluation of the quark - quark scattering amplitude within this model @xcite , in which the quark degrees of freedom are neglected , however due to kinematical reasons .",
    "although the ladder and the rainbow diagram are both of order @xmath232 , the ratio of their color factors for one color group is not one , but @xmath234 which is @xmath235 for @xmath236 . since in the rainbow diagram the second gluon couples at the quark line while in the ladder diagram it couples at the first gluon , two quark - quark - gluon vertices are suppressed by a factor @xmath237 per color group in comparison with two 3-gluon vertices .",
    "thus , there is no _ strict _ ordering of the gluon graphs according to a single class of diagrams , in an expansion in @xmath238 . although the ladder graphs and the processes that they lead to appear largest , one should not that the symmetry factors of the other graphs compensate for this .",
    "a numerical study is essential to determine the actual order of magnitude of each graph .    as a final comment , note that an expansion in color also incorporates the coupling strength . assuming that @xmath239",
    ", we find that the fock term @xmath240 and the ladder diagram @xmath241 are of the same order .",
    "since many diagrams contribute to the self energy with three exchanged gluons , we again make an additional expansion in the inverse number of colors as explained in the previous subsection , and consider only diagrams that do not contain quark loops . in the case of two",
    "exchanged gluons , we have seen that the ladder and the rainbow diagrams give rise to the squared scattering amplitudes of _ individual _ channels .",
    "therefore , we conclude ( and will check later ) that for the case with three exchanged gluons , the three - rung ladder diagram , the rainbow diagram with three bows and all possible mixtures between them will lead to the squared scattering amplitudes of _ individual _ channels of processes involving three gluons .",
    "the generic form of these diagrams is given in fig .",
    "( note : diagrams that would generate crossed terms between the single channels are shown in appendix c ) .    a direct evaluation of the self energy diagrams in fig",
    ".  12 should give rise to cross sections of processes that involve three gluons , _",
    "i.e. _ one expects , for example , the three gluon production @xmath242 but also multiparton production such as @xmath16 .",
    "the generic feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in figs .  13 and 14 respectively .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider now the ladder diagram of fig .",
    "12(a ) , in particular @xmath243 .",
    "there are sixteen possibilities of arranging the signs that can be associated with the vertices of the first and second rungs . invoking the on - shell argument and energy - momentum conservation ,",
    "the possibilities become restricted to the single diagram shown in fig .",
    "the explicit expression for this ladder diagram is @xmath244    once again , one may insert the quasiparticle _ anstze _ for the quark and gluonic green functions from eqs.([d-+ ] ) - ( [ d++ ] ) , and construct the contribution of this ladder term to @xmath245 as in subsection iv a by taking its on - shell value @xmath246 multiplying out the product of green functions in terms of the quark and gluonic distribution functions enables us to identify all processes that can occur .",
    "the details of this cumbersome calculation are given in appendix b. here we simply note that the constraints of energy - momentum conservation admit all processes which have at least two partons in both the initial and final state .",
    "that is to say , in addition to the parton production processes @xmath247 and @xmath16 , that were already mentioned , one also obtains the matrix elements for the processes @xmath248 and @xmath18 .    in order to complete the calculation , the remaining diagrams of fig .",
    "12 and additional self energy graphs that lead to mixed terms of the scattering amplitudes must be calculated in an analogous way .",
    "there are very many such diagrams that build the mixed terms between the scattering amplitudes that were shown in figs .  13 and 14 .",
    "for completeness , we show these in appendix c. we will not however calculate these graphs in any detail here .",

    "we have not been able to find any convincing argument to favor an expansion that only includes ladder graphs , as is for example the dominant contribution in elastic quark - quark scattering in the regge limit , when considered on its own within this model .",
