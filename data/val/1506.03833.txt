    "complex systems is the strongest challenge to quantum theory since its inception .",
    "it is related to the fundamental problem of the complexity of the description of many - particle ensembles at the quantum level , which led to the idea of a quantum computer .",
    "the most critical element in our understanding of the physics of quantum computing is decoherence , which can be described within the concept of an open quantum system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "kossakowsky - lindblad master equation ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , gives the simplest description of an open quantum system , where the influence of environment is expressed by permanent measurements of the system and is represented as markov random process . despite the fact that in many cases this influence can hardly be considered as markov process , and there are non markovian approaches ( see .",
    ", eg , @xcite ; the analytical analysis of interaction with invironment can be found in @xcite ) , the dynamics in terms of the master equation has the simplest form , it makes it easy to compare result with the unitary dynamics of the expansion of the system , where we include some part of the environment to the considered system .",
    "coherence means the presence of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix ; quantum effects are always associated with coherence , and the effects of information nature as quantum algorithms , moreover , require even the existence of entanglement .",
    "influence of environment usually leads to the suppression of coherence and treated as noise in the practical use of quantum effects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in some cases , on the contrary , the influence of the environment can help to maintain the desired quantum effects . the most famous example - quantum zeno effect , in which the measurements allow to conserve the desired quantum state ( see the work @xcite zeno effect in nmr- quantum computing as the freezing of quantum states , coherence protection by zeno effect in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to suppress decoherence by a special noise ( see , for example @xcite ) . in the work @xcitethe non - trivial relationship between the unitary dynamics with lindblad master equation",
    "is described , in particular , the possibility of noise smoothing by a unitary control .",
    "the influence of noise is very important for the conductivity of excitations in groups of two - level atoms enclosed in the optical cavities with the possibility of exchange of photons between the cavities .",
    "excitation conductivity can be used to analyze the transmission of energy and information at the quantum level , in artificial devices and living organisms ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) where the addition of the noise to the model makes it more realistic .",
    "we can formulate the conductivity of excitations in terms of quantum walks ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which have a valuable difference from classical random walks .",
    "for example , quantum conductivity quadratically exceeds classical : the conductivity of the classical walk on a linear chain takes time of the order of squared length of the chain , whereas quantum - of the order of the length ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for the walks on glued trees quantum speedup of the conductivity",
    "will be even exponential(see @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider two important quantum effect associated with conductivity : dephasing assisted transport ( dat ) and quantum bottle - neck .",
    "dat plays an important role in the light harvesting fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex in green sulfur bacteria ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the essence of the dat effect is that the presence of noise at the resonant frequency increases transfer of excitations , so that there is an optimal intensity of the noise when the conductivity is maximal . in the works @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite )",
    "dat effect was investigated on the model of excitation transfer , without the explicit consideration of the interaction between photons and atoms",
    ".    however , artificial reproduction of excitation transfer is important , for example , for the effective conversion of light into chemical energy by optical elements . to simulate such systems we must take into account the interaction of atoms with light explicitly , as is done in this paper .",
    "quantum bottle - neck effect is that the maximum conductivity occurs at the optimum value the force of interaction of the end node with the sink ( flow rate ) .",
    "the excess of this value does not lead to an increase in conductivity ( as in the classical case where the conductivity increases monotonically with the intensity of runoff ) , but decreases it , until the complete disappearance .",
    "this is like dat , purely quantum , and , moreover , counter - intuitive effect .",
    "it is noted in the paper @xcite ( p. 10 ) that the bottle - neck can exist only in the case of coherent exchange between nodes , i.e. it has quantum nature , but there were no exact boundaries for lindblad dephasing , in which this effect arises . in this paper",
    "we present such boundaries .",
    "the physics of quantum effects in the conductivity of excitations is extremely important in biology , as well as in quantum technology , so it is of interest to study these effects in more detail in the framework of jaynes - cummings - hubbard model ( jch ) , introduced in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the explicit consideration of photons and their interaction with atomic excitations explains many quantum effects important for the applications .",
    "these effects can be used in quantum computing : optical cnot gates ( @xcite ) , quantum computations on optical gates ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) - quantum computations on linear optical gates and measurements , photonic quantum memory ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the description of the other quantum effects and their possible applications can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "excitation conductivity has more detailed description in jch model , which depends on its parameters : amplitude of photon jumps between cavities and amplitude of atom - photon interaction inside of one cavity . for example , in the work @xcite excitation conductivity is considered in jch model without phonons .",
    "we make such analysis for the model with phonons and establish the influence of atom - photon interaction to dat effect .",
    "our goal - the quantitative description of two quantum effects arising in transfer of energy along the chain of atoms concluded in optical cavities : quantum bottleneck and dephasing assisted transport ( dat ) .",
    "we formulate a model in which it is possible to combine the simultaneous influence of these effects on the excitation conductivity , and then present the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we also give a brief qualitative explanation of these two effects , and indicate possible ways to use these effects to improve the quantum models of optical systems associated with the conversion of light energy into chemical .",
    "we give a definition , starting with the most detailed model `` excitations , photons , phonons . ''",
    "we consider a linear chain consisting of identical optical cavities with two level atoms inside .",
    "each cavity holds the photons with frequency @xmath0 .",
    "fock state with @xmath1 photons inside @xmath2-th cavity we denote by @xmath3 . inside each @xmath2-th cavity",
    "there is one two - level atom , which eigenstates : ground and excited we denote by @xmath4 correspondingly .",
    "the difference between frequencies of these states ( detuning ) @xmath5 is small in comparizon with each of them : @xmath6 that allows to use rotating wave approximation for the atom - photon interaction at the large enough time frame , and jaynes -cummings model ( jc ) .",
    "in addition , each atom is placed in a bath of thermal phonons that have dephasing effect on its excitation . in this paper",
    "all phonons have the same frequency @xmath7 , for which dat effect is maximal .",
    "in fact , this frequency is equal to the difference between eigen frequencies of the hamiltonian of jch model ( see below ) that are responsible for the transfer of excitations ( see the work @xcite ) .",
    "the transfer of energy from the cavity to cavity occurs through the flight of photons between the cavities where @xmath8 is the amplitude of the flight from the cavity @xmath9 to the cavity @xmath10 per unit of time , so that the amplitudes of the opposing flights are mutually conjugate , that is @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model is thus obtained by adding to the jaynes - cummings hubbard hamiltonian @xmath12 the term of exciton - phonon interaction @xmath13 : @xmath14 here @xmath15 denote operators of creation and annihilation of a photon in @xmath2-th cavity , @xmath16- denote creation and annihilation of a phonon in @xmath2-th cavity , @xmath17- denote creation and annihilation of the excited state of the corresponding atom ( excitation ) , @xmath18 is the amplitude of photon emitting by excited atom in the unit of time .",
    "we assume that the photon jump is possible between the neighboring cavities only where it occurs with the same amplitude so that all @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and for @xmath21 , @xmath22 . constant @xmath23 is the intensity of exciton - phonon interactions ( square root of huang - phys factors ) .    in the simplified model , which we call  excitation - phonon  photons",
    "are ignored , and excitations are transmitted from one atom to the other ; its hamiltonian @xmath24 has the form @xmath25 the inflow of the energy can be viewed either as a constant occurrence of the excitation on the first node , taking the energy income from the outer bath , or simply set the initial state of the first atom as excited , regardless of photons . in the first case",
    "the bath inflows can create excitation irreversibly , or we can simply consider the initial state of a strongly excited field in the first cavity , which interacts with the first atom .",
    "there are two ways for the simulation of dephasing as well . either we consider it as the interaction with the explicit phonons , or as the irreversible process with only excitations and without explicit phonons .    combining all of the above methods of studying the conductivity , we get all kinds of particular computing models . in any case , for the irreversible models master equation of kossakowsky - lindblad",
    "should be applied :    @xmath26    which contains the unitary dynamics @xmath27 as the particular case . here",
    "lindblad operators @xmath28 describe the irreversible part of the process .",
    "for example , the irreversible runoff of excitations to the sink from the last node ( end ) is expressed by the operator @xmath29 , where the positive coefficient @xmath30 expresses the intensity of runoff , dephasing in @xmath2-th node resulted from the interaction with the implicit phonons is reflected by the operator @xmath31 , photon leak through the walls of the @xmath2-th cavity - by @xmath32 , etc .",
    "we consider the resulting quantum effects of excitation conductivity .",
    "we determine the conductivity by the degree of filling sink in a certain time .    1 ) .",
    "quantum bottleneck .",
    "reduction of conductivity with increasing intensity of the runoff .",
    "graph of conductivity depending on the rate of the runoff is not monotonically increasing as would be in the case of classical conductivity , but has a local maximum at a finite rate @xmath33 .",
    "the nature of this counter - intuitive effect is purely quantum .",
    "it can be explained by considering the dynamics of the population of the initial state according to the time when the runoff intensity is large .",
    "if there is no runoff , the dynamics will be similar to the graph of the cosine , which has a maximum point at the initial time .",
    "the runoff constantly destroys the excitation at the end of the chain that makes the density matrix close to the initial state in which a reduction of the excitonic population at the first atom decreases with time very weak .",
    "this process competes with the obvious classic excitonic population decrease with increasing runoff .",
    "if the runoff is strong enough , it constantly holds the density matrix ( and hence population of excitations in the first atom ) in the initial state in which there is practically no reduction of excitonic population at all that results in  freezing  of the population , like in quantum zeno effect , in which the effect of  freezing  comes from frequent measurements of the quantum state . in the case of the classical conductivity instead of cosine fall of excitonic population",
    "we would have a linear decrease , and there would be no bottleneck .    2 ) . dephasing assisted transport - dat .",
    "a plot of the conductivity on the intensity of the noise ( the number of phonons of the resonant frequency , or intensity of the interaction between excitations and phonons , expressed in coefficients of lindblad for dephasing ) has a local maximum at a non - zero point .",
    "this means that there is some non - zero noise intensity at which the conductivity is maximal .",
    "there are quantum processes , connected with the conductivity , the effectiveness of which is enhanced with the increase of noise , for example , mixing at random walks on graphs ( @xcite ) .",
    "effect of dat stands out among them due a special role it plays in biology .",
    "dat as a purely quantum effect .",
    "dephasing is direct suppression of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "quantum dynamics is obtained by adding the amplitude states , the evolution of which leads to the same point of the classical space . dephasing shifts the phase of the amplitude to a certain area . if this area would be narrower than the natural spread of the phase of states in the absence of dephasing",
    ", this influence will make the interference more constructive , thus increasing conductivity .",
    "this effect can be illustrated by the example of road traffic .",
    "if possibilities of cars are the same and allow rapid acceleration and braking , then synchronous mode of motion ( phase conservation ) will support high bandwidth of the road .",
    "but if the possibilities of vehicles are very different , then to increase bandwidth it is needed to the contrary , smooth mode of braking and acceleration , i.e. dephasing .    )",

    "we build the models by binding one a several qubits ( a qubit group ) to a specific state parameter , for example to the excitation of the first atom ( see @xcite ) .",
