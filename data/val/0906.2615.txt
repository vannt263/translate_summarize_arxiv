    "data transmission in the internet network can be described as a self - adaptive system to the different congestion events that regularly occur at its numerous nodes . a connection , a tcp flow , in this network adapts its throughput according to the congestion it encounters on its path : packets are sent as long as no loss is detected and throughput grows linearly during that time . on the contrary when a loss occurs , the throughput is sharply reduced by a multiplicative factor .",
    "this scheme is known as an additive increase and multiplicative decrease algorithm ( aimd ) .",
    "globally , the tcp protocol can be seen as a bandwidth allocation algorithm on the internet . from a mathematical modelling perspective , the description is somewhat more difficult .",
    "while the representation of the evolution of the throughput of a single tcp flow has been the object of various rigorous works , there are few rigorous studies for modelling the evolution of a large set of tcp connections in a quite large network .",
    "a possible mathematical formulation which has been used is via an optimization problem : given @xmath0 classes of connections , when there are @xmath1 connections of class @xmath2 , their total throughput achieved is given by @xmath3 so that the vector @xmath4 is a solution of the following optimization problem @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of admissible throughputs which takes into account the capacity constraints of the network .",
    "the functions @xmath7 are defined as _ utility _ functions , and various expressions have been proposed for them .",
    "see kelly  @xcite , massouli  @xcite and massouli and roberts  @xcite . with this representation , the tcp protocol is seen as an adaptive algorithm maximizing some criterion at the level of the network .",
    "a different point of view has been proposed in graham and robert  @xcite .",
    "it starts on the local dynamics of the aimd algorithm used by tcp and , through a scaling procedure , the global behavior of the network can then be described rigorously .",
    "it is assumed that there are @xmath0 classes of _ permanent _ connections going through different nodes and with different characteristics .",
    "the loss rate of a connection using a given node @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is described as a function of the congestion @xmath10 at this node .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is defined as the ( possibly weighted ) sum of the throughputs of _ all _ the connections that use node @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction of the connections in the network is therefore expressed via the loss rate at each node .",
    "it has been shown in graham and robert  @xcite that under a mean - field scaling , the evolution of a class @xmath11 connection , @xmath12 , can be asymptotically described as the unique solution of an unusual stochastic differential equation .",
    "furthermore , it has also been proved that the equilibrium distribution of the throughputs of the different classes of connections is in a one to one correspondence with the solution of a fixed point equation @xmath13 of dimension @xmath14 ( the number of nodes ) .    under `` reasonable '' conditions",
    ", there should be only one solution of @xmath13 and consequently a unique stable equilibrium of the network .",
    "otherwise this would imply that the state of the network could oscillate between several stable states .",
    "although this is mentioned here and there in the literature , this has not been firmly established in the context of an ip network .",
    "it has been shown that multi - stability may occur in loss networks , see gibbens  @xcite and marbukh  @xcite or in the context of a wireless network with admission control , see antunes  @xcite .",
    "raghunathan and kumar  @xcite presents experiments that suggest that a phenomenon of bi - stability may occur in a context similar to the one considered in this paper but for wireless networks .",
    "it turns out that it is not easy to check in practice whether the fixed point equation @xmath13 has a unique solution or not .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail this question for several topologies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ secone ] reviews the main definitions and results used in the paper .",
    "in addition , a simple criterion for the existence of a fixed - point solution is given .",
    "section  [ sectree ] presents a uniqueness result for a tree topology under the assumptions that all connections use the root .",
    "section  [ seclinear ] considers a linear network .",
    "section  [ torus ] studies several scenarios for ring topologies and a uniqueness result is proved for connections going through one , two , or all the nodes . two main approaches are used to prove uniqueness : monotonicity properties of the network and contraction arguments .",
    "a general conjecture that we make is that when the loss rates are increasing in the level of congestion , this should be sufficient to imply the uniqueness of the equilibrium in a general network ( together with regularity properties perhaps ) .",
    "in this section , a somewhat simplified version of the stochastic model of interacting tcp flows of graham and robert  @xcite is presented .",
    "ott  @xcite presents a fluid model of a single connection . via scalings with respect to the loss rate , dumas",
    "@xcite proves various limit theorems for the resulting processes .",
    "the limiting picture of dumas  @xcite for the evolution of the throughput of single long connection is as follows .",
    "if the instantaneous throughput at time @xmath15 of the connection is @xmath16 , this process has the markov property and its infinitesimal generator is given by @xmath17 for @xmath18 a @xmath19-function from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath22 , the quantity @xmath16 should be thought as the instantaneous throughput of the connection at time @xmath15 .",
    "the markov process @xmath23 increases linearly at rate @xmath24 .",
    "the constant @xmath24 is related to the distance between the source and the destination .",
    "it increases proportionally to the round trip time @xmath25 , typically @xmath26 for some constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "given @xmath29 , the process @xmath23 jumps from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is usually @xmath33 ) at rate @xmath34 .",
    "the expression @xmath34 represents the loss rate of the connection .",
    "of course , the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath35 and @xmath32 depend on the parameters of the connection .",
    "the density of the invariant distribution of this markov process is given in the following proposition .",
    "it has been analyzed in ott  @xcite at the fluid level and by dumas  @xcite , see also guillemin  @xcite .",
    "the transient behavior has been investigated in chafai  @xcite .",
    "[ oneprop ] the function @xmath36 with @xmath37 , is the density of the invariant distribution of the markov process @xmath23 whose infinitesimal generator is given by equation  .",
    "furthermore , its expected value is given by @xmath38      the network has @xmath39 nodes and accommodates @xmath40 classes of permanent connections . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the number of class @xmath11 connections is @xmath41 , and one sets @xmath42 an _ allocation matrix _",
    "@xmath43 with positive coefficients describes the use of nodes by the connections .",
    "in particular the route of a class  @xmath11 connection goes through node @xmath8 only if @xmath44 . in practice ,",
    "the class of a connection is determined by the sequence set of nodes it is using .    if @xmath45 is the throughput of the @xmath46th class @xmath11 connection , @xmath47 , the quantity @xmath48 is the weighted throughput at node @xmath8 of this connection .",
    "a simple example would be to take @xmath49 or @xmath50 depending on whether a class  @xmath11 connection uses node @xmath8 or not .",
    "the total weighted throughput @xmath10 of node @xmath8 by the various connections is given by @xmath51 the quantity @xmath10 represents the level of utilization / congestion of node @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the loss rate of a connection going through node  @xmath8 will depend on this variable .    for @xmath12 ,",
    "the corresponding parameters @xmath24 and @xmath35 of equation   for a class @xmath11 connection are given by a non - negative number @xmath52 and a function @xmath53 , so that when the resource vector of the network is @xmath54 and if the state of a class @xmath11 connection is @xmath55 :    * its state increases linearly at rate @xmath52 .",
    "for example @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the round trip time between the source and the destination of a class @xmath11 connection . *",
    "a loss for this connection occurs at rate @xmath58 and in this case its state jumps from @xmath55 to @xmath59 .",
    "the function @xmath60 depends only on the utilization of all nodes used by class @xmath11 connections .",
    "in particular , if a class @xmath11 connection goes through the nodes @xmath61 , @xmath62 ,  , @xmath63 , one has @xmath64 a more specific ( and natural ) choice for @xmath60 would be @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the loss rate at node @xmath67 when its congestion level is @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the loss rate in a non - congested network .",
    "another example is when the loss rate @xmath60 depends only on the sum of the utilizations of the nodes used by class  @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath70      if @xmath71 denotes the throughput of the @xmath46th class @xmath11 connection , @xmath72 , then the vector @xmath73 , t\\geq 0)\\ ] ] has the markov property .",
    "as it stands , this markov process is quite difficult to analyze . for this reason , a mean field scaling",
    "is used to get a more quantitative representation of the interaction of the flows .",
    "more specifically , it is assumed that the total number of connections @xmath74 goes to infinity and that the total number of class @xmath11 connections is of the order @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .    for each @xmath12 ,",
    "one takes a class @xmath11 connection at random , let @xmath77 be its index , @xmath78 .",
    "the process @xmath79 represents the throughput of a `` typical '' class @xmath11 connection .",

    "because of the role of the deterministic function @xmath90 in these equations , the markov property holds for this process but it is not _ time - homogeneous_. the analogue of the infinitesimal generator @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 the homogeneity holds when the function @xmath93 is equal to a constant @xmath94 , which will be the case at equilibrium",
    ". in this case a class @xmath11 connection behaves like a single isolated connection with parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the following theorem gives a characterization of the invariant distributions for the process @xmath97 .",
    "[ thinv ] the invariant distributions for solutions @xmath97 of equation   are in one - to - one correspondence with the solutions @xmath98 of the fixed point equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 if @xmath94 is such a solution , the corresponding invariant distribution has the density @xmath101 on @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 is defined in proposition  [ oneprop ] .",
    "the above theorem shows that if the fixed point equation   has several solutions , then the limiting process @xmath97 has several invariant distributions .",
    "similarly , if equation   has no solution then , in particular , @xmath97 can not converge to an equilibrium .",
    "these possibilities have been suggested in the internet literature through simulations , like the cyclic behavior of some nodes in the case of congestion .    under mild and natural assumptions , such as the loss rate being non - decreasing with respect to the utilization in the nodes ,",
    "we show that for some specific topologies there exists a unique fixed point .",
