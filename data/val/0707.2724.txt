    "hera is an electron - proton ( @xmath0 ) collider operating in desy in hamburg , germany . at hera ,",
    "electrons of energy @xmath1 gev collide with protons of energy @xmath2 or @xmath3 gev , corresponding to a center - of - mass energy of @xmath4 or @xmath5 gev , respectively .    in autumn 2003",
    "the hera accelerator started operation of the second phase of its @xmath0 collider programme , so called hera ii .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 data collected by the h1 and zeus experiments since then were taken with a longitudinally polarized positron beam for the first time . at hera transverse polarization of the positron beam arises naturally through synchrotron radiation via the sokolov - ternov effect  @xcite . in 2000 a pair of spin rotators",
    "was installed in the beamline on either side of the h1 detector , allowing transversely polarized positrons to be rotated into longitudinally polarized states and back again .",
    "the degree of polarization is constant around the hera ring and is continuously measured using two independent polarimeters  @xcite .",
    "h1 and zeus collaborations are colliding experiments located at hera .",
    "both have big , almost full - coverage detectors located at hera interactions points .",
    "a detailed description of the detectors can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "hera is a multipurpose machine but it is mainly ideally suited for detailed studies of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and for testing new qcd predictions .",
    "the hera experiments extended the kinematic range by more than two orders of magnitude in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to that accessible to the earlier , fixed target experiments and have a common phase - space with the future lhc accelerator .",
    "this review presents only a subjective selection of the very broad spectrum of results delivered by the h1 and zeus experiments at the hera collider .",
    "for the neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) reaction , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , the four - momentum transfer can be calculated as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the incident and the scattered lepton four - momentum , respectively .",
    "the fraction @xmath8 of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark is @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting the proton four - momentum .",
    "the inelasticity is @xmath17 and @xmath18 measures the energy of the hadronic system .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) predicts that the cross sections for charged and neutral current @xmath0 dis should exhibit specific dependencies on the longitudinal polarization of the incoming lepton beam .",
    "the absence of right - handed charged currents leads to the prediction that the cc cross section will be a linear function of polarization , vanishing for right - handed ( left - handed ) electron ( positron ) beams .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have measured the nc and cc dis cross sections ( total , differential and double differential ) for electron and positron beams with positive and negative polarizations and compared results with the sm predictions  @xcite . at large @xmath9",
    "the structure function @xmath19 , which provides information on valence quark distributions , can be measured by subtracting the nc cross sections of electron - proton and positron - proton dis .",
    "both collaboration have extended the previous @xmath19 measurements  @xcite using the hera ii data .",
    "a reduction of statistical error of these measurements is due mainly to much increased electron sample .",
    "the measurements of the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations are in good agreement .",
    "the expectation of the sm , evaluated with the h1 pdf 2000 and cteq6d pdf for h1 and zeus measurement , respectively , gives a good description of the data .",
    "[ cc - nc ] on the left shows cc dis cross sections for electron and positron beams as measured by h1 and zeus experiments as a function of polarization . there is a clear linear dependence of the cc dis cross section as a function of polarization .",
    "the cc cross section is consistent with zero for right - handed ( left - handed ) electron ( positron ) beams .",
    "the results are compared to the sm predictions and they agree well .",
    "[ cc - nc ] on the right shows the @xmath9 dependence of the combined @xmath0 left- and right - handed nc cross section ratio r , measured by the h1 experiment , compared to the sm prediction .",

    "fit  @xcite , zeus nc @xmath6 dis inclusive jet cross sections  @xcite and direct photoproduction dijet cross sections  @xcite have been used to constrain the gluon .",
    "these jet data together with zeus data on nc and cc @xmath6 and @xmath7 dis inclusive cross sections were used as inputs to an next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd dglap analysis in order to determine the pdfs within a single experiment .",
    "the predictions for the jet cross sections are calculated to nlo in qcd and are used in the fit rigorously , rather than approximately as in previous fits  @xcite .",

    "it can be seen very clearly that the new polarized data make a significant impact on the estimation of the weak nc vector couplings in the light quark sector .",
    "the study of hard diffraction processes at hera offers an important insight on the diffraction and the pomeron structures .",
    "hard diffractive processes ( inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , jet production and production of charmed quarks ) can be well described by factorizing the cross section into a pomeron flux and a hard qcd scattering process with a parton in the pomeron which is described by diffractive parton densities ( dpdf ) .",
    "diffractive parton densities have been determined in dglap qcd analysis using inclusive diffractive hera data  @xcite and have been found to be dominated by the gluon distribution .",
    "diffractive dijet production is directly sensitive to the gluon component of the diffractive exchange and for dis  @xcite is in reasonable agreement with the qcd fits to the inclusive diffractive data .",
    "the h1 collaboration has performed a new measurement of diffractive dijet cross sections in dis  @xcite with the integrated luminosity increased by a factor 5 with respect to previous results  @xcite .",
    "the diffractive quark and gluon distributions have been determined from a combined nlo qcd fit performed by the h1 collaboration to the differential dijet cross sections and the inclusive diffractive structure function @xmath39  @xcite .",
