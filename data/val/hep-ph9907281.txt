    "several years ago , mclerran and venugopalan  @xcite recognized the existence of a regime in which the gluon structure functions ought to be calculable within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "their idea is to recognize that in large nuclei at small enough values of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 , the density of partons per unit area is large .",
    "since a large number of charges are contributing , it is expected that classical methods should apply , _",
    "i.e. _  the vector potential is computed from the classical yang - mills equations , and quantum correlation functions are approximated by ensemble averages .",
    "this picture was developed more fully in subsequent work  @xcite , and is somewhat related to the approach of mueller  @xcite .    in the region of",
    "very small @xmath1 , the quantum corrections to the distribution functions calculated in the mclerran - venugopalan model become large  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these corrections are enhanced by powers of @xmath2 , implying that the classical approximation being made at lowest order is breaking down in this region .",
    "this observation has lead to the development of a renormalization group procedure  @xcite whereby these corrections are taken into account by incorporating gluons with large values of @xmath1 into the charge density .",
    "this approach , which uses the results of the mclerran - venugopalan model as its input , has been subsequently developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is not on the very small @xmath1 region , but rather on dealing with the infrared divergence in the transverse coordinates which appears in the mclerran - venugopalan model .",
    "the vector potential two - point correlation functions obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are highly infrared divergent , going like @xmath3 at large distances . on one hand , the region where this poor behavior manifests itself",
    "is confined to separations @xmath4 .",
    "this is firmly in the non - perturbative regime where one does not really believe the results of a perturbative calculation anyway .",
    "however , since the gluon number density is derived from the fourier transform of this correlation function , the presence of such a strong divergence makes it difficult to obtain more than qualitative results from the theory : one must resort to cutting off the transverse spatial integrations at @xmath5@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will demonstrate that the infrared divergence described above is closely related to the issue of color neutrality .",
    "physically , nucleons appear to be colorless when viewed at length scales which greatly exceed @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , we expect that two - point correlation functions should die off rapidly beyond distance scales of about @xmath5 , because of confinement .",
    "the quarks in two widely separated nucleons should not feel each others presence .",
    "thus , the fundamental requirement that the nucleons be color neutral may be rephrased as a restriction on the allowable charge - density correlation functions @xmath6 .",
    "although the mclerran - venugopalan model employs an ensemble of charge distributions which respects the fact that the average charge should vanish , the two - point correlator computed from this ensemble is inconsistent with color - neutral nucleons .",
    "we claim that the color neutrality condition should be viewed as of primary importance , and that we should modify the ensemble of charge distributions to satisfy it . by doing so",
    ", we incorporate one of the major effects brought about by confinement , parameterizing it in terms of the precise form chosen for @xmath6 .",
    "enforcing color neutrality cures the infrared divergence in the mclerran - venugopalan model by introducing a new scale into the problem , namely the minimum length scale for which color neutrality holds .",
    "this outcome is somewhat similar to the one considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , neither of these papers examine the consequences of enforcing color neutrality in great detail .    given a model which incorporates the color neutrality of the nucleons at some scale , we obtain infrared finite correlation functions . because our results are well - defined everywhere , we are able to draw firm conclusions about various properties of the gluon distribution functions , in spite of their highly nonlinear form .",
    "we are able to demonstrate that the gluon distribution functions in the mclerran - venugopalan model are proportional to @xmath0 , independent of the distribution of charge in the longitudinal coordinate . to evade this conclusion apparently requires charge - density correlation functions which have a non - trivial longitudinal structure .",
    "although we have modified the form of @xmath6 from the one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we still obtain correlation functions which are consistent with asymptotic freedom . that is , in the ultraviolet limit , the non - abelian terms drop out and we obtain a gluon distribution function which goes like @xmath7 . at small values of the transverse momentum @xmath8 , our gluon distribution functions either approach a finite constant or diverge mildly ( like @xmath9 ) , depending on the long distance behavior of @xmath6 .",
    "the density of gluons at small @xmath8 grows more slowly with increasing nuclear size than the number of nucleons , consistent with saturation  @xcite .",
    "we also derive a transverse momentum sum rule , which shows that the non - abelian corrections only serve to transfer gluons ( at fixed @xmath1 ) from one value of transverse momentum to another : the total number of gluons is not altered .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the structure functions we obtain are simply proportional to the number of nucleons : all non - linear dependence on the amount of charge present is suppressed at large values of the momentum transfer . as an application of the sum rule ,",
    "we make contact with the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi equation  @xcite , demonstrating the plausibility of the mclerran - venugopalan model .",
    "in addition , we are able to compute a fairly simple expression for the mean transverse momentum - squared of the gluons which is accurate to order unity : that is , the logarithms that arise in our calculation are all evaluated at a scale which is completely calculable given a nucleon model .",
    "we find that the leading @xmath10 behavior of this quantity is linear in the number of nucleons , whereas the logarithmic corrections are quadratic in the charge per unit transverse area .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "if the charge - density correlator is gaussian and local in the longitudinal coordinate , we show that the gluon number density is always proportional to @xmath0 .",

    "the details of how to evaluate various integrals arising in the text are contained in appendices  [ sigma ] ,  [ moments ] , and  [ integ1 ] .",
    "the goal of the mclerran - venugopalan ( ) model is to compute the gluon distribution function at small values of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 for a very large nucleus .",
    "we begin our discussion with the assumptions which form the basis of the  model , and outline the steps in the computation of the gluon distribution function .",
    "having described the ingredients which underlie the calculations , we will explain the conditions which are required for this picture to be applicable .",
    "consider a nucleus moving along the @xmath12 axis at nearly the speed of light .",
    "the central assertion of the  model is that , in a specific kinematic regime , we may determine the gluon distribution function of the nucleus as follows .",
    "first , we are told to compute the classical vector potential generated by the valence quarks . since the valence quarks appear as a lorentz - contracted pancake - shaped distribution of color charge , the current appearing in the classical yang - mills equations takes the form ( see appendix  [ notation ] for a summary of our notation and conventions ) j^+(x ) & = & ( x^- , ) , j^-(x ) & = & 0 ,",

    "( [ qcdcurrent ] ) in the limit that the source ( _ i.e. _  the nucleus ) is moving at the speed of light . because the intuitive parton model is realized in the light - cone gauge  @xcite , we should write the solution in that gauge , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath14 .    by definition ,",
    "the gluon number density is just the gluon number operator evaluated in the ( quantum ) state of interest .",
    "this may be expressed in terms of the two - point vector potential correlation function as  @xcite = q^+ _",
    "-^ dx^- d^2_-^ dx^- d^2e^-iq^+(x^--x^- ) e^i(- ) .",
    "[ gluondensity ] in the  model , the average over quantum fluctuations implied by the angled brackets on the right hand side of  ( [ gluondensity ] ) is replaced by a classical average over a suitably weighted ensemble of charge densities .",
    "the ensemble should consist of all of the physically realizable states of the quarks ( in color singlet combinations ) within the nucleons and of the nucleons within the nucleus .",
    "then , what we require is an expression for the vector potential in terms of the charge density plus the probability distribution for determining how likely a given charge configuation is . in the  model ,",
    "ensemble averages are computed according to the gaussian weight \\ { - dx^-d^2dx^- d^2 ^-1(- ) } .",
    "[ rhoweight ] this weight implies that the charge density has an average value of zero .",
    "there are , however , fluctuations about this average value , the size of which are governed by @xmath15 , which is related to the average charge density squared per unit area per unit thickness . with what they call the space - time rapidity @xmath16 , defined by @xmath17 .",
    "thus , they write @xmath18 and refer to it as the average charge density squared per unit area per unit rapidity .",
    "we will stick to the description in terms of @xmath19 in this paper . ]",
    "the precise statement of the relationship appears in sec .",
    "[ neutrality ] .",
    "the longitudinal dependence of eq .",
    "( [ rhoweight ] ) is purely local in @xmath19 , reflecting the fact that the large number of quarks which contribute to the charge per unit area at a given transverse position typically come from different nucleons : hence , they should be uncorrelated .",
    "the transverse space dependence of the  model as described in refs .",
    "@xcite is ( - ) = ^2(- ) .",
    "[ mvtrans ] ultimately , we intend to modify this dependence .",
    "therefore , we will write our expressions in terms of @xmath20 and insert  ( [ mvtrans ] ) only when we wish to specifically discuss the results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus , given the solution for the vector potential in terms of the charge density and an ansatz for the charge density correlation function , we may compute an approximation to the gluon distribution function .",
    "we now describe the conditions necessary for this procedure to yield a good approximation to the result which would be obtained in a full qcd treatment .",
    "first , we note that the charge distribution for the nucleus is taken to be a lorentz - contracted pancake moving along the @xmath12 axis at ( nearly ) the speed of light .",
    "we wish to be in the regime where the partons do not resolve its longitudinal structure .",
    "this is only true for partons with very small longitudinal momentum fractions . to determine how small the momentum should be , we note that the corresponding length scale @xmath21 should be larger than the thickness of the lorentz - contracted nucleus .",
    "this thickness is of order @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of nucleons , @xmath24 the radius of a single nucleon , and @xmath25 is the ( common ) boost factor of the nucleons which comprise the nucleus . writing the mass of the nucleon to be @xmath26 , we see then that the condition on the momentum fraction reads .",
    "[ xcondition ] gluons with longitudinal momenta satisfying  ( [ xcondition ] ) can not resolve distances shorter than the thickness of the lorentz - contracted nucleus they see .",
    "an immediate consequence of being unable to resolve nucleons with different values of @xmath19 is that we may view the nucleons as being piled up onto effectively the same value of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , each unit of transverse area will , on average , contain a large number of valence quarks .",
    "since there are a large number of quarks contributing , the total contribution will be in a large representation of the gauge group , allowing us to treat the source in the the classical approximation .",
    "the large number of quarks also allows us to justify the use of the gaussian weight  ( [ rhoweight ] ) via the central limit theorem .",
    "the number of valence quarks per unit area in a flattened nucleus of radius @xmath27 is @xmath28 , since the nuclear radius scales with the number of nucleons as @xmath29 .",
    "gluons with a transverse momentum @xmath30 see a transverse area of about @xmath31 . thus , to maintain the condition that there is a large number of quarks in the region being probed",
    ", we should only look at transverse momenta such that ^2 ^2 3 a^1/3 a^-2 , [ qtcondition ] that is , @xmath8 should be soft enough to correspond to a large enough area , but not so soft that the coupling becomes strong .",
    "a second factor limiting the maximum @xmath30 for which this treatment is valid is the observation that if the transverse momentum of the emitted gluons is too large , then the eikonal approximation we are making breaks down .",
    "that is , the no - recoil approximation that allowed us to treat the valence quarks as being localized on the light - cone fails .",
    "the bottom line is that in large enough nuclei for small enough values of the longitudinal momentum carried by the parton and moderately large tranverse momenta , the number of quarks per unit area becomes large . in this regime",
    ", we expect that we may compute the gluon distribution function at lowest order from the classical solution to the yang - mills equations .",
    "as outlined above , the model makes use of the classical solution to the yang - mills equations in the presence of a source of the form  ( [ qcdcurrent ] ) , with @xmath32 the only nonzero component , independent of the light - cone time @xmath13 .",
    "ultimately , we will take the dependence on the light - cone distance @xmath19 to be a delta function , corresponding to the pancake - shaped distribution described above .",
    "initially , however , we will work with a finite spread in @xmath19 ( a multi - layer pancake ) , to avoid the ambiguities that would otherwise arise in the commutator terms of the yang - mills equations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , certain quantum corrections may be included by a renormalization group treatment  @xcite which generates a specific @xmath19 dependence , reflecting the presence of the yukawa cloud of quark pairs and gluons around the original source .",
    "so , it behooves us to make provision for such a dependence .",
    "the simplest route to the solution for the vector potential in the light - cone gauge for a current of the form  ( [ qcdcurrent ] ) is to begin by finding the solution in the covariant gauge , and subsequently transform into the light - cone gauge  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we begin in the covariant gauge , @xmath33 , where the field equations  ( [ yangmills ] ) become ^2^ -2i ^,_^ + i _ , ^^ - _ , ^ , ^ = j^. we recall that in electrodynamics , the @xmath34th component of the vector potential is generated by the @xmath34th component of the current ( in the covariant gauge ) .",
