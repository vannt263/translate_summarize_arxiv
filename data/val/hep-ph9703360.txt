    "in higher order qcd calculations at lep the effects of quark masses are always screened by the ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the quark and @xmath3 is the center of mass energy . at lep , even for the heaviest produced quark , the bottom quark , we have @xmath4 and , therefore , for inclusive observables , such as total hadronic cross section , or the decay width of @xmath5 , the mass effects are almost negligible .",
    "the situation is different for more exclusive observables .",
    "it has been stressed  @xcite that quark mass effects could be enhanced in jet production cross sections . in this case observables depend also on a new variable , @xmath6 , the jet - resolution parameter that defines the multiplicity of the jets .",
    "in fact , these effects have already been seen  @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been shown in  @xcite that second - order qcd predictions are necessary in order to perform a meaningful comparison of the theory with experimental results and to possibly extract the value of the quark mass from such measurements .    in previous papers  @xcite",
    "we have presented the results of the calculation of some three - jet fractions at lep including next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections and keeping the full dependence on the @xmath7-quark mass . in this paper",
    "we focus on several technical details that appear in the calculation .",
    "our results for some ir divergent integrals with massive quarks are new and could be used in many other calculations of this type .",
    "the main difficulty of the nlo calculation is the appearance , in addition to ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences , of infrared ( ir ) singularities because gluons are massless .",
    "the bloch - nordsieck ( bn ) and kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorems  @xcite assure that jet cross - sections are infrared finite and free from collinear divergences .",
    "the ir singularities of the nlo one - loop feynman diagrams cancel against the ir divergences that appear when the differential cross - section for four - parton production is integrated over the region of phase - space where either one gluon is soft or two gluons are collinear . nevertheless , infrared and collinear divergences appear in intermediate steps and should be treated properly .",
    "we used dimensional regularization to regularize both uv and ir divergences  @xcite because it preserves the qcd ward identities .    for massive quarks ,",
    "the gluon - quark collinear singularities , that appear in the massless case , are softened into logarithms of the quark mass .",
    "the number of ir singularities is , therefore , smaller .",
    "however , quark masses complicate extremely the loop and phase - space integrals .",
    "in particular , diagrams containing gluon - gluon collinear divergences are much harder to calculate than in the massless case .",
    "furthermore , infrared singularities appear always at the border of the integration region . for virtual contributions , at the border of the one unit side box defined by the feynman parameters . for contributions coming from the emission of real gluons , at the border of the phase - space .",
    "thus , any simplification is impossible , the full calculation has to be performed in arbitrary @xmath8 dimensions and expansions for @xmath9 are allowed only at the end .",
    "several methods of analytical cancellation of infrared singularities have been developed in the past .",
    "the most popular are the _ phase - space slicing method",
    "_  @xcite and the _ subtraction method _  @xcite .",
    "we work in the context of the so - called phase - space slicing method . in this case the analytical integration over a thin slice at the border of the phase - space is performed in @xmath10-dimensions and the result is added to the virtual corrections .",
    "the integration over the rest of the phase - space , which is finite , is done numerically for @xmath11 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "se : virtual ] we consider the most complicated , ir divergent one - loop box integrals that appear in the calculation of the three - jet decay rate of the @xmath0-boson into massive quarks at nlo .",
    "we start this section by presenting the calculation of some simpler three - point scalar integrals , which control the ir structure of the box diagrams .",
    "one of the box integrals involves the three - gluon vertex and was only known in the case of massless quarks  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated it also for the massive case by using dimensional regularization .",
    "this is one of the main contributions of this paper .",
    "section [ se : real ] is devoted to the calculation of the basic phase - space integrals of the @xmath0-decay into four partons wich lead to ir ( collinear ) divergent contributions to the three - jet fractions .",
    "we used the phase - space slicing method .",
    "when one of the gluons is soft , the calculation is performed by imposing a theoretical cut on the energy of the gluon , @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13-cut should be small enough to allow for expansions for small @xmath13 in the analytical calculations and should not interfere with the experimental cuts . on the other hand , it should be large enough to avoid instabilities in the numerical integrations .",
    "for the transition amplitudes containing gluon - gluon collinear divergences we perform the cut on @xmath14 , the scalar product of the momenta of the two gluons normalized to the center of mass energy .",
    "these contributions have to cancel exactly the appropriate infrared poles of the virtual contributions .",
    "we show explicitly how these basic integrals share the same infrared behavior as the one - loop scalar functions considered in section [ se : virtual ] .",
    "finally , in appendices [ ap : hyper ] and [ ap : ps ] , we collect some properties of the hypergeometric functions and the formulae that define the three- and the four - body phase - space in arbitrary space - time @xmath10-dimensions .    throughout all this paper we work with the following set of dimensionless lorentz - invariant variables y_ij = 2(p_ip_j)/s , r_b= m_b^2/s , where the @xmath15 are the scalar product of all the possible pairs of final state momenta normalized to @xmath16 , the total center of mass energy , @xmath17 is the mass of the quark / antiquark ( in particular the @xmath7-quark mass ) and particles labeled as 3 and 4 represent the gluons , @xmath18 .",
    "energy - momentum conservation imposes the following restrictions y_12 & = & 1 - 2r_b - y_13-y_23 , + y_12 & = & 1 - 2r_b - y_13-y_14-y_23-y_24-y_34 . in the case of the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "we consider here the ir divergent virtual corrections to the three - parton decay @xmath21 with all external particles on - shell , see fig  [ dloop ] .    using the passarino - veltman  @xcite procedure we can reduce any set of vectorial or tensorial one - loop integrals to n - point scalar functions",
    ". therefore only scalar integrals  @xcite have to be computed . at the nlo the relevant one - loop feynman diagrams contribute only through their interference with the lowest order born amplitudes .",
    "therefore , we will be interested only in the real part of such n - point scalar one - loop integrals . although we will not specify it , the following results refer , in almost all cases , just to the real part of these functions",
    ".      first we present results for the two three - point functions which actually define the non - trivial ir structure of the whole virtual radiative corrections for the process .",
    "as we will show below , the ir poles of the four - point functions contributing to our process are also controlled by these simpler three - point functions .",
    "thus , we have to consider the following scalar one loop integrals , see fig  [ cloop ] , & & c03(y_13 ) = ^4-d + & &  , and & & c05(y_12 ) = ^4-d + & &  . in general , this kind of functions depend on all the masses in the propagators , on the square of the difference of the two external momenta and on the square of the external momenta itself . since we have fixed the mass and we have imposed the on - shell condition the only remaining relevant arguments of these functions are the two - momenta invariants @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "for the @xmath24 function , which has a double ir pole , the most convenient feynman parametrization is the one with both feynman parameters running from @xmath25 to @xmath26 because then the two integrations decouple . after performing the integration over the loop momenta we have & & c03(y_13 ) = - s^-1- ^2 ( 4)^ ( 1 + ) _ 0 ^ 1 x^-1 - 2 dx + & & _ 0 ^ 1 ^-1- dy  .",
    "we see from here that , as we mentioned , the infrared problem is at the border of the feynman parameter space , in this particular case at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the full calculation has to be performed for arbitrary @xmath29 values .",
    "we will omit the @xmath30 term in the following calculations , however , when needed , we will use the prescription @xmath31 , @xmath32 to resolve the ambiguities .",
