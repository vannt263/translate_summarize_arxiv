    "if so , the paucity of precursors could be an observational selection effect .",
    "furthermore , the transition to the proposed suspended accretion state should be prompt , at the point when hyper - accretion drops below the @xcite critical value for hyper - accretion along the proposed modified bardeen trajectory . below this critical value ,",
    "feedback from the black hole sets in , bringing hyper - accretion to a halt leaving an essentially poynting flux dominated torus magnetosphere around the black hole @xcite . at this point",

    "a direct observation on the activity of the inner engine in cc - sne by gravitational wave emissions promises to identify the detailed activity and transient behavior of the inner engine by identification of specific gravitational wave features , in temporal behavior and gravitational wave spectra . for the ns - ns and ns - bh mergers , it would be interesting to identify them by different black hole masses and spins , otherwise difficult to pursue by existing electromagnetic observations .",

    "<S> long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) associated with supernovae and short grbs with extended emission ( sgrbee ) from mergers are probably powered by black holes as a common inner engine , as their prompt grb emission satisfies the same amati correlation in the @xmath0 plane . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce modified bardeen equations to identify hyper - accretion driving newly formed black holes in core - collapse supernovae to near - extremal spin as a precursor to prompt grb emission . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent spin - down is observed in the batse catalog of long grbs . </S>",
    "<S> spin - down provides a natural unification of long durations associated with the lifetime of black hole spin for normal long grbs and sgrbees , given the absence of major fallback matter in mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the results point to major emissions unseen in high frequency gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> a novel matched filtering method is described for ligo - virgo and kagra broadband probes of nearby core - collapse supernovae at essentially maximal sensitivity . </S>"
