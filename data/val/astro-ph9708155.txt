    "the searches for gravitational microlensing events in the galactic bulge and in the magellanic clouds have matured , and frequent alerts of new events are provided in real time ( cf .",
    "paczyski 1996a for a review ) .",
    "unfortunately , currently there is no way to firmly determine the distance to a lensing object and to measure its mass because a number of physical parameters combine into a single observable quantity : the time scale @xmath5 . in some cases",
    "the degeneracy may be partly broken , as reviewed by gould ( 1996 ) .",
    "also , at least one suggestion was made how to remove the degeneracy altogether in some rare cases ( extreme microlensing : gould 1997 ) .",
    "h@xmath6 g , novikov & polnarev ( 1995 ) , miyamoto & yoshi ( 1995 ) , and walker ( 1995 ) pointed out that accurate astrometry could permit the determination of the distance and the mass of a macho .",
    "it seems that the space interferometry mission ( sim ) is the first specific instrument which will have the capability adequate for this task .",
    "according to the mission specification , it will have an angular resolution of @xmath7 mas , and positional accuracy down to @xmath3 micro - arcsecond , for stars as faint as 20 mag . a complete description of the technical details as well as the scientific program were published by allen , shao , & peterson ( 1997 ) , and",
    "can also be found on the world wide web at :    _ http://huey / jpl.nasa.gov / sim/ _    some of the topics covered in this letter ( section 3 ) are presented in much more details in the paper written by three members of the sim team : boden , shao , & van buren ( 1997 ) .",
    "recently , a somewhat related aspects of gravitational lensing astrometry were considered by miralda - escud ( 1996 ) and paczyski ( 1996b ) , who in particular pointed out that astrometric cross section is much larger than photometric cross section .",
    "therefore , the masses of single high proper motion stars and brown dwarfs can be determined accurately by measuring the astrometric lensing effects of the distant stars .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present in one place various suggestions made in the past for the application of @xmath3 micro - arcsecond astrometry to determine the masses of stars , brown dwarfs , and machos , whatever the machos might be .",
    "in addition , a new suggestion to use such astrometry to measure stellar radii and effective temperatures is also presented .",
    "typical angular separations of multiple images formed by microlensing within our galaxy or towards the magellanic clouds are @xmath3 mas ( paczyski 1996a , and references therein ) , so they will remain unresolved by the sim . however , the centroid of the combined image is expected to move around by @xmath3 mas , and this motion can be readily measured by the sim with a very high precision .",
    "the angular einstein ring radius of a point lens is given as @xmath8 ^{1/2 } =   0.902 ~ { \\rm mas } ~ \\left ( { m \\over m_{\\odot } } \\right ) ^{1/2 } \\left [ 10 ~ { \\rm kpc } \\times \\left ( { 1 \\over d_d }    - { 1 \\over d_s } \\right ) \\right ] ^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the distances to the source and the lens ( deflector ) , and the lens mass , respectively . the time scale of the event is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the proper motion of the lens relative to the lensed star ( note that the macho collaboration uses @xmath14 for the time scale ) .    in the simplest case the relative motion of the lens and the source is linear , with the angular impact parameter @xmath15 .",
    "superposed on this is the relative parallactic motion with the angular amplitude @xmath16 ( in radians ) : @xmath17 where the astronomical unit ( au ) is the radius of earth s orbit . the equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 )",
    "may be combined to obtain the lens mass : @xmath18 where the einstein ring radius and the relative parallax of the lens with respect to the source are expressed in milli - arcseconds .",
    "the two micro images formed by the lens can not be resolved , but the light centroid is displaced with respect to the source position by the angle ( cf .",
    "g , novikov & polnarev 1995 , miyamoto & yoshi 1995 , walker 1995 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the source and the lens , and the lens is assumed to be dark .",
    "the maximum displacement is @xmath21    for @xmath22 the light centroid corresponds almost exactly to the position of the dominant image ( cf .",
    "paczyski 1996b ) .",
    "note , that if the lensing star is invisible , as assumed , then the source position can be measured with respect to any nearby star .",
    "in this section we present a few examples of the displacement trajectories to illustrate the principle of the phenomenon , and to demonstrate that the lens mass and parallax have distinct effects which should be readily measurable with the sim .",
    "let us consider a microlensing event with a time scale @xmath23 50 days and maximum magnification @xmath24 , which corresponds to the impact parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt the source distance to be @xmath26 kpc , and consider three different cases of the lens distance : 10 , 30 , and 45 kpc , with identical lens mass of @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding einstein ring radii are @xmath28 mas , respectively . finally , the relative proper motion is @xmath29 , for these three cases .",
    "for our example we adopt @xmath30 , which is reasonable for a star in the lmc , and we arbitrarily take @xmath31 , where ( @xmath32 ) are the ecliptic longitude and latitude , respectively .",
    "the relative parallax is equal @xmath33 mas for the three cases , respectively . finally , we chose the maximum magnification and the smallest angular separation between the lens and the source to be at the time when the star is at the largest angular separation from the sun .",
    "the three examples of astrometric effects of microlensing a star in the lmc are presented in figure 1 , which shows the relation between the displacements in the two ecliptic coordinates , ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "all lines in fig.1 begin 18 months before the maximum of photometric magnification , and they end 18 months after that maximum . both ends are close to @xmath34 .",
    "the largest curve corresponds to the lens distance @xmath35 kpc , the smallest to @xmath36 kpc .",
    "note , that the largest displacement is proportional to the einstein ring radius , with @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "the relative proper motion of the lens with respect to the star is given as the ratio : @xmath38 .",
    "the determination of the relative parallax requires model fitting , but this should be feasible . the dashed curve in figure 1 shows the displacement of the image centroid for the case when the lens is at @xmath35 kpc , but the earth orbital motion is artificially suppressed .",
    "the difference between the solid and the dashed lines is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this is the complicated effect of the earth motion , and its scale is such that the sim should be able to measure it readily .",
    "therefore , if the machos responsible for microlensing of the lmc stars are located in the galactic halo then their distances and masses will be determined with the sim astrometry .",
    "the masses and distances to the galactic bulge lenses will be even easier to measure as their parallaxes are relatively large .",
    "note , that @xmath39 astrometry will provide accurate astrometric determination of the macho mass , as shown with the scale of the figure 2 , however , a much lower precision of the roemer mission ( cf .",
    "g , novikov & polnarev 1995 ) , or of the gaia project ( lindegren & perryman 1996 ) will not provide a useful macho mass determination .    there is a region of parameter space in which the effects of acceleration in earth s orbital motion are too small for the sim to measure ( cf .",
    "boden et al .",
    "this includes very short events with @xmath40 year , and the case when the relative parallax @xmath16 is very small .",
    "so , if the lenses responsible for the lmc lensing are in the lmc itself ( sahu 1994 ) then the astrometric effects are so small ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) that it will be impossible to determine their masses and distances accurately",
    ". however , it will be still possible to establish that they are close to the sources , i.e. within the lmc rather than in the galactic halo .",
    "all classical microlensing searches monitor millions of stars to detect a few events which come at random time .",
    "miralda - escud ( 1996 ) and paczyski ( 1995 , 1996b ) pointed out that there is a very different regime of microlensing when we begin not with the sources but with the lenses .",
    "this works best when the lenses are selected as stars with very large proper motions , indicating they are relatively nearby , and therefore their angular einstein ring radii are relatively large ( cf . equation 1 ) .",
    "the astrometric effects have a large effective cross - section .",
    "for example , the barnard s star ( van de kamp 1971 ) has a parallax of @xmath41 , and a proper motion of @xmath42 per year . if we adopt its mass to be @xmath43 , we obtain for its einstein ring radius @xmath44 a position of a distant background star passing by at an angular distance of @xmath45 is displaced by lensing by 100 @xmath46  a huge effect for the sim , which in this case could determine the mass of barnard s star with @xmath4 accuracy .",
    "the large proper motion combined with the large astrometric cross section implies that the useful background stars may be looked for in a large area in the sky .",
    "adoptic 3 years as a pessimistic life span for sim implies that the barnatd s star alone will cover an area @xmath47 in the sky .",
    "a lower limit to the number of lensing events for which the sim will be able to make accurate mass determination for the lenses can be obtained using hipparcos catalog ( perryman et al .",
    "there are 12,204 stars in the catalog with the distance less than 100 pc and proper motion @xmath13 larger than @xmath48 .",
    "their masses can be estimated with the mass - luminosity relation , and therefore the corresponding einstein ring radii can be calculated . adopting @xmath49 as the required astrometric displacement @xmath50 due to lensing , the minimum impact parameter @xmath20 can be calculated with eq .",
    "5 . combining all these data it is possible to calculate the time scale for lensing event , @xmath51 , and the area of the sky swept by each star during a three year time interval : @xmath52 .",
    "the total area swept by all 12,204 stars is @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 of the whole sky . as stars within 100 pc",
    "are distributed isotropically in the sky , we may expect to find @xmath55 stars brighter than @xmath56 , mag and @xmath57 stars brighter than @xmath58 mag ( cf .",
    "table 4.2 of mihalas & binney 1983 ) in the total area swept by these stars during three years . a median time scale for the microlensing events , weighted by the area in the sky swept by the stars , turns out to be a convenient 7 months , with",
    "80% of event time scales expected in the range 2 months - 2 years . for each of the events a @xmath59 astrometric accuracy implies 1% accurate mass determination .",
    "note , that in this case the lensing star is bright , and the lensed source is faint , but clearly resolved with the sim .",
    "the relative astrometry of the two stars will provide the relative proper motion @xmath60 , the relative parallax @xmath16 , and the einstein ring radius @xmath61 from the analysis of displacements @xmath50 as given with eq .",
    "( 5 ) , which in this case refers to the dominant image of the source .",
    "the lens mass follows from eq .",
    "if the gravitational displacement requirement is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath62 , then the total area swept by the 12,204 high proper motion hipparcos stars in 3 years increases to @xmath63 , i.e. it is larger by a factor 3.3 compared to the previous case , and the number of possible events increases by the same factor . a median time scale increases to 1.6 years .",
    "this shows the importance of a precise astrometry : the higher the accuracy , the more lensing events can be used for accurate mass determination .    obviously , there are many more stars which are too faint to be in the hipparcos catalog , but which have large proper motion ( e.g. luyten 1976 ) , and will be suitable for accurate mass determination",
    ". it would be very interesting to have the entire sky searched for faint , ( 20th mag ) high proper motion ( @xmath64 1/year ) stars , as some of them may turn out to be brown dwarfs , the difference between a star and a brown dwarf is best established with an accurate mass determination , and this will be possible with the sim .",
    "when the angular impact parameter is smaller than the angular source radius then an accurate microlensing light curve can be used to obtain the ratio of the two angles .",
    "if the effective temperature of the source is estimated from its color and/or spectrum then its surface brightness can also be estimated ; combining this with the observed flux can be used to determine the source angular diameter , and the angular einstein ring radius .",
    "finally , the relative proper motion is obtained by dividing the einstein ring radius by the event time scale , hence the name : ` proper motion event ' ( cf .",
    "gould 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "it may be useful to reverse this process as stellar effective temperatures are not known all that well .",
    "sim s astrometry of microlensing events will provide accurate measurements of the relative proper motions between the lens and the source . combining this with an accurate light curve of a ` proper motion event '",
    "will give the angular stellar radius , which in turn will be used to determine the effective temperature of the lensed star .",
    "the first spectacular example of a microlensing event of this type was recently provided by the macho alert 95 - 30 ( alcock et al .",
    "the ratio of the angular impact parameter to the angular source radius was determined to be @xmath65 .",
    "had the einstein ring radius been measured with sim - like astrometry the angular diameter of the lensed star would have been known to @xmath4 accuracy , comparable to the best existing stellar measurements . of course , accurate astrometry was not available , and the source colors and spectra were used to estimate stellar radius , and the proper motion with a precision of only @xmath66 .",
    "the example of macho alert 95 - 30 demonstrates that the accuracy of stellar radii determination with @xmath67 astrometry of resolved microlensing events is comparable to that achieved with the best detached eclipsing binaries ( cf .",
    "andersen 1991 ) , or the best interferometric measurements ( shao & colavita 1992 ) .",
    "once the angular stellar radius is measured , the determination of the effective temperature is a standard procedure .",
    "a @xmath67 astrometry of microlensing events can be used to determine the lens masses and the source radii ( and hence their effective temperatures ) , but it requires target of opportunity mode of operation . in order to be useful the space interferometry mission ( allen , shao , & peterson 1997 , boden , shao & van buren 1997 ) would have to respond to ground based alerts within a few weeks .    the only way to measure masses of single objects with an accuracy of @xmath4 is with gravitational lensing .",
    "lensing events caused by nearby high proper motion stars passing within @xmath68 of distant background stars , can be predicted many years into the future , making it possible to prepare the sim s observing program ahead of time , with no need for the too operation ."
