    "years later , an explanation for this observation was given by albert einstein , who traced it to the random collisions between the grains and the water molecules @xcite .",
    "these collisions cause the brownian particle to exhibit a `` random walk '' in space - a phenomenon also known as single particle diffusion . brownian motion",
    "can be described by the diffusion equation for the particle s probability density function ( pdf ) , which in one - dimension ( 1d ) reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote , respectively , coordinate and time , and @xmath8 is the diffusion coefficient . assuming a dirac delta - function initial condition @xmath9 , the solution of eq .",

    "an alternative route for describing the motion of a brownian particle is the langevin equation @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote , respectively , the mass and velocity of the particle . in this description ,",
    "the impact of the random collisions on the brownian particle is realized through the action of two forces , represented by the terms on the r.h.s .  of the equation .",
    "the first is a friction force representing the statistical average of the collision forces , while the second is a random gaussian white noise accounting for the force distribution around the mean value .",
    "since the magnitude of the collision forces depends on the characteristic thermal velocity of the molecules of the embedding fluid , the friction coefficient @xmath16 in langevin s equation ( [ eq : langevinsimple ] ) must depend on the temperature , @xmath17 .",
    "it should also be related to the diffusion coefficient , @xmath8 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffsimple ] ) .",
    "the relation , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant ) , is known as einstein s relation , which is closely related to the more general fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . in order for the latter to be satisfied",

    "two comments regarding langevin s equation ( [ eq : langevinsimple ] ) should be made .",
    "first , the equation describes brownian diffusive dynamics only at large time scales . on short time",
    "scales , langevin dynamics is ballistic ( inertial ) .",
    "the crossover between the ballistic and diffusive regimes occurs at @xmath24 .",
    "second , the equation neglects the influence of the motion of the brownian particle on the embedding fluid .",
    "the fluid acts as an ideal heat bath whose properties remain unaffected by the presence of the moving brownian particle .",
    "this latter assumption is justified when the number of fluid molecules is macroscopically large , and when the momentum and energy are locally transferred to the bulk fluid much faster than any other relevant time scale of the dynamics .",
    "the difference between the diffusion equation approach to brownian dynamics and the langevin equation formalism becomes more significant when one deals with diffusion in a medium with a position - dependent friction coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "these types of dynamics are often associated with the it - stratonovich dilemma @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study specific examples of such dynamics occuring in systems with power - law diffusion coefficients @xmath26 .",
    "model systems with spatially - dependent diffusivity have been receiving renewed interest recently due to their relevance to single particle experiments involving femto - newton force measurements @xcite .",
    "the dilemma itself is not the main topic of this paper , and we refer the reader to textbooks on stochastic dynamics , e.g.  @xcite , for more details . here",
    "we summarize only the highlights relevant to this work :    \\1 .",
    "the generalization of eq .",

    "the corresponding langevin equation reads @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 , which is a natural generalization of einstein s relation @xcite .",
    "a dilemma arises when the langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) is integrated over time in order to calculate the trajectory of the particle @xcite .",
    "since the particle moves during the infinitesimal time step @xmath32 , the value of @xmath25 also changes , and the langevin equation of motion must be supplemented with a convention ( rule ) for choosing the value of @xmath25 .",
    "the name `` it - stratonovich dilemma '' assigned to the ambiguity about the choice of interpretation is after the two most commonly used conventions - the one of it which uses the value of @xmath16 at the beginning of the time step , and the one of stratonovich which takes the average of the friction function at the initial and the end points .",

    "i.e. , when the inertial term on the l.h.s .  of eq .",

    "this difference between underdamped dynamics and its overdamped limiting case ( see item 4 above ) stems from fact that in the latter , the velocity is physically ill - defined ( since it is proportional to the white noise @xmath34 ) , while in the former , it remains finite and follows the equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "formally ( mathematically ) speaking , there is no dilemma in the second - order ( in @xmath6 ) equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) .",
    "however , the rate of convergence of numerical simulation - results toward the theoretical pdf [ i.e. , the solution of eq .",

    "this scenario , however , is unphysical , and it stems from the unphysical nature of langevin s equation which only considers the influence of the medium on the particle but ignores the impact of the particle on the medium . from momentum conservation",
    "we know that any change in the momentum of the brownian particle must be countered by an opposite change in the momentum of the molecules of the medium .",
    "this implies that when the particle is reflected from the origin , it exerts a force on the friction singularity , and this force will cause changes in the medium that would not allow the singularity to be long - lived .    apart from the divergence of @xmath64 at the origin , it is also interesting to consider the ramifications of the rapid drop in @xmath25 in the limits @xmath83 . for @xmath3 , the integral over @xmath25 from @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is finite , implying that the particle s ballistic distance may diverge .",
