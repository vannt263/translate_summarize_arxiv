    "fourier s law of heat conduction @xcite , according to which the heat current in a material is proportional to the gradient of its local temperature , has over the last two centuries proved a powerful phenomenological tool for describing the process of energy transfer in physical systems . yet , in spite of being well understood at a macroscopic level , the derivation of this law from a microscopic point of view arguably remains one of mathematical physics great challenges .",
    "thus , in their millenium review , bonetto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , after offering `` a selective overview of the current state of our [ then ] knowledge ( more precisely of our ignorance ) regarding the derivation of fourier s law '' , proceeded to the observation that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` there is however at present no rigorous mathematical derivation of fourier s law [  ] for any system ( or model ) with a deterministic , e.g. hamiltonian , microscopic evolution .

    "other useful reviews devoted to the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of low - dimensional systems include references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "building upon the earlier work of bunimovich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , gaspard and gilbert then set out in 2008 @xcite to consider the _ regime of rare interactions _ of a class of models , henceforth referred to as gg - models , which , from the point of view of ergodic theory @xcite , are intermediate between the gas of hard balls and the periodic lorentz gas .",
    "in general , the gg - model can be thought of as a billiard chain ( or @xmath0-network in dimension @xmath1 ) of @xmath2-dimensional cells with ( semi- ) dispersing walls , each containing a single ball particle trapped inside it .",
    "ball particles are moreover let to interact among neighbours under the control of the geometry of the interface between their respective cells .",
    "hence by excluding mass transport the model focuses on energy transport solely .    a standard two - step strategy for analysing the process of heat transport is to first identify the conditions under which a mesoscopic description can be attained from the microscopic one , and second , by taking the hydrodynamic limit of the mesoscopic process to obtain , in the diffusive scaling , the heat equation at the macroscopic scale .",
    "the completion of this step also implies gaining an analytical form for the coefficient of heat conductivity .",
    "the present work does not deal with the analysis of the second step of this strategy .",
    "in particular , we will not address the precise form of the coefficient of thermal conductivity associated with our model .",
    "we note , however , that sasada , inspired by stefano olla s remarks on the results announced in reference @xcite , recently reported @xcite that the coefficient of heat conductivity figuring in the papers of gaspard and gilbert , see in particular reference @xcite , corresponds to the contribution to the heat conductivity from the static correlations alone , while the true transport coefficient should also include a contribution from dynamic correlations .",
    "whereas the latter contribution appears to be very small in comparison to the former , it does not vanish .",
    "this issue , which deserves further clarification , will be the subject of future work .",
    "another important remark here is that for handling the second step of the strategy for gg - models the necessary spectral gap has already been obtained in reference @xcite ; see also reference @xcite .",
    "the analogous lower estimate of the spectral gap for the model to be introduced below is so far an open question .",
    "we mention here that progress in this area has been paralleled by interesting prospects aiming at understanding the emergence of fourier s law when small noise is added to simple deterministic models , e.g.  to weakly anharmonic crystals @xcite , or harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "such systems have also been considered in regimes of rare interactions @xcite another line of research aims at studying energy exchanges between the cells of regular lattices through the mediation of point particles @xcite ; see also reference @xcite for recent progress based on the seminal work of kipnis _ et al .",
    "a mixture of those two approaches was treated in reference @xcite .",
    "going back to the first step of the strategy described above , in the gg - model , the reduction from the deterministic dynamics at the microscopic scale to a stochastic process at the mesoscopic scale , emerges in the _ rare interaction limit _ ( ril ) , out of a two - stage relaxation process . in the ril , the rate of interactions between neighbouring ball particles is arbitrarily low , which implies that a form of local equilibrium is achieved on the scale of every cell , each kept at constant energy .",
    "the convergence to local equilibrium is indeed controlled by the rate of collisions between a particle and the walls of its cell , which can be made much larger than the rate of binary collisions , i.  e. of collisions between two neighbouring particles .",
    "since averaging takes place , energy transfers between neighbouring particles behave stochastically , with every cell of the system acting as a fundamental unit whose state is specified by the energy of its ball particle . in effect , the ril yields for the hamiltonian kinetic equation of any finite subsystem the generator of a markov jump process for the energies of the ball particles .",
    "the gg - model can consist of networks of two - dimensional particles ( discs ) confined to identical cells @xcite .",
    "it can also consist of networks of three ( or higher)-dimensional particles ( spheres ) confined to identical cells @xcite .",
    "one can think of extensions of such models with several particles trapped in every cell ; their numbers may be identical or vary from cell to cell and the cells of the network may no be all identical .",
    "the dimensionality of the dynamics would then vary from cell to cell .",
    "one main goal of the present paper is to introduce yet another version of the gg - model , the simplest of its class , for which we deem the ( mathematically rigorous ) completion of the first step of the gg - strategy realistic .",
    "let us explain why we think that such a modification is necessary .",
    "the ` simplest ' task in the original gg - programme is the treatment of a two - cell system with two interacting discs .",
    "this is actually isomorphic to a 4-dimensional semi - dispersing billiard .",
    "however , statistical properties of higher - dimensional ( larger than two ) billiards are so far understood exclusively for finite - horizon strictly dispersing billiards @xcite , and even then only under the notorious ` complexity hypothesis ' .",
    "it was therefore suggested in reference  @xcite that by exploiting the ril feature of the approach of reference  @xcite , a way out of this high - dimensional quagmire would be to apply the method of ` standard pairs ' @xcite , a very efficient tool stemming from the development of markov approximation methods , which permits the use of statistical properties of lower dimensional projections of the model  in this case of well - understood planar sinai - billiards .",
    "be that as it may , this idea led to further technical difficulties .",
    "for this reason we introduce below a _ ball - piston model _ , which belongs to the class of gg - models , but for which the dimension of the ( simplest ) isomorphic semi - dispersing billiard shrinks from 4 to 3 . in this model , a disc particle caged in a two - dimensional cell with dispersing walls",
    "is let to interact with a ` piston ' moving in a one - dimensional interval .",
    "this is isomorphic to a 3-dimensional semi - dispersing billiard .",
    "we believe that coping with its ril is already a realistic question , which is the subject of a longer project , involving four of us , and still in progress ; as to the first related publication , see @xcite .",
    "suffice it to say here that the application of the method of standard pairs to the ball - piston model is met with difficulties similar to those alluded to above .",
    "however , in this model their occurrence can be tracked and explicitly described and ultimately , as we hope , treated .    in this respect",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the method of standard pairs has already been successfully applied to models of heat conduction .",
    "thus , in reference @xcite a model of weakly interacting anosov flows was considered for which the appropriate long time limit is a chain of interacting diffusion processes rather than the kind of markov jump processes which are expected to arise in rarely interacting systems .",
    "more recently , in reference @xcite , the authors obtained an exponential limit law for the first encounter of two small discs on a planar sinai billiard table , a result somewhat closer to our program .",
    "a further aim of the present work is the calculation of several relevant characteristics of the ball - piston model , in particular :    * the unconditional and conditional mean free times of binary collisions ( conditioning on the outgoing energy partition between the two particles after a binary collision ) ; * the transition kernel of the markov jump process expected to emerge in the ril ; * the restriction of the invariant measure to the binary collision surface at fixed energy .",
    "since some of these calculations are new , even as to their mathematical content , we endeavour to formulate our arguments in a language which we hope will be accessible to both mathematicians and physicists .    finally , we describe a computational test of the conjecture that the emerging mesoscopic limit of the rarely interacting ball - piston model is indeed the markov jump process we claim it is .",
    "this conjecture relies on the assumption that , in the ril , two successive binary collisions are separated by enough wall collision events that averaging takes place .",
    "we test this by considering several outgoing laws from a binary collision and compare the ingoing laws at the next binary collision event to the relevant equilibrium law by using the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite .",
    "we provide numerical evidence that reducing the rate of binary collisions yields a limiting distribution of energy exchanges consistent with the expected result .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the ball - piston model is introduced in section  [ sec : minmodel ] .",
    "section [ sec : mft ] is devoted to the calculation of the ball - piston mean free time and collision rate . in section  [ sec",
    ": condmft ] we introduce the notion of conditional mean free time and proceed to its calculation .",
    "the derivation of the transition kernel of the conjectured markov jump process is provided in section  [ sec : stoch ] , together with a description of our numerical test of the validity of the conjecture , as well as a discussion of numerical results .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "specific calculations are provided in appendix  [ app : vol ] ( volume integrals ) , appendix  [ app : wall ] ( wall collision frequencies ) and appendix  [ app : cnuep ] ( restriction of the invariant measure to the binary collision surface at fixed energy ) .",
    "the ball - piston gas , shown in figure  [ fig : bpmanycells ] , is a collection of alternating balls and pistons , arranged in a periodic structure , with every particle confined to its own cell .",
    "balls and pistons are particles of two different types . on the one hand , balls are point - particles with two degrees of freedom .",
    "they move in two - dimensional closed cells whose boundaries are defined by impenetrable circular obstacles placed at the vertices of a square lattice .",
    "pistons , on the other hand , have only one degree of freedom .",
    "they are one - dimensional vertical or horizontal line - segments that are allowed to move back and forth along perpendicular intervals placed between two neighbouring ball cells .",
    "whereas pistons are unaffected by the presence of the circular obstacles in the ball cells , they do interact elastically with balls whenever collisions occur , thereby exchanging their horizontal or vertical velocity components ( both balls and pistons have unit masses ) . by choosing the lengths of the piston cells large enough that their extremities lay inside the ball cells ( one symmetrically on each side ) , we allow for energy exchanges between every ball and piston pair , the likelihood of which depends on the piston s penetration length into the ball cell . in turn , whereas mass transport of either species is prohibited by the confining walls in every cell , energy exchanges between balls and pistons induce heat transport on the scale of the ball - piston gas .",
    "0.61     0.37     the present study focuses on a minimal version of the ball - piston gas , such as shown in figure  [ fig : modelsglcell ] . here",
    "a single pair of ball and piston  in this case a horizontally moving vertical line - segment  is let to interact .",
    "this model can in fact be viewed as a three - dimensional billiard , rendered in figure  [ fig : model3d ] : it is equivalent to the free motion of a point - particle in a three - dimensional cavity , undergoing elastic reflections upon its boundary .",
    "the corresponding collision map is a four - dimensional symplectic map .",
    "the parameters relevant to the definition of the model are displayed in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "a point - particle ( ball ) of unit mass moves freely in the interior of a cell ( the ball cell ) whose boundaries are delimited by four arc - circles of common radius @xmath3 , @xmath4 , centered at the four corners of a unit cell , and performs elastic collisions with them . a vertical line segment of height @xmath5 and unit mass , which we call piston , moves horizontally back and forth between the two edges of an interval of length @xmath6 ( the piston cell ) , centered at the middle point of the cell s right edge , where @xmath7 measures the length of the interval between the two intersections of opposite discs ( and such that @xmath8 ) .",
    "the parameter is imposed so as to prevent overlap between the piston and a similar hypothetical vertical piston centered on either of the top and bottom edges of the cell , such as in the cells depicted in figure  [ fig : bpmanycells ] . ]",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , measures the length of penetration of the piston inside the ball cell and therefore determines the possibility of interactions between the ball and the piston .",
    "the height of the piston , @xmath11 , is such that , at its left - most position , it lies inside the boundary of the ball cell .",
    "the positions of the ball and piston must be initially chosen so that the ball is located to the left of the piston ; the ball can not move passed the piston .",
    "we let @xmath12 denote the three - dimensional ball - piston configuration space and @xmath13 its boundary , where @xmath14 is the surface of ball - piston collisions , @xmath15 the surface of ball - wall collisions , and @xmath16 the surface of piston - wall collisions . in figure",

    "they are such that :    @xmath25    the associated velocity vector is @xmath26 .",

    "similarly , we define the ball - piston free flight time to be the time separating two successive collisions between the ball and piston ,    @xmath45    by ergodicity , the mean free time , which is defined to be the infinite @xmath2 limit of the time to the @xmath2th collision ( with any of the surface elements of the three - dimensional billiard cavity ) divided by the number of collisions @xmath2 , almost surely exists and is independent of the initial condition if the latter is sampled with respect to the natural invariant measure of the billiard flow .",
    "it is then equal to    @xmath46    measured in terms of the natural invariant measure of the billiard map on @xmath31 .",

    ", we recover the conditional collision rate after integrating equation over @xmath173 ,    @xmath174      although equation is a property of the equilibrium system , we argue that it also provides an accurate description of the energy exchange process between the ball and piston away from equilibrium , provided we consider the limiting regime of rare interactions  that is , when the penetration length of the piston into the domain of the ball is arbitrarily small , @xmath175 .",
    "indeed , under this assumption , the ball and piston typically undergo many wall - collision events between every binary collision , so that a relaxation to equilibrium of the ball - piston pair at fixed energies effectively takes place before the next occurrence of a binary collision .    as a result , in the limiting regime of rare interactions ,",
    "the process of energy exchanges is expected to converge to a markov jump process with kernel .",
    "indeed , the markov property essentially means that if one knows not only the present energy partition , but also has information about its history , this additional information does not improve one s ability to predict the future evolution of the energy partition .",
    "correspondingly , convergence to a markov process means that if @xmath176 decreases , then information about the past influences the future less and less .",
    "so we need to see that if we start the system with a given energy partition between the disk and piston , but away from the equilibrium measure ( conditioned on the energy surface ) , then , as @xmath64 , we measure nearly the same jump rates as in .",
    "this is expected to hold exactly because of the relaxation to ( conditional ) equilibrium during the many wall - collisions that typically precede the first energy exchange .    according to this argument",
    ", the time - evolution of the ball - piston pair energy distribution @xmath177 may be described by the following master equation :    @xmath178\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the method used to derive this result relies on geometric and measure - theoretic arguments . an alternative approach based on kinetic theory , such as used in references @xcite , yields the same results .",
    "we want to further substantiate the assertion that  with an appropriate rescaling of time ",
    "the actual process of energy exchanges produced by the ball - piston billiard has a well - defined limit when @xmath123 , and that the limiting process is indeed markovian and described by equation .",
    "based on the heuristic arguments presented in section  [ sec : stoconv ] , we should therefore check that , as @xmath9 decreases , the collision rate and post - collision energy distribution become arbitrarily close to the limits associated with the process generated by equation , independently of our information about the past , that is , independently of the ( non - equilibrium ) initial distribution we sample our energy partition with .",
    "moreover the notion that we have limited information about the past reflects a lack of precise knowledge of the initial conditions .",
    "our initial distribution should therefore be smooth .",
    "finally , since there is , of course , no hope of checking that this is convergence holds for _ every _ initial distribution , we pick a specific family of smooth initial measures on the energy surface , and check convergence for it .",
    "in particular we consider , for different values of @xmath9 , an initial state @xmath150 of the billiard map , with position @xmath54 uniformly distributed on the collision surface @xmath14 and velocity @xmath100 as in , such that @xmath98 , with angle @xmath159 and sign @xmath164 now distributed _",
    "away _ from the distribution of density , and measure the distribution of ingoing velocities at the first ball - piston collision event .",
    "the velocity @xmath100 , now such that @xmath151 , may again be parametrised as in , with values of @xmath159 and @xmath164 different from the outgoing initial velocity , but @xmath110 unchanged .",
    "since we are considering a marginal velocity distribution , apart from the two values of the sign @xmath164 , this distribution is a function of a single real variable , @xmath159 . irrespective of the choice of piston energy @xmath110 ( with ball energy @xmath179 ) , we expect to find a distribution of ingoing @xmath159 and @xmath164 that , as @xmath64 , becomes arbitrarily close to the distribution on the constant @xmath110 circles induced by the equilibrium measure .",
    "that is because , in the absence of ball - piston collisions , the wall - collision events will typically induce a relaxation of the billiard dynamics to the measure of density , which is a true invariant measure of the non - interacting ball - piston dynamics when their energies are fixed to the corresponding values . in other words , when @xmath9 is small , the billiard dynamics is likely to perform many wall collision events before first hitting the ball - piston collision surface @xmath49 .",
    "the first hitting distribution is thus expected to converge to the distribution of density , which happens to be an equilibrium distribution of the ball - piston dynamics when interactions are turned off ( @xmath180 ) .    to be specific , let    @xmath181    and normalise these densities so that @xmath182 .",

    "<S> using heuristic arguments and numerical analysis , we argue that , in a regime of rare interactions , the billiard process converges to a markov jump process for the energy exchanges and obtain the expression of its generator . </S>"
