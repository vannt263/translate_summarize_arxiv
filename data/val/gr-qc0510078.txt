    "the major success of inflationary cosmology is in simultaneously offering an explanation for the homogeneity of the universe along with a mechanism that explains its inhomogeneity .",
    "the mechanism generating inhomogeneities involves quantum fluctuations in the fields that represent the dominant form of stress - energy during the inflationary epoch , which is a postulated potential dominated era of the early universe ( which explains the homogeneity ) .",
    "the dynamics of the transition from the inflationary era to our current ",
    "kinetic  or  rest mass  dominated era are crucial in the formation of inhomogeneities , and in particular fix how much these quantum fluctuations will be amplified during the transition . in order to fully quantify the effect of these fluctuations on the large - scale geometry of the universe we can in principle use the field equations of general relativity to tell us exactly how the coupled matter and metric fluctuations clasically behave",
    "of course , in practice , we can not solve the full field equations for this scenario so we solve simplified approximations of the field equations within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory . at linear order",
    "the quantized cosmological perturbation theory has emerged as the primary tool to investigate the behaviour of fluctuations in the inflationary era , where e.g. it predicts an approximately scale - free spectrum of density fluctuations ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "however , the beguiling mystery of the cosmological constant and dark matter / energy problems only deepens with increasingly accurate observations .",
    "there has been renewed interest in the past few years in the effect of higher order corrections to the linearized einstein equations on both early and late - time physics in inflation .",
    "suggestions have been made that superhorizon higher order corrections to linearized theory , on superhorizon scales ( i.e. larger than the hubble radius ) , can take the form of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this could produce a dynamical relaxation mechanism for the bare cosmological constant ( starting from @xcite , to @xcite , @xcite most recently , and many references therein ) . the measurability or physical reality of these superhorizon backreaction effects has been a contentious issue ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and reference therein ) , and many questions remain regarding the link between local subhorizon physics and these superhorizon backreactions .",
    "in this paper we do not add to the discussion of measurability , but focus rather on explicitly evaluating the second order corrections to the right hand side of the homogeneous einstein equations in perturbation theory . at second order in perturbation theory",
    "one might even expect that , since the effect of second order contributions are _ cumulative _ over all wavenumbers , their relative amplitude may become comparable to that of first order.furthermore , if one thinks about solving the perturbed einstein constraint equations for the matter fluctuations and putting these solutions back into the perturbed evolution equations , it is not hard to see that some of the second order corrections could in fact be divided by a so - called slow - roll parameter .",
    "this only adds to the worry that the second order terms could plausibly dominate for a ",
    "slow enough  roll in the background .",
    "it is clear that in the limit as the slow - roll parameter goes to zero , so that the background universe tends to de sitter , the first order corrections go to zero and the second order fluctuations dominate in their effect on the gravitational field . at what values of the slow - roll parameter do the second order",
    "perturbations dominate over the linear ones ?",
    "the most radical possibility is that the slow - roll conditions are precisely the conditions that the second order perturbations dominate .",
    "such questions appear to be behind some of the concerns raised by l. grischuk in @xcite about the consistency of linearized perturbation theory in inflation .",
    "the technical complications of sorting out the second order gauge issues and other nonlinear effects such tensor perturbations seeding scalar perturbations are many , but rendered tractable with the aid of packages such as grtensor for maple @xcite . in this paper we calculate the cumulative second order contributions to the homogeneous energy density and pressure .",
    "we do not address questions of the ultraviolet ( short wavelength ) regularization of the fluctuations but focus on the superhorizon fluctuations .",
    "indeed , we pay special attention to the case where one considers the cumulative effect of hubble sized to nearly homogeneous contributions on the homogeneous mode .    in past work effective approximation methods have been used to evaluate such contributions .",
    "one popular method characterizes the backreactions in terms of an effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 . in this method",
    "there are two contributions to @xmath1 : the quadratic matter energy momentum tensor and the contribution of the first order gravity perturbations . using early work by brill , hartle and isaacson ( @xcite , @xcite ) among others ,",
    "the einstein equations are expanded to second order assuming the linearized equations hold ( so that they drop out ) .",
    "then the remaining terms are spatially averaged with respect to the non - dynamical background metric and the resulting equations are interpreted as equations for a new homogeneous metric @xmath2 which include the effects of quadratic linear perturbations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spatially averaged  backreaction ",
    "stress - energy defined by @xmath5 - \\frac{1}{\\kappa } g_{ab } [ ( \\delta g_{cd})^2 ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 in units where @xmath7 , @xmath8 indicates the n - th order perturbation of the object it acts on ( as explained more precisely in the next section ) .    it should be noted that , by construction , the zeroth order equations are not obeyed in this formulation . in this effective scenario one",
    "is solving for a new isotropic background metric which obeys equation ( 1 ) , and this can in itself raise difficult questions of consistency if one is interested in backreactions on inhomogeneous modes ( but is ok if one looks at just the homogeneous mode ) .",
    "this can be seen by considering the first variation of the hamiltonian action for a gravitational system , namely @xmath9 and assuming that the background constraints do _ not _ hold , i.e. @xmath10 . if one has",
    "_ homogeneous _",
    "variations then these linear terms will vanish _ anyway _ , whether or not the background equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "this is so because one can do a by - parts integration in the first and second terms above whose result will be boundary terms which can then be set to zero under reasonable assumptions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should also be noted that in their effective approach the full second order einstein equations are not solved , nor are second order coordinate transformations considered .",
    "this latter fact can be of considerable concern when interpreting the significance of higher order effects @xcite . in this sense",
    "the effective approach does not appear , to us , to be able to convincingly evaluate the higher - order corrections to einstein s equations , simply because it never actually considers them in the context of higher - order perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite and @xcite this effective approach is used to evaluate the dominant long - wavelength contributions to @xmath1 . defining the energy density and pressure at second order by ( using @xmath11 as the signature ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 , they find that these contributions have the effective equation of state @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to the equation of state of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "they also find that @xmath16 grows with time , partially because as inflation proceeds more and more length scales exceed the hubble scale and contribute to @xmath16 .",
    "these two results combined suggest their main claim , which is that the backreactions effectively create a negative , and growing , cosmological constant which can reduce the actual cosmological constant _ in the large_. locally one might expect the situation to be different .",
    "the first order modes should , _ locally _ , look like simple coordinate transformations of the homogeneous solutions , and their effect on higher order metric and matter fluctuations to be again that of higher order coordinate transformations .",
    "as we stated earlier , we will not focus on these difficult issues of interpretation in this paper .",
    "instead , we focus on evaluating the higher order contributions to the background equation of state , and in particular calculate the quantity @xmath17 and its dipsersion . we follow a procedure of consistently ( though probably not convergently ) expanding the einstein equations to second order and solving a subset of them assuming the zeroth and linear order equations hold .",
    "we do this about a flat frw spacetime in which the dominant gravitating matter is a slowly - rolling , minimally coupled , scalar field @xmath18 , and we only study the effect of fluctuations on spatial scales exceeding the hubble radius . in order to define the second order energy density and isotropic pressure",
    ", we give an invariant definition of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in terms of the eigenvalues of the stress energy tensor . due to the mixing of tensor and scalar waves",
    ", these fluctuations will not only arise from second order scalar modes but also from quadratic combinations of scalar - scalar and tensor - tensor modes at second order .",
    "we find that in general @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but that @xmath23 does become small .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , we also find that the relative amplitude of the second order dipsersion @xmath24 dominates over its linear counterpart @xmath25 for a wide range of slow - roll parameters in the background .",
    "in linear cosmological perturbation theory @xcite the tensor , vector , and scalar metric modes all decouple , which justifies examining only one class of modes at a time to make the calculations simpler .",
    "furthermore , depending on the initial conditions one takes for the linear metric modes at the beginning of inflation ( a contentious issue ) , the scalar modes are typically more important than the gravitational modes at the end of inflation . given this ,",
    "the fact that scalar modes directly lead to energy density fluctuations required for structure formation , and the fact that for longwavelength perturbations gravity wave terms are typically suppressed by factors of @xmath26 , cosmological perturbations have become synonymous with scalar perturbations . at second order",
    ", however , it is well known that pure second order modes have products of tensor , vector , and scalar modes as sources .",
    "for example , linear tensor fluctuations can induce second order scalar modes via the second order field equations . in order to describe this",
    "it becomes essential to include all three classes of modes ( scalar , vector , and tensor ) as sources for the higher order gravitational radiation .    for fluctuations about a spatially flat frw background in comoving",
    "coordinates @xmath27 the perturbed metric may be written down as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the strength of the linear perturbation , @xmath30 denote purely spatial indices , and @xmath31 is the usual scale factor .",
    "together with the matter perturbations of the scalar matter @xmath18 , defined by @xmath32 the perturbations are @xmath33 at linear order and @xmath34 at second order .",
    "the backreactions or higher corrections are suitably integrated quadratic combinations of terms from the former set , and they affect the longwavelength part of the latter set of variables . in principle , their evolution is determined by substituting the above metric and matter perturbations into the einstein equations and solving these at second order subject to the linearized and background equations , i.e. we solve @xmath35 and also demand that the linearized and zeroth - order ( background ) field equations @xmath36 hold . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the usual einstein tensor and @xmath38 is the stress - energy for a minimally coupled scalar field .    in the following we assume that the spatial dependence of the fluctuations is of the form @xmath39 , and we express the longwavelength approximation by @xmath40 here",
    ", @xmath41 is the hubble parameter that corresponds to the scale factor expansion @xmath42 , @xmath43 and we take the potential of the slowly - rolling background scalar field to be @xmath44 for which the only non - trivial slow - roll condition is @xmath45 .",
    "one should note that @xmath46 , and we write @xmath47 so that the desitter limit corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "conservation of energy for a slowly - rolling scalar field in this potential , with initial value @xmath49 , requires that @xmath50 take the form @xmath51 and we shall only consider comoving times @xmath52 such that @xmath53 .",
    "therefore we have three small parameters in this problem : @xmath29 ( the strength of the matter and metric fluctuations ) , @xmath54 ( slow - roll parameter associated with our choice of inflaton potential ) , and @xmath55 , the long - wavelength parameter .",
    "however , only two of these small parameters are independent as the order of the metric and matter fluctuations is a direct product of the physics of the slow - roll parameter , so the scale of @xmath29 is in some sense dynamically set . unless otherwise specified , all future references to the order of a quantity will refer to its order in @xmath29",
    ". the solutions to equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) will be invariant under under a class of diffeomorphisms which are themselves functions of @xmath29 . by expanding out the diffeomorphisms order by order in @xmath29",
    ", one can apply first order , second order , etc .",
    ", coordinate transformations to the solutions of the first order , second order , etc . , solutions of ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) . in particular",
    ", one can choose these transformations to not only simplify the form of the solutions and the equations themselves , but to also deduce what part of the metric and matter fluctuations is physical and what part is just a coordinate effect .",
    "as compared to the general covariance of the full ( infinite order ) theory , which allows for arbitrary coordinate transformations , within the framework of second - order perturbation theory we consider only linear and second order infinitesimal parts of these coordinate transformations ( called gauge transformations in cosmological perturbation theory ) .",
    "the individual perturbations of the metric or stress - energy components will change in some well - defined way under such gauge transformations , and there will in general exist ( an infinite number ) of combinations of fluctuations which are invariant , to second order , under this restricted class of coordinate transformations .    indeed , one can write a general @xmath29-dependent coordinate transformation by @xmath56 and define an associated _ linearized _ coordinate transformation by @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and similarly we can define the _ second - order _ coordinate transformation by @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the metric @xmath60 is a tensor it will in general transform by @xmath61 one can show that under a linear coordinate transformation the linear metric fluctuations @xmath62 suffer the change ( using equation ( 13 ) ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the usual lie derivative along the vector @xmath65 . similarly using equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) and the notation of equation ( 16 )",

    "this implies , for example , that the changes in the second order stress energy @xmath69 of equation ( 6 ) caused by the gauge transformation will depend on both @xmath65 and @xmath68 , the first and second order gauge transformations .    in standard cosmological perturbation theory one",

    "it should be noted that longitudinal gauge only fixes the _ scalar _ part of the metric into diagonal form , and its simple form relies crucially on the form of the anisotropies of the perturbed stress energy .",
    "however for our problem , since we obviously can not diagonalize the _ entire _ linear order metric because of the presence of tt gravity waves , we find it convenient to emulate the harmonic gauge from the full theory , namely @xmath73 to linear order this gauge choice corresponds to setting @xmath74 which fixes , to within trivial residual gauge freedoms , the linearized metric perturbation regardless of the form of the perturbed stress energy and is sometimes known as the poisson gauge @xcite .",
    "clearly the longitudinal gauge for the scalar sector is a special case of ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , since it restricts only the _ potentials _",
    "@xmath75 of the metric fluctuations @xmath76 .",
    "the primary physical advantage in using this generalization of the longitudinal gauge is that one can unambiguously transform to any gauge while easily keeping track of the residual freedoms , while the primary mathematical advantage is that they lead to a compact form for the perturbed hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",

    "how do the classical metric and matter fluctuations at second order influence the background equation of state , and in particular how does one assess the influence of the gravitational backreactions ?",
    "fortunately , within finite order perturbation theory we can avoid the conceptual and technical problems involved in defining local or quasi - local definitions of gravitational energy - momentum because , by definition , we have a preferred decomposition of the spacetime metric .",

    "this shows that the effect of a given linearized mode at some @xmath104 on the nearly homgeneous mode of @xmath152 is to make it time - dependent , as expected .    when we compute @xmath158 and @xmath16 in our exhaustive coordinate system we use the second and linear order constraints to eliminate the linearized matter fluctuation @xmath132 and the second order matter fluctuation @xmath142 , so that the final expression is left only in terms of the metric perturbations",
    "following such a procedure , we obtain the following result for the dominant longwavelength contributions : @xmath159 at first glance , it is immediately apparent that if we set @xmath160 ( as brandenberger et al do in @xcite and references therein ) then we obtain @xmath15 but that @xmath161 is not in general zero because of terms that involve ratios of small parameters : @xmath162 however , we do find that , given @xmath160 , quadratic scalar - scalar backreaction contributions generally do mimic that of a negative cosmological constant since @xmath163 , which is set to zero in their analysis .",
    "nevertheless , for sufficiently slow - roll it seems worrisome that for hubble - scale size fluctuations the second order contributions @xmath158 and @xmath16 can be comparable to @xmath107 and @xmath134 at a given @xmath104 , since as they stand equations ( 52 ) and ( 53 ) show that the second order contributions carry extra factors of slow - roll enhancement compared to equations ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) .",
    "these extra factors come directly from solving the constraints for the matter variables .",
    "however , it is clearly inconsistent to set @xmath152 to zero in our approach since it is also of second order and in fact contains terms proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "such a tactic also violates the second order field equations , which take into account that the metric fluctuation @xmath152 at a given scale will receive contributions from all of the fourier linear modes under consideration ( in our case , as we explain below , from the horizon to an approxiamtely homogeneous cutoff ) .",
    "furthermore since the purely second order contributions to the energy density and pressure at these superhorizon scales are not constants but can evolve in comoving time , the contributions may change significantly during the slow - roll era to the end of inflation .    in the following section we will examine the cumulative effect of the quadratic combinations of linear modes , averaged over superhubble scales , onto a given scale of the purely second order modes .",
    "for simplicity we will initially focus on the effect on the second order homogeneous mode .",
    "we strongly emphasize that the main gauge - fixing of the paper , as described by relations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , is not well - defined in the strictly homogeneous limit @xmath165 .",

    "we now consider the cumulative contributions to the energy density and pressure at second order due to the superhorizon modes . considering only super hubble fluctuations we know that the dominant linear modes are independent of time since the background equation of state , during slow - roll , is approximately time - independent . in terms of the fourier - decomposed @xmath166 ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations ( which we take to be gaussian ) during this era depend on @xmath104 in such a way that the fluctuations per decade are a constant .",

    "one can demand a consistency condition for linearized theory , namely that the second order contributions be subdominant compared to that of the linearized sector , i.e. @xmath195 . if we use the expressions ( 55 ) , ( 57 ) and ( 58 ) above , this demand is crudely equivalent to the condition that , for @xmath196 , @xmath197 i.e. the usual slow - roll condition will in general be violated if @xmath198 .",
    "thus inequality ( 60 ) suggests , within our scheme , that the breakdown of the linearized approximation occurs when one assumes the slow - roll condition for the background spacetime .",
    "furthermore it is apparent that , although the right hand side of ( 57 ) is not zero , the form of these dominant contributions is approximately that of a cosmological constant since @xmath199 .",
    "as we alluded to above , in the current gauge fixing we have chosen the homogeneous limit of the fluctuations is not well defined since , by equation ( 55 ) and the linear order equation @xmath200 , the lapse @xmath201 will diverge as @xmath202 . however , our results are valid even if one makes a gauge transformation which renders the superhorizon fluctuations well defined in the homogeneous limit .",
    "indeed , after making such a gauge transformation , hen the homogeneous limit is taken and the total lapse goes to the value @xmath203 while the offdiagonal terms go to @xmath204 , the central feature of  slow - roll  enhancement remains and the above arguments still apply .",

    "the off - diagonal terms @xmath214 induced in turn by this choice of @xmath85 will be well posed in the homogeneous limit since @xmath215 is what appears in the metric , and this will decay as @xmath216 .",
    "however , the diagonal spatial metric terms will in general receive a contribution of @xmath217 , which will get large as @xmath202 .",
    "since we implicitly use an ir cutoff of @xmath218 , beyond which equation ( 54 ) will not hold and may in fact be replaced by a relation which does not diverge with @xmath104 , these large contributions can be considered in some sense regulated .",
    "to second order the argument is very similar , only more tedious . given the above choice for the linear gauge - fixing as @xmath202 , we must pick a second order @xmath219 such that the second order shift and offdiagonal spatial terms go to zero in the limit @xmath202 .",
    "since @xmath220 where @xmath221 , one can show that the choice @xmath222\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] will yield @xmath223 .",
    "the offdiagonal , second order , spatial terms induced by the above transformation are @xmath224 which at worst diverge as @xmath225 .",
    "since only the expression @xmath226 appears in the metric , these offdiagonal terms in the metric smoothly go to zero in the homogeneous limit . once again",
    "the spatial diagonal contributions to @xmath149 will grow large as @xmath202 .",
    "now we can finally address the total effect of all these transformations on the quantities of interest , @xmath227 .",
    "to second order , for example , @xmath139 will be lie - dragged along @xmath65 and @xmath68 according to the tranformation @xmath228 and similarly for the averaged pressures @xmath20 . choosing the above expressions for @xmath229",
    ", we can see that the total effect on @xmath139 and @xmath20 will be to introduce terms that diverge like @xmath104 but are suppressed by factors of @xmath230 .",
    "such terms will be subdominant compared to the terms already present in the original gauge , or in other words , the gauge transformation which renders the metric diagonal in the homogeneous limit does not undo the dominant contributions to the energy density and pressure at second order .",
    "an important loophole in the above analysis resides in the fact that we compare the horizon scale ( frozen ) amplitudes of the linearized fluctuations to that of the homogeneous sector of the second order fluctuations .",
    "it is far from clear that this is an acceptable comparison to make , not least because we are directly cutting off the divergence of the linearized fluctuations by imposing an ir cutoff at @xmath179 and then comparing the amplitude of the second order fluctuations with that of the linearized fluctuations well beyond the cutoff .",
    "a valid criticism of this result is thus that it would be natural for the second order perturbations to dominate at the homogeneous scale simply because we have cut off the linearized fluctuations long before comparing their amplitude to that at second order , or in other words the spatial dependence induced by evaluating the ( quantum averaged ) second order amplitude at some @xmath231 may alter the conclusions of inequality ( 60 ) .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "however , we find that when we indeed compare the quantity @xmath232 at some scale @xmath233 such that @xmath234 to the horizon - scale amplitude of the linearized fluctuations @xmath235 , we once again find that the amplitude of the second order modes may still dominate over that of the linear modes assuming slow - roll .    as show in detail in the appendices",
    ", we find that we may write @xmath236 where @xmath237 , and that this in turn has the form @xmath238 where @xmath239 and where @xmath240 using all the above we can now finally see that the demand that @xmath241 , as described in figure 1 , is equivalent to @xmath242 given that @xmath243 , ( 73 ) implies e.g. that for @xmath244 the slow - roll condition must be violated .",
    "we see that the amplitude of the second order flucuations in our quantity @xmath245 dominates the corresponding linearized amplitude if the background spacetime is rolling slowly enough and @xmath246 is large enough , as it is in many models .",
    "note also the appearanec of the number of e - foldings @xmath247 , which indicates , as previously shown , that this effect is a cumulative effect which depends on the growth of the phase space of superhorizon modes .",
    "all in all , the violation of this inequality in such models casts doubt on the viability of the linearized approximation to those slowly rolling spacetimes .",
    "as we imply in the caption to figure 1 above , this calculation would ultimately contain formally divergent subhorizon contributions to @xmath139 , @xmath20 and it is this real phsyical effect of the coupling between subhorizon ( uv ) modes with superhubble ( ir ) modes that will reveal the observable importance of backreaction effects for local observers .",
    "the points we are making here are 1 ) the superhubble contribution , in this reasonable gauge , does take the approximate form of a cosmological constant contribution ; and 2 ) assuming the slow - roll condition in this gauge , within a wide class of initial conditions , is equivalent to assuming that ir backreactions dominate the linear terms . even if one uses the residual homogeneous gauge freedom , one can not simulataneously gauge away @xmath139 and @xmath20 .",
    "these results hold even if one considers backreaction onto some spatial scale @xmath248 of the second order modes .",
    "to summarize , we study the perturbations of the inflationary slow - roll spacetime which are at second order in the metric and matter fluctuations . we follow a procedure of consistently ( though probably not convergently ) expanding the einstein equations to second order and solving a subset of them assuming the zeroth and linear order equations hold .",
    "specifically , we solve the first and second order einstein constraint equations for the matter fluctuations , and in that way express our final expressions of @xmath139 and @xmath20 in terms of the metric fluctuations .",
    "we then solve a second order einstein to express all of our expressions in terms of quadratic combinations of linearized metric fluctuations .    in order to isolate the physical degrees of freedom in the second order fluctuations we use a longitudinal gauge - fixing procedure at second order .",
    "namely , we specify _ two _ independent infinitesimal , inhomogeneous , coordinate transformations ( gauges ) , one at linear order and one at second order , which admit no residual coordinate freedoms . within this coordinate system",
    "we evaluate the fluctuations of two independent background scalars formed from the stress energy and from them define the fluctuations , to second order , of the isotropic energy density @xmath16 and pressure @xmath20 .",
    "these fluctuations will not only arise from second order scalar modes but also from quadratic combinations of scalar - scalar and tensor - tensor modes at second order . whereas the nondecaying linear scalar and tensor modes are constants at these scales ( the vector modes die away ) , the nondecaying second order modes are time dependent and",
    "this leads to time - dependent @xmath139 and @xmath20 .",
    "we calculate @xmath139 and @xmath20 using the linearized and second order constraints and one second order scalar einstein equation .",
    "futhermore , given that we have three effective small parameters in this problem ( a slow - roll parameter , the strength of the metric and matter fluctuations , and the longwavelength approximation ( @xmath249 ) , we find that our @xmath139 and @xmath20 depend sensitively on the hierarchy of small parameters one assumes in the sense that ambiguous terms like @xmath250 appear in the mode expansion of @xmath16 , @xmath158 .",
    "for the ( incomplete ) case of just scalar - scalar backreactions and no genuinely second order metric or matter fluctuations , we find that @xmath22 but that @xmath21 in general",
    ". we find that the second order contributions to the energy density and pressure can , with the assumption of slow - roll , dominate over the second order linear contributions to the energy density and isotropic pressure given a broad range of slow - roll parameters .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the divergence of the enegy density or pressure perturbations as the slow - roll parameter goes to zero is certainly not physical , as our expressions ( say , equation ( 67 ) ) would seem to suggest .",
    "rather , if one thinks of a single set of einstein constraints expanded order by order ( as opposed to a tower of constraints ) then it may well be that second order terms in these constraints simply start to dominate the linear ones .",
    "we conclude that when one truly goes to second order and solves some of the einstein equations for the higher order classical fluctuations , they do approximately lead to a cosmological constant type of contribution in this gauge .",
    "furthermore , it seems that these higher order corrections dominate the linear terms if slow - roll holds in the background , suggesting the breakdown of the linearized approximation to within a small window of slow - roll parameters .",
    "some previous calculations of higer order superhorizon effects ( of which we are aware ) have used a procedure which effectively takes the expectation value of the gauge - fixed metric _ before _ forming some sort of ` invariant ` measure of the expansion with which to probe local ' backreaction , i.e. gauge fixing before taking the expectation value .",
    "such a procedure suffers from higher order gauge ambiguities , and at least for a model with massless , minimally coupled scalar with quartic self - interaction ( no gravity ) one can first form a desired invariant ' and then take expectation values and gauge fix this result ( see for example @xcite , and also @xcite ) .",
    "further investigations along this line will almost certainly prove useful , and one pay - off seems to be new ideas for observables in backreactions , such as recently described in @xcite .",
    "finally , as we indicated in the introduction , the procedure we use here does not say anything about what an observer would measure as the averaged cosmological constant in his own obserable patch of the universe .",
    "in other words , the suitably renormalized subhorizon contributions to @xmath20 and @xmath139 will allow a probe of the possibly crucial physics of the coupling of subhorizon and superhorizon modes in inflation and possibly shed some light on what we even mean by local modifications to a cosmological constant .",

    "this solution to equation ( 37 ) ( with the spatial gradient term restored ) is valid to within a couple of hubble times of the horizon exit , and during this time the variation of @xmath41 is negligible .",

    "the goal is to compare the magnitude of this term to the horizon - scale amplitude of the linearized fluctuations @xmath235 , as shown in appendix c.",
    "in order to derive inequalities ( 60 ) and ( 73 ) we must calculate the vev amplitude of the second order fluctuations at the homogeneous scale . we shall derive the result for some scale @xmath337 and then take the homogeneous limit to recover inequality ( 60 ) . using the results and notation of appendices a and b on the dominant ( scalar - scalar ) terms of equation ( 50 ) , one may write the averaged square of the dominant contributions to the second order ir pressure contribution ( or energy density , etc . ) as @xmath338 putting in the results from all of the above appendices we find that the dominant terms are of the form @xmath238 where @xmath339 it is important to note that the details of this calculation confirm that the naive guess ventured in the introduction holds : there are solutions of the diffeomorphism constraints of general relativity , at second order in perturbation theory about a slowly rolling background , which introduce a factor of @xmath340 into any expression of @xmath341 and @xmath245 , and these factors survive through quantum averaging .",
    "a second order gauge transformation can not eliminate the presence of such slow - roll enhanced terms .",
    "the central result of this paper is in comparing the amplitudes of the second order fluctuations at @xmath231 to the amplitudes linearized fluctuations at the horizon scale , @xmath342 . using equation ( c2 ) and equation ( 55 ) for this purpose , we see that @xmath343 is equivalent to demanding that @xmath344 where @xmath345 , @xmath346 .",
    "we can see that the spatial dependence is subdominant in the sense that it is multiplied by a lower power of @xmath326 : in other words , the homogeneous fluctuations ( mean ) are not , in the slow - roll limit , altered by the finite corrections which occur when one evaluated at the finite spatial scale of @xmath347 .",
    "we also note that ( c6 ) is positive definite , as it should be , since @xmath286 .",
    "furthermore we note that the first and second order dispersions above have the same weighting in volume normalization factors , so that they cancel .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath242 is the consistency condition for linearized theory at second order .",
    "in this section we comment that to second order in perturbation theory about pure de - sitter ( no - roll ) , the scalar sector is nontrivial .",
    "this can also be seen by e.g. examining the second order gauge fixing ( 45 ) in the main paper or the reduced equation of motion for @xmath149 , equation ( 48 ) , which shows that the tt sector will mix with and source a nontrivial scalar sector at second order when @xmath348 .",
    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing that the extra metric functions one can fix in flat , vacuum , spacetime and special spacetimes like de sitter are generic , but obey field equations .",
    "though they correspond to residual degrees of freedom specified only on an initial value surface , they are completely determined by equations of motion they _ also _ satisfy .",
    "therefore any residual gauge fixing makes crucial use of the equations of motion to set additional terms to zero via a gauge transformation .    to provide a formal alternate argument which however is far more compact and hopefully more convincing , consider the following . to linear order in perturbation theory about pure vacuum de - sitter it is relatively straightforward that one can gauge away the scalar sector .",
    "let us go through the proof and then broadly identify the impediment which would provent extending this procedure to second order .",
    "one may compactly prove this by writing by linearizing the linearized einstein equations about @xmath349,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields @xmath350 provided we choose the transverse lorentz gauge , i.e. @xmath351 & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one then asks if one can impose tracelessness as well , and it turns out that making the additional choice @xmath352 is both consistent with the imposition of the lorentz gauge ( d3 ) and also satisfies the field equations ( d2 ) .",
    "however , the imposition of the lorentz gauge along with tracelessness still leaves a residual gauge freedom in the form of gauge transformations which are harmonic functions of the operator @xmath353 , with which we can hope to eliminate @xmath354 .",
    "not only does it turn that such transformations are possible , but the field equations expressed in this new gauge ( combined with the maximal symmetry of de sitter ) also demand that @xmath355 . in the complete , closed , slicing ( d1 ) the fact that the lapse fluctuation @xmath356 is zero corresponds to the fact that the eigenfunctions of the laplacian on @xmath357 must be periodic ( or , in other words , their eigenspectrum must be discrete ) .",
    "in other words , a positivity argument shows that the linear lapse fluctuation can _ also _ be gauged away .",
    "thus tracelessness , transverseness , and the vanishing of the shift and lapse leaves two degrees of freedom , which are the two polarizations of the graviton .",
    "therefore , at linear order in perturbation theory , the scalar sector is trivial ( as is the vector  the proof is considerably simpler ) modulo a linear gauge transformation and only the tt sector remains , which to this order is gauge invariant anyway .    at second order , however , additional gravitational wave terms in tt - tt combinations ( which transform as scalars ) will act as sources for the scalar perturbations .",
    "these additional terms will enter as both negative definite and positive definite contributions because of the form of the perturbed christoffel symbols ( whose quadratic products and derivatives comprise the field equations ) , and this variable sign contribution is sufficient to in general get a nontrivial solution for the second order lapse . therefore it is not possible in general to gauge it away at second order if one also insists on gauging away the second order shifts , so the second order scalar sector is not a gauge artifact .",
