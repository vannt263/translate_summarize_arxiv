    "despite rapid progress on surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers)@xcite towards applications @xcite , many fundamental questions remain open .",
    "an important issue that has been the subject of controversy relates to whether the local enhanced electromagnetic ( em ) fields cause local heating and/or vibrational pumping .",
    "this is important for reasons that range from the purely practical ( damage to analytes under study ) to the more fundamental ( vibrational pumping ) . in certain cases ,",
    "plasmon - related heating effects may even be useful@xcite for biomedical applications , but both the magnitude of the effect and how to control it need proper characterization .",
    "it is possible to use the as / s ratio under sers conditions to study heating / pumping effects with certain limitations , as we discuss in detail below .    the laser power dependence of the as / s- ratio was thought to provide strong evidence for sers pumping @xcite , but this has been the source of controversy and alternative explanations have been offered@xcite .",
    "contributions to the as / s - ratio can be complex and include : heating , pumping , and resonance effects .",
    "there are various hints for heating in sers and the anomalous ratio ( commonly measured even at low powers ) was predicted to relate to hidden resonances in the system@xcite .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that it is indeed possible to use the as / s ratio to map out roughly the underlying resonance in certain cases@xcite .    here",
    "we develop the use of as / s - ratios further ; we expand and provide additional evidence to recent discussions in refs .",
    "we demonstrate how to separate heating from resonance effects through temperature @xmath0 dependent data .",
    "we find a temperature rise at low laser powers ( @xmath1 0.5 mw on a @xmath2 1.5 @xmath3 m ( diameter ) spot ) that depends on laser energy .",
    "we find evidence also suggesting the existence of mode specific vibrational pumping at higher laser power densities and low temperature .",
    "for the sake of clarity we shall repeat the essential details of the discussion presented in refs.@xcite keeping details to a minimum .",
    "we call @xmath4 the temperature of the local environment ( substrate + ambient surrounding the sample ) , while @xmath5 is room temperature , @xmath6 the temperature of the metal colloids , and @xmath7 the temperature of the molecule .",
    "the main possible scenarios are :    1 .   no heating .",
    "the whole system is in thermal equilibrium ; i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   global heating : system in thermal equilibrium at a @xmath9 higher than @xmath5 ; i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "3 .   local heating of substrate and analyte : when @xmath11 .",
    "the analyte is in thermal equilibrium with the metal , at a higher temperature than their environment .",
    "the source of heating here is mainly laser absorption in the metal substrate .",
    "4 .   local heating of analyte @xmath12 . here",
    "the molecule remains in internal thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath7 , higher than the rest of the system .",
    "strong interactions among vibrational modes within the molecule allows vibrational energy to thermalize and reach an equilibrium through intramolecular vibrational relaxation or redistribution ( ivr ) .",
    "the source of heating here can be direct laser absorption in the molecule ( via electronic state transitions ) , or vibrational pumping ( via sers processes ) followed by fast ivr . however , it is difficult to distinguish between these two possible causes .",
    "mode specific vibrational pumping , when the analyte is not in internal thermal equilibrium .",
    "each vibrational mode can be described by an effective mode temperature , @xmath13 , which reflects the population of its first vibrational excited state @xcite . in general",
    ", ivr ensures that @xmath13 is the same for all modes ( internal thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , sers processes affect the vibrational population and can pump vibrations from the ground to the first excited vibrational state ( for stokes processes ) .",
    "if for a given vibrational mode , the pumping rate becomes comparable or higher than the ivr rate , this mode can then have a higher effective temperature than the other modes : @xmath14 ; this is referred to as _ mode specific pumping_.    the different scenarios deserve a brief comment .",
    "if vibrational pumping occurs in the presence of fast ivr , pumping will only be observed as an effective heating of the molecule ( 4@xmath15 scenario ) . from the experimental point of view , under these circumstances , it would be impossible to distinguish this situation from the 3@xmath16 scenario .",
    "it is indeed very difficult to determine independently the temperature of the metal and the molecule , due to the lack of a spectroscopic feature coming explicitly from the metal . even if one could prove that the 4@xmath15 scenario was the correct one , it",
    "would then be extremely difficult to determine the real cause of heating : direct laser absorption or vibrational pumping , or a combination of both effects .",
    "consequently , the only clear - cut demonstration of vibrational pumping is , in our view , the last scenario ; i.e. mode specific pumping .",
    "heating and pumping under sers conditions have previously been investigated using peak parameter correlations , such as width or frequency vs. intensity@xcite .",
    "evidence was found for local heating ( 3@xmath16 or 4@xmath15 scenario ) but no evidence of mode specific pumping was uncovered @xcite .",
    "although yielding evidence for the existence of local heating , it was impossible to distinguish its origin ; i.e. either within the molecule itself or the colloid ( and consequently the molecule through its close contact with the metal ) . these previous results do not exclude the presence of pumping ( _ vide supra _ ) but they do not demonstrate it either .",
    "most other studies of heating / pumping under sers conditions @xcite have focused on the measurements of the as / s ratio , @xmath17 .",
    "this ratio is in principle directly related to the vibrational populations , and therefore to the effective mode temperature .",
    "however , in the case of sers , it can be modified by underlying resonances associated with the wavelength dependence of the sers enhancement factor , making the interpretations more difficult . the most general expression for the ratio under sers conditions at low powers ( in the absence of pumping ) and for molecules in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath7 ) is@xcite :    @xmath18    with @xmath19 ( accounting for the standard wavelength dependence of raman processes ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the intensity of the anti - stokes ( stokes ) raman mode , @xmath21 is the frequency of the laser ( raman mode ) , @xmath22 is the anti - stokes ( stokes ) scattering cross section of the molecule , @xmath23 is the number of active molecules , and @xmath24 is the sers enhancement factor at the molecule position at the anti - stokes(stokes ) frequency .",
    "the latter term includes both electromagnetic and chemical enhancement effects . in general the enhancement",
    "can be site dependent and therefore should be summed over all active sites . because anti - stokes signals are typically small , their measurement requires relatively long integration time and/or large analyte concentrations .",
    "the results are therefore an average over several active sites / molecules , each with different enhancement factors and resonances . to account for this averaging , @xmath17 for a given mode",
    "@xmath25 can be modelled in a first approximation as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average _ asymmetry factor _ from resonance effects ( asymmetries in cross sections ) , which can change from mode to mode .",
    "@xmath28 was used in this expression to account for the possibility of different effective mode temperatures . when the vibrational pumping rate is small compared to ivr rate , we have @xmath29 for all modes and the molecule is in thermal equilibrium at @xmath7 . however ,",
    "if vibrational pumping is not negligible , this expression needs to be modified to give ( for weak pumping ) @xcite : @xmath30   \\label{ratioati}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the vibrational relaxation time ( including ivr and other relaxation processes ) , and @xmath32 is the laser intensity in photons per unit time and surface area .",
    "we see in this latest expression that vibrational pumping would tend to increase the value of @xmath33 .",
    "this could alternatively be described by eq .",
    "( [ ratioat ] ) , using an effective mode temperature @xmath34 , but determining @xmath28 would require the use of eq .",
    "( [ ratioati ] ) .",
    "( [ ratioat ] ) or ( [ ratioati ] ) form the basis for the analysis of most sers experiments about heating / pumping that use as / s ratio measurements . from them , it is obvious that the measurement of @xmath33 only is not sufficient to extract @xmath7 or @xmath28 , as the @xmath27 s are unknown .",
    "one therefore needs an extra free parameter . in previous works ,",
    "the power dependence of @xmath33 was for example studied @xcite .",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath33 with @xmath32 has been invoked as evidence of vibrational pumping which would appear to follow from eq .",
    "( [ ratioati ] ) .",
    "this is not true however and direct heating of the molecule has been proposed as an alternative explanation @xcite . to understand the effect of heating on @xmath17 , one can write @xmath35 , and expand eq .",
    "( [ ratioat ] ) considering a small temperature increase , @xmath36 : @xmath37 if heating effects are present , @xmath38 changes with power . because heat diffusion and transfer models are linear , it is reasonable to assume that the temperature increase @xmath38 is proportional to laser power : @xmath39 . for a small temperature increase , the argument in the second exponential of eq .",
    "( [ ratioheating ] ) is small and expanding it leads to @xmath40 the linear dependence of @xmath33 ( or quadratic dependence of @xmath41 ) with incident power can therefore equally be the result of conventional heating effects or of pumping .",
    "it is also worth noting that the argument in the second exponential of eq .",
    "( [ ratioheating ] ) can be comparable to 1 , even for a small @xmath38 . this can be the case for example for high energy modes , where @xmath42 can be @xmath1 10 .",
    "the power dependence of @xmath33 as a result of heating effects would then be exponential .",
    "such power dependence , linear for low energy modes , and exponential for high energy modes , has already been observed @xcite .",
    "this shows that heating effects can be important and that a linear power dependence of @xmath33 is not in itself a proof of vibrational pumping .    instead of using the laser power as an additional parameter",
    ", we propose to study the as / s ratios of each mode as a function of substrate temperature @xmath43 . as we shall show , by investigating how these ratios change as a function of @xmath9 over a wide range , we can separate the contributions due to heating and resonance effects .",
    "in addition , this approach enables us to detect a departure from internal thermal equilibrium of the molecule , i.e. vibrational pumping .",
    "silver colloids were produced as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "sers samples were prepared by mixing equal amounts of colloidal and 25 mm kcl solutions together , to which 1 @xmath3l of 10@xmath44 m rhodamine 6 g",
    "( rh6 g ) solution was added , resulting in a 10@xmath45 m rh6 g concentration .",
    "the sample was then dried onto a si substrate .",
    "the temperature calibration in terms of as / s - data of non - sers active signals ( paracetamol ) is described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "measurements were carried out with a renishaw 2000 ccd spectrometer and an olympus bh-2 microscope with a linkham temperature stage , using both 514 nm ar@xmath46 ion and 633 nm hene lasers with a @xmath4750 long working distance objective ( @xmath21.5 @xmath3 m beam diameter at the focal point ) .",

    "the study of the @xmath9-dependence of the function @xmath70 therefore provide additional evidence that the behavior of the 1510 @xmath48 below 200k is a manifestation of vibrational pumping in this mode .",
    "this effect is more prominent at low @xmath9 and for higher energy modes because the equilibrium population of the excited vibrational state is then very small and the relative change in intensity is larger . following this argument",

    "@xmath108 for high powers using the 633 nm laser , an overall shared @xmath38 among the modes is not possible and one is forced to a better quality fit by allowing different effective temperatures for different modes . using the function @xmath70 , one can then demonstrate that this is the result of vibrational pumping in the 1510 @xmath48 mode .",
    "in closing , we have observed a laser frequency dependent heating of the order of 25 k at low laser power under sers conditions with 633 nm excitation .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to decouple in dry samples the contributions of the thermal population and resonances in the as / s ratios by performing a @xmath9-scan , thus overcoming the basic uncertainty in the different relative contributions which exist in studies at a single @xmath9 .",
    "most importantly we have used this technique to provide evidence for at least two possible scenarios : molecule in thermal equilibrium at low powers and mode specific pumping at high powers .",
    "experiments at lower temperatures are in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
