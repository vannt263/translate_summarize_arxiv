    "at `` punctual '' space scale ( @xmath050 cm^2^ ) rain can be described by a stochastic sequence of couples @xmath1 : @xmath2 being the diameter of the @xmath3-th drops , and @xmath4 the interval of time between the arrival of the @xmath3-th drop and the @xmath5-th drop ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "partitioning the time axis in sampling time intervals of equal duration it is possible to build from the sequence @xmath1 the sequence @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the probability density function of drop diameter , and @xmath9 the number of drops observed at the ground during the @xmath10-th sampling time interval ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these two last quantities are usually measured by disdrometers with a sampling time in the range 10s-5min .",
    "observational evidences suggest that rain is a non - homogeneous process as the variability observed in the sequence @xmath12 can not simply ascribed to the variability expected when sampling from a single stochastic process @xcite .",
    "the sequence @xmath1 , and thus @xmath12 , is non - stationary : the `` statistical rules '' to which the couples @xmath1 obey are not invariant under time translation @xcite .",
    "a proper description of the distribution of drop sizes , which is fundamental for understanding the microphysics involved in the mechanisms of precipitation formation and retrieving rainfall from radar sensors , has been the main research goal since the introduction of the impact disdrometer has made reliable and prolonged measurements of drop diameters feasible .",
    "the main tool the meteorological community uses to describe the variability of the rainfall phenomenon is the drop size distribution , namely the concentration @xmath13 per unit volume and diameter . in their seminal work marshall and palmer @xcite proposed the exponential as functional dependence for @xmath13 with a decaying constant depending on the rainfall rate .",
    "later , joss and gori @xcite made clear that the exponential form is the results of sampling long time intervals ( @xmath030 minutes ) , and at smaller time intervals ( @xmath01 minute ) the drop size distribution does not have an exponential functional dependence .",
    "ulbrich @xcite proposed the gamma distribution as the functional form for the drop size distributions sampled at short time intervals .",
    "the rationale for this choice is that while an exponential decay is observed for the right tail of the distribution ( recently @xcite have shown that break - up due to air viscosity is the main mechanism underlying the occurrence of exponential right tail ) , the density at smaller diameters is smaller than that of an exponential distribution .",
    "the gamma distribution has been the only choice adopted in literature ( if one excludes sporadic attempts with the log - normal distribution , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) mainly because of two properties : 1 ) it is defined by two parameters , and 2 ) its moments can easily calculated so that any rain bulk variable can easily expressed in terms of the parameters of the gamma distribution .",
    "the gamma distribution has been widely accepted by radar meteorology and cloud physics communities , even if measurements show that the gamma distribution is not general enough to represent adequately the full range of the sample variability , @xcite .",
    "the fit accuracy of the gamma distribution to disdrometer data has not been properly addressed ( aside from subjective statements : `` a good fit '' or `` a reasonable fit '' not supported by any objective measurement ) or mistakenly addressed ( see section [ sec : results ] ) as in @xcite . in the present work , we consider data from 10 different sites , and use the kolmogorov - smirnov goodness of fit test ( e.g. @xcite ) to show that the gamma distribution is a poor fit to 1 minute sampled drop size distribution .    to obviate to this inadequacy , we propose a parametrization of the drop size distribution based on a standard procedure in statistical science : the description of an unknown probability density function in terms of its mean @xmath14 , standard deviation @xmath15 , skewness @xmath16 , and kurtosis @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we show that mean , standard deviation and skewness are the minimum number of parameters , which effectively describe the drop size distributions .",
    "these parameters , together with the drop count @xmath18 , are the variables necessary to describe the rainfall phenomenon at a punctual scale in space and at short time scales .",
    "all bulk variables of interest can be derived by the 4-tuple of parameters @xmath19 . adopting the jargon of the scientific community studying dynamical systems",
    ", we refer to the four dimensional cartesian product @xmath20 spanned by the 4-tuple @xmath19 as the rainfall phase space .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we discuss the data used in our analysis , section [ sec : methods ] we illustrate all the methods of analysis adopted .",
    "section [ sec : results ] reports our results , and section [ sec : conclusions ] our conclusions .",
    "we consider joss - waldvogel disdrometer data sampled at 1 minute time intervals from ten different locations on earth s surface .",
    "table 1 gives the list of the locations with a three letter code used to reference the site in the figures .",
    "in addition , the kppen - geiger climate classification ( @xcite ) of each site is provided .",
    "table 2 completes the description of the data sets providing for each site the latitude , longitude , altitude , together with number of minutes and drops considered in the analysis .",
    "all data are processed as follows .",
    "we consider for each data base only minutes for which the drop count is @xmath2160 ( drop arrival rate @xmath01 per second ) .",
    "the rationale for this choice is twofold : a ) it guarantees a minimum reasonable accuracy for the estimation of the probability density function @xmath22 , and the other statistical parameters ( mean , standard deviation , ... ) .",
    "b ) it excludes time intervals of observation which are quiescent ( sparse precipitation ) whose contribution to the total cumulated precipitated volume is negligible ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "after this first filtering , we eliminate from the remaining minutes of observation any outlier drop count . for each minute",
    ", we find the disdrometer class with the maximum probability density , and we calculate the central continuous non - zero span of the probability density : the set of contiguous disdrometer classes with non zero counts and which includes the class with maximum density .",
    "the counts in all disdrometer classes which do not belong to the central continuous non - zero span are considered as outliers and are discarded : e.g. the disdrometer count ( 3,11,18,31,30,35,80,52,41,39,44,21,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0 ) has an outlier in the 15-th class which is disregarded leading to the count ( 3,11,18,31,30,35,80,52,41,39,44,21 , + 5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ) .",
    "the removal of outliers drop counts improves the estimate of higher moments of the probability density function @xmath22 .",
    "a detailed discussion on outliers and their effects on estimated statistical parameters can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now describe the methods used to quantify the variability of the rainfall phenomenon .",
    "two equivalent descriptions are possible for the variability of drop diameters .",
    "1 ) the drop size distribution defined as the concentration per unit volume and unit diameter @xmath13    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the number of drops per unit volume and @xmath25 is the probability density function of drop diameter in the unit volume .",
    "2 ) the flux - equivalent of eq.([eq : nd_proper ] ) : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath18 is the number of drops observed at the ground , and @xmath22 is the probability density function of drop diameter at the ground .",
    "the two descriptions are equivalent as    @xmath28    and    @xmath29    in the above equations , @xmath30 is the time interval of observation ( in seconds ) , @xmath31 the capture area of the instrument ( in m^2^ ) , and @xmath32 the drop velocity of diameter @xmath33 ( in m / s ) .",
    "usually it is assumed that the arrival velocity of drops is equal to their limit velocity and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 m/(s mm^0.67^ ) and @xmath36 ( @xcite ) . with these definitions    @xmath37    by use of eq.([eq : cloud - ground-2 ] ) , we can connect the moments @xmath38 of the probability density function observed at the ground with those of the concentration per unit volume @xmath39 :    @xmath40    using the above equation one is able to derive expressions for any rain bulk variable .",
    "e.g. the rainfall rate @xmath41 ( in mm / h ) is    @xmath42    the concentration per unit volume ,",
    "eq.([eq : nd_proper ] ) is by far the most common quantitiy in literature , even if measurements of drop sizes at the ground are by large the only available data .",
    "hereby , we adopt the probability density of drop diameter at the ground , eq.([eq : ground - cloud ] ) , as measured by disdrometer counts .      the most common functional form adopted for the probability density function @xmath25 in eq.([eq : nd_proper ] ) is the gamma distribution    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the shape,@xmath45 the inverse scale parameter , and @xmath46 is gamma function .",
    "consequently the statistical moment of order @xmath47 of the drop size distribution @xmath13 is    @xmath48    however , it is common practice , in literature , to write eqs.([eq : nd_proper ] ) and ( [ eq : defgamma ] ) as    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is defined as    @xmath51    with the above notation    @xmath52    finally , if the probability density function @xmath25 is a gamma distribution , then also the probability density at the ground @xmath22 is a gamma distribution    @xmath53      we briefly review the two main methods which have been adopted in literature to obtain the three parameters @xmath54 in eqs.([eq : nd_proper ] ) and ( [ eq : defgamma ] ) .",
    "the method of moments ( mm ) uses the moments of the observed distribution to derive the parameters of the desired fitting function . for a drop size distribution with a gamma distribution for diameter density ,",
    "the mm@xmath55 method finds the number of drops per unit volume @xmath24 , the scale @xmath44 and shape @xmath45 such that the resulting distribution @xmath13 exactly matches the moments of order n1 , n2 and n3 of the observed distribution .",
    "hereby , we use the mm@xmath56 and mm@xmath57 procedures as they are the ones usually adopted in literature ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , together with the mm@xmath58 adopted by @xcite .",
    "this last procedure finds the concentration @xmath24 , the scale @xmath44 and shape @xmath45 of the drop size distribution @xmath13 matching the observed number of drops at the ground @xmath18 ( moment 0.67 ) , the observed average drop diameter at the ground @xmath14 ( moment 1.67 ) , and the observed second moment of drop diameter at the ground @xmath59 ( moment 2.67 ) .",
    "note that the last two conditions imply that the resulting drop size distribution matches the standard deviation of drop diameter @xmath15 observed at the ground .",
    "therefore , we will use for brevity the notation mm@xmath60 instead of mm@xmath58 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nd_proper ] ) and ( [ eq : momentsgamma ] ) , the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath45 , and @xmath44 are    @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63      the method of maximum likelihood is the main alternative to the method of moments .",
    "let @xmath64 be the probability density function of the variable @xmath65 given the vector of parameters @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is a sample of size @xmath18 .",
    "the likelihood @xmath68 that the sample @xmath69 is drawn from the distribution @xmath64 is defined as @xmath70 . in practice it is more convenient to deal with the logarithm of the likelihood , denominated the log - likelihood @xmath71 , or the average log - likelihood @xmath72 .",
    "the ml method makes an estimation of @xmath73 maximizing the average log - likelihood , i.e. @xmath74 $ ] , @xcite .",
    "dealing with disdrometer data , it is important to recall that disdrometers collect drops with a diameter @xmath75 mm ( for the jw disdrometer ) , making a lower truncation in the sample distribution . in the absence of small drops in sample datasets ,",
    "the method of maximum likelihood ignoring this problem exhibits large bias which do not decrease increasing the sample size , @xcite .",
    "consequently , modifications to the mml are necessary to deal explicitly situations where lower truncations to the samples are present",
    ". we will consider the lower truncated gamma distribution which density is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the incomplete gamma function calculated in @xmath78 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the average log - likelihood is @xmath79 the estimates of @xmath45 and @xmath44 are obtained numerically minimizing the function @xmath80 , using the r code provided by @xcite in their appendix .      under some general condition ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", a probability density function is completely determined by its moments : given the sequence of moments @xmath81 , @xmath82 there exists an unique @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "this fact has lead to the moment - characterization , in statistical sciences , of probability density function for which a known parametric form is not available . for this purpose",
    "a suitable number of moments and/or function of moments will provide information on the unknown probability density function @xmath83 and , as a consequence , on the dynamical process driving the realizations of the stochastic variable @xmath85 .",
    "we refer to these parameters as the _ statistical descriptors _ of the probability density function .    the two most commonly used statistical descriptors are the mean @xmath86 , and the standard deviation @xmath87 .",
    "in addition to these two parameters , the skewness @xmath16 , measuring the asymmetry of the distribution , and the kurtosis @xmath17 , measuring the peakedness of the distribution , are used .",
    "skewness and kurtosis are the third and the fourth standardized central moments ( the expectation value of @xmath88^{3}$ ] and @xmath88^{4}$ ] ) and can be written in terms of the moments of the distribution as follows : @xmath89^{3/2}}\\label{eq : skewness-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath90^{2}}.\\label{eq : kurtosis-1}\\ ] ]    higher standardized moments do not have a particular name and are generally not used since the higher the moment the larger are the inaccuracies of any estimate .",
    "however , hereby we will make use of the fifth standardized central moment , the expectation values of @xmath88^{5}$ ] , which will denote with the letter @xmath91 @xmath92^{5/2}}.\\label{eq:5th - central - moment}\\ ] ] mean , standard deviation , skewness , and kurtosis are sufficient to achieve a satisfactory ( albeit not full ) description of any probability density function of interest . in many cases they are redundant as some of the statistical descriptors are shown to be function of the others .",
    "for example if @xmath93 then only two elements of the 4-tuple @xmath94 are independent .",
    "this redundancy also occurs for rainfall as we will show in section [ sec : results ] .      for a dynamical system ,",
    "the term `` phase space '' indicates the cartesian product @xmath95 of the @xmath96 variables necessary to describe the system .",
    "note that the cardinality @xmath97 of a dynamical system is always larger or equal to its degrees of freedom . to describe the motion a point particle of mass @xmath98 in one dimension",
    "we need its position @xmath85 and its quantity of motion @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , with @xmath101velocity ) . in this case",
    "the phase space is the @xmath102 plane ( @xmath103 ) , and at each time @xmath104 the state of the particle is associated to a point in the @xmath102 plane .",
    "the time evolution of a dynamical system is described by the time evolution ( trajectory ) of its associated point in the phase space .    in the case of the rainfall phenomenon ,",
    "the variables of interest are bulk variables ( e.g rainfall rate , reflectivity ) , which implies a `` summation '' over the number of drops in a given interval of time .",
    "all the bulk variables are functions of either the couple @xmath105 , if one uses the concentration per unit volume , or the couple @xmath106 , if one uses the flux - equivalent description . if the probability density function at the ground @xmath22 ( or that in a unitary volume @xmath25 ) has a parametric description : @xmath107 in term of @xmath98 parameters , then we define the phase space of rainfall as the cartesian product @xmath108 spanned by ( @xmath98 + 1)-tuple @xmath109 .",
    "e.g. , if we consider the concentration @xmath13 and assume a gamma distribution for the probability density function @xmath25 in eq.([eq : nd_proper ] ) , the rainfall phase space is @xmath110 spanned by the 3-tuple @xmath54 . hereby , we do not impose any particular functional form on the function @xmath22 ( and thus @xmath25 ) .",
    "we show ( section [ sec : results ] ) that the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are sufficient to describe the variability of the probability density function at the ground @xmath111 therefore the cartesian product @xmath20 spanned by the 4-tuple @xmath19 can be considered as the rainfall phase space .",
    "any bulk variable @xmath112 can be written as function of the phase space parameters @xmath113 . in the case of the rainfall rate @xmath41 ( expressed in mm / h )",
    "@xmath114.\\label{eq : r_mitica}\\ ] ]    this equation states that the set of observation time intervals ( 1 minute in our case ) with equal rainfall rate @xmath41 is a three dimensional manifold in the phase space .      the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) goodness - of - fit test is a non - parametric test used to check if a sequence of random samples can be considered as a realization of a stochastic process with a given cumulative distribution function @xmath115 . the test compares the hypothetical @xmath116 with the cumulative frequency @xmath117 , where @xmath118 for @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the i - th order statistics , and @xmath121 .",
    "the k - s uses as test statistic the maximum difference @xmath122 .",
    "if no parameter in @xmath116 is determined from data , then @xmath123 has a distribution which is independent by @xmath116 .",
    "thus the critical value of @xmath123 for a significance level of @xmath124 and for large samples , @xmath125 , is @xmath126 , and reported in all statistical textbooks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "contrary , if the parameters of @xmath116 are estimated , then the distribution of @xmath123 is dependent on @xmath116 , and the critical value of @xmath123 must be re - calculated , e.g. via montecarlo simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the critical value of @xmath123 re - calculated is always smaller than the value corresponding to the canonical case where it is assumed that `` no parameter in @xmath116 is determined from data '' .",
    "disdrometer data report the occurrence of a drop in a given range of diameter values ( diameter class ) and not an `` exact '' diameter value which is needed to perform the kolmogrov - smirnov test . to bypass this limitation",
    "we assign to a drop in the j - th diameter class a random value selected uniformly in the range defined by the class itself .",
    "all the results reported in this section refer to probability density function observed at the ground @xmath22 .",
    "similar results can be obtained for the concentration per unit volume and diameter @xmath13 since the two distribution are connected via eq.([eq : ground - cloud ] ) .",
    "the method of the moments mm@xmath55 for the gamma distribution finds the number of drops per unit volume @xmath24 , the scale @xmath44 and shape @xmath45 such that the fitting concentration per unit volume and unit diameter exactly matches the moments of order n1 , n2 and n3 of the observed concentration per unit volume and unit diameter @xmath13 . none of the mm@xmath57 , mm@xmath56 , and mm@xmath60 methods exactly match the moment 3.67 , so that the `` reproducibility '' of the rainfall rate ( observed versus the one derived from the fitted parameters ) has been considered as a `` measure '' of fit goodness : e.g. ( @xcite ) and @xcite ) .",
    "hereby , we show that accuracy with which the mm@xmath55 method reproduces the @xmath3-th moment of the concentration @xmath13 can not be taken as a measure of fit goodness as the accuracy depends on the separation between @xmath3 and the orders @xmath127,@xmath128,@xmath129 and not just on the particular functional form chosen .",
    "let us consider the mm@xmath56 method .",
    "the fitting distribution by construction matches the third , fourth and sixth moment of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the 3.67-th moment of the fitting @xmath13 ( the rainfall rate ) is close to the observed value : the middle - left panel of figure 1 indicates the relative error @xmath130 is bounded in the range -0.5%,0.5% .",
    "however , instead of a gamma distribution for the functional form of @xmath25 , one could use any other distribution with two parameters ( e.g. gaussian , lognormal , beta ) and obtain similar accuracies .",
    "what about the number of drops observed at the ground @xmath18 ( the 0.67-th moment of @xmath131 ? as shown in the middle - right panel of figure 1 , the agreement is not so good as relative error of the order of @xmath13225% are possible .",
    "next , we consider the mm@xmath60 method .",
    "it reproduces the rainfall rate reasonably well , relative error bounded in the -5%,5% range ( upper - left panel of figure 1 ) , but poorly reproduces the reflectivity @xmath133 ( the sixth moment of @xmath13 ) as relative errors larger than @xmath13225% are not so uncommon ( upper - right panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , the mm@xmath134 method reproduces with the same accuracy of the mm@xmath135 method ( extremely well ) the rainfall rate , the relative error is bounded in the range -0.5%,0.5% ( bottom left panel of figure 1 ) , but is better than the mm@xmath135 method with respect the drop count @xmath18 ( 2 is closer to 0.67 than 3 ) , relative error in the range -15%,15% ( bottom right panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 suggests that the gamma distribution , as convenient and as parsimonious it may be , is not a satisfactory functional form for the drop size distribution . to prove this point we use a proper measure of goodness - of - fit , such as the kolmogorov - smirnov test , and what is considered to be the best fitting procedure , the mml method . in table 2 , we report the percentage of acceptance ( acp ) and rejection ( rjc ) of the lower truncated gamma distribution with parameters estimated using the mml , using the kolmogorov - smirnov goodness - of - fit test with a 5% level of significance to each minute of the drw data ( 6863 ) . in columns 2 and 3 , the percentages are calculated using as 5% critical value @xmath126 , the classical value reported in all statistical textbooks ( e.g. @xcite ) assuming that no parameters of the gamma distribution are estimated . in columns 4 and 5",
    "the critical value is determined via montecarlo simulations taking into account the fact that the parameters are estimated via the mml from data . the first row ( all )",
    "reports the fraction of the total number of minutes in the drw data sets for which the gamma distribution can be considered a good fit .",
    "the percentage of acceptance passes from 71% to 45% when one takes in proper consideration that the parameters of the distribution are obtained from the sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining rows report the percentage of acceptance and rejection for subsets obtained using as thresholds the percentiles of the distribution of number of drops @xmath18 per minute : 5%- , 25%- , 50%- , 75%- , 95%-percentile .",
    "e.g. the second row reports the results for the subsets with number of drops smaller than the 5%-percentile ( @xmath136 in our case ) : minutes with a small sample size . on the other hand ,",
    "the last row reports the results for the subsets with number of drops larger than or equal to the 95%-percentile ( @xmath137 in our case ) : minutes with a large sample size .",
    "we see that when we move to subsets of minutes with large drop counts the percentage of acceptance ( rejection ) diminishes ( increases ) .    in summary , if we consider the entire drw data set , we are confident ( at the 95% level ) that the gamma distribution can be a proper fit for probability density function @xmath22 only for 45% of 1 minute sampling time intervals .",
    "more disturbingly the percentage of rejection increases as the sample size increases .",
    "note that test like the kolmogorov - smirnov should be administered to sample with a size of at least @xmath0100 ( @xcite ) to have of any significance ( in other words if the sample size is very small the effect of random fluctuations is large enough that almost any tested distribution will pass the test ) .",
    "results for the other nine data sets ( no reported here for brevity ) are similar to that of darwin . on the ground of these results , we reject the gamma distribution as a proper fit for drop size distributions .",
    "we show that the value of standardized central moments of order @xmath214 are strictly dependent from than the third one ( skewness ) .",
    "in particular we study the dependence on the skewness @xmath16 of the fourth standardized central moment ( kurtosis @xmath17 ) and the fifth one denoted by the symbol @xmath91 . as a consequence ,",
    "mean ( @xmath14 ) , standard deviation ( @xmath15 ) , and skewness ( @xmath16 ) provide a satisfactory description of the variability of the probability density function @xmath22 and therefore the 4-tuple @xmath19 can be considered as the rainfall phase space .      to examine the dependence of the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath91 on @xmath16",
    ", we calculate for each data set the median , 5%- , and 95%-percentile of the observed values of @xmath17 and @xmath91 for a given value of @xmath16 ( in practice this is accomplished dividing each data sets in subsets with `` equal '' ( @xmath138 ) value of skewness ) .",
    "the results are reported in figure 2 .",
    "the median values are depicted with solid lines of different colors one for each dataset .",
    "we also calculate , merging all the datasets , the 5% and 95% percentile for any given range value of the skewness if at least 100 samples ( 1 minute time interval of observation ) are present .",
    "the range between the 5% and 95% percentile is shaded in gray in the figure .",
    "we see how in both cases ( @xmath91 vs @xmath16 , central panel and @xmath17 vs @xmath16 lower panel ) the median lines are independent from the site chosen .",
    "the discrepancies observed for values of skewness larger than @xmath02.56 are mostly due to lack of statistics as shown in the upper panel of figure 2 , where we plot the number of sample @xmath139 for each range value of the skewness .",
    "figure 2 shows that mean @xmath140 standard deviation @xmath15 and skewness @xmath16 are effective statistical descriptors for the probability density function of drop diameters at the ground @xmath22 .",
    "next , we show that these three parameters are not independent .",
    "we divide the range of value of the skewness in intervals of length 0.64 ( [ -1.60,-0.96], ... ,[2.88,3.52 ] as in @xcite ) , and the values of the mean diameter @xmath14 as follows : [ 0.3,0.4 ] , [ 0.4,0.5 ] , [ 0.5,0.6 ] , [ 0.7,0.8 ] , [ 0.9,1 ] , [ 1,1.2 ] , [ 1.2,1.4 ] , [ 1.4,1.6 ] , [ 1.6,1.8 ] , [ 1.8,2.0 ] , [ 2.0,2.5 ] , and [ 2.5,3 ] ( indicated by the vertical dashed lines in figure 3 ) . the rationale for these choices is to have inside each range of skewness and mean a `` reasonable '' number ( > 10 ) of 1 minute interval observations to calculate the median value of the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the results are reported in figure 3 .",
    "we see how for value of the mean diameter less than 1 mm the median curves are approximatively linear and do not depend on the site of observation . in this case , the site average angular coefficient and average intercept are reported at the bottom right of each panel , if at least the median from 5 sites was available .",
    "we see how the slope ( intercept ) increases ( decreases ) with increasingly larger value of the skewness until a sort of plateau is reached for the skewness ranges @xmath141 $ ] and @xmath142 $ ] after which the slope decreases ( intercept increases ) again . for values of the mean diameter larger than 1",
    "the median curves depend on the particular site of observation .",
    "however , the median curve is also estimated from a smaller number of samples ( in the range10 - 100 ) .",
    "thus , with the present data , we can not judge if the discrepancies between sites for the median curve ( in the range @xmath143 ) are real properties of the rainfall phenomenon or merely artifacts due to the poor statistical sampling available .    in summary ,",
    "if @xmath14 is in the interval [ 0.3,1 ] then @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the intercept and @xmath146 the slope .",
    "note that if the gamma distribution was indeed an extremely accurate fit to probability density function of drop diameter at the ground p(d ) then @xmath147 which is not supported by the experimental evidences depicted in figure 3 .",
    "eq.([eq : musigmagamma ] ) suggests that only two parameters of the triplets @xmath148 are necessary to describe the probability density @xmath22 of drop diameters at the ground .",
    "thus one could define the rainfall phase space as a tridimensional space : e.g. the cartesian product of the 3-tuple @xmath149 .",
    "however , longer data sets are necessary to effectively estimate the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and to explore the relationship @xmath152 in the range @xmath143 mm .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of this manuscript , we conservatively consider @xmath20 defined by the 4-tuple @xmath19 as the rainfall phase space .",
    "to each 1 minute time interval of observation is associated the point of coordinates ( @xmath153 ) in the phase space .",
    "the entire data set occupies a volume in @xmath20 . to visualize this volume",
    ", we need to consider the six 2d projections : @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 ( we use @xmath160 instead of @xmath18 for better visualization ) . given a data set ,",
    "we calculate the density of points in the phase space for all six 2d projections .",
    "ten separate figures ( one for each data set ) would be necessary to illustrate the results .",
    "to obviate to this difficulty and give an idea to the reader of the differences / similarities between data sets we adopted the concept of average bounding perimeter .",
    "for all 2d projections we calculate the center of mass of the phase space points ( each point has the same mass ) . with the center of mass as fixed point we span with an 10^o^ angle step the plane of the 2d projection .",
    "for each 10^o^ cone we calculate the average distance from the center of mass of the points within the cone .",
    "the connection with a continuous line of all average distance creates the average bounding perimeter which is a `` measurement '' of the volume of the phase space occupied by the database .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the plots on the @xmath157 projection plane show how the average bounding perimeters reflect the linear relationship between mean drop diameter and standard deviation of drop diameter depicted in figure 3 .",
    "the plots on the @xmath154 plane projection indicate that large value of counts ( @xmath161 ) are reached ( on average ) only for values of the mean drop diameter which are small ( @xmath14 in the range 0.4 - 0.7 mm ) or large ( @xmath162 . the first case , many drops with small diameter , is a common feature of orographic precipitation as shown ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . the bby and czc data sets are the same ones used in ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) while bao data set come from an instrument located at 1,577 m asml .",
    "the second case , many drops with possibly large diameters , is typical of strong convective events .",
    "the drw data sets ( rain of monsoonic origin ) and the mik ( small island at the equator ) and bkt ( another equatorial site ) are the data sets , among those considered , where the combination of large number of drops and large drop diameters occur more frequently on average .",
    "the average bounding perimeter on the @xmath158 plane projection show that a decrease in value of the mean drop diameter is linked to a raise of the skewness value , although this may be in part an effect of the limitation of the instrument ( joss - waldvogel impact disdrometer ) which is not capable of detecting drop diameters smaller than 0.3 mm ( reducing the contribution of left tails of @xmath22 to the skewness ) . due to the approximate linear relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , results of projection on planes",
    "for which one of the axis is the standard deviation @xmath15 are similar to those for which axis is substituted by the mean @xmath14 . if we consider the result on the @xmath156 plane projection , we see how these two variable are quite uncorrelated as the shape of the average bounding perimeters do not suggest any particular relation .",
    "the rainfall rate @xmath41 aside from a multiplicative constant is the sum of three factors ( eq.[eq : r_mitica ] ) : @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 .",
    "each factor accounts for a fraction @xmath166 $ ] ( negative values are possible only for the factor @xmath165 ) of the rainfall rate .",
    "we calculate @xmath47 for each factor and each 1 minute time interval of observation .",
    "then we calculate the probability @xmath167 that the fraction does not exceed @xmath47 .",
    "the results for each data base and each factor are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the @xmath167 curves are quite independent from the particular site .",
    "we see how the factor @xmath163 contributes the most to the rainfall rate with a median contribution @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) which is in the range 0.7 - 0.75 .",
    "the second largest contribution comes from the factor @xmath164 , @xmath168 in the range 0.2 - 0.25 , while the factor @xmath165 accounts for the smallest contribution : @xmath168 in the range 0.025 - 0.05 .",
    "these results can be explained noticing that at all sites and for all time interval of observation : 1 ) @xmath170 , and 2 ) @xmath171 .",
    "so that @xmath172 is almost always smaller than @xmath173 , and while @xmath16 can be larger ( in absolute value ) than @xmath14 , @xmath174 is always smaller than @xmath173 in virtue of 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "when an objective measure of fit goodness is adopted , the gamma distribution provides a poor fit to the drop size distribution sampled at short time scale ( 1 minute in our case ) at all the ten sites considered .",
    "it is the opinion of the authors that only an objective criterion of fit goodness ( e.g. kolmogorov - smirnov ) should guide the choice of a particular functional form for the concentration @xmath13 and/or the probability density function at the ground @xmath22 .",
    "for this reason we reject the gamma distribution as a proper parametrization of the rainfall phenomenon .",
    "we propose an alternative parametrization based on the common statistical procedure of describing an unknown probability density function in term of its standardized central moments .",
    "we show that the 4-tuple of parameters @xmath19 is sufficient to describe the observed variability of disdrometer counts for all the ten sites considered , and refer to the cartesian product of 4-tuple @xmath19 as the rainfall phase space .",
    "the volumes in the phase space relative to each data base ( figure 4 ) have some common features and some discrepancies which reflect different synoptic conditions and/or mechanisms of drop productions at play at the different site considered .",
    "however some results remarkably independent from the site considered : 1 ) standardized central moments of order @xmath175 have strong deterministic relationship with the third standardized moment : the skewness .",
    "2 ) mean @xmath14 , standard deviation @xmath15 , and skewness @xmath16 are related to each other via eq.([eq : musigmagamma ] ) with values of the slope @xmath151 and intercept @xmath150 which are not compatible with a gamma distribution functional dependence .",
    "finally , bulk variables of the rainfall can be written as a function of 4-tuple @xmath19 .",
    "e.g. eq.([eq : r_mitica ] ) for the rainfall rate @xmath41 .",
    "bulk variables , such as the liquid water content @xmath176 and the reflectivity @xmath133 are proportional to fractional moments ( 2.33 and 5.33 respectively ) of the probability density function of drop diameter at the ground @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , analytical expressions for the variables @xmath176 ans @xmath133 in terms of the 4-tuple @xmath177 are necessarily approximations , on the contrary the gamma distribution approximation leads to exact analytical expression .",
    "however , the main result of this paper is that any approximated expression , obtained via the proposed parametrization , is physically meaningful while any exact expression , obtained via the gamma distribution parametrization , is not .",
