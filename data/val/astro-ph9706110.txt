    "the be / x - ray binary systems represent the largest subclass of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb s ) .",
    "these systems consist of a compact object ( usually a neutron star ) in a wide eccentric orbit with a be star .",
    "a be star is defined to be an early type luminosity class iii - v star , which has at some time shown emission in the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "the balmer emission , along with a significant infrared excess is believed to originate in the circumstellar material surrounding the be star , probably in the form of an equatorial disc .",
    "the x - ray emission in these systems is the result of accretion of material onto the neutron star from the be star s envelope . in the be / x - ray systems ,",
    "mass transfer is enhanced during periastron passage , as the neutron star passes through the denser regions of the companion s disc , resulting in x - ray outbursts with luminosities typically 10 - 100 times stronger than the quiescent level @xcite . in some cases outbursts",
    "are seen with no correlation to orbital phase ( gro j1948 - 03 , zhang et al . , 1996 ; v0332 + 53 , terrel & preidhorsky 1984 ) .",
    "these outbursts are usually much more intense and are believed to be the result of large mass loss events from the be star , although the mechanism behind such events is yet unclear .",
    "+    the be / x - ray binary 4u1145 - 619 is a highly variable x - ray source which has been optically identified with the 9th magnitude b1ve star v801cen ( bradt et al .",
    "1977 ; dower et al .",
    "white et al . ( 1978 ) found two x - ray pulsation periods of 292s and 297s from the field of the _ uhuru _ source 4u1145 - 61 , but were unable to confirm whether both periods originated in the one source , or whether there were in fact two x - ray pulsars within the field .",
    "the ambiguity was resolved when observations with the imaging proportional counter on the _ einstein observatory _ ( lamb et al .",
    "1980 ; white et al .",
    "1980 ) revealed the presence of two pulsars separated by 15@xmath2 .",
    "the source identified with v801cen ( redesignated 4u1145 - 619 ) was found to pulsate with the 292s period , whilst the 297s period was found to originate in a new source , designated 1e 1145.1 - 6141 , which was later found to be a member of the class of hmxb s with supergiant companions ( hutchings , crampton & cowley , 1981 ) .",
    "analysis of the long - term x - ray behaviour of 4u1145 - 619 revealed recurrent outbursts with a period of 186.5 days .",
    "outbursts are typically of 10 day duration with flux levels increasing by a factor of @xmath35 ( watson et al .",
    "1981 ; priedhosky & terrell 1983 ; warwick , watson & willingdale 1985 ) . during the majority of the observed outbursts ,",
    "the pulsed fraction of the total flux is relatively low .",
    "this , and the low luminosity of the source led white et al .",
    "( 1983 ) to list 4u1145 - 619 as one of the best approximations to a spherically accreting binary system .",
    "the accepted model for this system is that of a long period eccentric binary .",
    "the 186.5 day period in x - ray behaviour is then the consequence of phase dependant accretion from the be star s circumstellar disc .",
    "in this section we present our own infrared and optical observations made between 1993 march and 1996 april .",
    "these observations were made as part of the southampton / valencia / saao long term monitoring campaign of high mass x - ray binaries ( coe et al .",
    "1993 ; reig et al .",
    "in addition , we present optical photometric data taken from the catalogue of eso s long term photometry of variables ( ltpv ) project ( sterken et al . 1995 and references therein ) covering the period 19821994 , and a summary of previously published x - ray observations .      [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "1.0      the infrared lightcurves in figure  1 show the luminosity of the source to be decreasing in all bands throughout the period of the observations .",
    "short term variations aside , the long term trend is a decrease of @xmath31 mag .",
    "the change in magnitude increases with wavelength , with the change in _",
    "j , h , k _ and _ l _ approximately 0.7 , 0.9 , 0.9 and 1.3 respectively . the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission has been in decay during the same period , the one data point in exception being that of 1994 march 7 , which is just 10 days ( 0.05 phase ) before the maximum of the large x - ray outburst detected by batse .",
    "observations have shown that the balmer emission and the infrared excess characteristic of be stars originate in the same circumstellar disc ( dachs and wamsteker , 1982 ) .",
    "hence a decrease in disc size would result in the observed variations in the infrared magnitudes and the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission . also ,",
    "as the disc s continuum is cooler than that of the photosphere , it is at longer wavelengths that we expect to see the largest variation in magnitude , again in agreement with the data .    in order to investigate the implications of the optical and infrared data presented here in the context of the past behaviour of the star , data were taken from the catalogue of eso s long term photometry of variables project ( sterken et al .",
    "the data ( strmgren @xmath4 photometry , covering the period 1982 to 1994 ) along with derived indices are shown in figure  3 , and were described in section 2.3 . of note is the scale of the long term variability .",
    "the range of _ v _ magnitude is @xmath5_v_@xmath30.6 , whilst @xmath5(_b  y_)@xmath30.2 . as ( _ b  y _ ) increases with optical luminosity , again",
    "the data indicate that the variations are greater at longer wavelengths .",
    "figure  5 shows explicitly the relationship between luminosity and colour , represented by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "it is clear that in the high state , the ( @xmath8 ) index shows the star to be redder than in the low state . as with the infrared photometry then , the size of the variations and their dependance upon wavelength implies that they are the result of changes in the size of the circumstellar disc .",
    "hence , with the new infrared and optical data we now have an indication of the way in which the disc has decayed , recovered and decayed again over the past 13 years from 1982 december to 1996 april .    the complete data set shows three disc loss episodes , corresponding to the two previously observed optical minima , and the current optical decay . although the infrared and spectroscopic data in the period before our own observations is sparse , they are consistent with the timescale of disc loss and recovery suggested by the optical lightcurve .",
    "similar episodes of disc loss have been observed in other be / x - ray binary systems .",
    "most notably , observations of x persei have shown the h@xmath0 line changing from emission to absorption over a period of months ( norton et al .",
    "1991 ) . in the case of 4u1145 - 619 , complete disc loss is clearly not the case at present , despite the decay in strength , because both the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines remain in emission .      in figure",
    "3 the epochs of x - ray outbursts are plotted as arrows above the @xmath6 band lightcurve .",
    "again we define an outburst as an increase in flux by a factor of five above the quiescent flux of @xmath310@xmath9 ergs s@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "six batse detections are plotted , these corresponding to the six penultimate arrows ( scott m. private communication ) .",
    "there appears to be a correlation between the x - ray and optical behaviour , with x - ray activity increased during periods of optical decline .",
    "although we can not however rule out the possibility that the apparent correlation is an artifact of the epochs of the x - ray observations , such a correlation is not unexpected , as the x - ray emission is fueled by the material in the varying disc . if the material lost from the disc is dissipated away from the star , rather than falling back onto the surface , then some fraction of this material should accrete onto the neutron star providing additional fuel for x - ray emission .",
    "this scenario was suggested by roche et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to explain similar correlations in the x - ray and optical / infrared behaviour of the be / x - ray binary x persei .",
    "many be / x - ray binary systems however show correlations of the opposite nature , with increased x - ray activity coinciding with optically bright phases ( 4u0115 + 63 , negueruela et al . 1997 ; a0538 - 66 , corbet et al .",
    "a distinguishing factor between these two groups is the significant difference in orbital period . both 4u1145 - 619 and x persei",
    "are long period binaries , with wide orbits , 4u0115 + 63 and a0538 - 66 each have periods less than 30 days , with much smaller orbits . in the case of the long period binaries ,",
    "the neutron star may not become immersed in the disc during periastron passage , but rather accrete from the material that is lost radially from this disc during phases of decline in the be star s activity .",
    "such a scenario would be consistent with spherical accretion .",
    "in such a binary , where the neutron star does not accrete directly from the be star s disc , but from material lost radially from it , we might expect any orbital modulation of x - ray flux to be of smaller amplitude and smoother in profile than in systems where the neutron star becomes immersed in the disc at periastron .",
    "however in the case of 4u1145 - 619 the orbital modulation in the x - ray lightcurve is significant , with outbursts lasting less than 0.1 phase and increases in flux of an order of magnitude above quiescence .",
    "if this sharp modulation were caused by centrifugal inhibition of accretion ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) , then we should not detect quiescent flux from the source .",
    "corbet ( 1996 ) showed that x - ray emission may originate from the magnetosphere of the neutron star , even when accretion onto the neutron star surface was prohibited .",
    "we note that corbet finds in the case of 4u1145 - 619 , that this emission should be a factor of 7375 less than the minimum emission from the neutron star s surface .",
    "the quiescent flux observed in 4u1145 - 619 is only a factor of @xmath35 less than the normal outburst luminosity , suggesting that accretion onto the neutron star s surface is still occurring throughout the entire orbit .",
    "the sharp modulation may indicate an inclination between the planes of the orbit and the be star s disc , the sharp modulation occuring as the neutron star s orbit crosses the plane of the disc at periastron .      the source s relatively low luminosity , wide orbit , and low pulsed fraction during ` minor ' outbursts points towards spherical accretion as the source of energy for x - ray emission from 4u1145 - 619 ( white et al .",
    "arons & lea ( 1980 ) suggested that the area of the accretion hot spot in accreting neutron stars increases as the x - ray luminosity decreases . for low - luminosity sources ( l@xmath12 @xmath13 5 @xmath14 10@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 ) ,",
    "as is the case with 4u1145 - 619 during minor x - ray outbursts ( see figure  4 ) , assuming the derived distance of 3.1 kpc , the accretion area can be as large as the entire surface of the neutron star .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum of the flow in 4u1145 - 619 would be low and material would build up outside the magnetosphere before penetrating and falling unevenly over most of the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the large outburst of 1994 march however allows an alternative scenario . at the maximum of the major outburst ,",
    "the total flux detected by batse was 0.5-crab ( 2040 kev ) , with a significant phase averaged pulsed flux of 0.3-crab ( wilson et al .",
    "1994 ) , suggesting that in this instance at least , accretion was concentrated to a greater degree onto the magnetic poles .",
    "such a difference in the pulsed fraction of the total flux could be interpreted as evidence for the formation of a short - lived accretion disc , which would allow more efficient binding of material to the magnetic field lines . in support of this hypothesis ,",
    "the spin period of the neutron star was seen to decrease during the 1994 march outburst , whilst no significant spin - up was detected during the five less intense outbursts seen by batse between mjd  48361 and mjd  50231 ( scott m. , private communication ) .",
    "this scenario would require a change in the circumstellar environment to account for the lack of accretion disc formation at other periastron passages .",
    "this requirement would be fulfilled by having a greater density of circumstellar material resulting from the proposed mass ejection event from the be star .",
    "further evidence for the formation of a temporary accretion disc comes from the fact that the march 1994 outburst continued at detectable levels longer than usual after maximum flux .",
    "mereghetti et al .",
    "( 1987 ) however give an alternative suggestion that such x - ray lightcurve profiles could be due to the compression of accreting material in the bow shock of the neutron star , followed by the accretion of more dilute `` downstream '' material .",
    "we also note that shortly before the batse detection in march 1994 , the ew(h@xmath0 ) strengthened to -45 , with no correlated rise in the infrared luminosity .",
    "either a delay exists between the reaction of the disc s balmer emision and infrared excess , or an additional h@xmath0 component was present , with a source discrete from that of the infrared excess .",
    "an accretion disc could produce this h@xmath0 emission with no correlated change in the infrared magnitudes .      comparing the astrophysical parameters calculated in section  3 to previously published values yields few incompatibilities .",
    "the spectral type of b1 ve is in agreement with previous classifications based on spectroscopic results .",
    "previous values for _ e(b  v ) _ have been in the range 0.25@xmath13_e(b  v)_@xmath130.45 , our value of 0.29 sits comfortably in the middle .",
    "the temperature of the star has been determined from a model atmosphere fit to an ultraviolet spectrum by bianchi and bernacca ( 1980 ) .",
    "their result of 22,000 k is not consistent with our value of 25,500@xmath161,500 k ( bianchi and bernacca quote no errors ) , but we must consider the difference of the methods used .",
    "the method used here has removed circumstellar effects using a transform involving the ew(h@xmath0 ) index , whereas the method of bianchi and bernacca , whilst not corrected for circumstellar effects , was applied in the ultraviolet spectral region , where circumstellar effects may be expected to be minimal .",
    "however , kaiser ( 1989 ) notes that fitting model atmospheres to be star spectrophotometric measurements reveals systematic differences between the model and observations , and thus demonstrates the existence of radiation emitted by the envelope at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the continuum emission of the disc is redder than that of the photosphere of the underlying be star , and hence unless circumstellar effects are taken into account , stellar temperatures will be underestimated .",
    "the result which appears most discrepant with previously published values is the distance of 3.1 kpc , a factor of two larger than the generally accepted 1.5 kpc to this source ( hammerschlag - hensberge et al .",
    "1980 ; lamb et al .",
    "again there are significant differences in the methods employed in calculating the distance .",
    "hammerschlag - hensberge et al .",
    "find 1.6 kpc from the dereddening necessary to fit observed ultraviolet fluxes with expected spectra , but state that since colour excess is known to be insensitive to distance at this particular galactic longitude , the distance quoted may be in error by a factor of three or more .",
    "the be / x - ray binary 4u1145 - 619 is exhibiting signs of disc loss in optical and infrared wavelengths , after two previous such events since 1982 . whilst the infrared excess has decreased by @xmath5_k_@xmath171",
    ", the disc does not appear to have been lost completely , as the h@xmath0 line still shows emission , the last observations showing ew(h@xmath0 ) = -13 @xmath16 1.3  .",
    "x - ray luminosities and pulse profiles during normal outbursts are typical of those expected for spherically accreting systems , though there is a possibility of the formation of a short - lived accretion disc during larger outbursts .    physical parameters calculated for the optical counterpart v801 cen show discrepancies with previously published values , but the discrepancies can usually be explained in terms of the circumstellar effects which need to be corrected for in the case of be stars .",
    "contemporaneous infrared and optical observations over the course of the next optical rise , combined with x - ray observations should confirm the existance or otherwise of any optical / x - ray correlations , and lead to a more complete understanding of the mechanisms fuelling this source , and long period be / x - ray binaries in general .",
    "we are grateful to staff at the saao for their assistance , and to tom marsh and chris moran for obtaining the aat spectrum .",
    "thanks also to the referee reinhard hanuschik for his comments on the original manuscript .",
    "much helpful information regarding batse observations was provided by matt scott .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
