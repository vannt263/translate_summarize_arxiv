    "have been obtained depending on details of the analysis , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological analysis often involves decay processes where , besides state mixing , also weak decay constants appear .",
    "the decay constants are defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the @xmath10 octet and @xmath11 the @xmath10 singlet axial - vector current , respectively .",
    "frequently , it is assumed that the decay constants follow the pattern of state mixing : @xmath12 however , recent theoretical @xcite as well as phenomenological @xcite investigations have shown that eq .",
    "( [ oldmix ] ) can not be correct . adopting",
    "the new and general parametrization @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 turned out to differ considerably .",
    "the phenomenological analysis @xcite , which involved the combined analysis of the two - photon decay widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transition form factors and the additional constraint from the radiative @xmath18 decays , allowed to determine the four quantities occuring in eq .",
    "( [ newmix ] ) .",
    "most importantly , the values obtained satisfy the constraints @xcite from chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the appearance of the four parameters @xmath19 raises anew the problem of their mutual relations and their connection with the mixing angle of the particle states .",
    "this angle is necessarily a single one since mixing with higher states ",
    "the @xmath20 for instance  can be neglected at this stage .",
    "the relation of this angle with the four parameters in eq .",
    "( [ newmix ] ) does not need to be simple : in a parton language @xcite the decay constants are controlled by specific fock state wave functions at zero spatial separation of the quarks while state mixing refers to the mixing in the overall wave functions .",
    "in this work we express @xmath0 and @xmath1 as linear combinations of orthogonal states @xmath21 and @xmath22 which can be generated by the axial vector currents with the flavor structure @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "they are chosen in such a way that both states have vanishing vacuum - particle matrix elements with the opposite currents , i.e.their lowest fock space components have the compositions @xmath25 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "our motivation for choosing this specific basis comes from the fact that the breaking of @xmath10 by the quark masses influences the two parts differently , and from the observation that vector and tensor mesons  where the axial vector anomaly plays no role  have state mixing angles very close to the ideal mixing angle @xmath26 .",
    "we will demonstrate that the proper use of this quark flavor basis provides for new insights and successful predictions .",
    "we point out that we employ fixed ( momentum - independent ) basis states .",
    "thus , our state mixing angle is momentum independent and well - defined also in any other basis obtained by an orthogonal transformation .",
    "this differs from other possible approaches in which momentum dependent mass matrices are introduced ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the decay constants , on the other hand , will in general depend on @xmath27 , i.e.  the particle states and masses , and will thus require a parametrization by two different mixing angles as in ( [ newmix ] ) .",
    "these angles depend on the basis which is used for the definition of the decay constants .",
    "as described below , the basic assumption which we will use in this paper is that the decay constants follow the state mixing if and only if they are defined with respect to the quark basis . in this circumstance",
    "the two angles for the decay constants obtained in this basis and the corresponding state mixing angle coincide and are thus momentum - independent .",

    "it is equivalent to the requirement that the contribution @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) to the decay constants obtained from the @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) components of the wave functions is independent of the meson involved .",
    "this assumption appears plausible but we have no rigorous justification for it and have to test it .",
    "it is certainly restrictive as will be shown in sect .",
    "[ theorysect ] : first , it reduces the number of parameters again to three . secondly , by invoking the divergences of the currents , the angle @xmath29 is connected to @xmath33 .",
    "finally , flavor symmetry fixes @xmath31 and @xmath32 to first order of @xmath10 breaking , leaving us  to this order  with no free parameter .",

    "numerous phenomenological checks are possible and performed in sect .  [ phensect ] .",
    "we determine phenomenological values for the three parameters from the data and check for consistency with chpt and the earlier determination @xcite of the four quantities @xmath19 .",

[ etacsect ] .",
