    "scalar leptons are among the lightest supersymmetric particles in many susy - breaking scenarios @xcite .",
    "presently , the experimental ( lower ) limits on electron , muon , and tau slepton masses are 73 gev , 94 gev , and 81.9 gev , respectively @xcite .",
    "since sleptons often decay into the corresponding sm partner and the lightest stable susy particle , the distinctive signature at hadron colliders will consist in a highly energetic lepton pair and associated missing energy .    the leading order ( lo ) cross section for the production of non - mixing slepton pairs has been calculated in @xcite , while the mixing between the interaction eigenstates was included in @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections have been calculated in @xcite , and the full susy - qcd corrections with non - mixing squarks in the loops have been added in @xcite . recently ,",
    "an accurate calculation of the transverse - momentum ( @xmath2 ) spectrum including soft - gluon resummation at the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy has been performed @xcite , allowing for the reconstruction of the mass and the determination of the spin of the produced particles by means of the cambridge ( s)transverse mass variable @xcite and for distinguishing thus the susy signal from the sm background , mainly due to @xmath3 and @xmath4 production @xcite .",
    "very recently , the mixing effects relevant for the squarks appearing in the loops have been investigated at nlo , and the threshold - enhanced contributions have been computed at nll @xcite .",
    "the numerical results show a stabilization of the perturbative results through a considerable reduction of the scale dependence and a modest increase with respect to the nlo cross section",
    ".    since the dynamical origin of the enhanced contributions is the same both in transverse - momentum and threshold resummations , i.e.the soft - gluon emission by the initial state , it would be desirable to have a formalism capable to handle at the same time the soft - gluon contributions in both the delicate kinematical regions , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the slepton pair invariant - mass and @xmath8 the partonic centre - of - mass energy .",

    "resummation formalism has been developed in the last eight years @xcite .",
    "the exponentiation of the singular terms in the mellin ( @xmath9 ) and impact - parameter ( @xmath10 ) space has been proven , and a consistent method to perform the inverse transforms , avoiding the landau pole and the singularities of the parton distribution functions , has been introduced .",
    "applications to prompt - photon @xcite , electroweak boson @xcite , higgs boson @xcite , and heavy - quark pair @xcite production at hadron colliders have exhibited substantial effects of joint resummation on the differential cross sections .    in this paper",

    "we can see the @xmath143-wave behaviour relative to the pair production of scalar particles , since the invariant - mass distribution rises above the threshold at @xmath144 with the third power of the slepton velocity and peaks at about 200 gev above threshold ( both for @xmath139 and the not shown @xmath141 differential distribution ) , before falling off steeply due to the @xmath8-channel propagator and the decreasing parton luminosity . in the large-@xmath7 region ,",
    "the resummed cross section is 30% higher than the leading order cross section , but this represents only a 3% increase with respect to the nlo susy - qcd result . in the small-@xmath7 region , much further then from the hadronic threshold , resummation effects are rather limited , inducing a modification of the nlo results smaller than 1% .",
    "the shaded , horizontally , and vertically hashed bands in fig.[fig:3 ] represent the theoretical uncertainties for the lo , nlo susy - qcd , and the jointly - matched predictions . at lo the dependence comes only from the factorization scale and increases with the momentum - fraction @xmath145 of the partons in the proton ( i.e.with @xmath7 ) , being thus larger in the right part of the figure .",
    "this dependence is largely reduced at nlo due to the factorization of initial - state singularities in the pdfs . including the dependence due to the renormalization scale in the coupling @xmath146 , the total variation is about 7%-11% .",
    "after resummation , the total scale uncertainty is finally reduced to only 7%-8% for the matched result , the reduction being of course more important in the large-@xmath7 region , where the resummation effects are more important .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we show the cross section correction factors [ eq : kbis ] k^i = as a function of the invariant - mass @xmath7 . @xmath147",
    "labels the corrections induced by nlo qcd , nlo susy - qcd , joint- and threshold - resummation ( as obtained in @xcite ) , these two last calculations being matched with the nlo susy - qcd result . at small invariant mass @xmath7 , the resummation is less important , since we are quite far from the hadronic threshold , as shown in the left part of the plot . at larger @xmath7 ,",
    "the logarithms become important and lead to a larger increase of the resummed @xmath137-factors over the fixed - order one .",
    "we also show the difference between threshold and joint resummations , which is only about one or two percents .",
    "this small difference is due to the choice of the sudakov form factor @xmath148 and of the @xmath149-function , which correctly reproduce transverse - momentum resummation in the limit of @xmath73 , @xmath9 being fixed , but which present some differences in the pure threshold limit @xmath150 and @xmath74 , as it was the case for joint resummation for higgs and electroweak boson production @xcite .",
    "however , this effect is under good control , since it is much smaller than the theoretical scale uncertainty of about 7% .",
    "with this work we complete our programme of performing precision calculations for slepton pair production at hadron colliders . together with the previous papers on transverse - momentum @xcite and threshold @xcite resummation , soft - gluon resummation effects",
    "are now consistently included in predictions for various distributions exploiting the @xmath11 , threshold , and joint resummation formalisms .",
    "we found that the effects obtained from resumming the enhanced soft contributions are important at hadron colliders , even far from the critical kinematical regions where the resummation procedure is fully justified .",
    "the numerical results show a considerable reduction of the scale uncertainty with respect to fixed order results and also a negligible dependence on non - perturbative effects , introduced through different gaussian - like smearings of the sudakov form factors .",
    "these features lead to an increased stability of the perturbative results and thus to a possible improvement of the slepton pair ( slepton - sneutrino ) search strategies at the lhc .",
