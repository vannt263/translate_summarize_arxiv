    "the obvious next question is how these spinless fermions interact .",
    "a typical way to characterize the distribution of steps is by their terrace - width distribution ( twd ) , i.e. the probability of finding the next step a distance @xmath7 away .",
    "this probability distribution is denoted @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the step spacing normalized by the [ only ] characteristic length in the @xmath11 direction . by construction",

    "( it ultimately corresponds to @xmath18 of random - matrix theory . )",

    "if the steps are imagined as straight (  uncooked spaghetti \" ) and deposited randomly with probability 1/@xmath20 , then @xmath16 becomes exp(-@xmath19 ) .",
    "in fact , however , at finite temperature the steps do meander , leading to well - known entropic ( or steric ) repulsion due to the underweighting in the partition function of steps on the verge of crossing .",
    "this effect is particularly noticeable as @xmath19 approaches 0 : @xmath16 now vanishes with power - law behavior rather than growing to unity . for @xmath21 @xmath16 must decay faster than exp(-@xmath19 ) to preserve the unit mean ;",
    "analogies with random walkers suggest exp(-@xmath22 ) as the form of the tail @xcite .",
    "there are many arguments to show that the entropic repulsion per length is proportional to @xmath23 ; here the step stiffness @xmath24 , with [ orientation - dependent ] free energy per length conventionally called @xmath25 in surface studies .",
    "in addition to the entropic repulsion , there generally is an elastic interaction , also having the inverse - square form @xmath26 , due to repulsion between force dipoles intrinsic to the steps @xcite : viewed from a continuum picture , the step involves a pair of sharp angles which could lower their energy by healing to form more obtuse angles .",
    "this process leads to a strain field around the step in which atoms in the terraces bounding the step ( both above and below ) tend to move away from the step .",
    "atoms between two steps are then frustrated since they are pushed in opposite directions by the pair of steps .",
    "thus , they can not relax fully , leading effectively to a repulsion , with @xmath27 proportional to the product of the step dipoles .",
    "in the fermion picture , the strength of the elastic repulsion only enters in the dimensionless combination    @xmath28    the elastic and entropic repulsions do not simply add together : as the strength @xmath27 of the elastic interaction increases , the chance of steps coming near each other decreases , thereby reducing the entropic repulsion .",

    "it is generally believed that the repulsions can be adequately approximated as acting between pairs of steps at the same value of @xmath15 , i.e. instantaneously in the 1d fermion representation .",

    "these parametric results were dramatically verified for si(111 ) : not only was the twd measured at one misorientation well fit by a gaussian , but the twd at a second misorientation was well described by another gaussian whose width was simply rescaled by the change in @xmath0 , with @xmath41 refitting @xcite .    however , the grenoble group pointed out a flaw in gruber - mullins approach in the limit of very strong @xmath38 @xcite . there",
    "the entropic repulsion becomes negligible and the steps can be imagined as meandering independently ( albeit by a small amount ) .",

    "( the actual increase is less than two - fold due to lingering anticorrelations . ) hence , a fit of the twd width in the gruber - mullins approximation would underestimate @xmath38 by a factor of over 3 in the limit of very large @xmath38 . based on roughening theory",
    ", the saclay group @xcite concluded that the underestimate , for more general @xmath38 , was somewhat smaller ( about 2 ) .",
