    "a bare hpge crystal ( 5.1  cm diameter , 3.5  cm height , 0.39  kg ) is submerged in a dewar ( 29  cm diameter , 90  cm height ) filled with lar .",
    "a wavelength shifting and reflecting foil defines the active volume of 19  kg lar .",
    "the shifted scintillation photons are detected with one 8  etl 9357 pmt immersed in lar .",
    "the dewar system is enclosed in a gas tight stainless steel tank to prevent quenching from oxygen or water traces .",
    "low activity calibration sources can be inserted up to 8  mm from the hpge crystal via a hermetically closed stainless steel tube .",
    "the daq is triggered by the hpge diode .",
    "the hpge and pmt  signals are then recorded event - by - event and stored for the off - line analysis on disk .",
    "hpge signals are discarded in the analysis if a simultaneous scintillation signal has been recorded .",
    "an analysis threshold at the single photo electron level was applied . a photo electron ( pe )",
    "yield of about 410 pe / mev was observed during these measurements .",
    "the measurement were performed from october to december 2005 using various gamma sources ( @xmath5cs , @xmath6co , @xmath7th , @xmath8ra ) , alternated with periods of background measurements .",
    "given the limited space available in this proceedings , we present only the results achieved with the @xmath7th  gamma source .",
    "the source consists of a natural thorium metal wire thus containing @xmath9th and its progeny @xmath10tl . the measured energy spectrum is displayed in fig .  [ fig : prop ] .",
    "the line histograms correspond to spectra without background subtraction and the filled histograms after background subtraction .",

    "the background spectra have been measured separately and subtracted prior to forming the ratio .",
    "for single gamma decays as for example for the 662  kev @xmath5cs  line , the full energy ( fe ) peak is not suppressed after applying the lar anti - coincidence cut , since no energy deposition occurs in the lar .",
    "the measured value for @xmath5cs  is @xmath13 .",
    "an important background source for 0@xmath1  is the photons emitted in the decay of @xmath10tl , a progeny of @xmath7th . as the @xmath10tl2615  kev gamma is part of a gamma cascade in the deexcitation of @xmath10tl , the fe peak is suppressed in case that a second gamma deposits energy inside the lar .",
    "@xmath14 for the 2615  kev line is @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath10tl  compton events which deposit an energy close to @xmath16  kev inside the crystal are vetoed with @xmath17 , or in other words , the compton continuum is suppressed by a factor 17 .",
    "the experimental data are compared with monte - carlo simulations using the mage  geant4 framework @xcite developed jointly by the majorana  and gerda  collaborations . the spectral shape and peak - to - compton ratio measured with @xmath5cs , @xmath7th  and",

    "note that the @xmath7th  source is not in secular equilibrium , thus the poor agreement at low energies .",
    "the survival probability after applying the lar veto cut at 2039  kev obtained with mage  mc simulation corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "a possible origin of the higher mc value may be related to the simplified geometrical description of the crystal holder which had small lar dead volumes not included in the simulation .",
    "the experimental data show that the detection of lar scintillation photons is a powerful method to suppress backgrounds with negligible loss of 0@xmath1  signals . in the setup with an active lar mass of 19  kg",
    "we observed a background suppression of the @xmath10tlcompton continuum at 2039  kev by a factor of 17 .",
    "the suppression factor is limited by gammas escaping from the small lar volume .",
    "mage  mc simulations reproduce the energy spectra as well as the suppression factors .",
    "an ultra - low background prototype setup is presently under construction at lngs ( gerda - large ) .",
    "the purpose of the device is to study the novel suppression method at ultra - low backgrounds with an active lar mass of approximately 1  ton .",
    "the instrument will be used to study the background of gerda  phase  i detector assemblies prior to their operation in gerda .",
