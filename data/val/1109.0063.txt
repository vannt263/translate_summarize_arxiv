    "fig : phases ] ( a ) ] , is one of the models deeply related to spin chirality ; we can define clockwise / anticlockwise rotation along the rung in the spin tube .",
    "in fact , the topological structure of the spin tube is known to induce several interesting phenomena  @xcite .",
    "recently , spin - tube materials such as [ ( cucl@xmath5tachh)@xmath6cl]cl@xmath5  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite have been really synthesized and characteristic properties to the spin tube have been revealed by several experimental approaches . in particular , it is pointed out that the broad peak of specific heat is associated with a gapful chirality excitation in the _ twisted _ tube [ ( cucl@xmath5tachh)@xmath6cl]cl@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be also noted that the contribution from gapless magnetic excitation overlaps this broad peak related to chirality .    in this paper , we demonstrate that the quantum phase transitions associated with the chirality actually occur in the magnetization plateau of the _ straight _ quantum spin tube , where energy scale of the chirality is certainly separated from gapful magnetic excitations .",

    "this model ( [ tube ] ) looks very simple , but the frustration due to the tube structure is expected to induce various characteristic properties .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the model  ( [ tube ] ) has a uniform vector spin chirality order in the weak rung - coupling region ( @xmath13 ) in a magnetic field @xmath14  @xcite .",

    "a key point is that the two - fold degeneracy of @xmath19 sectors in this plateau state brings an active low - energy variable , which is just the chirality degree of freedom . utilizing the low - energy effective model and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    ", we will show that the energetic separation of the spin and chirality excitations leads to nontrivial quantum phase transitions without destroying the magnetization plateau .",
    "the main results are summarized in fig .",

    "[ sec2 ] , we reveal three new phases in the plateau region ; chirality liquid , spin - imbalance , and the ferro - chirality ordered phases .",
    "finally we summarize our result and the relation between it and previous studies in sec .",

    "let us start with the low - energy effective theory for the plateau state in the strong rung - coupling region .",

    "the spin tube has @xmath1-group ( @xmath43 point group ) symmetry in the rung direction in addition to the translational symmetry along the leg direction .",
    "the operations in the @xmath1 group are composed of the cyclic permutation @xmath44 with mod 3 and the reflection @xmath45 at a bond in every unit triangle ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "possible @xmath1-symmetry breakings are classified by its subgroups : ( a ) the bond - parity breaking with conserving the cyclic symmetry , ( b ) the cyclic @xmath47 symmetry breaking with conserving a part of bond - party symmetry , or ( c ) the full breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the vector spin chirality @xmath48 is a typical order parameter in the case ( a ) , which changes its sign by the reflection , but is invariant under the cyclic permutation .",
    "this cyclic symmetry is related to the spin current circulating in the rung direction . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath49 can be an order parameter of the case ( b ) , since its form changes via the cyclic permutation , but is invariant under the reflection @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath49 becomes finite , it suggests that the isosceles - triangle - type imbalance occurs for @xmath51 in the plateau state .",
    "we discuss the relation between the @xmath1 symmetry and the effective model ( [ effective ] ) .",
    "write the cyclic permutation operation of the @xmath1 symmetry group as @xmath52 , and the bond reflection as @xmath53 . in the level of the effective chirality @xmath54 ,",
    "the @xmath1 symmetric operation is given by @xmath55 for any @xmath12 .",
    "under these operations of the @xmath1 symmetry , the effective hamiltonian ( [ effective ] ) is confirmed to be invariant .",
    "here we should remark that in the model  ( [ effective ] ) , the second - roder perturbation process generates the u(1)-symmetry breaking @xmath56 term , although the u(1)-symmetric xy model , which is obtained within the first - order perturbation , has been often used for the spin tubes  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath57 is not exactly conserved in the original spin tube .",

    "is described by a massless free boson theory with several interactions .",

    "the most relevant terms are given by for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for which the scaling dimensions are respectively @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since the value of @xmath62 approaches unity in the @xmath75 limit ( the xy model ) , we can see that the interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) are all irrelevant for sufficiently small @xmath35 , suggesting that the critical chirality liquid is realized in a certain region of small @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand , the system may have two kind of instabilities as @xmath35 increases .",
    "the first case is the ferro - chirality order of @xmath57 . since the negative @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) raises the value of @xmath62 to @xmath77 , the ferromagnetic instability may occur , at which the velocity @xmath63 also vanishes .",
    "the other case is the _ staggered _ order of the imbalanced magnetization @xmath49 ; if @xmath78 , @xmath79-field is locked and then the staggered component of @xmath80 can have a finite expectation value through the relation @xmath81 . here , we note that , in the following numerical computations , the ferro - chirality oder actually appears , but a uniform order of @xmath49 is realized rather than the staggered type .",

    "[ fig:2 ] comes from the open boundary effect .",
    "thus it can be confirmed that the correlation function follows a power - law decay for @xmath87 : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the uniform magnetization per spin and @xmath90 is the critical exponent .",
    "this decay fashion is in agreement with the prediction from the effective tl - liquid theory  ( [ tll ] ) .",
    "we can also see that @xmath90 becomes close to 0.5 in the @xmath91 limit , where the hamiltonian ( [ effective ] ) reduces to the xy model . as @xmath35 increases , @xmath90 approaches zero toward the ferro - chirality transition .",
    "utilizing the effective field theory ( [ tll ] ) based on the xxz chain ( [ effective ] ) , we can evaluate the critical exponent @xmath90 in the strong rung - coupling region @xmath15 .",

    "[ fig:5 ] indicates that the system is gapful .",
    "we note that the imbalanced nature is present not only in the magnetization profile , but also in the spin correlation functions . as we see from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , the correlation length for the less polarized spins becomes divergent as @xmath122 , while that for the most polarized spin remains finite value .",
    "this suggests that the instability of the spin imbalance toward the chirality liquid state ( @xmath123 ) may be governed by the fluctuation of the less polarized spins of the triangle , although the critical behavior of @xmath104 can not be determined within the accuracy of the present dmrg results . as @xmath35 increases ,",
    "the correlation lengths of the most polarized spin and the remaining two become comparable with each other and finally arrives at the ferro - chirality transition point @xmath124 .",

    "this suggests that the hybridization of @xmath126 sector plays an essential role in the imbalanced phase ( see the following paragraphs ) . on the other hand ,",

    "let us discuss the nature of the spin - imbalance phase in more detail . as we disucssed above , the imbalanced order is uniform along the leg direction , while the field theory based on the effective model  ( [ effective ] ) suggests the emergence of a staggered imbalance order ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this mismatch of the effective theory may be attributed to the fact that the imbalanced order is located at very vicinity of the ferro - chirality transition point @xmath127 , where the velocity @xmath63 almost vanishes and thus the system becomes fragile .",
    "furthermore , we find that the rapid increase of @xmath104 in @xmath132 causes a rapid raise of the energy of the unit triangle ( dmrg data are not presented here ) , implying that the effect of @xmath35 nonperturbatively reduces the energy of the intra - triangle bonds . thus it is suggested that the role of the intra - triancle coupling becomes essential and thus the @xmath27 sector certainly hybridizes into the plateau state in the spin - imbalance phase .     on the unit triangle .",
    "]    the effective model ( [ effective ] ) is based on the massive weight of the @xmath19 sector , while the mixing of the @xmath27 sector is possibly essential for the spin imbalance phase .",
    "we should thus investigate the expectation value of @xmath133 , which is the projection operator into the @xmath19 sector . in the @xmath91 limit , @xmath134 and it gradually decreases up to @xmath129 .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows @xmath135 around the transition points , which is obtained by the infinite dmrg . in the figure",
    ", we can see that the behavior of @xmath135 drastically changes at @xmath136 and @xmath137 . in @xmath138 , @xmath139 rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "this supports that the driving mechanism of the spin - imbalance phase relies on the mixing of the @xmath27 sector .",
    "although a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type transition accompanying the @xmath47 symmetry breaking  @xcite is naively expected at @xmath140 , the nature of the phase transition might be essentially modified by the @xmath27 sector .",
    "however , we may claim within the present analysis that@xmath139 is continuously changed around @xmath140 , suggesting a continuous quantum phase transition .",
    "further analysis is necessary to completely determine the nature of this transition , including the universality class . on the other hand",
    ", there exists a clear jump of @xmath139 at @xmath137 .",
    "the two branches near @xmath141 represent two self - consistent solutions corresponding to the chirality ordered and spin - imbalance states in the dmrg iterations ; the solution of the previous parameter is used as an initial state for the next parameter , so that the metastable states can be reproduced . by comparing energies of the two branches ,",
    "the first - order transition point can be determined as @xmath142 .",

    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have explored the quantum phase transitions of the @xmath20 plateau state of the spin tube .",
    "in contrast to the usual plateaus of one - dimensional spin systems ( chains and ladders ) , the chirality degree of freedom generated from the tube structure plays crucial roles . the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( b ) , where the chirality liquid phase with gapless non - magnetic excitations , the spin - imbalance phase and the ferro - chirality phase emerge .",
    "the qualitative features of these phases may be explained by the effective chirality model  ( [ effective ] ) and the @xmath1-symmetry breakings .",
    "however , the precise analysis of the projection operator @xmath143 has revealed that the uniform spin imbalance order is driven by mixing of the @xmath27 sector , which is beyond the scope of the effective model  ( [ effective ] ) .",
    "the transition between the chirality liquid and the spin - imbalance phase is of continuous type , and the fluctuation of less polarized spins in the imbalance phase becomes divergent near the transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition between the spin - imbalance and ferro - chirality ordered phases is shown to be of first order type .    here",
    "it should be commented that another spin - imbalance phase with gapless magnetic excitations is expected in a high magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "its connection to the present spin - imbalance phase may be an interesting problem for through understanding of mechanisms of the spin imbalance .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , a chirality - ordered spin liquid appears in the weak rung - coupling region @xmath13 in magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "this spin liquid is expected to change into the 1/3 plateau state with the chirality order  @xcite via a bkt transition  @xcite at the order of @xmath144 . combining our present results with this",
    ", we can conclude that , as @xmath35 increases from the strong rung limit , the chirality liquid , spin - imbalance order , ferro - chirality order , and ferro - chirality - ordered spin liquid can be observed at @xmath89 in order .",
    "an important aspect of the spin tube is that the phase transitions occur without destroying the plateau .",
    "the energy scale of the chirality is significantly lower than the width of the large plateau .",
    "therefore , for example , a specific heat measurement will solely observe a linear temperature dependence originating from the chirality modes in the wide spin - gapped plateau region of @xmath123 , in contrast to the twisted tube  @xcite . from experimental viewpoint , moreover , another plausible feature of the spin tube is that the gapped chirality order is expanded in the wide range of @xmath35 , which is contrasted to the narrow chirality - ordered phases with gapped magnetic excitations in the classical xy model on triangular lattice  @xcite and spin-@xmath145 @xmath2-@xmath3 chains  @xcite . if a coupling between chirality and electric polarization is introduced , the chirality order can induce a ferro - electric polarization in spite of the absence of any magnetic ordering .",
    "also , the similar chirality degree of freedom is discussed in the coupled trimer model , which may reduce to the spin tube in an anisotropic limit@xcite .",
    "we thus believe that the spin tube provides a fascinating play ground of the chirality degrees in the realistic experimental situation .    this work has been partly supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research ( no.@xmath14623340109 , 23540442 , 21740295 , 23540388 ) and priority area `` novel states of matter induced by frustration '' ( no.22014012 , 22014016 ) from mext , japan .",
