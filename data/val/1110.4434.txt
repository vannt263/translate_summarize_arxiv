    "warped extra dimensional models have been introduced to explain the origin of the discrepancy between planck scale and the electroweak scale @xcite . in the original scenario ,",
    "two branes are introduced , one with an energy scale set at the planck scale , the other at the tev scale , and with the standard model ( sm ) fields localized on the tev brane and gravity allowed to propagate in the bulk . however , in this scenario , higher dimensional operators of the ir fields in the 4-dimensional effective theory are only suppressed by tev scales , leading to large flavor violation and rapid proton decay .    allowing sm fermions and gauge fields to propagate in the bulk effectively suppresses such operators and can also be used to explain the fermion mass hierarchy by fermion localization @xcite .",
    "the drawback is that , in minimal models , excitations of the bulk fields are subjected to tight bounds from precision electroweak tests @xcite and from flavor physics @xcite , and constrained to be heavier than a few tev , making it very hard to produce and observe heavy resonances of these masses at the lhc .",
    "one hope to observe new states from these scenarios might be the radion graviscalar and its associated phenomenology .",
    "the radion is a scalar field associated with fluctuations in the size of the extra dimension , and is a novel feature of warped extra dimensional models @xcite .",
    "the mass of the radion depends on the mechanism that stabilizes the size of the extra dimension . in a simple model with a bulk scalar which generates a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ,",
    "the radion field emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson associated with breaking of translation symmetry @xcite .",
    "generically , the radion may be the lightest new state in an rs - type setup , with its mass suppressed with respect to kk fields by a volume factor of @xmath0 , at least in the small backreaction limit @xcite .",
    "this might put its mass between a few tens to hundreds of gev , with couplings allowing it to have escaped detection at lep , and consistent with precision ew data chl . in general , the radion couplings are similar to higgs couplings in that they are proportional to the mass of the particles it couples with .",
    "moreover the radion field can mix with the higgs boson after ewsb , which involves another parameter , the coefficient of the curvature - scalar term @xcite .",
    "radion phenomenology with and without higgs - radion mixing has been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that a tree - level misalignment between the flavor structure of the yukawa couplings of the radion and the fermion mass matrix will appear when the fermion bulk parameters are not all degenerate @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for these flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) is different than the one producing higgs mediated fcnc s in these same models @xcite .",
    "new data seems to indicate some inconsistencies with the sm predictions as pertaining to the the third generation @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix deviates from the standard , three - generation form @xcite .",
    "a simple extension of the sm to four generations , sm4 , ( adding a new family of quarks and leptons , mirroring the existing ones ) alleviates the problem , and may offer resolutions to some other outstanding problems in the sm @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that , if the fourth generation is incorporated into warped space models , the flavor - changing couplings of the higgs boson can be enhanced , and both the production and decays of the higgs bosons and the decay pattern of the heavy quarks and leptons is altered significantly with respect to the patterns expected in sm4 , thus giving rise to distinguishing signals at the colliders @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that in a warped scenario with extra generations ( seen as a natural extension of the warped space model ) , the flavor - changing couplings of the radion will also yield characteristic signals at colliders .",
    "there are several reasons to perform a separate study for the radion flavor - changing interactions .",
    "a priori , we expect the radion phenomenology to be very different from the higgs boson in four generations . as will be explained later in the text , the production cross section for the higgs bosons in 4 generations is enhanced by a factor of about 10 , while the production cross section for the radion will remain essentially unchanged by the presence of an extra family .",
    "also , contrary to the higgs phenomenology in these models @xcite , exotic flavor violating decays of heavy quarks into radions @xmath1 should be highly suppressed with the new flavor violating couplings of the radion .",
    "these will become important in radion decays into quarks @xmath2 as well as into leptons @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "very recent data from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc indicate that a higgs boson in a scenario with four generations must be very heavy .",
    "these measurements do not affect the radion mass directly , but will set limits on the combined radion mass  interaction scale parameter space . while we stated that the phenomenology with three and four generations is quite similar , there are ( new ) fcnc effects of fourth generation quarks and leptons interacting with the radion",

    "this is because a higgs with 4 generations will mainly be produced in gluon fusion ( with almost no other production channel ) and so there will be no need of subtracting events coming from other production mechanisms .",
    "another important issue when translating higgs bounds is that the width of a heavier higgs ( @xmath195gev ) starts to be relevant ( i.e. becomes larger than the experimental resolution ) .",
    "this means that more background events must be integrated in order to optimize signal events .",
    "but the radion width is always going to remain much smaller than experimental resolution due to its couplings being suppressed by @xmath194 ( and not @xmath193 as in the higgs case ) .",
    "we must therefore adjust again the higgs limits in order to take this fact into account , since much less background events should be kept in a pure radion search @xcite .",
    "with all this in mind , we translate tevatron and lhc bounds from higgs searches and show the excluded regions in figure [ bounds ] . from the tevatron collider",
    ", we use the cdf and d0 combined search for a fourth generation higgs , which allows interesting bounds up to masses of @xmath196 gev @xcite .",
    "this search focuses on the higgs decay into pairs of @xmath197 bosons and makes use of an integrated luminosity of @xmath198 fb@xmath199 . as for the lhc",
    ", we use the recent results from the atlas experiment @xcite , in which they perform a combination of different channels , with integrated luminosities up to @xmath200 fb@xmath199 . as one",
    "can see , lhc data from a single experiment outperforms the tevatron and quite interesting bounds can be set up to a mass of @xmath201 gev .",
    "we note that because the relative importance of different channels is not exactly the same for higgs and radion ( specially the branching of the @xmath202 channel differs from @xmath203 ) , in the lower mass region @xmath204 gev we avoid the combination and use exclusively the atlas limits from @xmath203 search . above that point",
    "the branchings of higgs and radion into heavy vector bosons are essentially the same , specially if we assume for the plot that the fourth generation of fermions ( if it exists ) is heavy enough , with masses greater than @xmath205 gev .",
    "finally we note from this figure that radion phenomenology does not really change due to the addition of a fourth family .",
    "this might seem surprising because the higgs phenomenology is greatly affected by the presence of a fourth family of fermions ( specially fourth family quarks ) due to an important enhancement in the higgs production cross section .",
    "this does not happen in the case of the radion , because its couplings with massless gauge bosons are quite indifferent to the addition of new heavy degrees of freedom . even though the new added fields will produce new loop contributions to @xmath206 or to @xmath207 , their presence",
    "will also alter the @xmath208 functions of the appropriate gauge groups , which will affect the couplings of the radion to massless bosons through the trace anomaly .",
    "the new trace anomaly effects coming from a fourth family will in fact cancel the previous loop contributions in the limit of very heavy new states @xcite , and so basically the radion couplings to photons and gluons remains the same , controlled only by the light degrees of freedom of the theory @xcite .",
    "radion couplings to fermions , massive and massless gauge bosons have all been investigated before @xcite . here",
    "we investigate the changes in branching ratios due to the effect of a fourth generation , and of flavor - changing interactions .",
    "we assume no higgs - radion mixing .",
    "we present our results in fig .",
    "[ radiondecays ] .",
    "note that we keep the radion mass to be above @xmath209 gev to avoid constraints from b - meson decays and astrophysical data @xcite .     and @xmath210 .",
    "the masses chosen for this plot are @xmath211 gev , @xmath212 gev , @xmath213 gev and @xmath214 gev , and the kk scale is @xmath215 gev @xmath216 gev ) . , width=566,height=377 ]    depending on the masses of the fourth generation leptons and neutrinos , fcnc decay channels ( @xmath217 ) could open for @xmath218gev . at higher radion masses ,",
    "the @xmath219 and @xmath220 dominate . in this region",
    ", the radion could be observed through the semi - leptonic channel @xmath221 , and similarly @xmath222 ( avoiding the fully hadronic channel which suffers from large qcd dijet background ) , but the decays rate would be comparable to that of a direct higgs boson production .    finally , for light ( dirac ) fourth - generation neutrinos or leptons , near the present bounds , radion branching ratios to @xmath223 and @xmath224 can be significant and compete with @xmath225 and @xmath226 decays , and thus significantly alter radion decay patterns for @xmath227 gev .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the phenomenology of the couplings , especially the flavor - violating ones , of the radion to fermions in a warped model with three and four generations where the fermions are allowed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "we have shown how to obtain these couplings analytically , and presented leading order expressions for them in a compact form . although the radion fcnc couplings have been analyzed before , some of the analytic expressions presented here are new .",
    "we also explored the regions in which the couplings lie , and maximal values for these , as contour plots in a plane defined by coefficients describing quark localization with respect to the tev brane .",
    "we are able to predict typical ( and maximal ) values for the radion coupling to heavy - heavy , light - light , and heavy - light quarks , and these results are confirmed by an extensive numerical scan .    applying these to phenomenology of the radion , we calculated the tree - level fcnc contributions to @xmath228 , @xmath176 , @xmath182 and @xmath181 mixing , and the restrictions imposed on the couplings .",
    "we obtain simple expressions relating quark localization to these experimental values .",
    "the most stringent constraints are from @xmath176 , yielding a region of space in @xmath185 parameter space disfavored by flavor violation consideration .",
    "we add to these the most recent constraints on higgs masses , from atlas and cms , translating them into combined radion mass - scale limits .",
    "our figure shows that a large range around a light radion mass - low scale ( @xmath229 tev , @xmath230 gev ) survives .",
    "our analysis also shows that , unlike the case of the higgs boson , there are minute differences between radion mass - scale limits in 3 and 4 generations , and thus these limits are quite independent of the number of generations .",
    "this conclusion stands in the case where the radion decays are not significantly influenced by decays into fourth generation fermions ( in particular to fourth generation neutrinos or leptons , which have the lowest mass bounds ) . in a complete decay plot , we include all branching ratios of the radion .",
    "expected to be light , the radion decays primarily to @xmath231 and @xmath232 at low masses ( @xmath233 gev ) , while for heavier radions ( @xmath234 gev ) , fcnc decay channel such as @xmath235 ( assuming dirac neutrinos ) and @xmath236 open , with branching ratios of @xmath237 .",
    "these are the most promising fcnc decays of the radion , barring the unlikely appearance of @xmath238 at the high @xmath212 gev threshold .",
    "however , flavor - conserving radion decays into fourth generation leptons and neutrinos can be large ( for @xmath239 gev ) and alter the dominant decay modes for a heavier radion @xmath240 .",
    "these are typical decay for a radion in a model with four generations and would provide a distinguishing signal for the model .",
    "if a heavy higgs - like state is discovered at the lhc with the usual `` golden mode '' , @xmath241 , a width measurement could rule out a conventional higgs boson",
    ". a careful study for different and/or exotic decay channels of that resonance might be the key to discover both a fourth generation of fermions and a warped extra dimension .",

    "we can use the previous analytical expressions for these couplings to obtain surprisingly simple parametric dependences in terms of the 5d mass parameters , up to leading order in ratios of the fermion masses @xmath246 and of wave function profiles @xmath47 .",
