    "moderators and shielding result in very large sources with @xmath510  m diameter and accordingly reduced flux density .",
    "we want to realize a new intense , brilliant neutron source by first populating weakly bound , neutron halo isomers which , after stopping , are used to release a directed , low - energy neutron beam when irradiating them with a second laser or an x - ray beam .",
    "let us first compare the brilliances of x - ray beams , neutron beams , and @xmath0 beams , which are all charge neutral .",
    "12.4 kev x - rays and 81.8 mev neutrons are penetrating particles with a wavelength of 1  that is matched to typical atomic distances in solids @xcite .",
    "a significant advantage of neutrons compared to x - rays is their interaction with nuclei and their magnetic moment .",
    "hence , neutrons are deeply penetrating and can be used for the investigation of structural and magnetic volume properties of materials on a microscopic scale . in particular , neutrons interact also strongly with light elements , a property that is important for investigating soft matter and biological materials .",
    "the comparison of the xfel @xcite and the european spallation source ess @xcite in view of the decision to install probably both large - scale facilities in europe indicates the complementarity between x - rays and neutron beams , although the brilliance of x - fels ( @xmath6/(mm@xmath7 mrad@xmath7 s ( 0.1%bw ) ) is some 30 orders of magnitude higher than that of the most intense neutron beams at the ill reactor @xcite , which provides neutron beams with @xmath8 /(mm@xmath7",

    "[ fig1a ] for the new neutron source envisaged for the eli - nuclear physics project @xcite using halo isomers and @xmath0-beams will be explained later .",
    "the comparison of the different neutron brilliances points to a major breakthrough in neutron physics if the two - step production process via neutron halo states proves successful .        .",
    "for the peak brilliance of spallation sources we increased the maximum average brilliance of a reactor by a factor of 100 .",
    "only the rough energy dependence of the brilliances are relevant , since details depend on the reflectivities of neutron guides .",
    "also the expected brilliances for the new @xmath10 sources using halo isomers are shown in red , where the curves represent rough order of magnitude estimates . ]    currently , thermal and cold neutron beams are extracted as continuous beams from nuclear reactors or as pulsed beams from spallation sources . in both cases",
    "the primarily produced neutrons have an energy of several mev .",
    "therefore , to make them useful for experiments in solid - state physics , they are moderated to thermal energies by elastic scattering in heavy water ( thermal neutrons ) , liquid hydrogen or deuterium ( cold neutrons ) , or other moderators .",
    "a typical moderator of a nuclear research reactor like the frm ii in garching or the ill in grenoble consists of a tank with a radius of approximately 1 m of heavy water , where the very small absorption cross section for neutrons and the similar masses of the neutrons and the moderator are decisive for an optimum performance of the moderation process .",
    "this tank is surrounded by a second tank of light water for shielding and cooling purposes .",
    "the neutron intensity of a high - flux reactor for neutron research is about @xmath11n / s @xcite corresponding to an optical light source or a candle of 200 mw , if one replaces the neutrons by photons ",
    "illustrating that the presently available intensity of neutrons is very small when compared with an x - ray tube or a laser .",
    "the neutrons are then extracted by beam tubes pointing towards the moderator followed by neutron guides . including the biological shielding , the neutrons can be used after traversing a distance of approximately 5 m , i.e. they exit through a surface of @xmath12 cm@xmath7 , resulting in a typical overall flux @xmath14n/(cm@xmath7s ) .",
    "the neutron moderators typically emit radiation into a solid angle of @xmath151 sterad .",
    "if one takes this solid angle into account , this compares well with the flux of beam line h12 at the ill given in the yellow book @xcite by @xmath16 n/(cm@xmath7s ) .    at spallation sources ,",
    "the liquid mercury target for neutron production is hit by a pulsed proton beam with a repetition rate of typically 50 hz and 1 gev energy .",
    "it is expected that future spallation sources will reach up to 5 mw target power , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal power of larger research reactors .",
    "the average target design flux of the ess is @xmath17n/(cm@xmath7s ) , which is a factor of 5 smaller than , e.g. , the flux of the beam line v4 at the ill reactor with @xmath18n/(cm@xmath7s ) . since the geometrical extraction efficiency of a spallation source @xcite is somewhat better than that of a reactor , the average extracted neutron flux may be only a factor of 2 lower than that of a reactor",
    "however , the peak brilliance is about a factor of 100 higher @xcite .",
    "spallation sources as well as reactors produce large amounts of radioactivity due to the high - energy neutrons and the fission and fragmentation products .",
    "moreover , they require large amounts of shielding , safety and security precautions . therefore , the direct production of neutrons using @xmath0-rays is a very attractive rather low - cost solution for the investigation of materials , when small and highly brilliant beams are required .    -beam exciting the neutron halo isomers of neutron separation energy @xmath19 below the binding energy @xmath20 .",

    "the two blue arrows indicate the width of the @xmath0 beam . then in a second step , a photon beam of much lower energy , shown in red , generates the neutron beam by dissociating the neutron halo state . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show schematically the new neutron beam production scheme , where we want to produce a brilliant pulsed neutron beam directly without moderation by exciting in a first step the neutron halo isomers at excitation energies just below the neutron separation threshold via a @xmath0-capture reaction using brilliant @xmath0-beams of 6 - 8 mev .",
    "a neutron halo isomer is a longer - lived nuclear state , where one neutron of the nucleus is excited into a very weakly bound configuration , being long - lived and extending into regions far away from the nuclear core .",
    "the narrow band width of the @xmath0-beam is essential for a selective production of the isomers .",
    "the @xmath21,n ) reaction above threshold is suppressed due to a phase space factor in neutron production . in a second step ,",
    "the neutrons of these halo isomers are effectively released by a second intense laser or photon beam of narrow band width due to the large cross section , producing a brilliant neutron beam .",
    "such a concept only became feasible due to the development of very brilliant @xmath0-beams , where the @xmath0-rays are produced by incoherent compton back - scattering of laser light from brilliant high - energy electron bunches .",

    "a small band width of the @xmath0-beam requires a small energy spread of the electron bunches @xmath29 , a small band width of the laser energy @xmath30 , a very good emittance of the electron beam with a small opening and a small opening angle of the laser beam .    at the hi@xmath0s facility ( duke university , usa ) the primary photons",
    "are produced by an fel using undulators and electrons from a storage ring .",
    "then in a second step these fel - photons are back - scattered from the circulating electron beam @xcite .",
    "c.  barty and his group at the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) developed already three generations of incoherent compton back - scattering sources : pleiades @xcite , t - rex @xcite and mega - ray @xcite , each based on a `` warm '' electron linac and a fibre laser for back - scattering .",

    "a very low normalized emittance of 0.1 mm mrad can be obtained from the electron gun . for the back - scattered laser light",

    "a one - step neutron production process , i.e. releasing the neutrons in a @xmath10 reaction just above the neutron binding energy is rather inefficient because the nucleus acquires from the high - energy @xmath0 quantum a recoil energy @xmath31 according to    @xmath32    for mass number a=180 and @xmath33 7 mev , we obtain @xmath34 = 500 mev . thus also the emitted neutron acquires a recoil energy in @xmath0 direction of 500 mev , which is rather large compared to the 25 mev of thermal neutrons . only for a very small emission opening angle ,",
    "small neutron energies could be obtained , where the @xmath0 recoil momentum is compensated . using the neutron halo isomers , which are stopped in the target within a few ps , the @xmath0-recoil problem can be avoided .    in the following we",
    "first ( section 2 ) describe the expected properties of neutron halo states , their production , dissociation , and experiments for a first direct observation of neutron halo isomers in stable nuclei . in section 3",
    "we discuss the properties of the new neutron beams like flux and brilliance . in section 4",
    "we show possible experiments with the new neutron beam .",
    "the concept of a neutron halo nucleus exists for more than 50 years . a weakly bound neutron can tunnel out of the nuclear potential with the short - range forces into a large volume of free space . due to the small binding energy the wave function by the uncertainty principle can reach out far into classically forbidden regions .",
    "a halo state is quite different from an atomic rydberg state , where long - range coulomb forces allow for an extended wave function of an electron with weak binding in classically allowed regions . in nuclear physics",
    "the front runner of the halo nucleus concept was the deuteron .",
    "the spin s=1 deuteron ground state with a neutron separation energy @xmath35=2.2246 mev has a halo radius a = 4.3 fm which is much larger than the radius of r=2.0 fm for the triplet nuclear potential between neutron and proton with a depth @xmath36 = -36 mev @xcite .",
    "thus the nucleons in the deuteron spend only one third of the time within the range of the nuclear forces and two thirds of the time they are at distances larger than r.      starting in 1983 with @xmath37be @xcite and @xmath37li @xcite , a whole region of light , extremely neutron - rich halo nuclei was studied , establishing halos for , e.g. , @xmath38he,@xmath37li , @xmath37be , @xmath39be , and @xmath40b @xcite .",
    "one of the best examples for a neutron halo nucleus is @xmath37be , where the ground state 2s@xmath41 has a neutron separation energy @xmath35=0.50 mev and a radius of 6.0 fm , while the first and only excited @xmath42 state has a neutron separation energy @xmath35=0.18 mev and a radius of 5.7 fm .",
    "these radii are large compared to the radius of the nuclear core of r=2.5 fm @xcite .",
    "these halo states are predominantly single particle states , where most physics is dominated by the external asymptotic wave function .     for woods - saxon potential of neutron halo state with n=4 nodes and angular momentum l=0 .",

    "we have compiled expected halo isomers .",
    "we give the excitation energy ( @xmath65 , @xmath35 ) for the situation with an excited nuclear core and for the core ground state , assuming that the @xmath1 neutron has zero separation energy .",
    "for most nuclei the isomer may have a higher separation energy and correspondingly a lower excitation energy .",
    "for other nuclei the neutron may be unbound and no halo isomer exists .",
    "the neutron binding energies were taken from the compilation of ref .",
    "we have also listed the spins and parities of the halo isomers for the case with an excited nuclear core and the case after the deexcitation of the core .",
    "the lifetime of the core excited state will be comparable to the halo isomer lifetime .",
    "next we estimate the cross sections for the photonuclear reaction and the width @xmath66 .",
    "the cross section for a compound nucleus resonance populated by photoexcitation at the resonance energy @xmath67 in the region of the neutron separation energy @xmath35 is given by the breit - wigner formula @xcite    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is a spin factor for the spin of the target and the beam and @xmath70 represents the wavelength of the @xmath0 rays with energy @xmath28 .",

    "the @xmath66 width has been studied systematically as a function of @xmath73 at the neutron separation energy @xcite and we obtain @xmath74 100 mev for nuclei with @xmath75 .",
    "the e1 hindrance factor of @xmath76 is within a reasonable range but may fluctuate between different levels .",
    "frequently the maximum cross section times the width is reported , which in our case for compound states is about 10 b@xmath77ev . however",
    ", a halo state with a typical single particle e1 strength has a much larger e1 excitation width of typically 1 kev and an integrated cross section of @xmath78b@xmath77ev .",
    "thus even if the halo state fractionates into several components the strong components will be populated strongly .",
    "the requirement of the halo state to have a rather small binding energy limits the number of states into which it fractionates .",
    "the energy spacing of the compound nucleus resonances for a given spin and parity at the neutron binding energy for a=180 is about d@xmath15 1 ev @xcite .    for about 60 different isotopes",
    "we have a chance of populating a halo isomer .",
    "now the challenging question will be : what is the lowest binding energy and thus the best halo isomer ?",
    "does it have a separation energy @xmath19 of 1 ev or 1 kev ?",
    "the doppler broadening of a @xmath0 transition at room temperature @xmath79 ev for a nucleus with mass number @xmath80 and a @xmath0 energy @xmath28= 8 mev is    @xmath81    thus the line is broadened with respect to the @xmath0 beam by a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "cooling the target to low temperatures is advantageous , because then we obtain much larger maximum resonance cross sections and can use correspondingly thinner targets . on the other hand ,",
    "the broadening of the second low - energy photon beam is negligible .",
    "thus we can produce rather monoenergetic neutrons in the second excitation .",
    "the photodissociation of the halo nucleus is described by the same formulas as for the deuteron @xcite    @xmath83    due to the change from an s- to a p - wave function , we find an energy dependence for the cross section of ( excess energy above threshold)@xmath84 from the phase space factor .",
    "the p - wave neutrons are emitted into a @xmath85 cone . due to the small separation energy @xmath35 , and the large charge z , the cross section",
    "is strongly enlarged compared to the maximum cross section of the deuteron photodissociation of 2 mb .",
    "for @xmath86 we reach this maximum cross section @xmath87 . for the large electric field of the coherent photon beam a much more polarized configuration with a more peaked neutron distribution",
    "is obtained .      for a first identification of halo isomers ,",
    "we want to measure the delayed @xmath0 decay of the isomers and their lifetimes .",
    "other isomers at lower excitation energies may be used for lifetime calibration .",
    "if in the future @xmath0-beams with smaller band width become available , these halo isomers can be populated more selectively . while the prompt @xmath0-decay of the polarized target ( due to the excitation with the polarized @xmath0-beam ) shows a pronounced angular distribution with minima for the very short - lived compound nuclear resonances , the polarization of the halo isomers , due to their lifetime ,",
    "will be partly lost , allowing a detection with less background in the minima of the prompt @xmath0 angular distributions .",
    "thus the @xmath0-decay measurements should allow for a convincing identification of possible halo isomers .",
    "experimentally , we first want to identify the new class of neutron halo isomers by their unique delayed @xmath0-cascade . once we have identified some of these isomers , a more systematic search guided by a matched theory will become possible and we will be able to explore their properties .    in a later second step , the release of the weakly bound neutrons could be studied using a @xmath88 kev x - ray beam , produced in parallel from the electron bunches with an undulator . here the neutron emission in the direction of the e - field of the undulator radiation , the neutron spectrum and angular distribution could be measured , leading to a first realization of this principle for a new neutron beam .",
    "let us now roughly estimate the flux and brilliance of this micro - neutron beam : while we start with @xmath89-quanta / s of about 7 mev and a band width of about 7 kev ( @xmath90 ) , we excite compound nucleus resonances with a width of @xmath5 100 mev and thus should end up with an intensity of @xmath91 isomers / s in a target spot of @xmath50.1 mm diameter .",
    "the p - wave neutrons are emitted with ( 100 mrad)@xmath7 opening angle and a band width better than 0.1% .",
    "thus we estimate a rough average brilliance of @xmath92/[(mm mrad)@xmath7 0.1% bw s ] .",
    "we reduce this value by one order of magnitude to @xmath93/[(mm mrad)@xmath7 0.1% bw s ] , because we may not always reach 0.1% bw .",
    "this is about 2 orders of magnitude better than the best average brilliance of a reactor , e.g. the h12 beam line of the ill reactor @xcite . due to the target isomer thickness of @xmath51 mm ( required to absorb all resonant photons of the compound nuclear resonance ) and the slow movement of the neutron with about 2000  m / s ,",
    "the monoenergetic neutron beam will be pulsed with 1@xmath4s pulse duration .",
    "thus the peak brilliance will be further increased by a factor of @xmath94 compared to the average brilliance reaching a peak brilliance of @xmath95/[(mm mrad)@xmath7 0.1% bw s ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) .",
    "for a 1 kev halo isomer it would be more difficult to realize a second @xmath0-beam with an energy of 1 kev , which strikes the target 1 ns after the first @xmath0-beam of about 7 mev for the production of the neutron halo isomers . in principle",
    ", such a second x - ray beam could be realized again with a band width of @xmath96 .",
    "thus we would obtain a neutron beam facility with the same flux and brilliance , however requiring not a laser but a second x - ray beam .",
    "if such a neutron beam facility would be realized , many parameters could be further optimized .",
    "the neutron pulse duration of @xmath97s was determined by the target thickness .",
    "one could envision a stack of many much thinner neutron halo isomer layers , providing a macro - bunch of neutrons with micro - bunches of much shorter duration , ns instead of @xmath4s .",
    "however , then also the target thickness has to be very small ( nm ) , to avoid a larger delay and spread of the neutron pulse when crossing the target .",
    "the intense , brilliant second photon beam together with the large halo cross section can be used to transfer part of its high brilliance to the neutron beam .",
    "a suitable chirp of this laser can improve the band width of the neutron beam , making also use of the energy dependence of the photodissociation cross section .",
    "also different effective target thicknesses with respect to the @xmath0-beam and the second photon beam can improve the brilliance by tilting the target .",
    "if we find neutron isomers with a very low binding energy , extremely monoenergetic or extremely cold neutron beams could be launched with monoenergetic laser pulses of longer duration .    for a coherent photon field of the second beam a much more directed neutron emission in the laser polarization direction may occur due to the collective alignment of the charged core nucleus with respect to the halo neutron and due to the large dipole moment , resulting in @xmath98 times higher brilliances . by the direction of the @xmath99-field of the second photon beam , releasing the neutrons , we can select into which neutron guide the neutrons are injected . for the flux and brilliance estimates of the neutron beam , we used a @xmath0-intensity of @xmath89-quanta / s , while with the 100 ma erl a 500 times higher flux and a 50 times smaller band width come into reach , increasing the neutron yield further by @xmath98 . thus @xmath100 times better neutron beams compared to the conservative estimates of fig .",

    "if we excite from a @xmath101 nuclear groundstate the fully polarised @xmath102 halo isomers , we obtain fully polarized neutrons , because of their orbital angular momentum l=0 . by switching the polarisation of the primary laser beam , we can switch from shot to shot the polarisation of the neutron beam .",
    "since the spin of the neutron is coupled to its magnetic dipole moment the detailed manipulation of the polarisation of the neutron beam becomes available .",

[ fig1a ] ) , i.e. they have large cross section of typically 50 mm@xmath104 mm and low divergence . when adapting the beam size to a typical sample size of the order of 10 mm@xmath105 mm using focusing guides , the flux can be increased , however , due to liouville s theorem , the divergence is increased as well  @xcite .",
    "therefore , experiments requiring an excellent momentum resolution like sans and reflectometry can not profit much from focusing .",
    "it is exactly the high brilliance of the proposed @xmath0-beam facility for the production of neutrons that may lead to major improvements in future neutron scattering techniques similarly as it occurred with the invention of synchrotron sources in the field of x - ray scattering .    as described above , the second photon beam releases the neutrons from the isomer target into a very small solid angle depending on the polarization direction of the second photon beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the neutrons will feed elliptic or parabolic neutron guides that transport the neutrons to the various beam lines for neutron scattering and imaging ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "these neutron guides can tolerate a high neutron flux and do not transport higher energy neutrons .",
    "since the e - field of the second photon beam oscillates into opposite directions , we always feed to oppositely directed neutron guides at the same time , which should be designed for neutron beams with similar timing and energy structure .",
    "choppers may be used to further tailor the properties of the neutron beams . at the end of each neutron beam",
    "we place an efficient beam dump for thermal neutrons .",
    "a typical beam dump is shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where the neutrons are captured in boron carbide , while the low energy capture @xmath0 rays ( 0.5 mev ) are absorbed in tungsten .",
    "thus even at high neutron intensities an operation without complex radiation safety licensing procedures seems possible .",
    "basically , for parabolic or elliptic guides the transport of the neutrons involves only one reflection in contrast to straight guides , thus minimizing the reflection losses .",
    "these guides extract neutrons very effectively , because i ) only one reflection of neutrons is involved and ii ) the neutron target is located in the focal point of the guide system .",
    "the second focal point of the elliptic guides will be either the position of a chopper , the position of the sample , the virtual source of a focusing monochromator or the source for conical imaging @xcite .",
    "the direct line of sight to the target may be interrupted by means of a beam stop inside the guide . thus all other radiation originating from the converter target , like @xmath0 quanta or other neutrons are strongly suppressed . moreover ,",
    "the smearing of the time - structure of the ultra - sharp neutron beams is reduced , because the flight path of the neutrons does not depend on the divergence . for small - angle neutron scattering or reflectometry ,",
    "a parabolic guide geometry is more appropriate to expand the brilliant micro - beam to a larger size and to decrease its divergence .",
    "actually , by appropriate design of the guides , the phase space of the neutrons can be adapted to any beam size ranging from the size of the production target @xmath106 m to millimeters .",
    "using an advanced kirkpatrick - baez geometry for the guides @xcite , the beams may be effectively focused further down to a few @xmath107 m or less .        for an efficient extraction of the neutrons ,",
    "the guides have to start as close as possible to the converter target . here , the radiation load is very high and may lead to the destruction of the glass that is presently used as substrate for the neutron guides .",
    "recently it became possible to superpolish metal substrates of aluminum or iron to an atomic level @xcite allowing to start with the guides very close to the target . to further reduce the background from the converter target",
    ", one may tailor the guides such that only a limited wavelength band of neutrons is transmitted .",
    "this is achieved by using bandpass supermirrors , i.e. coatings with a laterally and perpendicularly changing @xmath108-spacing of the multilayer structure @xcite .        in order to compare the performance of the new source with a high - flux reactor , we assume that the converter target ( @xmath109 mm ) produces a neutron beam with a time averaged brilliance of @xmath93 neutrons/[(mm",
    "mrad)@xmath7 0.1% bw s ] being the source for an elliptic guide system feeding a neutron scattering experiment . the solid angle of the emitted neutrons is approximately @xmath110 mrad@xmath7 .",
    "we consider a beam line using neutrons with an energy of 81 mev ( @xmath111  ) .",
    "assuming supermirrors with index @xmath112 @xcite , the angle of total reflection of the supermirror is @xmath113 .",
    "an elliptic guide accepts neutrons with a divergence of at least @xmath114 , corresponding to a solid angle @xmath115 mrad@xmath116 .",
    "if a beam with a bandwidth of 2 mev is refocused on a spot with a diameter @xmath117 mm , we obtain a flux of @xmath118 /[(mm@xmath7)s ] and a divergence of @xmath119 .",
    "this is indeed an exceptionally high flux . for a beam size @xmath120 mm a similar estimate",
    "yields a flux of @xmath121/[(mm@xmath7)s ] and a very small divergence of @xmath122 .",
    "the upgraded triple axis spectrometer in8 at the ill provides a flux at the sample position of @xmath123/[(mm@xmath7)s ] for @xmath124  , however , with a very large divergence @xcite and poor energy resolution .",
    "therefore , the converter target may be competitive with continuous sources even for the investigation of large samples .",
    "the yield for pulsed neutron beam operation will be even higher : according to fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , the converter target will deliver orders of magnitude higher intensities than spallation sources even for large beams .",
    "next we compare the performance of the converter target for small angle neutron scattering . here , beams with a small divergence are essential . assuming a brilliance of @xmath125 neutrons/[(mm mrad)@xmath7 0.1% bw s ] at @xmath126   ( fig .",
    "[ fig1a]a ) , we end up with a flux of @xmath127/[(mm@xmath7)s ] for a beam size of 1 mm , a bandwidth @xmath128 , and a divergence of @xmath129 . for a sample size of 10 mm ,",
    "the flux decreases to @xmath130/[(mm@xmath7)s ] , however , with an excellent divergence as small as @xmath122 . for comparison",
    ", the flux at the sans - instrument kws-1 at the frm ii is quoted to be @xmath131/[(mm@xmath7)s ] @xmath132 /[(mm@xmath7)s ] depending on the resolution @xcite . clearly , the flux of sans at a converter target is comparable to equivalent beam lines at high - flux reactors .",
    "however , we have an intrinsically pulsed beam and in 10 years from now @xmath133 times better values might be achieved .",
    "the new type of neutron source can be operated in a pulsed mode as well as in a pseudo cw - mode .",
    "the former technique provides an overview of @xmath134 in a large area of @xmath135 and @xmath136-space , while the latter method is usually more appropriate for the detailed investigation of @xmath134 at particular positions in reciprocal space . because the pulse structure and the repetition frequency of the electron and photon sources involved can be easily adjusted in a wide range of parameters , the operation of the converter target can be well adapted to the requirements of the various beam lines . by switching the polarization of the @xmath137-field of the laser during operation , the various beam lines may be fed with neutrons continuously , however , at a lower pulse rate that might reduce the problem of frame overlap .",
    "last but not least , the possibility to fully polarize the neutrons during their production with polarized @xmath0-rays without loss of brilliance allows to study magnetic materials and soft materials with strong incoherent scattering . by analyzing the polarization of the scattered neutrons , information on the detailed orientation of the magnetic moments in the sample and their interaction with the lattice degrees of freedom can be studied .",
    "the new neutron facility opens a broad range of new possibilities for neutron physics .",
    "once successful , neutron sources could be built even at universities resulting in a large scientific community .",
    "if one compares the investment and running costs of the proposed neutron facility with the costs of reactors or spallation sources , they will be @xmath15 2 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "moreover , it is also tremendously cheaper than any proposed neutron source based on inertial fusion @xcite .",
    "the big advantage of the new facility is that it produces only small amounts of radioactivity and radioactive waste and thus requires only small efforts for radioprotection , i.e. , very different from present reactor or spallation facilities .",
    "the new source can be operated as a multi - user neutron facility and could be several orders of magnitude more brilliant than the best existing neutron sources .    the same electron linac and recycling loop could drive in parallel a brilliant x - ray and positron source , where a 2 - 3 mev @xmath0-beam via the @xmath138 reaction produces positrons in a converter target .",
    "such a positron source would be similar to the nepomuc positron source at the frm ii  @xcite , however , the @xmath0-rays would originate from a brilliant @xmath0-beam and not from neutron capture .",
    "this allows to address the same targets with very different beams and analyzing techniques and makes neutron sources using halo isomers a unique possibility .",
    "in particular , these new sources have the potential , similarly as 30 years ago the synchrotron sources for x - ray scattering , to increase the flux of neutron beams by orders of magnitude in the next decades to come .",
    "already with existing technologies , a neutron scattering facility based on halo isomers may deliver more intense beams for the investigation of small samples than today s most powerful neutron sources .    * acknowledgement",
