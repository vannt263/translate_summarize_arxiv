    "prior , and at around , the time the charmed baryons existence was confirmed @xcite a great theoretical activity developed in order to understand and predict their masses  @xcite , magnetic moments  @xcite , or decay properties  @xcite .",
    "this activity continued in the following decades .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath1 baryon at cern  @xcite , the discovery of most of the charmed baryons of the su(3 ) multiplet on the second level of the su(4 ) lowest 20-plet  @xcite , and the claims of indirect evidences for the semileptonic decays of @xmath1 and @xmath3  @xcite renewed the interest in the spectroscopy and weak decays of heavy baryons .",
    "there are eight lowest - lying baryons containing one heavy and two light quarks ( up , down , or strange ) .",
    "the quantum numbers of the charmed and bottom baryons are listed in table  [ tab : summ ] .    heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) has proved to be a useful tool to understand the bottom and charm physics  @xcite , and it has been extensively used to describe the dynamics of systems containing a heavy quark @xmath4 or @xmath5 . for instance ,",
    "all lattice qcd simulations rely on hqs to describe bottom systems  @xcite .",
    "hqs is an approximate su(@xmath6 ) symmetry of qcd , being @xmath6 the number of heavy flavors : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 , which appear in systems containing heavy quarks with masses that are much larger than the typical quantities ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) which set up the energy scale of the dynamics of the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "hqs has some resemblances , in atomic physics , to the approximate independence of the electron properties from the nuclear spin and mass , for a fixed nuclear charge . up to corrections of",
    "the order and @xmath9 are a typical energy scale relevant for the light degrees of freedom and the mass of the heavy quark , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath10 , hqs guaranties that the heavy baryon light degrees of freedom quantum numbers , compiled in table  [ tab : summ ] , are always well defined .",
    "the symmetry also predicts that the pair of baryons @xmath11 and @xmath12 or the pair @xmath13 and @xmath14 or the pair @xmath15 and @xmath16 become degenerated for an infinitely massive heavy quark , since both baryons have the same cloud of light degrees of freedom .",
    ".summary of the quantum numbers , experimental and lattice qcd masses of the baryons containing a single heavy quark .",
    "@xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the isospin , and the spin parity of the light degrees of freedom and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are strangeness and the spin parity of the baryon ( @xmath21 denotes a light quark of flavor @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "experimental masses are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and the isospin averaged masses are quoted , with errors counting for the mass differences between the members of the same isomultiplet .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    the use of heavy quark symmetry to study bottom and charmed baryons leads to important simplifications of the non - relativistic three body problem , which turns out to be easily solved by a simple variational ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> our simple scheme reproduces previous results ( baryon masses , charge and mass radii , @xmath0 ) obtained by solving the faddeev equations with simple non - relativistic quark  quark potentials , adjusted to the light and heavy  light meson spectra . </S>",
    "<S> wave functions , parameterized in a simple manner , are also given and thus they can be easily used to compute further observables . </S>",
    "<S> our method has been also used to find the predictions for strangeness - less baryons of the su(2 ) chirally inspired quark - quark interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the one pion exchange term of the chirally inspired interactions leads to relative changes of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 binding energies as large as 90% . </S>"
