    "in statistical physics , phase re - entrance is a quite typical phenomenon occurring in many physical systems , such as spin - glasses , colloids and polymers , in which there is a competition between different entropic terms @xcite .",
    "a phase re - entrance is normally associated with inverse melting , a counterintuitive phenomenon in which isobaric addition of heat causes a disordered ( e.g. , liquid ) phase to crystallize , the reverse of the usual situation .",
    "phase re - entrance occurs when , providing additional heating to the system , the latter undergoes a new transition , from the ordered to the disordered phase .",
    "the phenomenon of phase re - entrance has been widely studied at thermodynamic equilibrium in systems whose constituents interact through short - range forces .    in this paper",
    "we give evidence to the existence of phase re - entrance also in the case of long - range interacting systems in out - of - equilibrium dynamical conditions .",
    "long - range interactions are such that the two - body interaction potential decays at large distances with a power - law exponent which is smaller than the space dimension .",
    "the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of these systems were poorly understood until a few years ago , and their study was essentially restricted to astrophysics ( stellar systems ) and two - dimensional turbulence ( large - scale vortices ) @xcite .",
    "later , it was recognized that long - range systems exhibit universal , albeit unconventional , equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium features @xcite .",
    "it is for instance well known that such systems get trapped in long - lasting quasi - stationary states ( qss ) @xcite , before relaxing to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the duration of a qss increases with the number of particles @xmath0 in the system . remarkably , when the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath1 ) is performed before the infinite time limit ( @xmath2 ) , the system remains permanently trapped in qsss . as a consequence , qsss represent the only accessible experimental dynamical regimes for systems composed by a large number of long - range interacting particles .",
    "this includes systems of paramount importance , such as non - neutral plasmas confined by a strong magnetic field @xcite , free - electron lasers @xcite and ion particle beams @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of qsss has originated an intense debate @xcite about the mechanisms responsible for their emergence , their persistence , and their eventual evolution towards statistical equilibrium .",
    "in fact , qsss keep memory of the initial condition and , as a consequence , they can not be interpreted by making use of the classical boltzmann - gibbs approach .    in a series of recent papers @xcite ,",
    "an approximate analytical theory based on the vlasov equation and inspired by a seminal work of lynden - bell @xcite in astrophysics has been proposed .",
    "this is a fully predictive approach , enabling one to explain the emergence and the properties of qsss from first principles @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we utilize a well - known hamiltonian toy model , the so - called hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite , to demonstrate that phase re - entrance(s ) may also occur in a long - range interacting system , dynamically trapped in a qss .",
    "the hmf describes the motion of @xmath0 rotators , coupled through an equal strength cosine interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 represents the orientation of the @xmath5-th rotator and @xmath6 stands for its conjugated momentum . to monitor the evolution of the systems it is customary to introduce the magnetization ,",
    "an order parameter defined as @xmath7 the infinite - range coupling between rotators , provides the system with all typical characteristics of a long - range system , as clearly displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] . here , the magnetization is monitored as a function of time : after an initial `` violent '' relaxation , the system reaches a qss , which is followed by a slow relaxation towards boltzmann statistical equilibrium .",
    "the larger the system , the longer the intermediate phase where it remains confined before reaching the final equilibrium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we present the continuous vlasov picture and review the maximum entropy principle based on the lynden - bell approach . this theoretical",
    "setting is used to obtain the hmf phase diagrams in different representations from which out - of - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite and phase re - entrance @xcite can be predicted . in sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] , these theoretical predictions are compared to @xmath0-body simulations based on . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] we sum up our results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , an approximate analytical theory based on the vlasov equation has been proposed for the hmf model stemming from the seminal work of lynden - bell @xcite .",
    "this is a fully predictive approach , justified from first principles , which captures most of the peculiar traits of the hmf out - of - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the philosophy of the proposed approach is reviewed in the following .    in the limit of @xmath8",
    ", the hmf dynamics can be formally described using the vlasov equation @xmath9 \\sin \\theta - m_y[f]\\cos \\theta \\right ) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}=0 , \\label{eq : vlasovhmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the one - body microscopic distribution function ( df ) , and the two components of the magnetization are respectively given by @xmath11&=&\\int f \\cos",
    "\\theta d\\theta dp , \\\\ m_y[f]&=&\\int f \\sin \\theta d\\theta dp . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mean field energy can be expressed as @xmath12 working in this setting , it can be then hypothesized that qsss correspond to stable stationary equilibria of the vlasov equation on a coarse - grained scale .",
    "lynden - bell s idea goes as follows .",
    "the vlasov dynamics induces a progressive filamentation of the initial single particle distribution profile , i.e. the continuous counterpart of the discrete @xmath0-body distribution , which proceeds at smaller and smaller scales without reaching an equilibrium .",
    "conversely , at a coarse - grained level , the process comes to an end , and the distribution function @xmath13 , averaged over a finite grid , eventually converges to an asymptotic form . following lynden - bell , one can then associate a mixing entropy to this process . assuming ergodicity ( i.e. , efficient mixing ) , @xmath14 ,",
    "is obtained by maximizing the mixing entropy , while imposing the conservation of vlasov dynamical invariants .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the prediction of the qss depends on the details of the initial condition @xcite , not only on the values of energy and mass as for the boltzmann statistical equilibrium state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the vlasov equation admits an infinite number of invariants , i.e. the casimirs or , equivalently , the moments @xmath15 of the fine - grained distribution function .",
    "the first moment @xmath16 is just the normalization of the distribution function , and we can refer to it as the conservation of the total mass .    in the case of a two - levels initial condition , where the fine - grained df takes only two values @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the invariants reduce to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , since the moments @xmath21 can all be expressed in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 . for the specific case at hand ,",
    "the lynden - bell entropy is then explicitly constructed from the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath24 and reads @xcite : @xmath25=-\\int \\!\\!{\\mathrm d}p{\\mathrm d}\\theta \\ , \\left[\\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0 } \\ln \\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0 } + \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0}\\right)\\ln \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0}\\right)\\right ] .",

    "let us now insert expression into the energy and normalization constraints and use the definition of magnetization .",
    "further , defining @xmath34 and @xmath35 yields : , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the functions @xmath41 in @xcite are related to the fermi integrals by @xmath42 . ]",
    "@xmath43 where we have defined the fermi integrals @xmath44 its asymptotic limits are recalled in @xcite .",

    "then , using eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) , we can determine the range of corresponding energies . specifically , the critical curve @xmath70 separating stable and unstable homogeneous lynden - bell distributions is given by the parametric equations @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath53 goes from @xmath72 ( completely degenerate ) to @xmath73 ( non degenerate ) .",
    "in fact , the criterion ( [ vs7 ] ) only proves that @xmath74 is a _ local _ entropy maximum at fixed mass and energy . if several local entropy maxima are found ( for example , homogeneous and inhomogeneous lynden - bell distributions )",
    ", we must compare their entropies to determine the stable state ( global entropy maximum ) and the metastable states ( secondary entropy maxima ) . for systems with long - range interactions , metastable states",
    "have in general very long lifetimes , scaling like @xmath75 , so that they are stable in practice and must absolutely be taken into account @xcite .",
    "for this reason , ( out - of - equilibrium ) stability diagrams do not coincide with phase diagrams .",
    "in fact , the latter require a careful investigation of metastable states .      the phase diagram of the lynden - bell distribution in the @xmath76 plane is shown in fig . [ muepsilon ] .",

    "the homogeneous phase is stable ( maximum entropy state ) and on the right of this curve it is unstable ( saddle point of entropy ) . which is the maximum entropy state ( most mixed ) in that case .",
    "another possibility , always to consider , is that the system does not converge towards the maximum entropy state , i.e. the relaxation is incomplete @xcite . ] for @xmath68 , we are in the non - degenerate limit @xmath47 and the stability criterion ( [ vs7 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath79 . using eq .",

    "( [ min2 ] ) . combining these equations ,",
    "we find that the absolute minimum energy @xmath181 is given in parametric form by @xmath202 @xmath203 with @xmath204 . for @xmath68 ( non degenerate limit )",
    ", we get @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "this is the energy corresponding to an initial condition @xmath207 .    _",
    "remark : _ for @xmath208 , we confirm on fig . [",
    "fig : min ] that there can exists several initial conditions with the same @xmath55 and @xmath20 but a different initial magnetization @xmath125 .",
    "they lead to the _ same _ lynden - bell prediction .",
    "to assess the correctness of the above theoretical prediction about the existence of a phase re - entrance , we have performed direct numerical simulations of the hmf model for finite @xmath0 .",
    "for that , we have chosen @xmath55 in the interval @xmath209 and ran simulations at different energies .",
    "results , for @xmath210 , are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : confr0 ] , where both the theoretical and numerical values of magnetization at the qss , @xmath211 , are plotted as a function of energy .    simulations ( dashed line ) confirm the existence of a regime of phase re - entrance .",
    "however , the agreement with theory ( continuous line ) is mainly qualitative , as there is a systematic shift between the two curves , although the magnetization value of the main bump is consistent with the one predicted from lynden - bell s approach .",
    "moreover , simulations show the existence of two zones of magnetization revival at both sides of the central magnetized region .",
    "if we move at @xmath55 = @xmath212 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : confr2 ] ) , we find that one of the two bumps has grown ; this confirms that the structure of the phase diagram is more complex than predicted by the theory , as we find the existence of additional phase re - entrances .",
    "simulations performed using different numbers of particles show that the magnetization values of the central magnetized region and of the two bumps do not depend on the system size .",
    "instead , as expected , the curve offset goes to zero when the system size is increased , see fig .",
    "[ fig : confr2 ] .    a possible explanation for the discrepancies between theory and simulations can be found by considering that the energy range in which phase - rentrance is observed is quite narrow .",
    "in fact , the iso-@xmath55 lines , in the interval @xmath209 , are very close to the theoretical phase - transition curve , see fig . [",
    "fig : dfiso ] .",
    "this means that any possible ( i.e. , even small ) disagreement between the theoretical and the numerical one may easily lead : a ) to a further numerical phase re - entrance , if the iso-@xmath55 line crosses the numerical phase - transitions curves without crossing the theoretical one ; b ) to a larger numerical value of @xmath211 , if the iso-@xmath55 separates from the numerical curve , while staying close to the theoretical one .",
    "we also compared theory and simulations for higher @xmath55 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confr ] , here theoretical and numerical results are close .",
    "this is in agreement with what is reported in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : confr3 ] we plotted our numerical results for a @xmath55 lower than @xmath214 . for @xmath215 , close to the critical line @xmath70 , we observe a magnetized phase although lynden - bell s approach predicts a non - magnetized phase . for lower values of @xmath22 , homogeneous qss",
    "are observed in agreement with the theoretical prediction ( data not shown ) .    to provide a complete picture of the whole phase diagram",
    ", we carried out simulations on a grid in the @xmath76 plane and plotted the numerically obtained values of @xmath211 in color scale , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_di_col ] . at first order",
    ", we observe a fair agreement between theory and simulations . in particular , the predicted re - entrant phase phenomenon is clearly observed .",
    "this can be considered as a success of the lynden - bell theory .",
    "we also note that the region ( iii ) of the phase diagram appears to be non - magnetized .",
    "it corresponds therefore to a local lynden - bell entropy maximum .",
    "this confirms our claim about the robustness of metastable states .",
    "note , however , that starting from different initial conditions ( with identical values of @xmath20 and @xmath22 ) , we could have found that the qsss in this region are magnetized .",
    "indeed , in the metastability region , the selection between between local ( metastable ) or global ( state ) entropy maxima depends on a complicated notion of basin of attraction .",
    "furthermore , we also find some unpredicted phenomena , as the additional phase re - entrance , for @xmath216 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : confr2 ] ) and a persisting magnetized phase for low @xmath55 ( also fig .",
    "[ fig : confr3 ] ) .",
    "we also studied the order of phase transitions , by plotting the probability histogram of @xmath211 sampled with @xmath217 different realizations .",
    "we show the results for two of the transitions occurring in fig .",
    "[ fig : confr2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi1 ] , one can see that for the transition at @xmath218 , distributions are characterized by a double peak , which is a clear signature of a first - order phase transition . for the one at @xmath219 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : multi2 ] , the distributions are instead characterized by a single peak , which validates the prediction of a second - order phase transition .",
    "the two transitions at the boundaries of the smaller phase re - entrance , occurring around @xmath220 , not predicted by the theory , are found to be of first ( at low energy ) and second ( at high energy ) order ( data not shown ) .    finally , we compared the analytical and numerical caloric curves @xmath221 for a given value of @xmath22 . in the simulations ,",
    "the temperature has been calculated from the usual expression @xmath222 we note that the `` kinetic '' temperature defined by eq .",
    "( [ bl ] ) does not coincide with the lagrange multiplier @xmath54 associated to the energy conservation in the lynden - bell distribution ( [ eq : barf ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fermionic nature of this distribution .",
    "therefore , in order to make the comparison between simulations and theory relevant , we have calculated the theoretical temperature from the mean square momentum ( [ bl ] ) averaged with the lynden - bell distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : barf ] ) .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_cal ] . in continuity with the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : confr0 ] , the range of energies where the inhomogeneous phase appears is shifted with respect to the theoretical prediction .",
    "as a further point , we also notice the presence of a region with negative specific heat , both in the numerical and analytical curves . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time negative specific heat is observed out of equilibrium .",
    "surprisingly , this phenomenon is here observed in correspondence of a second order transition line .",
    "in this paper , we have confronted the predictions @xcite of a theory based on lynden - bell s statistical mechanics of violent relaxation @xcite to the results of numerical experiments .",
    "the application of lynden - bell s theory to the hmf model predicts a re - entrant phase in the @xmath76 plane @xcite and , indeed , we observe it .",
    "it occurs for a narrow range of parameters which would have been difficult to find without such a theoretical prediction . in this sense",
    ", this is a great success of lynden - bell s approach .",
    "the theory also predicts the correct value of the magnetization in the inhomogeneous phase and the correct order of the phase transition .",
    "this is again remarkable because the phase diagram displays first and second order phase transitions in a very narrow range of parameters @xmath76 .",
    "all these predictions are confirmed by direct @xmath0-body experiments .",
    "we have also numerically observed that metastable states ( local lynden - bell entropy maxima ) can be very robust , so that they are stable in practice .",
    "this is a specificity of systems with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "however , we have also found some discrepancies with respect to lynden - bell s theory . in particular ,",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated the existence of second re - entrant phases : a band of un - magnetized states in the theoretically magnetized region , as well as persisting magnetized states in the theoretically un - magnetized region . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is a systematic shift of the transition line with respect to theory .",
    "we must emphasize , however , the very small selected region of parameters in figs .",
    "[ fig : confr0 ] and [ fig : ph_di_col ] .",
    "this gives the impression of a big discrepancy although the discrepancy is in fact very small .",
    "therefore , from these numerical experiments , we can conclude that the lynden - bell statistical theory gives a fair first order description of qsss in the hmf model .",
    "however , for some initial conditions , there can be more or less severe discrepancies with respect to the prediction .",
    "this is a well - known fact in stellar dynamics @xcite and vortex dynamics @xcite to which this theory was initially applied ( see a detailed discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "discrepancies with the lynden - bell theory have also been reported for the hmf model in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are usually the result of an _ incomplete relaxation _ @xcite ,",
    "i.e. a lack of efficient mixing in the system phase space .",
    "indeed , the lynden - bell theory is based on a hypothesis of ergodicity and the prediction fails ( by definition ) if the evolution is not ergodic . a detailed understanding of incomplete violent relaxation is still lacking and appears to be very difficult @xcite .",
    "another cause of discrepancy may be related to the proximity of the numerically considered parameters @xmath150 to the critical line and to the tricritical point .",
    "indeed , it is well - known in equilibrium statistical mechanics that strong fluctuations are present close to a critical point , and that the mean field results cease to be valid in the vicinity of a critical point @xcite . in the present case",
    ", we are studying out - of - equilibrium phase transitions and it is not clear if we can directly extend equilibrium results to that situation .",
    "nevertheless , it is not unreasonable to expect that the theoretical results may be altered close to the critical line and this is indeed what we observe numerically . further away from the critical line ( i.e. for larger or smaller values of @xmath55 )",
    ", we find a very good agreement with the lynden - bell prediction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these different observations concerning the success or the failure of the lynden - bell theory are consistent with the discussion given in @xcite .",
