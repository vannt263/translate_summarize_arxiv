    "a consistent and reliable description of the low - temperature behavior of strongly correlated electron systems has not yet been reached in spite of decades of intensive research in this field .",

    "the problems arise when one tries to extend fermi - liquid solutions to the strong - coupling regime .",
    "fermi liquid becomes unstable due to quantum dynamical fluctuations and the electron system approaches a quantum critical point for a sufficiently strong interaction .",
    "non - perturbative approaches are then needed .",
    "one option is to use unbiased numerical simulations that are not restricted to weak coupling .",
    "various variants of quantum monte carlo,@xcite or numerical,@xcite density matrix@xcite or functional@xcite renormalization group , are widely used to obtain quantitative non - perturbative results in the whole range of the interaction strength .",

    "moreover , they address primarily one - electron functions .",
    "proximity of the critical points demands , however , controlling two - particle and response functions that , unlike the one - particle ones , may diverge at the critical point .",
    "the singularities in two - particle functions and the critical , non - analytic behavior can be identified and fully controlled only analytically .",
    "the singularities and divergencies must be treated separately from the non - divergent quantities so that to reach stable solutions and to avoid spurious behavior in numerical calculations and iterations .",
    "analytic approaches are generally based on a many - body perturbation , diagrammatic expansion in the interaction strength .",
    "they work well in the weak - coupling , fermi - liquid regime . to extend them beyond weak electron correlations one needs to sum infinite series of specific classes of diagrams and make the approximations non - perturbative and self - consistent .",
    "self - consistency can not be introduced in an arbitrary manner , since there is a danger that some of the macroscopic conservation laws be broken . the canonical way how to achieve conserving and thermodynamically consistent approximations",
    "was outlined by baym and kadanoff.@xcite when an approximation can be derived from a generating luttinger - ward functional of the full one - particle propagator , the continuity equation holds and mass is conserved .",
    "the fundamental quantities in the baym - kadanoff construction are the generating functional , the one - particle propagator , and the self - energy .",
    "the two - particle vertex functions are not explicitly addressed and are determined via functional derivatives from the self - energy , treated as a functional of the renormalized one - electron propagator .",
    "the renormalization in the baym - kadanoff construction does renormalize the bare interaction.@xcite consequently , there is no direct control of singularities in the bethe - salpeter equations for the two - particle functions . to circumvent this problem a so - called parquet scheme",
    "was introduced taking into account also renormalizations of two - particle vertices.@xcite the renormalization of the unperturbed propagator and the bare interaction must be made in a coordinated way so that not to break macroscopic continuity equation.@xcite even if we guarantee mass conservation in the theory with renormalized one and two - particle functions , we are unable to match the irreducible vertex derived from the self - energy via the functional ward identity with the full vertex used in the schwinger - dyson equation.@xcite this inconsistency was first met already earlier when attempting to go beyond the weak - coupling theory of superconductivity of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs).@xcite when the fully self - consistent t - matrix approximation ( tma ) , conserving in the baym - kadanoff sense , is used to renormalize multiple electron - electron scatterings of the bcs theory , the pole in the two - particle correlation function does not lead to opening of the superconducting gap.@xcite to resolve the problem a variety of modifications of tma combining self - consistent and bare propagators have been proposed.@xcite these attempts to resolve the inconsistency of the fully self - consistent tma are mostly ad hoc suggestions that lack the solid basis on which one could systematically build up further improvements .",

    "critical behavior there is indicated by a singularity in a bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the principal new idea of our construction is to use the irreducible vertex from the singular bethe - salpeter equation , instead of the self - energy , as a generating function obtained from a diagrammatic perturbation expansion .",
    "we solve a linearized ward identity for the given irreducible vertex to determine a thermodynamic self - energy .",
    "we introduce self - consistency into the diagrammatic expansion by renormalizing the one - particle propagators by the thermodynamic self - energy . in this way",
    "we achieve a consistency between the divergence in the bethe - salpeter equation and the corresponding symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic self - energy .",
    "approximate irreducible vertices do not , however , guarantee that this thermodynamic self - energy fulfills the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "it can actually be achieved only in the exact dynamical solution for the irreducible vertex that is far beyond reach .",
    "the physical self - energy is nevertheless the one fulfilling the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "we hence introduce another self - energy from the schwinger - dyson equation that we call spectral .",
    "the one - particle propagators in the schwinger - dyson equation do not change their renormalization in this definition .",
    "it means that the spectral self - energy no longer enters a self - consistency loop .",
    "the spectral self - energy is the principal output of the theory and is used to determine all physical and measurable quantities . in this way the corresponding symmetry of the one - electron propagator with the spectral self - energy gets broken at the critical point of the bethe - salpeter equation and the respective response function .",
    "the presentation of our construction consists of four hierarchical levels . in the first one we identify the origin of the failure of the @xmath0-derivable approximations to match the symmetry breaking in the self - energy with the singularity in a bethe - salpeter equation ( sec .",
