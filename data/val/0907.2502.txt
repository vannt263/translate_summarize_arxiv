    "carnot efficiency is one of the cornerstones of thermodynamics since it leads to the definition of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "it expresses a fundamental limitation on how much work can be extracted from a heat flow .",
    "a less studied but arguably more relevant question for many isothermal chemical and biological processes is how much chemical energy a system can extract from its environment by increasing the system s configurational entropy .",
    "thermodynamics does , in fact , also prescribe a limit , even though at first sight it appears to be almost trivial : the energy extracted by such an isothermal transfer can be carried out with @xmath1 efficiency .",
    "however , there is a crucial additional condition , namely , that this efficiency can only be reached  just as in the case of carnot efficiency  by a reversible , infinitely slow process .",
    "hence @xmath1 efficiency is achieved for a process with zero power output .",
    "the question of efficiencies at finite power should thus be addressed .    in the context of thermal machines , a straightforward analysis based on _ linear _ irreversible thermodynamics teaches us that , as one moves away from the reversible regime , the power goes through a unique maximum , and that the efficiency at this maximum is , at most , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the same argument can easily be extended to the transformation between different forms of chemical energy .",
    "however , the above prediction may not apply for several reasons .",
    "first , the point of maximum power does not necessarily lie in the linear regime .",
    "second , thermodynamic nonlinear effects can give rise to bifurcated branches .",
    "finally , the above - mentioned efficiency is attained upon maximization with respect to the thermodynamic force associated with the power generating flux .",
    "while this is a natural set - up in many problems , it may not always correspond to the relevant scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the efficiency of a chemical entropy - driven process of capital importance in biophysics , namely , copolymer synthesis @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "as exemplified by the copolymer dna , guardian of genetic information , such processes are essential for biological information processing .",
    "we will show that the above - mentioned complications are present in this generic model .",
    "in particular , the thermodynamic nonlinearity associated with the information processing aspect is responsible for a branching of the systems properties such as power , speed of growth , efficiency and entropy production , as one varies the affinity .",
    "furthermore , the regime of maximum power is located either outside of the linear regime or on the separate bifurcated branch .",
    "finally , it turns out that the thermodynamic force is not a natural control variable in the present model . while our ( exact ) analysis is carried out for the simplest possible model , namely , copolymer synthesis with two constituent building blocks , our findings suggest that chemical information processing usually operates in the far - from - equilibrium regime , with unique features due to the entropic contribution .    in sec .",
    "[ thermodynamics ] we present the basic thermodynamic formulas that define our system . in sec .",
    "[ kinetics ] we present the detailed kinetic description of our model , whose results are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ effmax ] .",
    "in particular , it is here that we exhibit the correct and unexpected results for the efficiency at maximum power , results that arise entirely from the nonlinear nature of the problem .",
    "a brief recapitulation is presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we begin with some well - known relations for isothermal systems . consider a spontaneous chemical process involving particles of different types labeled by @xmath3 , with corresponding particle number @xmath4 and chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "the system is in thermal and mechanical equilibrium at temperature @xmath6 and pressure @xmath7 .",
    "the total gibbs free energy @xmath8 evolves toward a minimum value , so that @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , to characterize the evolution of the isothermal system we write @xmath10 we have separated the total entropy change into two contributions .",
    "the first one , @xmath11 , is the always - positive part of the entropy change , called the internal entropy production .",
    "the other is the contribution to the entropy change due to exchange processes between the system and its environment , and can be positive or negative .",
    "associated with these contributions , we have written the change in he number of particles of type @xmath3 as @xmath12 where the first contribution is due to exchange of particles with the environment , and the second is the internal change caused by the chemical reaction .",
    "we take the system to be closed , i.e. , it exchanges only energy but not particles with the environment , so that @xmath13 .",
    "these definitions lead to consistency between the statements that the system evolves toward a minimum in the gibbs free energy and that the internal entropy production of this chemical system has to be positive  @xcite , that is , @xmath14 obviously , for a reversible transformation with zero internal entropy production @xmath15 .",
    "we now turn to the simplest scenario of copolymer synthesis .",
    "the system consists of a bulk - phase containing two types of monomer units , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which can attach or detach at the endpoint of a single linear copolymer .",
    "we identify the four states @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 represent free bulk monomers and @xmath23 represent monomers attached to the copolymer .",
    "since the number of each type of monomer is conserved , one has @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the entropy production ( [ ep ] ) can thus be written in the familiar bilinear form @xmath26 with the affinities @xmath27 and the conjugate fluxes @xmath28 .    in view of the relation @xmath29 , we rewrite the entropy production as @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the change of enthalpy per monomer upon transfer from the bulk to the copolymer . the crucial point , which has been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite , is to realize that the average change of entropy upon transfer of a monomer from the bulk to the copolymer contains two contributions .",
    "one is the monomer entropy , @xmath32 , due to the change in the monomer degrees of freedom and in the monomer internal structure between the free monomer in solution and the monomer inside the copolymer .",
    "the other is the configurational entropy denoted by @xmath33 , due to the change in the information stored in the polymer sequence that occurrs when a monomer is added to the copolymer .",
    "it is given by the shannon entropy @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the copolymer length in monomer units and @xmath36 is the probability of a copolymer with monomer sequence @xmath37 . in the absence of correlations ,",
    "the shannon entropy is expressed solely in terms of the monomer abundance probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 for simplicity , we further assume that monomer entropy and enthalpy changes upon transfer of a monomer from the bulk to the copolymer and vice versa have the same value for both monomers , that is , @xmath41 we henceforth call @xmath42 the monomer `` free enthalpy . ''",
    "introducing the net speed of growth of the copolymer , @xmath43 , the entropy production can finally be written as @xmath44 where the total affinity is given by @xmath45 the expression  ( [ entropyprodmodel ] ) for the entropy production in the steady state regime of the growing copolymer has been derived in refs .",
    "it is interesting to realize that the affinity is not an obvious control parameter due to its dependence on @xmath33 which is in turn a nontrivial function of @xmath46 .",
    "only @xmath46 can be easily controlled externally by changing the concentration of the monomers in solution .",
    "the power at which @xmath46 , the free enthalpy divided by temperature , is extracted from the surroundings by copolymer growth is given by @xmath47 the efficiency @xmath48 of the process is defined as the ratio of this power over the cost @xmath49 of the entropy growth per unit time , @xmath50    in the reversible limit with @xmath51 , the efficiency of the process becomes optimal , @xmath52 , but the extracted power goes to zero .",
    "the standard prediction from linear thermodynamics that arrives at an efficiency of @xmath2 at maximum power is obtained upon expanding the velocity in terms of the affinity , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the linear response coefficient . within this approximation",
    "the power becomes @xmath55 .",
    "note that this power attains its maximum for @xmath56 with the corresponding efficiency @xmath57 , if we assume that @xmath33 is kept constant .",
    "however , below we will investigate the more natural optimization with respect of @xmath46 , since this is the natural and easily controllable variable related to the free enthalpy flux .",
    "whatever control variable is used , we will see in sec .",
    "[ effmax ] that the true maximum is beyond the reach of this linear expansion ( and even of a nonlinear continuation of this expansion ) .",
    "we now turn to the detailed kinetic description of the copolymerization process , which will allow us to identify the expressions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the context of a full nonlinear analysis .",
    "let us call @xmath60 and @xmath61 the rates of insertion and removal , respectively , of monomer @xmath62 . because the free enthalpy of the monomers has been assumed to be the same , the ratios of the reaction rates are given by @xmath63 the fraction @xmath59 of monomers of type @xmath64 present in the copolymer in the regime of steady growth can be determined by the following self - consistency argument .",
    "the ratio @xmath65 of the number of @xmath64 versus @xmath66 monomers in an ensemble of copolymers has to be equal to the ratio of their net rates of attachment . for monomer @xmath64",
    ", this net rate is the pure rate of attachment , @xmath67 , minus the rate of detachment , which is @xmath68 .",
    "the factor @xmath59 arises from the fact that detachment is only possible when the monomer at the tip of the copolymer is of type @xmath64 , and this occurs with probability @xmath59 .",
    "the net rate of attachment for @xmath66 is similarly given by @xmath69 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath70 the solution of the resulting quadratic equation for @xmath59 reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 . by a similar argument",
    "we find that the speed of growth of the copolymer , given by the rate of attachment @xmath73 minus the rate of detachment @xmath74 , is given by @xmath75    we note from eqs .",

    ", one of them can be set equal to @xmath16 by an appropriate choice of the time unit , e.g. , @xmath89 . as the remaining two degrees of freedom ,",

    "we next turn to a discussion of these figures , supplemented with corresponding analytic calculations .",
    "the information contained in fig.[plot1 ] is detailed in the caption .",
    "the most striking feature in this figure is the existence of two different branches for the power and velocity in terms of the affinity .",
    "the transition between the two branches occurs when @xmath95 diverges .",
    "@xmath96 indicates @xmath88 or @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath97 is an analytic function of @xmath46 , the new branch appears when @xmath98 touches zero .",
    "as long as the latter quantity remains positive , which is the case for @xmath90 smaller than a certain critical value , cf . fig .",
    "[ plot3 ] , the power and velocity can be seen as a true function of @xmath93 .",
    "branching takes place at the critical point , characterized by @xmath99 , resulting in @xmath100 and @xmath101 , see again fig .",
    "[ plot3 ] . for values of @xmath90",
    "larger than this critical value , power is no longer a proper function of @xmath93 , as two branches appear , with two values of @xmath96 for a given value of @xmath93 .",
    "while along the linear branch and its continuation the affinity decreases with @xmath46 , the affinity _ increases _ with @xmath46 on the new lower branch , cf .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ plot3 ] .",
    "this remarkable result implies that we can approach low values of affinities via a nonlinear branch which is distinct from the branch predicted by linear response theory and its continuation .",
    "we note that the entropy production itself becomes a bi - valued function in terms of the affinity , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ plot4 ] .",
    "naively , one would expect that entropy production and affinity both provide consistent measures for the distance from equilibrium .",
    "this is clearly not the case in the present model , where the entropy production is a decreasing function of the affinity on the upper nonlinear branch . in particular , for very large values of @xmath90 one finds that the entropy production becomes very large while the affinity goes to zero .",
    "we conclude that the affinity is not a reliable measure for the distance from equilibrium .",
    "to explore the region close to equilibrium and , in particular , the linear response regime , we write @xmath102 and expand in powers of @xmath103 . from eq .",
    "( [ disorder ] ) with eqs .",

    "the lower left regions of the power and speed plots in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] .",
    "note also that the onsager coefficient becomes independent of @xmath90 in the limit @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "we have seen that linear response predicts an efficiency at maximum power of @xmath2 . however , as announced earlier , this result is not correct .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] or in fig .",
    "[ plot2 ] , where the affinity is clearly above the value @xmath0 in the regime ",
    "closest \" to equilibrium .",
    "the explanation is that maximum power occurs beyond the reach of linear response theory , as can clearly be seen in the lower inset of the @xmath58 plot in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] , where the linear response curves ( dashed lines ) become inaccurate at maximum power .",
    "furthermore , we note that the point of maximum power moves onto the nonlinear branch as @xmath90 grows , now occurring at decreasing values of @xmath93 .",
    "so , even though we are approaching a regime of low power output with decreasing affinity , we do so via the nonlinear branch , where the prediction of linear response theory utterly fails .",
    "the main conclusion is that , while there is indeed a regime of linear response , it is unable to describe the region of maximum power , which always occurs outside the regime of validity of the linear law .    to complete our analysis",

    "the numerical results of fig .",

    "we therefore expand the velocity around @xmath125 and find @xmath126 . using eq .",
    "( [ powergen ] ) , we find that maximum power occurs at @xmath127 , resulting in @xmath128 .",
    "for @xmath129 the latter becomes @xmath130 as observed in figs .",
    "[ plot1 ] and [ plot2 ] .",
    "similarly , by expanding @xmath48 to first order around @xmath125 and using the value we found for @xmath46 at maximum power , we find that @xmath131 as observed in figs .",
