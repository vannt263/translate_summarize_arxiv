    "many quantum physical systems are modelled approximately as closed systems .",
    "however , in most practical cases the interaction of a given system with its environment can not be neglected and this makes it necessary to use the theory of open quantum systems  @xcite . in the past , it has been very common to neglect quantum memory effects and to resort to a markovian approximation . in many applications the time evolution of the open system is described by a quantum dynamical semigroup represented by a generator of the lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan form  @xcite",
    ".    however , when the environment has a nontrivial structure , one has to account for memory effects influencing the dynamics of the open system . during recent years",
    ", there has been significant conceptual , theoretical , and experimental progress dealing with non - markovian processes  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the very definition of non - markovianity and quantification of quantum memory effects in the dynamics of open systems has received a lot of interest . several measures for quantum non - markovianity",
    "have been proposed which are based on different mathematical and physical concepts  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the non - markovianity measure proposed in @xcite which expresses the degree of memory effects in terms of the amount of information exchanged between the open system and its environment . within this approach",
    "the degree of non - markovianity is connected to certain optimal initial pairs of quantum states , leading to a maximal flow of information from the environment to the open system . here",
    ", we will study the mathematical and physical properties of such optimal state pairs .    throughout",
    "this paper @xmath0 refers to the hilbert space of the open quantum system and the corresponding set of physical states , i.e.  the set of positive trace class operators @xmath1 with unit trace is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the open quantum system can be represented in terms of a one - parameter family @xmath3 of completely positive and trace preserving ( cpt ) linear maps @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is equal to the identity map @xcite .",
    "we will use the quantity @xmath6 as a measure for the degree of memory effects in the open system dynamics @xcite . here , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the trace distance @xcite defined by @xmath9 by definition , the non - markovianity measure @xmath10 is a positive functional of the process @xmath11 .",
    "it is zero if and only if the trace distance between any pair of initial states is a monotonically decreasing function of time @xmath12 signifying a continuous loss of information from the open system to its environment .",
    "a nonzero value for the measure means that there is an initial state pair for which the trace distance increases over a certain time interval which can be interpreted as a flow of information from the environment back to the open system implying the presence of memory effects .",
    "the time integral in determines the total backflow of information for a certain pair of initial states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is then found by taking the maximum over all initial state pairs , i.e. @xmath10 represents the maximal possible backflow of information .",
    "a pair of states @xmath15 is said to be an _",
    "optimal state pair _ if the maximum in eq .",
    "is attained for this pair . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the mathematical and physical features of the maximization procedure involved in expression .",
    "in particular , we will obtain general statements about the physical properties of optimal state pairs which give rise to the maximal possible degree of memory effects in their dynamics . to this end , we first show in sec .",

    "we then proceed in sec .",
    "[ orthogonality ] to demonstrate that the states of any optimal pair must be orthogonal .",
    "this is our central result which is physically very plausible since it implies that an optimal pair must have the largest possible initial trace distance @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the maximal flow of information from the environment back to the open system emerges if the initial state pair is distinguishable with certainty , i.e.  has a maximal information content .",
    "we discuss specific features of the case of infinite - dimensional state spaces in sec .",

    "[ sec : counterex1 ] we study the question of whether this statement holds true for higher dimensional systems .",
    "the answer is negative .",
    "in fact , we will construct in this section an example for the dynamics of a three - level system ( @xmath17-system ) for which the optimal pair is not a pure state pair .",

    "the state space @xmath2 of an open quantum system is given by the set of positive trace class operators on its hilbert space @xmath0 with trace one @xcite , @xmath18 on the basis of the convex structure of the state space one can define the boundary @xmath19 of @xmath2 as follows .",
    "a point @xmath20 is defined to be an interior point if and only if for all @xmath21 there is a real number @xmath22 such that @xmath23 denoting the set of all interior points by @xmath24 , one defines the boundary of the state space by @xmath25 thus , @xmath26 if and only if there exists @xmath21 such that for all @xmath22 the operator @xmath27 does not belong to the state space @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to show that a density matrix @xmath20 belongs to the boundary @xmath19 of the state space if it has a zero eigenvalue .",
    "in fact , let @xmath28 be a normalized eigenvector of @xmath1 with eigenvalue zero , and @xmath29 the corresponding projection operator .",
    "then , for all @xmath22 the operator @xmath30 has the negative eigenvalue @xmath31 with corresponding eigenvector @xmath28 , and thus does not belong to the state space .    for finite - dimensional systems the boundary",
    "@xmath19 actually contains only states with zero eigenvalues .",
    "this can be seen by setting @xmath32 with @xmath33 in which yields the operator @xmath34 .",
    "if all eigenvalues of @xmath1 are strictly positive , it follows from the continuity of the roots of the characteristic polynomial that for sufficiently small @xmath35 also all eigenvalues of @xmath36 are positive .",
    "this shows that states with strictly positive eigenvalues are in the interior @xmath37 such that @xmath38 for finite - dimensional systems .",
    "as has been mentioned already in the introduction a pair of states @xmath39 is said to be an optimal state pair if the maximum in eq .",
    "is attained for this pair , i.e. , if @xmath40 holds for this pair .",
    "if we speak of an optimal pair we will always assume that the quantum process under consideration is non - markovian , i.e. @xmath41 , since otherwise any pair of quantum states would be trivially optimal .",
    "moreover , we note that the optimality property implies of course that @xmath42 .    [",
    "the : boundary ] let @xmath43 be an optimal state pair . then both states lie on the boundary of the states space , @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that ( at least ) one state of the pair , say @xmath14 , does not belong to the boundary .",
    "hence , @xmath14 is an interior point and there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath45 is a quantum state ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the three states is given by @xmath46 , @xmath47 . by the linearity of the dynamical map we have @xmath48 and , hence , @xmath49 it follows that @xmath50 note that @xmath51 is a fixed number strictly larger than @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the last equation tells us that the trace distance between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is always larger by the constant factor @xmath51 than the trace distance between @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the quantity @xmath56 is larger than @xmath57 by the same factor @xmath51 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath39 can not be an optimal pair which is a contradiction .",
    "consequently , any optimal pair of states must belong to the boundary of the state space .",
    "thus we see that the maximization over all initial state pairs in the definition of the non - markovianity measure @xmath10 can be restricted to the boundary @xmath19 of the state space , @xmath58 we emphasize that this result is valid for any hilbert space @xmath0 and for any family of linear dynamical maps @xmath4 .",
    "the linearity guarantees the invariance of the decomposition defined in for all times @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate that optimal state pairs must be orthogonal which strengthens the result of sec .  [ sec : boundary ] .",
    "we recall that two quantum states @xmath13 and @xmath14 are said to be orthogonal , @xmath59 , if and only if their supports are orthogonal , @xmath60 , where the support is defined as the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "note that the orthogonality of two states implies that both states have a zero eigenvalue and , hence , that both states belong to the boundary of the state space .",
    "we also mention that the trace distance between any two quantum states satisfies @xmath61 , where the equality sign holds if and only if @xmath59 . orthogonality is thus equivalent to unit trace distance @xcite .",
    "[ the : orthogonality ] optimal state pairs are orthogonal .",
    "let @xmath43 be an optimal pair of states , and suppose that the states are not orthogonal , @xmath62 . according to the jordan - hahn decomposition @xcite there exist positive and orthogonal operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that @xmath65 taking the trace of this equation we see that @xmath66 .",
    "from @xmath42 we conclude that @xmath67 . using eq .  , the orthogonality of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the fact that the trace distance between nonorthogonal states is always strictly smaller than @xmath52 , we find @xmath68 thus , we have @xmath69 .",
    "now we define the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "being positive and of unit trace , these operators represent quantum states .",
    "moreover we have @xmath72 by use of the linearity of the dynamical maps we obtain @xmath73 from which it follows that @xmath74 since @xmath75 we can conclude from the last equation that the pair @xmath76 yields a non - markovianity which is strictly larger than that of the pair @xmath39 , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath39 is an optimal pair .",
    "hence , @xmath13 and @xmath14 must be orthogonal .",
    "it follows from theorem [ the : orthogonality ] that the maximization in the definition of the measure @xmath10 for quantum non - markovianity can be restricted to orthogonal initial state pairs .",
    "again , this result holds for any hilbert space @xmath0 and any family of linear dynamical maps @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that for infinite dimensional spaces an optimal state pair need not necessarily exist . to be mathematically more precise ,",
    "the maximum in the definition for the non - markovianity measure should be replaced by the supremum to account for such cases .    in theorems [ the : boundary ] and [ the : orthogonality ]",
    "we have assumed that an optimal pair of states does exist .",
    "if there is no such pair there is a sequence of state pairs @xmath77 such that @xmath78 converges to @xmath10 for @xmath79 . employing the construction used in the proof of theorem [ the : orthogonality ]",
    "one can show that the pairs @xmath77 can always be taken to be orthogonal .",
    "this means that the non - markovianity measure can be approximated with arbitrary precision by orthogonal state pairs and that we can write @xmath80      in this section we present an alternative proof for the orthogonality of optimal state pairs , where we restrict ourselves to finite dimensional hilbert spaces , @xmath81 .",
    "this proof could be of interest also in other contexts since it relies on the behavior of pairs of states under parallel translations .",
    "the idea of the proof is based on the observation gained from two - level systems that nonorthogonal states on the boundary of the state space can be simultaneously translated by a traceless hermitian operator to yield a pair of mixed states , while the trace distance of the pair is invariant under such translations . to make this idea more precise we define @xmath82 to be the set of nonzero , hermitian and traceless operators on @xmath0 .",
    "[ def1:trans ] two states @xmath43 are called jointly translatable if and only if there exists an @xmath83 such that @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "hence , two states are said to be jointly translatable if and only if there is a nontrivial hermitian and traceless operator @xmath86 which can be subtracted from the states without leaving the state space .",
    "we prove that any pair of nonorthogonal states is jointly translatable in such a way that both translated states do not belong to the boundary of the state space .",
    "[ the : trans ] if @xmath43 and @xmath62 then @xmath39 are jointly translatable .",

    "relabeling one can assume that @xmath94 and @xmath95 holds .",
    "moreover , by an appropriate choice of the phases of the eigenstates one can assume without restriction that @xmath96 is real and positive , i.e.  @xmath97 .",
    "we consider the following superpositions of the two overlapping eigenvectors , @xmath98 where the normalization constants obey @xmath99 .",

    "consider now the quadratic function @xmath117 one can show that this function is strictly positive for @xmath85 if @xmath35 satisfies @xmath118 thus , if we choose any @xmath35 satisfying we obtain @xmath119 for all normalized vectors @xmath109 and @xmath85 which leads to @xmath120 .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath121 is positive and has no zero eigenvalue , i.e. @xmath122 due to the characterization of the boundary in terms of the eigenvalues given in sec .",

    "we remark that the converse of the statement of theorem [ the : trans ] holds , too .",

    "since @xmath125 it follows that also the states @xmath93 are not optimal , which represents a contradiction .",

    "in this paper we have shown that optimal pairs of initial states for non - markovian quantum dynamics must be orthogonal which implies that these states can be distinguished with probability @xmath52 by a single measurement .",
    "optimal state pairs thus have the maximal possible amount of initial information and are therefore capable of emitting and reabsorbing the maximal amount of information during the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "we emphasize that the proof of these statements only relies on the convexity of the state space and on the linearity of the dynamical maps .",
    "our results are thus very general and can be applied to any quantum process describable by a family of linear dynamical maps @xmath4 in any hilbert space . strictly speaking",
    ", even the complete positivity of the dynamics is not needed .",
    "in fact , it suffices to assume that the maps @xmath4 are positive since even trace - preserving positive maps are contractions for the trace distance @xcite .",
    "we have further demonstrated that for hilbert spaces with dimensions of at least @xmath144 optimal state pairs need not consist of pure states , in contrast to the case of a qubit where optimal pairs are always antipodal points on the bloch sphere , and as such pure .",
    "the example constructed here leads to an optimal pair consisting of a pure and a mixed quantum state .",
    "we conjecture that in hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath145 and higher one can also construct quantum processes for which both states of the optimal pair are true mixtures .",
    "finally , we mention that on the basis of the present results further , more specific statements could be proven if one assumes additional properties of the quantum process , such as invariance under certain symmetry groups , or the existence of invariant states .",
    "in addition , the notion of joint translatability provides new insights into the structure of the state space and might serve for further applications .",
