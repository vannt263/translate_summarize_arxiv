    "the standard approach to description of spatial solitons in nonlinear optical waveguides is based on the use of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which replaces the maxwell s equations ( me ) in the paraxial approximation @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "as is known , this approximation can be insufficient for the description of very narrow , _ subwavelength _",
    "( subwavelength ) solitons , with a size @xmath0 @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the carrier wavelength in vacuum @xcite .",
    "terms which are neglected when deriving the nls equation from me couple to the propagation constant , affecting dynamics of very narrow solitons with arbitrary polarization @xcite .",
    "particular cases of the tm ( transverse - magnetic)- and te ( transverse  electric ) polarized subwavelength solitons in media with purely cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity were considered in detail in refs .",
    "it was found that , in the tm case , the size of both bright and dark solitons can not be essentially smaller than @xmath3 . in the te case ,",
    "the size of the dark soliton is also limited from below , while the bright soliton may formally be arbitrarily narrow ; however , narrow te solitons are subject to a strong instability .",
    "the analysis performed in those works was formal in the sense that subwavelength soliton solutions in the model with the kerr nonlinearity imply unrealistically large values of the nonlinear correction @xmath4 to the refractive index , @xmath5 . as is known @xcite ,",
    "the quadratic ( in the amplitude of the electromagnetic field ) correction @xmath4 , which defines the kerr nonlinearity , is , as a matter of fact , only the first term of the expansion in powers of the squared field .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that results of the formal consideration , based on dropping the higher - order corrections and using the ensuing truncated model in the range where the quadratic correction @xmath6is allowed to be large , are _ ambiguous _ : they strongly depend on a particular stage of the analysis at which the higher - order terms are omitted .",
    "this ambiguity is especially conspicuous in the case of the tm narrow solitons : depending on the choice of the truncation stage , one arrives at a conclusion that the width of the bright tm soliton remains limited from below , or may become arbitrarily small .",
    "in fact , the physical problem of the existence of subwavelength solitons is unresolvable within the framework of the kerr model , and the only possibility to obtain a definite result is to adopt a more realistic nonlinearity , with _",
    "saturation _ of @xmath4 in some form for strong fields .",
    "while an exact form of the saturation in real materials is not usually known , there are two commonly used models , viz . , the saturable nonlinearity proper @xcite , and the cubic - quintic ( cq ) @xcite one .",
    "the former nonlinearity is realistic for alkali metal vapors @xcite , and the latter nonlinearity , which combines self - focusing cubic and self-_defocusing _ quintic terms ,  is well documented to describe nonlinear optical properties of the pts crystal @xcite .",
    "moreover , formation of ( 2 + 1)d solitons in this material , consistent with the predictions of the cq model , was recently observed in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "we also note that the ( 2 + 1)d and ( 3 + 1)d versions of the cq model have recently attracted considerable attention as they give rise to stable or almost stable multidimensional ( spatial or spatiotemporal ) solitons @xcite .",
    "our objective is to consider subwavelength spatial solitons of both tm and te types _ parallel _ in the cq and saturable models , in order to arrive at general conclusions concerning their width and other fundamental properties .",
    "moreover , both ( 1 + 1)- and ( 2 + 1)-dimensional [ ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d ] cases will be considered , in the latter case the spatial soliton being a cylindrical beam . we will conclude that , in both models and for both dimensions , there always exists a finite minimum value of the soliton s width , and fundamental properties of the subwavelength solitons are fairly similar in these two models . on the basis of these results ,",
    "one may infer that , in fact , qualitative results obtained in this work ( first of all , the existence of the minimum width ) apply to narrow spatial solitons in _ any _ non - kerr model .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we derive , directly from me , general equations that describe narrow spatial tm solitons in both ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d geometries . in section 3",
    ", we consider a much simpler te case .",
    "in fact , for this case soliton solutions are well known ( in particular , they can be found in an exact form in the ( 1 + 1)d geometry ) .",
    "this allows us to rigorously prove that the relative soliton s width , divided by the carrier wavelength , can not be smaller than a certain minimum value . in section 4 , combining analytical considerations and direct numerical solutions , we find ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d fundamental tm solitons and arrive at the conclusion that their width is also limited from below .",
    "we start the analysis with the most nontrivial case of the tm polarization . in this case , irrespective of the particular nonlinearity , the _ real _ ( physical ) vectorial electric @xmath7 and magnetic @xmath8 fields can be taken as @xmath9 @xmath10 in the ( 1 + 1)d case , and in the ( 2 + 1)d case , @xmath11 @xmath12 note a phase shift @xmath13 between the transverse and longitudinal components in these expressions . here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transverse and propagation coordinates , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is time , and the common phase of all the fields is @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 being , respectively , the propagation constant and frequency of the carrier wave . in the ( 2 + 1)d case ,",
    "the expressions ( [ 2 + 1h ] ) and ( [ 1 + 1e ] ) correspond to the standard tm@xmath21mode in a cylindrical waveguide @xcite .",
    "the simplest saturable model assumes an isotropic material characterized by the relation @xmath22 \\label{sat}\\ ] ] between the electric induction and strength , with positive nonlinear permeabilities @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "expansion and truncation of eq .",
    "( [ sat ] ) yields the cq model in the form @xmath25    a difference between the two models appears in the case when the truncation leading from @xmath26 to @xmath27 is no longer valid .",
    "below , we present analysis in a detailed form for the cq model . for the saturable one",
    ", it is quite similar , but formulas are more cumbersome .",
    "final results will be displayed for both models together .",
    "following the usual rotating - wave approximation , the next step is to substitute eqs .",

    "although the minimum width of a family of solitons generated by this equation was not specially considered , a straightforward consequence of results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite is that the minimum width is always finite .",
    "thus , it is possible to rigorously prove the existence of a finite lower bound for the width of spatial te solitons in the ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d models with the cq nonlinearity .",
    "quite similarly , the same results can be obtained for te solitons in the model with the saturable nonlinearity ( we do not display technical details here , as they do not contain anything essentially novel ) .",
    "the most interesting case is that with the tm polarization , as it does not reduce to a single - component equation . as it was mentioned above , the necessary condition for the existence of localized solutions to the corresponding equations ( [ equ ] ) and ( [ equations ] ) , supplemented by eqs . ( [ p ] ) through ( [ c ] ) , is @xmath82 .",
    "below , we will use a _ relative propagation constant _ , @xmath83 , as a measure of the departure from the paraxial approximation : in the limit of a very broad soliton , one has @xmath84 , while in the opposite limit of an infinitely narrow soliton ( if any ) , @xmath85 .    a straightforward analysis of eqs .

    "fundamental solitons feature a different structure : they have @xmath88 , and both @xmath92 and @xmath93 may have zeros at finite @xmath79 , see fig . 1b .    proceeding to the width of the tm soliton",
    ", we use the electromagnetic energy density , @xmath94 to define the soliton s average half - width as @xmath95 the fwhm definition of @xmath96 , which was used in the previous section for the te soliton , is ambiguous for tm solitons , as they have three different components . the results for the average width , which were obtained from numerical solutions of eqs .",

    "2 , showing @xmath96 vs. the relative propagation constant at different values of the material constant @xmath97 defined by eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "basic features of the dependence are the same as those following from the above analytical expressions for the te soliton in the ( 1 + 1)d case : there is a _ finite minimum _ of the soliton s width , and the solitons do not exist beyond a critical value of @xmath98 , at which the soliton s width diverges while its amplitude remains finite , cf .",
    "( [ upperlimit ] ) .",
    "naturally , the minimum value of the width depends on the dimension of space , type of the nonlinearity , and , for a fixed nonlinearity , on values of material constants . as well as in the case of the te solitons",
    ", the minimum width tends to zero and the maximum value of @xmath98 diverges as @xmath99 .",
    "note that the soliton shapes shown in fig .",
    "1 pertain to the fixed value of the relative propagation constant @xmath100 , which is rather close to the paraxial limit .",
    "comparison with other numerical results demonstrates that , for both cq and saturable models , the shapes of the ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d tm solitons remain fairly similar to those shown in fig .",
    "1 with the increase of @xmath98 up to the point where the minimum width is attained . with the subsequent increase of @xmath98 up to the value",
    "at which the solitons cease to exist , the shape changes much more .",
    "the above considerations did not tackle the stability problem .",
    "while a consistent stability analysis requires very tedious simulations of the maxwell s equations with the cq or saturable nonlinearity , which is beyond the scope of this work , we tried to test the stability by means of the simple vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion @xcite ( although its applicability to the present model is not obvious ) : the propagation constant must have a positive slope as a function of the beam s power ( norm of the solution ) , @xmath101 ( cf .",
    "( [ waverage ] ) ) , which is a dynamical invariant of the model .",
    "our numerical calculations have shown that all the tm solitons , in both the ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d geometries , satisfy the vk criterion .",
    "in this work , we have studied very narrow ( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d spatial te  and tm solitons supported by the quintic - cubic and saturable nonlinearities , starting the full maxwell s equations . for te solitons , we have obtained a single equation , which is equivalent to the stationary version of the nonlinear schrdinger equation with the corresponding nonlinearity , while for tm solitons we end up with a system of equations for the transverse and longitudinal components of the electric field , rather than with a single one .",
    "it is also noteworthy that te solitons in the ( 2 + 1)d case are described by the same equation as vortex solitons with spin @xmath80 in the ( 2 + 1)d nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "detailed analysis was displayed for the cubic - quintic model , while final results were given for the saturable model as well .",
    "full qualitative similarity of the results obtained for both models ( although exact scales may be quite different , see caption to fig .",
    "2 ) makes it very plausible that the situation is basically the same for _ any _ physically relevant non - kerr medium .",
    "the most important conclusions are that , in all the cases , there is a finite minimum of the soliton s width , and the solitons cease to exist at a critical value of the propagation constant , at which their width diverges .",
