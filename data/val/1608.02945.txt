    "the kepler space telescope is now the most successful planet - finding mission to date .",
    "most of its thousands of planets ( and planet candidates ) have been found around cool stars @xcite , while exoplanets orbiting a stars remain elusive .",
    "after the announcement of an additional 1284 _ kepler _ exoplanets in 2016 may @xcite , still fewer than 20 a stars have confirmed planets .",
    "radial velocity observations of cool sub - giants , most notably via the ` retired a stars ' project @xcite , suggest that planet occurrence rates reach a maximum for stars of @xmath3m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this coincides remarkably with the masses of main - sequence a stars in the classical instability strip , where delta scuti ( @xmath5sct ) pulsators are common .",
    "the apparent planet deficit around these main - sequence stars can be explained as an observational selection effect , caused by problems in the application of the most successful planet - hunting methods to these types of stars .",
    "the transit method has difficulty because of the pulsational luminosity variations , which amount to several mmag , and because planets occupy wider orbits around a stars ( @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , resulting in a lower transit probability . the radial velocity method , on the other hand",
    ", is particularly hindered by the nature of a - type spectra .",
    "a stars are typically fast rotators , with the mean of the equatorial rotational velocity distribution exceeding 100kms@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "their high effective temperatures lead to fewer , shallower absorption lines , and these lines can be distorted by pulsation .",
    "therefore the wavelengths of their spectral lines are not a precise standard of measure , and the state of the art is limited to 12kms@xmath6 precision @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the same pulsations that limit rv and transit surveys of a stars can themselves be used as precise clocks for the detection of orbital motion @xcite .",
    "the pulsations of @xmath5sct stars are particularly well suited to this task @xcite .",
    "no planets have yet been discovered orbiting main - sequence a stars via the motion of their host stars , namely , via the rv , astrometric , or pulsation - timing methods .",
    "discoveries have been made using two other methods : transits and direct imaging .",
    "the former category includes _ kepler _ planet hosts ( kepler-13 , 462 , 516 , 959 , 1115 , 1171 and 1517 ; @xcite ) , plus wasp-33 @xcite , hat - p-57 @xcite and kelt-17 @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods of these systems are all under 30d , except for kepler-462b whose period is 85d .",
    "these planets are strongly irradiated and would have high surface temperatures .",
    "the imaged planets in the nasa exoplanet archive have very wide orbits .",
    "these include three objects ( hd100546b , hip78530b and @xmath7andb ) with masses above the canonical 13-m@xmath0 boundary between planets and low - mass brown dwarfs , which orbit b - type stars .",
    "exoplanets orbiting a stars include fomalhautb @xcite , @xmath8picb @xcite , hd95086b @xcite , the multi - planet system hr8799b , c , d , e @xcite , and the planet in the triple system hd131399ab @xcite , all of which have orbits ranging from 9 to 177 au .    finally , there are some planets orbiting evolved hot stars , such as those discovered from eclipse timing variations of the white - dwarf binary nnser @xcite , the companion to the sdb star v0391peg from pulsation timing variations @xcite , and companions to other sdb stars kic10001893 @xcite and the now - doubtful case of kic5807616 ( @xcite , cf .",

    "the minimum mass of the sub - stellar companion to kic7917485 ( 11.8m@xmath0 ) is close to the planet  brown - dwarf mass boundary .",
    "although such a body would not be expected to have a solid surface , it could presumably host smaller exomoons .",
    "it is therefore interesting to determine whether the planet lies within the habitable zone .",
    "the habitable zone is broader for a stars than for cooler stars because the inner edge extends to higher incident surface fluxes for hotter stars @xcite .",
    "their calculations indicate that , at the temperature of kic7917485 , the inner edge lies between @xmath461.2 and 1.4 times the surface flux at earth , depending on the mass of the potentially habitable body .",
    "the mean projected separation between the components , @xmath47 , is 2.05au . at this separation ,",
    "the luminous a star irradiates the companion to a surface flux ratio , @xmath48 , of 2.36 times the flux at earth . statistical correction for random inclination gives @xmath49 as the most probable value .",
    "the luminosity of the a star is not well constrained , and is a strong function of main - sequence age . at the @xmath50 lower luminosity limit ( see table[tab : atmos ] ) , those values of @xmath48 reduce to 1.72 and 1.27 , respectively .",
    "thus the position of kic7917485b is consistent with the habitable zone at the @xmath50 level .",
    "the companion would have been closer to the center of the habitable zone earlier in the star s lifetime .",
    "the luminosity will be refined substantially when the _ gaia _ mission provides a distance measurement , and the question of habitability can be reassessed .",
    "kic7917485b is the least massive companion that we have found in _",
    "data with the pm method ( et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have also found two other stars with time delay variations consistent with planetary companions having periods longer than the 4-yr data set ( kic9700322 , kic8453431 ) , but the finite duration of _ kepler _ time - series does not allow the orbits to be fully parametrized .",
    "these detections allow us to comment on the planet occurrence around a stars .",
    "the detectability of low - mass companions is very sensitive to the noise in the fourier transform of the time delays , which is determined by the pulsation properties @xcite .",
    "we quantified this noise level for 2040 pulsating single a stars and found that only five of them had lower noise levels than kic7917485 . against the same sample , kic9700322 and kic8453431 ranked as the 9@xmath51 lowest and 2@xmath52 lowest , respectively .",
    "in other words , we have been able to detect a planetary - mass companion in one of the nine stars with the lowest noise levels , and two others show variations that are consistent with planetary - mass companions .",
    "this fact is in strong support of existing observations that intermediate - mass stars ( ` retired a stars ' ) tend to host high - mass planets in wide orbits @xcite .",
    "we have found a planetary companion of near the inner edge of the habitable zone of kic7917485 .",
    "this is the first planet orbiting a main - sequence a star to be discovered via the motion of its host star .",
    "other planets orbiting a stars have been discovered via the transit method and have short periods , or been discovered by direct imaging and have very long periods .",
    "our finding is particularly significant because no other method is presently capable of detecting non - transiting planets around these stars with periods of a few years , i.e. , near their habitable zones .",
    "kic7917485 has particularly low noise levels in its light arrival time delays .",
    "we analyzed other stars with similarly low noise and for two of them we also found evidence for planetary - mass companions with periods similar to the 4-yr time span of _ kepler _ data .",
    "this fact strongly supports the idea that intermediate - mass stars tend to host high - mass planets in wide orbits ."
