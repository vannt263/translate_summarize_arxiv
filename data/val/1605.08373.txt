    "animal tissue cells sense the mechanical and geometrical features of their environment by applying traction forces to the extracellular matrix .",
    "various studies over the last decades demonstrated the importance of tissue mechanics for cell behavior , including cell adhesion , migration , proliferation , differentiation and fate @xcite .",
    "it has been shown early that cells respond sensitively to the rigidity of their environment , with larger spreading area and higher force generation on stiffer substrates @xcite . even more dramatically , essential cell processes such as cell differentiation are controlled by substrate stiffness @xcite . because environmental stiffness is a passive property of the environment , cells have to actively pull on it to determine its magnitude @xcite .",
    "cellular traction forces are not only used to sense extracellular stiffness , but also to sense geometrical properties of the environment @xcite .",
    "this is most evident for adhesive patterns , whose geometry also determines cell responses such as cell survival and differentiation @xcite .",
    "however , geometry sensing also includes cell sensitivity to topographical features of the environment , which spans several orders of magnitude , ranging from the molecular up to the cellular scale @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that cell differentiation can be controled also by nano - topography @xcite .",
    "regarding the cytoskeletal response , it has been found that cells tend to align with grooves on substrates with corresponding nano- and micro - topography @xcite .",
    "another physiological relevant example is topography - driven polarity guidance and directional growth of neurons @xcite .",
    "early examples for topography sensing on the _ @xmath0 _ scale are studies that showed the alignment of actin microfilaments in cells adhered to microcylinders @xcite .",
    "interestingly it was found that cells tend to align either parallel or orthogonal to the direction of highest curvature dependent on the cell type .",
    "inspired by these observations mechanical cell models have been proposed that suggest the importance of mechanical stress in the cytoskeleton for the detection and the response to curved structures @xcite .",
    "recently the combined effect of stiffness and geometry has been studied by engineering topographic features into polyacrylamide substrates , which as hydrogels however tend to swell in medium and therefore change dimensions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that cells align with the topographic features independent of stiffness .",
    "however , no attempt has been made to measure cellular traction forces in these experiments . in general",
    ", there are many physiological situations in which cells are exposed to mechanical and geometrical cues simultaneously , and therefore will use cellular traction forces to sense them both at the same time .",
    "an interesting example are podocytes , which are epithelial cells lining the basement membrane of the glomerular capillaries in kidneys , which have a wavy shape @xcite .",
    "however , a setup that allows to quantitatively measure forces for such situations is still missing , despite recent progress in measuring cellular traction forces on planar substrates .    during the last three decades , the measurement of cellular forces ( traction force microscopy , tfm ) has become a mature research field @xcite .",
    "the standard setup uses a planar elastic substrate whose deformations are tracked using embedded marker beads .",
    "standard choices for substrate material are polyacrylamide ( paa ) or crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) . for sufficiently thick substrates ,",
    "one then can use the green s function of an elastic halfspace to relate these deformations to traction forces ( gf - tfm ) @xcite . for a thin substrate , the corresponding green s function",
    "is also known @xcite .",
    "tfm - procedures can be made quite fast by inverting the elastic equations in fourier space ( fourier transform traction cytometry , fttc ) , which is a special case of gf - tfm @xcite .",
    "traditionally , cell forces had been reconstructed only in the x - y - plane of a planar substrate ( with the z - direction denoting the normal direction ) , but over the last years , the green s function approach has been extended to also reconstruct the z - forces that cells exert to the substrate @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use the finite element method ( fem ) to reconstruct these z - forces ( fem - tfm ) @xcite . within a fem - approach",
    ", one does not rely on the analytical form of a green s function , but uses numerical solutions to the mechanical problem interpolated on a suitable chosen grid @xcite .",
    "another alternative to gf - tfm is the direct method , in which deformations are directly converted into a stress tensor , from which the traction forces are extracted @xcite .",
    "if one aims at implementing tfm for non - planar substrates , from these three methods ( gf - tfm , fem - tfm and direct tfm ) only the second one seems feasible .",
    "first it is notoriously hard to analytically calculate green s functions for non - planar ( e.g. wavy ) surfaces , thus ruling out gf - tfm .",
    "as we will see below , wavy substrates lead to rather noisy displacement data , which is hard to deal with in direct tfm , because it relies on constructing derivatives of the measured data .",
    "therefore we opted for an approach using fem - tfm , which needs more computer time than traditional gf - tfm , but offers the same level of robustness .",
    "we first developed a novel experimental technique to prepare curved micromolded pdms substrates with embedded fluorescent marker beads matching the requirements of tfm application .",
    "in contrast to the paa - hydrogels often used for studies of mechanosensing , the micromolded pdms - substrates used here do not suffer from swelling and therefore present time - independent geometrical cues to the cells .",
    "however , because the point spread function in such a substrate varies in space , special procedures have to be used for tracking the marker beads .",
    "because here we focus on measuring traction forces , we did not vary the mechanical stiffness of the substrates . on the computational side we established a complete workflow to reconstruct cellular traction fields on such non - planar substrates .",
    "the core of this technique is a parallelized optimization framework that efficiently implements fem to reconstruct cellular traction forces in 3d .",
    "we validated our procedures by reconstructing simulated traction patterns under various experimental conditions .",
    "in particular , we show that the use of the l1-norm for the definition of the residue strongly improves our force reconstruction because it better deals with outliers than the l2-norm .",
    "we then applied tfm to cardiac myofibroblasts cultured on curved elastic substrates , thus complementing a traditional contact guidance experiment with measurements of cell traction forces . by comparing both polarization of the cytoskeleton and the distribution of cellular traction",
    "we show that cells not only adjust their morphology , but also their moments of traction force to geometrical properties of their surrounding .",
    "elastomeric substrates were made of sylgard @xmath1 silicone elastomer kit ( dow corning gmbh , wiesbaden , germany ) as described previously @xcite . in brief , both components ( base and cross - linker ) of the elastomer kit were mixed at various ratios to generate after cross - linking either stamps from vinyl disc masters ( 10:1 ) or cell culture substrates of stiffness 15 kpa ( 50:1 ) . for stamp manufacturing round polypropylene rings ( diameter 10 mm ) were placed on top of the vinyl disc and crosslinked at @xmath2c for 4 h. stamps were peeled off and silanized with tricholorosilane . for force analysis cell culture substrates",

    "layer thickness was adjusted to 80 @xmath0 using glass slices of same defined thickness ( menzel gmbh , braunschweig , germany ) as spacers .",
    "cross - linking of silicone oil was performed at @xmath3c for 16 h. after curing stamps were carefully peeled off and structured elastomeric substrates were glued to the bottom of 3.5 cm petri - dishes to cover predrilled holes @xcite .",
    "mechanical properties of all elastomeric mixing ratios were characterized as described resulting in elasticities as given above and a poisson s ratio of @xmath4 .",
    "cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from @xmath5-day - old wistar rat embryos as described previously @xcite .",
    "primary cardiac fibroblasts were cultured for additional @xmath6 days at @xmath7c and @xmath8 co@xmath9 in a humidified incubator on standard polystyrene cell culture dishes to induce their differentiation to myofibroblasts , which have more prominent focal adhesions and stress fibers .",
    "cells were trypsinized and subsequently transfected using nucleofector technology ( lonza - amaxa systems , cologne , germany ) .",
    "@xmath10 cells were resuspended in @xmath11 liposome solution containing @xmath12 purified plasmid - dna ( gfp - vasp or gfp - vinculin ) .",
    "after transfection , resuspended myofibroblasts were seeded on fibronectin coated ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) ( bd bioscience , new jersey , usa ) silicone rubber wave substrates at a density of @xmath15x@xmath16 per sample for traction force microscopy .",
    "the cells were seeded for at least 24 hours before the measurements were taken .",
    "live cell analyses were performed at @xmath7c and @xmath8 co@xmath9 using an inverse confocal laser scanning microscope ( lsm 710 , zeiss , germany , software zen 2011 ) equipped with live cell imaging accessories and a @xmath17x planapochromat oil immersion objective ( ph3 , na @xmath18 , zeiss ) .",
    "confocal 3d micrographs were taken using appropriate laser and filter settings for detection of green and red fluorescent light .",
    "z - stacks of approximately @xmath19 with optimized overlap were taken .",
    "as reference value , z - stacks without cells ( peeled off with glass micro needle ) were performed with the same parameters .",
    "acquisition of a single slice took 8 seconds and we typically acquired 100 slices with a distance around 0.4 @xmath0 .",
    "thus acquisition time for one stack was around 15 minutes .",
    "bead tracking for wavy substrates is challenging because of the long stack acquisition time leading to considerable drift not only between the deformed and the reference states , but even within one stack .",
    "we figured that this drift did not result from cell activity , because 24 hours after spreading , they were quiescent",
    ". moreover the observed drift was similar at any depth in the substrate .",
    "as another special feature of wavy substrates , we observed that in contrast to planar substrates , the point spread function varied in space .",
    "our bead tracking routine consists of three steps : determination of image drift , single bead localization , and feature vector based tracking of bead movement . to reduce noise ,",
    "the stacks were first binomially filtered with a @xmath20x@xmath20x@xmath20 filter kernel , voxel sizes @xmath21 m or @xmath22 m lateral and @xmath23 m or @xmath24 m vertical",
    ". then spots ( usually @xmath25 ) in the undeformed corners of the image were marked ( in the x - y - plane ) . at these spots a cuboid ( voi , volume of interest ) with @xmath26 of the image size in each dimension was cropped from the first image and cross - correlated with the second image to obtain the drift . because the drift in each slice of the stack can differ , this voi is cropped along each slice and so the drift is calculated for every slice separately .",
    "the area in which the voi is cross - correlated with the second stack has to be larger than the maximum shift of the two image stacks . to decrease the calculation time for the cross correlation ( cc ) , the size of the image stack and the vois",
    "are initially reduced by two levels of gaussian pyramid .",
    "the positions of the maximum cc values are then used to calculate the drift on the full image to get the exact drift .",
    "this can be done in a very small search area ( @xmath6x@xmath6x@xmath6 pixel ) around the previously calculated positions . to obtain a subpixel accurate positioning of the vois , parabolas were fitted through three points ( maximum of cc and both neighbors ) in x , y , and z - directions , respectively .",
    "the extreme values of the fits are defined as the subpixel accurate voi positions .",
    "the cc and parabola fitting is also done in the first image stack to get a subpixel accurate position there as well .",
    "the mean difference between the voi positions in the first and in the second stack defines the drift , separately for each slice .    to localize beads in each image stack ,",
    "both stacks were first filtered with a @xmath27x@xmath27 and a @xmath28x@xmath28 binomial filter .",
    "these filtered images were then subtracted , to get a bandpass - filtered stack , with negative gray values set to zero .",
    "then a voi that represents one bead in three dimensions is selected manually and fitted to a 3d gaussian .",
    "the fit is used as a reference template to find other beads that match the template .",
    "the fitted gaussian is cross - correlated with the first and the second stack .",
    "then the cross - correlated dataset is segmented with a threshold ( @xmath29 ) and each segment is labeled . at the maximum cc value in each labeled segment",
    "the data is again fitted to a gaussian and the center of mass of that fit is defined as bead position .",
    "once the beads are localized in both stacks , they have to be correlated to each other . here , we adapted a feature vector based tracking method as published previously @xcite .",
    "before we apply the tracking procedure , the determined drift is subtracted from the bead positions found in the second stack .",
    "then the distance of a bead ( b1 ) from stack 1 to all other beads in its neighborhood ( @xmath30x@xmath30 pixel in x - y- and @xmath31 pixel in z- direction ) is calculated . to the at most @xmath27 beads with the lowest distance , vectors from b1 to those beads",
    "are created .",
    "these vectors are added to beads ( b2 ) in stack 2 ( again only in a neighborhood of @xmath30x@xmath30x@xmath31 pixel around the position of b1 ) and a cubic surrounding ( e.g. @xmath27x@xmath27x@xmath27 pixel ) is created at each end of the vector .",
    "if there is a bead located within this surrounding , a hit is counted .",
    "the more hits are counted , the bigger is the probability that bead b1 corresponds to b2 .",
    "the bead b2 with the most hits ( at least @xmath20 out of @xmath27 ) is assigned to bead b1 . if two or more beads b2 have the same amount of hits , the one with the lowest deviation at the vector ends is chosen .",
    "as pre - processing step for the traction reconstruction we need to determine the substrate shapes .",
    "although the substrate preparation described above leads to reproducible samples with @xmath32 m accuracy , shape variations and material relaxation after mold removal occasionally change the final shape .",
    "the latter effect can in principle be predicted theoretically @xcite , however , in practice local shape variations occur and make the use of theoretical shape predictions difficult . for that reason we determine the substrate shape for each individual tfm data set by image processing of the relaxed configuration of the marker beads , which are distributed sufficiently homogeneously in the substrate as to carve out the substrate shape .    -shape algorithm is applied to projected bead positions in order to determine the envelope .",

    "it has no essential influence on the regularization scheme .",

    "we also emphasize the need for adaptations in the image processing procedures on wavy substrates .",
    "because the point spread function for the marker beads can vary locally in this case , we can not use the standard cross correlation approach for bead tracking , but resort to a template matching procedure based on feature vectors @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the anisotropy in the point spread function by using a reduced weight for the z - component in the residue . together with the use of the l1-norm for the residue",

    "we note that even round cells tend to align with the substrates features , presumabely because the feature dimensions are such that every cell is affected by the topographical cues .",
    "in addition to this observation we determined traction force maps for an exemplary set of cells and demonstrated the successful reconstruction of the 3d forces .",
    "we found that cells also balance their forces along the orientation of the pattern , even if at the same time forming a bridge between neighboring hills . because our reconstruction is strongly regularized due to the noise issues with wavy substrates , the absolute values of the measured traction stresses are expected to be lower than the actual values , as shown earlier with model - based traction force microscopy @xcite .",
