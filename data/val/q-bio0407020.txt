    "@xcite using a generic population dynamics model .",
    "the basic model introduced in  @xcite incorporates birth , death , competition for resources , and infection .",
    "the model reads :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 stands for the total number of mice , @xmath2 for the total number of infected mice , @xmath3 is the birth rate coefficient , @xmath4 the death rate coefficient , @xmath5 the infection rate coefficient , and @xmath6 the carrying capacity that characterizes the resources available to the mice and the resulting competition .",

    ". note that eq .",
    "( [ meanfielda ] ) depends only on the latter three , whose effect on the total population can thus be studied separately from the issue of infection .",
    "infected pregnant mice produce hanta antibodies that keep their foetus free from the infection .",
    "consequently , there is no birth term in eq .",
    "( [ meanfieldb ] ) . also , there is no recovery term in the model because mice become chronically infected with the virus .",
    "the analysis of the internal fluctuations in the mouse population due to the discrete and finite sizes of the populations requires the generalization of the mean field model to a stochastic description , e.g. , a master equation . in this paper",
    "we start with such a master equation , but at the very outset we outline some reasonable approximations that lead to a mathematically tractable model .",
    "a full master equation description of the problem would involve @xmath15 , the probability distribution function for there to be @xmath16 total mice and @xmath17 infected mice at time @xmath18 .",
    "we find this full master equation to be analytically intractable .",
    "we therefore break the problem up into two parts as follows .",
    "first , we formulate a master equation for the reduced probability distribution function @xmath19 associated only with the mean field equation  ( [ meanfielda ] ) .",
    "this master equation ( which is not influenced by the infection ) is tractable , as we shall see .",
    "we then argue that the fluctuations in the _ infected _ mouse population arise from two sources .",
    "one is the dependence on @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ meanfieldb ] ) and the fact that this total population fluctuates . having solved the master equation associated with @xmath1 , we are able to incorporate these fluctuations into the stochastic description of infected mice",
    ". we will show that the effects of these fluctuations may be profound , especially when the mean mouse population is not too large , and may lead to unexpected consequences .",
    "these are the new features that we are particularly interested in exploring .",
    "the other arises from the additional inherent fluctuations in the number of infected mice due to the fact that this population is also finite and discrete .",
    "these are especially important when the number of infected mice is small , but we do not include them explicitly in our equations , again because of tractability problems .",
    "this is not as serious as one might think because we do know their consequences , which can also be profound ( as we have shown in  @xcite ) : these fluctuations may cause a small population of infected mice to disappear entirely .",
    "in other words , if one is in a regime where the population of infected mice is small in the absence of these fluctuations , consideration of these fluctuations might eliminate this population entirely .",
    "thus , results obtained without consideration of these fluctuations can be thought of as an upper bound on the number of infected mice . at worst one would be overestimating the presence of infected mice in the regime where the number of infected mice is in any case small or zero .    in sec .",
    "[ modeltotal ] we present the stochastic model for the total mouse population . section  [ modelinfected ] deals with the stochastic model for the infected mouse population , and in sec .",

    "\\label{masterequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is not tractable as it stands , but it is amenable to a system size expansion as introduced by van kampen  @xcite . a system size expansion is appropriate when the system is `` large '' or , as in our case , the species under consideration numerous .",
    "it is important to note that this implies that the steady state solution for @xmath1 given in eqs .",
    "( [ meanfieldsol1 ] ) and ( [ meanfieldsol2 ] ) , which we expect the mean of the stochastic solution to reproduce , must therefore be `` large '' , that is , @xmath6 must be proportional to the system size .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the size of the system , must be essentially independent of the system size for this analysis to be appropriate . to implement a system size expansion",

    "( [ masterequation ] ) as @xmath26 .",
    "the implemention of a system size expansion requires several steps .",
    "first , although @xmath16 is a discrete variable , we can represent the discrete changes in @xmath16 via an infinite series of derivatives in which @xmath16 is treated as a continuous variable : @xmath27 this exact relation allows us to rewrite the master equation  ( [ masterequation ] ) as @xmath28 np(n , t ) + \\frac{d}{\\omega } \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac { 1}{j!}\\frac{\\partial^j}{\\partial n^j } n(n-1)p(n , t).\\ ] ] next , one makes the heuristic assumption that one can perform the change of variables @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean value of the mouse population density and @xmath31 represents the fluctuations around the mean .",
    "we then define the probability distribution @xmath32 applying the standard chain rule @xmath33 together with the relation which follows from the change of variables relation , @xmath34 we can ( after multiplying through by @xmath35 ) rewrite the master equation in terms of the new distribution , @xmath36 \\left(\\omega\\phi + \\omega^{1/2}z\\right)\\rho(z , t ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{d}{\\omega } \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty   \\omega^{-j/2}\\frac{1}{j!}\\frac{\\partial^j}{\\partial z^j}\\left(\\omega\\phi+\\omega^{1/2}z\\right ) \\left(\\omega\\phi+\\omega^{1/2}z-1\\right ) \\rho(z , t ) .",
    "\\label{stillexact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is still exact .    in the large system size limit",
    "there are three divergent terms in eq .",
    "( [ stillexact ] ) proportional to @xmath37 that must cancel , that is , we must require that @xmath38 note that this exactly corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ meanfielda ] ) , that is , @xmath30 is indeed the mean population density . in the steady state",
    "we thus have @xmath39 using this result in the surviving terms in eq .",
    "( [ stillexact ] ) in the large @xmath25 limit then leads , in the steady state , to the equation @xmath40 this is the steady state limit of a fokker - planck equation for the probability density of the stochastic variable @xmath31 .",
    "its solution with natural boundary conditions at @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 a gaussian distribution centered at zero and of width proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "this in turn implies that the total number @xmath16 of mice also has a gaussian distribution whose mean is the mean number of mice predicted by the deterministic model and whose width is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "the internal fluctuations thus do not alter the behavior of the total number of mice in any dramatic way .",
    "they simply lead to a gaussian distribution around the deterministic mean whose width increases with increasing birth rate and increasing carrying capacity .",
    "however , as we will see in the following sections , the consequences of this distribution on the number of infected mice can be unexpected .",
    "we now return to the infected mouse population , whose evolution is described in mean field by eq .",
    "( [ meanfieldb ] ) .",
    "while we are ignoring the internal fluctuations that arise from the fact that this population is finite and discrete ( as discussed earlier ) , we do wish to provide a stochastic description that incorporates the effects of the fluctuations in the total mouse population @xmath45 .",
    "our results of the previous section indicate that in the steady state we can think of @xmath45 as a stochastic variable , @xmath46 where the fluctuations @xmath47 have zero mean and are generated from the ornstein - uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation @xmath48 here @xmath49 is zero - centered @xmath50-correlated gaussian noise of unit intensity , @xmath51 . in the stationary state",

    "the intensity of these fluctuations is determined by the width of the total mouse population distribution .",
    "the correlation time @xmath57 is a measure of the time it takes a total population diminished by fluctuations to recover .    because @xmath55 is a `` colored noise '' with finite correlation time , the exact solution of the problem ( [ stochastic])-([basicinf ] ) is not known . in particular",

    "the most probable value for the infected population is still zero , but nonzero values now have a finite probability and the mean value of infected mice is positive .",
    "the lower right hand insets in both panels are sketches of this behavior , which persists as a function of increasing @xmath6 until the carrying capacity reaches a second critical value , @xmath71+\\sqrt{b(b - c)[b^2-c(4a+b)]}}. \\label{kc2}\\ ] ] when @xmath6 crosses the curve @xmath72 the divergence in the distribution ( [ probdistr ] ) disappears and the most probable number of infected mice moves to finite values .",
    "the curve has a divergent asymptote at @xmath73 , but its behavior as a function of @xmath5 otherwise depends on the other parameters . if @xmath74 then @xmath75 also diverges at @xmath76 .",
    "this is the situation in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ figshape ] . on the other hand , if @xmath77 then @xmath75 is complex when @xmath78 , thus producing the abrupt vertical boundary seen in panel ( b ) .",
    "this second case corresponds to the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the monte carlo simulations of aguirre _ et al .",

    "both the average number of infected mice and the most probable number of infected mice are now positive .",
    "note that we have labeled the rightmost value of @xmath5 on the dashed curve as @xmath79 , whether it is an asymptote as in panel ( a ) or the abrupt ending point of the curve as in panel ( b ) .",
    "there is an additional transition curve , more subtle than the other two , drawn as the dotted curves in both panels in fig .",

    "we denote this transition curve as @xmath80 . on the upper right hand in both panels",
    "is the sketch of the probability distribution in this region . here",
    "the probability distribution diverges at zero , but another maximum develops at a finite number of infected mice .",
    "this maximum is found as the finite positive root of the derivative condition @xmath81 .",
    "the dotted curves in the phase diagrams indicate the location of this transition .",
    "a number of points about these results deserve special highlighting .",
    "the particular behavior just described for large @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( divergence at the origin and also another maximum ) is entirely due to the fact that the internal fluctuations are _",
    "the correlation time of these fluctuations is @xmath82 , and the color has arisen naturally and not as an additional assumption .",
    "it is interesting to note that the monte carlo simulation results of aguirre _ et al . _",
    "@xcite exhibit a number of features that might be related to the results that we have derived here .",
    "one is that in their simulations the number of infected mice as a function of @xmath6 jumps discontinuously from zero to a finite number ( whereas the mean field value does not ) .",
    "they note that an explanation for this result lies in the fact that the number of mice is discrete and that one whole mouse is needed to obtain a result different from zero ( although their jump is much greater than unity ) . in our continuous language , the behavior they observe might reflect the abrupt transition between the @xmath50-function distribution ( or the one with a maximum at the origin ) to the one with a zero probability density of no infected mice as @xmath6 increases .",
    "their simulations use the value @xmath83 . to support this argument further ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] the ratio of the dispersion to the mean for these parameter values .",
    "the dispersion is of the order of the mean and , near the transition value @xmath70 , the ratio actually diverges .",
    "we have elsewhere pursued the argument that a possible criterion for the likely extinction of a species is precisely that the dispersion be of the same size as the mean  @xcite .",
    "the substantial width of the distribution might make itself apparent in a simulation through the high likelihood of absence of the infected species . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the ratio of the dispersion to the mean for a value of @xmath84 .",
    "the fluctuations are now decidedly smaller , even though we are in a regime of far fewer infected mice on average ( as indicated by the values of @xmath6 )",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the size of the jump in the infected mouse population at the transition would decrease in a monte carlo simulation with @xmath84 . finally , we comment on three last points .",
    "one concerns the validity of the system size expansion .",
    "the total mean number of mice in the population is @xmath85 , and",
    "the system size expansion is valid if this number is in some sense sufficiently large ( the expansion is valid if the neglected terms are small ) .",
    "while we have not explicitly checked the validity , in most of the regimes under discussion the number of infected mice is an order of magnitude greater than unity .",
    "our second point is to stress that the fluctuations that lead to the distributions of infected mice are entirely due to the discrete and finite character of the _ total _ number of mice . and",
    "yet , while the ratio of the width of the distribution of total mice to the mean number of total mice , @xmath86 , is small in most of the phase diagram ( @xmath87 ) , the width of the distribution induced in the number of infected mice is relatively large ( of @xmath88 ) in most of the diagram . the third point is a reminder that this theory has not included the fluctuations caused directly by the fact that the number of infected mice is discrete and finite .",
    "these fluctuations would further broaden the distributions .",
    "we have considered the effect of the internal fluctuations in the total mouse population on the number of infected mice .",
    "although these fluctuations cause no dramatic effects in the total mouse population , yielding a gaussian distribution of relatively small variance for a sufficiently large population , these fluctuations have a rather strong effect on the distribution of infected mice . because the fluctuations are not `` direct '' but instead appear indirectly through the coupling between infected and uninfected mice , the fluctuations necessarily and naturally appear as colored in the equations that describe the evolution of infected mice .",
    "this leads to a variety of effects beyond those that would be caused by simple white noise  @xcite .",
    "the mean infected population in this model is exactly that predicted in mean field .",
    "however , while the mean field model predicts one critical value of the carrying capacity parameter ( @xmath70 ) such that below this value there is no infection and above this value there is , the stochastic model leads to three critical values ( @xmath70 , @xmath75 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "the first , which occurs at the same critical value as that of the deterministic model , here corresponds to a transition between a state with no infected mice to an intermediate state in which the most probable state is still one with no infected mice but with a finite probability of infection .",
    "the second describes a transition between this intermediate state and the outbreak state , where the probability distribution that there is no infection goes to zero .",
    "the intermediate state ( @xmath89 ) displays different behaviors depending on the parameter values .",
    "in particular , in some parameter ranges the intermediate state has very few infected mice .",
    "we argued that the inclusion of the internal fluctuations in the infected mouse population ( which was not considered due to analytic difficulties ) would probably lead to extinction of this small number of infected mice .",
    "this then means that the effective transition between non - epidemic and epidemic states may occur at @xmath75 rather than at @xmath70 .",
    "we also identified another transition curve , @xmath80 , beyond which the probability diverges at zero but where another maximum develops at a finite number of infected mice .",
    "these features may be useful in the design of more effective prevention policies .",
    "for instance , an increase in the effective annihilation rate of the mice ( by either increasing the death rate or decreasing the birth rate or both ) might help because it increases the relative size of the region in parameter space in which the infected mouse population distribution has a divergence at the origin ( the state of no infected mice ) .",
    "the most effective strategy for the control of hantavirus outbreaks is the reduction of the carrying capacity @xmath6 so as to cross from one regime to another with a higher probability of no infected mice .    c. escudero is grateful to the department of chemistry and biochemistry of the university of california , san diego for its hospitality .",
