    "in 1994 , three research groups succeeded in forming crystals composed of small particles in a low temperature plasma , called `` plasma crystals '' @xcite .",
    "these systems ignited the interest of scientists world - wide , and the research on them has since increased dramatically . in general , charged microparticles embedded in a weakly ionized plasma",
    "are called `` complex plasmas '' in analogy to complex liquids  soft matter systems in the liquid form @xcite . the term `` complex plasma '' sets these systems apart from the naturally occurring dusty plasmas , even though this distinction is not always made .",
    "complex plasmas are of great interest as the microparticles can become the dominant species regarding energy and momentum transport @xcite , and they display a multitude of collective effects that occur in other systems as well .",
    "complex plasmas can often serve as model for these other systems .",
    "numerical simulations of complex plasmas are useful to check the theoretical understanding , to make estimates of plasma parameters that are not easily accessible in experiments , and to predict parameters for future investigations .",
    "three main approaches to simulations of complex plasmas exist , along with variations and hybrid models of these approches .",
    "firstly , the plasma is modeled as a fluid . if charging processes are investigated , applying a fixed potential at the surface of a stationary particle suffices @xcite . in order to simulate larger dynamic systems ,",
    "the microparticles are treated as an additional fluid in a simulation of the whole complex plasma @xcite . @xcite",
    "introduced tracer particles into such a model and were able to reproduce the vortices that often form in weightless complex plasmas .",
    "these fluid models suffer from the problem that the time scale of the microparticle dynamics is much larger than that of the plasma , and the simulation typically switches periodically between advancing the plasma fluid and advancing the microparticle fluid , until an equilibrium is reached @xcite .",
    "the microparticles and the plasma are coupled via the poisson equation and the forces acting on the microparticles .",
    "the second approach to numerical simulations of complex plasmas is to use particle - in - cell ( pic ) methods , often coupled with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , to study the movement of ions and electrons in the vicinity of microparticles @xcite .",
    "this approach is very effective in investigating ion drag effects , wakes and the charging process of microparticles @xcite .",
    "mc methods are also used to study ion transport in complex plasmas @xcite .",
    "the interaction between multiple microparticles is taken into account with a particle - particle - particle - mesh scheme .",
    "microparticles are usually treated as stationary @xcite .",
    "some authors have also performed a molecular dynamics simulation of the plasma flow around stationary microparticles @xcite .",
    "pic methods can also be used to study the whole discharge with stationary dust @xcite . if the pic is coupled to microparticle transport modules @xcite , dust distribution functions can be derived .",
    "the third approach to modeling complex plasmas is to use molecular - dynamics ( md)/langevin dynamics simulations of the microparticles .",
    "the plasma is usually taken into account analytically via the microparticle interaction potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a pic analysis can determine the interaction potential more accurately and then serve as input for the md simulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other plasma effects can be taken into account analytically as well , for instance a fluctuating particle charge @xcite .",
    "@xcite use an md simulation and include the effect of ion space charges by analytically including point charges in place of the ion space charges below the microparticles , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "hybrid approaches combine two or more of the techniques described above .",
    "for instance , @xcite use a p@xmath0 m model which combines pic and md approaches to study charging of microparticle strings . if nano- and microparticle growth is to be modeled , often , sectional models are used .",
    "these models can be coupled to fluid models of the plasma ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite use a hybrid approach in which they represent the plasma as a fluid and the microparticles as diffuse objects and study particle arrangement under the influence of the ion drag force . @xcite",
    "combine a 2d sheath fluid model and a 3d microparticle transport model to study the formation of plasma crystals .",
    "@xcite couple a fluid description of electrons to a kinetic description of dust .",
    "several authors in the group of m. kushner have developed a series of linked computer models to investigate the trapping of microparticles in radio - frequency ( rf ) discharges @xcite : a monte - carlo - fluid hybrid simulates the plasma , a pic simulation determines microparticle charging and ion - microparticle momentum transfer cross section , and a plasma chemistry monte carlo simulation provides ion flux .",
    "this is coupled to a microparticle transport module that calculates microparticle trajectories .",
    "the authors were able to identify several regions in which microparticle trapping occurred .",
    "in the later models feedback to the plasma was included to investigate particle transport and coulomb crystallization @xcite .",
    "the model we present here follows a similar concept as @xcite : we perform a hybrid fluid / analytical simulation of a radio - frequency plasma and couple this to a molecular dynamics simulation of the microparticles .",
    "in contrast to the work described above , which was mainly aimed at finding the trapping positions and studying plasma crystal formation , we reproduce dynamical collaborative effects in complex plasmas and compare with experimental results .    both the capacitely - coupled plasma ( ccp ) model and the md model are two - dimensional .",
    "the ccp model consists of a plasma sheath , which is solved analytically , and the plasma bulk , which is subject to the fluid simulation @xcite .",
    "the sheath width is fixed during the run of one simulation .",
    "this means that effects that depend on a changing sheath width , such as melting a plasma crystal by increasing the gas pressure @xcite , can not be modelled accurately without extending the model .",
    "also , we do not include the feedback from the microparticles to the plasma in this version of the model .",
    "this limits the applicability of the model to low microparticle densities where the havnes parameter @xmath1 @xcite is less than unity : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 designate the number densities of the microparticles and electrons and @xmath5 the number of electrons on the microparticles .",
    "our capacitively - coupled plasma ( ccp ) model is a modified version of the hybrid fluid - analytical simulation of inductive / capacitive discharges by @xcite , which itself is an extension of the plasma model by @xcite and the analytical sheath model by @xcite .",
    "we base our model on the geometry of the pk-3 plus chamber , which is a parallel - plate , capacitively coupled plasma chamber @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ] shows a sketch of the geometry .",
    "the electrodes are separated by and have a diameter of @xmath6 .",
    "we only model the right half of the experimental chamber , as it is approximately cylindrically symmetric .",
    "the electrodes are surrounded by a dielectric spacer and a grounded guard ring . in the physical experiment ,",
    "the spacer is very small , but in the simulation , we use a spacer of width .",
    "the reason for this choice is that we have to integrate over the spacer to obtain some output values , such as the radio - frequency voltage , and the error in the integration becomes large when small spacers are used .",
    "a wider spacer does not significantly modify the results in the plasma bulk .",
    "the bulk of the plasma is modeled as a quasi - neutral fluid .",
    "assuming quasi - neutrality significantly speeds up the simulation compared to the alternative , solving the poisson equation .",
    "the sheaths are solved analytically .",
    "we fix the nominal sheath width at and take into account the physically varying sheath width by varying the dielectric constant . all inductive coupling that is present in @xcite",
    "is removed from the model .",

    "even though we attempt to make the model as accurate as possible , taking into account various power deposition and energy loss mechanisms @xcite , we do not believe that this model is a quantitatively absolutely accurate description of the pk-3 plus chamber .",
    "for instance , the currents used in the model are generally higher than those determined experimentally .",

    "that our model is two - dimensional ( 2d ) , whereas experiments with complex plasmas under microgravity are always three - dimensional ( 3d ) .",

    "the microparticles are charged very quickly compared to the time they need to fall from the dispenser to the lower electrode . once charged , they are subject to the electric confinement and ion drag forces .",
    "close to the sides of the chamber , the confinement force dominates and pushes the microparticles into the chamber , where they form a cloud . near the center",
    ", the ion drag force dominates over the confinement force and pushes the microparticles towards the edges of the plasma .",
    "this leads to the formation of the particle - free central void .    at some distance from the chamber center , the confinement , interparticle and ion drag forces balance , and the particle cloud forms",
    "this mechanism has been modeled before , see for instance @xcite .    in order to mimic the injection process in the simulation , we place a small number of particles with no initial velocity near the upper right edge of the plasma bulk , close to the sheath .",

    "this is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : injection ] as a change in the color of the microparticles .",
    "once the particles approach the chamber center , the void clearly indents the particle droplet , and the microparticles start flowing around the void edge to the top and bottom .",

    "we note that the particles move more slowly in the simulation than in experiments - for similar settings , the particles spread around the void within a few seconds in experiments . in the simulation",
    ", the particles have just reached the edge of the void after .",
    "the reason for this is probably that in experiments , the particles are accelerated more strongly during the injection process : they transverse the sheath region on their way to the chamber center , where the electric field is much stronger than in the presheath region . in the simulation",
    ", we treat the sheath analytically , and thus do not allow particles to enter the sheath .",

    "experiments , e.g. on lane formation @xcite , have shown that particles generally move within the plane in which they were injected , even before they start to interact with particles that are already inside the chamber , so we do not expect a large deviation from the behavior we observe here .",

    "[ fig : injection ] .",
    "a difference between the simulation and the experiment is that the particles move significantly more slowly to the center of the cloud , and the crossover to phase separation occurs much faster .",
    "this is probably due to the lower injection speed ( see paragraph on confinement and void formation ) and to the fact that the cloud of bigger particles is partly crystallized in the simulation . also , there are vortices present in the simulation , which suppress the lanes formed further away from the axis of symmetry .",
    "another difference is that the lane formation in the beginning is less pronounced in the simulation , with fewer lanes of the larger particles , probably for the same reasons as the lower speed .",
    "the two - dimensional nature of our simulation also means that the microparticles do not interact with any out - of - plane particles , as they do in experiments .",

    "this is equivalent to the experimental situation , where the projectile decelerated inside the microparticle cloud from to @xcite .",
    "the reason for the deceleration is the interaction with the background particles  the projectile has to move them out of the way to be able to move .    as in the experiment",
    ", the projectile excites a mach cone in the background cloud .",
    "this is visible in the colors of the microparticles ( see fig .  [",

    "the angle of the mach cone increases in the simulation as in the experiment while the projectile moves through the cloud .",
    "this is due to the fact that the projectile is decelerating while moving on its trajectory inside the cloud .",
    "the projectile moves upwards and finally penetrates the cloud above the void , where it is again decelerated by the smaller microparticles . in the experiment",
    ", the projectile reaches the region above the chamber center and is consequently accelerated into the upper cloud , but its trajectory forms a steeper angle inside the void than in the simulation .",
    "the similarities between the simulation and the experiment break down when the projectile reaches the midplane of the chamber : in the simulation , we have applied reflecting boundary conditions at the vertical midplane of the chamber . in the experiment , the projectile moves into the right half of the chamber , in our simulation , it is reflected by the boundary and starts moving backwards / to the left .",
    "this means that it moves in opposite direction to the driving force , which then in turn decelerates it and turns it around again . in the experiment",
