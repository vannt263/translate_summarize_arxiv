    "the periodic orbits of an autonomous hamiltonian system , as well as their stability play a crucial role for the dynamical behavior of the system . orbits that are located near stable periodic orbits are ordered , while , near unstable periodic orbits chaotic motion occurs .",
    "therefore , by locating the main periodic orbits of a system and following their stability properties as one of its parameters changes , we obtain valuable information on the ordered or chaotic nature of motion in the system .    the orbital study of barred potentials has provided useful information on the structure of galactic bars ( c.f . * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in 2dimensional ( 2d",
    ") models , the galactic bar is supported by regular orbits trapped around the so called ` x1 ' periodic orbits , which are elongated along the bar major axis @xcite .",
    "based on the fact that these orbits do not extend beyond the corotation resonance , @xcite predicted that bars should end at , or before , corotation . in 3d models ,",
    "the planar x1 family has in general large unstable parts and , thus , its orbits are not sufficient in building the bar .",
    "however , other families of periodic orbits that bifurcate from x1 have large stable parts and support the bar .",
    "these families build the so ",
    "called ` x1tree ' ( skokos , patsis & athanassoula 2002a , b ) .",
    "specific families of the x1tree are associated with certain morphological features observed in real galaxies ( patsis , skokos & athanassoula 2002 , 2003a ) .",
    "although the basic morphological features of barred galaxies are related to the presence of orbits of the x1tree , orbits not belonging to this tree can also influence the galaxy s morphology .",
    "recently , it has been shown ( patsis , skokos & athanassoula 2003b ) that inner rings in barred galaxies are associated with specific families of periodic orbits influenced by the 4:1 , 6:1 and 8:1 resonances , which are located just beyond the end of the bar ( for a definition of the resonances see e.g. @xcite section 3.1.1 ) .",
    "the basic families belonging to the x1tree are usually located very easily , but , as we approach corotation , tracing periodic orbits that are influenced by high order resonances becomes a difficult and challenging problem .",
    "the difficulty in finding such orbits is mainly due to the fact that at this region there exist many periodic orbits close to each other , most of which are unstable .",
    "thus , one is looking for small or even tiny islands of stability in a region of the phase space of the system , which is mainly characterized by chaotic behavior .",
    "usually once a periodic orbit is located , the whole family in which it belongs can be found as a parameter of the system ( e.g. , the jacobi integral ) changes . in this way",
    ", we can follow the morphological evolution and the stability transitions of a family and determine its physical importance for the system .",
    "the problem of finding the initial conditions of periodic orbits for a given parameter set of a hamiltonian system is the starting point of the present paper .",
    "using an appropriate scheme we transform the aforementioned problem into a minimization problem , where the minimizers of a particular function defined on the poincar surface of section ( pss ) of the system correspond to the periodic orbits of the hamiltonian .",
    "then , by applying an efficient optimization method , particle swarm optimization ( pso ) , and using deflection techniques , we locate periodic orbits , and follow them as a parameter of the system varies .",
    "this procedure is applied successfully on a 3d galactic potential of a ferrers bar .",

    "the 3d barred galaxy model that we use is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a miyamoto disk , a plummer bulge and a ferrers bar .",
    "the potential of the miyamoto disk @xcite is given by the formula ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 represents the total mass of the disk , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are scale lengths such that the ratio @xmath4 gives a measure of the flatness of the model , and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the bulge is a plummer sphere , i.e. , its potential is given by , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bulge scale length and @xmath8 is its total mass . finally , the bar is a triaxial ferrers bar with density , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 in eq .",

    "the length unit is taken as 1  kpc , the time unit as 1  myr and the mass unit as @xmath26 .",
    "the bar rotates with a pattern speed , @xmath27=0.054 , around the @xmath28-axis , which corresponds to 54  km  sec@xmath29  kpc@xmath29 , and places corotation at 6.13  kpc .",
    "the hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle can be written in the form , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the canonical momenta .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath34 will be vaguely reported as the ` energy ' , @xmath35 , of the system .",
    "_ swarm intelligence _ methods are stochastic optimization , machine learning and classification procedures that model intelligent behavior ( bonabeau , dorigo & theraulaz 1999 ; kennedy & eberhart 2001 ) .",
    "they are closely related to the methods of _ evolutionary computation _ , which consists of algorithms motivated from biological genetics and natural selection .",
    "a common characteristic of all these algorithms is the exploitation of a population of search points that probe the search space simultaneously @xcite .",
    "particle swarm optimization ( pso ) belongs to the category of swarm intelligence methods .",
    "the development of pso sprang from the simulation of social dynamics of flocking organisms , such as insect swarms , which are governed by fundamental rules like nearest  neighbor velocity matching . in nature , information is communicated among the members of bird flocks and fish schools , enhancing their ability to search for food and enabling them to move synchronized without colliding @xcite . the social behavior of animals , and in some cases of humans ,",
    "is governed by similar rules .",
    "there is a general belief , and numerous examples coming from nature enforce it , that social sharing of information among the individuals of a population , provide an evolutionary advantage .",
    "the dynamics of population in pso resembles the collective behavior and self  organization of socially intelligent organisms .",
    "the individuals of the population exchange information and benefit from their discoveries , as well as the discoveries of other companions , while exploring promising areas of the search space . in our case ,",
    "the poincar section is our search space , and periodic orbits of a hamiltonian system are computed through the minimization of a function . in the context of function minimization , promising areas of the search space are characterized by low function values .      a suitable way to study the stability of orbits in the 6d phase space of the hamiltonian system ( [ eq : ham ] ) is the well  known method of the poincar surface of section ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead of following the time evolution of an orbit in the whole phase space ,",
    "we confine our study on an appropriately chosen subspace of it . in our case , the pss is the subspace @xmath36 of @xmath37 , defined by the conditions , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the major axis of the bar lies along the @xmath40 axis .",
    "thus , for a given value of the energy @xmath35 , an orbit with initial conditions , @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 denotes the transpose of a matrix ) , on the pss is fully defined as @xmath38 and @xmath43 can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) keeping only the positive found value of @xmath43 .    in this way ,",
    "only the 4 initial conditions of an orbit on the pss are necessary for identifying the orbit .",
    "then , the time evolution of the orbit is derived by solving the hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "the next intersection of the orbit with the pss , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , is denoted as , @xmath44 which is obviously a point belonging to the 4dimensional pss of the system . by using the notation @xmath45 , the initial conditions , @xmath46 , of a @xmath47periodic orbit of the system satisfy the equations : @xmath48 thus",
    ", finding the initial conditions , @xmath46 , of a @xmath47periodic orbit is equivalent to solving eq.([eq : eq ] ) , which in turn is equivalent to computing the global minimizers of the function @xcite , @xmath49 this function is called the objective function , and it is actually the square of the euclidean distance on the pss between the initial point of an orbit and its @xmath47th intersection with the pss . obviously , if the studied orbit is @xmath47periodic this distance is zero .",
    "thus , the aforementioned technique transforms the problem of finding periodic orbits into the problem of computing the global minimizers of the function  @xmath50 .",
    "let us now describe the procedure of finding a minimizer of the objective function @xmath50 defined on a 4dimensional search space , @xmath51 , which is a subspace of the pss .",
    "as already mentioned , pso is a population based method , i.e. , it exploits a population of individuals to probe for promising regions of the search space , simultaneously .",
    "the population is called a _ swarm _ and",
    "the individuals ( i.e. , the search points ) are called _",
    "particles_. in our case the swarm is a set of initial conditions on the pss and a particle is a point @xmath52 on the pss , which corresponds to an initial condition of an orbit of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) . in every iteration of the pso method",
    ", we check whether any of the particles is a minimizer of the objective function , @xmath50 , of eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) .",
    "if it is , the minimizer is recorded , otherwise , each particle is moved to a new position in the search space @xmath53 using an adaptable displacement called _ velocity _ , retaining also a memory of the best position it ever encountered . in our case",
    "the best positions possess lower function values .    the particles of the swarm exchange information among them .",
    "there are two variants of the method with respect to the number of particles that share information : the _ global _ and the _ local _ variant @xcite . in the global variant of pso , the best position ever attained by all particles of the swarm is communicated among them . in the local variant , each particle",
    "is assigned to a neighborhood consisting of a prespecified number of particles and the best position ever attained by the particles that comprise the neighborhood is communicated among them . in the latter case , the information attained by the particles is spread in the swarm slowly , maintaining high diversity of the particles for more iterations of the algorithm than in the global variant , which converges faster to the best position .",
    "consequently , the local variant has better exploration abilities while the global variant has better convergence rates ( exploitation ) . in the present paper",
    "we use the local variant of pso as it is more appropriate for the location of periodic orbits in the chaotic region near the corotation of the bar potential . in this region",
    "there are many periodic orbits , very close to each other , most of which are unstable .",
    "thus , in order to locate such orbits , we need an algorithm that performs thorough exploration of the phase space with the cost of slightly slower convergence .",
    "let us consider a swarm consisting of @xmath54 particles .",
    "each particle is in effect a 4dimensional vector , @xmath55 the velocities of the particles are also 4dimensional vectors , @xmath56 the best previous position encountered by the @xmath57th particle is a point in @xmath53 , denoted by @xmath58    the positions , @xmath59 , and the velocities , @xmath60 , of the particles are randomly initialized , following a uniform distribution within the search space . the best positions , @xmath61 , are initially set equal to @xmath59 . each particle is evaluated according to the objective function @xmath50 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) , i.e. , the value @xmath62 is computed for all particles . obviously , at the initialization phase it holds that @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 , be a neighborhood of radius @xmath65 of the @xmath57th particle , @xmath59 ( local variant ) .",
    "then , @xmath66 is defined as the index of the best particle in the neighborhood of @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath67 the neighborhood s topology is usually cyclic , i.e. , the first particle @xmath68 is assumed to follow after the last particle , @xmath69 . in the general case we face in the present paper ,",
    "the search space is 4dimensional . in this case",
    "we use a swarm consisting of @xmath70 particles , while the neighborhood of every particle has radius , @xmath71 .",
    "for example , the neighborhood of the particle @xmath72 consists of the particles , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath68 , @xmath72 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the specific neighborhood size was selected in order to benefit from the exploitation ability of the local pso variant , while avoiding very slow convergence rates implied by smaller neighborhoods .",
    "if there exist a particle @xmath78 , such that @xmath79 , then the initial conditions of a @xmath47periodic orbit are found . in the opposite case , we proceed to the next iteration of the algorithm , which is to move the particles to new positions , taking into account their history so far .",
    "this is done according to the equations @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 ; @xmath82 is a parameter called _ constriction factor _ ; @xmath83 and @xmath84 are two fixed , positive parameters called _ cognitive _ and _ social _ parameter respectively ; @xmath85 , @xmath86 , are random vectors with components uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath87 $ ] ; and @xmath88 indicates iterations .",
    "all vector operations are performed componentwise .",
    "the objective function @xmath50 is computed again at the new positions , @xmath89 , of the particles , and the best positions , @xmath61 , @xmath90 , are updated as follows @xmath91 then , the new indices , @xmath66 , are determined and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pso1con ] ) and ( [ eq : pso2con ] ) are applied again and so on .",
    "we note that in the case that the velocity @xmath60 of a particle would move it outside the search space @xmath53 , the particle is actually moved only up to the border of @xmath53 .",
    "the algorithm terminates when a user defined criterion is achieved , which means that a global minimizer is detected .",
    "since in our case the global minimum of the objective function @xmath50 is known a priori to be equal to zero , we consider that a minimum of @xmath50 is located at @xmath92 , if @xmath93 .",
    "if this criterion is not fulfilled , the algorithm stops as soon as a predefined maximum number of iterations , @xmath94 , is reached . in this case , the pso method applied for the particular initial distribution of particles is considered to have failed to compute a @xmath47periodic orbit with the desired accuracy . in our experiments , @xmath94 was set equal to @xmath95 .",
    "let us now discuss the role of the various parameters that appear in eqs.([eq : pso1con ] ) and ( [ eq : pso2con ] ) .",
    "in early versions of pso @xcite there was no actual mechanism to control the magnitude of the particles velocities .",
    "thus , they could take arbitrarily high values ( swarm explosion ) , resulting in divergence of the swarm . for this purpose , a positive parameter , @xmath96 , was employed as a threshold on the absolute value of the velocity s vector components , @xmath97 for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 the dimension of the search space . in more recent versions of pso @xcite ,",
    "the constriction factor @xmath82 has been introduced as a mechanism for constraining the magnitude of the velocities .",
    "stability analysis of the algorithm described by eqs.([eq : pso1con ] ) and ( [ eq : pso2con ] ) results in the following formula for the determination of @xmath82 @xcite , @xmath101 for @xmath102 , where @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "a complete theoretical analysis of the derivation of eq .  ( [ eq : chi ] ) , can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cognitive parameter , @xmath83 , determines the effect of the distance between the current position of the particle and its best previous position , @xmath61 , on its velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the social parameter @xmath84 plays a similar role but it concerns the best previous position , @xmath105 , attained by any particle in the neighborhood .",
    "the particular values of the parameters that were used in our computations are @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "these values are considered optimal default values @xcite .    the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 introduce stochasticity to the algorithm .",
    "therefore , if the best positions are very close to each other and lie in the basin of attraction of a local minimizer of the objective function , then @xmath85 , @xmath86 hinder the particles from getting trapped in that local minimizer , by moving stochastically around it .",
    "this behavior enables the particles to continue searching in potentially better areas of the search space , i.e. , closer to the global minimizer .",
    "thus , instead of moving directly towards the best positions , the particles will oscillate around them .",
    "the size , @xmath54 , of the swarm , as well as the size of the neighborhood in the local variant of pso can be selected arbitrarily , although it is a common belief in evolutionary algorithms that a population size equal from @xmath108 to @xmath109 times the dimension of the problem at hand is a good initial guess @xcite . moreover , the neighborhood s size shall be problem  dependent . in simple problems ,",
    "larger neighborhoods result in faster convergence without loss of the algorithm s efficiency , while , in complicate problems with a plethora of local minima , smaller neighborhoods are considered a better starting choice .      by applying the pso method",
    "we are able to detect one , in general arbitrary , minimizer of the objective function . however , in our case , several minimizers of the objective function are required , since , in general , there exist many @xmath47periodic orbits in the search space , @xmath53 .",
    "restarting the pso algorithm does not guarantee the detection of a different minimizer .",
    "in such cases , the _ deflection _ technique can be used .",
    "this technique consists of a transformation of the objective function , @xmath50 , once a minimizer , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , has been detected ( magoulas , plagianakos & vrahatis 1997 ; parsopoulos & vrahatis 2002 , 2004 ) , @xmath112 with , @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , are nonnegative relaxation parameters , and @xmath116 is the number of the detected minimizers .",
    "the transformed function has exactly the same minimizers with the original @xmath50 , with the exception of @xmath110 .",
    "alternative configurations of the parameter @xmath117 result in different shapes of the transformed function . for larger values of @xmath117",
    "the impact of the deflection technique on the objective function is relatively mild . on the other hand , using @xmath118 results in a function @xmath119 with considerably larger function values in the neighborhood of the deflected minimizer .",
    "a point to notice is that the deflection technique should not be used on its own on a function whose global minimum is zero , as is the case for the function @xmath50 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the transformed function , @xmath119 , of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defl1 ] ) , will also have zero value at the deflected global minimizer , since @xmath50 will be equal to zero at such points .",
    "this problem can be easily alleviated by considering the function @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is a constant , instead of @xmath50 .",
    "the function @xmath122 possesses all the information regarding the minimizers of @xmath50 , but the global minimum is increased from zero to @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath123 does not affect the performance of the algorithm and , thus , if there is no information regarding the global minimum of @xmath50 , it can be selected arbitrarily large .",
    "the effect of the deflection procedure on the function @xmath124 , at the point @xmath125 , is illustrated in fig .",

    "the scheme of applying pso in several phases is more efficient than the immediate search for orbits with initial conditions of the form @xmath147 , because in every phase we were confined in search spaces of dimensionality lower than 4 , which is a computationally easier task .",

    "an analogous transition from a 6:1 to an 8:1 morphology appears at the upper branch of the characteristic of the s family , as can be seen by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : e](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) with figs .",
    "6(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the morphology of the e family at the lower branch of its characteristic is always influenced by the 8:1 resonance ( orbits ( d ) and ( e ) ) , and , as energy increases , the orbits develop loops ( orbit ( e ) ) .",
    "we also note that the unstable orbits of the lower branch of the characteristic have almost straight segments parallel to the bar major axis ( @xmath40 axis ) .",
    "similar morphological evolution was observed also for the s family as can be seen by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : e](d ) and ( e ) with figs .",
    "6(e ) and ( f ) of @xcite .",
    "a new 2d family is born by bifurcation from the e family at @xmath152 .",
    "we call it er1 following the nomenclature in @xcite .",
    "the er1 family has a 9:1 morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : er1 ] ) , in analogy to the sr1 family ( fig .",
    "6(d ) of @xcite ) , which bifurcates from the s family and it is influenced by the 7:1 resonance .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev1 ] , we see the morphological evolution of the ev1 3d family , which bifurcates from the e family at @xmath153 .",
    "we note that the projections of the ev1 orbits on the @xmath149 plane are similar to the planar 2d orbits of the e family for the same energies .",
    "so the ev1 orbits appear as oval - shaped and evolve to a 10:1 morphology .",
    "the te family exists for @xmath154 , and it has similar evolution to the e family . at the upper branch of its characteristic curve ,",
    "there exist stable representatives of the family ( orbits ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",

    "family te has a 10:1 morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : te](a ) ) , which evolves to a morphology influenced by the 12:1 resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : te](c ) ) .",
    "the orbits belonging to the upper branch of the characteristic curve develop ` corners ' along the @xmath131 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : te](c ) ) , while the orbits of the lower branch have segments parallel to the @xmath40 axis ( figs .",
    "[ fig : te](d ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "the 2d family ter1 that bifurcates from family te at @xmath155 is influenced by the 11:1 resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ter1 ] ) ,        while the 3d family tev1 , which bifurcates from family te at @xmath156 , has an oval  shaped projection on the @xmath149 plane ( fig .",

    "in this paper , we proposed and applied an algorithm for locating periodic orbits in a 3d galactic potential . our numerical scheme is based on the transformation of a root  finding problem , i.e. , solving eq.([eq : eq ] ) , into a problem of detecting the global minimizers of function @xmath157 ( eq.[eq : function ] ) .",
    "the detection of the minimizers is performed by the pso method .",
    "this transformation also enables us to use a deflection technique , so that many periodic orbits are traced in one run of the algorithm . by using the proposed algorithm we were able to trace 2d and 3d periodic orbits close to the corotation region in the barred galaxy model described in sec.[pot ] .",
    "our numerical results justify the usefulness of the new scheme , as well as its advantages , which springs from its ability to locate periodic orbits in regions where many periodic orbits coexist very close to each other , even when many of them are unstable .",
    "in addition , even if a periodic orbit is found , newton  like methods can not guarantee that repeating the search with a different initial guess will result in a new periodic orbit .",
    "the proposed scheme alleviates this problem .    in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme , we discuss now in detail its application on the simplest case that we faced in the present paper",
    "this case was the location of planar , 2d , orbits of period @xmath158 , starting perpendicular to the @xmath38 axis , having initial conditions of the form @xmath159 . restricting the search for periodic orbits close to the corotation we set @xmath160 and let @xmath131 varying in the region @xmath161",
    ". in this case the search space of the pso method was 1dimensional and so we used a swarm of @xmath135 particles , while the neighborhood of every particle had radius @xmath136 .",
    "every iteration of the pso method performed the evaluation of the objective function @xmath50 ( eq.[eq : function ] ) with @xmath158 , for @xmath135 times .",
    "this means that we computed the first intersection with the pss of @xmath135 orbits or , in other words , we performed @xmath135 evaluations of @xmath129 ( eq.[eq : phi ] ) , which is the most time consuming computation in every iteration of the pso method . in the particular application we asked the tracing of up to 15 periodic orbits in one run of the algorithm and we succeeded in locating all the planar 2d orbits of families e , te , er1 and ter1 existing in the search space , as well as , several banana  like orbits ( not discussed in the paper ) and orbits belonging to the s family .",
    "all the periodic orbits were located with accuracy of at least @xmath162 .",
    "the whole run performed about 1350 iterations of the pso method ( which means about 90 iterations per periodic orbit ) , involving a total of about 6750 evaluations of @xmath129 .",
    "a main advantage of our approach is that it does not need good initial guesses close to the real initial conditions of the periodic orbits it traces . as an example we refer to the periodic orbit belonging to the ter1 family that was found by the above mentioned run .",
    "this orbit is simple unstable and the usual newton iterative method for finding it , converges to its initial condition @xmath163 for initial guesses of @xmath131 satisfying @xmath164 , after about 10 successive iterations .",
    "we note that in the general case of a 4dimensional pss every iteration of the newton scheme involves the computation of the jacobian matrix of the corresponding set of equations , which requires 4 evaluations of @xmath129 ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in principle , in order to be able to locate all the 2d periodic orbits in the interval @xmath165 $ ] found by the pso method , one should compute all the orbits with initial conditions on a grid of this interval whose grid step should at least be equal to @xmath166 .",
    "these procedure requires about 28500 evaluations of @xmath129 , not taking into account the successive iterations of the newton method to converge to the actual initial condition with the desired accuracy .",
    "we note that in the case of the ter1 periodic orbit this convergence requires about 10 evaluations of @xmath129 .",
    "so it is evident that the computational effort needed by our numerical scheme is significantly lower with respect to the newton iterative method even in the simple case of the 1dimensional search space .    as we pointed out , the main problem that newton  like techniques face in cases where many periodic orbits coexist very close to each other , is that they need a very good initial guess of the position of the periodic orbit in order to find it .",
    "this difficulty of the newton iterative schemes is well known and some efforts to improve their efficiency have already been done . as an example , we refer to the paper of @xcite where the authors evaluate the initial conditions in every successive iteration of the newton scheme by an appropriate least squares technique .",
    "we emphasize that our approach is completely different as we do not try to find the roots of the system of eq.([eq : eq ] ) but we transform this problem into a minimization one",
    ". we also note that our scheme uses only the values of function @xmath167 ( eq . [ eq : phi ] ) and not its derivatives like newton iterative techniques do .",
    "this makes our computation easier and more accurate , since the usual method to evaluate the derivatives of function @xmath167 , which is not known in a close analytical form , is to approximate them by finite differences .    summarizing the main advantages of the proposed algorithm with respect to newton  like methods we could mention that our method is faster",
    ", it is simple and can be implemented easily , it works using function values solely , and also it has the ability to locate many periodic orbits per run .",
    "the orbital behavior of the e and te families and their bifurcations , which were detected by the proposed scheme , as well as the behavior of the s family @xcite , helps us to establish the general behavior of the families existing beyond the radial 4:1 resonance gap in our model .",
    "the morphology of the basic 2d families are influenced by two successive even resonances : the s family is influenced by the 6:1 and 8:1 resonances , the e family is influenced by the 8:1 and 10:1 resonances and the te family by the 10:1 and 12:1 resonances . from these families , 2d families influenced by the in - between odd resonances",
    "bifurcate : sr1 is influenced by the 7:1 resonance , er1 by the 9:1 resonance and ter1 by the 11:1 resonance .",
    "in addition , the main 3d bifurcations of the s , e and te families ( sv1 , ev1 , tev1 families respectively ) have , in general , projections on the @xmath149 plane similar to the main families .",
    "this is in accordance with the observed frequency of the various inner rings morphology @xcite , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we appreciate useful comments from the referee , which helped us improve the clarity of the paper .",
