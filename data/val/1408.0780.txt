    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) results indicate , for the first time , that at least one fundamental neutral scalar , here denoted by @xmath6 , does exists in nature .",
    "moreover , all its properties that have been measured until now are compatible with the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "for instance , it is a spin-0 and charge conjugation and parity symmetry ( cp ) even scalar  @xcite and its couplings with gauge bosons and heavy fermions are compatible with those of the sm within the experimental error @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , the data do not rule out the existence of new physics , in particular , processes induced at loop level have always been important to seek such evidence .",
    "this is the case of the decays @xmath2 and @xmath7 because they may have contributions from new charged particles .",
    "recently , atlas and cms collaborations have measured the decay ratios for both processes  @xcite .",
    "the decay of the higgs boson into two photons is now in agreement with the sm prediction , if compared to 2012 data , but the decay into a photon and a @xmath8 has not been observed yet , however , atlas and cms have presented upper limits for this decay , see table  [ atlas - cms - rates - table ] .",
    "moreover , motivated by physics of the dark matter ( dm ) , neutrinos masses , hierarchy problem , and any other physics beyond the sm , there are many phenomenological models that extend the scalar sector of the sm with one or more scalar multiplets .",
    "in fact , if in the future it becomes clear that dark matter consists of several components , multi - higgs models will be natural candidates .",
    "in particular @xmath9-doublet models with @xmath10 , with or without scalar singlets and triplets , will be interesting possibilities . in particular , the inert higgs doublet model ( idm )",
    "is the simplest model incorporating two dm candidates : one scalar and one pseudo - scalar field .",
    "a two inert doublet model can be obtained from a 3hdm plus a @xmath11 symmetry with the inert doublets being odd and all the other fields are even under @xmath11 .",
    "because of this symmetry , the two inert doublets do not get a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , but the scalar potential is as complicated as the general 3hdm .",
    "the two inert doublets interact with each other as in the case of a general 2hdm i.e. , 10 real dimensionless coupling constants , @xmath12 s .",
    "moreover each inert doublet interacts with the sm - like higgs doublet as a 2hdm+@xmath11 model , i.e. , 10 @xmath12 s more .",
    "it means that a two inert doublet model with just a @xmath11 symmetry implies 23 real dimensionless parameters .",
    "a more economical 3hdm with two doublets being inert can be built by imposing a @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry allows that the symmetry eigenstates be related to the mass eigenstates through a tri - bimaximal - like matrix i.e. , the mixing angles in all the scalar sectors are the same and of the clebsch - gordan coefficients type and there are no arbitrary mixing angles in the scalar sectors .",
    "this is not the case in the general 3hdm with an arbitrary vacuum alignment .",
    "this sort of model was put forward for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite and the @xmath2 branching ratio in this context was considered in @xcite . here",
    "we will revisit this process with the more recent experimental data and also include the @xmath7 process .",
    "we call this model idm@xmath1 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we shown that the model has dm candidates .",
    "the higgs mechanism provides a portal for communication between the inert sector and the known particles .    in the idm and",
    "3hdm@xmath1 the production of the 125 gev higgs is the same as in the sm , however the decays @xmath2 and @xmath7 can receive corrections due to the contributions of charged scalars in loops .",
    "the phenomenology of idm had been extensively discussed : i ) in the context of dm phenomenology  @xcite , ii ) for collider phenomenology  @xcite and , iii ) idm has been also advocated to improve the naturalness idea  @xcite .",
    "however , all these references were published before the lhc data .",
    "the ratios of @xmath13 and @xmath7 were analyzed in the context of a general three higgs doublet model in ref .",
    "however these authors do not consider the case of two inert doublet and , unlike the present model , their model has arbitrary mixing matrices in the scalar sectors .",
    "special attention requires the @xmath3 rare decay since the current first attempt of measure this channel at lhc run 1 shed an upper limit of one order of magnitude respect to the sm prediction ( @xmath14  =  1 ) , see table  [ atlas - cms - rates - table ] .",
    "this is because the available luminosity at lhc is not sensitive enough to collect sufficient data of this process .",
    "specifically , atlas  @xcite has reported an upper limit of 11 times the sm expectation using a luminosity of 4.5 fb@xmath15 of @xmath16 collisions at @xmath17 tev and 20.3 fb@xmath15 at @xmath18 tev ; cms  @xcite reported an upper limit of 9.5 times the sm prediction , with integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb@xmath15 and 19.6 fb@xmath15 at @xmath16 collisions of 7 tev and 8 tev , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the future of the detection of @xmath3 seems a difficult task according to the future lhc upgrades schedule @xcite : at lhc run 3 with 14 tev will allow to collect 300 fb@xmath15 of data where the precision on the signal strength is expected to be @xmath19 at atlas and @xmath20 at cms , and at run 6 with 3000 fb@xmath15 the precision is expected to be @xmath21 at atlas and @xmath22 at cms .",
    "therefore , an accurate value for this decay will be one of the last data obtained by the lhc , but it is possible to predict the behavior of this decay from the process @xmath2 in the idm@xmath1 due to the correlation of their common parameters , specifically we estimate considering up to @xmath23 deviation from the experimental @xmath24 data , that it is not possible a positive deviation larger than 1.16 times the sm value , nor a suppression beyond 0.96 .",
