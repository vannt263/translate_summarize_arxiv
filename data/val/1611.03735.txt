    "recently the fermi - lat collaboration reported detection of pulsed gev gamma - rays from the young pulsar psr j0540 - 6919 ( hereafter j0540 ) in the large magellanic cloud @xcite , which is the first gamma - ray pulsar detected in another galaxy .",
    "although , j0540 shares many similarities with the crab pulsar and is often called `` crab s twin '' , its isotropic , pulsed gamma - ray emission exceeds the crab pulsar s by a factor of 20 .",
    "the spin period of this pulsar is @xmath0ms , the rotation power is @xmath1erg s@xmath2 , while the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder is @xmath3 g .",
    "similarly to the crab pulsar , j0540 also reveals the pulsed emission in radio , x - ray and optical domains , and it is very important to note that these emission components are aligned .",
    "however , unlike the case of the crab pulsar , the shape of the pulse varies over the different bands ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the pulsed radio emission exhibits two narrow peaks separated by @xmath4 in pulse phase . for the higher frequencies",
    "the double - peak pattern is not that clearly pronounced , but it can be still noticed on top of a broader profile",
    ". however , the phase - alignment of the measured signal peaks seems to indicate that the emission in different energy bands is generated in the same spatial region of the pulsar magnetosphere . in the present paper",
    "we develop a model that explains the presence of the phase - alignment of these signals .",
    "the model naturally leads to the explanation of other observed emission features of the j0540 pulsar .",
    "we assume that the observed emission is formed in the electron - positron ( @xmath5 ) plasma of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the basis for the pulsar emission models is the process of the birth of electron - positron pairs @xcite .",
    "a spinning magnetized neutron star generates an electric field directed along the open magnetic field lines , the field extracts electrons from the star s surface forming a low number density ( @xmath6 plasma , where @xmath7 is the magnetic field at the star s surface , @xmath8 is the pulsar spin period , @xmath9 is the electron s charge and @xmath10 is the speed of light ) .",
    "the primary beam of particles with energies @xmath11 @xcite is created .",
    "the particles moving along the magnetic field lines radiate @xmath12-quanta , which , in turn , produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "the pitch angle of the particles which are being produced is non - zero , so that secondary particles generate synchrotron radiation .",
    "this radiation , in turn , produces more and more pairs until the plasma becomes sufficiently dense to screen the `` parent '' electric field . as a result",
    "a multicomponent magnetospheric plasma is formed . in this medium different plasma processes",
    "may develop , resulting in emission generation , observed as a pulsed radiation from pulsars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we describe the emission model , in section three we consider the possibility of re - acceleration of the beam electrons far from the star surface , in the fourth section , on the basis of our model , we derive the theoretical synchrotron spectrum for the high and the very high energy @xmath12-ray emission of the j0540 pulsar and in the concluding , fifth section we discuss our results .",
    "according to the observations j0540 reveals both low - frequency radio also the high - frequency x - ray and @xmath12-ray pulsed emission .",
    "we do assume that the whole spectrum is generated in the magnetospheric @xmath5 plasma .",
    "for explaining the radio emission of pulsars one of the very first models was a polar - cap model , which surmises that bunches of charged particles , moving along the curved magnetic field lines , are emitting in the radio range via the curvature radiation process @xcite . assuming that along the field lines move magnetopsheric electrons and positrons , we investigate possible mechanisms of radiation generation in the @xmath5 plasma .    for the radio frequencies the analogy of curvature emission in the @xmath5 plasma",
    "was exstensively studied , bearing in mind the well - known fact that the relativistic particles emit radiation while moving along curved magnetic field line . in this case",
    ", one has to take into account the wave interference as @xmath13 ( here n is the number density of plasma particles and @xmath14 is wave - length ) .",
    "it was shown that the emission generated by flux of plasma particles through this mechanism is suppressed via the wave interference process @xcite .",
    "later the influence of inhomogeneity on the development of this process was also studied . in particular , it was clarified how the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field influences the onset of emission generation in magnetospheric plasma @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that @xmath5 plasma can generate radiation in the radio domain through the modified curvature mechanism , the so called cherenkov - curvature mechanism that occurs at the resonance : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the drift velocity of the particles caused by the curvature of the field lines , @xmath17 is the curvature radius of the field line , @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is the pulsar magnetic field and @xmath20 is the electron mass . a weak inhomogeneity of the magnetic field results in a curvature drift motion of a particle directed normally to the local plane of the magnetic field line .",
    "it is important to emphasize that three factors are essential for the efficient realization of this type of emission :    1 .",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the existence of spatial inhomogeneity of the field .",
    "3 .   the refraction index of the medium has to be larger than unity .",
    "the drift motion of the particles violates the axial symmetry of the considered process .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular components of electric field of waves are coupled , provoking appearance of additional terms in the dispersion relation , maintaining the resonance condition ( 1 ) .",
    "the problem of the generation of electromagnetic radio waves in the infinitely large magnetic field approximation @xmath21 was thoroughly examined in @xcite . in these papers",
    "the inhomogeneity of the medium is neglected and one considers the oblique propagation of waves , which again leads to the violation of the axial symmetry .",
    "even when the wave vector is supposed to have the following form @xmath22 it does not result in the separation of the parallel and perpendicular components of the wave electric field vector @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the dispersion relation .",
    "this circumstance , by itself , is responsible for the appearance of the terms containing the cherenkov resonance in the dispersion relation : @xmath25    since it appears to be a cherenkov - type resonance , it immediately follows that the presence of a sub - luminous wave with the phase velocity smaller than the speed of light is essential .",
    "it is well known that if the speed of a charged particle exceeds the medium speed of light the cherenkov radiation is generated @xcite . for the high - frequency radiation",
    "the pulsar magnetospheric plasma appears to be transparent , because in this case the average distance between the plasma particles @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the emission of individual particles is adding up without wave - interference effects .",
    "furthermore , apart from the above - mentioned reasons , the wave generation processes in the pulsar magnetosphere also depends on the form of the distribution function of plasma particles .",
    "it is important that the number of particles generating emission is larger than the number of those particles that absorb radiation . for the magnetospheric @xmath5 plasma the distribution function",
    "@xmath27 contains areas , where @xmath28 and the wave generation through the resonances ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) happens to be possible .",
    "it is well - known that the plasma distribution function is one - dimensional , as electrons and positrons loose their perpendicular momenta in a very short time ( @xmath29s ) due to synchrotron radiation in a very strong pulsar magnetic field near the star surface .",
    "yet another essential plasma process that makes the one - dimensional plasma unstable is cyclotron - cherenkov instability , developing at the anomalous cyclotron resonance @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the lorentz factor of the resonant particles and the resonance condition is written for the weakly inhomogeneous magnetic field case . in vacuum conditions the anomalous doppler effect can not be realized . in the present work",
    "we investigate in more details the anomalous cyclotron resonance and apply it for the explanation of the observed emission properties of the j0540 pulsar .",
    "the one - dimensional distribution function , appearing due to specifics of the magnetosphere filling with charged particles , has the shape shown on fig.1 @xcite and consists of the following two components :    * the bulk of plasma with the particle concentration at the neutron star s surface @xmath32@xmath33 and the lorentz - factor @xmath34 ( the dipolar magnetic field ) or @xmath35 ( the quadrupole magnetic field ) @xcite ; * the long , extended , one - dimensional tail of the distribution function with @xmath36 , @xmath37@xmath33 and the most energetic primary beam with @xmath38 and @xmath39@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensionality of the distribution function is a reason for the development of the plasma instability that results in wave excitation when the resonance condition ( 3 ) is met .",
    "as the estimations show , for the typical pulsar parameters , wave excited through the anomalous cyclotron resonance belong to the radio frequency range . at the quasilinear stage of this process",
    "the generated radio waves affect inversely the unperturbed distribution function and lead to the particle diffusion along and across the magnetic field .",
    "this , in its turn , leads to the stabilization of the instability . through this process",
    "the particles obtain the perpendicular momenta and start to radiate through the synchrotron mechanism in much higher frequency domain !",
    "these high - frequency waves satisfy @xmath40 condition and the system ceases to be closed .",
    "therefore , the radio an high frequency emission are both generated simultaneously and in the same spatial location of the pulsar magnetosphere that may naturally explain the observational evidence for the pulse - peak coincidence for different frequency ranges .",
    "we will show below that the radio waves can be generated via the anomalous doppler effect only on the periphery of the pulsar magnetosphere , on the distances of the order of the `` light cylinder radius '' , i.e. , the distance from the pulsar , where the linear velocity of rotation matches the speed of light .",
    "in reality , when the light cylinder surface is being approached , the magnetic field lines start to bend in the opposite direction of the star rotation .    in order to analyze the resonance condition ( 3 )",
    "one needs to know the properties of the fundamental modes of @xmath5 plasma .",
    "they were investigated in a series of works @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in @xmath5 three branches of wave modes can propagate tangentially to the magnetic field lines , can escape the magnetosphere and reach an observer : the purely transversal mode with electric field perpendicular to * k * -*b * plane and longitudinal - transverse waves with the electric field in the * k * -*b * plane with two branches : the ordinary and the alfvn mode . for small angles of propagation with respect to the magnetic field ( @xmath41 ) the dispersion relations for these waves in the laboratory frame can be written as [ @xmath42 : @xmath43 [ ] @xmath44 [ ] @xmath45 [ ]    it should be noted that these waves are frequently called x , o and a modes .",
    "in the next section we will consider in detail the excitation of an extraordinary ( x ) mode , hereafter referred to as `` t - waves '' .",
    "let us insert the expression ( 4 ) into resonance condition ( 3)and use the expansions for the following quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then we will get @xmath49 the first three terms on the left hand - side of the equation ( 7 ) are positive and it is clear that in order to satisfy this equation one needs the following condition to be satisfied : @xmath50 however , this condition does not exclude the possibility of the equality @xmath51 , which guarantees that the condition ( 8) holds for the resonant particles with the high lorentz factors .",
    "the mentioned condition , when @xmath52 will take the form : @xmath53 when the following condition is satisfied : @xmath54 the emission beams coming from radiation generation region form tapered segment and the section of this cone has the shape shown on fig .",
    "2 . if the observer s line of sight intersects the hollow part of the cone then the detected emission will have the observed two - peak profile .",
    "this type of emission is frequently called conal - emission @xcite . the angular distance between the pulse peaks",
    "is defined from the condition ( 10 ) .",
    "although , it should be mentioned that the presence of two - peaks in the emission profile can be also interpreted in other ways : the orthogonal rotator or the almost aligned rotator @xcite . however , for the first case the distance between the peaks must be of the order of @xmath55 and for the second case generation of the emission from different frequency bands happens in different locations in the pulsar magnetosphere and it is not possible to have the pulse - phase coincidence for them .",
    "let us estimate the quantities @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "assuming that at the star surface @xmath58@xmath33 and that this quantity reduces with a cubic law , just like the magnetic field does , the plasma particle number density at the light cylinder distances will be @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 cm is the neutron star radius and @xmath61 cm is the radius of the light cylinder ) . according to @xcite",
    "one can write for the magnetic field at the light cylinder @xmath62 g .",
    "consequently we will get @xmath63 .    from the resonance condition ( 7 ) and the equation ( 8) one can estimate the frequency of the waves generated through the cyclotron resonance : @xmath64 the region where the waves are generated",
    "is located in the periphery area of the magnetosphere , where the magnetic field lines start to change their actual curvature ( let us assume that @xmath65 cm ) . from the expression ( 11 ) one can see that near the light cylinder radio waves of the order of ghz are generated when the resonant particles are the fastest primary beam electrons with the lorentz factors @xmath66 . in this case",
    "@xmath67 , which comes in agreement with the estimated distance between the pulse peaks from the observations @xcite .    frequently from pulsar observations modes with the orthogonal electric fields @xcite are found .",
    "this observable feature is very natural for the plasma model presented in this work , as in pulsar pair plasma both @xmath68 and @xmath69 waves are generated .",
    "now let us consider excitation of @xmath69 waves through the cyclotron resonance .",
    "the dispersion relation for these waves is described by equation ( 5 ) and after applying it to the resonance condition ( 3 ) one can get : @xmath70 from this equation one can see that the second term has no impact on the wave generation condition , which implies that the @xmath69-waves fill the entire emission cone when generated through the anomalous doppler resonance . the wave generation takes place in a small angle range , for @xmath69 waves @xmath71 .",
    "contrary to this , for the @xmath68-waves , the emission beams are limited from both sides @xmath72 ( see condition ( 9 ) ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , while generated via the cherenkov resonance , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 waves are forming the hollow cone @xcite .",
    "we assume that the absence of the second mode and the high linear polarization of the radio pulses at 1 ghz would be a good argument in favour of our emission model .",
    "in this section we consider processes taking place in @xmath5 plasma in the area , which is much smaller than value of @xmath17 .",
    "the pair plasma in the pulsar magnetosphere bears cylindrical symmetry and it is convenient to describe the processes in the momentum space in the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "after one finds the average over the azimuthal angle the process can be described in two - dimensional space of momenta @xmath73 and @xmath74 along and across the magnetic field lines .",
    "the back reaction of the generated waves on the resonant particles distribution function in the @xmath5 plasma is described via the quasi - linear equation @xcite .",
    "we are interested to find the function @xmath75 , which describes the particle distribution across the magnetic field after the quasi - linear diffusion causes the particle redistribution .",
    "the equation describing this process can be written as : @xmath76.\\ ] ] here the perpendicular component of the synchrotron radiation reaction force is : @xmath77 and the diffusion coefficient : @xmath78 the term containing the orthogonal diffusion coefficient in eq .",
    "( 13 ) ensures appearance of perpendicular momenta and their growth and the term containing the orthogonal reaction force slows this process down .",
    "it leads to the balance of the processes and the perpendicular distribution function will remain stationary @xmath79 .",
    "( 13 ) in this case has a simple solution .",
    "when the condition @xmath80 is met one can write it as : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the pitch angle of the resonant particles and @xmath83 when the condition @xmath84 is satisfied the solutions is written in the following form : @xmath85 where the mean value of the pitch angle has the following , different value : @xmath83 the process of quasi - linear diffusion causes appearance of pitch angles that inevitably causes activation of the synchrotron radiation mechanism . as the resonant particles are the fastest beam electrons , they emit a high - frequency radiation through the synchrotron regime . indeed , the characteristic photon energy emitted by relativistic electrons through the synchrotron radiation process is @xmath86gev @xcite .",
    "if we use eq .",
    "( 19 ) for the mean value of the pitch angle , where one can assume @xmath87 , we obtain @xcite @xmath88 the estimations show that the beam electrons with the lorentz factor @xmath89 radiate @xmath12-photons with the energy of the order of 0.1gev .",
    "consequently , the optical and x - ray emission is generated via secondary plasma electrons @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these secondary plasma particles generate through the described mechanisms the low frequency emission of the order of @xmath92hz and @xmath93hz and for this domain the angle @xmath94 reduces .",
    "this interesting circumstance can be used to test the presented model .    according to the equations ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) , the synchrotron emission has the different nature from radio emission and the conditions ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) do not play a role for it .",
    "unlike the radio emission case , the wavelength of the high - frequency emission is @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the waves do not `` feel '' the medium and there is no need to take into account the wave interference .",
    "we assume that the broadening of the pulse profile in the higher frequency range can be explained via redistribution of particles by pitch angles .",
    "it is worth noting that flattening of pulse profiles for the optical , x - ray and gamma - ray emission is also observed for the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "it is clear that when the above described processes develop the resultant synchrotron emission power is fed by the longitudinal kinetic energy of the resonant particles , which is also partly spent on the radio wave generation .",
    "the maximum intensity of the high - frequency emission comes on the maximum photon quantity , while the latter is proportional to the density of emitting particles multiplied on the lorentz factor .",
    "in this paper some aspects of the extremely bright gamma - ray pulsar in the large magellanic cloud ( j0540 ) are considered .",
    "they are easily interpreted in the framework of the pulsar emission model developed in @xcite .",
    "in particular we found out that :    1 .",
    "the possibility of the instability development is considered , which leads to the generation of radio emission at the anomalous doppler resonance .",
    "it is demonstrated that at this resonance a `` conal '' type of emission can be generated .",
    "we argue that this could explain the presence of the double peak radio emission feature .",
    "it is shown that at the quasilinear stage of the instability development the one - dimensional distribution function will acquire pitch angles .",
    "the latter opens the possibility for the generation of the high - frequency synchrotron emission .",
    "simultaneous generation of radio and high - frequency emission in the same , spatially confined domain naturally explains the observed coincidence of the emission peaks at different frequencies ( phase - alignment ) .",
    "numerical studies show good agreement of the theoretical estimation of the distance between the peaks in radio range with the observed one .",
    "6 .   in the framework of the suggested model , on the basis of the quasilinear diffusion calculation ,",
    "the distribution over the pitch angles is determined .",
    "the latter naturally explains the observed broadening of the pulses at higher frequencies relative to radio pulse shapes .",
    "7 .   often in pulsar emission subpulses",
    "two different modes are detected with mutually orthogonal electric fields @xcite , which is quite expectable because both t and lt waves are generated . in our case",
    "the presence of double peaks at the frequency of the order of ghz is interpreted as the `` conal '' emission generated at the anomalous doppler resonance .",
    "we have shown that this kind of emission is possible only for t - waves .",
    "therefore , observed radio emission pulses of the order ghz has to be characterized by the high degree of linear polarization and the absence of the second mode .",
    "8 .   a generic connection between low - frequency ( @xmath96 ) and high - frequency ( from the optical to x - ray and gamma ) emission is found out .",
    "it turns out that lorentz factors for the generation of optical and x - ray emission have to be @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "it has to lead to the decrease of the distance between the peaks in the radio range .",
    "it may be used as an important observational test for the verification of the suggested model .",
