    "optical detection of pulsars aid in the development and constraining of theoretical models of pulsar electromagnetic radiation .",
    "psr1706 - 44 belongs to the set of seven @xmath1-ray pulsars detected by egret ( thompson et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the optical it has not been detected yet .",
    "detection of the optical counterparts of radio and gamma - ray pulsars is often complicated by field crowding by other stars in the optical bands .",
    "the field of this pulsar was observed with the _ vlt_-ut1 on august 19 , 1998 ( sv phase ) .",
    "the details of observation , analysis and theoretical implications are given in lundqvist et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "chakrabarty and kaspi ( 1998 ) ( ck98 ) using the radio position of the pulsar as summarised in their paper estimate that the pulsar should lie @xmath2 away from the star 1 .",
    "the combined error in position of the optical counterpart of the radio pulsar from various sources is @xmath3 .",
    "measuring the background at a distance of @xmath4 from nearby bright star 1 in the vlt data shows that an artificial star with @xmath5 can be detected at more than 3@xmath6 level . to estimate how bright a star one could hide in the psf of star 1 we subtracted artificial stars from this position until a hole appeared in the background .",
    "it is possible to hide a point source ( @xmath7 ) at a distance of @xmath8 from the star 1 . as an upper limit for a pulsar this close to star 1 we claim @xmath9 .",
    "the optical fluxes may be correlated with the gamma - ray photon fluxes in outer gap models ( see e.g. usov ( 1994 ) and cheng , ho & ruderman ( 1986a , 1986b ) ) for vela - like pulsars . assuming @xmath10 to be the same in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands , the magnitudes predicted by the outer gap models are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "our faint @xmath11 limit , in comparison to the predictions of the standard outer - gap model , scaled from gamma - ray flux ( @xmath14 ) , requires a low frequency cutoff in its synchrotron emission spectrum .",
    "if the magnetic axis inclination with respect to spin axis @xmath15 , the synchrotron cutoff frequency is @xmath16 hz and in that case the flux of optical radiation may be very small .",
