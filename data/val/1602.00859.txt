    "they showed how to calculate the epidemic threshold ( i.e. , strength of infection above which infection can remain prevalent in the population ) and the prevalence ( i.e. , fraction of infected nodes in the stationary state ) in terms of the spectral radius of a relevant matrix .",

    "we show theoretical and numerical evidence that the epidemic threshold decreases ( i.e. , infection is more likely to occur ) as the network becomes more temporal in the sense that the network changes more slowly ( but not quiescent ) relative to the time scale of the epidemic process .",

    "we have provided evidence that the epidemic threshold for the sis model on temporal networks is smaller than that for the corresponding static networks for arbitrary temporal networks .",
    "we have also shown that the degree of commutativity of the adjacency matrices of the snapshot networks predicts the impact of temporality of the network on the epidemic threshold .",
    "our results are opposite to the previous results concluding that infection in the sis model is less likely in temporal than static networks @xcite . however , our results do not contradict theirs , for which the aggregate network obtained from the temporal network is not equal to the static network used for comparison .",
    "in contrast , we compared temporal networks with static networks such that they are the same if we ignore the temporal information in the former .    in the discrete - time sis model on temporal networks @xcite , the epidemic threshold is larger for the temporal network than the corresponding aggregate network when a sequence of snapshots is randomly drawn with replacement ( appendix  [ sec : discrete time ] ) .",
    "this result is opposite to the current results for the continuous - time dynamics . because a discrete - time model is a proxy to the continuous - time counterpart , which is usually more realistic , the present continuous - time framework is useful .",
    "for instance , the discrete - time sis model implicitly assumes that , for time @xmath6 , each node is allowed to make at most one transition between the infected and susceptible states .",
    "therefore , the propagation speed is restricted , which is not the case in the continuous - time framework .",
    "in particular , the discrete and continuous - time versions only coincide when @xmath60 , in which limit both reduce to the sis model on the aggregate network .",
    "we modelled temporal networks by switching networks .",
    "in practice , we can not manipulate the duration of each snapshot ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) because it is specified by the data , reflecting the temporal resolution of the observation .",
    "rather , our interpretation of @xmath6 is the relative time scale between the epidemic dynamics and network dynamics . a large @xmath6 , with which the epidemic threshold decreases , corresponds to fast epidemic dynamics relative to network dynamics .",
    "the present results imply that infection is pronounced when the network varies over time ( i.e. , temporal network ) but only slowly .",
    "in this situation , there are times when some snapshots strongly favour infection as compared to typical snapshots , and such snapshots enhance infection more than other snapshots suppress it .",
    "it should be noted that the time scale of the epidemic dynamics does not affect the equilibrium of the sis model in the case of static networks .",
    "a future extension of the model may relax the assumption of equal duration @xmath6 of each snapshot and explore the effect of a ( possibly broad ) distribution of time spans . in a further step ,",
    "a dependence of @xmath6 on the nodes state may be considered to model contact avoidance and quarantine of infected nodes .",
    "our commutativity result opens the way to contain infection by devising the set of snapshots without changing @xmath6 or the structure of the aggregate network . in a hospital",
    ", it may be undesirable to change aggregate interactions between doctors , nurses , and patients because the amount of the interactions may be positively correlated with service quality .",
    "we can increase the epidemic threshold ( therefore , less epidemic ) by designing a sequence of interactions such that the corresponding adjacency matrices commute as much as possible .",
    "the method explained in appendix  [ sec : model c ] is useful in systematically generating commuting adjacency matrices . for a similar attempt in synchronisation dynamics using single - link snapshot networks , see  @xcite",
    "the adjacency matrices obviously commute when the snapshots do not have any nodes in common .",
    "therefore , designing interactions such that different sets of nodes are active at different times as much as possible may be effective at increasing the epidemic threshold .",
    "this point warrants further work .",
    "examining the influence of @xmath6 on the epidemic threshold and the relevance of the commutativity of the adjacency matrices in more complex compartmental models of epidemic dynamics also warrants future work .",
    "the qs method is used for computing the average prevalence in the sis model in finite populations @xcite .",
    "the qs method for the sis model in static networks works as follows .",
    "we distinguish active states , which are configurations with at least one infected node , from the absorbing state , which is the configuration with no infected nodes .",
    "we keep a total of @xmath142 active states in memory .",
    "after one update event in the sis model , we are either in an active or an absorbing state . if an active state is reached , it replaces a randomly chosen state in the memory with the probability proportional to the expected time to the next update , where the proportionality constant is set to @xmath143 .",
    "it should be noted that the probability does not exceed unity because the mean time to recovery is normalised to unity such that the expected time to the next update in the entire network is less than unity .",
    "if the absorbing state is reached , one active state is chosen uniformly at random from the memory to replace the absorbing state .",
    "after a transient of @xmath144 time units , the qs is calculated as the average of the system s state over the next @xmath144 time units .",
    "we modified the qs method for temporal networks .",
    "our implementation is slightly different from that in ref .",

    "in other words , @xmath146 . the qs may depend on @xmath147 , i.e. , the time since the beginning of the current snapshot .",
    "therefore , for different values of @xmath147 and the current snapshot , we generate a memory , i.e. , a list of active states to be used when the process dies . to this end",

    "if the process reaches the absorbing state at time @xmath156 , the network state is replaced by an active state randomly chosen from the memory corresponding to the elapsed time @xmath152 and the current snapshot .",
    "then , the process is restarted at time @xmath157 . after a transient of time @xmath158 , where @xmath19 is the number of snapshots , we calculate the steady state as the fraction of the infected nodes averaged over the @xmath159 subsequent measurements conducted when snapshots switch from one to another .",

    "<S> data of physical contacts and face - to - face communications suggest temporally varying networks as the media on which infections take place among humans and animals . </S>",
    "<S> epidemic processes on temporal networks are complicated by complexity of both network structure and temporal dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical approaches are much needed for identifying key factors that affect dynamics of epidemics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , what factors make some temporal networks stronger media of infection than other temporal networks is under debate . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theory to understand the susceptible - infected - susceptible epidemic model on arbitrary temporal networks , where each contact is used for a finite duration . </S>",
    "<S> we show that temporality of networks lessens the epidemic threshold such that infections persist more easily in temporal networks than in their static counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the lie commutator bracket of the adjacency matrices at different times is a key determinant of the epidemic threshold in temporal networks . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of temporality on the epidemic threshold , which depends on a data set , is approximately predicted by the magnitude of a commutator norm . </S>",
