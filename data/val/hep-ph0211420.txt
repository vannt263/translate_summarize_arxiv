    "( 22),(24 ) , they could be treated as ordinary independent errors if the aleph and opal covariance matrices were fully independent .",
    "however , the covariance matrices have a common component since the two experiments share uncertainties due to common normalization input ( _ i.e. _ , opal used the 96/97 pdg results for the tau branching ratios and these were dominated by aleph measurements )",
    ". we do not have the detailed knowledge to determine exactly the degree of correlation induced in the output of our aleph and opal analyses .",
    "therefore , we have performed the averaging assuming a generic correlation coefficient @xmath164 between the aleph and opal results .",

    "the above numbers represent our determination of the electroweak penguin matrix elements in the chiral limit , where a data - driven evaluation has been possible .",
    "however , to make contact with phenomenology , an estimate of the chiral corrections is mandatory .",
    "this issue has been studied by two of us in ref .",
    "@xcite within nlo chiral perturbation theory . at this order",
    "there are two contributions to the chiral corrections : one is given by the chiral loops and comes with no uncertainty , while the other is due to local couplings in the effective theory , not known accurately at present . a conservative estimate of these couplings , based on naive dimensional analysis ( and supported by an explicit calculation in leading @xmath169  @xcite ) , gives ^physical_7,8 = m^chiral_7,8 f _  , where @xmath170 represents the dispersive and absorptive corrections ( generated at nlo ) to the matrix elements ,  @xcite f _ = ( 0.7 0.2 ) - i 0.21  .",

    "we observe that other analyses of the v - a correlator exist in the literature  @xcite which give generally different values of the ope coefficients from those found here ( especially for the @xmath81 with @xmath175 ) .",

    "when necessary , we have converted the lattice results to the @xmath10-ndr scheme at @xmath177 gev . moreover , lattice results are obtained in the quenched approximation and the quoted error is only statistical .",
    "finally , let us recall that other determinations of electroweak matrix elements can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our value for @xmath178 is slightly higher than the lattice determinations . however , the agreement is better than previous work had indicated .",
    "the present lattice results are larger than earlier lattice estimates while our new result is about one standard deviation below our previous central value . given that the lattice results are in the quenched limit , the present level of agreement is satisfactory .",
    "lattice estimates of @xmath179 are also in agreement with our results .",
    "finally , the results of refs .  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite also seem in reasonable agreement with ours , with the possible exception of the smaller @xmath179 result of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this paper has described an improved chiral determination of the electroweak penguin contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "let us summarize the nature of the improvement over our previous result . recall that our determinations are not calculations in the usual sense of constructing an approximation to qcd which",
    "is then used to calculate the operator matrix element .",
    "rather , our methods start from the observation that the matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operators @xmath180 become related in the chiral limit to the vacuum matrix elements of two other operators , and that these vacuum matrix elements can be determined from existing experimental data . our previous determinations and those of the present paper are based on different approaches to extracting these vacuum matrix elements .",
    "much of our work has been devoted to minimizing the impact on our final uncertainties of both the absence of spectral data above @xmath92 and the presence of large experimental errors near the upper end of the kinematically accessible range .",
    "a detailed understanding of these uncertainties has also been obtained .",
    "our earlier chiral determination of @xmath17_{\\rm ewp}$ ] ( _ cf . _",
    "( [ old ] ) ) was based on the use of other rigorous chiral sum rules in order to minimize the effect where the data were poor or non - existent .",
    "this is a very direct approach , and we found that it carried a 32% uncertainty .",
    "the error bar was partially due to the residual experimental uncertainty from the tau decay data .",
    "however the error bar also had a large component due to uncertainties in the inputs to the other chiral sum rules which were used as constraints , the largest of which involved the pion s electromagnetic mass difference in the chiral limit .",
    "for example , at @xmath181 gev ( where it is safe to neglect higher dimensional contributions ) the result was a determination of @xmath178 with @xmath16 uncertainty .",
    "roughly @xmath182 of the error on the dispersive integral @xmath183 is due to uncertainties in the inputs to the chiral sum rule constraints , the dominant contribution being the above - mentioned uncertainty in the chiral limit value of the pion electromagnetic mass splitting .",
    "the present evaluation , based on the fesr method , does not use the chiral sum rules and hence does not share the same uncertainties .",
    "rather , the fesr error bars arise primarily from uncertainties in the tau decay data .",
    "we use doubly pinched weights in the fesr integrals both to minimize the influence of these data uncertainties and also to suppress ope contributions from the vicinity of the timelike real axis . presumably , the latter effect serves to improve the reliability of the ope representation for @xmath43 . to perform a highly nontrivial check of this presumption",
    ", we extract each ope coefficient @xmath81 with more than one weight . in all cases ,",
    "excellent consistency is found .",
    "an instructive demonstration is provided by figs .",
    "3,4 , which involve the determination of @xmath3 and @xmath106 using the weights @xmath102 and @xmath184 .",
    "by design , @xmath102 and @xmath184 have very different profiles and thus probe the spectral function in very different ways .",
    "the spectral integrals for both the @xmath185-weighted fesr s turn out to scale very closely with @xmath186 ( each case implying that the @xmath187 contribution is small ) and the consistency between the @xmath3 values thus extracted turns out to be excellent .",
    "our procedure has passed a number of additional tests , as will be described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite therefore , once one makes sure that the systematics of the fesr approach are under control , the fesr analysis leads to a more precise determination of @xmath178 , because it exploits in an optimal manner the existing database and ( unlike the rwm ) does not rely on other input .",
    "when we translate the measurement of the ope coefficient into the electroweak penguin contribution to @xmath188 , we find _ ewp , -lim = ( - 15.0 2.7 ) 10 ^ -4  , [ new ] in the chiral limit .",
    "this is consistent with our previous determination , but has about half ( at @xmath189 ) the uncertainty .",
    "when we include the chiral corrections as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : chcorr ] , we find _ ewp , phys = ( - 11.0 3.6 ) 10 ^ -4  .",
    "[ new2 ] the larger error ( about @xmath16 ) cited for the ` physical ' result reflects uncertainties in our estimate for the chiral corrections .",
    "we note that for the standard model to successfully describe @xmath188 will require a rather large and positive effect from the standard gluonic penguin operator @xmath8 .",
    "our approach does not provide a determination of this matrix element .",
    "in addition to describing the electroweak penguin contribution to @xmath188 , our work is useful in other contexts .",
    "we have a firm determination of the @xmath9 nonleptonic matrix element in the chiral limit as well as that for @xmath190 , and there are few such examples that are experimentally known .",
    "the results are useful for comparison with models , some of which are included in the comparisons table in sect .",
    "iv - c , or for the testing of lattice methods .",
    "our methods may also be adapted rather directly to lattice techniques , because the correlation functions that we work with are readily measured with lattice data .",
