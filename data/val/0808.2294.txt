    "higher x - ray emissivity arcs , termed ripples , are observed in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the perseus cluster ( fabian et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) , as well as in a2052 ( blanton et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the ripples are thought to be sound waves that are excited by the inflation of bubbles near the cluster s center .",
    "some of the ripples are observed on the outer edge of bubbles ; they are compressed icm that will turn into shock waves , and later to sound waves .",
    "it is possible that some of the other ripples are compressed by weak jets ( soker & pizzolato 2005 ) , rather than being sound waves detached from their parent bubble . beside being interesting by their own merit",
    ", the sound waves can heat the icm and partially offset the radiative cooling of the icm ( e.g. , brggen et al . 2005 ; fabian et al . 2005 ; fujita & suzuki 2005 ; graham et al . 2008 ) .    to obtain repeated sound waves previous numerical simulations assumed repeating bubble inflation episodes ( e.g. , ruszkowski et al .",
    "2004a , b ; sijacki & springel 2006a , b ) .",
    "this had to be done because these simulations used _ artificial bubbles _ ,",
    "i.e. , numerically injected spherical bubbles at off - center locations , as is commonly done ( e.g. , brggen 2003 ; brggen & kaiser 2001 ; gardini 2007 ; jones & de young 2005 ; pavlovski et al . 2008 ; reynolds et al . 2005 ; robinson et al . 2004 ; ruszkowski et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b , 2007 , 2008 ; scannapieco & brggen 2008 ) .",
    "this of course is not the way bubbles are formed in clusters .",
    "bubble are formed by jets [ a different approach of injecting magnetic energy instead of a jet ( nakamura et al .",
    "2008 ; xu et al .",
    "2008 ) requires further study ] .",
    "when large , almost spherical bubbles ( termed _ fat bubbles _ ) are inflated by jets , some phenomena appear , that are not revealed when artificial bubbles are used ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) . among these",
    "are : ( 1 ) more stable bubbles , and ( 2 ) bubble - icm boundary that is stochastically vibrates due to the vortices inside the bubble and the back flowing icm .    in previous works we found that in order for the jets to inflate fat bubbles they should have a large opening angle , or they should rapidly precess ( soker 2004 , 2006 ; sternberg et al . 2007",
    "; sternberg & soker 2008a ) .",
    "in addition , jets that are relatively slow , @xmath2 , and with a mass loss rate of the order of @xmath3 ( for both jets ) , are more likely to inflate fat bubbles .",
    "the same results can be seen in the simulations of omma et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , alouani bibi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and binney et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who use similar parameters to ours , but instead of conical jets with wide opening angles they use cylindrical jets with large initial radius .",
    "this is also shown by the simulation of heinz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who manages to inflate a bubble ( although not a bubble attached to the center ) by launching a jet with a velocity of @xmath4 and a mass loss rate of @xmath5 in one jet . in this paper",
    "we continue our study of jet - inflated bubbles , and show that such bubbles can excite several consecutive sound waves without the need to invoke periodic jet launching episodes .",
    "we do not deal with the propagation of sound waves and their properties .",
    "these seem to require more sophisticated treatment ( graham et al .",
    "we limit ourself to show that a proper treatment of bubble inflation can better explain the excitation of sound waves in the icm .",
    "the simulations were performed using the _ virginia hydrodynamics - i _ code ( vh-1 ; blondin et al . 1990 ; stevens et al . 1992 ) , as described in sternberg & soker ( 2008b ) . in this paper",
    "we mention only the important features of the code .",
    "the unperturbed icm temperature is set to @xmath6 .",
    "gravity is included , but radiative cooling is not included .",
    "we study a three - dimensional axisymmetric flow with a 2d grid ( referred to as 2.5d ) .",
    "we simulate half of the meridional plane using the two - dimensional version of the code in spherical coordinates .",
    "the symmetry axis of all plots shown in this paper is along the x ( horizontal ) axis .",
    "we run two cases . in the wide jets case ,",
    "the two opposite jets were injected at a radius of @xmath7 , with constant mass flux of @xmath8 per one jet , and a constant radial velocity of @xmath9 , inside a half opening angle of @xmath10 .",
    "the total power of the two jets is @xmath11 .",
    "the jets were active for a period of @xmath12 , from @xmath13 until @xmath14 .",
    "for more detail on the numerical code and the properties of the bubbles see sternberg & soker ( 2008b ) .    in the case of the precessing jets",
    "the two opposite jets were injected at a radius of @xmath7 with @xmath8 per one jet , and a constant radial velocity of @xmath9 ( the same parameters of the wide jets ) , but within a half opening angle of @xmath15 . in our axisymmetric code",
    "the jets are precessing very rapidly around the symmetry axis ( i.e. , in 3d we actually inject a torus ) .",
    "we vary the angle between the symmetry axis and the jets axis @xmath16 in a random way .",
    "namely , the jet axis has the same probability to take any direction within an angle of @xmath17 .",
    "this is done by changing @xmath16 periodically and taking @xmath18 to be constant .",
    "the precession period , i.e. , the time the jet returns to the same angle @xmath16 , is @xmath19 .",
    "the jet s interaction with the icm is similar to that of a wide jet with a half opening angle of @xmath20 .",
    "the jets were active for a duration of @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath14 .",
    "gravity was included as was in the wide jets case .",
    "in fig . [ fig : jeti ] we show the density and velocity map of the wide - jet - inflated bubble at @xmath23myr , and at @xmath14 when the jet is shut off .",
    "there are some flow structures which characterize the jet - inflated bubble that are not present when artificial bubbles are used ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) .",
    "most relevant for us are the following : ( 1 ) the bubble and the dense shell around it have radial momentum .",
    "in particular , the shell s front is relatively dense and has an outward velocity .",
    "this will form the ripple observed at the front edge of the bubbles in perseus .",
    "( 2 ) as the bubbles grow their shapes change .",
    "this relative motion of the bubble - icm boundary excites sound waves .",
    "( 3 ) there is a circular flow , a vortex , around the lowest density region in the bubble .",
    "this vortex and the back flow of the icm along the boundary of the bubble change the shape of the bubble , a processes leading to excitation of sound waves .",
    "we also note the back flow of the icm around the bubble , and that at early times the bubble expands supersonically , e.g. , an average mach number of @xmath24 between @xmath23myr and @xmath14 , and the shell is a weak shock . at later times the bubble moves subsonically .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we followed the response of the icm to the inflation of bubbles by jets .",
    "the inflation of a bubble by a jet results in vortices inside the bubble and a backflow of the icm around the bubble ( sternberg et al . 2007 ; sternberg & soker 2008a , b ) .",
    "both processes cause the bubble - icm to change shape with time and to become corrugated . in the case of a precessing jet ( section [ sec : precessing ] ) , the changes in the jet axis cause a more prominent change in the bubble - icm shape .",
    "this motion of the bubble - icm boundary sends shocks and sound waves into the icm .",
    "this effect can not be reproduced by artificial bubbles , i.e. , by numerically inserting spherical bubbles at off - center locations .",
    "our main result is that one episode of a bubble pair inflation can excite several sound waves along each radial direction .",
    "these form high - density arcs , the ripples .",
    "the front ripple is actually a weak shock .",
    "there is no need to introduce periodic ( or semi - periodic ) episodes of bubble inflation .",
    "nonetheless , multiple episodes will make more ripples , and make the ripple structure more complicated .",
    "this is the case in perseus , where the main central bubble pair was formed by jets that changed their direction and intensity ( dunn et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we also observe a dense arc at the bubble s front that is apparent part of the time .",
    "the dense arc is the excitation of a new sound wave at the compression phase .",
    "part of the time the region at the bubble s front is at the rarefaction phase , the wave trough , and no dense arc is observed there .",
    "our results can be incorporated into a broader scope . in a previous paper ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) we found",
    "that to follow the evolution of bubbles in the icm one must inflate them by jets , rather than introduce them artificially .",
    "the evolution of bubbles and their influence on the icm , e.g. , sound waves , is crucial for the deposition of heat from the central active galactic nuclei to the icm .",
    "our works show that in order to understand the heating of the icm one must properly inflate bubbles .",
    "we thank john blondin for his immense help with the numerical code .",
