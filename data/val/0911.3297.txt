    "the spin structure of the nucleon remains the essential problem of nonperturbative qcd and hadronic physics .",
    "one of its most significant manifestations is the so - called spin crisis or spin puzzle related to the surprisingly small fraction of proton polarization carried by quarks @xcite .",
    "this problem attracted attention to the peculiarities of the underlying qcd description of the nucleon spin , in particular , to the role of the gluonic anomaly ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the natural physical interpretation of these effects was the gluon ( circular ) polarization , while the experimental indications of its smallness may also point to a possible manifestation of the anomaly via the strangeness polarization @xcite .",
    "the key point is its consideration as a kind of heavy - quarks polarization @xcite due to the multiscale @xcite picture of the nucleon exploring the fact that strange quark mass is much ( as the squared ratios matter ) smaller than the nucleon one and , in turn , larger than higher - twist parameters .",
    "higher - twist parameters ( known also as the color polarizabilities ) are important ingredients of the nucleon spin structure .",
    "their extraction from experimental studies is relatively complicated as they are most pronounced at low momentum transfer @xmath10 .",
    "although in this region very accurate jefferson lab ( jlab ) data are now available , higher - twist contributions are shadowed by landau singularities of qcd coupling . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem may be solved by the use of singularity - free couplings which allowed a quite accurate extraction of higher twist ( ht ) and a fairly good description of data down to rather low @xmath10 .",
    "the object of investigation in @xcite was the difference of the lowest moments @xmath11 of proton and neutron structure functions @xmath12 , which corresponds to the renowned bjorken sum rule ( bsr ) @xcite . at finite @xmath4",
    "the moments @xmath11 are modified by higher order radiative corrections and higher - twist power corrections , as dictated by the operator product expansion ( ope )",
    ". such generalized ( @xmath4-dependent ) bsr became a convenient and renowned target ground for testing different possibilities of combining both the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd contributions in the low - energy domain ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the global higher twist analysis of the data on the spin - dependent proton structure function @xmath13 at relatively large @xmath14 , was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . while the @xmath15 term in the ope works at relatively high scales @xmath16 , higher - twist power corrections @xmath17 etc . ,",
    "start to play a significant role at lower scales , where the influence of the ghost singularities in the coefficient functions within the standard perturbation theory ( pt ) becomes more noticeable .",
    "it affects the results of extraction of the higher twists from the precise experimental data leading to unstable ope series and huge error bars @xcite .",
    "it seems natural that the weakening or elimination of the unphysical singularities of the qcd coupling would allow shifting the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) frontier to a lower energy scale and getting more exact information about the nonperturbative part of the process described by the higher - twist series .    as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the situation becomes better if one uses for a running coupling a more precise iterative solution of the renormalisation group ( rg ) equation in the form of the so - called denominator representation @xcite instead of the particle data group loop @xmath18 expansion @xcite , especially at the two - loop level . in this investigation , to avoid completely the unphysical singularities at @xmath19 we deal with the ghost - free analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) @xcite ( for a review on apt concepts and algorithms , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which recently proved to be an intriguing candidate for a quantitative description of light quarkonia spectra within the bethe - salpeter approach @xcite , and the so - called glueball - freezing model proposed recently by yu .",
    "a.  simonov in ref .",
    "@xcite ( below , sgf model ) to avoid the renormalon @xcite ambiguity in qcd .",
    "other versions of frozen @xmath20 models were developed earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite . as it will seen below that apt and sgf approaches",
    "predict very close couplings at @xmath21 , whereas they have different infrared - stable points at @xmath22 . consequently , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these models lead to very close perturbative parts of the bjorken sum @xmath23 . the higher - twist contributions turned out to be very close , too . here",
    ", we would like to discuss this point in more detail .    in the current paper",
    "we study the interplay between higher orders of the pqcd expansion and higher - twist contributions using the recent jlab data on the lowest moments of the spin - dependent proton and neutron structure functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the range @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "thus , we extend and generalize the analysis started in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering also the singlet channel involving the @xmath24 for the proton ( providing the most accurate data ) and the neutron structure functions separately .",
    "this allows , in particular , determining the singlet axial charge @xmath6 coming into both @xmath27 moments , which in the quark - parton model is identified with the total spin carried by quarks in the proton . for this purpose",
    ", we perform the global analysis of the jlab precise low - energy data on @xmath28 @xcite using the advantages of the apt and sgf model , and extract the singlet axial charge @xmath6 , as well as the coefficient @xmath29 of the @xmath15 subleading twist-4 term , which contains information on quark - gluon correlations in nucleons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the lowest moments analysis for the polarized structure functions @xmath30 in the framework of the conventional pt approach is performed . in sec . 3 , we dwell briefly on the apt , its ideas and the results of its application to @xmath31 . in sec . 4",
    ", we apply the formalism to the analysis of the low - energy data on the first moments @xmath31 and compare the results with the results of other researchers concerning the singlet axial constant @xmath6 and gluon polarization @xmath32 at low @xmath33 .",
    "section 5 contains discussion and some concluding remarks .",
    "the lowest moments of spin - dependent proton and neutron structure functions @xmath30 are defined as follows : @xmath35 with @xmath36 , the energy transfer @xmath37 , and the nucleon mass @xmath38 the upper limit includes the proton / neutron elastic contribution at @xmath39 .",
    "this contribution becomes essential if the ope is used to study the evolution of the integral in the moderate and low momentum transfer region @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is of special interest to analyze data with the elastic contribution excluded , since the low-@xmath4 behavior of `` inelastic '' contributions to their nonsinglet combination @xmath41 , i.e. bsr , is constrained by the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite , and one may investigate its continuation to a low scale @xcite .",
    "so below we study inelastic contributions @xmath42 using the corresponding low - energy jlab data @xcite .",
    "note that the influence of the `` elastic '' contribution is noticeable starting from the higher - twist @xmath43 term which is natural due to a decrease of the elastic contribution with growing @xmath4 @xcite .    at large @xmath4",
    "the moments @xmath27 are given by the ope series in powers of @xmath15 with the expansion coefficients related to nucleon matrix elements of operators of a definite twist ( defined as the dimension minus the spin of the operator ) , and coefficient functions in the form of pqcd series in @xmath44 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath45 the moments are dominated by the leading twist contribution , @xmath46 , which is given in terms of matrix elements of the twist-2 axial vector current , @xmath47 .",
    "this can be decomposed into flavor singlet and nonsinglet contributions .",
    "the total expression for the perturbative part of @xmath31 including the ht contributions reads @xmath48 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mu^{p , n}_{2i}(q^2)}{q^{2i-2}},\\label{pt - gam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the singlet and nonsinglet wilson coefficients , respectively , calculated as series in powers of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "these coefficient functions for @xmath52 active flavors in the scheme are @xmath53 the triplet and octet axial charges @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 @xcite , respectively , are extracted from weak decay matrix elements and are known from @xmath56-decay measurements . as for the singlet axial charge @xmath6 ,",
    "it is convenient to work with its rg invariant definition in the scheme @xmath57 , in which all the @xmath4 dependence is factorized into the definition of the wilson coefficient @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the proton and neutron spin sum rules ( ssrs ) , the singlet and octet contributions are canceled out , giving rise to more fundamental bsr @xmath59 which is analyzed here along with the proton ssr in more detail than in ref .",

    "note that the evolution of the higher - twist terms @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ pt - gam ] ) is still unknown . as a next step",
    "we discuss the possible influence of the @xmath7 evolution on our results .",
    "the @xmath4 evolution of the proton higher - twist term @xmath68 is assumed to be the same as the evolution of the nonsinglet twist @xmath62 .",
    "this may be justified by the relative smallness of the singlet higher - twist term .",
    "[ table1 ]    .current nlo fit results for the axial singlet charge @xmath6 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we already mentioned , the evolution of the @xmath68 is taken to be the same as for the nonsinglet term @xmath62 , allowing one to keep only one fitting parameter @xmath69 instead of two in the general case .",
    "we also tested that the singlet anomalous dimension instead of the nonsinglet one [ resulting in the same @xmath4 evolution of @xmath68 as that of @xmath70 leads to close fit results within error bars .",
    "figure  [ fig : a0-chi2-mu4 ] demonstrates the characteristic values of the proton data fits @xmath71 ( upper row ) and the twist-4 coefficient @xmath5 ( lower row ) as functions of @xmath6 at different values of @xmath72 ( numbers at the curves ) .",
    "one can see that at lower @xmath4 ( @xmath73 ) the apt description ( left panels ) turns out to be more precise and stable than that in the standard pt ( right panels ) .",
    "though we have taken the fitted values of @xmath6 and higher twists @xmath74 in the minima of each @xmath71 curve as best fits , the naive constraint @xmath75 ( dotted horizontal lines mark @xmath76 ) provides a quite wide spread in the allowable values of the fit parameters",
    ". however , it would be reasonable to take the spread between different minima as an optimistic error bar of our analysis .",
    "this gives us the following result : @xmath77 , which is consistent with the recent analysis by compass @xcite and hermes @xcite ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron ] , we show the best fit results for the less precise neutron @xmath78 data . again , the apt fit gives the ht values demonstrating a better convergence of the ope series , in contrast to the usual pt fit results .",
    "fits with apt and more precise denom pt couplings lead to a much smaller value of @xmath79 and more stable fitting curves than that with the pdg coupling .",
    "also the axial singlet charge @xmath6 extracted within apt from the neutron data turns out to be very close to the one extracted from more precise proton data ( see table  [ tab : prottot ] ) .    to obtain the genuine value of the twist-4 term @xmath80",
    ", we act in a similar way as for the bsr case in the previous subsection , namely , subtracting an extra @xmath81 term induced by the apt series @xmath82 e^{apt}_{s}(q^2)&=&e_{s}(\\alps=\\alps^{lo}(q^2))+ \\varkappa^{s}_4",

    "@xcite , showing up the consistence of the apt analysis with the usual pt one for the proton and neutron ssr @xmath11 data at @xmath89 . our result ( [ mu4_apt - p ] ) is also consistent with the previous extraction at higher energies in ref .",
    "@xcite within the error bars ( see also table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the best apt fit allows one to describe low - energy jlab data on @xmath11 at scales down to @xmath90 with only the first three terms of the ope series , unlike the usual pt case , where such fits happened to be impossible ( due to the ghost issue ) even for an increasing number of ht terms .",
    "this means that the lower bound of the pqcd applicability ( supported by power ht terms ) now may be shifted down to @xmath91 mev .",
    "however , it seems to be difficult to get a description in the region @xmath92 .",
    "this is not surprising , because the expansion in positive powers of @xmath4 and its matching @xcite with the ht expansion are relevant here . in this respect",
    ", the @xmath93 scale appears as a natural border between `` higher - twist '' and `` chiral '' nonperturbative physics .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltag ] , we show the scale dependence of the gluon polarization @xmath32 obtained in apt , pt , and the sgf model . in conventional pt",
    "the value of @xmath32 is small at the lower scale @xmath94 ( see ref .",
    "however , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : deltag ] , one may evolve @xmath32 starting from higher scales @xmath95 down to the deep infrared region and observe that the smallness of @xmath32 is a consequence of the landau singularities in @xmath51 . applying different ghost - free models we see that @xmath32 is much higher at @xmath96 than one predicted in the standard pt .",
    "the singlet axial charge @xmath6 is the essential element of the nucleon spin structure which is related to the average total quark polarization in the nucleon . in this paper",
    ", we systematically extracted this quantity from very accurate jlab data on the first moments of spin structure functions @xmath30 .",
    "these data were obtained at low @xmath4 region @xmath97 , and therefore , a special attention was paid to the qcd coupling in this domain .",
    "we demonstrated that the denominator form ( [ denom ] ) of the qcd coupling is more suitable at the low @xmath4 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : as-2l ] and [ fig : loop - sen ] ) .",
    "in particular , at the two - loop level it happens to be quite close to the exact numerical solution of the corresponding two - loop rg equation for @xmath98 .",
    "the performed analysis includes even lower @xmath99 and involves the qcd coupling which is free of landau singularities . for this purpose",
    "we used the apt @xcite and the soft glueball - freezing model @xcite for the infrared - finite qcd coupling @xmath51 .",
    "it was shown that the singularity - free apt and sgf qcd couplings are very close in the domain @xmath100 .",
    "one can argue that large order perturbative and nonperturbative contributions are mixed up , and the duality between them is expected ( see ref .",
    "we tested a separation of perturbative and nonperturbative physics and performed a systematic comparison of the extracted values of the higher - twist terms in different versions of perturbation theory .",
    "a kind of duality between higher orders of pt and ht terms is observed so that higher order terms absorb part of the ht contributions moving the pqcd frontier between the pt and ht contribution to lower @xmath10 values in both nonsinglet and singlet channels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dual ] ) . as expected , the value of @xmath6 changes substantially when coming from lo to nlo , whereas it is quite stable in higher - loop approximations .",
    "the perturbative contribution to the proton spin sum rule @xmath101 and to the bjorken sum rule @xmath102 in the apt approach and the sgf model is less than 5 % for @xmath103 .",
    "this explains the similarity of the extracted higher - twist parameters for these two modifications of qcd couplings .    in the apt approach",
    "the convergence of both the higher orders and ht series is much better . in both the nonsinglet and singlet case , while the twist-4 term happened to be larger in magnitude in the apt than in the conventional pt , the subsequent terms are essentially smaller and quickly decreasing ( as the apt absorbs some part of nonperturbative dynamics described by ht ) .",
    "this is the main reason for the shift of the pqcd frontier to lower @xmath10 values .",
    "a satisfactory description of the proton ssr and bsr data down to @xmath104 was achieved by taking the higher - twist and ( analytic ) higher order perturbative contributions into account simultaneously ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : bjtot ] and [ fig : prottot ] ) . the best accuracy for the extracted values of @xmath6 and higher - twist contributions @xmath74",
    "is achieved for the most precise proton ssr data while the analysis of the data on the neutron ssr shows the compatibility with the analysis of the bsr which is free from the singlet contribution .",
    "for the first time we considered the qcd evolution at low @xmath4 of both the leading twist @xmath6 and the higher - twist @xmath5 terms using the ( fractional ) analytic perturbation theory @xcite and also the related evolution of the average gluon polarization @xmath32 .",
    "account of this evolution , which is most important at low @xmath4 , improves the stability of the extracted parameters whose @xmath4 dependence diminishes ( see table  [ tab : prottot ] ) . as a result",
    ", we extract the value of the singlet axial charge @xmath105 .",
    "this value is very close to the corresponding compass @xmath106 @xcite and hermes @xmath106 @xcite results .",
    "the rg evolution of @xmath6 is related to the evolution of the average gluon polarization @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the results of the evolution of @xmath32 in the analytic perturbation theory and in the standard pt was compared ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : deltag ] ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath32 at low @xmath4 in apt is not so dramatic as in the standard pt case @xcite .    in a sense",
    ", it could be natural if the main reason for the significant shift of the pqcd frontier to lower @xmath4 scales was the disappearance of unphysical singularities in perturbative series .",
    "note that the data at very low @xmath99 are usually dropped from the analysis of @xmath6 and the higher - twist term in the standard pt analysis because of landau singularities . at the same time , the compatibility of our results for @xmath6 , extracted from the low energy jlab data with previous results @xcite demonstrates the universality of the nucleon spin structure at large and low @xmath4 scales .",
    "it will be very interesting to explore the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative physics against other low energy experimental data .",
