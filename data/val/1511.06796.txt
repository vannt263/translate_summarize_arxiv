    "two - dimensional materials  such as graphene@xcite , silicene@xcite , germanene@xcite , phosphorene@xcite , stanene@xcite , and ( semiconducting ) transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds)@xcite , just to mention the most ` popular ' in a growing list  have stimulated interest and excitement . on scientific grounds ,",
    "most of these materials exhibit novel topological properties linked , for example , to the quantum spin hall effect@xcite and superconductivity@xcite . from a more practical perspective",
    ", they promise to open the door to continued scaling of ` conventional ' field - effect transistors ( fets)@xcite and to a plethora of other nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications . from this perspective , most of the promise offered by these materials obviously hinges on a ` satisfactory ' mobility of the charge carriers , ` satisfactory ' meaning _ at least _ several hundreds @xmath1/vs to be competitive with si in digital logic applications .",
    "graphene satisfies and even largely exceeds this requirement .",
    "other materials , instead , so far have shown an electron mobility that is , at best , no more than satisfactory . in many cases , this is simply the result of yet immature material technology : defects , grain boundaries , charge impurities , interactions with the supporting substrate or gate insulators , all of these may be blamed . here ,",
    "however , we argue that there may be more to it . indeed , our main goal is to point out the existence of an _ intrinsic _ physical problem that arises theoretically : this problem is strictly linked to the thermodynamic instability of ideal two - dimensional crystals and it affects the electron mobility in materials in which electrons can be scattered by acoustic flexural modes via one - phonon processes , as illustrated schematically in fig .  [ fig : scattering ] . such scattering is possible in two - dimensional crystals that are not symmetric under reflections on the horizontal plane of the lattice .",
    "we shall refer to these crystals as being non-@xmath2-symmetric .    )",
    "symmetry , such as graphene or semiconducting tmds in the hexagonal phase , this scattering process is prohibited by symmetry , in materials without @xmath0-symmetry such as silicene or semiconducting tmds in the tetragonal phase , scattering with flexural modes is allowed .",
    "this scattering can be exceedingly strong since the out - of - plane ionic displacement diverges as @xmath3 at a small phonon momentum @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , instead of the ` usual ' in - plane behavior @xmath6 ) and the number of occupied phonon modes , governed by the bose - einstein distribution , diverges as well ( @xmath7).,width=302 ]    we should emphasize immediately that this problem has been already discussed at length in the past in the context of biological membranes , polymerized layers , and some inorganic surfaces@xcite .",
    "the problem has obviously attracted renewed attention with the advent of graphene@xcite .",
    "in particular , recent work has solved the problem of the diverging electron / two - phonon scattering processes in @xmath2-symmetric crystals@xcite , explaining the large electron mobility observed in free - standing graphene@xcite .",
    "this ` state - of - the - art ' will be mentioned again below . here , we discuss the serious additional problem that arises exclusively in non - graphene - like systems , namely , in non-@xmath2-symmetric two - dimensional crystals .",
    "since we will be forced to deal with divergences , our use of perturbation theory can only give qualitative hints , but compelling hints nevertheless .",
    "therefore , we will only be able to speculate about possible solutions , intentional or ` natural ' , of the problem , assuming they exist .",
    "our discussion will be restricted to two - dimensional lattices of the honeycomb type , _",
    "i.e. _ hexagonal and tetragonal crystals .",
    "we consider here two main issues with two - dimensional crystals : the parabolic nature of the dispersion of acoustic out - of - plane ( flexural ) modes ( za phonons ) and the degeneracy of the bands at the k / k@xmath8 symmetry point in hexagonal / tetragonal crystals with a dirac - like electron dispersion .",
    "consequences of the former issue are related to the well - known ` stability problem ' , as we have mentioned above . on the contrary , to our knowledge",
    "the effect of the latter in non-@xmath0-symmetric crystals has received so far little or no attention . + _ 1 .",
    "parabolic dispersion of the za phonons .",
    "_ the first issue originates from the well - known  and a bit controversial  theorem known as the _ mermin - wagner - hohenberg - coleman theorem_@xcite , although similar arguments had been raised earlier by peierls@xcite and landau@xcite",
    ". we shall simply refer to this theorem as the ` mermin - wagner ' theorem , for brevity .",
    "this theorem , which we shall briefly revisit below , states that _ infinite , ideal _ two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals are not stable : the thermal population of long - wavelength out - of - plane ( or ` flexural ' ) acoustic phonons diverges at any finite temperature .",
    "the theorem does not go as far as providing a quantitative estimate for the maximum size we may hope to obtain for a stable 2d crystal .",
    "but , probably , the ` wrinkles ' , defects , and finite grain size that we normally associate with samples of 2d crystals , are direct consequences of the mermin - wagner theorem , as also suggested by geim and novoselov@xcite .",
    "it may seem at first that this problem may affect the stability of the crystals , but that it should be unrelated to the carrier mobility . on the contrary",
    ", it is strongly connected to the electron - transport properties of non-@xmath0-symmetric systems in which electrons can interact with flexural phonons . indeed , the reason for the instability of ideal , infinite 2d crystals ultimately stems from the parabolic dispersion of the acoustic flexural modes , the za phonons .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of their 2d nature and it is the reason why their population diverges at long wavelength .    to see how in non-@xmath0-symmetric crystals the transport properties are affected by this ,",
    "consider a 2d crystal , an electron of wavevector @xmath9 , and calculate the rate at which it emits or absorbs an acoustic phonon using the usual elastic@xcite , high - temperature equipartition approximation@xcite : @xmath10 \\ ,    \\label{eq : intro}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the areal mass density of the crystal , @xmath12 is the acoustic ` deformation potential ' expressing the strength of the electron - phonon interaction , @xmath13 is the electron dispersion , @xmath14 is the phonon wavevector , and , finally , @xmath15 is the phonon dispersion .",
    "( we use upper - case symbols for 2d vectors . )",
    "it is immediately clear that the ` usual ' linear phonon dispersion involving the sound velocity @xmath16 , @xmath17 can be integrated straightforwardly .",
    "on the contrary , a parabolic dispersion @xmath18 results in a logarithmic singularity at small scattering angles @xmath19 , since the integrand behaves as @xmath3 .",
    "this divergence is directly connected to the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "physically , the diverging scattering rate represents an electron interacting with a diverging number of za phonons .",
    "two - dimensional crystals with a horizontal mirror plane ( that we shall assume is the plane @xmath20 , the @xmath21-plane ) are immune to this problem to first order ( in the atomic displacement ) : as a consequence of their @xmath2 symmetry , the ionic displacement associated with a za phonon is always perpendicular to the @xmath21-plane and the potential associated with the flexural displacement is odd with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , because each band is either even or odd with respect to @xmath2 , the product of the initial state , the potential due to the displacement and the final state is odd with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the electron - phonon matrix element , being the integral of an odd function , thus vanishes and intraband electronic transitions assisted by flexural modes ( za phonons or their optical counterpart , zo ) are forbidden .",
    "graphene and semiconducting tmds with horizontal mirror symmetry ( namely , those with the hexagonal crystal structure ) are thus spared from intra - band za phonon scattering to first order .",
    "the 300  k electron mobility in these symmetric systems ( such as free - standing graphene ) may be limited to a few @xmath22 by two - phonon processes@xcite ( still quite a large value , because the interaction is second - order in the ionic displacement , as symmetry demands the simultaneous emission or absorption of two phonons ) . however ,",
    "even these processes have been shown to be strongly weakened by the anharmonic coupling of the flexural modes to the in - plane modes .",
    "indeed , in these symmetric crystals , this coupling stiffens the crystal@xcite and removes the electron / za - phonon singularity at the dirac point@xcite .",
    "however , in crystals without a horizontal mirror plane , such as silicene , germanene , or semiconducting tmds with a tetragonal ( t ) or distorted - tetragonal ( t ) crystal structure , this protection against first - order , one - phonon scattering processes by flexural modes is absent and , as we shall briefly discuss below , the anharmonic coupling of the flexural modes to the in - plane modes does not eliminate the singularity and it is largely ineffective in boosting the mobility that is now controlled by one - phonon processes .",
    "these non-@xmath0 materials are therefore much more seriously affected by the diverging number of long - wavelength za phonons .",
    "dirac - like dispersion . _",
    "the second very important issue we consider is a problem that affects non-@xmath0-symmetric materials with a dirac - like electron dispersion : in these materials , we must face the additional problem of an increased strength of the electron / za - phonon coupling .",
    "this results from the degeneracy of the bands at the symmetry - point k , where back - scattering with flexural modes is orders of magnitudes stronger compared to scattering with other modes , as discussed in the next section .",
    "unless some long - wavelength cutoff is provided by other mechanisms ( damping of the za modes by a substrate and/or gate insulator , finite and small grain size , defects , wrinkles , and such ) , the expected mobility will be zero ` for all practical purposes ' .",
    "+ we are aware only of a few previous calculations of the electron mobility in silicene@xcite , germanene@xcite and transition - metal dichalcogenides with a tetragonal crystal structure ( _ i.e. _ , hfse@xmath23 , hfs@xmath23 , zrse@xmath23 , and zrs@xmath23 in ref .  ) . in ref .  , the divergent scattering rates were artificially ` regularized ' by approximating the parabolic dispersion of the za modes with a linear dispersion . even with these simplifications , li",
    "_ et al._@xcite found the za phonons to dominate the mobility , but the 300  k values reported are orders of magnitude larger than what we find here , thanks to the _ ad hoc _ regularization of the singularity .",
    "et al._@xcite and ye and co - workers@xcite have calculated the electron mobility in silicene and germanene , respectively , using an approximate expression that involves only the 2d in - plane elastic constant and deformation potentials",
    ". this amounts to neglecting the effect of the flexural modes and of the mermin - wagner theorem altogether .",
    "moreover , even when dealing with the interaction of electrons with in - plane phonons , only longitudinal acoustic phonons are considered ( via the use of the @xmath24 elastic constant ) and wavefunction - overlap effects are ignored . in so doing ,",
    "they have obtained an electron mobility at 300  k of @xmath25 @xmath1/vs for silicene , of @xmath26 @xmath1/vs for germanene .",
    "these values approach and even exceed the calculated mobility in graphene .",
    "experimental values for silicene@xcite are far less exciting , showing a field - effect electron mobility of about 80-to-100 @xmath1/vs .",
    "note that in these cases the 2d crystal was supported . the acoustic - phonon - limited electron mobility at 300  k in hfse@xmath23 , hfs@xmath23 , zrse@xmath23 , and zrs@xmath23 has been calculated to be as high as 3579 , 1833 , 2316 , and 1247 @xmath1/vs , respectively , in ref .",
    "however , these results have been obtained using the same model employed by shao _",
    "et al._@xcite and ye and co - workers@xcite , therefore ignoring in - plane transverse modes , wavefunction - overlap effects and , most important , the coupling of electrons with acoustic flexural modes in these 2d crystals with a non-@xmath0-symmetric tetragonal structure . finally , values ranging from 286 @xmath27/(vs ) ( hole mobility in fets@xcite ) to about 900 @xmath27/(vs ) ( electron mobility in quantum - well fets@xcite ) have been reported for the ( gapped ) phosphorene . however , whereas this crystal is not strictly @xmath0 symmetric , its space group is non - symmorphic and contains a glide plane with horizontal mirror symmetry .",
    "therefore , its point group contains the @xmath0 symmetry and the za / electron coupling is forbidden , much like in the case of graphene .",
    "all puckered 2d crystals of this structure are therefore immune from this problem .",
    "much more relevant to our study is the recent _ ab initio _ work by gunst _",
    "et al._@xcite : in this work , the electron / za - phonon interaction in silicene has been fully characterized , but it has been omitted when computing the electron mobility on the basis of the difficulty of accounting correctly for dielectric screening and speculations on possible effect of the substrate on the dispersion of the za phonons .",
    "we shall revisit the former issue in a footnote , the latter at length in the following .",
    "flexural modes have also been theoretically found to affect very strongly thermal transport in graphene@xcite ( although somewhat controversially@xcite ) and electronic transport in thin , free - standing quantum wells by bannov _ et al._@xcite and by glavin and co - workers@xcite .",
    "indeed , in these studies , the momentum and energy electron relaxation rates have been found to be enhanced in free - standing slabs because of the parabolic dispersion of the acoustic flexural modes , while supported films exhibit exponentially damped out - of - plane modes .",
    "their conclusions apply only at temperatures lower that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the thickness of the quantum well .",
    "however , for the 2d crystals we consider here , this temperature diverges , since phonon ` confinement ' along the out - of - plane direction is an ill - defined concept and we should consider the limit @xmath30 .    to estimate the value of the mobility , we compute the deformation potentials from first principles as described in ref .  .",
    "we use the vienna ab initio software package ( vasp ) @xcite to compute the wavefunction of the initial and final state and perform an inverse fourier transform to get the wavefunction in real space .",
    "we obtain the change in potential associated with a phonon displacement by calculating the potential for a small displacement of each atom along each cartesian direction and subsequently multiplying it by the polarization vector .",
    "phonon energies and polarization vectors are calculated using a post - processing package@xcite .",
    "the result of this calculation is a deformation potential , @xmath31 , whereas the total electron - phonon interaction requires the multiplication with a factor measuring the ionic displacement @xmath32 of a mode of frequency @xmath33 , as well as the bose - einstein distribution @xmath34.@xcite    we proceed as follows : we consider first the electron / za - phonon coupling in 2d crystals .",
    "we then review the mermin - wagner theorem and provide quantitative estimates for the room - temperature electron mobility in silicene .",
    "we conclude by speculating on the nature of a long - wavelength cutoff that may result in an increased electron mobility .",
    "our main conclusion can be summarized as follows : ideal , free - standing 2d crystals with a broken @xmath0 symmetry should exhibit an extremely low electron mobility .",
    "deviations from this conclusion would suggest the existence of some yet - to - be - determined mechanism able to damp the acoustic flexural modes .",
    "to investigate the nature of the interaction with flexural modes in materials with a dirac cone , we first resort to a simple tight - binding model and then proceed by applying the rigid - ion approximation@xcite . + _ 1",
    ". tight binding model .",
    "_ in the simplest tight - binding model , the basis consists of two orbitals with their respective origin at each of the two atoms a and b in each unit cell . for the wavefunctions composed of these orbitals to be compatible with the crystal symmetry , the orbitals must have a rotation axis perpendicular to the @xmath21-plane and the orbitals at a and b must be each others inversion image . in the absence of a @xmath0-symmetry , the orbitals need",
    "not have a horizontal mirror symmetry and will resemble an sp@xmath35 orbital rather than a p@xmath36 orbital .",
    "the electronic tight - binding hamiltonian has the same form as for graphene , @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 s are the pauli matrices , @xmath39 is the fermi velocity , and the 2d wavevector @xmath40 is measured from the k symmetry point ) and has eigenvalues @xmath41 and pseudospin eigenvectors @xmath42/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .    however , considering a rigid out - of - plane displacement of the potential @xmath43 associated with long - wavelength flexural modes ,",
    "a non - vanishing matrix element @xmath44 is obtained .",
    "( in the notation used below , @xmath45 for emission ( + ) and absorption ( - ) processes . )",
    "because of inversion symmetry , @xmath46 . therefore , in the tight - binding basis , the electron - phonon hamiltonian for the za phonons , @xmath47 , is diagonal with elements @xmath48 and @xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "the matrix element between an initial state @xmath50/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and a final state @xmath51/\\sqrt{2}$ ] is @xmath52 whose magnitude is @xmath53 .",
    "now , the atomic displacement , and consequently the magnitude of the potential @xmath54 , increases as @xmath55 decreases .",
    "so when the initial and final states approach each other at the k symmetry - point in reciprocal space , @xmath56 and @xmath55 decrease and the coupling of the electron - phonon interaction diverges .",
    "this is contrary to the ` usual ' acoustic phonon scattering where a decrease of the deformation potential @xmath57 counteracts the increase in displacement and the increase in occupation due to the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the result is that the electron - phonon matrix element @xmath58 remains constant as the initial and final state approach each other .",
    "the absence of a vanishing interaction can also be understood from a group - theoretical point of view .",
    "first of all , time - reversal symmetry combined with inversion symmetry map each point in the brillouin zone onto itself . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling and degeneracy , this ensures that the periodic part of the bloch waves @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , acoustic displacements are odd under inversion and therefore , the electron - phonon matrix elements @xmath60 , being the integral of a function which is odd with respect to inversion , vanish at each point in the brillouin zone where bands are non - degenerate , but are nonzero at the k - point , where bands _ are _ degenerate .",
    "furthermore , the k - point does not have inversion symmetry but has trivial symmetry ( e ) , a 3-fold rotation symmetry ( 2c@xmath61 ) and 3 vertical mirror planes ( 3@xmath62 ) which are described by the @xmath63 point group .",
    "@xmath63 is isomorphic to the dihedral group which is the smallest non - abelian group and therefore also the smallest group which has a two - dimensional irreducible representation ( e ) , needed for the dirac cone , next to the trivial representation ( @xmath64 ) and an odd representation ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the out - of - plane displacements associated with the flexural modes transform onto themselves under all 6 symmetry operations of @xmath63 , they are represented by the trivial representation @xmath64 which offers no symmetry protection .",
    "therefore the interaction of electrons with flexural phonons at the dirac - cone is not prohibited by the time - reversal / inversion symmetry , because the states are degenerate ; nor it is prohibited by the symmetry of the out - of - plane displacements , since the latter are represented by the trivial representation .",
    "this results in strong electron - phonon scattering and so in a reduced carrier mobility + _ 2 .",
    "rigid - ion approximation .",

    "( [ eq : hep ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : acoustic ] ) and ( [ eq : optical ] ) correspond to the well - known fact that at small @xmath4 , the acoustic ` deformation potential ' , @xmath31 ( the quantity given by eq .",

    ".    therefore , non @xmath0-symmetric materials with an energy gap  and , so , with a parabolic electron dispersion  are not subject to the large coupling with the za modes , since the bottom of the conduction band is non - degenerate .",

    "in the previous section , we considered the behavior of the deformation potential due to flexural modes in dirac materials but , as discussed in the introduction , scattering rates diverge in all two - dimensional materials , behavior that is related to the mermin - wagner theorem .    a rigorous formulation of this theorem has been given by coleman in a field - theoretical context@xcite : _ spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry is forbidden in @xmath113 2 dimensions , because the correlation of the corresponding ( goldstone ) bosons would diverge .",
    "_ in our context , this implies that breaking the continuous translational and rotational symmetries of a homogeneous 2d system required to form a crystal ( that possesses only discrete translational and rotational point - group symmetries ) , results in the divergence of the thermal population of za phonons .",

    "the problem  for which we can offer no solution , only speculations  is to determine whether the same cutoff that allows the stability of a 2d sample of finite size is also effective in yielding a technologically useful electron mobility .",
    "several cutoffs may be invoked .",

    "[ fig : za - mobility ] and [ fig : za - mobility_ge ] . at the electron density corresponding to the fermi energy shown in those figures , cutoff wavelengths of about 100",
    "nm boost the mobility to excellent values .",
    "however , samples used in devices at present have a finite size of several hundreds of nanometers or even tens of micrometers . looking at fig .  [",
    "fig : za - mobility ] , these cutoffs are not effective in raising the mobility to reasonably large values .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the finite size of the samples usually grown ( 1-to-10 @xmath151 m for tmds@xcite ) or the correlation - length of the roughness and ` wrinkles ' usually observed experimentally ( also of the order of micrometers in most two - dimensional crystals@xcite ) , are sufficient to result in a technologically useful carrier mobility . even in silicene and germanene ,",
    "grown with a relatively immature technology , grain sizes exceeding several hundreds of nanometers are routinely achieved ( see , for example , ref .",
    "for silicene on ag(111 ) ) .",
    "a more likely argument originates from what we have mentioned above and discussed at length in the literature in the context of suspended graphene : a ` natural ' cutoff has been shown to arise from the coupling of the flexural modes to the in - plane modes@xcite : these are essentially strain waves that stiffen the flexural modes , thus stabilizing membranes@xcite and 2d crystals@xcite .",
    "mariani and von oppen@xcite have shown that this coupling changes the parabolic dispersion of the za phonons , yielding a non - singular behavior @xmath182 for wavevectors @xmath4 much smaller that a cutoff @xmath183 ( expressed in our notation)@xcite . as we mentioned above , in @xmath0-symmetric crystals , this",
    "coupling stabilizes the structure@xcite and reduces significantly the strength of the electron / two - phonon interactions at the dirac point by eliminating the singularity@xcite .",
    "this depends crucially on several factors : first , the vanishing of the deformation potential at small @xmath4 in these mirror - symmetric materials reduces the severity of the long - wavelength singularity . as we have already remarked , in non-@xmath0-symmetric materials with a dirac electron dispersion , the deformation potential diverges as the initial and final states approach the k point .",
    "therefore , although the singularity is weakened by this ` stiffening ' , it still persists in non - symmetric crystals . not so in a symmetric material like graphene , for example",
    "second , even ignoring ` cutoffs ' of any type , the strong effect of this stiffening in , say , graphene , depends on the fact that a renormalization of the dispersion of the acoustic flexural modes ( such as @xmath184 instead of @xmath185 , as in ref .  , or even @xmath186 , as in ref .",
    ", with @xmath187 0.7 - 0.8 ) regularizes much more effectively weaker two - phonon processes , the only ones allowed in graphene , than one - phonon processes , allowed in the non-@xmath0-symmetric materials of interest here . finally , in ` heavier ' materials , such as silicene and especially germanene , the in - plane modes are softer than in graphene .",
    "therefore , the effect of the anharmonic coupling is smaller than in graphene .",
    "for example , because of the smaller sound velocities , this coupling will result in an anharmonic cutoff @xmath120 of about 3 nm and 2 nm in silicene and germanene respectively .",
    "this is still not enough to boost the mobility above 0.1 cm / vs , as shown by the curves labeled ` @xmath144 = 3/2 ' in figs .",
    "[ fig : za - mobility ] and [ fig : za - mobility_ge ] . on a related note , tensile strain in supported layers should not be expected to provide any stronger cutoff : van der waals interactions are likely to be too weak , whereas chemical bonding with the supporting substrate would alter the electronic structure of the layer so much as to yield a totally different structure .",
    "another plausible argument is based on the observation that in very small samples the material may exhibit a band gap and , so , a parabolic electron dispersion .",
    "this may result from dopants , a strong spin - orbit interaction , or vertical electric fields , for example .",
    "however , even in this case one would not expect a satisfactory carrier mobility , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : za - mobility ] .",
    "perhaps the most important observation relies on the fact that most 2d samples used to fabricate field - effect transistors , such as the silicene fet of ref .",
    ", are ` clamped ' by a supporting substrate and a gate insulator .",
    "this may result in a damping of long - wavelength za phonons or even in a significant stiffening of their dispersion , as the crystal would not be free to exhibit the same strong out - of - plane oscillations as in the free - standing case .",
    "effects of this type have been studied by ong and pop using a continuum model@xcite .",
    "they have shown that , in a single - layer graphene supported by sio@xmath23 , if one could somehow strengthen the interaction between the graphene sheet and the substrate ( presumable by controlling in morphology of the interface ) , this would cause the za phonons to exhibit a linear dispersion as a result of the hybridization of the graphene flexural models with the rayleigh waves of the substrate .",
    "being interested in thermal transport , they conclude that this enhanced coupling with the substrate would result in an enhanced velocity of the hybrid za - rayleigh modes and in an enhanced thermal conductivity .",
    "however , obviously such a linearization of the dispersion of the acoustic flexural modes in non-@xmath0-symmetric crystals would have dramatic effects on electronic transport as well .",
    "unfortunately , even a linear za - phonon dispersion does not seem to boost the mobility to technologically useful values , as seen in the curves labeled ` @xmath144 = 1 ' in figs .",
    "[ fig : za - mobility ] and [ fig : za - mobility_ge ] .    ong and",
    "pop s arguments are suggestive but only speculative , since a linearization of the za - phonon dispersion requires a graphene - substrate coupling at least one order of magnitude stronger than what is the expected from van der waals forces .",

    "et al._@xcite and has been shown by glavin _",
    "et al._@xcite to be an important effect in the different context of confined phonons in thin quantum wells .",
    "in the same spirit of ong and pop s arguments@xcite , here we argue that any such ` clamping ' provided by the supporting substrate and/or gate insulator sufficient to limit the amplitude of the out - of - plane ionic displacement to much less than 1% of the lattice constant ( probably requiring a coupling stronger than a simple van der waals interaction ) may be sufficient to boost significantly the carrier mobility .    , as a function of the maximum allowed out - of - plane displacement @xmath188 , expressed in units of the lattice constant @xmath158.,width=302 ]    in order to obtain a semi - quantitative idea of this last observation , we consider the thermal expectation value of the out - of - plane ionic displacement due to a population of thermally excited za phonons .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] .",
    "comparing this figure with fig .",
    "[ fig : za - mobility ] , we see that for silicene , using @xmath158 = 0.384  nm , an electron mobility of about 100 @xmath1/vs ( as reported in ref .  ) , is obtained only demanding a maximum out - of - plane displacement much smaller than 1% of the lattice constant .",
    "this seems a very small displacement , requiring extremely stiff substrate and gate - insulator materials .",
    "however , it is comparable to the thermal ionic displacement in bulk si at 300  k. note that also the in - plane ta and la phonons cause a diverging ionic displacement , although in this case the divergence is less severe ( logarithmic , as can be seen by inserting a linear phonon dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : displacement ] ) ) , and a more relaxed cutoff of about 200  nm is sufficient to restrict it to 1 - 3% of the lattice constant .",
    "finally , note that the effect of the spin - orbit interaction in weakening the coupling of the electron / za - phonon by lifting the degeneracy at the k symmetry point may be significant in germanene , less so in silicene .",
    "ironically , an extremely low electron mobility is advantageous in applications exploiting the ballistic electron conduction in the edge states of nanoribbons of 2d topological insulators , such as iodostannanane@xcite . in these proposed devices , the on - state",
    "current is obtained at carrier densities ( and fermi levels ) small enough to suppress scattering between the edge states in intra - edge which back - scattering is topologically - protected . in the off state ,",
    "the high fermi energy enhances the overlap between wavefunctions in opposite edges , thus boosting the inter - edge matrix elements and the associated strong inter - edge back scattering reducing the current by 3-to-4 orders of magnitude .",

    "finally , the extremely strong coupling between electrons and za phonons in the absence of any cutoff hints at a failure of perturbation theory . a correct treatment of the problem would require the renormalization of electron dispersion , accounting for the formation of acoustic polarons",
    ". however , the strength of the coupling makes it very hard to perform such a calculation beyond perturbation theory .",
    "we expand these considerations in appendix  [ sec : renormalization ] .",
    "we have shown that ideal , free - standing , infinite 2d crystals lacking @xmath0 symmetry exhibit a very poor electron mobility , because of the large number of thermally excited flexural ( za ) acoustic phonons .",
    "this is directly related to the mermin - wagner - hohenberg - coleman theorem . furthermore ,",
    "2d crystals without @xmath0 symmetry that also exhibit a dirac - like electron dispersion at the symmetry point k suffer from an enhanced electron / za - phonon coupling , as a consequence of the degeneracy of the bands at k. differently from what is known for @xmath0-symmetric crystals like graphene , we have speculated that , if a long - wavelength cutoff is present ( finite grain size , wrinkle correlation length ) , or if an anharmonic stiffening of the acoustic flexural modes arises so the mermin - wagner theorem is circumvented and the crystals is stable , then this cutoff - wavelength is likely to be too large ( or the stiffening too weak ) to result in a significantly larger electron mobility .",
    "other cutoffs  such as clamping of the 2d layer by a supporting substrate and/or gate - insulator or phonon stiffening by the clamping layers  must be present in order to obtain a satisfactory carrier mobility .    as we stated in the introduction ,",
    "our goal is to point out the existence of this mobility / za - phonons problem . in the same spirit of the mermin - wagner theorem ,",
    "we have shown how this problem arises , but we can not provide any conclusive answer to the question of how to solve the problem , or even whether solutions are naturally provided by the non - ideality of the 2d crystals we are interested in .    this work has been supported by a nanoelectronics research initiative / south west academy of nanoelectronics ( nri / swan ) grant .",
    "the authors also thank robert m. wallace for constructive discussions and for having critically read the manuscript .",
    "as stated in the main text , the strong coupling between electrons and za - phonons in 2d crystals with broken @xmath0 symmetry renders perturbation theory invalid . since electrons and za - phonons are",

    "we have verified directly  with cumbersome calculations we do not report here  that the 300  k za - phonon - limited electron mobility remains essentially unchanged with respect to the unscreened case .",
    "the origin of the weak role played by screening is mainly due to the weak effect of screening in dirac materials ( because of the high thermal velocity , @xmath39 ) and to the fact that the large thermal occupation of long - wavelength acoustic flexural modes ( effect that largely controls the electron mobility ) is unaffected by screening .",
    "therefore , the effective scattering potential is only marginally weakened : for a two - dimensional electron gas , the longitudinal dielectric function in the static limit has the form @xmath210 , where @xmath211 for a gapped / parabolic materials , and @xmath212 for dirac - like materials ( see the static limit of the expression given by b.  wunsch , t.  stauber , f.  sols , and f.  guinea , new j. phys .",

    "therefore , dielectric screening reduces the @xmath3 ( zero temperature ) or @xmath214 ( finite temperature ) long - wavelength singularity entering the expression for the matrix elements of the unscreened electron / za - phonon interaction potential to a non - singular behavior @xmath215 ( zero temperature ) or to a marginally less severe divergence @xmath216 $ ] ( nonzero temperature ) . in either case",
    ", the singularity is still present and dielectric screening mitigates the problem only marginally , suppressing the singularity only in the special case of zero temperature .",
    "we have also verified numerically that the effect of dielectric screening remains extremely small also for a stiffened za - phonon dispersion of the form we have considered , @xmath217 with @xmath144 = 1 and 3/2 . we should also note that dielectric - screening effects are already partially included in the intrinsic case ( _ i.e. _ , no free carriers ) in our calculation of the matrix elements ( deformation potentials ) based on density functional theory . the complication caused by the ` partial screening ' has led gunst and co - workers@xcite to bypass the problem and omit the electron / za - phonon interaction in their mobility calculations .",
