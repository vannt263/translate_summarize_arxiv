    "3d - hst is an hst treasury program executed in cycles 18 and 19 .",
    "the survey uses the acs and wfc3 grisms , providing slitless spectroscopy for all objects in the fields of these instruments .",
    "the primary and most innovative aspect of the survey is 2-orbit depth wfc3/g141 spectroscopy , covering the wavelength range @xmath4 m ",
    "1.65@xmath5 m .",
    "owing to the low sky background from space and the excellent sensitivity of wfc3 we reach a point - source continuum depth of @xmath6 at @xmath7 in 2 orbits .",
    "in addition to the g141 grism data the 3d - hst data comprise direct wfc3 images in the @xmath8 filter , parallel acs g800l grism exposures , and direct images in the acs @xmath9 filter .",
    "the survey fields are four of the fields of the candels multi - cycle treasury program : goods - south , uds , aegis , and cosmos . the fifth candels field , goods - north ,",
    "was observed by program go-11600 ( pi : weiner ) in cycle 17 to the same 2-orbit g141 depth as 3d - hst ( but without parallel acs grism data ) .",
    "we have included these goods - north data in our analysis .",
    "candels is primarily an imaging survey , providing @xmath10 and @xmath11 data at two different depths over the five fields .",
    "the 3d - hst grism data cover approximately 80% of the area of the candels fields , and form a spectroscopic complement to the candels imaging .",
    "the reduction , analysis , and interpretation of the slitless spectroscopy is not straightforward .",
    "the spectra of neighboring objects can overlap , which means a full 2d model of all spectra needs to be constructed and subtracted prior to analyzing the object of interest .",
    "furthermore , the `` psf '' of the grism spectra is effectively the ( wavelength - dependent ) morphology of the galaxy , complicating the fitting procedure .",
    "stsci provides software to analyze grism spectra but this is not optimized for faint - object spectroscopy ; we therefore developed fully independent , custom packages that enable optimal modeling and fitting of interlaced 2d spectra .",
    "we find that these tools work very well , even on the deepest ( 17-orbit ) grism data that are currently available ( see below ) .",
    "a further complication is that the grism spectra are often difficult to interpret without information from other wavelengths , as correct identification of faint emission lines usually requires some prior information on the likely redshifts of the objects",
    ". data at other wavelengths are also crucial for measuring stellar masses , rest - frame colors , star formation rates , and other parameters . with these goals in mind",
    "we have created photometric catalogs in the 3d - hst fields , as a first and necessary step to interpret the grism spectra .",
    "we are providing the g141 grism spectra in the only region of the survey which was observed multiple times : the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "we have used this field to test our fitting procedures and to extract and analyze the deepest near - ir spectra of faint galaxies currently available .",
    "the g141 spectra are based on a combination of 8 orbits of 3d - hst data and 9 orbits of candels supernova follow - up data .",
    "an analysis of the 17-orbit spectrum of a candidate @xmath12 galaxy in this field was presented in brammer et al.(2013 ) .",
    "we provide @xmath0 spectra and redshifts over the @xmath13 udf .",
    "this density of @xmath14 spectra per arcmin@xmath15 far exceeds what has been achieved in any other survey or can reasonably be done from the ground .      as part of our commitment to release all ancillary data used in the 3d - hst program we are providing our reduced wfc3 mosaics of all five 3d - hst / candels fields as part of data release v3.0 .",
    "the mosaics include the deep and wide @xmath16 data obtained as part of the candels program , the 3d - hst @xmath8 imaging , and the early release science observations ( and udf flanking fields ) in goods - south .",
    "the candels project has also released several of the imaging mosaics .",
    "our reduction uses the same tangent point and pixel scale as candels , which means 3d - hst and candels objects can be trivially matched and compared .",
    "we are preparing to release our photometric catalogs in these five fields , including derived photometric redshifts and stellar population parameters . the catalog release ( v3.1 )",
    "will be accompanied by a paper describing the reduction of the mosaics and the making of the catalogs ( skelton et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "information on the 3d - hst survey , as well as links to the data release , publications , pointing layout , and other information can be obtained from the 3d - hst website :          we have created several tools to explore the data release . for the ultra deep field we provide an html table with image thumbnails and spectra , which can be ordered according to i d , magnitude or redshift .",
    "an interactive image browser displays grism redshifts on udf objects and allows users to scroll around the field using a google maps - like interface .",
    "clicking on an object brings up the html table with the object at the top .",
