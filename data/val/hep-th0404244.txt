    "the dilaton corresponds to a time dependent gauge coupling in the boundary field theory .",
    "this suggests non - constant boundary conditions for the dilaton may be physically interesting . on the field theory side",
    "non - constant boundary conditions imply we no longer have time translation symmetry , energy conservation , conformal symmetry ( the gauge coupling sets a scale ) , or supersymmetry ( @xmath0 and since we have no time translation symmetry we have no superalgebra either ) .",

    "would produce a rather severe response in the bulk .",
    "ads has an infinite volume and area near the boundary and hence it seems likely even a finite change in the boundary conditions would send infinite energy into the bulk .",
    "since the field is massless and ads is conformally flat it seems likely the disturbance would be on the light cone .",
    "then one might expect a null singularity which converges to a point at the origin .",
    "on the other hand , the boundary field theory seems perfectly well behaved and one would expect finite changes in the dilaton boundary value would lead to finite energy states ( e.g. scattered waves , black holes ) in the bulk .",
    "we will see the second is true .",
    "the fact that we only get a finite reaction suggests this approach might lead to a full quantum description of matter dynamically collapsing to form a black hole  a still unrealized goal .",
    "it is also interesting to consider what happens if one sends the gauge coupling in the boundary theory to zero .",
    "while the gauge theory becomes free the dilaton boundary value gets sent to minus infinity and it seems very unlikely one would get a finite response in the bulk . perhaps the simplest possibilty is a big crunch .",

    "analytic continuation between euclidean and lorentzian ads turns out to be significantly more subtle than is usually assumed and in particular i will discuss the failure of a sensible analytic continuation of the solution to laplace s equation in either direction .",
    "i present a generic mode sum formalism for solving the lorentzian problem and then specialize to massless fields in ads and find several explicit solutions .",

    "this is not , of course , to say the continuation of all integrals and non - elementary functions is ill defined , but one should not blindly continue integral expressions or formalism .",

    "using poincar coordinates is potentially quite problematic because of the coordinate horizon ; it s not entirely clear how to define the analog of a regular solution since the usual bessel function solutions ( including the part usually identified as the normalizable mode ) oscillate with unbounded magnitude near the horizon .",
    "i ll stick to global coordinates .",
    "the position space solution , if it could be found , might be simpler although in practice even the witten euclidean position space solution tends to be technically hard to work with analytically",
    ". one can show with a bit of uninspiring algebra that the solution in the lorentzian case that one might expect  some function with delta function support on the light cone  actually is not a solution except in @xmath66 .",
    "i will be content here with a mode sum solution .",
    "first i will describe some general formalism for any spherically symmetric solution ( not just massless fields in ads ) if one has a complete set of mode solutions @xmath67 and seeks a solution subject to boundary conditions on a surface at @xmath68 . for massless fields one may safely impose boundary conditions at infinity , although for the massive case one needs ( apparently ) to impose a cutoff and put boundary conditions at some finite radius .",
    "it is again straightforward to extend the formalism to the non - spherically symmetric case .",
    "the advertised solution is @xmath69 one can tell this is right as follows : @xmath70 as required and @xmath71 i.e. @xmath72 is just a superposition of mode solutions and hence a solution .",
    "generically there are poles at frequencies where @xmath73 , i.e. the frequencies of the normalizable modes .",
    "i will only be concerned here with massless fields , although i believe this is a sensible definition of normalizable modes for theories with a cutoff .",
    "then i distort @xmath74 for @xmath75 a smooth function which goes to a nonzero constant in the neighborhood of each pole and is small compared to any relevant scale .",
    "then , @xmath76 note i ve been careful to preserve the pole structure of the integrand . assuming @xmath77 has at most a countable set of zeroes @xmath78 ( this is certainly true for ads ) and defining @xmath79 @xmath80 where the poles are now at @xmath81 . note then @xmath72 breaks up into an advanced and retarded piece and we have a very natural way to select the desired propagator from among this countably infinite set  namely only the propagator with each pole moved down is casual",
    "this is , of course , the retarded propagator .",
    "returning to the case of massless fields in ads , for @xmath25  @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "now that we have a lorentzian solution the reader might wonder , despite the previous section , whether there is a sensible analtic continuation for any pole prescription .",
    "the short answer is apparently no .",
    "consider rotating the contour by angle @xmath85 in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction . then define the euclidean time @xmath86 where the upper and lower signs refer to the counterclockwise and clockwise directions respectively .",
    "we immediately get a divergence unless we take : @xmath87    where @xmath88i.e . a feynman prescription .",
    "once we rotate the contour by angle @xmath89 can use the hypergeometric function generating function(@xcite ) to do the infinite sum with the result : @xmath90 the fractional power means we again have a branch cut to worry about . specifically as we change @xmath91 the contents of the parenthesis in the denominator in each of the above terms  a complex number even for real @xmath91goes through this branch cut . working out the details",
    "one finds for each integral given any y within the range @xmath92 and any point on the branch cut , there is a countably infinite set of rotation angles @xmath93 between 0 and @xmath94 and associated times @xmath95 when the expression in the denominator moves through the branch cut at that point .",
    "there is a similiar , albeit slightly more complicated , story for @xmath96 .",
    "the above is , however , sufficient to show the failure of the continuation .",
    "now let us examine some specific solutions .",
    "if one takes @xmath97 ( real(a ) @xmath98 @xmath99 ) it is possible to explicitly do the sum and integral in ( [ ads5retarded ] ) with the result @xmath100 which also may be written with a @xmath101 as @xmath102 there are several points to note here . for",
    "@xmath103 = 0 we find for @xmath104 = c , where c is some constant , @xmath72 = c. of course , this had to be .",
    "we also recover the mode solutions for real @xmath63 . as @xmath105 for n @xmath106",
    "one is forcing a mode to oscillate which approaches zero near the boundary and hence gets an arbitrarily large response in the bulk .    upon first examination one notices ( [ exponeqn2 ] )",
    "is factorized into time dependent and spatial dependent pieces and hence might wonder whether this solution is in fact retarded .",

    "we do in fact have retardation ; figures  [ figexp1 ]  -  [ figexp12 ]   plot solutions with @xmath108 for real @xmath103 and @xmath109 .",
    "if we change the boundary conditions much more slowly than the ads time scale  set to 1 here  the situation is quasi - static and the bulk solution is nearly homogeneous . if we change the boundary conditions much faster than the ads time scale the field near the boundary changes faster than signals can travel to points near the origin and we get a very inhomogeneous solution .",

    "however , relatively recently an asymptotic series for the relevant hypergeometric function for @xmath110 has been given in terms of bessel functions  @xcite .",
    "the bessel functions can then be expanded in the usual asymptotic series provided one is content to confine one s attention to points a bit away from the origin ( here i will get approximations reliable for y @xmath111 ) . then provided the integral in ( [ ads5retarded ] )",

    "the gauge theory is apparently well behaved through the transition and so it should be possible to transmit information through at least this kind of collapse . for the cases above after the divergence the dilaton returns to a finite value and at least this author thinks it likely one would have a sensible spacetime on the other side .",
    "definitive statements will require a better understanding of the ads - ft dictionary",
    ".    for small black holes obtaining analytic results seems nontrivial . in particular , the taylor series one would write for small black holes for ( [ bhexist ] ) does nt converge quickly enough to be useful .",
    "however , it is hopefully clear from the form of ( [ bhexist ] ) and by the plotted examples that by choosing the parameters in @xmath104 we can determine the size of the black hole we make .",
    "the spherically symmetric collapse of matter to form small black holes has been well studied numerically with a line of work started by matthew choptuik  @xcite .",
    "these studies start with initial conditions on a spacelike slice but one would expect , especially for boundary conditions which change much faster than the ads timescale , that one would quickly produce conditions very similiar to that work s initial conditions and hence reach a similiar conclusion .",
    "in particular , the naked singularity found in that work should be resolved by string theory since we have an apparently perfectly well behaved dual quantum field theory .",
    "as mentioned before the bulk calculations above are not expected to be qualitatively right because i have not included backreaction . on this point",
    "i would like to solicit the attention of numerical relativists . in terms of more basic theoretical issues",
    ", one needs a proper definition of asymptotically ads and energy in the case where one has energy flowing through the boundary .",
    "the usual references  @xcite on this issue assume the energy momentum tensor falls off at infinity faster than one finds in the cases i ve discussed .",
    "it remains an open question as to how often subtleties such as the ones described above prevent a sensible analytic continuation .",
    "virtually all of the work done on string theory in ads and ads / cft in particular has been done in the euclidean signature and it would be interesting to know how many more suprises await those examining the lorentzian case .",
    "regardless , one has from the observations here a whole new ads - ft dictionary to work out .",
    "if this could be done one would almost certainly have many interesting things to say about matter collapsing to form black holes , singularity resolution , and possibly a cosmological bounce . on the other hand , finding",
    "even the standard ads - cft dictionary has proven to be a nontrivial task .",
    "although not the focus of this paper , using the bulk to study the field theory might also prove interesting ; one has a way of at least numerically studying a strongly coupled , non - conformal , non - supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "one might also wonder whether one could find a scattering matrix formalism for the dual field theory in the case where one has a time dependent ( although perhaps very slowly varying ) gauge coupling .",
    "perturbing boundary conditions provides a rather direct link between the gauge and bulk theories and if we are clever and steadfast enough it may lead to some very interesting physics .",
