    "a 3-d @xmath1 quantum spin hall insulator  @xcite is defined to be accompanied by the integer number of surface conducting channels , each of which is described by the 2 + 1 massless dirac fermion , i.e. helical surface state .",
    "the stability of each helical surface state is protected by the kramers degeneracy at the time - reversal ( @xmath2- ) symmetric ( surface ) crystal momentum .",
    "the associated spin is directed within the @xmath3 plane , and rotates odd - number of times when the surface crystal momentum rotates once around this @xmath2-symmetric @xmath4-point .",
    "while an individual helical surface state is protected by the @xmath2-symmetry , level - crossings between any two different helical surface states are generally accidental : they can be lifted by a certain @xmath2- symmetric perturbation  @xcite . as a result of this pair annihilation",
    ", those insulators having even number of helical surface states can be adiabatically connected to an ordinary band insulator having no surface conducting channels at all ( ` weak topological insulator ' ) . on the other hand ,",
    "those with odd numbers of helical surface states are always accompanied by ( at least ) one gapless surface state , even when subjected under this pair annihilation ( ` strong topological insulator ' ) . in the presence of the @xmath2-symmetry",
    ", the latter type of insulators can not be decomposed into any two copies of spinless wavefunctions , and therefore regarded as a new quantum state of matter which goes beyond the quantum hall paradigm .    the quantum critical point  @xcite which intervenes this 3-d topological insulator and a @xmath2-symmetric ordinary band insulator is also non - trivial .",
    "that is , the stability of its critical nature is tightly connected to the stability of each helical surface state in the topological phase . to be specific ,",
    "consider that a certain @xmath2-symmetric model - parameter is changed , such that the system transits from the topological phase to a @xmath2-symmetric ordinary phase . during this , the helical surface state in the topological phase is always protected by the @xmath2-symmetry .",
    "when the system reaches the quantum critical point , however , the bulk - wavefunction becomes extended once .",
    "thus , the two helical surface states localized at two opposite sample boundaries can communicate via this extended bulk - wavefunction , only to annihilate with each other .",
    "thanks to this pair annihilation _ mediated by the extended bulk _ , the system can safely remove the stable helical surface state and enter the ordinary phase having no surface conducting channels , while simultaneously keeping the @xmath2-symmetry . to put this reversely , the bulk - extended character of the quantum critical point",
    "is required to be stable against any @xmath2-symmetric perturbations , provided that an individual helical surface state in the topological phase is stable against the same perturbations .",
    "such a quantum critical point can be dubbed as the strong topological quantum critical point .",
    "the above picture in the clean limit implies non - trivial disorder effects around this topological quantum critical point  @xcite . to describe this with clarity ,",
    "let us first define three independently - tunable physical parameters in the topological phase : ( i ) the ( topological ) band gap @xmath5 , ( ii ) the band width of the conduction / valence band @xmath6 , and ( iii ) non - magnetic disorder strengths @xmath7 .",
    "provided that @xmath8 , the helical surface state in the topological phase is stable against any non - magnetic disorders irrespective of @xmath6  @xcite . on increasing @xmath7 such that @xmath9 , those bulk - states far from the two band - centers , i.e. that of the conduction band and of the valence band , become localized ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) )  @xcite . especially near the zero - energy region , @xmath10",
    ", the system has no extended bulk wavefunctions .",
    "thus , two helical surface states localized at the two opposite boundaries respectively are disconnected from each other .",
    "starting from such a localized phase , consider decreasing the topological band gap ( or increasing the disorder strength ) , such that @xmath11 . during this decrease",
    ", these two disconnected surface states should communicate with each other once , so as to annihilate with each other , before the system enters the ordinary insulator phase .",
    "this requires that , at @xmath12 , the bulk - wavefunctions at @xmath13 must become extended once , so as to mediate these two opposite boundaries .",
    "moreover , it also requires that such a bulk - extended region always intervenes between the topological phase and the ordinary insulator phase in the three - dimensional parameter space spanned by the chemical potential @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "1(b , c ) ) .",
    "such behaviour of the bulk extended region is often dubbed as the levitation and pair - annihilation phenomena , and was ubiquitously observed also in other topological systems , such as quantum hall systems  @xcite and 2-d @xmath1 quantum spin hall systems  @xcite .    .",
    "( b , c ) schematic phase diagrams in the @xmath14-@xmath5-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the blue regions in these three figures stand for the delocalized state , which always intervene between the topological insulator phase and an ordinary insulator phase in any ` @xmath2-symmetric ' phase diagram .",
    "the figures are derived from ref .",
    "]    now that the 3-d @xmath1 topological band insulator is a new quantum state of matter having no quantum - hall analogue , the bulk - delocalized phase which intervenes this insulating phase ( or localized state adiabatically connected to this ) and the ordinary band insulator ( or corresponding localized state ) is also a new type of three - dimensional metallic phase , which has no analogue in any other condensed matter paradigms . taking into account the chemical - potential type disorder ( the most representative non - magnetic disorder ) ,",
    "we have previously studied  @xcite the self - consistent born phase digram around this topological metallic phase ( or quantum critical point ) and calculated the weak - localization correction to the charge conductivity . in actual solids  @xcite , however , electronic disorders can generally exist not just in the chemical potential , but also in the transfer integral and spin - orbit interaction potential itself . on the one hand ,",
    "the above argument based on the bulk - edge correspondence clearly dictates that the critical nature of the topological quantum critical point is stable against any of these non - magnetic disorders ( not just against the chemical potential type disorder ) .",
    "motivated by this , we will treat in this paper various types of non - magnetic disorder potentials on an equal footing , so as to argue actual / generic properties of the topological quantum critical point in disordered @xmath1 quantum spin hall systems .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2 , we summarize the effective continuum model studied in this paper .",
    "we next argue in sec .  3 that the non - trivial berry phase ( i.e. @xmath15 ) inherent in the 3-d topological quantum critical point ( tqcp ) induces the perfect cancellation in the backward scattering channels mediated by the chemical - potential type disorder .",
    "this _ partially _ upholds the above argument based on the bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "however , it also becomes clear that this ` berry phase ' argument does _ not necessarily _ work in the presence of those non - magnetic disorders other than the chemical - potential type one .",
    "more accurately , those backward scattering processes which do not conserve a certain internal degree of freedom , i.e. parity density degree of freedom , are _ not generally _ set off by their @xmath2-reversal counter processes . promoted by this theoretical observation , we further derive in sec .",
    "4 the self - consistent born phase diagram in the presence of _ generic _ @xmath2-symmetric disorder potentials . based on this , we argue in sec .  5 the weak - localization correction to the charge conductivity in the presence of both the chemical - potential type disorder and the topological - mass type disorder .",
    "the distinctions between the case with only the chemical potential disorder and that with _ generic _",
    "@xmath2-symmetric disorders are summarized / clarified in sec .",
    "an effective continuum model describing the topological quantum critical point is given by a following @xmath16 dirac fermion  @xcite ; @xmath17 where the two massive phases , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , represent the quantum spin hall insulator and the @xmath2-symmetric conventional ( band ) insulator respectively : ` @xmath20 ' corresponds to the topological band gap @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath21 by @xmath21 @xmath22-matrices consist of the pauli spin matrix part @xmath23 and the other pauli matrix @xmath24 representing the sublattice ( or orbital ) degree of freedom .",
    "there exist at most five such @xmath22-matrices which anti - commute with one another . here they are dubbed as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the product of these five always reduces to ( the minus of ) the unit matrix ; @xmath30 .",
    "thus , even numbers of @xmath22-matrices out of these five should be time - reversal ( @xmath2)-odd and spatial inversion ( @xmath31)-odd . in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , three of them are already linearly coupled with the momentum .",

    "( [ ham ] ) took @xmath32 to be @xmath2-odd and @xmath31-odd , so that @xmath33 is @xmath2-even and @xmath31-even . under this convention ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are all @xmath2-even and @xmath31-odd , while @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are all @xmath2-odd and @xmath31-even .",
    "thus , arbitrary ` on - site ' type non - magnetic disorder potentials are generally given by , @xmath44 with the real - valued functions @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite , we have further assumed that the chemical - potential type disorders is the most dominant and have set the other five to be zero : @xmath47 .",
    "based on these simplifications , we have carried out the self - consistent born analysis and weak - localization calculations , and obtained a simple microscopic picture , which can indeed explain how the bulk - extended region emerges when the topological band gap ` @xmath20 ' changes its sign  @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will describe an alternative argument , which more directly dictates that the topological metallic phase ( or quantum critical point ) is free from any localization effect induced by generic non - magnetic disorders .",
    "our argument here is a straightforward 3-dimensional generalization of the ` berry phase ' argument invented by ando _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of the carbon - nanotube ( or 2-d graphene ) subjected under _ long_-range impurity potentials .",
    "specifically , we will prove that an individual backward scattering process is precisely canceled by its time - reversal counterpart , which leads to a complete absence of the backward scattering in the 3-d topological quantum critical point .",
    "consider first the most simplest case , where the @xmath48-matrix is composed only by the chemical - potential - type impurity @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the momentum representation , the @xmath51-th order backward scattering term reads , @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) in combination with @xmath55 specifies the eigen - energy of the hamiltonian at the momentum @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 . such an eigen - energy is always accompanied by doubly degenerate eigen - states , which is specified by the spin index , @xmath58 .",
    "namely , each eigen - state at the momentum @xmath56 is uniquely identified by these two indices , @xmath59 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can take the initial ket - state and final bra - state to have an positive eigen - energy , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "( [ mat ] ) , @xmath68 where the summation over the spin indices associated with the intermediate states are assumed . to be more explicit , we can show that the following two have an opposite sign with each other , @xmath69 for any @xmath70 and @xmath71 . to see this ,",

    "it is expressed as ( a linear combination of ) the product between @xmath83 inner products and one outer product , @xmath84 with some coefficients @xmath85 free from @xmath86 . multiply this even - order term by one additional @xmath87",

    "( [ exp ] ) as a linear combination of @xmath88 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath37 ; @xmath89 @xmath90 is a vector composed of @xmath91 inner products , while @xmath92 is a scalar containing one scalar triple product , @xmath93 thus , under the time - reversal operation , i.e. @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath92 do not change the sign , while @xmath82 and @xmath96 change their signs .",
    "these observations lead to a perfect cancellation between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 for arbitrary @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this dictates that the backward - scattering process mediated by the chemical - potential - type disorder vanishes completely at the 3-d tqcp .",
    "more generally , we can prove that any backward scattering process _ which conserves the eigenvalue of @xmath100 _ is always set off by its corresponding @xmath2-reversal counterpart .",
    "such a process is always mediated by _ even _ number of either @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) or @xmath103 , since both @xmath104 ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath105 anticommute with @xmath100 . to uphold the complete absence of the backward scattering in this case , we have only to show that the following two matrix elements have an opposite sign with each other , @xmath106 for arbitrary @xmath70 and @xmath107 .",
    "the indices @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be either @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 or @xmath116 , under the condition that the total number of those @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 which mediate the initial state and the final state is always _",
    "even_. to see the relative sign between these two , let us first transport all the intervening @xmath121s in the leftward / rightward until they meet with the bra / ket states in @xmath122 /@xmath123 .",
    "this transport brings about an appropriate redefinition of the normalized vectors , @xmath124 , @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 is still connected by the @xmath2-reversal operation , @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the preceding expansion can be used again , @xmath129    the condition imposed on @xmath130 dictates that @xmath131 and @xmath132 always reduce to either ( i ) @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) respectively or ( ii ) @xmath136 and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) respectively .",
    "consider the former case first , e.g. @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    ", this cancellation is actually a direct consequence of the non - trivial berry phase ` @xmath15 ' accumulated along a closed loop composed by two time - reversal counterparts in the momentum space ( see fig .  [ pd0 ] ) .    ) , which are mutually time - reversal to each other .",
    "the blue - shaded region , whose boundary is shaped by this two path , occupies _",
    "one half _ of the whole surface of a sphere .",
    "thus , an electron acquires the berry phase @xmath148 ( instead of @xmath149 ) , when it travels once around this boundary . ]",
    "the above berry phase argument , however , does not hold true for the case with those backward scattering processes which change the eigenvalues of @xmath100 . to see this , consider , for example , the backward scattering processes mediated by _",
    "odd _ number of @xmath103 and compare following two @xmath2-reversal paired processes , @xmath150 we have already made any two ` neighboring ' @xmath120 to annihilate each other , which leads an appropriate redefinition of the normalized unit vectors .",
    "the extra @xmath120 was then transported leftward / rightward in @xmath126/@xmath127 , until it meets with the bra / ket - state . exploiting the expansion described above",
    ", we can readily see that these two do not cancel exactly in general , @xmath151    this situation is reminiscent of the 2-d graphene ( or carbon - nanotube ) subjected under _ short_-range impurity potentials , where the _ intervalley _ scattering suppresses the cancellation due to the berry phase and consequently induces the crossover from the symplectic class to the orthogonal class  @xcite .",
    "the situation in the 3-d tqcp is , however , quite different from this 2-d analogue .",
    "first of all , the preceding argument based on the bulk - edge correspondence requires the extended character of the 3-d tqcp to be stable against _ any _ non - magnetic disorders .",
    "moreover , it always belongs to the symplectic class irrespectively of the type of non - magnetic disorders , which was not the case in the 2-d graphene  @xcite .",
    "therefore , not only from the actual material s viewpoint  @xcite , but also from the theoretical standpoint , it is quite intriguing and important to investigate the effect of _ general _ @xmath2-symmetric disorder potentials ( including the topological - mass type one ) in the 3-d topological metallic phase . in the next section",
    ", we will first study how a single - body green function is renormalized by these _ general _ non - magnetic disorders . based on this analysis",
    ", we will argue the behaviour of the quantum conductivity correction in the presence of both the chemical - potential type disorder @xmath152 and topological - mass type disorder @xmath153 .",
    "consider @xmath154 with randomly distributed real - valued @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) . because of the @xmath2-reversal symmetry , each eigenstate of this , say @xmath157 , has its own kramers - paired state @xmath158 : @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the single - body green functions obey the following relation ; @xmath160 where ` @xmath161 ' sign is for the retarded / advanced green function @xmath162 .",
