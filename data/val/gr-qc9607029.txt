    "in the framework of general relativity , two theoretical aspects of cosmic strings have been mainly studied . the dynamical one in which the equations of motion of the infinitely thin cosmic string are governed by the nambu - goto action and",
    "secondly the self - gravitating one in which the straight cosmic string in particular is considered as the source of a gravitational field . in this case one finds that the asymptotical metric generated by the straight cosmic string is a conical metric @xcite and the case of a singular line is obtained in a limit process .",
    "the study of line sources in gravitation can be originated from a paper of israel @xcite in which the author concluded that there existed `` no simple general prescription [ ... ] for obtaining the physical characteristics of an arbitrary line source '' . however , vilenkin @xcite gave the physical meaning of the conical singularity as being a cosmic string .",
    "attention has been recently devoted in understanding the dynamics of a conical - type line source of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "the conclusions summarised in @xcite are as follows .",
    "a two - dimensional timelike worldsheet whose points are conical singularities of the 4-geometry can not be in general the dynamical evolution of a nambu - goto string of arbitrary initial shape .",
    "the conical singularity requires that the worldsheet is totally geodesic .",
    "this restraints the initial shape of the string as well as the evolution of each of its points to be a geodesic of the 4-geometry .    in this paper",
    ", we take up again the question of the dynamics but for a self - gravitating extended string .",
    "for a straight cosmic string , it is known that the exterior metric may be matched with an interior metric having as source an energy - momentum tensor with suitable properties .",
    "we consider a string of arbitrary shape but we restrict ourselves to the case of a thin tube of matter adopting the assumption that the exterior metric is locally the one describing a straight cosmic string .",
    "the interior metric is constrained from this and the energy - momentum tensor could be derived from the metric . the aim of the present work is to find the equations of motion of the central line of this thin tube of matter in the limit where its radius tends to zero .",
    "we emphasize that we do not consider directly a self - gravitating line . in our method , the conical points are smoothed out on a scale comparable to the radius of the string .",
    "the central line of this tube sweeps a timelike 2-worldsheet whose points are perfectly regular . a local coordinate system can then be attached to our spacetime by taking the two parameters of the worldsheet as the first two coordinates and the other two as geodesic coordinates pointing in a direction orthogonal to the worldsheet .",
    "this local coordinate system affixed to the worldsheet allows the natural introduction of the extrinsic curvature and other geometric parameters of the worldsheet .",
    "the interior metric of the string is essentially characterised by a function @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the radial coordinate whose origin lies on the worldsheet and @xmath2 is a length typical of the thickness of the string .",
    "the function @xmath3 is arbitrary , only submitted to certain conditions expressing the smoothness of the spacetime on the worldsheet , as well as the matching conditions on the boundary between the interior of the string and the vacuum .",
    "if no other conditions are imposed , we shall prove that the worldsheet tends to a totally geodesic surface , _ i.e. _ of vanishing extrinsic curvature , when @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "however we have found another possibility .",
    "if we impose on the function @xmath3 a specific supplementary constraint then the extrinsic curvature no longer tends to zero .",
    "nevertheless the mean curvature tends to zero when @xmath2 does and thus the worldsheet tends to be locally extremal which is precisely the behavior of the nambu - goto string .",
    "since the function @xmath3 is a characteristic of the metric in the interior of the string thus the constraint imposed is interpreted as a specification of the matter of the string .",
    "the paper is organised in the following manner .",
    "we recall in sec .",
    "ii the basic results on self - gravitating straight strings with some thickness and we describe the formalism that we shall use . in sec .",
    "iii , a self - gravitating string of arbitrary shape is introduced and the coordinate system adopted to its study is introduced . in sec .",
    "iv , we expand in powers of @xmath4 the geometrical quantities appearing in the einstein equations . in sec .",
    "v , taking the limit of @xmath2 going to zero of the einstein equations on the boundary between the string and the vacuum , we obtain the constraints that the worldsheet swept by the central line of the string must satisfy . finally in sec .",
    "vi , we find the nambu - goto energy - momentum tensor in the zero limit of @xmath2 , confirming the choice of the definitions adopted in sec .",
    "in a general relativistic context , it is possible to portray a straight string as a thin cylinder of matter @xcite .",
    "we give some basic features of a self - gravitating straight string since they will be used later on in the general case of strings of arbitrary shape .    in the coordinate system @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the given radius of the cylinder .",
    "the energy density @xmath10 is a positive regular function of @xmath11 .",
    "taking into account the einstein equations , the interior metric can be written as @xmath12 where the positive function @xmath13 determines @xmath10 by the formula , @xmath14 @xmath15 being the newtonian gravitational constant . in order to ensure a regular behavior of metric ( [ 2 ] ) at @xmath16",
    ", one must choose @xmath13 such that @xmath17 we can also require that the function @xmath13 is increasing .",
    "the exterior metric which can be matched to the interior metric ( [ 2 ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath18 where the constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined from the following matching conditions of the metric and its first derivatives at @xmath21 @xmath22    the linear mass density @xmath23 of the straight string is defined by @xmath24 by using ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , it is easy to see that it is related to the angular deficit @xmath25 of metric ( [ 5 ] ) by @xmath26 from ( [ 9 ] ) , we note that the exterior metric ( [ 5 ] ) is independent of the details of the internal string as well as of its radius .    at this point , it is enlightening to recall the solution for a straight string with @xmath27constant .",
    "the interior metric is characterised by @xmath28 and the exterior metric is again ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of the parameter @xmath2 will be given below .",
    "the matching conditions ( [ 6 ] ) give the relation @xmath29 and thereby @xmath30 we point out that @xmath31 depends only on @xmath19 .",
    "returning to the general case this particular solution suggests to impose in the generic interior metric ( [ 2 ] ) the following form @xmath32 where @xmath3 is a smooth function and @xmath2 is a parameter which takes again the value ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "now the matching conditions ( [ 6 ] ) yield simply @xmath33 for a given function @xmath3 , the quotient @xmath34 depends only on the constant angle @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ on the linear mass density @xmath23 by virtue of relation ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "one can give a geometrical interpretation . by performing the change of coordinate @xmath35 in metric ( [ 5 ] ) , we recognise the so called conical metric representing a cone of half angle @xmath19 .",
    "it is usefull to give a representation in a euclidean 3-space of the 2-surface @xmath36 constant and @xmath37 constant for the interior and exterior metrics ( cf .",
    "it can be visualised as a cone whose top is cut out at a distance @xmath38 of the vortex and replaced by an axisymmetric cap which joins the cone tangently along the circle of junction of radius @xmath39 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath1 represents the length of the radial geodesic of the 2-surface originated at the top of the cap .",
    "it takes the value @xmath9 at the boundary between the smooth cap and the cone and then it continues along a generatrix of the cone .",
    "the coordinate @xmath40 is the azimutal angle . referring to fig . 1",
    ", we see that @xmath41 , which represents the distance of the junction to the central axis , coincides with choice ( [ 11 ] ) . for the particular solution ( [ 10 ] ) we have a sperical cap of radius @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath42    in the generic case , @xmath3 is characteristic of the form of the cap and @xmath2 of its size .",
    "this explains the choice of form ( [ 12 ] ) of @xmath13 which allows us to wedge in the cone a cap of a given form of any size .",
    "in short , the 2-surface of the euclidean 3-space will be called a _ smoothed cone _ of half angle @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding spacetime will be said to have a _",
    "smooth conical point_. we emphasize that we can choose @xmath9 and @xmath2 as little as we want thus making the smooth cone as sharp as we want , but keeping the quotient @xmath31 fixed .",
    "finally , we shall also require the continuity of the second derivatives of the metric at the junction .",
    "this is simply achieved by putting @xmath43 as a consequence the ricci tensor is continuous at the junction . let us note that the supplementary condition ( [ 16 ] ) is not verified by the particular solution ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this was obvious from the beginning since the energy density @xmath10 is constant in the interior of a straight string and decreases sharply to zero at the boundary .",
    "the supplementary condition ( [ 16 ] ) is physically natural for a thick relativistic cosmic string but not absolutely necessary .",
    "its real usefulness is that the continuity of the ricci tensor makes easier further calculations in the neighborhood of the boundary between the cap and the cone .",
    "in the previous section we described a straight self - gravitating string with some thickness . the aim of this section is to extend this construction to a string of arbitrary shape .",
    "if the string thickness is sufficiently small and if the central line of the string spans a sufficiently smooth world sheet , we can suppose that the string approaches a straight one and thus it can be locally characterised by a smooth conical point .",
    "this suggests to determine the spacetime in the neighborhood of a small portion of the string in the following way : + - the interior metric given by @xmath44 where @xmath0 was specified in sec .",
    "ii and the metric components @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) are smooth . + - in the vicinity of the string , the exterior metric given by @xmath47 we note that _ a priori _ we have ommited cross terms in ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) in order to simplify the calculus .",
    "metric ( [ 17 ] ) is regular but the coordinate system breaks down at @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce coordinates @xmath48 @xmath49 which are well defined @xmath50 then , metrics ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) become @xmath51    let us introduce the function @xmath52 which is well defined and smooth in the interval @xmath53 from ( [ 4 ] ) . it has null odd derivatives at @xmath16 .",
    "the components @xmath54 have the simple expression @xmath55 in the interval @xmath56 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath57 .",
    "there will be no need in the following to express explicitely @xmath54 for @xmath58 .",
    "the central line of the string defined by @xmath16 spans a timelike worldsheet parametrised by @xmath59 whose induced metric is simply @xmath60 a radial geodesic on the 2-surface @xmath61 constant , is also a geodesic of the spacetime , normal to the worldsheet at the point @xmath62 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath1 represents the length along this geodesic measured from the point @xmath62 .",
    "so , the 2-surface @xmath61 constant is generated by the spacetime geodesics tangent at @xmath62 to a 2-plane orthogonal to the worldsheet .",
    "hence we recognise in the coordinate system @xmath63 a known system ( see for example @xcite ) where @xmath48 are geodesic coordinates and from which it is easy to extract the extrinsic curvature @xmath64 of the worldsheet by expanding the metric components @xmath65 as we shall see in sec .",
    "v , the extrinsic curvature is implicated in the dynamics of a self - gravitating string .",
    "the aim of this section is to expand in powers of 1/@xmath2 geometrical quantities such as the metric , connection and ricci tensor when @xmath2 , that is a measure of the thickness of the string , is small but not null .",
    "let us point out that all length parameters @xmath66 are of the same order since @xmath31 is constant",
    ".    in the interval @xmath53 all these quantities depend on the function @xmath67 through the metric components @xmath68 .",
    "however since @xmath69 it is preferable to substitute @xmath67 by a function of @xmath70 @xmath71 it is evident that @xmath72 is fixed and depends only of the angle @xmath19 .",
    "the same holds for its first and second derivatives @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the metric components ( [ 22 ] ) , their inverse , and the determinant can now be written @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol and @xmath79 stands for the induced geometrical quantities of the 2-dimensional smoothed cone .",
    "then one immediately gets @xmath80 by direct calculation of the first derivative one obtains @xmath81 it is also easy to see that @xmath82    now we can calculate the order of the non null connection coefficients for @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 we can now deal with the ricci tensor for @xmath83 . the derivatives of ( [ 35 ] ) will give terms of the order of @xmath4 , whereas the derivatives of ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) will give terms of the order @xmath88 . in obvious notations",
    "we obtain @xmath89 in which we have @xmath90 @xmath91 with @xmath92 .    for the small case indices we get @xmath93 in which we have @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the ricci tensor associated with the connection ( [ 36 ] ) of the smoothed cone , @xmath96 and @xmath97 finally for the mixed indices we get @xmath98 the curvature scalar @xmath99 for @xmath83 is given by the equation @xmath100 where @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "we have calculated the above quantities for @xmath83 since we need these estimations precisely at the boundary in order to obtain the equations of motion in the following section .",
    "we now focus attention on the self - gravitating string of arbitrary shape described by metric ( [ 20 ] ) in the coordinate system @xmath63 where the function @xmath3 is specified in sec .",
    "we suppose that the exterior spacetime is a vacuum solution : @xmath105 for @xmath106 .    the energy - momentum tensor @xmath107 of the extended string is the source of the einstein equations @xmath108 as a consequence of the matching conditions adopted , the ricci tensor must be continuous at the junction @xmath83 .",
    "so , the interior einstein equations ( [ 52 ] ) coincide with the vacuum einstein equations at @xmath21 @xmath109 these boundary conditions impose some constraints on the timelike worldsheet swept by the central line of the string",
    ". we shall examine ( [ 53 ] ) when the parameter @xmath2 is arbitrarily small .    according to ( [ 41])-([44 ] ) , the components @xmath110 of equations ( [ 53 ] )",
    "are written @xmath111 equation ( [ 54 ] ) being obtained by noting from ( [ 42 ] ) that @xmath112_{l_{\\small{0}}}= ( \\stackrel{\\wedge}{r}_{ab})_{l_{\\small{0}}}=0 $ ] since the junction @xmath21 belongs to the cone .",
    "we need to calculate the limit of the connection coefficient @xmath113 appearing in equation ( [ 54 ] ) . from ( [",
    "34 ] ) , ( [ 24 ] ) , ( [ 25 ] ) and since @xmath31 is constant we obtain @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the mean curvature of the timelike worldsheet . on the other hand we know from ( [ 36 ] ) that @xmath116 is of order @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the limit @xmath117 of equation ( [ 54 ] ) multiplied by @xmath2 gives @xmath118 where @xmath119\\ ] ] is finite . equation ( [ 57 ] ) is independent of @xmath2 or @xmath120 and depends only on the azimuthal angle @xmath40 on the boundary or equivalently as indicated of the unitary 2-vector @xmath121 .    in the same way using ( [ 37])-([39 ] ) along with ( [ 35]),([36 ] )",
    ", we obtain the zero limit of @xmath2 for the @xmath122 components of equations ( [ 53 ] ) @xmath123 where @xmath124\\ ] ] is finite .",
    "by introducing the quantities independent of @xmath2 @xmath125 after some algebra we can express @xmath126 in the following way @xmath127 k^{b}.\\ ] ] let us note that the mixed components @xmath128 of ( [ 53 ] ) give no constraint .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath129 and @xmath126 are non vanishing , which is the general case , equations ( [ 57 ] ) and ( [ 59 ] ) yield respectively @xmath130 @xmath131 equation ( [ 64 ] ) means that , at the zero limit of @xmath2 , the worldsheet swept by the central line of the string is totally geodesic .",
    "this of course implies ( [ 63 ] ) .",
    "we recover the situation described in the litterature @xcite when the string is a self - gravitating singular line .",
    "however we see from ( [ 62 ] ) that if we take the condition @xmath132 then one annihilates the extrinsic curvature coefficient and thus constraint ( [ 64 ] ) disappears .",
    "hence we are left with constraint ( [ 63 ] ) which expresses that in the zero limit of @xmath2 the world sheet is minimal . in other words",
    "the worldsheet has the same evolution as a nambu - goto string .",
    "we must verify however that when condition ( [ 65 ] ) is applied then equation ( [ 57 ] ) does not also disappear .",
    "equations ( [ 57 ] ) are explicitely expressed as @xmath133k_{1}+k^{1}[p+q(k^{2})^{2}]k_{2}=0 , \\\\    & & -k^{1}q(k^{2})^{2}k_{1}-k^{2}[2p+q(k^{2})^{2}]k_{2}=0 , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & & -k^{1}[2p+q(k^{1})^{2}]k_{1}-k^{2}q(k^{1})^{2}k_{2}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath121 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath136 and @xmath137 verify condition ( [ 65 ] ) , then the three equations ( [ 66 ] ) are reduced to only one : @xmath138 for all @xmath121 . hence ( [ 63 ] ) is again verified .    by their definition ( [ 61 ] ) , the quantities @xmath136 and @xmath137 are independent of the length parameters and depend only on the angle @xmath19 .",
    "that is , we can express condition ( [ 65 ] ) in terms of the angle @xmath19 by using ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "we obtain the simple expression @xmath139 this relation is a supplementary constraint on @xmath3 as it will be explained in the conclusion .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath140 of the string is obtained by an integration of @xmath107 on the section @xmath61 constant of the string .",
    "@xmath141 where now @xmath2 and thus @xmath9 are small but fixed .    from the einstein equations ( [ 52 ] ) and the algebraic expressions of the ricci tensor given in sec .",
    "iv , we can write in obvious notations    @xmath142    we first apply formula ( [ 72 ] ) for the @xmath122 components . only the first term of ( [ 73 ] ) will yield a non null finite integral when @xmath2 tends to @xmath143 since the volume element of the smoothed cone is of the order @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath145 now we have @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the gauss curvature , therefore @xmath148 since @xmath9 is small we can also approximate the metric @xmath45 by development ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath149 where @xmath23 is the linear mass density .",
    "the gauss - bonnet formula gives @xmath150 and consequently @xmath23 is related to @xmath19 by formula ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "this result is not obvious a priori .",
    "it originates specifically in the choice of the form of the metric ( [ 17 ] ) where @xmath13 is given by ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "a general discussion of the problem of obtaining the energy momentum tensor for a concentrate distribution of matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "the integral of the @xmath128 components obviously vanishes as @xmath151 . for the integral of the @xmath110 components the non null finite part vanishes since @xmath152 for a 2-dimensional manifold .",
    "thus the integral vanishes as @xmath2 .    discarding terms in @xmath2",
    ", @xmath140 reduces to @xmath153 given by ( [ 77 ] ) which is the energy - momentum tensor of the nambu - goto string .",
    "this last result which is proved independently of the equations of motion is in accordance with them .",
    "it can justify _ a posteriori _ the definition of a self - gravitating string as a smooth cone with metric ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dynamics of a self - gravitating string in the limit where the thickness @xmath2 becomes negligible . in the generic case",
    "the worldsheet swept by the string ( more precisely by the central line of the string ) is a totally geodesic surface ( the extrinsic curvature of the worldsheet is null ) .",
    "this result could have been somehow guessed since the strings defined as singular lines of conical points have precisely this property @xcite .",
    "however we have found another pleasant possibility : by imposing relation ( [ 71 ] ) the extrinsic curvature is no more relevant and only the mean curvature is null .",
    "this expresses that the worldsheet is extremal which is the behaviour of the nambu - goto string . if we suppose that the linear mass density @xmath23 is given , then the angle @xmath19 is fixed by equation ( [ 78 ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen that relation ( [ 71 ] ) is a constraint on the function @xmath3 ; it can be rewritten @xmath154 the above equation is an algebraic relation taken at the fixed point @xmath34 which is added to the matching conditions ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it is easily shown that such a function @xmath3 can be found in a polynomial form .",
    "the simplest solution is an odd polynomial ( cf .",
    "( 4 ) ) of order seven : @xmath155 the four unknown quantities @xmath34 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 can be determined as functions of the angle @xmath19 ( or equivalently as a function of the linear mass density @xmath23 of the string ) by the four equations ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 90 ] ) . of course by taking a polynomial of larger",
    "order one can get an infinity of solutions .",
    "it would probably be interesting to investigate the physical meaning of the constraint ( [ 90 ] ) on the matter of the string .    by using the method described in sec .",
    "iv , we can evaluate the riemann tensor @xmath159 at the junction @xmath21 or equivalently the weyl tensor since the ricci tensor ( [ 53 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this gives the magnitude of the gravitational field near the thin cosmic string . in the generic case where the extrinsic curvature @xmath160 vanishes ,",
    "the riemann tensor is bounded as the radius @xmath161 becomes arbitrarily small . on the contrary",
    "when only the mean curvature @xmath162 is null , the riemann tensor components @xmath163 blow up as @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath164 , when the radius @xmath161 tends to zero .",
    "we see that the gravitational aspect is completely different in the latter case .",
    "let us add that if we require that the riemann tensor remains bounded then we necessarily fall in the generic case .",
