    "gauge bosons of an extra u(1 ) symmetry in a hidden sector , so - called hidden photons , are well motivated since they arise naturally in string compactifications like the heterotic string or type - ii string theories .",
    "since the standard model ( sm ) is not charged under this new gauge group , there is no direct coupling and the interactions with the visible sector , and consequently the experimental constraints , are very weak .",
    "the hidden photon is additionally of great interest as it provides a solution to the discrepancy between the sm prediction of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and its experimentally measured value  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , models containing in the hidden sector a dark matter ( dm ) candidate which interacts with the visible sector via a light hidden photon have attracted much attention in the context of recent astrophysical observations  @xcite .    at low energies ,",
    "the dominant interaction of the hidden photon @xmath0 with the visible sector is through kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon .",
    "this can , for example , be generated from loops of heavy particles charged under both u(1)s  @xcite .",
    "integrating out those particles gives as an estimate for the size of the kinetic mixing the order of a loop factor @xmath1 .",
    "we then impose the following relation between the hidden gauge coupling @xmath2 and the kinetic mixing @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is @xmath6 and depends on the masses of the particles in the loop .    for the most simple hidden sector with just an extra u(1 ) symmetry and the corresponding hidden photon @xmath0 ,",
    "the low energy effective lagrangian describing the kinetic mixing with the photon is then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the field strength of the ordinary electromagnetic field @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the field strength of the hidden u(1 ) gauge field @xmath11 .",
    "a mass @xmath12 for the hidden photon can be generated either from the higgs mechanism or from the stckelberg mechanism . in both cases , masses around the gev - scale",
    "can be obtained naturally but much smaller values are also possible  @xcite .",
    "masses in the gev range can be tested and constrained especially by electron beam dump experiments .",
    "this has been studied in  @xcite for past beam dump experiments at slac and fermilab and further in  @xcite by taking into account the experimental acceptancies and two additional experiments at kek and in orsay .",
    "an overview of all current experimental constraints on the hidden photon for the mev to gev mass range is given in  @xcite .",
    "in general , the hidden sector can contain not only gauge but also matter fields .",

    "please refer to  @xcite .",
    "thus , for a wide range of parameters , the toy - model provides a dirac fermion as valid dm candidate with the possibility of explaining certain direct detection claims .",
    "embedding the idea of a hidden sector with dm into a more sophisticated and better motivated framework , we construct the simplest anomaly - free supersymmetric model which is possible without adding dimensionful supersymmetric quantities .",
    "the corresponding superpotential @xmath40 contains one dimensionless coupling @xmath41 and three chiral superfields @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are charged under the hidden u(1 ) . in the entire analysis",
    ", we assume the mssm in the visible sector , but our results are largely independent of this choice .",
    "we consider two mechanisms by which the hidden gauge symmetry is broken and show their different implications on the dm phenomenology .    in the first case ,",
    "the effective fayet - iliopoulos term , which is induced in the hidden sector through kinetic mixing with the visible higgs d - term , breaks the hidden gauge symmetry .",
    "we find that then the dm candidate can be either a dirac or a majorana fermion .",
    "as in the previous subsection , the dirac fermion possesses spin - independent scattering on nuclei and thus exhibits a similar phenomenology as the toy - model .",
    "this is shown in the scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig - susyscattplot ] ( left ) where we scanned both over the dm mass and the parameter @xmath5 in the range @xmath45 .",
    "again , the dark green points give the correct relic abundance and for those in purple the direct detection rate is consistent with cogent when a standard halo model is assumed .",
    "the plot only contains points for which the scattering cross section is in agreement with constraints from direct detection experiments . in difference to the toy - model , the lower part of the scatter plot can not be filled since the dm particle can not be heavier than the hidden photon and therefore the @xmath35-channel annihilation is not possible .",
    "the majorana fermion , on the other hand , due to its axial coupling , possesses mostly spin - dependent scattering which is less constrained by direct detection experiments .",
    "spin - independent scattering is possible also for the majorana fermion thanks to the higgs - portal term , but the cross sections are tiny , several orders of magnitude below current limits and without any hope of explaining direct detection claims .",
    "the scattering of the dirac fermion dm candidate in the left plot is spin - independent while the one of the majorana fermion in the right plot is mostly spin - dependent .",
    "dark green points give the correct dm relic abundance , light green ones a subdominant contribution and purple ones have spin - independent scattering cross sections in agreement with cogent.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]  @xcite .",
    "the scattering of the dirac fermion dm candidate in the left plot is spin - independent while the one of the majorana fermion in the right plot is mostly spin - dependent .",
    "dark green points give the correct dm relic abundance , light green ones a subdominant contribution and purple ones have spin - independent scattering cross sections in agreement with cogent.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the second case , the running of the yukawa coupling @xmath41 induces the breaking of the hidden gauge symmetry .",
    "the dm candidate turns out to be a majorana fermion which again , because of its mostly spin - dependent scattering , can not account for the claims in spin - independent direct detection experiments .",
    "scanning over the parameter space and @xmath5 in the range @xmath45 we find points that can give the correct relic abundance or a subdominant contribution as shown in the scatter plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - susyscattplot ] ( right ) in dark and light green , respectively .",
    "all points shown are in agreement with the limits arising from spin - dependent direct detection experiments .",
    "thus , also supersymmetric hidden sector models can give valid dark matter candidates which , in certain cases , have some similarities to the phenomenology that was obtained in the toy - model . results for other parameter settings and plots of the scattering cross sections in the different scenarios compared to experimental limits are given in  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a hidden sector with a dark force is well motivated from a top - down ( string theory , susy ) and a bottom - up ( @xmath46 , dm ) point of view . because of the weak interactions with the sm , such scenarios are not much constrained , and we presented here new limits from past electron beam dump experiments on the hidden photon mass and kinetic mixing .",
    "if the hidden sector also contains dm , we showed that a toy - model with dirac fermion dm gives the right relic abundance and spin - independent scattering cross sections able to explain claims in direct detection experiments . for a more sophisticated supersymmetric hidden sector with hidden gauge symmetry breaking induced by the visible sector",
    ", we find a dirac fermion dm candidate with similar phenomenology",
    ". a majorana fermion with mostly spin - dependent scattering can also be the dm candidate in this scenario or when the hidden gauge symmetry is broken radiatively .",
    "our supersymmetric models with gravity mediation have therefore proven to provide viable dm candidates with interesting potential for direct detection experiments .",
