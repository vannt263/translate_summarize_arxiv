    "the absorption of electromagnetic radiation due to the interaction with electrons in bulk crystals is essentially determined by two distinct effects : ( i ) the free carrier absorption ( fca ) , which is directly related to the electrical conductivity and drops with frequency on the scale of the inverse scattering time .",
    "( ii ) interband transitions , which are typically described via the dipole moments induced by the coupling between states in different bands . for most crystals",
    "these transition energies are of the order of ev and thus this dominates the response around the optical spectrum .",
    "in addition to these electronic features , optical phonons provide absorption in the far infrared region , which is not addressed here .",
    "semiconductor heterostructures provide an additional effective potential for the electron in the conduction band causing a further quantization of the electronic states in the growth direction ( denoted by @xmath0 ) .",
    "taking into account the degrees of freedom for motion in the @xmath1 plane , this establishes subbands within the conduction band .",
    "commonly , the absorption between these subbands is treated analogously to the interband transitions in bulk crystals .",
    "the standard treatment relies on the envelope functions @xmath2 for the subbands @xmath3 with energies @xmath4 and areal electron densities @xmath5 using expressions for the absorption coefficient @xmath6 as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and the counter - rotating terms are neglected . here",
    "@xmath9 is the elementary charge , @xmath10 is the refractive index , and @xmath11 is the vacuum permeability ( si units are used ) .",
    "the matrix element @xmath12 describes the coupling strength . throughout this work",
    "we assume the polarization of the electric field to point in @xmath0-direction and that the wave propagates in a waveguide of effective thickness @xmath13 which is filled by the ( layered ) semiconductor material .",
    "this scheme is also routinely applied for the calculation of the gain spectrum of quantum cascade lasers ( qcls).@xcite in this context the broadening @xmath14 can be either added in a phenomenological way @xcite or by detailed calculations , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "it can also be seen as a limiting case of a full quantum kinetic calculation.@xcite    while the conventional treatment of intersubband transitions is well accepted for transitions in the infrared , this approach is less obvious for thz systems , which have become of high interest.@xcite here , fca - related features might turn up as a strong competing mechanism to the intersubband gain transition in analogy to the bulk case where both fca and interband transitions occur as separate processes . in order to demonstrate the potential relevance",
    ", we consider the standard expression for fca in bulk systems@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the effective mass , @xmath17 the volume density of electrons in the conduction band , and @xmath18 is the scattering time . as an example for gaas with a doping of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ps ( corresponding to a mobility of 6000 @xmath21/vs at 300k @xcite ) one obtains @xmath22 for a frequency @xmath23 thz .",
    "this is larger than typical gain coefficients in thz quantum cascade lasers.@xcite thus , bulk fca would provide a strong obstacle in achieving lasing in such structures and its proper treatment in heterostructures is of crucial importance for the description of qcls or other thz heterostructure devices .",
    "( for a typical infrared laser , in contrast , it was shown that fca in the cascade structure does not play a role.@xcite ) in ref .",
    "fca was only considered in the waveguide layers but not the qcl structure itself , where the absorption was determined by intersubband transitions .",
    "furthermore , in ref .   it was shown that processes as described by eq .",
    "( [ eqalphaintersubband ] ) dominate the absorption of light ( with @xmath0-polarized electric field ) for quantum wells .    in this context",
    "the question arises how such a treatment based on intersubband transitions is related to the fca in the bulk .",
    "is fca related to the seemingly dominating intersubband processes or does it stem from further processes not identified yet ? in the latter case , such processes could strongly alter the thz performance of heterostructure devices . in order to shed light on this important issue",
    "we present a detailed study on the unfolding of fca starting from different types of heterostructure .",
    "our main conclusion is that the absorption due to intersubband transitions evolves into the bulk fca for vanishing barrier widths .",
    "this shows that a proper treatment of intersubband transitions provides a complete description of gain and absorption processes in heterostructure devices .",
    "we consider four gaas - al@xmath24ga@xmath25as superlattices@xcite ( sls ) with constant period @xmath26 nm . the barrier width is set equal to 0.5 nm , 1.5 nm , 2.5 nm , and 3.5 nm , respectively , and a homogeneous doping with @xmath27 is used .",

    "the conductivity for the 0.5 nm barrier structure provides a scattering time of @xmath38 fs .",
    "this value agrees roughly with the momentum scattering rate @xmath39ps ( which is the sum of the elastic and inelastic scattering rate@xcite ) extracted from several highly doped gaas / alas sls with narrow barriers at room temperature.@xcite this value is much smaller than the bulk scattering time of 0.2 ps , as scattering is enhanced due to the presence of rough interfaces in all sls ( which are particular strong scatterers for small barrier widths , when the wave functions highly penetrate through the barriers ) .",
    "in addition , the assumption of a constant scattering time is only expected to be of semi - quantitative nature , the same holds for the approximations in matrix elements used .",
    "( for a more detailed treatment of roughness scattering in thin barriers , see ref .  . ) using @xmath38 fs , the drude expression ( [ eqdrude ] ) fits the absorption quite well , demonstrating , that these small barriers actually provide almost the bulk free carrier absorption behavior .    with increasing barrier thickness",
    "the conductivity becomes smaller due to the reduced coupling between the quantum wells .",
    "accordingly , there is a decrease in the low frequency absorption @xmath40 as it follows from electrodynamics.@xcite here our numerical calculations are in full agreement , as we do not employ the rotating wave approximation and include broadening in a fully consistent way .",
    "furthermore , for thicker barriers , the absorption between the minibands becomes more prominent and thus the absorption increases close to the photon energy required to overcome the gap between the first and the second miniband , as indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ figslabs](b ) .",
    "the shift of the peak positions with respect to the minigaps can be related to scattering induced level shifts . for the 2.5 nm barrier the results are in good agreement with the measurements reported in ref .  .",
    "the onset of absorption around 100 mev is slightly sharper in the experiment , which may be attributed to less rough interfaces or to the limited accuracy of the various approximations used for the scattering potentials .    for sls",
    "the absorption can be understood within the common miniband picture . for low frequencies intra - miniband processes dominate , which are easily treated in semiclassical transport models providing for zero electric field@xcite @xmath41 this behavior",

    ", transitions between the minibands can describe the absorption between 60 and 200 mev very well .",
    "see , e.g. , the results of the calculations in ref .  , which fully agree with our more sophisticated negf approach .",
    "we conclude that the absorption of sls at zero bias can be well described by the drude - like miniband conduction result ( [ eqalphamb ] ) for low frequencies and by common inter - miniband transitions for higher frequencies . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figslabs](b ) , the combination of both features evolves into the bulk fca ( [ eqdrude ] ) if the barrier width becomes small .",

    "essentially the two lowest subbands are occupied in thermal equilibrium , and one observes clear absorption peaks corresponding to the separations between the subbands , see fig .",

    "[ figwellabs](c ) .",
    "while this is quite expected , peak i does not show any clear splitting , but shifts to lower frequencies , approaching the intra - miniband absorption . this behavior can be understood by a detailed study of the multi - quantum - well eigenstates . here ,",
    "a tight binding model for @xmath46 wells with next neighbor coupling @xmath47 shows ( see the appendix [ secappendix ] for details ) : ( i ) there are @xmath46 eigenstates , labeled by an index @xmath3 according to their energy @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath48 is of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "( ii ) the matrix element @xmath50 from eq .  ( [ eqzmatrix ] ) is small unless for neighboring states , i.e. @xmath51 .",

    "[ figwellabs](c ) , where @xmath53 essentially corresponds to the miniband width of the infinite structure .",
    "together with a tail at higher frequencies due to broadening of these transitions this explains the appearance of the drude - like miniband absorption for the sl in the limit of large @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath54 the evolution is not smooth as any finite sequence of quantum wells has a zero dc conductivity in contrast to an infinite sl and thus the absorption must vanish according to eq .",
    "( [ eqalphasigma ] ) .",
    "summing over all possible intersubband transitions ( [ eqalphaintersubband ] ) , we obtain the total absorption @xmath55 . here",
    "the discrete index @xmath3 runs over all ( infinitely many ) eigenstates of the heterostructure of finite length , including states which correspond to unbounded states with energies far above the barrier potential .",
    "integrating over all frequencies provides @xmath56 under the assumption @xmath57  otherwise the counter - rotating terms become of relevance , which had been neglected here . in appendix [ secappgft ]",
    "we show that the same integral relation is more generally obtained for arbitrary level spacings @xmath58 within our negf model , which also covers dispersive gain.@xcite    following ref .  , eq .",
    "( [ eqalphais ] ) can be simplified by the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule@xcite ( also called f - sum rule@xcite ) which reads for a parabolic band with effective mass @xmath16 @xmath59 and provides the integrated absorption @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average three - dimensional carrier density in the waveguide .    for a bulk semiconductor , the free carrier absorption ( [ eqdrude ] )",
    "provides after integration over energy @xmath62 which fully agrees with the intersubband result ( [ eqintintersubband ] ) for equal total densities @xmath63 .",
    "thus the total fca in a bulk semiconductor equals the total intersubband absorption within the conduction band for a finite heterostructure of finite length , which shows the direct relation between these .",

    "( [ eqintfca ] ) using the gaas effective mass .",
    "this minor discrepancy of less than 7% can be easily attributed to some absorption at higher frequencies and the impact of the barrier material with a larger mass . was obtained for the 0.5 nm barrier and the minimal value of @xmath67 for the 3.5 nm barrier in fig .  [",
    "figslabs](b ) . ]",
    "we conclude , that the absorption obtained by our negf code is in excellent agreement with the rule ( [ eqintintersubband ] ) .",
    "more generally the effect of the semiconductor heterostructure can be understood as shifting the absorption strength within the frequency space , as explicitly demonstrated by our calculations .",
    "this perception has actually been used in the design of qcl structures , where the unavoidable free carrier absorption is deflected from the frequency region of operation by a proper choice of heterostructures @xcite , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "we demonstrated how the common bulk free carrier absorption evolves from standard intersubband absorption in heterostructures for electromagnetic waves with an electric field pointing in growth direction . here",
    "the well - studied sl absorption constitutes an intermediate case , which can be entirely understood on the basis of common intersubband absorption processes in the limit of a growing number of quantum wells . for decreasing sl barrier width the combination of inter- and",
