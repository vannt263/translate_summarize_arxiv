    "many complex networks @xcite that describe physical and biological systems are _ spatial _ in the sense that the nodes and edges are embedded into real space @xcite . a classic example is a transportation network , where stations correspond to nodes and where physical routes , such as roads or railways , correspond to network edges @xcite .",
    "some biological systems can also be thought of as transportation networks , for example transmitting electrical signals as is the case in collections of neurons or large - scale brain areas @xcite .",
    "the physical nature and spatial embedding of these systems often imposes costs on network wiring , making spatially long - distance connections improbable , and thereby constraining the network s topology @xcite .",
    "pressures that compete against wiring minimization include those driving network efficiency and robustness .",
    "tradeoffs between these desirable network features can differ across systems , and directly inform the design of optimal spatial distribution networks @xcite .",
    "biological distribution systems often grow and evolve in particularly interesting environments , and are indeed subject to the competing pressures of maintaining low material costs while achieving high efficiency and robustness .",
    "distribution systems can constitute an entire organism  such as mycelial fungi  in which the physical cords making up the organism can be represented as edges in a network , and in which branching , fusion , or end points among those cords can be represented as nodes in a network @xcite .",
    "these systems appear to strike an intermediate balance between cost and efficiency , enabling the organism to achieve competing goals .",
    "in addition , their network architecture changes and adapts over time in a way that tends to strengthen beneficial qualities @xcite . alternatively , distribution systems can form only a small part of an organism  as is the case with cortical vasculature  in which a pial network on the surface of the brain routes blood to penetrating arterioles , that in turn supply the underlying tissue @xcite . the pial surface network from rodent brains",
    "can also be represented as a network , in which edges are vessels , and nodes represent either branching points among those vessels or a branch to a penetrating arteriole @xcite .",
    "this system forms a robust backbone of loops that can withstand damage and re - rout flow in the presence of occlusions @xcite .",
    "in both the fungal and vasculature systems , two - dimensional , planar distribution networks must transport fluid and nutrients efficiently in the face of constraints on the total amount of material that they can support .",
    "but in spite of these commonalities , the two networks exist and have evolved in inherently different environments , which may directly impact the sorts of evolutionary pressures that the network might experience .",
    "for example , the main role of the vasculature network is to transport blood to and from tissue that is part of a larger organism . on the other hand , for fungi",
    ", the network is the organism itself and is not necessarily constrained to serve or occupy a set region of space .",
    "moreover , brain vasculature resides in a controlled environment within the confines of the skull , whereas fungal networks live in and must adapt to often unprotected and varied environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "in addition , while directed flow and growth are known to be important in both vasculature and fungi , the mechanisms of long - distance transport of nutrients and maturation are different in the two systems @xcite .",
    "however , while the different roles , habitats and function of vasculature _ vs. _ mycelial systems should directly affect their network architecture , little is known about what these similarities or differences in structure might be .    to better understand the network configurations of different types of distribution systems , we utilize a set of methodologies to investigate both the _ physical _ and _ topological _ structure of mycelial fungi and rodent brain vasculature networks .",
    "we first uncover architectural commonalities in the network organization of both systems in the form of previously unidentified physical and topological scaling relationships that indicate hierarchical structure , and constrained spatial embedding .",
    "we also show that a theoretical model for distribution networks  based on an optimization of transport efficiency in the face of fluctuations in load  is able to reproduce the same design features , and thus provides a mechanism through which the empirically observed spatial and topological network organization might arise . yet despite these shared features of network structure , the two types of networks also display differences in the complexity of their architectures , suggesting that each system may be differently optimized for cost , efficiency , and robustness . by comparison to a set of spatially - informed null models , we explicitly examine",
    "the _ relative _ relationships between these three quantities , and compare and contrast the associated tradeoffs across organisms .",
    "this analysis uncovers clear differences in how the two types of distribution networks balance competing goals .",
    "taken together , our work uncovers several common organizational principles across distribution systems , but also identifies critical distinctions that we hypothesize may be markers for the network s function and reflect the environment in which that function must be performed .",
    "we study the vasculature and fungi by considering both as _ complex networks _ , each represented by an adjacency matrix @xmath0 . in an unweighted network ,",
    "@xmath1 if there is an edge between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and zero otherwise .",
    "this results in a binary connectivity matrix that captures the topological structure of the system . in spatial networks",
    ", there is often additional information due to the embedding of the network in physical space . here",
    ", the networks are embedded into two - dimensional space , so a given node @xmath2 has a spatial coordinate , @xmath4 , which allows the euclidean distance between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath5 , to be computed .",
    "we examine the surface vasculature from the neocortex of four rats and five mice @xcite , and three different species of mycelial fungi , including _ phallus impudicus ( p.i . )",
    "_ , _ phanerochaete velutina ( p.v .",
    "1 ) _ ( grown from five inocula ) , _ phanerochaete velutina ( p.v .",

    "more information about the data and network construction can be found in _",
    "methods _ and the _ s.i._.      an important question regarding biological transport systems is whether distribution networks of different types or from different organisms exhibit universal characteristics that allow for high functionality , and in particular , whether they achieve low - cost embeddings into physical space while maintaining topologies that support efficiency and robustness . to address these questions",
    ", we draw on fundamental insights from computer science developed in the 1960s in the context of very large scale integrated ( vlsi ) circuits @xcite . at that time",
    ", it was noted that a salient feature of computer chips  whose abstract topologies enabled complex information flow and computational functions  was _",
    "rentian scaling _ , and that this feature allowed for a low - cost embedding of the circuitry into physical space , facilitated by generally short wires @xcite .",
    "rentian scaling manifests in a power law relationship between the number of logic gates ( or nodes ) @xmath6 in a region of the network and the number of terminals ( or edges ) @xmath7 passing through that region , such that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rent exponent .",
    "this principle of physical embedding has been observed in both artificial and natural intelligent systems @xcite , and in general , signifies hierarchical network structure .",
    "importantly , this scaling notion extends ideas of self - similarity ( such as the fractal dimension @xcite ) , which have otherwise been agnostic to spatial constraints .    to determine the presence or absence of such a principle in biological distribution networks , we place square boxes of different sizes over each network",
    "( see _ s.i .",
    "_ for details ) , and define @xmath10 to be the number of nodes within a box , and @xmath11 to be the number of edges crossing the boundary of a box ( fig  [ f : prent]a , b ) . here",
    ", @xmath11 is a measure of the amount of flow that can pass into or out of a given region of the network , relative to the number of nodes , or distribution sites , within that region . after laying 5000 boxes over the network , we test for the scaling relationship @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the physical rent exponent .",
    "we observe that all networks considered show evidence of physical rentian scaling with @xmath13 ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( for examples of this relationship in vasculature and a mycelial system , see fig .",
    "[ f : prent]c , d , respectively ) .",
    "this finding implies that the spatial layout of the distribution networks is hierarchically organized , and suggests an efficient embedding of the network into physical space in terms of short node - to - node distances . while scaling was weakest in the mouse vasculature , for all networks , we found pearson s correlation coefficients of @xmath16 ; @xmath13-value @xmath17 ( _ s.i . _ ) . to give context to the exponent values",
    ", we also report @xmath13 for several idealized network topologies in table  [ t : rent_ideal ] , including a triangular lattice , a square lattice , a hexagonal lattice , and a minimum spanning tree ( averaged over several realizations ) .",
    "more details on the construction of each of these networks can be found in the _ s.i . _",
    "the vasculature networks have exponents greater than that of a minimum spanning tree or square lattice , and fall roughly in the same range of @xmath13 as a hexagonal lattice .",
    "many of the fungal networks also have exponent values similar to either a hexagonal or triangular lattice , but some are outside this range and it thus appears that they can not be explained by the physical architecture of the regular lattices .",
    ".physical and topological rentian scaling exponents for idealized networks . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : trent_corrreduced ]      in order to better frame the scaling exponents of the real fungal and vasculature networks , we compared them to the exponents from a set of idealized topologies : triangular lattice , square lattice , hexagonal lattice , and minimum spanning tree .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath18 for each of these networks are reported in table  [ t : rent_ideal ] of the main text .",
    "each lattice was constructed in a square region . for a proper comparison among the different types , we fixed the side of each unit ( triangle , square , hexagon ) to be equal to 1 , and fixed the number of nodes to be approximately the same for each lattice and on the same order as the mean number of nodes across all of the real data ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "( due to the different symmetries of each lattice , a perfect matching of the number of nodes was not possible while simultaneously ensuring the lattices were contained in a square region with equal side length ) .",
    "we thus used @xmath20 for the triangular grid , @xmath21 for the square grid , and @xmath22 for the hexagonal grid , which we found to be the best balance between having a near constant number of nodes across the different lattices while also being close to the mean number of nodes across all of the real networks .",
    "as described above , the topological partitioning was run 50 times for each network , and we report average values of the topological scaling exponent .",
    "physical and topological scaling was significant in all lattices , with pearson s correlation coefficients for the scaling relationship satisfying @xmath16 in each case .",
    "for the minimum spanning tree ( _ mst _ ) , we placed @xmath23 nodes ( the mean number of nodes used for the lattices ) at random in a box of equal side length .",
    "the spanning tree was then computed on that set of points using the method described below , in sec .",
    "[ s : null_models ] . since different instantiations of the node placements yield different spanning trees , we constructed 50 networks ",
    "each from different random initialization of the nodes  and reported average values of the physical rentian scaling exponent . in each case , the scaling was significant , with @xmath16 .",
    "the spanning trees do not exhibit topological scaling .",
    "in spatial networks , the nodes and edges exist in real euclidean space , and this physical embedding often has significant consequences for the network topology @xcite .",
    "for example , both the fungal and vasculature networks are _ planar _ ( or nearly planar ) , meaning that no edges cross . an important constraint for biological systems , in particular , may be the material and energetic costs associated with building and maintaining the physical structure of the network .",
    "but in competition is the fact that distribution networks must be able to move resources efficiently and be robust to damage . in order to gain an understanding of how the physical embedding of these networks might affect their architecture , and how distinct types of biological transport systems may differentially balance these pressures , we examined two planar null model networks : the minimum spanning tree ( _ mst _ ) and the greedy triangulation ( _ gt _ ) .",
    "the same or similar null models have previously been used in the analysis of fungal systems , @xcite , slime mould @xcite , ant networks of galleries @xcite , and urban street networks @xcite .",
    "the _ mst _ is a planar graph that connects all of the nodes in a network such that the sum of the total edge weights is minimum . by construction",
    ", the _ mst _ also contains the minimum number of edges @xmath24 needed to connect the network ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of nodes ) . in the biological distribution networks studied here , the relevant edge weights are their physical lengths .",
    "therefore , we preserve the true geographic locations of all nodes in each network , and compute the _ mst _ on the matrix of euclidean distances , @xmath27 , between all node pairs .",
    "this network minimizes the total material cost @xmath28 of the network ( defined as the sum of all edge lengths ) :    @xmath29    and thus allows for testing the extent to which biological distributions systems are optimized for minimal wiring .",
    "we computed the _ _",
    "mst__s for all networks using the algorithm from the matlab boost graph library package @xcite .",
    "the _ gt _ lies on the opposite end of the spectrum , and is a maximally connected  in terms of number of edges  planar network .",
    "in particular , following @xcite , we compute _ _",
    "gt__s on the true node locations of all real networks by iteratively connecting pairs of nodes in ascending order of their distance , while maintaining that no edges be allowed to cross . as with the _ mst",
    "_ , this null model is also constructed under a geographical constraint , but since it contains many more edges , it represents an effective upper bound on the material cost of a planar network .",
    "thus , the _ gt _ can be used to gain an understanding of how the structure and capabilities of the true vasculature and fungi compare and contrast to networks where the total wiring cost is not optimized for .",
    "in this study , we investigate similarities and differences between two distinct types of biological distribution networks , in terms of how they are simultaneously optimized for cost , efficiency , and robustness .",
    "it is important to note that these measures have previously been used to quantify and compare the structure of fungal networks to low - cost and high - cost null models @xcite . here",
    ", we build on and extend prior analyses along this line of inquiry by examining the _ relative _ tradeoffs and relationships between this set of quantities , and most importantly , by comparing and contrasting these tradeoffs across organisms .",
    "in particular , we utilize a set of metrics that measure how close or far a given real network is from its two extreme null models , allowing for a direct quantification and comparison of the vasculature and fungi .",
    "below , we explain these quantities in more detail .",
    "we first note that in spatial networks such as those considered here , it is often _ physical _ rather than _ topological _ distances that are important . therefore , rather than the total number of edges , the material cost of a network is defined to be the sum of the lengths of all connections ( eq .  [ eq : total_wiring ] ) , which provides an estimate of how  expensive \" the system is to construct and maintain .    along a similar line of reasoning",
    ", the shortest physical path between any two pairs of nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 is taken to be the path that minimizes the sum of the edge lengths between those nodes .",
    "this is in contrast to the shortest topological path between the same nodes , which is that which connects @xmath2 and @xmath3 along the fewest number of edges , and thus neglects geographic information . to illustrate the differences , fig .",
    "[ f : wiring_eff_paths]a of the main text shows a toy network that highlights the shortest physical path and topological path between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "knowing the shortest paths between all node pairs allows for the calculation of the average efficiency @xcite , @xmath30 , which is one way to quantify the ease of flow and communication between nodes of a network . denoting the length of the shortest physical path between @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath31 , the average efficiency is given by      it is common practice to normalize the efficiency for a given network with @xmath26 nodes by its value for the corresponding fully - connected @xmath26-node network .",
    "this results in the _ global efficiency _ , which we denote simply as @xmath33 .",
    "shortest path and efficiency measures have previously been used to study spatial networks such as ant galleries @xcite , street patterns in cities @xcite , the brain @xcite , slime mould @xcite , and fungal networks @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge , have not yet been used to study vasculature .",
    "another desirable feature for both natural and man - made networks is robustness . in other words ,",
    "how well - connected does the system remain when subjected to damage ?",
    "this is an important consideration in both the vasculature and fungal networks . in fungal networks ,",
    "damage can occur either from rough environmental conditions or from predation @xcite , and in vasculature , a common source of damage is from the formation of blood clots that block vessels and prevent flow , leading to stroke .",
    "previous work on fungal networks has shown that these organisms can achieve high levels of robustness to attack @xcite . in the study on rodent vasculature @xcite",
    ", interconnected loops were found to provide robustness to the backbone of surface vessels under edge deletion , and after occlusion to a surface arteriole , the backbone was able to re - rout blood flow and preserve the surrounding neuronal tissue .    in the main text",
    ", we assess differences in how the two different types of transport networks balance material costs with network robustness .",
    "in particular , we analyze how the size of the largest connected component evolves under the random removal of edges from the network , and take the robustness , @xmath34 , of the network to be the percentage of edges removed in order for the size of the largest connected component to drop to half of its original value . since we examine random edge removal , there can be some variation in the results when the same procedure is run again on the same network .",
    "we thus compute @xmath34 20 times for each network in order to generate a representative ensemble average .",
    "we should also note that in our analysis , we consider the robustness of the entire vasculature network , rather than just the backbone considered in @xcite .",
    "this allows for a cleaner comparison between the vasculature and fungi , and takes into consideration the many nodes that branch directly off the backbone .",
    "the material cost , efficiency , and robustness are all useful quantities to consider in the context of biological networks , but when considered in isolation , it is difficult to understand how they are related to one another and how they compare across similar networks of different size or of completely different type . in order to better understand how the vasculature and fungal systems might be differentially optimized for each of these measures , we used a set of normalized quantities that captured how the wiring cost , efficiency , and robustness of a given network compared to the approximate limiting values for a network of the same size with the same node locations .",
    "in particular , following @xcite , this is quantified by defining a _ relative _ cost , efficiency , and robustness .",
    "the relative cost is given by   + @xmath35   + where @xmath28 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denote the total wiring of the real , _ mst _ , and _ gt _ , respectively . in a similar manner ,",
    "the relative global efficiency , @xmath38 , is given by   + @xmath39   + and the relative robustness @xmath40 is   + @xmath41   + by definition , the _ mst _ is minimally wired , but since it contains no shortcuts between nodes , we also expect it to have high average shortest path and low efficiency .",
    "it is also clear that the removal of any edge will break the _ mst _ into disconnected components . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ gt _ is a highly expensive network to build , but this increase in material for the same set of nodes should improve the robustness as well as the efficiency of the network , since it allows for shortcuts between pairs of otherwise more distant nodes .",
    "thus , the _ mst _ is an effective lower bound for material cost , efficiency and robustness , and the _ gt _ is a good approximation for a planar network that achieves upper bounds with respect to the same measures .",
    "the relative measures are normalized between 0 and 1 for the _ mst _ and _ gt _ , respectively , and this normalization allows for a direct quantification of where the real distribution networks lie in comparison to the limiting values .",
    "furthermore , the relative quantities can be used to understand and properly contrast the tradeoffs between wiring , efficiency , and resistance to random damage between the vasculature and fungi ."
