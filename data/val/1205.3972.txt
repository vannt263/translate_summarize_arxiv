    "the formulation of quantum mechanics in discrete variables is relevant to various aspects of undulatory physics .",
    "the applications range from solid state ( tight - binding arrays @xcite , polymers @xcite , photonic structures @xcite ) to fundamental questions concerning the structure of space ( discrete canonical variables @xcite , cellular automata @xcite , algebraic deformations and bound states @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of this kind of systems seems to be a natural area of study , filling a gap between the energy domain description and a time domain formulation yet to be explored .",
    "moreover , among the many dynamical problems that one may pose , we distinguish diffraction by edges and the propagation of discontinuities ( in space and in time @xcite ) as the most prominent representatives . in continuous space , these examples contain the effects of infinitesimal wavelengths . in discrete space ,",
    "the natural frequency cut - off might be used to conjecture new effects .",
    "but beyond these conjectures , it is necessary to solve the propagation problem of specific distributions .    in this paper",
    "we tackle some time - dependent problems by computing explicitly the propagator of an infinite tight - binding chain .",
    "this is equivalent to the discretized one - dimensional space propagator or the green s function of a two - dimensional photonic structure in the lowest frequency band .",
    "the mathematical tools employed here , although of a simple nature ( bessel functions ) , constitute an original contribution of this work . they shall be thouroughly developed in order to get new results in the problem of diffraction .",
    "this applies to propagation in a periodic background and the effects produced by a minimal spacing between points .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we compute the propagator for the discrete schrdinger equation by spectral decomposition ( one or many dimensions for cubic lattices ) .",
    "as this object differs from its continuous counterpart , it is necessary to reveal its properties and its connection with feynman paths in space and time .",
    "this shall be done in sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively . in section 3",
    "we move to specific time - dependent problems by applying the propagator to distributions of the edge type : a point - like distribution viewed as a minimal length wavepacket ( section 3.1 ) , the discrete version of the moshinsky shutter ( section 3.2 ) and a poissonian profile generalizing the former examples ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "section 4 establishes the connection between diffraction in time in discrete space and the scattering of two - dimensional waves by a screen .",
    "here it is shown that the scattering problem in a periodic background ( such as that provided by a photonic structure ) can be viewed as a problem of propagation along the optical axis , with periodicity corrections given by our newly obtained kernel ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "section 5 gives a more detailed explanation of the relation between discrete space and periodic structures , casting the propagator in terms of continuous variables ( [ e103 ] ) .",
    "we end with a brief summary .",
    "let us start with the free schrdinger problem in discrete space and continuous time .",
    "we proceed by discretizing the derivative operator in the continuous wave equation .",
    "the corresponding wave function can be written as @xmath0 with @xmath1 an integer denoting a point in discrete space and @xmath2 a real parameter denoting time . introducing the constants @xmath3 ( with units of energy @xmath4 length@xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( lattice spacing ) ,",
    "the schrdinger dynamical problem is described by the equation    - = i [ e1 ] or , more concisely    -= i , [ e2 ] which is obtained under the appropriate rescaling of time @xmath7 and the transformation @xmath8 .",

    "is the existence of a phase , which shall prove to be of utmost importance in the analysis of feynman paths in further sections .",
    "the meaning of such a phase can be readily given by expressing ( [ e7 ] ) in polar form : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a discrete length between endpoints .",
    "by one stroke , we can give the propagator for @xmath14-dimensional lattices of the cubic type : let @xmath15 be vectors denoting points in the lattice .",

    "the fundamental properties of continuous propagators can be verified in the discrete case as well .",
    "it is instructive to see that some of the well - known identities of bessel functions have a meaning for our kernel .",

    "therefore we invoke the asympotitc form of bessel functions when both the argument and the index are large quantities ( see c. viii in @xcite ) .",
    "this is the so - called approximation by tangents @xcite , where the argument of @xmath30 is replaced by @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "the corrections are under control by recognizing that the approximation can be expressed as the first term of a series through meissel s second formula ( p. 227 in @xcite ) .",

    "the gauge factor @xmath38 is due to our simplification in the discretization of the second derivative ( the step leading to ( [ e2 ] ) from ( [ e1 ] ) ) , whereas the factor of @xmath6 is the infinitesimal length to be absorbed as a differential when we consider the summation of amplitudes , @xmath39 .",

    "these steps lead to + k(n , m;t ) ( i ) [ e15 ] which corresponds to the free propagator in continuous variables .",
    "it is amusing to see that the next order correction of meissel s expansion leads to the first corrections of the propagator due to discreteness in space ( or minimal length ) .",
    "this shall be investigated in the context of diffraction .",
    "now we investigate a formulation of discrete propagators leading to a summation over paths .",
    "the points to be touched upon are the existence of a phase associated to an action and a time - dependent weight function as in the usual feynman path integral @xcite .",
    "it is often pointed out that the original idea of composing propagators for small time intervals , comes from the fact that each propagator is a phase factor containing the classical action @xcite . in discrete problems , however , we do not have such a classical action and feynman s recipe can not be applied here straightforwardly .",
    "we recognize that the formalism of path integrals was designed to deal with problems in continuous space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we may employ the composition property of discrete propagators ( [ e11 ] ) in order to investigate the process of multiple compositions along an arbitrary number of time slices .",
    "denoting such a number as @xmath41 and defining @xmath42 , we can express our propagator as the sum of products    k(n , m;t ) & = & _ _ 1 ,  , _",

    "this expression is yet another representation of a bessel function which , to the author s knowledge , has not been investigated in the mathematical literature . we proceed to do so , by taking equal time intervals @xmath45 .",
    "we should note also that the kernel ( [ e7 ] ) is symmetric @xmath46 as a consequence of @xmath47 and of the inversion of the complex prefactor .",
    "then , it is legitimate to replace @xmath48 for each factor in the r.h.s . of ( [ e21 ] ) .",
