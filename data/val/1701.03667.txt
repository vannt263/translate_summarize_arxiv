    "silicene and germanene are topological insulators with nontrivial band gaps of 2 mev and 24 mev , respectively , induced by spin orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "the band gap can be controlled electrically by applying a gate voltage in the out - of - plane direction @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that both materials host quantum spin hall @xcite , quantum anomalous hall @xcite , and valley polarized quantum anomalous hall @xcite phases .",
    "silicene has been prepared on various substrates @xcite , while it is questionable whether it can exist in freestanding form ( which also applies to germanene ) .",
    "this is the reason why various theoretical results on the interaction with possible substrates are found in the literature , including the insulator @xmath1-bn @xcite , the semiconductor gaas @xcite , and the metals ca @xcite , ag @xcite , and ir @xcite .",
    "while on metallic substrates the dirac behavior of silicene typically is not maintained @xcite , transition metal dichalcogenides are characterized by a weak interaction @xcite . from a different perspective , the latter class of materials is receiving great interest in recent days due to the fact that it realizes band gaps in a technologically attractive range @xcite .",
    "transition metal dichalcogenides also have proven to be suitable hosts for graphene @xcite and it has been demonstrated that the soc of graphene can be enhanced by three orders of magnitude to about 17 mev on ws@xmath0 due to proximity effects @xcite .",
    "valleytronics is emerging as a new and exciting area of research , aiming to exploit the valley degree of freedom in dirac materials @xcite .",
    "an essential prerequisite of valleytronics , of course , is the availability of materials with valley polarization , i.e. , the energetical degeneracy of the valleys at the high symmetry k and k@xmath2 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone must be lifted . while this is difficult to realize in graphene , the stronger soc and buckled lattice of silicene / germanene provide an avenue to access and control the valley degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "spin and valley polarization can be achieved by means of doping and decoration with certain @xmath3 or @xmath4 transition metals @xcite as well as by an external electric field @xcite .",
    "however , interaction with the substrate is typically detrimental , because the electronic states are perturbed @xcite . besides the need to reduce the interaction with the substrate , it would be a great advantage if the substrate itself can be used to induce the required valley polarization , in order to reduce the complexity of the system . in this context , we show in the present work that proximity effects between silicene / germanene and ws@xmath0 can be utilized to obtain a suitable platform to explore spin and valley physics .",
    "we first discuss the band characteristics and spin splitting in silicene / germanene induced by the strong soc in ws@xmath0 and afterwards demonstrate that the spin polarization in f - doped ws@xmath0 generates spin - valley polarization .    : ( a ) top view and ( b ) side view.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we use the vienna ab - initio simulation package to perform first - principles calculations based on density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the exchange correlation potential is described in the generalized gradient approximation , using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof scheme , and the plane wave cutoff energy is set to a sufficiently large value of 475 ev .",
    "moreover , the soc is taken into account in all calculations and the van der waals interaction is incorporated using the dft - d3 method @xcite .",
    "the optimized lattice constants of silicene , germanene , and ws@xmath0 are 3.86  , 4.05  , and 3.18  . in order to reduce the lattice mismatch to 2.9% and 1.9% , respectively ,",
    "a @xmath5 supercells of silicene and germanene are placed on top of a @xmath6 supercell of ws@xmath0 .",
    "vacuum slabs of 15   thickness are used to obtain two - dimensional models . for the brillouin zone integration , monkhorst - pack @xmath7 and @xmath8 k - meshes",
    "are employed in the structure relaxations and band structure calculations , respectively .",
    "we achieve in each case at least an energy convergence of @xmath9 ev and an atomic force convergence of @xmath10 ev /  .",
    "the optimized crystal structure of silicene on top of monolayer ws@xmath0 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . a corresponding figure for germanene looks very similar and therefore is not shown . for different stackings of silicene",
    "/ germanene on top of ws@xmath0 ( different lateral shifts ) we obtain very small ( few mev ) total energy differences , showing that the materials can easily slide on each other .",
    "the distance between the two component materials turns out to be 3.13   in the case of silicene and 2.90 in the case of germanene .",
    "while the buckling of silicene is hardly affected by the interaction with ws@xmath0 ( 0.46  ) , it is slightly enhanced to 0.74   for germanene ( 0.65   in the freestanding case ) .",
    "the smaller interlayer distance and the enhancement of the buckling demonstrate that ws@xmath0 interacts more with germanene than with silicene , though the coupling is still weak . in order to quantify the interaction ,",
    "we calculate the binding energy @xmath11 , given by the total energies of the combined system , freestanding silicene / germanene , and freestanding monolayer ws@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 is the number of si / ge atoms .",
    "we obtain values of @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 mev for silicene and germanene , respectively , confirming our conclusion that the interaction is stronger in the latter case .      the electronic band structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] show that both silicene and germanene on ws@xmath0 maintain a linear dispersion of the @xmath15 bands in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "this is the case both when the soc is neglected and when it is taken into account . without soc we obtain band gaps of 29 mev and 38 mev , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a / c ) , for silicene and germanene on ws@xmath0 , respectively , which is comparable to the thermal energy at room temperature .",
    "the reason for the opening of a band gap is the broken inversion symmetry in the presence of ws@xmath0 .",
    "soc lifts the spin degeneracy at the k and k@xmath2 points and results in spin splittings of 8 mev and 32 mev in the valence band of silicene and germanene , respectively , and 3 mev and 19 mev in the conduction band , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b / d ) .",
    "the effect of the soc is enhanced in the presence of ws@xmath0 as a consequence of tiny hybridization between the si / ge @xmath16 and w @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "ws@xmath0 indeed is characterized by very strong soc , as reflected by spin splittings of 431 mev ( valence band ) and 29 mev ( conduction band ) in a freestanding monolayer @xcite .",
    "the enhancement mechanism by proximity soc is similar to the case of graphene on transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite , but due to the buckling of silicene / germanene the magnitude of spin splitting here is different in the valence and conduction bands . as a consequence of the lifted spin degeneracy , we obtain reduced band gaps of 23 mev and 14 mev for silicene and germanene on ws@xmath0 , respectively .      in the following",
    "we will argue that silicene / germanene on f - doped ws@xmath0 develops energetically inequivalent band edges at the k and k@xmath2 points , i.e. , spin - valley polarization .",
    "the advantage of doping the substrate instead of the electronically active material ( the material giving rise to the states close to the fermi energy ) is that impurity scattering is avoided .",
    "specifically , we replace one s atom in the @xmath6 supercell of ws@xmath0 with an f atom , corresponding to a doping concentration of 2% , in order to simulate the dilute doping limit .",
    "an earlier study has shown that substitutional f doping at the s site is possible in mos@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the binding energies @xmath18 and obtain values of 4.3 ev for x = f and 6.1 ev for x = s , where @xmath19 is the energy of a relaxed ws@xmath0 monolayer with one s vacancy , @xmath20 is the energy of an x atom , and @xmath21 is the energy of a relaxed ws@xmath0 monolayer with one s atom replaced by an x atom .",
    "since the binding energies of f and s are similar , it is likely that substitutional f doping at the s site is also possible in ws@xmath0 .",
    "experimental support for this conclusion comes from the realization of p doping in mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 @xcite and cl doping in mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 @xcite . by comparing spin degenerate and polarized calculations for the doped supercell",
    ", we obtain an energy gain of 134 mev in the spin polarized case and a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 .",
    "next to the f atom the charge transfer from the three neighbouring w atoms is reduced from two electrons to one electron ( f@xmath23 state instead of s@xmath24 state ) .",
    "the remaining electron is located on one of the three w atoms and gives rise to the spatial distribution of spin density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",

    "this fact can be attributed to the additional magnetic coupling .",
    "a comparison of the interaction in the cases of pristine and f - doped ws@xmath0 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] in terms of charge density difference plots .",
    "while the charge redistribution in the van der waals gap is only slightly modified after f doping , compare the top to the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the dopant atom is strongly affected , supporting the idea of magnetic coupling .",
    "we obtain still a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 , carried largely by one w atom .",
    "this atom realizes a larger distance ( 2.70  ) to the f atom than the other two neighbouring w atoms ( 2.30  ) , very similar to the situation without silicene / germanene .",
    "in addition , the f magnetic moment is reduced to @xmath27 @xmath22 .",
    "the band structure of silicene / germanene shows significant alterations in contact with f - doped ws@xmath0 , see fig .",

    "the spin splitting in the valence band is enhanced to 36/91 mev and that in the conduction band to 25/9 mev .",

    "the valley polarization here amounts to 28 mev and 16 mev for the germanene valence and conduction bands , respectively , which opens a route to spin - valley polarization even at room temperature . in order to demonstrate that the k and k@xmath2 valleys are virtually not affected by the symmetry breaking in f - doped ws@xmath0 ,",

    "we also have checked that the spin hybridization at the valleys is negligible . moreover , while the f impurity band is located next to the fermi energy , the f states are spatially separated from the si / ge states and therefore do not limit exploitation of the spin - valley polarization .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that silicene and germanene in proximity to monolayer ws@xmath0 develop sizeable band gaps ( due to inversion symmetry breaking ) and spin splittings ( due to proximity soc ) .",
