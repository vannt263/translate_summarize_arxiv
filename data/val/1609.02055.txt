    "there has been considerable recent interest in smms since they all have , in contrast to , e.g. , nanoparticles , identical properties , which is an important advantage for the realization of scalable ensembles of quantum computation entities .",
    "antiferromagnetic triangular molecules @xcite are a special class of smms particularly suitable for quantum control and manipulation . due to the lack of inversion symmetry , smms display an effective spin - electric coupling mechanism @xcite acting within their quasi - degenerate chiral ground state .",

    "we show that in a triangular antiferromagnetic smm subject to a time - dependent external electric field , the spin - electric coupling induces a berry phase in the spin - chiral ground state manifold .",
    "we use applied electric field pulses in the presence of a static magnetic field to realize a conditional dynamics of the system .",
    "we show that berry phases with arbitrary values between 0 to @xmath0 on the chiral degree of freedom ( chiral qubit ) can be achieved by adiabatically varying the electric field in the plane of the molecule , and can be measured by using spin echo technique .",
    "the berry phase shift depends on the effective spin - orbit interaction and electric dipole moment of the smm , which are the two most important quantities that control the spin - electric coupling mechanism . in the adiabatic limit",
    ", the ratio of these two quantities can be determined by measuring the berry phase shift as a function of the electric field amplitude .",
    "the berry phase can be used to implement a phase - shift gate , with an arbitrary phase , acting on the chiral part of the ground state manifold of the triangular smm , which encodes a single chiral qubit .",

    "this can be achieved by using a technique known as _ spin - echo _ @xcite . in this procedure , we apply the cyclic evolution @xmath69 combined with fast @xmath0 transformations , which simply flip the spin or chiral basis states by applying in the molecular plane a pulsed magnetic or electric field , respectively .",
    "explicitly , we let the system evolve through the following compound evolution @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is a fast spin ( chiral ) flip transformation , and the path @xmath87 in parameter space is the same as @xmath69 described above , but in the reverse direction .",
    "the net effect of this compound transformation would be that the dynamical phases are all cancelled out and we are only left with geometric phase factors .",
    "thus , the net unitary transformation is given by @xmath88 purely dependent on the berry phase shift @xmath89 and acting nontrivially only on the chiral degree of freedom .",
    "this follows from the fact that the cyclic adiabatic evolution in opposite directions induce the same dynamical phases but berry phases with opposite signs .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath90 can be viewed as a geometric phase - shift gate @xcite @xmath91 acting on a chiral qubit encoded in the ground state manifold of the smm .     as a function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath46 is the angular frequency of the applied electric field , @xmath35 is the strength of the spin - electric coupling , @xmath48 is the applied field amplitude , and @xmath94 is the zero - field energy splitting of the chiral states.,width=309,height=200 ]    figure [ fig : phase - shift ] shows that by careful control of electric field amplitude any berry phase shift associated with the chiral qubit can be realized .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath95 is a lorentzian shaped phase shift with no local extrema and is independent of the applied external magnetic field . in the adiabatic limit @xmath96",
    ", we obtain @xmath97 which establishes a fundamental relation between three quantities : berry phase @xmath95 , the strength of the spin - electric coupling @xmath35 , and the zero - field energy splitting @xmath94 .    the relation in eq .",
    "( [ abp ] ) provides in principle a method for obtaining an estimate of the ratio @xmath98 of the two primary intrinsic quantities regulating the spin - electric coupling mechanism in these smms . by measuring the geometric berry phase @xmath95 as a function of the external electric field amplitude @xmath48",
    ", the ratio can be evaluated .",
    "the geometric phase can be measured interferometrically , by cancelling the dynamical phases picked up along different interference pathways . in the smm case ,",
    "one may measure the berry phase @xmath95 by using a spin - echo interference setting , where the spin degree of freedom plays the role of the interferometer arms .",
    "one way to realize this would be to initialize the interferometer in an eigenstate of @xmath99 with , e.g. , a short @xmath100 electric field pulse applied in the plane of the molecule .",
    "the system subsequently evolves through the spin echo compound evolution @xmath101 described above , by carefully controlling the external fields .",
    "right after completing the spin echo sequence , another @xmath100 electric field pulse is applied followed by measuring the chirality of the output .",
    "one finds the probabilities @xmath102 from which the berry phase shift can be extracted .",
    "a direct measurement of the chirality in these smms is a non - trivial task .",
    "however , as it was pointed by khomskii _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the chiral gs states are characterized by the presence of spontaneous orbital currents , giving rise to magnetic orbital moments proportional to the chirality .",
    "therefore it is in principle possbile to determine the state chirality by carrying out a measure of the orbital moment via , e.g. , stern - gerlach - type experiments .",
    "we conclude this section with two remarks on the effect of the external magnetic field .",
    "first , we note that in the conditional chiral spin dynamics described above , a static magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the smm plays only the passive role of splitting the two chiral components with opposite spin quantum numbers .",
    "importantly , in creating ensembles of solid - state molecular spin qubits this function of the magnetic field is one possible solution to the unwanted long - range magnetic dipolar interaction , which is one of the strongest source of decoherence in crystals of quantum molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "however , a large magnetic field also renders coherent manipulations of spin qubits unpractical @xcite . in our case",
    "this is not an issue , since the chiral qubits of a triangular smm are entirely manipulated by the electric field , while a constant magnetic field is still used to freeze out one of the two spin components .",
    "the second remark concerns the effect of a component of a constant magnetic field in the plane of the molecule .",
    "when this is present , spin - up and spin - down states are coupled by the transverse field @xmath103 . nevertheless , if @xmath104 , then the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian are still of predominant spin character , with a small admixture of the opposite spin contribution .",
    "when a time - dependent field is applied , we can imagine repeating the same analysis of the chiral state dynamics induced by the spin - electric coupling .",
    "now , however , since the states are no longer pure spin state , the electric field couples chiral states of opposite chirality and predominately opposite spin . using two states of opposite chirality and opposite spin to encode a qubit has the advantage that transitions between them can be more easily read out via a detection of the spin flip@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the berry phase effect in the system of triangular antiferromagnetic single - molecule magnets ( smm ) .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of a berry phase associated with the chiral degree of freedom ( chiral qubit ) of the system that can be measured by using spin - echo techniques .",
    "we show that a nontrivial berry phase shift can be realized even with an in - plane external field , due to the presence of a spin - orbit term that couples the chiral and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we have derived a unifying relation between the berry phase , as a function of electric field and the two primary intrinsic quantities in the smm being the spin - orbit coupling strength and the electric dipole moment . in this way",
    ", the ratio between these quantities can be estimated by measuring the berry phase shift on the chiral degree of freedom .",
    "furthermore , by considering the two chiral states as defining a qubit embedded in the ground state manifold of the triangular smm , the berry phase effect can be interpreted as a single - qubit geometric phase shift gate .",
    "moreover , the research of this paper provide an experimental testbed for exploring the physical nature of the berry s phase effect in solid state systems .",
    "we have confined ourselves to the study of the chiral dynamics of _ isolated _ triangular smms .",
    "an experimental realization of the effect studied in this paper could possibly involve the functionalization of the smms onto an appropriate surface / substrate , which are then electrically addressed by a nearby stm tip and electric gates .",
    "the choice of the surface is crucial .",
    "first of all the @xmath105 symmetry of the molecule has to be preserved in such a way that the simple theoretical model discussed above is applicable .",
    "graphene and boron nitride are both substrates that display the correct crystal symmetry .",
    "secondly , unwanted charge - transfer effects between molecule and substrate that would mask and complicate the realization of the spin - electric coupling must be avoided or controlled .",
    "this is in fact a challenging task .",
    "ongoing first - principles calculations @xcite of cu@xmath36 and v@xmath36 smms on graphene and boron nitride substrates can provide useful hints on the effect of the environment on the chiral gs manifold and the spin - electric coupling in these antiferromagnetic triangular molecular magnets .",
