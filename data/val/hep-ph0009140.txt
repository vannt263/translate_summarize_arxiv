    "in theories , there is no clear theoretical argument in favor of the conservation of the so - called r - parity symmetry , either from the point of view of grand unified models , string theories or scenarios with discrete gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of ( susy ) at futur colliders would change fundamentally if the r - parity symmetry were violated .",
    "indeed , in such a scenario the typical missing energy signature caused by the stable nature of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) would be replaced by multijet or multileptonic signals , depending on what are the dominant r - parity violating ( ) couplings .",
    "the reason is that the terms of the superpotential trilinear in the quarks and leptons superfields ( see eq.([super ] ) ) allow the lsp , whatever it is , to decay . @xmath9",
    "the effects of the decays of the lsp on the study of susy particles pair production have been considered in the context of linear colliders @xcite and futur hadronic colliders , namely the tevatron ( run ii ) @xcite and the lhc @xcite .",
    "the measure of the coupling constants of eq.([super ] ) could be performed via the detection of the displaced vertex associated to the decay of the lsp .",
    "the sensitivities on the couplings obtained through this method depend on the detector geometry and performances .",
    "let us estimate the largest values of the coupling constants that can be measured via the displaced vertex analysis .",
    "we suppose that the lsp is the lightest neutralino ( @xmath10 ) . the flight length of the lsp in the laboratory frame is then given in meters by @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 is the light speed , @xmath16 the lorentz boost factor , @xmath17 the lsp life time , @xmath18 the lsp mass and @xmath19 the mass of the supersymmetric scalar particle involved in the three - body decay of the lsp .",
    "since the displaced vertex analysis is an experimental challenge at hadronic colliders , we consider here the linear colliders . assuming that the minimum distance between two vertex necessary to distinguish them experimentally is of order @xmath20 at linear colliders , we see from eq.([fleng ] ) that the couplings could be measured up to the values , @xmath21 there is a gap between these values and the low - energy experimental constraints on the couplings which range typically in the interval @xmath22 for superpartners masses of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , the domain lying between these low - energy bounds and the values of eq.([lsp ] ) can be tested through another way : the study of the production of either or susy particles involving couplings .",
    "indeed , the cross sections of such productions are directly proportional to a power of the relevant coupling constant(s ) , which allows to determine the values of the couplings .",
    "therefore , there exists a complementarity between the displaced vertex analysis and the study of reactions involving couplings , since these two methods allow to investigate different ranges of values of the coupling constants .",
    "the studies of the contributions to particle productions have been performed both at leptonic @xcite-@xcite and hadronic @xcite-@xcite colliders .",
    "those contributions generally involve two vertex and have thus some rates proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "the processes involving only one vertex are less suppressed since the couplings incur stringent experimental limits @xcite .",
    "those reactions correspond to the single production of particle .",
    "another interest of the single superpartner production is the possibility to produce susy particles at lower energies than through the superpartner pair production , which is the favored reaction in r - parity conserved models .    at hadronic colliders ,",
    "the single superpartner production involves either @xmath13 or @xmath14 @xcite . the test of the @xmath25 couplings via the single superpartner production",
    "can only be performed at leptonic colliders . at leptonic colliders , either gaugino ( not including gluino ) @xcite or slepton ( charged or neutral )",
    "@xcite can be singly produced in the simple @xmath26 reactions .",
    "the single production of slepton has a reduced phase space , since the slepton is produced together with a @xmath27 or @xmath28 gauge boson .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath10 is produced together with a neutrino .",
    "nevertheless , if the @xmath10 is the lsp , as in many scenarios , it undergoes an decay which reads as @xmath29 if one assumes a dominant @xmath25 yukawa coupling .",
    "therefore , the single @xmath10 production leads typically to the @xmath30 final state which has a large background . in this paper , we focus on the single chargino production @xmath31 , which occurs through the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 )",
    ". there are several motivations .",
    "first , the single chargino production has an higher cross section than the single neutralino production @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can lead to particularly interesting multileptonic signatures due to the cascade decay initiated by the chargino .",
    "the single gaugino productions at @xmath35 colliders have @xmath36 and @xmath37 channels and can also receive a contribution from the resonant sneutrino production . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the off - resonance rates of the single chargino and neutralino productions are typically of order @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively @xcite , for a value of the relevant equal to its low - enery bound for @xmath41 : @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the off - pole effects of the single gaugino production are thus at the limit of observability at lep ii assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath43 . at the sneutrino resonance ,",
    "the single gaugino production has higher cross section values .",
    "for instance with @xmath44 , the chargino production rate can reach @xmath45 at the resonance @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why the experimental analysis of the single gaugino production at the lep collider @xcite allows to test couplings values smaller than the low - energy bounds only at the sneutrino resonance @xmath46 and , due to the initial state radiation ( isr ) effect , in a range of typically @xmath47 around the @xmath6 pole .",
    "the sensitivities on the @xmath32 couplings obtained at lep reach values of order @xmath48 at the sneutrino resonance",
    ".    the experimental analysis of the single gaugino production at futur linear colliders should be interesting due to the high luminosities and energies expected at these futur colliders @xcite .",
    "however , the single gaugino production might suffer a large susy background at linear colliders .",
    "indeed , due to the high energies reached at these colliders , the pair productions of susy particles may have important cross sections .    in this article , we study the single chargino production via the @xmath1 coupling at linear colliders and we consider the final state containing 4 leptons plus some missing energy ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we show that the susy background can be greatly reduced with respect to the signal .",
    "this discrimination is based on the two following points : first , the susy background can be suppressed by making use of the beam polarization capability of the linear colliders .",
    "secondly , the specific kinematics of the single chargino production reaction allows to put some efficient cuts on the transverse momentum of the lepton produced together with the chargino .",
    "we find that , by consequence of this background reduction , the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling obtained at the @xmath6 resonance at linear colliders for @xmath2 and @xmath50 @xcite would be of order @xmath51 , namely one order of magnitude better than the results of the lep analysis @xcite , assuming the largest supersymmetric background allowed by the experimental limits on the susy masses .",
    "besides , in the scenario of a single dominant coupling of type @xmath25 with @xmath10 as the lsp , the experimental superpartner mass reconstruction from the susy particle pair production suffers an high combinatorial background both at linear colliders @xcite and lhc @xcite .",
    "the reason is that all the masses reconstructions are based on the @xmath10 reconstruction which is degraded by the imperfect identification of the charged leptons generated in the decays of the 2 neutralinos as @xmath29 , and the presence of missing energy in the final state . in particular ,",
    "the chargino mass reconstruction in the leptonic channel is difficult since the presence of an additional neutrino , coming from the decay @xmath52 , renders the control on the missing energy more challenging . in this paper , we show that through the study of the @xmath53 final state , the specific kinematics of the single chargino production reaction at linear colliders allows to determine the @xmath54 and @xmath6 masses .    in section [ frame ]",
    "we define the theoretical framework . in sections [ signal ] and [ background ]",
    "we describe the signal and the several backgrounds . in section",
    "[ an ] , we present the sensitivity on the susy parameters that can be obtained in an @xmath35 machine allowing an initial beam polarization . in this last section , we also show how some information on the susy mass spectrum can be derived from the study of the single chargino production , and we comment on another kind of signature : the @xmath55 final state .",
    "we work within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) which has the minimal particle content and the minimal gauge group @xmath56 , namely the gauge symmetry .",
    "the parameters defined at the electroweak scale are the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath57 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublet fields @xmath58 and the soft susy breaking parameters , namely the bino ( @xmath59 ) mass @xmath60 , the wino ( @xmath61 ) mass @xmath62 , the gluino ( @xmath63 ) mass @xmath64 , the sfermion masses @xmath65 and the trilinear yukawa couplings @xmath66 .",
    "the remaining three parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and the soft susy breaking bilinear coupling @xmath69 are determined through the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions , which are two necessary minimization conditions of the higgs potential .",
    "we assume that all phases in the soft susy breaking potential are equal to zero in order to eliminate all new sources of cp violation which are constrained by extremely tight experimental limits on the electron and neutron electric moments . furthermore , to avoid any problem of flavor changing neutral currents , we take the matrices in flavor space of the sfermion masses and @xmath66 couplings close to the unit matrix . in particular , for simplification reason we consider vanishing @xmath66 couplings .",
    "this last assumption concerns the splitting between the left and right sfermions masses and does not affect our analysis which depends mainly on the relative values of the sleptons , squarks and gauginos masses as we will discuss in next sections .    besides",
    ", we suppose the r - parity symmetry to be violated so that the interactions written in the superpotential of eq.([super ] ) are present .",
    "the existence of a hierarchy among the values of the couplings is suggested by the analogy of those couplings with the yukawa couplings .",
    "we thus assume a single dominant coupling of the type @xmath32 which allows the single chargino production at @xmath70 colliders .    finally , we choose the lsp to be the @xmath71 neutralino since it is often real in many models , such as the supergravity inspired models .",
    "the single chargino production @xmath31 occurs via the @xmath32 coupling constant either through the exchange of a @xmath72 sneutrino in the @xmath73 channel or a @xmath74 sneutrino in the @xmath36 channel ( see fig.[graphe ] ) . due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath75 yukawa couplings in the @xmath76 and @xmath77 indices , only a muon or a tau - lepton",
    "can be produced together with the chargino , namely @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the produced chargino can decay into the lsp as @xmath78 or as @xmath79 .",
    "then the lsp decays as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 or @xmath83 through @xmath32 .",
    "each of these 4 @xmath84 decay channels has a branching ratio exactly equal to @xmath85 . in this paper , we study the @xmath86 final state generated by the decay @xmath78 of the produced chargino .",
    "the single chargino production has a specific feature which is particularly attractive : because of the simple kinematics of @xmath87 type reaction , the energy of the lepton produced with the chargino , which we write @xmath88 , is completely fixed by the center of mass energy @xmath89 , the lepton mass @xmath90 and the chargino mass @xmath91 : @xmath92 the lepton momentum @xmath93 , which is related to the lepton energy by @xmath94 , is thus also fixed . therefore , the momentum distribution of the produced lepton is peaked and offers the opportunity to put some cuts allowing an effective discrimination between the signal and the several backgrounds .",
    "besides , the momentum value of the produced lepton gives the @xmath95 mass through eq.([enl ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , for a significant isr effect the radiated photon carries a non negligible energy and the single chargino production must be treated as a three - body reaction of the type @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the energy of the produced lepton is not fixed anymore by the susy parameters . as we will show in section [ kin ] , in this situation",
    "the transverse momentum of the produced lepton is more appropriate to apply some cuts and reconstruct the @xmath95 mass .",
    "+ in the case where the produced lepton is a tau , the momentum of the lepton ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) coming from the @xmath17-decay is of course not peaked at a given value .",
    "moreover , in contrast with the muon momentum , the precise determination of the tau - lepton momentum is difficult experimentally due to the unstable nature of the @xmath17 . from this point of view , the case of a single dominant @xmath1 coupling constant is a more promising scenario than the situation in which @xmath99 is the dominant coupling .",
    "hence , from now on we focus on the single dominant coupling @xmath1 and consider the single chargino production @xmath0 .    at this stage",
    ", an important remark can be made concerning the initial state . as can be seen from fig.[graphe ] , in the single @xmath100 production the initial electron and positron have the same helicity , namely , they are both left - handed .",
    "similarly in the @xmath101 production , the electron and the positron are both right - handed .",
    "the incoming lepton and anti - lepton have thus in any case the same helicity .",
    "this is due to the particular structure of the trilinear couplings which flips the chirality of the fermion .",
    "the incoming electron and positron could also have identical helicities .",
    "however , this contribution involves the higgsino component of the chargino and is thus suppressed by the coupling of the higgsino to leptons which is proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "this same helicity property , which is characteristic of all type of single superpartner production at leptonic colliders @xcite , allows to increase the single chargino production rate by selecting same helicities initial leptons .",
    "first , one has to consider the non - physic background for the @xmath103 signature .",
    "the main source of such a background is the @xmath27-boson pair production with isr .",
    "indeed , the isr photons have an high probability to be colinear to the beam axis .",
    "they will thus often be missed experimentally becoming then a source of missing energy .",
    "the four leptons can come from the leptonic decays of the 2 @xmath27-bosons .",
    "this background can be greatly reduced by excluding the same flavor opposite - sign dileptons which have an invariant mass in the range , @xmath104 , @xmath105 being the generation indice .",
    "furthermore , the missing energy coming from the isr is mainly present at small angles with respect to the beam axis .",
    "this point can be exploited to perform a better selection of the signal . as a matter of fact , the missing energy coming from the signal has a significant transverse component since it is caused by the presence of neutrinos in the final state . in fig.[distrib ] , we present the distribution of the transverse missing energy in the @xmath106 events generated by the single @xmath107 production for a sneutrino mass of @xmath108 and for the point a of the susy parameter space defined as : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) .",
    "the cut on the lepton momentum mentioned in section [ signal ] can also enhance the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "finally , the beam polarization may be useful in reducing this source of background .",
    "indeed , the initial leptons in the @xmath118 production process have opposite helicities .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath119 vertex conserves the fermion chirality .",
    "furthermore , recall that in our signal , the initial electron and positron have similar helicities .",
    "thus if the beam polarization at linear collider were chosen in order to favor opposite helicities initial states , the signal would be enhanced while the @xmath118 background would be suppressed . since the polarization expected at linear colliders is of order @xmath120 for the electron and @xmath121 for the positron @xcite , the @xmath118 background would not be entirely eliminated by the beam polarization effect .      the backgrounds for the @xmath86 signal come from @xmath122 processes .",
    "for example , the @xmath123 reaction can give rise to the four leptons plus missing energy signature .",
    "another source of background is the @xmath124 reaction .",
    "the rates for those backgrounds have been calculated in @xcite after the cuts on the charged lepton rapidity , @xmath125 , the charged lepton transverse momentum , @xmath126 , and the missing transverse energy , @xmath127 , have been applied .",
    "the results are the followings .",
    "the @xmath128 production cross section does not exceed @xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath130 production has a cross section of @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath2 ( @xmath133 ) after convoluting with the branching fractions for the leptonic decays of the gauge bosons .",
    "this rate value is obtained without the isr effect which should reduce the cross section of the @xmath130 production dominated by the @xmath36 channel exchange contribution @xcite .",
    "as before , the @xmath130 production can be reduced using simultaneously the cut on the lepton momentum indicated in section [ signal ] , the dilepton invariant mass cut and the beam polarization effect .",
    "indeed , the initial leptons have opposite helicities in both the @xmath73 and @xmath36 channels of the process @xmath134 , as in the @xmath118 production process .",
    "the main sources of background to the @xmath135 signature are the neutralinos and sneutrinos pair productions .",
    "first , the reaction , @xmath136 represents a background for the @xmath53 signature since the @xmath10 , which is the lsp in our framework , decays as @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 or @xmath140 through the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "therefore , the @xmath141 productions ( where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are not equal to @xmath144 simultaneously ) leading through cascade decays to a pair of @xmath10 accompanied by some neutrinos give also rise to the final state with 4 leptons plus some missing energy .",
    "these reactions are the following , @xmath145 @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 . besides",
    ", the pair productions of neutralinos followed by their decays through @xmath1 : @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 where @xmath147 , are also a source of background .    secondly , the @xmath53 signature can arise in the sneutrino pair production through the reactions , @xmath152 where @xmath153 , if the produced neutralinos decay as above , namely either as @xmath154 ( if @xmath155 ) or as @xmath156 .",
    "the neutralinos and sneutrinos pair productions also lead to the @xmath53 final state via more complex cascade decays such as @xmath157 ( @xmath147 and @xmath158 ) or @xmath159 where the chargino decays through the @xmath1 coupling .    at the high energies available at linear colliders @xcite , the rates of the neutralinos and sneutrinos pair productions ( see section [ susyx ] ) are typically quite larger than the cross sections of the background reactions ( see section [ smback ] ) .",
    "we however note that in the regions of large @xmath160 and @xmath161 masses with respect to the center of mass energy @xmath89 , the @xmath141 and @xmath162 productions cross sections , respectively , are suppressed by the phase space factor . in the kinematic domain @xmath163 ( @xmath142 and @xmath105 ) , all the neutralinos and sneutrinos pair productions are even kinematically closed while the single chargino production remains possible .",
    "in such a situation , the only background to the @xmath53 final state would be the background so that the sensitivity on the @xmath164 coupling would be greatly improved .",
    "nevertheless , the kinematic domain described above is restrictive and not particularly motivated . as a conclusion , except in some particular kinematic domains ,",
    "the main background to the @xmath53 final state is supersymmetric .",
    "+ in section [ an ] , we will focus on the largest allowed susy background . indeed",
    ", the various considered domains of the susy parameter space will be chosen such that the @xmath10 mass is around the value @xmath165 which is close to the experimental limit @xmath166 ( for @xmath167 and any @xmath75 coupling ) @xcite in order to maximize the phase space factors of the @xmath168 productions and the decays @xmath169 .",
    "the susy background could be suppressed by the cut on the lepton momentum mentioned in section [ signal ] .",
    "the selection of initial leptons of same helicities would also reduce the susy background .",
    "indeed , the neutralino ( sneutrino ) pair production occurs through the exchange of either a @xmath27-boson in the @xmath73 channel or a charged slepton ( chargino ) in the @xmath36 channel , and the helicities of the initial electron and positron are opposite in all those channels .",
    "the @xmath36 channels of the susy background processes allow however same helicity leptons in the initial state but this contribution entails the higgsino component of the relevant gaugino and is thus suppressed by powers of @xmath170 .",
    "in this part , we determine the sensitivity on the @xmath1 expected from the study of the single chargino production @xmath171 based on the analysis of the @xmath53 final state at linear colliders , assuming a center of mass energy of @xmath2 and a luminosity of @xmath3 . for this purpose , we study the susy background and show how it can be reduced with respect to the signal . at the end of this part , we also discuss the determination of the @xmath107 , @xmath172 and @xmath6 masses , the single chargino production at different center of mass energies and via other couplings , the @xmath173 final state and the single neutralino production .",
    "we have simulated the signal and the background with the new version of the susygen event generator @xcite including the beam polarization effects .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio could be enhanced by making use of the capability of the linear colliders to polarize the inital beams .",
    "first , as we have seen in section [ susyb ] the susy background would be reduced if initial leptons of similar helicities were selected .",
    "hence , we consider in this study the selection of the @xmath174 initial state , namely left - handed initial electron and positron . in order to illustrate the effect of this polarization on the susy background ,",
    "let us consider for example the @xmath175 production .",
    "at the point a of the susy parameter space , the unpolarized cross section is @xmath176 for a center of mass energy of @xmath2 .",
    "selecting now the @xmath174 initial beams and assuming a value of @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) for the electron ( positron ) polarization , the production rate becomes @xmath177 .",
    "secondly , the selection of same helicities initial leptons would increase the signal rate as mentioned in section [ signal ] .",
    "we discuss here the effect of the considered @xmath174 beam polarization on the signal rate . as explained in section [ signal ] , the single chargino production occurs through the process @xmath178 ( see fig.[graphe ] ) or through its charge conjugated process @xmath179 .",
    "these charge conjugated processes have the same cross section : @xmath180 .",
    "the whole cross section is thus @xmath181 / 4 = \\sigma(e^-_l e^+_l \\to \\tilde \\chi^-_1 \\mu^+ ) / 2 $ ] .",
    "the chosen beam polarization favoring left - handed initial leptons , only the process @xmath178 would be selected if the polarization were total .",
    "the polarized cross section would then be @xmath182 .",
    "hence , the signal would be increased by a factor of @xmath183 with respect to the whole cross section .",
    "in fact , due to the limited expected efficiency of the beam polarization , the chargino production can also receive a small contribution from the process @xmath179 .",
    "the polarized cross section is thus replaced by @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 , @xmath187 being for example the probability to have a left - handed initial positron . assuming a polarization efficiency of @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) for the electron ( positron ) and selecting left - handed initial leptons , the probabilities are @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "hence , the polarized cross section reads as @xmath192\\sigma(e^-_l e^+_l \\to \\tilde \\chi^-_1 \\mu^+)= 0.755 \\",
    "\\sigma(e^-_l e^+_l \\to \\tilde \\chi^-_1 \\mu^+)=1.51 \\ \\sigma$ ] .",
    "the signal rate is thus enhanced by a factor of @xmath193 with respect to the whole cross section if the @xmath174 beam polarization is applied .",
    "the single @xmath107 chargino production has a cross section typically of order @xmath194 at @xmath2 for @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "the single @xmath107 production rate is reduced in the higgsino dominated region @xmath196 where the @xmath107 is dominated by its higgsino component , compared to the wino dominated domain @xmath197 in which the @xmath107 is mainly composed by the charged higgsino @xcite . besides , the single @xmath107 production cross section depends weakly on the sign of the @xmath57 parameter at large values of @xmath198 .",
    "however , as @xmath198 decreases the rate increases ( decreases ) for @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "this evolution of the rate with the @xmath198 and @xmath201 parameters is explained by the evolution of the @xmath107 mass in the susy parameter space @xcite . finally , when the sneutrino mass approaches the resonance ( @xmath202 ) by lower values",
    ", the single @xmath107 production cross section is considerably increased due to the isr effect @xcite .",
    "for instance , at the point a of the susy parameter space , the rate is equal to @xmath203 for a center of mass energy of @xmath2 and a sneutrino mass of @xmath108 . at the resonance ,",
    "the single chargino production rate reaches high values .",
    "for example at @xmath204 , the cross section is @xmath205 for the same mssm point a.    since we consider the @xmath206 final state and the chargino width is neglected , the single chargino production rate must be multiplied by the branching ratio of the leptonic chargino decay @xmath207 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the leptonic decay of the chargino is typically of order @xmath208 for @xmath209 .",
    "this leptonic decay is suppressed compared to the hadronic decay @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) because of the color factor .",
    "indeed for @xmath212 the hadronic decay is typically @xmath213 ( @xmath211 ) . in the case where @xmath214 , the decay @xmath215 occurs through the two - body decays @xmath216 and @xmath217 and is thus the dominant channel .",
    "in such a scenario , the branching ratio of the @xmath206 final state for the single @xmath7 production is close to @xmath218 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath219 , the decay @xmath210 dominates , as it occurs through the two - body decay @xmath220 , and the signal is negligible .",
    "the decays of the chargino via @xmath1 , @xmath221 , have generally negligible branching fractions due to the small values of the coupling constants .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of nearly degenerate @xmath107 and @xmath10 masses , those decays can become dominant spoiling then the @xmath206 signature .",
    "in this part , we discuss the variations and the order of magnitude of the cross sections and branching ratios on which the whole susy background depends .",
    "@xmath222 * neutralino pair production * the neutralinos pair productions represent a susy background for the present study of the r - parity violation .",
    "a detailed description of the neutralinos pair productions cross sections at linear colliders for an energy of @xmath2 has recently been performed in @xcite . in order to consider in our analysis the main variations of the neutralinos pair productions rates , we have generated all the @xmath141 productions ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 both varying between @xmath144 and @xmath223 ) at some points belonging to characteristic regions of the mssm parameter space .",

    "first , we select the events without jets containing 4 charged leptons and missing energy . in order to take into account the observability of leptons at a @xmath352 machine",
    ", we apply the following cuts on the transverse momentum and rapidity of all the charged leptons : @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
    "this should simulate the detector acceptance effects in a first approximation . in order to reduce the background",
    ", we also demand that the number of muons is at least equal to one .",
    "since we consider the @xmath355 production , this does not affect the signal .",
    "we now discuss in details the most important cut concerning the momentum of the muon which is produced together with the chargino . for a negligible isr effect ,",
    "this muon momentum is completely determined by the values of the chargino mass and the center of mass energy through eq.([enl ] ) , as explained in section [ signal ] .",
    "hence , some cuts on the muon momentum should be efficient to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio since the muon momentum distribution is perfectly peaked at a given value .",
    "+ for a significant isr effect , the energy of the photon generated via the isr must be taken into account .",
    "hence , the muon energy @xmath356 must be calculated through the three - body kinematics of the reaction @xmath357 . since this kinematics depends on the angle between the muon and the photon ,",
    "the muon energy @xmath356 is not completely fixed by the susy parameters anymore .",
    "therefore , the distribution obtained experimentally of the muon momentum @xmath358 would appear as a peaked curve instead of a dirac peak . although the momentum of the produced muon remains a good selection criteria , we have found that in this case the transverse momentum distribution of the produced muon was more peaked , and thus more appropriate to apply some cuts .",
    "we explain the reasons why in details below .",
    "+ we have thus chosen to apply cuts on the distribution of the muon transverse momentum instead of the whole muon momentum , even if for a negligible isr effect the transverse momentum distribution is not peaked as well as the whole momentum distribution .",
    "the amplitude of the isr effect depends on the susy mass spectrum as we will discuss below .",
    "+ the cuts on the muon transverse momentum have been applied on the muon with the highest transverse momentum which can be identified as the muon produced together with the chargino in the case of the signal .",
    "indeed , the muon produced together with the chargino is typically more energetic than the 3 other leptons generated in the chargino cascade decay .",
    "we will come back on this point later .    in fig.[isr ] , we show the distribution of the highest muon transverse momentum @xmath359 in the @xmath86 events generated by the single @xmath107 production and the susy background at @xmath360 for the point a of the susy parameter space with @xmath195 and @xmath361 .",

    "the number of @xmath86 events for each of those 3 susy backgrounds and the single chargino production has been normalized to the unity .",
    "our motivation for such a normalization is that the relative amplitudes of the 3 susy backgrounds and the single chargino production , which depend strongly on the susy parameters , were discussed in detail in sections [ signalx ] and [ susyx ] , and in this section we focus on the shapes of the various distributions .",
    "+ we see in the highest muon transverse momentum distribution of fig.[isr ] that , as expected , a characteristic peak arises for the single chargino production .",
    "therefore , some cuts on the highest muon transverse momentum @xmath359 would greatly increase the signal with respect to the backgrounds .",
    "for instance , the selection criteria suggested by the fig.[isr ] are something like @xmath367",
    ". we can also observe in fig.[isr ] that the distributions of the @xmath314 and @xmath162 productions are concentrated at lower transverse momentum values than the @xmath261 distribution .",
    "this is due to the energy carried away by the neutrinos in the cascade decays of the reactions ( [ chi2 ] ) , ( [ chi3 ] ) , ( [ chrp2 ] ) and ( [ sneu ] ) .",
    "the main variation of the highest muon transverse momentum distributions of the susy backgrounds with the susy parameters is the following : the susy backgrounds distributions spread to larger values of the muon transverse momentum as the @xmath10 mass increases , since then the charged leptons coming from the decay @xmath29 reach higher energies .",
    "+ fig.[isr ] shows also clearly that the peak in the transverse momentum distribution of the muon produced with the chargino exhibits an upper limit which we note @xmath368 .",
    "this bound @xmath368 is a kinematic limit and thus its value depends on the susy masses .",
    "the consequence on our analysis is that the cuts on the muon transverse momentum are modified as the susy mass spectrum is changing .",
    "note that the kinematic limit of the whole muon momentum depends also on the susy masses , so that our choice of working with the transverse momentum remains judicious . for a better understanding of the analysis and in view of the study on the susy mass spectrum of section [ marec ]",
    ", we now determine the value of the muon transverse momentum kinematic limit @xmath368 as a function of the susy parameters . for this purpose",
    "we divide the discussion into 2 scenarios .",
    "first , we consider the situation where @xmath369 and @xmath370 . in this case , the dominant @xmath73 channel contribution to the three - body reaction @xmath371 , where the photon is generated by the isr , can be decomposed into two levels .",
    "first , a sneutrino is produced together with a photon in the two - body reaction @xmath372 and then the sneutrino decays as @xmath373 .",
    "thus , the muon energy in the center of mass of the sneutrino @xmath374 ( throughout this article a @xmath375 indicates that the variable is defined in the center of mass of the produced sneutrino ) is equal to , @xmath376 the transverse momentum limit of the produced muon in the center of mass of the sneutrino @xmath377 is given by @xmath378 since @xmath379 and @xmath380 .",
    "the important point is that the sneutrino rest frame is mainly boosted in the direction of the beam axis .",
    "this is due to the fact that the produced photon is mainly radiated at small angles with respect to the initial colliding particles direction ( see fig.[distribii ] ) .",
    "the consequence is that the transverse momentum of the produced muon is mainly the same in the sneutrino rest frame and in the laboratory frame . in conclusion ,",
    "the transverse momentum limit of the produced muon in the laboratory frame is given by @xmath381 , @xmath374 being calculated through eq.([enmu ] ) .",
    "we see explicitly through eq.([enmu ] ) that the value of @xmath382 increases with the sneutrino mass .",
    "+ in this first situation , where @xmath369 and @xmath370 , the isr effect is large so that the single chargino production cross section is enhanced .",
    "the distributions of fig.[isr ] are obtained for the point a ( for which @xmath383 ) with @xmath384 which corresponds to this situation of large isr .",
    "the distribution of fig.[isr ] gives a value for the transverse momentum kinematic limit of @xmath385 which is well approximately equal to @xmath386 where @xmath374 is calculated using eq.([enmu ] ) .",
    "+ based on this explanation , we can now understand why for large isr the transverse momentum of the produced muon @xmath359 is more peaked than its whole momentum @xmath387 : as we have discussed above , the muon transverse momentum @xmath359 is controlled by the two - body kinematics of the decay @xmath388 . for a set of susy parameters ,",
    "the muon transverse momentum is thus fixed if only the absolute value of the cosinus of the angle that makes the muon with the initial beam direction in the sneutrino rest frame is given .",
    "in contrast , the whole muon momentum @xmath387 is given by the three - body kinematics of the reaction @xmath357 and thus depends on the cosinus of the angle between the muon and the photon ( recall that the photon is mainly emitted along the beam axis ) in the laboratory frame .",
    "therefore , the muon transverse momentum @xmath359 is less dependent on the muon angle than the whole muon momentum @xmath387 , leading thus to a more peaked distribution .",
    "we consider now the scenario where @xmath389 or @xmath390 .",
    "in such a situation , the kinematics is different since the sneutrino can not be produced on shell .",
    "the single chargino production @xmath371 can thus not occur through the two - body reaction @xmath372 .",
    "in fact in this situation , the energy of the radiated photon becomes negligible so that the muon energy @xmath356 is given in a good approximation by the two - body kinematics formula of eq.([enl ] ) .",
    "the kinematic limit of the muon transverse momentum is related to this energy through @xmath391 .",
    "+ in this second scenario where @xmath389 or @xmath390 , the isr effect is negligible and the single chargino production rate is thus not increased . in fig.[noisr ] , we show the transverse momentum distribution ( without the cuts of section [ gsc ] ) of the produced muon in such a situation , namely at @xmath360 for the point a of the susy parameter space with @xmath195 and @xmath392 . for these susy parameters , the cross sections , polarized as in section [ polar ] , and the branching ratios are @xmath393 , @xmath394 and @xmath395 ( see section [ susyx ] for the values of @xmath366 ) .",
    "we check that the value of the muon transverse momentum kinematic limit @xmath396 obtained from the distribution of fig.[noisr ] is well approximately equal to @xmath397 where @xmath356 is obtained from eq.([enl ] ) .    at this stage",
    ", we can make a comment on the variation of the muon transverse momentum distribution associated to the single @xmath107 production with the value of the transverse momentum limiy @xmath368 .",
    "as can be seen by comparing fig.[isr ] and fig.[noisr ] , this distribution is more peaked for small values of @xmath368 due to an higher concentration of the distribution at low muon transverse momentum values .",
    "this effect is compensated by the fact that at low muon transverse momentum values the susy background is larger , as can be seen in fig.[isr ] .",
    "the determination of @xmath368 performed in this section allows us to verify that the muon produced with the chargino is well often the muon of highest transverse momentum .",
    "indeed , we have checked that in the two situations of large ( point a with @xmath398 ) and negligible ( point a with @xmath392 ) isr effect , the calculated values of @xmath368 for the produced muon were consistent with the values of @xmath368 obtained with the highest muon transverse momentum distributions ( fig.[isr ] and fig.[noisr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the identification of the produced muon with the muon of highest transverse momentum is correct for the two mssm points considered above .",
    "the well peaked shapes of the highest muon transverse momentum distributions for the point a with @xmath384 and @xmath392 are another confirmation of the validity of this identification .",
    "nevertheless , one must wonder what is the domain of validity of this identification .",
    "in particular , the transverse momentum of the produced muon can be small since @xmath368 which is determined via eq.([enl ] ) or eq.([enmu ] ) can reach low values . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath368 can reach small values in the scenario where @xmath399 and @xmath370 for @xmath400 close to @xmath401 ( see eq.([enmu ] ) ) , as well as in the scenario where @xmath402 or @xmath390 for @xmath89 close to @xmath401 ( see eq.([enl ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , the leptons generated in the cascade decay initiated by the @xmath7 become more energetic , and can thus have larger transverse momentum , for either larger @xmath403 masses or higher mass differences between the @xmath7 and @xmath403 .",
    "we have found that for produced muons of small transverse momentum corresponding to @xmath404 the identification remains valid for neutralino masses up to @xmath405 and mass differences up to @xmath406 .      in fig.[reach1 ] , we present exclusion plots at the @xmath407 level in the plane @xmath1 versus @xmath400 based on the study of the @xmath86 final state for several points of the susy parameter space and at a center of mass energy of @xmath2 assuming a luminosity of @xmath50 @xcite . the considered signal and backgrounds are respectively the single @xmath107 production and the pair productions of all the neutralinos and sneutrinos .",
    "the curves of fig.[reach1 ] correspond to a number of signal events larger than 10 .",
    "an efficiency of @xmath208 has been assumed for the reconstruction of the tau - lepton from its hadronic decay .",
    "the experimental lep limit on the sneutrino mass @xmath408 @xcite has been respected .",
    "we have included the isr effects as well as the effects of the polarization described in section [ polar ] , assuming an electron ( positron ) polarization efficiency of @xmath120 ( @xmath409 ) .",
    "the cuts described in section [ cuts ] have also been applied . in particular , we have applied some cuts on the transverse momentum of the produced muon . since the value of the muon transverse momentum depends on the sneutrino and chargino masses ( see section [ kin ] ) ,",
    "different cuts have been chosen which were appropriate to the different values of @xmath400 and @xmath410 considered in fig.[reach1 ] .",
    "we can observe in fig.[reach1 ] that the sensitivity on the @xmath1 typically increases as the sneutrino mass approaches the resonance point @xmath411 .",
    "this is due to the isr effect which increases the single chargino production rate as discussed in section [ signalx ] .",
    "while the isr effect is significant in the domain where @xmath399 and @xmath370 , it is small for @xmath402 or @xmath390 , the reason being that in the former case the single chargino production occurs through the production of an on shell sneutrino as explained in section [ kin ] .",
    "this results in a decrease of the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling at @xmath412 and @xmath413 as illustrate the various curves of fig.[reach1 ] .",
    "the decrease of the sensitivity corresponding to @xmath413 occurs at larger sneutrino masses for the point c compared to the other susy points , since for this set of susy parameters the chargino mass is larger : @xmath414 . + for @xmath415 the decay @xmath416 becomes dominant as explained in section [ signalx ] .",
    "this results in an increase of the sensitivity on @xmath1 which can be seen for the point c between @xmath417 and @xmath418 and for the points b and e between @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "+ additional comments must be made concerning the exclusion curve obtained for the point c : the decrease of sensitivity in the interval @xmath421 comes from the increase of the sneutrino pair production cross section ( see section [ susyx ] ) , while the increase of sensitivity in the range @xmath422 is due to an increase of the single chargino production rate which receives in this domain an important @xmath36 channel contribution . the significant sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling obtained for the point c in the interval",
    "@xmath423 emphasizes the importance of the off - resonance contribution in the single chargino production study at linear colliders . for @xmath424 ,",
    "the sensitivity obtained with the point c is weak with respect to the other susy points due to the high chargino mass which suppresses the signal cross section .",
    "+ we also see in fig.[reach1 ] that there are no important differences between the exclusion curves obtained for the susy points belonging to the higgsino region ( point a ) , the wino region ( point b ) and the intermediate domain ( point d ) .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the single chargino production has a cross section which decreases as going from the wino region to the higgsino region ( see section [ signalx ] ) .",
    "however , this is also true for the @xmath162 and most of the @xmath425 productions ( see section [ susyx ] ) .",
    "therefore , the sensitivities on the @xmath1 coupling obtained in the higgsino and wino region are of the same order .",
    "+ finally , we discuss the sensitivity obtained for the point e which is defined as the point b but with a smaller charged slepton mass .",
    "although the neutralino pair production rate is larger for the point e than for the point b ( see section [ susyx ] ) , the sensitivity obtained on @xmath1 is higher for the point e in all the considered range of sneutrino mass .",
    "this is due to the branching ratio @xmath426 which becomes important at the point e due to the hierarchy @xmath427 ( see section [ signalx ] ) .",
    "we mention that the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling tends to decrease as @xmath198 increases ( for @xmath199 ) and is weaker for @xmath428 ( with @xmath112 ) due to the evolution of the single chargino production rate which was described in section [ signalx ] .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of the sensitivity on @xmath1 found in fig.[reach1 ] remains correct for either large @xmath198 , as for instance @xmath429 , or negative @xmath57 .",
    "let us make some concluding remarks .",
    "we see in fig.[reach1 ] that the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling reaches values typically of order @xmath51 at the sneutrino resonance .",
    "we also observe that for each susy point the @xmath407 limit on the @xmath1 coupling remains more stringent than the low - energy limit at @xmath430 , namely @xmath431 @xcite , over an interval of the sneutrino mass of @xmath432 around the @xmath6 pole .",
    "therefore , the sensitivities on the susy parameters obtained via the single chargino production analysis at linear colliders would greatly improve the results derived from the lep analysis ( see section [ intro ] ) . besides , the range of @xmath1 values investigated at linear colliders through the single chargino production analysis ( see fig.[reach1 ] ) would be complementary to the sensitivities obtained via the displaced vertex analysis ( see eq.([lsp ] ) ) .",
    "first , the sneutrino mass can be determined through the study of the @xmath53 final state by performing a scan on the center of mass energy in order to find the value of @xmath89 at which hold the peak of the cross section associated to the sneutrino resonance .",
    "the accuracy on the measure of the sneutrino mass should be of order @xmath433 , where @xmath434 is the root mean square spread in center of mass energy given in terms of the beam resolution @xmath435 by @xcite , @xmath436 the values of the beam resolution at linear colliders are expected to verify @xmath437 .",
    "besides , the @xmath107 mass can be deduced from the transverse momentum distribution of the muon produced with the chargino .",
    "the reason is that , as we have explained in section [ kin ] , the value of the muon transverse momentum limit @xmath368 is a function of the @xmath107 and @xmath6 masses . in order to discuss the experimental determination of the chargino mass , we consider separately the scenarios of negligible and significant isr effect .    in the scenario where the isr effect is negligible ( @xmath402 or @xmath438 )",
    ", the value of the muon transverse momentum limit @xmath368 is equal to @xmath439 , @xmath356 being calculated in a good approximation with eq.([enl ] ) , as described in section [ kin ] . since eq.([enl ] ) gives @xmath356 as a function of the center of mass energy and the chargino mass , the experimental value of @xmath368 would allow to determine the @xmath7 mass .",
    "+ we now estimate the accuracy on the chargino mass measured through this method . in this method ,",
    "the first source of error comes from the fact that to calculate the value of @xmath356 in @xmath440 , we use the two - body kinematics formula of eq.([enl ] ) so that the small isr effect is neglected . in order to include this error , we rewrite the transverse momentum kinematic limit as @xmath441 ,",

    "the value of @xmath368 obtained from the transverse momentum distribution , we have found that @xmath442 .",
    "one must also take into account the experimental error on the measure of the muon transverse momentum expected at linear colliders which is given by : @xmath443 @xcite .",
    "hence , we take @xmath444 .",
    "the experimental error on the muon transverse momentum limit depends on the value of @xmath368 itself and thus on the susy parameters and on the center of mass energy .",
    "however , we have found that in the single chargino production analysis at @xmath445 , the experimental error on the muon transverse momentum limit never exceeds @xmath446 .",
    "another source of error in the measure of the @xmath7 mass is the root mean square spread in center of mass energy @xmath434 which is given by eq.([beam ] ) .",
    "+ for instance , at the point a with @xmath447 and an energy of @xmath2 , the muon transverse momentum distribution , which is shown in fig.[noisr ] , gives a value for the transverse momentum limit of @xmath396 .",
    "this value leads through eq.([enl ] ) to a chargino mass of @xmath448 taking into account the different sources of error and assuming a beam resolution of @xmath449 at linear colliders . here , the uncertainty on the chargino mass is important due to the large value of @xmath368 which increases the error @xmath450 .    in the scenario where the isr effect is important (",
    "@xmath399 and @xmath451 ) , the three - body kinematics of the reaction @xmath357 leaves the muon energy and thus the whole muon momentum @xmath452 unfixed by the susy parameters , since the muon energy depends also on the angle between the muon and the photon .",
    "hence , @xmath387 can not bring any information on the susy mass spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the experimental measure of the muon transverse momentum limit @xmath368 would give the @xmath7 mass as a function of the @xmath453 mass since @xmath454 ( see section [ kin ] ) and @xmath374 is a function of @xmath410 and @xmath455 ( see eq.([enmu ] ) . assuming that the @xmath453 mass has been deduced from the scan on the center of mass energy mentioned above , one could thus determine the @xmath7 mass .",
    "+ let us evaluate the degree of precision in the measure of @xmath456 through this calculation .",
    "first , we rewrite the transverse momentum limit as @xmath457 to take into account the error @xmath450 coming from the fact that the emission angle of the radiated photon with the beam axis is neglected ( see section [ kin ] ) . by comparing the value of @xmath374 calculated with eq.([enmu ] ) and the value of @xmath368 obtained from the transverse momentum distribution , we have found that @xmath442 . in order to consider the experimental error on @xmath368 , we take as before @xmath458 .",
    "one must also take into account the error on the sneutrino mass .",
    "we assume that this mass has been preliminary determined up to an accuracy of @xmath433 .",
    "+ for example , the transverse momentum distribution of fig.[isr ] , which has been obtained for the point a with @xmath361 and @xmath2 , gives a value for the transverse momentum limit of @xmath459 .",
    "the chargino mass derived from this value of @xmath368 via eq.([enmu ] ) is @xmath460 , if the various uncertainties are considered and assuming that @xmath461 which corresponds to @xmath449 and @xmath2 ( see eq.([beam ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath7 mass can be determined from the study of the peak in the muon transverse momentum distribution in the two scenarios of negligible and significant isr effect .",
    "the regions in the susy parameter space where a peak associated to the signal can be observed over the susy background at the @xmath407 level are shown in fig.[reach1 ] .",
    "these domains indicate for which susy parameters @xmath368 and thus the chargino mass can be determined , if we assume that as soon as a peak is observed in the muon transverse momentum distribution the upper kinematic limit of this peak @xmath368 can be measured .",
    "the single @xmath172 production @xmath462 is also of interest at linear colliders .",
    "this reaction , when kinematically open , has a smaller phase space factor than the single @xmath107 production .",
    "hence , the best sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling is obtained from the study of the single @xmath107 production . however , for sufficiently large values of the @xmath1 coupling , the @xmath462 reaction would allow to determine either the @xmath172 mass or a relation between the @xmath172 and @xmath6 masses .",
    "as described in section [ lightest ] , those informations could be derived from the upper kinematic limit @xmath368 of the peak associated to the single @xmath172 production observed in the muon transverse momentum distribution .",
    "indeed , the method presented in the study of the single @xmath107 production remains valid for the single @xmath172 production analysis .",
    "the simultaneous determination of the @xmath107 and @xmath172 masses is possible since the peaks in the muon transverse momentum distribution corresponding to the single @xmath107 and @xmath172 productions can be distinguished and identified . in order to discuss this point",
    ", we present in fig.[isr2 ] the muon transverse momentum distribution for the @xmath86 events generated by the reactions @xmath463 and @xmath462 and by the susy background at the mssm point a ( for which @xmath383 and @xmath464 ) with @xmath195 and @xmath254 .",
    "the cuts described in section [ gsc ] have not been applied . in this figure",
    ", we observe that the peak associated to the single @xmath172 production appears at smaller values of the transverse momentum than the peak caused by the single @xmath107 production .",
    "this is due to the hierarchy of the chargino masses .",
    "indeed , the chargino masses enter the formula of eq.([enmu ] ) which gives the values of @xmath465 for the point a with @xmath254 . the same difference between the two peaks",
    "is observed in the scenario where the values of @xmath466 are calculated using the formula of eq.([enl ] ) , namely for @xmath389 and @xmath467 , or @xmath390 .",
    "fig.[isr2 ] also illustrates the fact that the peaks associated to the single @xmath107 and @xmath172 productions can be easily identified thanks to their relative heights .",
    "the difference between the heights of the two peaks is due to the relative values of the cross sections and branching ratios which read for instance with the susy parameters of fig.[isr2 ] as ( including the beam polarization described in section [ polar ] ) : @xmath468 , @xmath469 , @xmath470 and @xmath471 .      in this section ,",
    "we comment on a similar study of the reaction @xmath0 based on the @xmath53 events at center of mass energies different from @xmath2 .",
    "first , the muon transverse momentum distributions depend mainly on the relative values of the center of mass energy and of the various susy masses , so that the discussion on the cuts given in section [ cuts ] still hold for different energies .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath54 and @xmath6 masses through the methods exposed in section [ marec ] is possible at any center of mass energy .",
    "we thus discuss in this section the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling that would be obtained at other center of mass energies than @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the values of the branching ratios are function of the susy mass spectrum , as shown in sections [ signalx ] and [ susyx ] , and thus do not change if the center of mass energy is modified .    besides , the amplitude of the isr effect on the signal cross section depends on the relative values of @xmath348 , @xmath401 and @xmath89 ( see section [ kin ] ) .",
    "the shapes of the exclusion curves obtained at different center of mass energies would thus be similar to the shapes of the exclusion plots presented in fig.[reach1 ] for same relative values of @xmath348 , @xmath401 and @xmath89 .    however , the cross sections of the susy backgrounds , namely the @xmath333 and @xmath314 productions , depend strongly on the center of mass energy which determines the phase space factors of the superpartners pair productions .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling tends to decrease ( increase ) at higher ( smaller ) center of mass energies due to the increase ( decrease ) of the susy background rates .      in this section",
    ", we would like to emphasize the interest of the @xmath55 final state for the study of the reaction @xmath0 at linear colliders .",
    "first , the @xmath55 final state is generated by the decay @xmath472 which has a larger branching ratio than the decay @xmath473 for the hierarchy @xmath209 , as mentioned in section [ signalx ] .",
    "+ secondly , the background of the @xmath55 signature is the @xmath474 production .",
    "the rate of the @xmath55 production from the @xmath475 reaction is @xmath476 ( @xmath477 ) at @xmath2 ( @xmath133 ) including the cuts @xmath125 , @xmath126 and neglecting the isr @xcite .",
    "this background can be further reduced as explained in section [ smback ] . besides",
    ", the @xmath55 signature has no @xmath478-conserving susy background if one assumes that the lsp is the @xmath10 and that the single dominant coupling is @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the pair productions of susy particles typically lead to final states wich contain at least 4 charged leptons due to the decay of the two lsp s through @xmath1 as @xmath29 .",
    "+ therefore , the sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling obtained from the study of the single chargino production based on the @xmath55 final state should be greatly enhanced with respect to the analysis of the @xmath53 signature .",
    "the @xmath55 final state is also attractive from the mass reconstruction point of view .",
    "indeed , the full decay chain @xmath479 , @xmath29 can be reconstructed .",
    "the reason is that , since the muon produced together with the chargino in the reaction @xmath463 can be identified ( see section [ kin ] ) the origin of each particle in the final state can be known .",
    "first , the @xmath10 mass can be measured with the distribution of the invariant mass of the two charged leptons coming from the @xmath480 decay : the value of the @xmath10 mass is readen at the upper endpoint of this distribution .",
    "similarly , the upper endpoint of the invariant mass distribution of the two jets coming from the chargino decay gives the mass difference @xmath481 .",
    "since @xmath482 has already been determined from the dilepton invariant mass , we can deduce from this mass diffference the @xmath107 mass .",
    "+ besides , the @xmath6 and @xmath54 masses can be measured as explained in section [ marec ] . + hence",
    ", in the case of a non - vanishing @xmath25 coupling with @xmath480 as the lsp , the combinatorial background for the @xmath10 mass reconstruction from the study of the single chargino production based on the @xmath55 final state is expected to be greatly reduced with respect to the analysis based on the pair production of susy particles @xcite , due to the better identification of the charged leptons coming from the @xmath10 decay .",
    "furthermore , while the @xmath54 and @xmath6 masses reconstructions are possible via the single chargino production , these reconstructions appear to be more difficult with the pair production of susy particles .",
    "indeed , the @xmath95 and @xmath6 masses reconstructions from the superpartner pair production are based on the @xmath10 reconstruction , and moreover in the pair prodution the @xmath95 or @xmath6 decays lead to either an additional uncontroled missing energy or an higher number of charged particles ( or both ) in the final state with respect to the single chargino production signature .",
    "the single chargino production at muon colliders @xmath483 ( see fig.[graphe ] ) would allow to study the @xmath484 coupling , @xmath485 being equal to either @xmath144 or @xmath34 due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath75 couplings .",
    "the study of the @xmath486 coupling would be essentially identical to the study of @xmath1 .",
    "only small modifications would enter the analysis : since an electron / positron would be produced together with the chargino , one should require that the final state contains at least one electron instead of one muon as in the @xmath1 case ( section [ gsc ] ) .",
    "besides , one should study the distribution of the highest electron transverse momentum instead of the highest muon transverse momentum .",
    "the particularities of the muon colliders would cause other differences in the study : first , the analysis would suffer an additional background due to the @xmath57 decays in the detector . secondly",
    ", large polarization would imply sacrifice in luminosity since at muon colliders this is achieved by keeping only the larger @xmath487 muons emerging from the target @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects an interesting sensitivity on the @xmath486 coupling from the single @xmath107 production at muon colliders although this sensitivity should not be as high as in the study of the @xmath1 coupling at linear colliders .",
    "+ besides , the @xmath488 reaction occuring through @xmath486 would allow to determine the @xmath10 , @xmath107 , @xmath172 and @xmath6 masses as described in sections [ marec ] and [ hadron ] for the single chargino production at linear colliders .",
    "the main difference would be the following .",
    "the accuracy in the determination of the sneutrino mass performed through a scan over the center of mass energy would be higher at muon colliders than at linear colliders .",
    "the reason is the high beam resolution @xmath435 expected at muon colliders ( see section [ lightest ] ) . for instance , at muon colliders the beam resolution should reach @xmath489 for a luminosity of @xmath490 and an energy of @xmath491 @xcite .",
    "the production of a single chargino together with a tau - lepton occurs through the @xmath99 coupling at linear colliders and via @xmath492 at muon coliders . due to the @xmath17-decay",
    ", the transverse momentum distribution of the produced @xmath17-lepton can not be obtained with a good accuracy .",
    "the strong cut on the transverse momentum described in section [ kin ] is thus difficult to apply in that case , and one must think of other discrimination variables such as the total transverse momentum of the event , the total missing energy , the rapidity , the polar angle , the isolation angle , the acoplanarity , the acollinearity or the event sphericity . therefore , the sensitivities on the @xmath99 and @xmath492 couplings obtained from the @xmath493 production should be weaker than the sensitivities expected for @xmath1 and @xmath486 respectively .",
    "furthermore , the lack of precision in the @xmath17 transverse momentum distribution renders the reconstructions of the @xmath10 , @xmath107 and @xmath172 masses from the @xmath493 production ( see sections [ marec ] and [ hadron ] ) difficult .",
    "we have seen in sections [ kin ] and [ reach ] that when the sneutrino mass is smaller than the lightest chargino mass ( case of small isr effect ) , the single chargino production cross section is greatly reduced at linear colliders .",
    "the reason is that in this situation the radiative return to the sneutrino resonance allowed by the isr is not possible anymore .",
    "the interesting point is that for @xmath494 , the radiative return to the sneutrino resonance remains possible in the single @xmath10 production through @xmath32 : @xmath495 .",
    "therefore , in the region @xmath494 the single @xmath10 production has a larger rate than the single @xmath107 production and is thus attractive to test the @xmath32 couplings .",
    "+ we give now some qualitative comments on the backgrounds of the single neutralino production .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath10 is the lsp , the @xmath496 production leads to the @xmath497 final state due to the decay @xmath29 .",
    "this signature is free of @xmath478-conserving susy background since the pair production of susy particles produces at least 4 charged leptons due to the presence of the lsp at the end of each of the 2 cascade decays .",
    "the background is strong as it comes from the @xmath498 and @xmath118 productions but it can be reduced by some kinematic cuts .",
    "+ therefore , in the region @xmath499 , one expects an interesting sensitivity on @xmath32 from the single neutralino production study which was for instance considered in @xcite for muon colliders .",
    "the single @xmath10 production allows also to reconstruct the @xmath10 mass .",
    "indeed , the neutralino mass is given by the endpoint of the distribution of the 2 leptons invariant mass in the @xmath497 final state generated by the single @xmath10 production .",
    "the combinatorial background is extremely weak since the considered final state contains only 2 charged leptons .",
    "if the sneutrino is the lsp , when it is produced at the resonance through @xmath32 as @xmath500 , it can only decay as @xmath501 assuming a single dominant coupling constant .",
    "hence , in this scenario , the sneutrino resonance must be studied trhough its effect on the bhabha scattering @xcite .",
    "this conclusion also holds in the case of nearly degenerate @xmath6 and @xmath10 masses since then the decay @xmath502 is dominant compared to the decay @xmath503 .",
    "the study at linear colliders of the single chargino production via the single dominant @xmath1 coupling @xmath0 is promising , due to the high luminosities and energies expected at these colliders . assuming that the @xmath10 is the lsp , the singly produced chargino has 2 main decay channels : @xmath504 and @xmath79 .",
    "the leptonic decay of the produced chargino @xmath504 ( through , virtual or real , sleptons and @xmath28-boson ) leads to the clean @xmath53 final state which is almost free of background .",
    "this signature suffers a large susy background in some regions of the mssm parameter space but this susy background can be controled using the initial beam polarization and some cuts based on the specific kinematics of the single chargino production .",
    "therefore , considering a luminosity of @xmath3 at @xmath2 and assuming the largest susy background , values of the @xmath1 coupling smaller than the present low - energy bound could be probed over a range of the sneutrino mass of @xmath505 around the sneutrino resonance and at the @xmath6 pole the sensitivity on @xmath1 could reach values of order @xmath51 .",
    "besides , the @xmath53 channel could allow to reconstruct the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 masses .",
    "the hadronic decay of the produced chargino @xmath79 ( through , virtual or real , squarks and @xmath28-boson ) gives rise to the @xmath173 final state .",
    "this signature , free from susy background , has a small background and should thus also give a good sensitivity on the @xmath1 coupling constant .",
    "this hadronic channel should allow to reconstruct the @xmath403 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 masses .",
    "the sensitivity on the @xmath99 coupling constant , obtained from the @xmath493 production study , is expected to be weaker than the sensitivity found on @xmath1 due to the decays of the tau - lepton .",

    "<S> we study the single chargino production @xmath0 at linear colliders which occurs through the @xmath1 r - parity violating coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the final state containing 4 leptons and some missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> the largest background is and can be reduced using the initial beam polarization and some cuts based on the specific kinematics of the single chargino production . assuming the highest allowed supersymmetric background , a center of mass energy of @xmath2 and a luminosity of @xmath3 , the sensitivities on the @xmath1 coupling constant obtained from the single chargino production study improve the low - energy experimental limit over a range of @xmath4 around the sneutrino resonance , and reach values of @xmath5 at the @xmath6 pole . </S>",
