    "the problem of describing non - leptonic decays is a very old one and is still not fully solved today . in this talk",
    "i will describe the large @xmath4 method first suggested in a series of papers by bardeen , buras and grard@xcite and later extended by several other authors .",
    "i will illustrate most of the problems and solutions on the example of the charged and neutral pion mass difference and afterwards show how this method can be extended systematically to the case of non - leptonic weak decays as well .",
    "the main results described there are those of @xcite and also descibed in @xcite .",
    "the subject of this meeting was hadronic physics , so why are we interested in these extra quantities .",
    "they provide a very strong test of our understanding of the strong interaction at all length scales .",
    "our present knowledge of the strong interaction can be summarized as :    short distance : : :    this is the perturbative qcd domain and here qcd has had many    successes , we count this region as understood .",
    "( very ) long distance : : :    this is the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) regime@xcite .",
    "many    successes again and basically understood .",
    "intermediate distance : : :    this is the domain of models supplemented with various arguments , sum    rules , lattice qcd results , etc . and is the most difficult .    in the type of observables covered in this talk",
    "all three regimes are important .",
    "we consider processes with incoming and outgoing hadrons but with an internally exchanged photon or weak boson .",
    "the difficulty now resides in the fact that even if the external hadrons have all low momenta we need to integrate over all momenta of the internal @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "this means that all regimes come into play and that they need to be connected properly to each other .",
    "the last is known as matching .",
    "the main part is in sect .",
    "[ pippi0 ] where i show how we can explain the mass difference , @xmath7 using this class of methods . here",
    "we can also see how the model approach and the correct answer agree .",
    "[ kaon ] then covers the extra problems involved in non - leptonic weak decays and how the @xmath8-boson method of @xcite can be used to solve those .",
    "finally i present numerical results for this case and conclusions .",
    "this non - leptonic matrix element has several features that make it simpler .    1",
    ".   we can neglect @xmath9 and @xmath10 to a rather good approximation .",
    "this then allows current algebra to relate the electromagnetic mass difference to a vacuum to vacuum matrix element only@xcite .",
    "this can then be related to the measured hadronic cross - sections in electron - positron annihilation so in this case we know the correct answer .",
    "2 .   there are no large masses involved so there are no large logarithms that need resummation .",
    "3 .   the photon itself provides for an easy identification of correct scales .",
    "basically the procedure is now to evaluate @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the meson under consideration and @xmath13 for the electromagnetic current .",
    "@xmath14 is a gauge parameter .",
    "the procedure is now as follows : + * 1:*we rotate the integral over photon momenta in eq .",
    "( [ massdiff ] ) to euclidean space .",
    "this has two advantages , in euclidean space thresholds and poles are smoothed out making treatment of these easier and euclidean space momenta have all components small if @xmath15 is small .",
    "the latter allows for a simpler identification of long and short - distance than in minkowski space . + * 2 : * the final step is now to set @xmath16 and perform both integrals separately .",
    "notice that the scale @xmath17 is just a splitting scale in the integral and is not directly related to any subtraction scale in the calculation itself .",
    "therefore , if both the long - distance ( from 0 to @xmath17 ) and the short - distance are calculated with high enough precision the final result should be independent of the value of @xmath17 .",
    "we check this by varying @xmath17 in all our calculations , i.e. we check the matching .      the short - distance contribution was first calculated in @xcite using the sum rule by das et al.@xcite .",
    "it was later rederived using the operator product expansion in @xcite .",
    "the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figdashen ] depict the main contributions .    performing the photon integral leads to a set of four - quark operators that can be evaluated in leading @xmath18 since we",
    "can then apply factorization .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 the pion decay constant in the chiral limit and @xmath21 the parameter in lowest order chpt describing the quark condensate .      in the previous subsection",
    "we could use perturbative qcd but that is not possible in the long distance domain .",
    "so here we have to put in the things we know and try various models .",
    "chpt : : :    this can be done for @xmath17 rather small and leads to    @xmath22    the first term was first done in @xcite and the chiral correction in    @xcite .",
    "the two contributing diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figdashen2 ] .",
    "+    +    something that is important is that the gauge dependence only cancels    between the two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figdashen2 ] .",
    "chiral quark model : : :    this was done in @xcite and gives only a marginal improvement .",
    "note    that we can not use the usual dimensional regularization here but must    use the cut - off in the photon propagator .",
    "there is the additional    problem that at first sight only the equivalent of the diagram of    fig  [ figdashen2](a ) appears , which is a two - loop diagram , and the    result is not gauge invariant .",
    "only after the equivalent of ( b ) is    added , which is a three - loop diagram , does the gauge dependence cancel    as required@xcite . with vector - axial - vector mesons",
    ": : :    we have to include here weinberg s constraint on the couplings to    obtain a unique result otherwise the result will be very dependent on    the specific model used .",
    "e.g. a hidden gauge model with only vector    mesons is still quadratic in @xmath23 but with a negative    coefficient . using weinberg s constraints leads to    @xmath24.\\ ] ] but    beware of partial results . using a linear vector representation",
    "only    even gave a quartic dependence on @xmath17@xcite .",
    "the result    in ( [ vmd ] ) for @xmath25 is basically the result of    @xcite and was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "it has also several nice    features .",
    "expanding in @xmath17 for small @xmath17    reproduces the chpt result with the meson dominated value for    @xmath26 . for large @xmath17",
    "it goes as    @xmath27 so it can match on very well to the earlier    short - distance result .",
    "enjl : :    this basically coincides with the previous result and was first    obtained in @xcite .",
    "extensions of the above exists for nonzero - quark masses@xcite and references therein and also with more large @xmath4 arguments to underpin the matching@xcite .",
    "numerical results are shown in fig  [ figdashen3 ] for all cases .",
    "the experimental value and the one with the sub - leading in @xmath18 subtracted are shown as the horizontal lines .",
    "the subtracted part is the chiral logarithm contribution as estimated in @xcite .",
    "notice that chpt starts deviating quickly from the vmd and enjl results .",
    "the chpt result is only reliable up to about 500 mev .",
    "the vmd result and the enjl result basically coincide here , the difference is due to the precise input values .",
    "both these curves also follow essentially the correct answer as obtained from electron - positron annihilation and the sum - rule of @xcite .",
    "notice that the enjl model has the correct matching on to the low @xmath17 chpt result and is a considerable improvement over it at higher @xmath17 .",
    "notice also the almost perfect agreement with the estimated part leading @xmath4 part of the mass - difference .    from this section",
    "we can conclude :    1 .",
    "different low energy models give quite different results and we have to use short - distance constraints and phenomenological inputs to improve the long - distance contribution to above the regime where chpt is applicable .",
    "2 .   chpt alone for the long - distance regime is as a first guestimate acceptable but start differing from the correct answer at a scale of about 500  mev .",
    "3 .   even for this low - momentum dominated observable the short - distance contributions are sizable at scales around 800  mev .",
    "one of the difficult unresolved problems is to understand the origin of the @xmath2 rule .",
    "the underlying process is @xmath6-exchange leading to an operator of the quark - structure @xmath28 which has both isospin @xmath29 and isospin @xmath30 pieces .",
    "if we assume the @xmath6 couples directly to hadrons the process @xmath31 goes simply via the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figkdecay ] , but there are no such diagrams for @xmath32 because of charge conservation .",
    "so we would expect that @xmath33 .",
    "the experimental numbers are @xmath34 and @xmath35 precisely the opposite . translated into isospin amplitudes for the decays ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite for the precise definitions , we obtain @xmath36the problem is not due to chiral corrections since using the estimate of @xcite we can extract them and get @xmath37 where the last number is the one using naive @xmath6-exchange as depicted in fig .   [ figkdecay ] . in the notation used in @xcite we have @xmath38 which after subtracting the estimated chiral corrections from experiment yields @xmath39 both @xmath40 and @xmath41 are equal to one in the @xmath6-exchange limit",
    ", the constant @xmath42 was chosen to have this .",
    "we thus have to explain the large deviation from 1 using the corrections suppressed by @xmath18 .",
    "this is not a hopeless task as the sub - leading corrections coming from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figdashen ] with the photon replaced by the gluon are of order @xmath43 compared to the leading contribution and this is in fact larger than one .",
    "luckily we know how to resum this type of logarithms@xcite . at a high scale we can replace the effect of @xmath6-exchange by a sum of local operators by virtue of the operator product expansion .",
    "we can then use the whole renormalization group machinery to run this sum over local four - quark operators down to a low scale @xmath44 .",
    "this is explained in great detail in @xcite .",
    "the end result is @xmath45 with a series of known coefficients @xmath46 , the wilson coefficients .",
    "the final answer is then the matrix element of this sum over four - quark operators , @xmath47 .",
    "but here we have two problems :    1 .   in the previous section",
    "the short and long - distance contributions were separated via the photon momentum .",
    "here we have to link this somehow to the scale @xmath44 appearing in the weak hamiltonian @xmath48 .",
    "next - to - leading order in the renormalization group the coefficients @xmath46 also depend rather strongly on the precise definition of the local four quark operators @xmath49 in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "in @xcite we showed how the method of @xcite supplemented with the correct momentum routing @xcite solved problem 1 . in @xcite and in",
    "the various already published talks @xcite we showed how a careful identification across the long - short - distance boundary is also possible in this case .",
    "the basic idea is to go at the scale @xmath44 back from the local four - quark operators to the exchange of a series of @xmath8-bosons .",
    "these @xmath8-bosons can then be treated in exactly the same way as we did the photon in the previous section , thus allowing a correct calculation at all length scales .",
    "so we replace , using a single operator as an example @xmath50\\,.\\ ] ] using the tree level diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figx ] this gives @xmath51 .",
    "if we now include the one loop diagrams we obtain instead : @xmath52 on the l.h.s .",
    "the scheme dependence disappears but there is a dependence in @xmath53 on the choice of external states .",
    "the exact same dependence in @xmath54 cancels this .",
    "we now split the integral over the @xmath8-boson momentum as in the previous section @xmath55 in the final answer all @xmath56 dependence drops out , the logarithm proportional to @xmath57 shows up in precisely the same way in the evaluation of the short distance part of ( [ split ] ) which is proportional to @xmath58 the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath59 give the corrections to the naive @xmath18-method .",
    "we now use the @xmath8-boson method described above and put @xmath60 .",
    "the low energy part can be calculated using chpt , this is the approach used originally by @xcite and presently pursued by @xcite without including the corrections due to the change in scheme when going to the long - distance part .",
    "their results coincide with ourss when we restrict our results to their approximations .",
    "@xmath62 is the bag - parameter relevant for @xmath63 mixing at the physical quark masses and @xmath64 the same in the chiral limit .",
    "the quark mass corrections are quite sizable .",
    "the results for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained without any free input and agree within the uncertainties of the method with the experimental values .",
    "we conclude that we basically now have a first principle understanding of the @xmath2 rule .",
    "we discuss the various contributions below .",
    "@xmath65 is the coefficient of the weak mass term , it contributes at leading order to processes like @xmath66@xcite and is often forgotten in those analyses .",
    "finally @xmath3 is much larger than used in all the analysises of the recent experimental results for @xmath67@xcite which is very encouraging .",
    "the final result for @xmath40 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figg8 ] .",
    "we have shown the one - loop result ( 1-loop ) , the two - loop result with ndr wilson coefficients ( 2-loop ) and the two - loop results with correction for the long - distance scheme added ( si ) using our results for the long distance part .",
    "we also showed what naive factorization with the si wilson coefficients would give and what the method of @xcite would give in the chiral limit with the same wilson coefficients ( si  quad ) .",
    "if we look at the various contributions to @xmath40 we see in fig .",
    "[ figg8_comp ] that the contribution of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are both large and fairly constant while @xmath70 contributes 20% or less .",
    "if we look inside the calculation we see that the difference with the @xmath41 evolution is mainly given by the long - distance penguin - like contributions to @xmath69 .",
    "ccddddd @xmath17 ( gev ) & & 0.6 & 0.7 & 0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 + chpt & & 1.19 & 0.93 & 0.70 & 0.50 & 0.36 + enjl & & 2.27 & 2.16 & 2.11 & 2.11 & 2.14 +    the behaviour of @xmath3 is more difficult , it is ill - defined in the chiral limit in the factorizable approximation@xcite and we can thus only define it with respect to the full large @xmath4 limit . calculating it in chpt only then gives fairly low values as is visible in the second line of table [ tab : b6 ] .",
    "adding higher order corrections we immediately obtain a strongly enhanced value as is obvious from the second line in table [ tab : b6 ] .",
