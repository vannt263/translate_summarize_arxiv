    ", it is known that the conjecture is true @xcite , but not much is known for more than two tiles .",
    "already the case with three tiles is computationally involved .",
    "we concentrate here on the cases with substitution matrices of small trace .",
    "more precisely , all inequivalent substitution matrices @xmath4 with @xmath5 have been generated , and for all substitutions with these matrices ( 446683 substitutions in total ) , we have checked that the spectrum is pure discrete .",
    "the other type of tilings we consider are the self - affine tilings constructed from the endomorphisms of free groups by kenyon @xcite .",
    "we have looked at the cubic polynomials whose coefficients are all less than or equal to @xmath6 , except for a single case , whose computation is beyond our computer capability .",
    "all other examples turn out to be pure discrete .",
    "we also give some non pure discrete examples of self - affine tilings in  [ non ] .",

    "our aim is to show that there are only finitely many matrices @xmath54 .",
    "indeed this implies that all entries of @xmath16 are bounded by @xmath55 , since otherwise there is an entry of @xmath56 larger than this bound . from @xmath57",

    "although lemma [ bound ] gives a bound for the number of substitutions whose perron - frobenius root is less than @xmath45 , it is too large to be useful in practice . in the sequel , we deduce a practical estimate by the property of the pisot number to narrow the range of computation . if @xmath11 is a pisot substitution of degree @xmath71 whose incidence matrix has a pisot number @xmath41 as the perron - frobenius root , we have @xmath72 .",

    "@xmath104 we easily have @xmath105 from ( [ pisot ] ) . by using the bound of @xmath81 ,",
    "there are @xmath106 substitutions matrices with the characteristic polynomial @xmath107 .",
    "however , these matrices form a single orbit under the group @xmath108 which permutes the symbols , so that only one matrix with 2 substitutions needs to be checked . moreover",
    ", there is a further symmetry which can be taken into account in order to avoid duplicate work .",
    "let @xmath109 be the ` mirror ' map , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "for a given substitution @xmath11 , we define @xmath111 by @xmath112 for @xmath13",

    "the list of matrices satisfying these bounds is finite , but still contains some pairs which are equivalent under a permutation of the symbols .",
    "only one matrix of each such pair is retained .",
    "for any substitution matrix @xmath4 in the list , there are only finitely many substitutions @xmath11 with @xmath120 ( of which we keep only one per mirror pair ) , so that we obtain a finite list of irreducible pisot substitutions to be checked .",
    "then we use the ` potential overlap algorithm ' of @xcite and a new implementation @xcite of the classical overlap algorithm @xcite to check all the substitutions in the list .",
    "moreover , since the substitutions in the list are irreducible ( prop .",
    "1.2.8 of @xcite ) , we may check by the balanced pair algorithm @xcite as well . up to symbol relabelling and mirror symmetry as above , there are 7377 irreducible cubic pisot unit substitutions , as given in table 1 , and all of them are pure discrete .",
    "the number of non - unit substitutions , especially with trace @xmath118 , is much larger , and on average each computation is much harder .",
    "these non - unit cases could mostly be checked only with a new implementation @xcite of the classical overlap algorithm in the gap language @xcite , in which a special effort has been made to keep the memory requirements small .",
    "also the non - unit substitutions turned out to be pure discrete .",
    "the results are summarized in table  1 .",

    "experiments with an implementation of the balanced pair algorithm in gap @xcite , similar to that of the classical overlap algorithm @xcite , suggests that the latter has an advantage for more complex substitutions .",
    "this is likely due to the balanced pairs not only growing in number , but also in length , which requires more memory to store them , but especially also more work to compare them .",

    "generalizing the idea of dekking @xcite , kenyon @xcite introduced a class of self - similar tilings generated by the endomorphisms of a free group over three letters @xmath158 : @xmath159 where @xmath160 are integers for which @xmath161 has exactly two roots @xmath162 with modulus greater than one .",

    "the endomorphism @xmath168 acts naturally on the boundary word @xmath169 which represent three fundamental parallelograms , and gives a substitution rule on the parallelograms .",
    "the associated tile equations are @xmath170 where @xmath138 is either @xmath171 or @xmath165 depending on whether @xmath165 is real or complex , respectively .",
    "it is known @xcite that if the expansion map @xmath138 of a self - affine tiling in @xmath125 is diagonalizable and the tiling has pure discrete dynamical spectrum , then @xmath138 should fulfill the pisot family property .",
    "so we are interested in considering self - affine tilings with the pisot family property on the expansion map @xmath138 . for this construction",
    ", we require that two roots of the polynomial @xmath161 are greater than one , and one root is smaller than one in modulus . in this case , we can note that there are no roots on the unit circle .",
    "we adapt the schur - cohn criterion ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap.10 , th.43 , 1 ) ) , which says that the number of roots within the unit circle coincides with the number of sign changes of the following sequence : @xmath172 where @xmath173 if all entries are non - zero .",
    "notice that it can not be that @xmath174 , otherwise all the roots of the polynomial have the same modulus .",
    "thus from @xmath175 and @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "so the signs come from @xmath178 the last term is not zero , since @xmath179 can not be a root of @xmath180 .",
    "when @xmath181 , the second term vanishes and the third term is negative ( because @xmath182 or @xmath92 is positive ) .",
    "since the roots of the polynomial are continuous with respect to the coefficients , the small perturbation of @xmath93 does not change the number of roots inside / outside of the unit circle .",
    "therefore we may assume that the second coefficients are non - zero and use the schur - cohn criterion ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the number of zeroes within the unit circle is @xmath183 when @xmath184 and it is @xmath0 when @xmath185 . if @xmath186 , then the second term is positive . in this case , applying the small perturbation argument when the third term vanishes , the number of zeroes within the unit circle is @xmath183 when @xmath184 and @xmath187 or @xmath0 when @xmath185 .",
    "overall we obtain a unified conclusion that the number of zeroes within the unit circle is @xmath183 if and only if @xmath184 .",
    "our tiling exists when @xmath188 .    for @xmath189",
    ", there are 34 cases : @xmath190 @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 we determined the spectral type of the tiling dynamical systems except for the case @xmath194 .",
    "all computed systems admit an overlap coincidence , and thus have a pure discrete spectrum . in the remaning case @xmath194 , the tiles are very thin , so that the number of initial overlaps seems to be beyond the capability of our program .",
    "in this section , we wish to give two intriguing examples of self - affine tilings whose dynamical spectrum is not pure discrete .",
    "both tiling dynamics are not weakly mixing and therefore there exist non - trivial eigenvalues of their translation actions .",
    "bandt discovered a non - periodic tiling in @xcite , whose setting comes from crystallographic tiles , and called it the _ fractal chair tiling_. the tile satisfies the following set equation @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the 6-th root of unity .",
    "it is called @xmath6-rep - tile , because it is a non - overlapping union of three similar contracted copies , i.e. , the associated iterated function system satisfies the open set condition @xcite .    ]",
    "applying the substitution rule , we obtain a tiling of the plane by six tiles @xmath197 and their translates as given in figure [ bandt ] .",
    "this tiling is _ non - periodic _ , i.e. , the only translation which sends the tiling exactly to itself is the zero vector .",
    "we can confirm that this tiling is repetitive and the corresponding expansion map satisfies the pisot family property .",
    "so we can apply the potential overlap algorithm from @xcite .",
    "our program shows that the fractal chair tiling is not purely discrete .",
    "the overlap graph with multiplicity contains a strongly connected component of spectral radius @xmath6 , being equal to the spectral radius of the substitution matrix , which does not lead to a coincidence .",
    "in fact , the existence of such a component is shown in @xcite to be equivalent to having non - pure discrete spectrum .",
    "geometrically this means that there is a finite set @xmath198 of overlaps not containing any coincidence , which is mapped to itself under the substitution .",
    "we call such a set @xmath198 a _ non - coincident component_. we visualize in figure [ overlap ] how each overlap in the non - coincident component does not lead to a coincidence .",
    "each figure represents an overlap of two fractal chair tiles , and the support of the overlap is depicted in thick color .",
    "the destinations of outgoing arrows show that we obtain three overlaps from each overlap by substitution .    ]    as another example , the following substitution @xmath199 with the characteristic polynomial @xmath200 arose in the study of self - inducing 4 interval exchanges by p.  arnoux , s.  ito and m.  furukado @xcite .",
    "as it is a pisot substitution , the natural suspension tiling satisfies the pisot family condition and our potential overlap algorithm readily applies .",
    "it is of interest to check this non - weakly mixing system , as it is shown by @xcite that a generic interval exchange transformation which is not a rotation is weakly mixing .",
    "our algorithm shows that its suspension tiling dynamics is not pure discrete .",
    "although there are several known reducible pisot substitutions which are not pure discrete , this example is noteworthy in the sense that the non - coincident component is much more intricate than in other known examples . we describe it by another substitution on the 12 letters : @xmath201 the associated tile equation of this substitution gives the non - coincident component of the suspension tiling corresponding to ( [ 4iet ] ) . in other words , ( [ ov2 ] ) is the exact analogue of figure [ overlap ] , once we associate the intervals of canonical lengths given by the left eigenvector of the substitution matrix . since the original tiling is a factor of this new suspension tiling , the system is again not pure discrete .",
    "the above two substitution examples have reducible characteristic polynomials .",
    "so the assumption of the pisot substitution conjecture in higher dimensions of @xcite does not hold .",
