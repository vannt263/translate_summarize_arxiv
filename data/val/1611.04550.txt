    "all physics knowledge is built on the study of models .",
    "formulating a model for the system of interest is thus a key step in any project . of course , `` all models are wrong , but some of them are useful '' @xcite .",
    "this is because ideally , a model incorporates all relevant physics of the studied system so that its solution is useful to gain intuition and knowledge regarding some properties of interest . at the same time , models discard details assumed to be irrelevant for these properties . even though this makes them `` wrong '' , it is a necessary and even desirable step if the solution is to not be impossibly complicated .    how to decide where lies the separation line between relevant and irrelevant aspects for a given system and set of properties of interest , is still an art .",
    "a general guiding principle , based on perturbation theory , is that high - energy states can be discarded ( integrated out ) if one is interested in low - energy properties .",
    "consequently , it is assumed that models with identical low - energy spectra provide equivalent descriptions of a system , and therefore the simplest of these models can be safely used .",
    "a prominent example is the modeling of cuprates .",
    "it is widely believed that the emery model @xcite can be replaced by the simpler @xmath1-@xmath2 model to study their low - energy physics @xcite .",
    "the justification was provided by zhang and rice @xcite who argued that the low - energy states of the emery model are singlets formed between the spin of a doping hole hosted on the four oxygens surrounding a copper and the spin of that copper , and that the resulting quasiparticle is described accurately by the @xmath1-@xmath2 model @xcite . whether this is true",
    "is still being debated @xcite .    in this article",
    "we show that by itself , the condition that two models have the same low - energy spectrum is not sufficient to guarantee that they describe similar low - energy properties , despite widespread belief to the contrary .",
    "indeed , we identify three models that have identical @xmath0 quasiparticles yet have very different behavior at _ any _ temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the qualitative differences are due to rare events controlled by thermal fluctuations , which lead to a pseudogap - type of phenomenology .    while our argument takes the form of a `` proof by counterexample '' , we also provide arguments that our findings are not merely an `` accident '' caused by our specific choice of models , but are more general in nature .",
    "specifically , we comment on its validity in arbitrary dimensions and also for other types of magnetic coupling which differ from the examples that are our main focus .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : we introduce the models in section [ sec : models ] , and discuss our method of solution in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "the main results , which are for a particle injected into a ferromagnetic ( fm ) background , are presented in section [ sec : fm_results ] , while section [ sec : afm_results ] contains some results for an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) background , which further substantiate our claims .",
    "short conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "because we are interested in the quasiparticle spectrum , from now on we consider only the single carrier sector of the fock space . to be specific , we take the carrier to be an electron added into an otherwise empty band ; the solution is mapped onto that for removing an electron from a full band by changing the energy @xmath4 .",
    "the models of interest are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "they describe the interaction of the carrier with a background of local moments , and as such bear some similarity to those used in the zhang - rice mapping mentioned above .",
    "model i is the parent two - band model , from which models ii and iii are derived as increasingly simpler effective models . in model",
    "i , one band hosts the spin@xmath5 magnetic moments and a second band , located on a different sublattice , hosts the carrier .",
    "model ii is also a two - band model , but the carrier and local moments are located on the same sites .",
    "one can think of the states occupied by the carrier in this model as being local linear combinations of the carrier states in model i , each centered at a spin site . in model iii ,",
    "the carrier is locked into a singlet with its lattice spin , forming a `` spinless carrier '' analogous to the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "there are also significant differences between our models and the zhang - rice mapping : ( i ) we restrict ourselves to one dimension as this suffices to prove our claim .",
    "however , some comments on the extension of our results to higher dimensions can be found below ; ( ii ) we concentrate on the case of a ferromagnetic ( fm ) background because for models with an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) background the @xmath0 spectra are not identical .",
    "however , we also present some afm results later on , to demonstrate that some of the features we discuss here are generic , not fm - specific ; and ( iii ) all spin exchanges are ising - like , _ i.e. _ no spin flipping is allowed .",
    "the latter constraint allows us to find numerically the exact solutions using a metropolis algorithm @xcite , to uncover a surprising finite-@xmath6 behavior for model iii .",
    "in all three cases , the interactions between the local moments are described by the ising hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 for model i and @xmath9 for models ii and iii , and @xmath10 is the ising operator for the local magnetic moment located at @xmath11 ( we set @xmath12 ) .",
    "its eigenvalues are @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    "the ground state of @xmath15 is fm , and it is afm for @xmath16 . in the case of fm coupling , the external magnetic field @xmath17 can be used to favor energetically one of the two possible fm ground states of the @xmath18 case .    for models i and ii",
    ", the kinetic energy of the carrier is described by a nearest - neighbor hopping hamiltonian : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the creation operator for a spin-@xmath21 carrier at site @xmath22 and @xmath23 are states with momentum @xmath24 and eigenenergy @xmath25 ( the lattice constant is set to @xmath12 ) .",
    "the interaction between the carrier and the local moments is an afm ising exchange : @xmath26 note that flipping the sign of the carrier spin corresponds to letting @xmath27 , so we can assume without loss of generality that the carrier has spin - up and suppress the spin index .",
    "the total hamiltonian for models i and ii is thus given by @xmath28 .",
    "model iii is the fm ( @xmath14 ) or afm ( @xmath16 ) ising version of the one - band @xmath1-@xmath2 model discussed extensively in the cuprate literature @xcite .",
    "the case of interest now has @xmath29 electrons in the @xmath30 site system ( @xmath31 ) , and double occupancy is forbidden apart from the site where the additional carrier is located and which can be viewed as hosting a `` spinless carrier '' whose motion shuffles the otherwise frozen spins .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath32 , where the operator @xmath33  projects out additional double occupancy .",
    "it is important to note that in contrast to models i and ii , here the spin - operators @xmath34 are related to the electron creation / annihilation operators via @xmath35 .",
    "we calculate the finite-@xmath6 spectral weight @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the one - carrier propagator .",
    "if the carrier is injected in the magnetic background equilibrated at temperature @xmath6 , its real - time propagator is @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the density matrix of the undoped chain in thermal equilibrium , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the operators in the heisenberg representation ( we set @xmath42 ) .    in frequency domain , the propagator becomes : @xmath43 the sum is over all configurations @xmath44 of the ising chain , with corresponding energies @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the resolvent is @xmath47^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath48 ensures retardation .",
    "the shift by @xmath49 in the argument of the resolvent shows that the poles of the propagator mark the _ change _ in the system s energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the eigenenergies of the system with the carrier present , and those of the undoped states into which it was injected .",
    "this reflects the well - known fact that electron addition states have poles at energies @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "after fourier transforming to real space and using the invariance to translations of the thermally averaged system , we arrive at : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fourier transform of the amplitude of probability that a state with configuration @xmath53  and the carrier injected at site @xmath54  evolves into a state with the carrier injected at site @xmath55 .",
    "these real - space propagators are straightforward to calculate , as they correspond to a single particle ( consistent with our assumption of a canonical ensemble with exactly one extra charge carrier in the system ) moving in a frozen spin background .",
    "we emphasize that this is true only because of the ising nature of the exchange between the background spins .",
    "heisenberg coupling , on the other hand , would lead to spin fluctuations that would significantly complicate matters .",
    "below we present the calculation of these real - space propagators for model iii . for model",
    "ii , the solution is described in detail in ref . , and the same approach , with only minor modifications , applies to model i.    it is convenient to introduce the following notation .",
    "when an extra electron is injected at site @xmath54 of model iii it effectively removes the spin at this site .",
    "the spin @xmath56 will therefore be missing from the set @xmath53 which describes the state of the spin - chain before injection .",
    "consequently we label the new state , after injection , as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the effective `` hole '' created by the injection of the extra electron .",
    "the `` hole '' can propagate along the chain and in doing so reshuffles the spins . to capture the propagation of the `` hole '' we introduce a new index @xmath59 corresponding to the number of sites that the `` hole '' has hopped to the left ( @xmath60 ) or right ( @xmath61 ) . a general state is therefore given by @xmath62 . note that this way of labelling states is not unique .",
    "for instance , if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .    with this notation ,",
    "the real - space propagators are @xmath65 .",
    "their equations of motion ( eom ) are obtained by splitting the hamiltonian in two parts , @xmath66 , and repeatedly using dyson s identity @xmath67 .",
    "choosing @xmath68 and suppressing the @xmath69 and @xmath53-dependence we obtain @xmath70 , \\\\",
    "f_{0,n } & = -t g_0(\\omega + \\delta_n)[f_{0,n+1 } + f_{0,n-1 } ] ,   \\label{eq : eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 .",
    "the exact form of @xmath75  depends on the sign of @xmath54 : @xmath76    the eom ( [ eq : eom ] ) can be solved with the ansatz @xmath77 , for @xmath78  and @xmath79  for @xmath80 . since the `` hole '' has a finite lifetime @xmath81  and @xmath82  measures the probability that the `` hole '' injected at site 0 moves to site @xmath54 , one expects @xmath83  for @xmath84 .",
    "we therefore introduce a sufficiently large cutoff @xmath85  and require @xmath86 .",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain @xmath87    to calculate the @xmath88  we make use of the fact that hopping reshuffles the spins .",
    "therefore @xmath89 , only if @xmath90 .",
    "in that case , as mentioned above , the states @xmath91  and @xmath92  are equal which means that @xmath93 .    the thermal average in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf - ft ] ) is then calculated for the infinite chain with a metropolis algorithm which generates configurations @xmath53 of the undoped chain . to summarize , our method of solution consists of the following steps : _",
    "( i ) _ generate a configuration @xmath94 of the ising chain using a metropolis algorithm ; _ ( ii ) _ calculate all the @xmath95 propagators for that specific configuration , and perform the sum over @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf - ft ] ) ; _ ( iii ) _ repeat steps _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ until convergence is reached .",
    "full details of this procedure can be found in ref . for model ii ; the generalization to models i and iii is straightforward . for model iii",
    "it is convenient to inject the carrier with an unpolarized total spin , to ensure that a `` hole '' is always created . since for each configuration",
    "@xmath94 there is a configuration @xmath96 with all the spins flipped , injecting an unpolarized carrier does not change the results , but merely speeds up the numerics .",
    "at @xmath0 , the undoped ising chain is in its fm ground state .",
    "the quasiparticles of models i and ii have energy @xmath97 if the carrier is injected with its spin antiparallel / parallel to the background . only the former case can be meaningfully compared with model iii , which has a quasiparticle of energy @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is the cost of removing two fm ising bonds ) .",
    "thus , apart from trivial shifts , the three models have identical quasiparticles , namely carriers free to move in the otherwise fm background .",
    "finite-@xmath6 spectral weights @xmath100 for the different models are shown in fig .",
    "we emphasize that only the electron - addition part is discussed here .",
    "we do not consider the electron - removal states , which lie at energies well below those of the electron - addition states and must be identical for all three models because in all cases , one of the electrons giving rise to the magnetic moments is removed .",
    "we also emphasize that our calculation is in a canonical ensemble .",
    "the chemical potential is not fixed at @xmath101 , as customary in grand canonical formulations , instead it can be calculated as @xmath102 $ ] as @xmath103 . as pointed out above , here @xmath104 marks the energy of the undoped ising chain .    for models i and ii , shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , at the lowest temperature one can see two peaks marking the contributions from injection of the carrier into the two ground states of the ising chain ( all spins up and all spins down , respectively ) .",
    "indeed , these peaks are located at @xmath105 , the lower one of which is marked by the vertical line .",
    "note that we chose a large @xmath106 value to keep different features well separated and thus easier to identify .",

    "these resonances are due to temporal trapping of the carrier inside small magnetic domains that are thermally generated at higher @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of these domains also explains the decreasing difference between the @xmath18 and @xmath107 curves at higher @xmath6 . for @xmath113",
    "both curves are shown in the main panels ( the finite @xmath17 curve is shaded in ) . indeed , the resonances appear in the same places and with equal weight in both curves , the only difference being a small spectral weight transfer from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , _",
    "i.e. _ from the fm ground - state disfavored by @xmath116 to the one favored by it .",
    "the weight for the former is no longer zero like for @xmath103 , showing that at higher-@xmath6 the carrier is increasingly more likely to explore longer domains of spin - up local moments .",
    "the main difference between models i and ii is that the latter also has a third finite-@xmath6 continuum , centered around @xmath104 .",
    "it corresponds to injecting the carrier in small afm domains , where its exchange energy vanishes because it sits between a spin - up and a spin - down local moment .",
    "such energy differences are not possible in model ii , where the carrier interacts with a single moment so its exchange energy is @xmath117 .    however , if one is interested in the low - energy behavior , models i and ii are equivalent because their low - energy continua have similar origins and evolve similarly with @xmath6",
    "this is true in the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) , as can be seen from comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the finite-@xmath6 evolution of the spectral weight of model iii is very different .",
    "consider first the @xmath118 case , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "the @xmath0 peak at @xmath119 ( marked by the vertical line ) evolves with @xmath6 very similarly to the low - energy peaks of the other two models , broadening on its high - energy side and again displaying resonances due to temporal trapping inside small domains",
    ". the @xmath120 evolution of this feature , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , is also very similar to the low - energy continua of the other two models .",
    "however , for model iii this continuum is _ not _ the low - energy feature . instead , in 1d there are three lower - energy continua centered at @xmath121 and @xmath122 , all of which are due to injection of the carrier into specific , thermally excited configurations of the background .",
    "for example , consider the @xmath123 continuum which also appears in dimensions @xmath124 .",
    "as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it corresponds to the carrier being paired with a thermally excited spin .",
    "this lowers the exchange energy by @xmath125 , as @xmath126 afm bonds are broken .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 doping always leads to loss of exchange energy , because only fm bonds can be broken .",
    "this is why in model iii it can cost less energy to dope from a thermally excited state rather than the ground - state , and therefore why its finite-@xmath6 low - energy properties are not controlled by the @xmath0 quasiparticle .     and lies ( at least partially ) below the @xmath0 quasiparticle ground - state energy of @xmath127 . ]",
    "the weight of these low - energy continua is very small , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , because they are controlled by thermal activation .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath128 the spectral weight of the continuum centered at @xmath123 can be calculated to first order , as was shown in refs , by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf - ft ] ) in powers of @xmath129 .",
    "the lowest order terms correspond to the two fm ground states which have all spins aligned , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the first order terms are given by states with a single flipped spin and are denoted by @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where @xmath134 indicates the location of the flipped spin . since the flipped spin can be anywhere in the system there are @xmath30 of these states for each ground state configuration .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the spin of the extra carrier is unpolarized , then it suffices to consider only @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the contribution from the other ground state will be exactly the same . considering only these states in the trace of eq .",

    "the extra carrier removes the flipped spin .",
    "this results in the breaking of @xmath126 afm bonds and therefore an energy gain of @xmath125 .",
    "furthermore as pointed out above only @xmath142 contributes to the sum since the extra carrier was injected into a domain of length 1 .",
    "since the flipped spin was removed and all the remaining spins are aligned it is easy o calculate @xmath142 which in the limit @xmath31 becomes @xmath143 _ i.e. _ a continuum of states centered at @xmath144 .",
    "we are now left with calculating the remaining contributions to @xmath140 for which @xmath145 .",
    "this is not a trivial problem , but since there is only one flipped spin in the system and we are summing over all `` hole '' locations , we can approximate @xmath146 . in doing",

    "ii , interaction with the afm background opens a gap in the quasiparticle spectrum and halves its bz . the upper and lower bands have dispersion @xmath175 , respectively . for model iii , the @xmath0 spectral function is independent of @xmath120 and has a coherent quasiparticle peak at @xmath176 and a continuum for @xmath177 .",
    "the quasiparticle peak corresponds to a bound state with the extra electron confined at its injection site .",
    "propagation of the extra electron along the chain reshuffles the ising spins and gives rise to the continuum centered at @xmath178 .",
    "one can therefore think of this continuum as the electron+magnon continuum .",
    "mathematically , the @xmath120-independence follows directly from the fact that for model iii , @xmath179 when @xmath78 , if @xmath180 is the afm ground state .    the finite-@xmath6 spectral functions for @xmath118 are shown in fig .",
    "for all three models the peaks broaden and spectral weight appears below , as well as above the @xmath0 quasiparticle peak .",

    "i the energy difference between the low - energy states and the @xmath0 peak is controlled by @xmath106 , whereas for model ii it is of the order of @xmath1 . just as for the fm case , these features can be linked to small domains which temporarily trap the carrier @xcite . as the temperature increases more weight",
    "is transferred to these low - energy features , and the low - energy behavior of model ii starts to resemble that of model i even though they have different @xmath0 quasiparticles .    for model iii , at finite-@xmath6 new features",
    "appear , centered at @xmath181 and @xmath55 . just as for the fm case , they are due to the injection of the extra electron into specific , excited , local configurations of the chain . if the electron is injected into a small fm domain embedded in an otherwise afm ordered background , the energy is lowered by @xmath182 .",
    "as long as the electron stays within the fm domain reshuffling of the spins does not result in a further change in energy .",
    "this explains the appearance of spectral weight at @xmath183 .",
    "this is true for any dimension @xmath184 and consequently the appearance of spectral weight at @xmath185 is a generic feature of model iii . coming back to the specific case of @xmath186 ,",
    "if the electron leaves the fm domain reshuffling of the spins recreates an fm bond and destroys one of the afm bonds .",
    "the total change in energy ( injection and reshuffling ) is therefore zero , explaining the continuum centered around @xmath187 . besides the appearance of these new , low - energy continua , resonances appear close to the @xmath0 quasiparticle peak and within the high - energy continuum ( not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] due to the scale ) .",
    "they are likely caused by injection of the electron into an afm domain and subsequent scattering off domain walls which can only exist at finite-@xmath6 .",
    "in this work , we identified models that have identical @xmath0 low - energy quasiparticles ( for couplings favoring a fm background ) , and yet exhibit very different low - energy behavior at finite @xmath6 , proving that the former condition does not automatically guarantee the latter .",
    "in particular , the finite-@xmath6 behavior in model iii is controlled by rare events , where the carrier is injected into certain magnetic configurations created by thermal fluctuations .",
    "their energies are higher than that of the undoped ground - state , however the spectral weight measures the _ change _ in energy upon carrier addition ( or removal ) , and this may be lower at finite-@xmath6 than at @xmath0 .",
    "this is the case for model iii because here doping removes a magnetic moment from the background while its motion reshuffles the other ones .",
    "it is not the case for models i and ii where the carrier can do neither of these things .",
    "this difference is irrelevant at @xmath0 because of the simple nature of the undoped fm ground - state , but becomes relevant at finite-@xmath6 .",
    "we showed that such transfer of finite-@xmath6 spectral weight well below the @xmath0 quasiparticle peak is independent of the size of the magnetic coupling @xmath2 and occurs for both fm and afm coupling .",
    "furthermore , we provided arguments that this behavior is expected to occur in any dimension .    while far from being a comprehensive study , these results clearly demonstrate that the appearance of finite-@xmath6 spectral weight well below the quasiparticle peak , due to the injection of the carrier into a thermally excited local environment making it behave very unlike the @xmath0 quasiparticle , is a rather generic feature for @xmath1-@xmath2 like models .",
    "the weight of these finite-@xmath6 , low - energy features must vanish when @xmath103 because the probability for such excited environments to occur vanishes , therefore these models exhibit generic pseudogap behavior .",
