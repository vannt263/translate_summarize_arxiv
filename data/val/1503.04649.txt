    "the phenomenal argument by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) in 1935 @xcite to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics , struck schrdinger with the concept of ` steering ' @xcite .",
    "however , only recently , wiseman _ et al . _ have formalized the concept of steering in the form of a task @xcite .",
    "the task of steering can be seen as one s inability to construct a _ local hidden variable- local hidden state _",
    "( lhv - lhs ) model that reproduces a given bipartite correlation . the work of wiseman _",
    "_ has generated an immense interest in the study of this steering phenomenon @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the concept of steering has been extended for multipartite case and the idea of n - partite genuine mutipartite steering have been explored @xcite . unlike the two well studied non classical correlations , namely _",
    "nonlocality _ @xcite and _ entanglement _",
    "@xcite , there is an inherent asymmetry in the task of steering .",
    "this is because in case of steering , on one subsystem ( which is being ` steered ' ) the statistics must arise out of a valid measurement on a valid quantum state but no such constraint is required for the other subsystem . here in addition to the simplicity of bell s assumptions of _ local causality _",
    "one must also perform trusted measurements on one subsystem , whereas the other subsystem need not be trusted @xcite .",
    "apart form the foundational interest , the study of steering also finds applications in semi device independent scenario where only one party has trust on his / her quantum device but the other party s device is untrusted . as a concrete example",
    "it has been shown that steering allows for secure quantum key distribution ( qkd ) when one of the parties can not trust their devices @xcite .",
    "one big advantage in this direction is that such scenarios are experimentally less demanding than fully device - independent protocols ( where both of the parties distrust their devices ) @xcite and , at the same time , require less assumptions than standard quantum cryptographic scenarios @xcite .    in 1964",
    ", bell sought a way to demonstrate that certain correlations appearing in quantum mechanics are incompatible with the notions of _ locality _ and _ reality _ aka _ local - realism _ ( lr ) , through an inequality involving measurement statistics @xcite .",
    "a violation of such inequality implies the usefulness of correlations for epr argument . in 1969 , clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) proposed a set of simple bell inequalities which are easy to realize experimentally @xcite . in the same spirit of bell s inequality in non - locality , several steering inequalities ( si )",
    "have been proposed @xcite , so that a violation of any such steering inequalities can render a correlation to be steerable .",
    "but an unavoidable hindrance to formalize such sis follows from the fact that steering scenario is device - independent only on one - side .",
    "recently cavalcanti _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed a chsh - like inequality for quantum steering @xcite .",
    "they have derived an epr - steering inequality that is necessary and sufficient for a set of correlations in the simplest two - party scenario involving two measurement settings per site and two outcomes per measurement , with mutually unbiased measurements at trusted party . in this article we derived the tight optimal quantum violation of the epr - steering inequality proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the violation amount of this inequality for different well - known classes of @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "interestingly , we find that for different @xmath0-qubit pure entangled states the optimal violation amount of this inequality differ .",
    "note that , for all other existing sis such difference is not observed .",
    "the organization of this article goes as follows : we first briefly review few existing steering inequalities along with the newly proposed chsh like steering inequality . then we show that the optimal violation of this chsh like steering inequality in quantum theory is restricted to @xmath1",
    ". then we study how the optimal violation amount of the chsh like inequality varies for different entangled states .",
    "to test epr steering reid first proposed a testable formulation for continuous - variable systems based on position - momentum uncertainty relation @xcite which was experimentally tested by ou et al @xcite .",
    "developed a general construction of experimental epr - steering criteria based on the assumption of existence of lhs model @xcite .",
    "importantly this general construction is applicable to both the discrete as well as the continuous - variable observables and reid s criterion appears as a special case this general formulation . on the other hand , walborn _ et al .",
    "_ formulated a steering inequality based on bialynicki - birula and mycielski s entropic position - momentum uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "as the entropic uncertainty relation implies heisenberg s uncertainty relation , hence the set of states violating walborn _",
    "s steering inequality contains all the states violating reid s inequality .",
    "thus walborn _ et al . _",
    "s steering criterion is more powerful than reid s one .",
    "however this is true for continuous variable case only , not for the discrete case . in all instances",
    "the violation of the aforementioned inequalities by different pure entangled states are the same .",
    "all of these steering inequalities have been proved to be as sufficient conditions for witnessing steering in bipartite quantum systems . but none of these condition is supposed to be a necessary and sufficient condition for steering .",
    "search for such an necessary and sufficient condition has been culminated in a recent development by cavalcanti _",
    "they have proposed an chsh like epr - steering inequality that is necessary and sufficient for the set of correlations in the simplest scenario involving two settings and two outcomes per setting , with mutually unbiased measurements at trusted end . at this point",
    "it is interesting to ask the following questions :    * what is the optimal violation of this newly proposed chsh like steering inequality in quantum theory ? * how the violation amount of the concerned inequality depends on the state ?",
    "we provide a definite answer for the first question and study the second one for some classes of states .",
    "let us first briefly review the steering scenario as introduced by wiseman _",
    "given a pair of systems at alice and bob , denote @xmath2 and @xmath3 the sets of observables in the hilbert space of alice s and bob s system , respectively .",
    "an element of @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath4 , with a set of outcomes labeled by @xmath5 , and similarly for bob .",
    "the joint state @xmath6 of the system is steerable by alice iff it is not the case that for all @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the joint probability distributions can be written in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes an arbitrary probability distribution and @xmath12 denotes the quantum probability of outcome @xmath13 given measurement @xmath14 on state @xmath15 . in other words",
    "the state @xmath6 will be called steerable if it does not satisfy a lhv - lhs model .",
    "note that , if for a given measurement strategy the correlations have a lhv  lhs model , this does not imply that the underlying state is not steerable , since there could be another strategy that does not . in the simplest scenario where alice and bob each have a choice between two dichotomic measurements to perform : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and outcomes of @xmath4 are labeled @xmath18 and similarly for the other measurements , the authors of ref.@xcite derived a necessary and sufficient criterion for steering which reads as : @xmath19 we know that , in the simplest bell scenario which involves two observers with @xmath0 dichotomic measurements per site , the set of local correlations lies in a polytope ( lhv polytope ) with chsh inequality providing the non trivial facets of the lhv polytope . in the steering scenario with similar settings the set of correlations having lhv - lhs description also form a polytope .",
    "one of the authors of this article , along with other collaborators , have shown that measurement incompatibility limits the bell - chsh inequality violation in quantum theory to cirelson bound @xcite . adopting similar approach and using a recently established connection between measurement incompatibility and steering , we derive the optimal quantum violation of the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) . before establishing this result",
    "we first briefly review the concept of measurement incompatibility and the concept of unsharp measurement in quantum theory .    _",
    "measurement incompatibility : _ in the case of projective measurements , compatibility is uniquely captured by the notion of commutativity .",
    "non commutative projective measurements in quantum mechanics do not admit unambiguous joint measurement @xcite . with the introduction of the generalized measurement i.e. positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) @xcite , it was shown that observables which do not admit perfect joint measurement , may allow joint measurement if the measurements are made sufficiently fuzzy @xcite .",
    "therefore , for general measurements there is no unique notion of compatibility . in this article measurement incompatibility",
    "is captured by non joint measurability @xcite .",
    "mathematically , a povm consists of a collection of operators @xmath20 which are positive , @xmath21 , and sum up to the identity , @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 denotes measurement outcome and @xmath24 denotes measurement choices .",
    "physically , any povm can be realized by first letting the physical system interact with an auxiliary system and then measuring an ordinary observable on the auxiliary system . a set of @xmath25 povms @xmath20 is called jointly measurable if there exists a measurement @xmath26 with outcome @xmath27 $ ] where @xmath28 gives the outcome of @xmath29 measurement , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for the elements of @xmath32 except for @xmath33 .",
    "hence , all povm elements @xmath34 are recovered as marginals of the mother observable @xmath35 .    _ unsharp measurement : _ let us consider two dichotomic quantum measurements @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are not jointly measurable . denoting eigenvalues of these operator as @xmath38",
    ", the expectation value over some state @xmath39 can be expressed as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the povm elements corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "the unsharp of fuzzy observable is given by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 here @xmath45 $ ] is known as  unsharpness parameter \" and the fraction @xmath46 is called  degree of reality \" @xcite .",
    "it may happen that the observables @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not allow any joint measurement , but with introduction of sufficient amount of unsharpness , there unsharp versions @xmath47 and @xmath48 may allow joint measurement . in ref.@xcite , the authors have proved that given any d - dimensional quantum system , joint measurement for unsharp versions of any two dichotomous observables @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the system is possible with the largest allowed value of the unsharpness parameter @xmath51 .",
    "note that the expectation value of an unsharp observable @xmath52 over some quantum state @xmath39 is related to the expectation value of its sharp version in the following manner , @xmath53 similarly , if alice performs unsharp measurement @xmath52 on her part and bob performs sharp measurement @xmath54 on his part of a bipartite shared state @xmath6 than we have , @xmath55    except from quantum entanglement , another necessary ingredient which is necessary for study of quantum nonlocality is the existence of incompatible set of measurements . in the simplest bipartite scenario wolf _",
    "_ showed that any set of two incompatible povms with binary outcomes can always lead to violation of the chsh - bell inequality @xcite .",
    "but , recently in refs.@xcite the authors have proved that this result does not hold in the general scenario where numbers of povms and outcomes are arbitrary .",
    "however in this general settings the authors of @xcite have established a connection between measurement incompatibility and a weaker form of quantum nonlocality i.e. , epr - schrdinger steering .",
    "they have shown that for any set of incompatible povms ( i.e. not jointly measurable ) , one can find an entangled state , such that the resulting statistics violates a steering inequality .",
    "please note that , one of the authors of this article has recently proved that connection between measurement incomparability and steering holds for a more general class of tensor product theories rather than just hilbert space quantum theory @xcite .",
    "let alice performs a measurement assemblage @xmath56 on her part of a bipartite shared quantum state @xmath6 .",
    "upon performing measurement @xmath24 , and obtaining outcome @xmath23 , the ( un - normalized ) state held by bob is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the normalized state on bob side is given by @xmath58 .",
    "also we have @xmath59 , which actually ensure no signaling from alics to bob .",
    "the state assemblage @xmath60 is un - steerable iff it admits a decomposition of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "existence of such decomposition for state assemblage on bob s side ensures that the statistics obtained from the state @xmath6 admits a combined lhv - lhs model of the form of eq.([steer ] ) .",
    "the authors in refs.@xcite have shown that the assemblage @xmath60 , with @xmath57 , is un - steerable for any state @xmath6 acting on @xmath63 if and only if the set of povms @xmath56 acting on @xmath64 is jointly measurable . as a corollary of this result we can say that    _ corollary 1 _ : the assemblage @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , is unsteerable for any state @xmath6 acting in @xmath68 if and only if the set of povms @xmath69 acting on @xmath64 is jointly measurable .    at this stage , we are now in a position to prove our main result , which is described in the following theorem .    _ theorem 2 _ : consider a composite quantum system composed of two subsystem with state spaces @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . for any pair of dichotomic observables @xmath36 , @xmath37 for the first system and the mutually unbiased dichotomic observables @xmath72 , @xmath73 for the second system and the joint state @xmath6 acting on @xmath74",
    ", we have the following inequality : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the optimal unsharpness parameter that allows joint measurement for any two dichotomic quantum observables .    _ proof",
    "_ : let us consider two arbitrary dichotomic observables @xmath56 on alice side , @xmath77 and @xmath18 .",
    "these two observables in general may not allow joint measurement .",
    "however , introduction of unsharpness makes it possible to measure the unsharp version of these two observables jointly .",
    "let the optimal unsharpness is @xmath76 which allows joint measurement for any two dichotomic observables .    now according to corollary @xmath78 , as far as observables on alice s side are jointly measurable",
    ", they will not violate any steering inequality and hence the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) .",
    "thus we have    @xmath79    now using the expressing from eq.([eta ] ) we get ,    @xmath80    the value of @xmath76 in quantum theory is proved to be @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "therefore the upper bound of the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) in quantum theory is @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath82 , which is numerically equal to the celebrated cirelson value .",
    "naturally the question arises whether this value is tight or not . in the following section we answer this question affirmatively by showing that sharing a maximally two qubit entangled state with suitable choice of measurement",
    ", this value can be achieved in quantum theory .",
    "in this section we study the optimal violation of the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) for different given entangled states .    _ observation 1 _ : @xmath83 is different for different @xmath0-qubit pure entangled states .",
    "consider that an arbitrary 2-qubit pure entangled state @xmath84 is shared between alice and bob .",
    "alice performs measurements @xmath85 and @xmath86 on her part of the entangled particle where @xmath87 .",
    "similarly bob performs measurements @xmath88 and @xmath89 on his part of the entangled particle where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath92 are mutually unbiased qubit measurements .",
    "varying over the measurement directions of alice and bob we have numerically found the optimal violation amount of the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) for a given @xmath0-qubit pure entangled state and in fig.[fig1 ] we have plotted it with respect to state parameter @xmath23 .    ) for different @xmath0-qubit pure entangled states.,width=264,height=170 ]    from fig.[fig1 ] it is clear that all @xmath0-qubit pure entangled states violate the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) . it is important to note that the optimal violation amount is different for different states with maximally entangled state providing the maximum violation @xmath1 where alice performs measurement in the directions @xmath93 and @xmath94 and bob s mub measurements look like @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "please note that except from the steering inequality considered here , for all other existing steering inequalities the violation amount does not change with respect to different pure entangled states .",
    "_ observation 2 _ : @xmath83 for @xmath0-qubit werner class of states .",
    "consider that alice and bob share the werner state @xmath97 ; where @xmath98 is the singlet state . likewise in the previous case ,",
    "varying over the measurement setup of alice and bob we find the optimal violation amount of the steering inequality ( [ eq_nec_suf ] ) for different werner state and plot this values in fig.[fig2 ] .    ) for @xmath0-qubit werner class of states . ]    from fig.[fig2 ] it is clear that werner states violate the steering inequality for @xmath99 and the violation amount increase with the parameter @xmath100 .",
    "there have been several attempts to quantify quantum steering .",
    "two most recent instances are ` steerable weight ' @xcite , ` steering robustness ' @xcite and ` relative entropy of steering ' @xcite .",
    "but all of these proposed quantifiers assign same value for all pure entangled states @xcite . at this point",
    "our observation becomes interesting .",
    "since the amount of violation can also be shown to be non increasing under steering non - increasing operations ( snios ) @xcite , one can take this amount of violation to be a valid quantifier of quantum steering .",
    "our study stipulates further studies whether some semi device independent protocol(s ) can be deigned whose payoff scales with violation amount of the steering inequality considered here . in such case different violation amount of the steering inequality by different pure entangles states will have an operational explanation .",
    "we also find the violation of the chsh like steering inequality by @xmath0-qubit werner states .",
    "the inequality is violated by werner states if @xmath99 and beyond this value it follows a trait- the more entangled the state , more is the violation . we also find that the violation of this steering inequality in qm is tightly upper bounded by @xmath1 , the well known cirelson quantity .    * acknowledgment * : it is a pleasure to thank prof .",
