    "a distinguishing feature of the chiral and trace anomalies in gauge theory is that their coefficients can be determined to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "my aims in this article are to survey the historical route leading to the discovery of this property of anomalies , and to review its current status . in the first part",
    "i discuss the nonrenormalization of the chiral anomaly , in its historical context and then from a modern perspective . in the second part",
    "i discuss the closely analogous results linking the coefficient of the trace anomaly to the renormalization group @xmath0 function . in the third part ,",
    "i conclude by discussing the interplay of these two results in the context of supersymmetric theories .",
    "my 1969 paper on anomalies [ ] consisted of two parts .",
    "the first was a discussion of the axial anomaly in spinor electrodynamics , and represented work done during the spring and summer of 1968 and written up in longhand form ( awaiting typing on my return to princeton ) while i was at the aspen center of physics .",
    "the second part consisted of an appendix and additional footnotes , written after sidney coleman arrived in aspen towards the end of my stay there , and told me about the independent work done by bell and jackiw [ ] on the anomaly in the context of the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) calculation of @xmath1 decay in the sigma model .",
    "both parts are relevant to the story of the anomaly nonrenormalization theorem , and so i shall begin by discussing them in some detail .",
    "i got into the subject of anomalies in an indirect way , through exploration during 19671968 of the speculative idea that the muon  electron mass difference could be accounted for by giving the muon an additional magnetic monopole electromagnetic coupling through an axial - vector current , which somehow was nonperturbatively renormalized to zero .",
    "after much fruitless study of the integral equations for the axial - vector vertex part , i decided in the spring of 1968 to first try to answer a well - defined question , which was whether the axial - vector vertex in qed was renormalized by multiplication by @xmath2 , as i had been implicitly assuming . at the time when i turned to this question ,",
    "i had just started a 6-week visit to the cavendish laboratory in cambridge , england after flying to london with my family on april 21 , 1968 . in the cavendish i shared an office with my former adviser sam treiman , and",
    "was enjoying the opportunity to try a new project not requiring extensive computer analysis ; i had only a month before finished my annals of physics paper [ ] on weak pion production , which had required extensive computation , not easy to do in those days when one had to wait hours or even a day for the results of a computer run .",
    "my interest in the multiplicative renormalization question had been piqued by work of van nieuwenhuizen , in which he had attempted to demonstrate the finiteness to all orders of radiative corrections to @xmath3-decay , using an argument based on subtraction of renormalization constants that i knew to be incorrect beyond leading order .",
    "i had learned about this work during the previous summer , when i was a lecturer at the varenna summer school held by lake como from july 17 - 29 , 1967 , at which van nieuwenhuizen had given a seminar on this topic that was critiqued by bjorken , another lecturer . , and",
    "several archival historical accounts , i had written `` my interest in the multiplicative renormalization question had been piqued by a preprint i received from peter van nieuwenhuizen , in which he attempted to show that the axial vector vertex is made finite by the usual renormalizations , using an argument based on subtractive renormalization that i saw was incorrect . '' on reexamining my files in the course of preparing this article , i found that my copy of van nieuwenhuizen s undated preprint entitled `` finiteness of radiative corrections in all orders to @xmath3-decay '' had been sent , in response to a letter i wrote to veltman , by veltman s secretary ms .",
    "rietveld , who wrote a cover letter dated may 28 , 1968 expressing the hope that the preprint would reach me while i was still in england .",
    "thus i could not have seen the preprint until the end of my stay in cambridge .",
    "i do not have a copy of my letter to veltman inquiring about a preprint version of van nieuwenhuizen s talk , to which ms .",
    "rietveld s letter was a response . ] working in the old cavendish , i rather rapidly found an inductive multiplicative renormalizability proof , paralleling the one in bjorken and drell [ ] for finiteness of @xmath2 times the vector vertex .",
    "i prepared a detailed outline for a paper describing the proof , but before writing things up , i decided as a check to test whether the formal argument for the closed loop part of the ward identity worked in the case of the smallest loop diagram .",
    "this is a triangle diagram with one axial and two vector vertices ( the @xmath4 triangle ; see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , which because of furry s theorem ( @xmath5 invariance ) has no analog in the vector vertex case .",
    "i knew from a student seminar that i had attended during my graduate study at princeton that this diagram had been explicitly calculated using a gauge - invariant regularization by rosenberg [ ] , who was interested in the astrophysical process @xmath6 , with @xmath7 a virtual photon emitted by a nucleus .",
    "i got rosenberg s paper , tested the ward identity , and to my astonishment ( and treiman s when i told him the result ) found that it failed !",
    "i soon found that the problem was that my formal proof used a shift of integration variables inside a linearly divergent integral , which ( as i again recalled from student reading ) had been analyzed in an appendix to the classic text of jauch and rohrlich [ ] , with a calculable constant remainder .",
    "for all closed loop contributions to the axial vertex in abelian electrodynamics with larger numbers of vector vertices ( the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ... loops ; see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , the fermion loop integrals for fixed photon momenta are highly convergent and the shift of integration variables needed in the ward identity _ is _ valid , so proceeding in this fermion loop - wise fashion there were apparently no further additional or `` anomalous '' contributions to the axial - vector ward identity . with this fact in the back of my mind",
    "i was convinced from the outset that the anomalous contribution to the axial ward identity would come just from the triangle diagram , with no renormalizations of the anomaly coefficient arising from higher order @xmath4 diagrams with virtual photon insertions .",
    "no sooner was this part of my paper completed than sidney coleman arrived in aspen from europe , and told me that bell and jackiw ( published as bell and jackiw , [ ] ) had independently discovered the anomalous behavior of the @xmath4 triangle graph , in the context of a sigma model investigation of the veltman [ ] sutherland [ ] theorem stating that @xmath22 decay is forbidden in a pcac calculation .",
    "the sutherland ",
    "veltman theorem is a kinematic statement about the @xmath4 three - point function , which asserts that if the momenta associated with the currents @xmath23 are respectively @xmath24 , then the requirement of gauge invariance on the vector currents forces the @xmath4 vertex to be of order @xmath25 in the external momenta .",
    "hence when one applies a divergence to the axial - vector vertex and uses the standard pcac relation ( with the quark current @xmath26 the analog of @xmath27 ) @xmath28 with @xmath29 the pion field and @xmath30 the charged pion decay constant , one finds that the @xmath22 matrix element is of order @xmath31 , and hence vanishes in the soft pion limit @xmath32 . bell and",
    "jackiw analyzed this result by a perturbative calculation in the @xmath33-model , in which pcac is formally built in from the outset , and found a non - vanishing result for the @xmath22 amplitude , which they traced back to the fact that the regularized @xmath4 triangle diagram can not be defined to satisfy the requirements of both pcac and gauge invariance .",
    "this constituted the `` pcac puzzle '' referred to in the title of their paper .",
    "they then proposed to modify the original @xmath33-model by adding further regulator fields with mass - dependent coupling constants in such a manner as to simultaneously enforce gauge invariance and pcac , thus enforcing the sutherland - veltman prediction of a vanishing @xmath22 decay amplitude . in the words of bell and jackiw in their paper , `` it has to be insisted that the introduction of this mass dependence of coupling constants is not an arbitrary step in the pcac context .",
    "if a regularization is introduced to define the theory , it must respect any formal properties which are to be appealed to . '' and again in concluding their paper , they stated `` to the complaint that we have changed the theory , we answer that only the revised version embodies simultaneously the ideas of pcac and gauge invariance . ''",
    "it was immediately clear to me , in the course of the conversation with sidney coleman , that introducing additional regulators to eliminate the anomaly would entail renormalizability problems in @xmath33 meson scattering , and was not the correct way to proceed .",
    "however , it was also clear that bell and jackiw had made an important observation in tying the anomaly to the sutherland ",
    "veltman theorem for @xmath22 decay , and that i could use the sigma - model version of eq .",
    "( [ aid ] ) to get a nonzero prediction for the @xmath22 amplitude , with the whole decay amplitude arising from the anomaly term .",
    "i then wrote an appendix to my paper ( pages 2434 - 2438 ) , clearly delineated from the manuscript that i had finished before sidney s arrival , in which i gave a detailed rebuttal of the regulator construction , by showing that the anomaly could not be eliminated without spoiling either gauge - invariance or renormalizability .",
    "( in later discussions i added unitarity to this list , to exclude the possibility of canceling the anomaly by adding a term to the axial current with a @xmath34 singularity . )",
    "in this appendix i also used an anomaly modified pcac equation @xmath35 with @xmath36 a constant determined by the constituent fermion charges and axial - vector couplings , to obtain a pcac formula for the @xmath22 amplitude @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 the pion mass ) @xmath39 although the axial anomaly , in the context of breakdown of the `` pseudoscalar - pseudovector equivalence theorem '' , had in fact been observed much earlier , starting with fukuda and miyamoto [ ] and steinberger [ ] and continuing to schwinger [ ] , my paper broke new ground by treating the anomaly neither as a baffling calculational result , nor as a field theoretic artifact to be eliminated by a suitable regularization scheme , but instead as a real physical effect ( breaking of classical symmetries by the quantization process ) with observable physical consequences .",
    "this point of view was not immediately embraced by everyone else . after completing my appendix",
    "i sent bell and jackiw copies of my longhand manuscript , and an interesting correspondence ensued . in a letter dated",
    "august 25 , 1968 , jackiw was skeptical whether one could extract concrete physical predictions from the anomaly , and whether one could augment the divergence of the axial - vector current by a definite extra electromagnetic contribution , as in the modified pcac equation of eq .",
    "( [ dip ] ) .",
    "bell , who was traveling , wrote me on sept . 2 , 1968 , and was more appreciative of the possibility of using a modified pcac to get a formula for the neutral pion decay amplitude , writing `` the general idea of adding some quadratic electromagnetic terms to pcac has been in our minds since sutherland s @xmath40 problem .",
    "we did not see what to do with it . ''",
    "he also defended the approach he and jackiw had taken , writing `` the reader may be left with the impression that your development is contradictory to ours , rather than complementary .",
    "our first observation is that the @xmath33 model interpreted in a conventional way just does not have pcac .",
    "this is already a resolution of the puzzle , and the one which you develop in a very nice way .",
    "we , interested in the @xmath33-model only as exemplifying pcac , choose to modify the conventional procedures , in order to exhibit a model in which general pcac reasoning could be illustrated in explicit calculation . '' in recognition of this letter from john bell , whom i revered , i added a footnote 15 to my manuscript saying `` our results do not contradict those of bell and jackiw , but rather complement them .",
    "the main point of bell and jackiw is that the @xmath33 model interpreted in the conventional way , does not satisfy the requirements of pcac .",
    "bell and jackiw modify the @xmath33 model in such a way as to restore pcac .",
    "we , on the other hand , stay within the conventional @xmath33 model , and try to systematize and exploit the pcac breakdown . ''",
    "this footnote , which contradicts statements made in the text of my paper , has puzzled a number of people ; in retrospect , rather than writing it as a paraphrase of bell s words , i should have quoted directly from bell s letter .    following this correspondence ,",
    "my paper was typed on my return to princeton and was received by physical review on sept .",
    "24 , 1968 .",
    "( bell and jackiw s paper [ ] , a cern preprint dated july 16 , 1968 , was submitted to il nuovo cimento , and received by that journal on sept .",
    "11 , 1968 ) .",
    "my paper was accepted along with a signed referee s report from bjorken , stating `` this paper opens a topic similar to the old controversies on photon mass and nature of vacuum polarization .",
    "the lesson there , as i ( no doubt foolishly ) predict will happen here , is that infinities in diagrams are really troublesome , and that if the cutoff which is used violates a cherished symmetry of the theory , the results do not respect the symmetry .",
    "i will also predict a long chain of papers devoted to the question the author has raised , culminating in a clever renormalizable cutoff which respects chiral symmetry and which , therefore , removes adler s extra term . ''",
    "thus , acceptance of the point of view that i had advocated was not immediate , but only followed over time . in 1999 , bjorken was a speaker at my 60th birthday conference at the institute for advanced study , and amused the audience by reading from his report , and then very graciously gave me his file copy , with an appreciative inscription , as a souvenir .",
    "the viewpoint that the anomaly determined the @xmath22 decay amplitude had significant physical consequences . in the appendix to my paper , i showed that the value of the parameter @xmath36 implied by the fractionally charged quark model gave a decay amplitude that was roughly a factor of 3 too small , whereas assuming integrally charged quarks gave an amplitude that agreed , within the expected accuracy of pcac , with experiment . in a conference",
    "talk a year later , in september 1969 [ ] i reviewed the situation , and noted that the integrally charged triplet model of han and nambu [ ] ( see also tavkhelidze [ ] ) also agreed with the experimental neutral pion decay amplitude .",
    "these were the first indications that neutral pion decay provides empirical evidence for what we now call the `` color '' degree of freedom of the strong interactions .",
    "for recent archive reprintings of some of the seminal papers on color , see bardeen , fritzsch , and gell - mann ( hep - ph/0211388 ) and fritzsch and gell - mann ( hep - ph/0301127 ) .",
    "standard references for anomaly physics as of 1970 are my brandeis lectures [ ] and jackiw s brookhaven lectures [ ] .    before leaving the subject of the early history of the anomaly and its antecedents , perhaps this is the appropriate place to mention the paper of johnson and low [ ] , which showed that the bjorken [ ] johnson  low [ ] ( bjl ) method of identifying formal commutators with an infinite energy limit of feynman diagrams gives , in significant cases , results that differ from the naive field - theoretic evaluation of these commutators .",
    "this method was later used by jackiw and johnson [ ] and by boulware and myself ( adler and boulware [ ] ) to show that the @xmath4 axial anomaly can be reinterpreted in terms of anomalous commutators .",
    "this line of investigation , however , did not readily lend itself to a determination of anomaly effects beyond leading order .",
    "for example , i still have in my files an unpublished manuscript ( circa 1966 ) attempting to use the bjl method to tackle a simpler problem , that of proving that the schwinger term in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is a @xmath41-number to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "i believe that this result is true ( and it may well have been proved by now using operator product expansion methods ) , but i was not able at that time to achieve sufficient control of the bjl limits of high order diagrams with general external legs to give a proof .",
    "we are now ready to turn to our main story , the determination of anomalies beyond leading order in perturbation theory . before the neutral pion low energy theorem could be used as evidence for the charge structure of quarks , one needed to be sure that there were no perturbative corrections to the anomaly and the low energy theorem following from it . as i noted above ,",
    "the fermion loop - wise argument that i used in my original treatment left me convinced that only the lowest order @xmath4 diagram would contribute to the anomaly , but this was not a proof .",
    "this point of view was challenged in the article by jackiw and johnson [ ] , received by the physical review on nov .",
    "25 , 1968 , who stated `` adler has given an argument to the end that there exist no higher - order effects .",
    "he introduced a cutoff , calculated the divergence , and then let the cutoff go to infinity .",
    "this is seen in the present context to be equivalent to the second method above",
    ". however , we believe that this method may not be reliable because of the dependence on the order of limits . '' and in their conclusion , they stated `` in a definite model the nature of the modification ( to the axial - vector current divergence equation ) can be determined , but in general only to lowest order in interactions '' .",
    "this controversy with jackiw and johnson was the motivation for a more thorough analysis of the nonrenormalization issue undertaken by bill bardeen and myself in the fall and winter of 19681969 ( adler and bardeen [ ] ) and was cited in the `` acknowledgments '' section of our paper , where we thanked `` r. jackiw and k. johnson for a stimulating controversy which led to the writing of this paper . ''    the paper with bardeen approached the problem of nonrenormalization by two different methods .",
    "we first gave a general constructive argument for nonrenormalization of the anomaly to all orders , in both quantum electrodynamics and in the @xmath33-model in which pcac is canonically realized , and we then backed this argument up with an explicit calculation of the leading order radiative corrections to the anomaly , showing that they cancelled among the various contributing feynman diagrams .",
    "the strategy of the general argument was to note that since eqs .",
    "( [ aid ] ) and ( [ dip ] ) involve unrenormalized fields , masses , and coupling constants , these equations are well defined only in a cutoff field theory .",
    "thus , for both electrodynamics and the @xmath33-model , we constructed cutoff versions by introducing photon or @xmath33-meson regulator fields with mass @xmath42 .",
    "( this was simple for the case of electrodynamics , but more difficult , relying heavily on bill bardeen s prior experience with meson field theories , in the case of the @xmath33-model . ) in both cases , the cutoff prescription allows the usual renormalization program to be carried out , expressing the unrenormalized quantities in terms of renormalized ones and the cutoff @xmath42 . in the cutoff theories ,",
    "the fermion loop - wise argument i used in my original anomaly paper is still valid , because regulating boson propagators does not alter the chiral symmetry properties of the theory , and thus it is straightforward to prove the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ aid ] ) and ( [ dip ] ) for the unrenormalized quantities to all orders of perturbation theory .    taking the vacuum to two @xmath43 matrix element of the anomaly equations , and applying the sutherland ",
    "veltman theorem , which asserts the vanishing of the matrix element of @xmath44 at the special kinematic point @xmath45 , bardeen and i then got exact low energy theorems for the matrix elements @xmath46 ( in electrodynamics ) and @xmath47 ( in the @xmath33-model ) of the `` naive '' axial - vector divergence at this kinematic point , which were given by the negative of the corresponding matrix element of the anomaly term . however , since we could prove that these matrix elements are finite in the limit as the cutoff @xmath42 approaches infinity , this in turn gave exact low energy theorems for the renormalized , physical matrix elements in both cases .",
    "one subtlety that entered into the all orders calculation was the role of photon rescattering diagrams connected to the anomaly term , but using gauge invariance arguments analogous to those involved in the sutherland ",
    "veltman theorem , we were able to show that these diagrams made a vanishing contribution to the low energy theorem at the special kinematic point @xmath45 .",
    "thus , my paper with bardeen provided a rigorous underpinning for the use of the @xmath22 low energy theorem to study the charge structure of quarks .    in our explicit second order calculation , we calculated the leading order radiative corrections to this low energy theorem , arising from addition of a single virtual photon or virtual @xmath33-meson to the lowest order diagram .",
    "we did this by two methods , one involving a direct calculation of the integrals , and the other ( devised by bill bardeen ) using a clever integration by parts argument to bypass the direct calculation .",
    "both methods gave the same answer : the sum of all the radiative corrections is zero , as expected from our general nonrenormalization argument .",
    "we also traced the contradictory results obtained in the paper of jackiw and johnson to the fact that these authors had studied an axial - vector current ( such as @xmath48 in the @xmath33-model ) that is not made finite by the usual renormalizations in the absence of electromagnetism ; as a consequence , the naive divergence of this current is not multiplicatively renormalizable . as we noted in our paper , `` in other words ,",
    "the axial - vector current considered by jackiw and johnson and its naive divergence are not well - defined objects in the usual renormalized perturbation theory ; hence the ambiguous results which these authors have obtained are not too surprising . ''",
    "our result of a definite , unrenormalized low energy theorem , we noted , came about because `` in each model we have studied a _",
    "particular _ axial - vector current : in spinor electrodynamics , the usual axial - vector current ... and in the @xmath33 model the polkinghorne [ ] axial - vector current ... which , in the absence of electromagnetism , obeys the pcac condition . ''",
    "it is these axial - vector currents that obey a simple anomaly equation to all orders in perturbation theory , and which give an exact , physically relevant low energy theorem for the naive axial - vector divergence .",
    "this paper with bill bardeen should have ended the controversy over whether the anomaly was renormalized , but it did nt .",
    "johnson pointed out in an unpublished report that since the anomaly is mass - independent , it should be possible to calculate it in massless electrodynamics , for which the naive divergence @xmath49 vanishes and the divergence of the axial - vector current directly gives the anomaly .",
    "moreover , in massless electrodynamics there is no need for mass renormalization , and so if one chooses landau gauge for the virtual photon propagator , the second order radiative correction calculation becomes entirely ultraviolet finite , with no renormalization counter terms needed .",
    "such a second order calculation was reported by sen [ ] , a johnson student , who claimed to find nonvanishing second order radiative corrections to the anomaly . however , the calculational scheme proposed by johnson and used by sen has the problem that , while ultraviolet finite , there are severe infrared divergences , which if not handled carefully can lead to spurious results . after a long and arduous calculation ( adler , brown , wong , and young [ ] ) my collaborators and i were able to show that the zero mass calculation , when properly done , also gives a vanishing second order radiative correction to the anomaly .",
    "this confirmed the result i had found with bardeen , which had by then also been confirmed by different methods in the @xmath50 theory in papers of abers , dicus , and teplitz [ ] and young , wong , gounaris , and brown [ ] .    a second challenge to the nonrenormalization calculation that bardeen and",
    "i had done came from deraad , milton , and tsai [ ] , a group associated with julian schwinger at ucla ( preprint received by physical review march 27 , 1972 ; revised version received by physical review may 1 , 1972 , and a second paper ( milton , tsai , and deraad [ ] ) with further calculational details written shortly afterwards ) .",
    "they calculated the radiative corrected low energy theorem using a source - theoretic method , and in their preprint , they claimed a renormalization factor of @xmath51 , in disagreement with what bardeen and i , and other groups , had found .",
    "i learned of their work from bing - lin young ( one of my collaborators in the @xmath52 calculation ) , who wrote to me on march 29 , 1972 , asking me to look at the ucla group s preprint , a copy of which he enclosed .",
    "i did a short calculation , and then in conversations with the ucla group pointed out that they had imposed an _ ad hoc _ normalization condition on the pseudoscalar vertex @xmath53 associated with the naive divergence @xmath49 .",
    "however , the anomalous ward identity for the axial - vector vertex part uniquely specifies the normalization to be used , since at @xmath54 in momentum space both the @xmath44 terms and the anomaly term vanish , and one is left with @xmath55 .",
    "this equation relates the normalization of @xmath56 to that of the electron propagator @xmath57 , and must be used as the normalization of the pseudoscalar vertex in computing radiative corrections to the low energy theorem ( see equations ( 26 ) through ( 29 ) of my paper with bardeen [ ] ) , even though it gives an infrared singular value for the on - shell vertex part @xmath56 .",
    "deraad , milton , and tsai in the revised , published version of their paper [ ] , which acknowledged conversations with me , recalculated their results for a general @xmath53 normalization point and found a radiative correction @xmath58 , with @xmath59 a parameter related to the normalization point .",
    "they showed that the normalization that bardeen and i had used corresponded to @xmath60 , that is , no radiative correction , in agreement with our calculational result , whereas their original choice of normalization at zero momentum transfer squared corresponded to @xmath61 .",
    "they then argued that since the normalization that bardeen and i had used corresponds to normalization at an infrared sensitive four momentum transfer @xmath62 , with @xmath3 the fictitious photon mass , their normalization choice of zero four momentum transfer squared is more natural .",
    "however , this argument is spurious because the infrared sensitivity on which it is based is an artifact of the calculational method that they used .",
    "in fact , the vacuum to two photon matrix element of the naive divergence is completely infrared finite , since any sensitive dependence on the fictitious photon mass used to calculate vertex parts and electron propagators cancels around the closed electron loop .",
    "hence there is no justification for using a normalization convention differing from the one explicitly specified by the axial - vector ward identity . of course , if one insists on using a different normalization from that determined by the ward identity , a non - vanishing radiative correction to the anomaly will result .",
    "as far as i can tell , schwinger never accepted the nonrenormalization of the anomaly ( see the schwinger biography by mehra and milton [ ] , footnote on page 488 , and pp .",
    "298 - 310 of schwinger [ ] ) .",
    "long before these events , however , the analysis of anomaly renormalization by calculation of higher order feynman diagrams had been rendered obsolete by new , non - perturbative methods .",
    "zee [ ] and lowenstein and schroer [ ] gave direct proofs of chiral anomaly non - renormalization in qed starting from the then recently discovered callan - symanzik equations , and an alternative argument was given in the book of collins [ ] .",
    "( for extensions to the @xmath33-model , see also becchi [ ] and shei and zee [ ] . ) before describing zee s argument , let me make some technical comments about the three proofs . in the paper of zee",
    "the operator @xmath71 is to be understood as the `` naive '' divergence of the axial - vector current ; in the paper of schroer and lowenstein this identification is made explicit .",
    "( when zee s argument is applied to prove nonrenormalization of a flavor non - singlet current to all orders in strong interactions , this clarification is not needed , since the only anomaly term in the axial - vector divergence then is electromagnetic , and can be neglected in a strong interaction calculation . however ,",
    "when zee s argument is applied to prove anomaly nonrenormalization in qed , the specification that @xmath71 is just the naive divergence is needed . )",
    "the papers of zee and of schroer and lowenstein both work at the point @xmath45 where the naive divergence is related to the anomaly coefficient .",
    "collins , by contrast , gives an argument based on renormalization properties of the axial - vector vertex holding at a general value of @xmath72 . in his presentation , collins specializes to flavor non - singlet axial - vector currents in qcd , such as the flavor @xmath73 octet current @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ dip ] ) , which permits him to ignore complications arising from the gluon rescattering contributions considered by by anselm and iogensen .",
    "however , the collins version of zee s proof can be extended to singlet currents , such as the axial - vector current in qed or the flavor singlet @xmath21 axial - vector current in qcd , by replacing the general axial - vector vertex in his argument by the _ two photon irreducible _ axial - vector vertex ( or its analog in qcd ) .",
    "( the general @xmath4 three - point function , without a two - photon irreducible restriction , is obtained from this simpler three - point function by summing over the possibilities of zero , one , two , ... photon - photon rescatterings as shown in fig .",
    "the anomaly associated with the two - photon irreducible @xmath4 three - point function directly corresponds to the _ operator _ anomaly , since diagrams that iterate the two - photon irreducible three - point function with photon rescatterings , as in fig .",
    "3 , are in one - to - one correspondence with diagrams that iterate the operator anomaly with photon rescatterings .",
    "briefly , zee s argument is based on consideration of the three - point function @xmath74 formed from the naive axial current divergence and from vector currents carrying four - momenta @xmath75 , @xmath76 , which he denotes in momentum space by @xmath77 . from a combination of the callan - symanzik equation for this three - point function , and the ward identity for the four - point function obtained by inserting a scalar current in this three - point function , zee establishes the formula @xmath78 hence expanding in powers of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , by writing @xmath79 , the coefficient @xmath80 of the leading term obeys @xmath81 since the dimensionless coefficient @xmath80 must be independent of @xmath82 , this implies that @xmath83 , and so @xmath80 has no dependence on @xmath84 ! as zee notes in his paper ,",
    "this argument extends readily to theories in which there is more than one nonvanishing mass , since there are then additional renormalization group equations to give constraints .",
    "thus , the renormalization group argument shows that the low energy theorem for the naive divergence , and correspondingly the coefficient of the operator anomaly , is given by the lowest order triangle contribution , and extends the adler - bardeen theorem to rule out even non - perturbative renormalizations of the anomaly .      to conclude this section on the quantum electrodynamics or abelian anomaly",
    ", we mention a recent interesting paper by vainshtein [ ] , and its extension and application to the muon @xmath88 calculation by czarnecki , marciano , and vainshtein [ ] ( see also hep - ph/0310276 ) , and by knecht , perrottet , de rafael , and peris [ ] ( for relevant earlier work by these authors , see [ ] ) .",
    "vainshtein considers the two - photon irreducible triangle @xmath89 with one photon soft , and defines an amplitude @xmath90 obtained from this triangle by contracting it with the soft photon polarization @xmath91 .",
    "this two - index tensor amplitude can be divided into longitudinal and transverse parts . in the chiral ( zero fermion mass ) limit",
    ", there is no naive divergence and so the longitudinal part is given by the anomaly , and is known to all orders .",
    "vainshtein points out that in the chiral limit , there is a crossing symmetry relating the vector and axial - vector indices @xmath3 and @xmath33 , since the @xmath92 in the axial vertex with index @xmath3 can be freely anticommuted through fermion propagators and vector vertices until it is part of the external vector vertex with index @xmath33 .",
    "applying this crossing symmetry to the absorptive part of @xmath90 , together with a dispersion relation argument , implies that the transverse part @xmath93 of @xmath90 is equal to one half of the longitudinal part @xmath94 , and thus also has no perturbative radiative corrections in higher orders . as discussed in the second paper cited above ,",
    "this result has applications to the calculation of hadronic corrections to the muon @xmath88 , in which a triangle diagram is joined to the muon line by a virtual photon and a virtual @xmath95 intermediate boson .",

    "what to me was an interesting irony emerged from learning of the connection between anomalies and the famous schwinger paper [ ] on vacuum polarization .",
    "i had in fact read section ii and the appendices of the 1951 paper , when alfred goldhaber and i , during our senior year at harvard ( 1960 - 61 ) , did a reading course on quantum electrodynamics with paul martin , which focused on papers in schwinger s reprint volume ( schwinger [ ] ) .",
    "paul had told us to read the parts of the schwinger paper that were needed to calculate the @xmath99 vacuum polarization loop , but to skip the rest as being too technical .",
    "reading section v of schwinger s paper brought back to mind a brief , forgotten conversation i had had with jack steinberger , who was director of the varenna summer school in 1967 .",
    "steinberger had told me that he had done a calculation on the pseudovector - pseudoscalar equivalence theorem for @xmath22 , but had gotten different answers in the two cases ; also that schwinger had claimed to reconcile the answers , but that he ( steinberger ) could nt make sense out of schwinger s argument .",
    "jack had urged me to look at it , which i never did until getting the jackiw ",
    "johnson preprint , but in retrospect everything fell into place , and the connection to schwinger s work was apparent .",
    "this now brings me to the question , did schwinger s paper constitute the discovery of the anomaly ? both jackiw , in his paper with johnson , and i were careful to note the connection between schwinger s paper [ ] and the point - splitting derivations of the anomaly , once it was called to our attention . however , recently a number of schwinger s former students have gone further , arguing that schwinger was the discoverer of the anomaly and that my paper and that of bell and jackiw were merely a `` rediscovery '' of a previously known result . for example ,",
    "mehra and milton [ ] refer ( p. 488 ) to `` ... the axial - vector anomaly@xmath100 which he ( schwinger ) had discovered in [ 64 ] ( their reference number for the 1951 paper ) '' , and in the footnote labeled by @xmath100 on the same page say `` as we have noted , stephen adler , john s. bell , and roman jackiw had rediscoverd the anomaly in 1968 '' . in a similar vein ,",
    "when i visited the university of washington a few years ago i noticed a display case that had been set up in the theory wing , featuring the 1951 paper and arguing that schwinger was the discoverer of the anomaly .",
    "the use of a point - splitting method was of course important and fruitful , and in retrospect , the axial anomaly is hidden within schwinger s calculation . but schwinger never took the crucial step of observing that the axial - vector current matrix elements can not , in a renormalizable quantum theory , be made to satisfy all of the expected classical symmetries .",
    "and more specifically , he never took the step of defining a gauge - invariant axial - vector current by point splitting , as in eq .",
    "( [ kit ] ) , which has a well - defined anomaly term in its divergence , as in eq .",
    "( [ aid ] ) , with the anomaly term completely accounting for the disagreement between the pseudoscalar and pseudovector calculations of neutral pion decay .",
    "so i would say that although schwinger took steps in the right direction , particularly in noting the utility of point - splitting in defining the axial - vector current , his 1951 paper _ obscured _ the true physics and does not mark the discovery of the anomaly .",
    "this happened only much later , in 1968 , and led to a flurry of activity by many people .",
    "my view is supported , i believe , by the fact that schwinger s calculation seemed arcane , even to people ( like steinberger ) with whom he had talked about it and to colleagues familiar with his work , and exerted no influence on the field until after preprints on the seminal work of 1968 had appeared .      since in the chiral limit the @xmath4 triangle is identical to an @xmath108 triangle ( by a similar argument to that explained at the end of section  [ anom - non ] , involving anticommutation of a @xmath92 around the loop ) , i knew already in unpublished notes dating from the late summer of 1968 that the @xmath108 triangle would also have an anomaly ; a similar observation was also made by gerstein and jackiw [ ] .",
    "> from fragmentary calculations begun in aspen i suspected that higher loop diagrams might have anomalies as well , so after the nonrenormalization work with bill bardeen was finished i suggested to bill that he work out the general anomaly for larger diagrams .",
    "( i was at that point involved in other calculations with wu - ki tung , on the perturbative breakdown of scaling formulas such as the callan - gross relation . )",
    "i showed bill my notes , which turned out to be of little use , but which contained a very pertinent remark by roger dashen that including charge structure ( which i had not ) would allow a larger class of potentially anomalous diagrams . within a few weeks",
    ", bill carried out a brilliant calculation , by point - splitting methods , of the general anomaly in both the abelian _ and _ the non - abelian cases ( bardeen [ ] ) .",
    "the work discussed in section  [ point - split ] on the use of point - splitting in the abelian case was known to bardeen when he started his calculation , and influenced his choice of methodology .",
    "rather than proceeding directly from feynman diagrams as in my anomaly paper and that of bell and jackiw , he proceeded by combining a generalized version of point splitting with the formal @xmath36-matrix expansion .",
    "( for a subsequent textbook derivation of the general anomaly directly from feynman diagrams , see chapt . 1 of van nieuwenhuizen [ ] .",
    ") bardeen s ingenious adaptation of point - splitting involved using different infinitesimal separations for loops with different numbers of vertices .",
    "thus , he started from the interaction lagrangian @xmath109 , with @xmath110 involving general nonderivative couplings to external scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector fields , and replaced it with @xmath111 with @xmath112 the number of vertices in the loop , and with an average over @xmath113 to be performed after evaluation of the loop .",
    "as explained by bardeen , `` the use of @xmath114 in the definition of the @xmath113 separation is necessary so that loops with different numbers of vertices may be simply related , as needed for the ward identities . ''",
    "there are two distinct lines of argument leading to the conclusion that the non - abelian chiral anomaly also has a nonrenormalization theorem , and is given exactly by bardeen s leading order calculation . the first route parallels that used in the abelian case , involving a loop - wise regulator construction in the proof initially given by bardeen [ ] , followed by explicit fourth order calculation ( chanowitz [ ] ) , an @xmath73 analog of the zee argument using the callan - symanzik equations ( pi and shei [ ] ) , and use of dimensional regularization ( marinucci and tonin [ ] , costa , julve , marinucci , and tonin [ ] ) .",
    "the conclusion in all cases is that the adler - bardeen theorem extends to the non - abelian case .",
    "heuristically , what is happening is that except for a few small one - fermion loop diagrams , non - abelian theories , just like abelian ones , are made finite by gauge invariant regularization of the gluon propagators .",
    "but this regularization has no effect on the chiral properties of the theory , and therefore does not change its anomaly structure , which can thus be deduced from the structure of the few small fermion loop diagrams for which naive classical manipulations break down . for",
    "a later , more mathematically oriented proof , and further references , see lucchesi , piguet , and sibold [ ] .",
    "the second route leading to the conclusion that the non - abelian anomaly is nonrenormalized might be termed `` algebraic / geometrical '' , and consists of two steps .",
    "the first step consists of a demonstration that the higher order terms in bardeen s non - abelian formula are completely determined by the leading , abelian anomaly . during a summer visit to fermilab in 1971 , i collaborated with ben lee , sam treiman , and tony zee [ ] in a calculation of a low energy theorem for the reaction @xmath121 in both the neutral and charged pion cases .",
    "this was motivated in part by discrepancies in calculations that had just appeared in the literature , and in part by its relevance to theoretical unitarity calculations of a lower bound on the @xmath122 decay rate .",
    "using pcac , we showed that the fact that the @xmath123 matrix elements vanish in the limit when a final @xmath124 becomes soft , together with photon gauge invariance , relates these amplitudes to the matrix elements @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 , and moreover , gives a relation between the latter two matrix elements , @xmath129 thus all of the matrix elements in question are uniquely determined by @xmath125 , which itself is determined by the @xmath4 anomaly calculation . an identical result for the same reactions",
    "was independently given by terentev ( terentiev ) [ ] . in the meantime , in a beautiful formal analysis , wess and zumino [ ] showed that the current algebra satisfied by the flavor @xmath73 octet of vector and axial - vector currents implies integrability or `` consistency '' conditions on the non - abelian axial - vector anomaly , which are satisfied by the bardeen formula , and conversely , that these constraints uniquely imply the bardeen structure up to an overall factor , which is determined by the abelian @xmath4 anomaly . by introducing an auxiliary pseudoscalar field , wess and zumino were able to write down a local action obeying the anomalous ward identities and the consistency conditions .",
    "( there is no corresponding local action involving just the vector and axial - vector currents , since if there were , the anomalies could be eliminated by a local counterterm . )",
    "wess and zumino also gave expressions for the processes @xmath130 and @xmath131 discussed by adler et al and terentiev , as well as giving the anomaly contribution to the five pseudoscalar vertex .",
    "the net result of these three simultaneous pieces of work was to show that the bardeen formula has a rigidly constrained structure , up to an overall factor given by the @xmath22 decay amplitude .",
    "the second step in the `` algebraic / geometric '' route to anomaly renormalization is a celebrated paper of witten [ ] , which shows that the wess - zumino action has a representation as the integral of a fifth rank antisymmetric tensor ( constructed from the auxiliary pseudoscalar field ) over a five dimensional disk of which four dimensional space is the boundary .",
    "in addition to giving a new interpretation of the wess - zumino action @xmath132 , witten s argument also gave a constraint on the overall factor in @xmath132 that was not determined by the wess - zumino consistency argument .",
    "witten observed that his construction is not unique , because a closed five - sphere intersecting a hyperplane gives two ways of bounding the four - sphere along the equator with a five dimensional hemispherical disk . requiring these two constructions to give the same value for @xmath133 , which is the way the anomaly enters into a feynman path integral , requires integer quantization of the overall coefficient in the wess - zumino - witten action .",
    "this integer can be read off from the @xmath4 triangle diagram , and for the case of an underlying color @xmath134 gauge theory turns out to be just @xmath135 , the number of colors .",
    "to summarize , the `` algebraic / geometric '' approach shows that the bardeen anomaly has a unique structure , up to an overall constant , and moreover that this overall constant is constrained by an integer quantization condition .",
    "hence once the overall constant is fixed by comparison with leading order perturbation theory ( say in qcd ) , it is clear that this result must be exact to all orders , since the presence of renormalizations in higher orders of the strong coupling constant would lead to violations of the quantization condition .",
    "the fact that non - abelian anomalies are given by an overall rigid structure has important implications for quantum field theory .",
    "for example , the presence of anomalies spoils the renormalizability of non - abelian gauge theories and requires the cancellation of gauged anomalies between different fermion species , , bouchiat , iliopoulos and meyer [ ] , and weinberg [ ] . ] through imposition of the condition @xmath136 for all @xmath137 , with @xmath138 the coupling matrices of gauge bosons to left - handed fermions .",
    "the fact that anomalies have a rigid structure then implies that once these anomaly cancellation conditions are imposed for the lowest order anomalous triangle diagrams , no further conditions arise from anomalous square or pentagon diagrams , or from radiative corrections to these leading fermion loop diagrams . a second place where the one - loop geometric structure of non - abelian anomalies enters is in instanton physics , where the structural match between the instanton action @xmath139 and the anomaly coefficient @xmath140 results in the integral of the anomaly over an instanton being an integer .",
    "this integer can be interpreted as a topological winding number , and through the anomaly leads to a relation between chiral transformations of the fermion fields @xmath141 , and shifts in the theta angle that describes the gauge field vacuum , @xmath142 .",
    "the fact that the non - abelian anomaly is nonrenormalized implies that this relation is exact , and has no higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "i am indebted to hitoshi murayama for this remark on instanton physics .",
    "] yet another place where anomaly nonrenormalization plays a role is in the t hooft anomaly matching conditions ( for a survey and references , see weinberg [ ] , sec .",
    "in an influential paper wilson [ ] proposed the operator product expansion , incorporating ideas on the approximate scale invariance of the strong interactions suggested by mack [ ] . as one of the applications of his technique , wilson discussed @xmath143 decay and the axial - vector anomaly from the viewpoint of the short distance singularity of the coordinate space @xmath4 three - point function . using these methods , crewther [ ] and",
    "chanowitz and ellis [ ] investigated the short distance structure of the three - point function @xmath144 , with @xmath145 the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , and computed the explicit form of its leading order anomaly .",
    "is the `` naive '' trace excluding the electromagnetic anomaly contribution , that is , it only contains hadronic fields .",
    "i wish to thank rod crewther for email correspondence on this point .",
    "( my comment here is analogous to the comment above that @xmath71 in zee s paper [ ] is the `` naive '' divergence . ) ] their calculations confirmed earlier indications of a perturbative trace anomaly obtained in a study of broken scale invariance by coleman and jackiw [ ] .",
    "letting @xmath146 be the momentum space @xmath144 three - point function , and @xmath147 be the corresponding @xmath148 two - point function , the naive ward identity @xmath149 is modified to @xmath150 with the trace anomaly coefficient @xmath151 given by @xmath152 thus , for qed , with a single fermion of charge @xmath153 , the anomaly term is @xmath154 ( p_{\\mu}p_{\\nu}-\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}p^2)$ ] . in a subsequent paper , chanowitz and ellis [ ]",
    "showed that the fourth order trace anomaly can be read off directly from the coefficient of the leading logarithm in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath155 , giving to next order an anomaly coefficient @xmath156 .",
    "thus , their fourth order argument indicated a direct connection between the trace anomaly and the renormalization group @xmath0 function .    although not the historical route , the fact that there is a trace anomaly can also be inferred by inspection of the pauli - villars regulator construction used to define gauge invariant fermion loop diagrams",
    "as pointed out by zumino [ ] and by jackiw [ ] , the axial - vector anomaly can be given a simple interpretation this way .",
    "introducing a pauli - villars fermion of mass @xmath157 , the vacuum to two photon matrix element of the regularized axial - vector divergence equation takes the form @xmath158 the left hand side of this equation approaches the regularized axial - vector divergence as @xmath159 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is well defined by itself and gives the matrix element of the naive axial - vector divergence .",
    "however , gauge invariance combined with dimensional analysis ( or direct calculation ) shows that for large @xmath157 , we have @xmath160 , and so the second term on the right approaches a nonzero limit as @xmath161 , and gives the anomaly contribution .",
    "let us now apply a similar analysis to the vacuum to two photon matrix element of the energy - momentum tensor , defined in a similar way by pauli - villars regularization , @xmath162 with @xmath163 the scalar current . with the imposition of gauge invariance ( to eliminate quadratic divergences ) , the left hand side of this equation approaches the regularized trace of the energy - momentum tensor , and the first term on the right is well defined and gives the matrix element of the naive trace .",
    "however , for the scalar current , gauge invariance combined with dimensional analysis shows that for large @xmath157 , we have @xmath164 , and so the second term on the right approaches a nonzero limit as @xmath161 , and gives the trace anomaly .",
    "pursuing the details by computing the proportionality constants , one sees that eqs .",
    "( [ tap],[ute ] ) give the correct anomaly coefficients in the two cases .",
    "this way of deriving the trace anomaly shows clearly that it is a scalar analog of the pseudoscalar axial - vector anomaly , a fact that will figure in the discussion of anomalies in supersymmetric theories .",
    "my involvement with trace anomalies began roughly five years later , when _ physical review _ sent me for refereeing a paper by iwasaki [ ] . in this paper , which noted the relevance to trace anomalies , iwasaki proved a kinematic theorem on the vacuum to two photon matrix element of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , that is an analog of the sutherland - veltman theorem for the vacuum to two photon matrix element of the divergence of the axial - vector current .",
    "just as the latter has a kinematic zero at @xmath45 , iwasaki showed that the kinematic structure of the vacuum to two photon matrix element of the energy - momentum tensor implies , when one takes the trace , that there is also a kinematic zero at @xmath45 , irrespective of the presence of anomalies ( just as the sutherland - veltman result holds in the presence of anomalies ) . reading",
    "this article suggested the idea that just as the sutherland - veltman theorem can be used as part of an argument to prove nonrenormalization of the axial - vector anomaly , iwasaki s theorem could be used to analogously calculate the trace anomaly to all orders . during the spring of 1976 i wrote an initial preprint attempting an all orders calculation of the trace anomaly in quantum electrodynamics , but",
    "this had an error pointed out to me by baqi bg . over the summer of 1976",
    "i then collaborated with two local postdocs , john collins ( at princeton ) and anthony duncan ( at the institute ) , to work out a corrected version ( adler , collins , and duncan [ ] ) .",
    "collins and duncan simultaneously teamed up with another institute postdoc , satish joglekar , to apply similar ideas to quantum chromodynamics , published as collins , duncan , and joglekar [ ] , and simultaneously the same result for qcd was obtained by n. k. nielsen [ ] .",
    "in section  [ nca ] we saw that the chiral anomaly is given exactly by the one loop calculation , while in section  [ trace ] we saw that the trace anomaly can be calculated exactly in terms of the renormalization group @xmath0-function .",
    "these two results have figured in a large literature dealing with anomalies in supersymmetric theories , and in particular in supersymmetric yang - mills theory , which is the case we shall focus on here ( a similar analysis can be given when supersymmetric matter fields are included ) .",
    "we shall not attempt to cite all of the relevant papers , but note that reviews as of the mid-1980s were given in the comprehensive paper of shifman and vainshtein [ ] , and also in the introductory section of ensign and mahanthappa [ ] .",
    "important recent discussions include shifman s sakurai prize lecture [ ] and the analysis of arkani - hamed and murayama [ ] .",
    "although historically the topic of supersymmetric anomalies initially generated much confusion , as i understand it the current status of the subject can be summarized as follows .      to sum up",
    ", there now appears to be a detailed understanding of the role played by all orders calculations of chiral and trace anomalies in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "in retrospect , the `` supersymmetric anomaly puzzle '' stemmed from the initial , preliminary generalization from known non - supersymmetric results to the supersymmetric case , which suggested that one should find a unique supercurrent with a one - loop anomaly structure .",
    "what one finds , instead , is an equivalence class of supercurrents , differing by the coupling constant definition , with a one - loop anomaly structure _ modulo renormalizations arising from redefinitions of the coupling constant _  different from first expectations , but not that far off .",
    "this contrasts with the all orders anomalies found in qed and qcd , where the trace anomaly is given by a @xmath0 function that is unrelated to the chiral anomaly even at one - loop order , reflecting the fact that these theories are not supersymmetric .",
    "to conclude , i note that i have only touched in this essay on one part of a large subject . for further , detailed discussions of anomalies , see the books of van nieuwenhuizen [ ] and bertlmann [ ] , as well as chapters or sections of the books by weinberg [ ] , makeenko [ ] , volovik [ ] , and zee [ ] , and of a forthcoming book by van nieuwenhuizen .",
