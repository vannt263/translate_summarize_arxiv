    "charge carrier transport in disordered materials - inorganic , organic and biological systems - has been in the focus of intensive experimental and theoretical study for several decades due to various current and potential applications of such materials in modern electronic devices ( see , for instance , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "an essential part of the research is dedicated to studying the mobility of the charge carriers , @xmath0 , and their diffusion coefficient , @xmath1 , as the decisive transport coefficients responsible for the performance of most devices . among other features ,",
    "the relation between these two transport coefficients is the subject of intensive research , since this relation ( called the `` einstein relation '' ) often provides significant information on the underlying transport mechanism.@xcite in numerous experimental studies on organic disordered materials , essential deviations from the conventional form @xmath2 of this relation have been recognized .",

    "deviations from eq .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) were predicted theoretically for non - equilibrium transport at low temperatures @xcite and also for equilibrium transport in degenerate systems if the density of states ( dos ) , which can be used by the charge carriers , strongly depends on energy , for instance , exponentially @xcite or according to a gaussian distribution.@xcite usually the former dos is assumed for inorganic amorphous semiconductors , while the latter one is assumed for disordered organic materials , such as molecularly doped and conjugated polymers.@xcite in this paper and in the following one ( ref . )",
    "we derive general equations for calculating the diffusion coefficient and the mobility of charge carriers and apply them to systems with the gaussian dos , since most of the experimental evidence for the violation of eq .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) has been reported for organic disordered materials .",
    "the dos is taken as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spatial concentration of conducting states and @xmath8 is the energy scale of the dos distribution .",
    "remarkably , experiments on disordered organic materials evidence that at relatively low electric fields , at which the carrier mobility @xmath0 is field - independent and hence the carrier transport can be treated as ohmic one ( low - field regime ) , the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 of charge carriers and concomitantly the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 become essentially dependent on the magnitude of the applied electric field @xmath9.@xcite our aim in this paper and in the following one@xcite is to provide an analytical theory for the field - dependent diffusion coefficient and mobility of charge carriers .",
    "the theory will be checked by computer simulations .",
    "charge transport in disordered organic materials is dominated by incoherent hopping of electrons and holes via localized states randomly distributed in space , with the dos described by eq .",
    "( [ eq - gaussian - dos]).@xcite the transition rate between an occupied state @xmath10 and an empty state @xmath11 , separated by the distance @xmath12 , is described by the miller - abrahams expression @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the attempt - to - escape frequency .",
    "the energy difference between the sites is @xmath15 where the electric field @xmath9 is assumed to be directed along the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the localization length of the charge carriers in the states contributing to hopping transport is @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the latter quantity to be independent of energy and we will neglect correlations between the energies of the localized states , following the gaussian - disorder - model of bssler .",
    "@xcite    the challenging problem arises of how to describe theoretically the field - dependent diffusion of charge carriers in the hopping regime within the gaussian dos .",
    "this very problem was addressed in the numerical simulations by richert _ _ et al.__@xcite using a monte carlo algorithm with a randomly distributed parameter @xmath17 ( the so - called off - diagonal disorder ) , it was shown that the diffusion coefficient for hopping transport in the gaussian dos depends essentially on the field strength at such low electric fields that the mobility of charge carriers remains field - independent.@xcite this result was interpreted in analytical calculations by bouchaud and georges,@xcite who considered a hopping process in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of equidistant localized states with transition rates essentially different from those given by eq .",

    "( [ eq - gaussian - dos ] ) and ( [ eq - miller - abrahams ] ) , which we call the random - energy - model ( rem ) .",
    "bouchaud and georges @xcite suggested for the field - dependent part of the diffusion coefficient in the rbm the expression @xmath21 $ ] , which they claimed to be precisely the dependence found in ref .  .",
    "later the authors of ref .   studied the quantity @xmath22 by computer simulations in more detail @xcite and found a quadratic dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath9 at low fields and no turn - over to a linear field dependence as suggested by bouchaud and georges.@xcite the question arises then on whether this discrepancy in the field dependences of the diffusion constant between the computer simulations @xcite and analytical calculations @xcite is due to different models ( rbm @xcite against rem @xcite ) , or it is due to different dimensionalities considered in these two approaches ( 1d in analytical calculations @xcite against 3d in computer simulations @xcite ) .",
    "the only way to answer this question is to obtain exact results for the rem in 1d and to compare them with the results for the rbm in 1d on one hand and with the results for the rem in 3d on the other hand .",

    "the following paper@xcite is devoted to diffusion in 3d systems .",
    "the results in the 3d case clearly demonstrate a quadratic field dependence of the diffusion coefficient at low fields .",
    "one should then conclude that the discrepancy between the linear @xcite and the quadratic @xcite field dependences of the diffusion constant reported in the literature is due to the different space dimensionalities considered in the two approaches .",
    "one should note that the differences between 1d systems and 3d systems with respect to the field - dependent diffusion coefficient have been reported in the literature , albeit for systems with essential correlations between energies and spatial positions of localized states involved into the hopping transport .",
    "relying essentially on such correlations , parris _",
    "@xcite obtained an exact result for the field - dependent diffusion coefficient in 1d systems , which was not confirmed in computer simulations carried out on 3d correlated systems .",
    "@xcite our study leads to a similar conclusion for the gaussian disorder model without space - energy correlations .",
    "this study was necessary , since the theory from ref .",
    "can not be applied to the case of uncorrelated disorder .",
    "this section is devoted to one - dimensional hopping in the presence of an electric field .",
    "the considered system consists of a chain of sites separated by a constant distance @xmath23 .",
    "each site is either empty or occupied by a carrier .",
    "we consider the limit of small carrier concentration , therefore the probability for the @xmath10th site to be occupied , @xmath24 , is small for each @xmath10 .",
    "the time evolution of probabilities @xmath24 is described by equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the rate of transition from site @xmath10 to site @xmath11 .",
    "transition rates @xmath26 are assumed to be time - independent ; to be non - zero only for nearest neighbors @xmath27 ; and to obey the principle of detailed balance : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy of a carrier on the @xmath10th site _ without _ the electric field , and @xmath9 is the electric field strength .",
    "our aim is to obtain analytical expressions for diffusion coefficients with transition rates @xmath26 chosen according to either rbm or rem .",
    "a similar problem was considered by derrida@xcite who obtained exact results for diffusion coefficient in _ finite _ systems with arbitrarily chosen transition rates .",
    "but , in the limit of an _ infinite _ system , his expression ( eq .  ( 47 ) of ref .  ) contains an uncertainty of type `` @xmath30 '' , and resolving this uncertainty is a non - trivial task",
    ". derrida considered an infinite system only for the case if @xmath26 are random _ independent _ variables , except that only @xmath26 and @xmath31 may be correlated .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for the rbm , but not for the rem , in which @xmath26 and @xmath32 are correlated due to the common site @xmath11",
    ". therefore derrida s approach can hardly be generalized to for the rem .",
    "here we propose another analytical approach for evaluating the diffusion coefficient in the infinite disordered one - dimensional systems .",
    "derrida s method uses a definition of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 related to random walks : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the position of the particle at time @xmath35 . on the contrary",
    ", our method is based on the macroscopic definition of @xmath1 as a ratio of current flow @xmath11 and the long - scale gradient of the concentration @xmath36 of particles : @xmath37 we believe that both methods give the same results , though our method has an advantage of providing an _ explicit _ expression for @xmath1 in the general case of the _ infinite _ one - dimensional system ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2-vd - from - ab ] ) , ( [ eq:2-solution - for - a ] ) , and ( [ eq:2-solution - for - b ] ) below ) .",
    "this expression can be straightforwardly applied to the particular cases of the rbm and rem .",
    "we start by considering the continuous - medium approximation .",
    "this approximation deals with the carrier concentration @xmath38 averaged upon a sufficiently large spatial scale .",
    "the time evolution of this concentration obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath39 provided that @xmath36 varies in space sufficiently slowly ( that is , the characteristic scale of spatial variation is large as compared to the scale of averaging ) . here",
    "@xmath40 is the drift velocity and @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient .",

    "( [ eq:2-fokker - planck ] ) with the initial condition  ( [ eq:2-exp - mu - x ] ) reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 since both @xmath46 and @xmath43 are infinitely small , one can resolve eq .",

    "therefore @xmath50 , and eq .  ( [ eq:2-time - evolution ] ) can be written as @xmath51 this is the way of introducing @xmath46 on a microscopic scale .",
