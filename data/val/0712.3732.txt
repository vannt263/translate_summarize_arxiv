    "in the recent years there has been a lot of progress in understanding running coupling corrections for small-@xmath3 evolution equations .",
    "running coupling corrections to the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite , the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite and the jalilian - marian  iancu  mclerran  weigert  leonidov  kovner ( jimwlk ) @xcite evolution equations were calculated in @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the running coupling corrections to the bk and jimwlk equations significantly improved our ability to make precise predictions for the total cross sections in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) based on the saturation / color glass condensate ( cgc ) physics @xcite .    however , to improve the cgc predictions for other observables , such as the inclusive gluon or quark production cross sections , it is important to understand how the running coupling corrections enter the expressions derived previously for such cross sections @xcite .",
    "it was originally proposed in @xcite that the gluon production cross section can be described by the @xmath4-factorization formula @xmath5 where the gluon is produced with the transverse momentum @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , rapidity @xmath8 in a collision with the total rapidity interval @xmath9 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the unintegrated gluon distribution functions in the projectile and in the target correspondingly .",
    "@xmath12 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath4-factorization ( [ ktfact ] ) has been known to work outside the saturation region @xcite ( e.g. for proton - proton collisions @xmath14 ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the @xmath4-factorization formula ( [ ktfact ] ) holds for gluon production in proton - nucleus ( @xmath15 ) collisions and in dis both in the quasi - classical limit of multiple rescatterings @xcite and after including quantum bk / jimwlk evolution .",
    "this means that works in the kinematic region inside the saturation region for the target and outside the saturation region for the projectile .",
    "( a proton / projectile can be defined as a nucleus with a much smaller saturation scale than in the target nucleus . )",
    "it is at present not clear whether correctly describes gluon production in nucleus - nucleus collisions , i.e. , in the saturation region for both the target and the projectile .    in @xcite",
    "the following relation was also derived between the forward amplitude of a dipole of transverse size @xmath16 scattering on a nucleus at impact parameter @xmath17 and rapidity @xmath8 , @xmath18 , and the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath19 of the same nucleus : @xmath20    it would be very interesting to see if would still hold when running coupling corrections are included .",
    "it would also be interesting to see whether the relation ( [ phi ] ) would survive the inclusion of running coupling corrections .",
    "this would verify the validity of @xmath4-factorization formula ( [ ktfact ] ) and the universality of the dipole amplitude as the correct degree of freedom for both the total dis cross section and for the single gluon production at small-@xmath3 .    to answer the above questions one has to first understand how to include running coupling corrections into the gluon production cross section .",
    "this is a formidable task that we are not going to complete here . instead we will be content with a first step in that direction by resolving some conceptual questions and by setting up a formalism for future calculations .",
    "our main task is to identify the cancellation mechanisms that ensure the ir safety of the total cross section , as it governs all left over phase space cancellations for less inclusive observables and allows us to pinpoint the origin of eventual ir problems .",
    "below we will analyze the running coupling corrections to the one - gluon inclusive production cross section .",
    "our strategy is standard : following brodsky , lepage and mackenzie ( blm ) @xcite we will begin by dressing all the relevant gluon lines and vertices by quark bubble chains , resumming powers of @xmath21 . we will then replace @xmath22 to complete it to the full one - loop qcd beta - function @xmath23 resumming all factors of @xmath24 should replace all factors of the bare coupling constant @xmath25 in the original lowest order expression ( [ ktfact ] ) by the physical couplings .",
    "`` within reasonable bounds . '' our expressions must match these lowest order corrections as exemplified for the running coupling corrections to the non - linear small-@xmath3 evolution in the calculation of the gluonic component of the nlo bfkl , bk , and jimwlk kernels done in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the result of a full nlo calculation confirmed the scale - setting for the running coupling which had been done in @xcite using the blm prescription . ]",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ total ] we will set up the formalism for including quark bubbles in the final state ( the state after the projectile s interaction with the target ) .",
    "we will then analyze the running coupling corrections to gluon production in sect .",
    "[ glue_mult ] .",
    "the main conceptual problem in including running coupling corrections for the gluon production cross section is with insertion of quark bubbles onto the outgoing gluon line ( see below ) .",
    "indeed , if one uses dimensional regularization and the quarks are massless all such bubble corrections are zero , since the on - mass - shell gluon provides no invariant momentum scale .",
    "this zero can be thought about as a `` cancellation '' of the infrared and ultraviolet divergences in the bubbles .",
    "the zero result is unsatisfactory , since it would leave the gluon production cross section proportional to a factor @xmath25 , the bare coupling , and thus _",
    "unrenormalized_.    to resolve this problem we notice that collinear divergences , resulting from gluon splitting into two massless quarks ( or gluons ) come in at the same order in perturbation theory as running coupling corrections on the outgoing gluon line . to keep track of such divergences we regularize them with the infrared cutoff @xmath26 . with",
    "the regulator inserted , we show in sect .",
    "[ glue_mult ] that the bubbles on the outgoing gluon line generate a factor of running coupling @xmath27 with the infrared ( ir ) cutoff in the argument .",
    "therefore , the gluon production cross section has to come in with a factor of the coupling running with some arbitrary ir cutoff in the argument .",
    "indeed the cutoff has a meaning of the resolution scale for gluons : once such a cutoff is introduced , collinear @xmath28 pairs ( and collinear gluon pairs ) are also identified as gluons , generating extra diagrams contributing running coupling corrections ( see ) , which in the end renormalize gluon production cross section .",
    "we conclude that the gluon production cross section depends on the ir cutoff / resolution scale and is thus not infrared - safe , in agreement with conventional wisdom .",
    "our argument shows that the result of the full calculation of the running coupling corrections would necessarily generate a power of @xmath27 .",
    "we expect that , again in line with conventional wisdom , such non - perturbative factors of the coupling could be absorbed into fragmentation functions if hadron production is the goal of a calculation at hand .",
    "the separation of the diagrams into the perturbative cross sections and the fragmentation functions could be done using the conventional approach ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it would result in a factorization scale dependence for both the perturbative cross section and the fragmentation function .",
    "indeed one might worry that when is applied to @xmath15 collisions , the unintegrated gluon distribution in the projectile proton @xmath10 would depend on some non - perturbative scale @xmath29 characterizing the proton , thus making the gluon production cross section in non - perturbative even without the inclusion of running coupling corrections .",
    "this is a legitimate concern , though , for instance , it does not apply to the case of dis , where the scale characterizing the projectile is the photon s virtuality @xmath30 , which makes both @xmath10 and the cross section in perturbative before the inclusion of running coupling corrections .",
    "however , even in the case of dis , running coupling corrections would still lead to the collinear singularities that we discuss below , making the gluon production cross section not infrared - safe .",
    "the problem of applying to @xmath15 collisions is expected to be remedied in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath31 ) collisions or in @xmath15 collisions at very high energies , where the ir - safety of the gluon production cross section at fixed coupling is expected to be imposed by the saturation effects in both the target and the projectile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while we can not prove that here , we also expect the collinear singularities discussed below to arise if one tries to calculate the running coupling corrections to the gluon production in @xmath31 collisions .",
    "we continue our discussion by examining an observable built from quark and gluon production cross sections which is infrared - safe in sect .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "the goal is to show explicitly how the infrared contributions cancel to render the quantity infrared - safe .",
    "the observable is the energy density of the matter produced in a collision . in @xcite",
    "the energy density of the medium produced in a heavy ion collision at the space - time point described by the proper time @xmath32 , space - time rapidity @xmath33 and transverse coordinate @xmath34 was shown to be given by the following formula : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the number of gluons produced with transverse momentum @xmath6 , momentum - space rapidity @xmath8 and at transverse coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "the quark and anti - quark production contributions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are added to the gluon one on the right hand side of .",
    "note that the momentum space rapidity @xmath8 gets replaced by the space - time rapidity @xmath33 in .",
    "the above formula ( [ e ] ) is valid for sufficiently late proper times , @xmath39 with @xmath40 the typical transverse momentum of the produced quarks and gluons .",
    "the corrections to it are suppressed by extra powers of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    ", along with our discussion below , is applicable to the particles produced at central rapidity , i.e. , particles with small-@xmath3 both in the target and the projectile wave functions . is valid not only for heavy ion collisions , but for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and dis collisions as well .    in sect .",
    "[ energy ] we show that the energy density ( [ e ] ) is indeed independent of the ir cutoff @xmath26 by showing that terms in the gluon ( and quark ) multiplicity which depend of this cutoff and which are singular in the @xmath41 limit actually vanish when inserted in using the abstract structure of the equation . in sect .",
    "[ toy_sect ] we demonstrate how these terms vanish in an explicit toy model : we show that collinearly divergent terms have such a @xmath42-dependence , that , when inserted in , they integrate out to zero .",
    "thus energy density is an infrared - finite quantity .",
    "we also argue that the running coupling corrections are included in the expression for the energy density ( [ e ] ) in a manner similar to the total cross section calculation @xcite , since both gluons and quarks are allowed in the final state for either the total cross section or for the energy density .    as an aside we discuss the renormalization of the interaction of the projectile wave function with the target in appendix [ p - np ] using a quark - antiquark dipole as the projectile .",
    "we find how the running coupling corrections enter the glauber - mueller formula ( [ n0 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we obtain that one of the two couplings in the exponent of runs with the inverse transverse size of the dipole , while the other coupling runs with some non - perturbative scale characterizing nucleons in the nucleus , as shown in .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ out ] by discussing our main results and potential future developments .",
    "we begin by analyzing the running coupling corrections to the total cross section arising in the final state .",
    "our discussion will apply to both the cross sections calculated in the quasi - classical approximation of mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model @xcite and to the cross sections where the corrections due to non - linear small-@xmath3 evolution equations @xcite are included . just like in the calculation of the total dipole - nucleus cross section , the corrections due to small-@xmath3 evolution come in through a sequence of longitudinally soft gluon emissions , as only gluonic corrections generate leading logarithms of bjorken @xmath3 ( i.e. powers of @xmath43 ) @xcite . our discussion below",
    "can equally be applied to the quasi - classical gluon production in the mv model , or to the gluon production enhanced by small-@xmath3 evolution corrections , which appears as a quasi - classical gluon emission in one rung of the small-@xmath3 evolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "common to both cases is an eikonal emission vertex for the gluons under consideration .        in @xcite the running coupling corrections to the non - linear small-@xmath3 evolution equations",
    "@xcite were calculated for the first time .",
    "the bk and jimwlk evolution equations were written for the total cross section of a projectile ( dipole ) scattering on a target : therefore the optical theorem is applicable and allows to neglect all the final state interactions .",
    "this was used in  @xcite to specifically discard the final state running coupling corrections . in  @xcite one - loop final state corrections",
    "were studied at order @xmath21 and their cancellation was shown explicitly at that level .",
    "while we indeed expect also the all orders resummed final state fermion bubble insertions to cancel due to the optical theorem , we expect the explicit mechanism of this cancellation to be far from straightforward .",
    "thus we set out to explore how the cancellation works explicitly .",
    "before we begin , let us introduce the notations .",
    "we will consider a high energy proton - nucleus or dis collision and will work in the center of mass frame . in this frame",
    "the incoming proton/@xmath28 dipole ( henceforth referred to as the projectile ) comes in from the light cone time of @xmath44 moving along the @xmath45-axis .",
    "the wave function of the projectile may contain extra gluonic fluctuations .",
    "the projectile scatters on the target instantaneously at the light cone time @xmath46 .",
    "similar to @xcite we will denote the instantaneous interaction with the target by a broad ( blue ) vertical line , as shown in .",
    "the broad ( blue ) line comprises all possible multiple one- and two - gluon exchanges between the nucleons in the target and the projectile ( similar to in the appendix [ p - np ] ) .",
    "these interactions of the target field with projectile constituents or the emitted gluon shown explicitly sum into path ordered exponentials along the projectile light cone direction .",
    "they are indicated for the emitted gluon ( or any explicitly shown interacting quark in what is to follow ) in form of an oval ( red ) mark . after scattering on the target",
    "the system evolves further towards the final state at light cone time @xmath47 .",
    "this final state we will denote by a vertical solid line as shown in and refer to it as the final state cut , as appropriate when talking about diagrammatic contributions to probabilities instead of amplitudes .",
    "the amplitude squared , using a similar notation , is shown in the center of .        there",
    "the light cone time goes from @xmath44 to @xmath48 both in the amplitude and in its complex conjugate . in the case of the projectile dipole one has to sum over all possible emissions of the gluon by the quark and the anti - quark , both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude . in case of the proton projectile",
    "the emissions off all of the valence quarks have to be resummed . to save space",
    "we will introduce an abbreviated notation , shown on the right hand side of .",
    "the disconnected gluon line implies sum over emissions of the gluon by all quarks in the projectile .",
    "the broad ( blue ) line indicates all multiple rescatterings in the amplitude .",
    "this notation also makes it easier to discuss our results in relation to any type of ( small ) projectile .    in the notation of the graph on the right of the optical theorem",
    "can be formulated as follows : to calculate the total scattering cross section the dynamics between @xmath46 and @xmath49 can be ignored .",
    "for instance , if we wanted to find contribution of extra softer gluon emissions to the total cross section , only emissions at light cone time @xmath50 should be included both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "this indeed has been verified in the literature @xcite .",
    "the same property applies to running coupling corrections .",
    "the quark bubbles dressing the gluon line at times @xmath51 do not contribute to the total cross section according to the optical theorem .",
    "such corrections were indeed not included in the calculations of @xcite .",
    "however , these corrections should be included if one is interested in gluon production cross section .",
    "to learn how to best organize a calculation that includes them , we will first see how they cancel in the total cross section .    to set the stage ,",
    "let us briefly recall how the cancellations for the cross section mandated by the optical theorem work at leading order .",

    "this will be the first guiding principle to identify potential cancellations below .",
    "the actual cancellations require further analysis of the integrals associated with the diagrams . if one restricts the sum over the final state phase space , the cancellations are no longer complete .",
    "still , partial cancellations from the phase space regions that have not been excluded from the final state sum remain in effect and only become manifest if one groups the diagrams as shown in  ( [ eq : leading - order - cancellations ] )",
    ".    we will not analyze all contributions exhaustively but rather focus on a number of subsets of the one and two loop fermion bubble insertions that cancel separately in the total cross section to illustrate and identify the basic mechanisms at work .",
    "this will lay the groundwork to allow us to precisely pinpoint the origin of ir divergences , understand how they cancel in the total cross section .",
    "it also allows to understand , for example , the cancellations of uv logarithms of the form @xmath58 present in individual diagrams ( with @xmath59 the renormalization scale , a uv quantity ) from the final result .",
    "all these relationships are a prerequisite for a full calculation of the running coupling corrections that remains beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we begin with a single fermion bubble .",

    "one of the singular denominators corresponds to the intermediate state @xmath60 shown in graph a in .",
    "the light cone energy of the state @xmath60 is identical to that of the final ( outgoing ) state , generating a @xmath61-type singularity coming from the corresponding energy denominator .",
    "this problem has been discussed before in @xcite for small-@xmath3 evolution , and our discussion here will follow the calculations performed in @xcite . to tackle the problem of singularities one has to calculate the energy denominators in the diagram in a starting from the usual feynman perturbation theory .    in going from feynman perturbation theory to lcpt",

    "hence the remaining factors in the diagrams @xmath111 and @xmath112 in are the same as those in the diagrams @xmath68 , @xmath106 and @xmath81 in .",

    "( [ gtoy2 ] ) and ( [ qtoy2 ] ) in we obtain the @xmath0-dependent part of the net parton multiplicity @xmath237 now one can easily see that plugging in and integrating over @xmath42 would give zero contribution to the energy density : @xmath238 the collinearly divergent piece given in integrates out to zero ! this is indeed due to the fact that @xmath239 is _ negative _ for some values of @xmath42 in the range of @xmath240 .",
    "what we have learned from the above toy model is that the collinearly divergent part of the net parton multiplicity @xmath241 , while non - zero , comes with a @xmath42-dependent coefficient , which integrates out to zero when weighed with @xmath42 and integrated over @xmath242 to obtain the energy density using .",

    "we found that both the running coupling corrections and the collinear singularities enter at the same order in the coupling .",
    "therefore , inevitably the gluon multiplicity distribution turns out to be dependent on the infrared cutoff @xmath26 which we inserted to regulate the collinear divergences .",
    "this result is indeed in agreement with the conventional understanding of gluon ( or any other massless parton ) production .",
    "however , when we resumed running coupling corrections ( defined as powers of @xmath245 with @xmath134 later completed to the full beta - function ) to all orders , it turned out that the ir cutoff @xmath26 sets the scale of one of the factors of the running coupling constant , as shown in .",
    "this would indeed make gluon multiplicity distribution not infrared safe .",
    "for hadron production calculations one would expect that the contribution of the collinear singularities could be factored out into the fragmentation function .",
    "we have then proceeded to analyze the effect of collinear singularities on the energy density of the medium produced in the collision as defined by above ( see @xcite ) . in sect .",
    "[ energy ] we show that the energy density @xmath2 is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the energy density is infrared safe .",
    "this result is easy to interpret physically , as collinear splittings , where a gluon splits into two gluons ( or into a @xmath28 pair ) both of which are flying in the same direction , are not going to change the amount of energy density deposited into a given region of space .",
    "we have also clarified how the parton multiplicity in could be divergent due to collinear singularities but give a finite energy density after @xmath42 weighing and integration in .",
    "it turns out , as was shown in sect .",
    "[ toy_sect ] , that the collinearly divergent part of the parton multiplicity comes in multiplied by a function of @xmath42 which , when weighed with @xmath42 and integrated over all @xmath242 , integrates out to zero .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy density in is proportional to another infrared - safe quantity called the energy flow , which was defined in @xcite as a potential signal for the experimental detection of the bfkl evolution in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "collinear singularities modify the proof presented in @xcite of the impossibility of perturbative isotropization ( and thermalization ) in heavy ion collisions which led to . to account for the collinear singularities one has to separate each function @xmath246 employed in @xcite ( with @xmath247 used in place of @xmath248 in @xcite ) into collinearly divergent and finite at @xmath249 ( or @xmath250 ) parts . for the singular part one has to introduce an ir regulator @xmath26 as a mass in the denominator of the propagator of the outgoing gluon ( or quark for the part of the argument made for the quarks ) .",
    "as was shown above in sections [ energy ] and [ toy_sect ] , the terms in @xmath2 which are singular in the @xmath251 limit will vanish after @xmath42-integration . for the remaining collinearly - finite part of the function",
    "@xmath252 the proof continues as was outlined in @xcite .",

    "it would indeed be important for improving our understanding of which part of the contributions can be expected to be made infrared safe by the presence of the saturation scale .",
    "as long as the other contributions can be treated with factorization methods , albeit at the price of having to introduce non - perturbative quantities like fragmentation functions , one arrives at a perturbatively consistent calculational framework . in such a framework ,",
    "knowledge of the scales of the running couplings in the unintegrated gluon distribution functions which enter the @xmath4-factorization formula for gluon production in @xcite , which was shown to be valid for gluon production in @xmath15 collisions and in dis @xcite , is of paramount importance .",
