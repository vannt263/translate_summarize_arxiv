    "in recent years a great attention was paid to the study of josephson junctions ( jjs ) because of their use both as superconducting quantum bits  @xcite and nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices for detecting weak magnetic flux change  @xcite .",
    "this widely used device is very sensitive to magnetic flux change and it is composed by two coupling high - t@xmath0 jjs in a superconducting ring .",
    "jjs are good candidates to realize superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) for quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , they were studied at very low temperature in devices making use of charge  @xcite , flux  @xcite and phase qubits  @xcite . in jjs , working both at high and low temperatures , the environment affects strongly the behavior of the system . in high temperature superconductors ( htss )",
    "the presence of low - frequency noise , whose intensity is related to the fluctuations in the bias current , temperature and magnetic field , was experimentally found  @xcite .",
    "also in the low temperature superconductive devices it is very difficult to avoid the influence of environment that constitutes mainly a decoherence source for the system . in particular , the effects on the coherence time of weak current noise in josephson vortex qubits ( jvqs ) , composed by an uniform long jj , were investigated  @xcite .    in this framework the study of transient dynamics of jjs in the presence of noise sources is very interesting for the understanding of the interaction between these systems and environment . in particular , the effects of noise strongly influence the current - voltage characteristic of jjs  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a jj is studied considering a fictitious brownian particle moving in a washboard potential  @xcite and the behavior of the current - voltage characteristic of a jj is strictly related to the lifetime of the superconductive metastable state of the particle .",
    "the decay of the particle from the metastable state , in fact , depends on the fluctuations of the voltage across the junction .",
    "recently noise induced effects were experimentally observed in underdamped josephson junctions  @xcite , and the switching to resistive state of an annular josephson junction due to thermal activation was analyzed  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the transient dynamics of short overdamped and long jjs under the influence of fluctuating bias current and oscillating potential .",
    "we numerically calculate the lifetime of the superconductive metastable state also called the mean switching time ( mst ) to the resistive state for short jj ( sjj ) and long jj ( ljj ) .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of noise induced effects such as resonant activation ( ra )  @xcite and noise enhanced stability ( nes )  @xcite .",
    "we analyze both the effects of thermal and correlated noise sources . in sjj and ljj",
    "we consider white noise , accounting for the thermal fluctuations , and correlated ( colored ) noise separately .",
    "moreover , in ljj we present an analysis considering together the effects of white and colored noise . for given values of frequency of the driving signal and suitable noise intensity",
    ", we find maxima of the lifetime of the superconductive state .",
    "this is an interesting feature for the study of the coherence time of these devices .",
    "our results hold for low temperature superconducting devices when we consider only the effects of the colored noise , and they can be extended to high temperatures , when both colored and white noise come into play .",
    "the study of sjjs is performed in the framework of the resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model formalism  @xcite . to take into account the transient dynamics of the system , a fluctuating current term in the rsj model equation",
    "is considered .",
    "we obtain the following langevin equation  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the order parameter of the system , that is the phase difference of the wave functions in the ground state between left and right superconductive sides of the junction .",

    "( [ model ] ) is equivalent to the dynamics of a particle of coordinate _",

    "moreover , for higher intensity values ( see fig .",

    "we note a range of frequency ( 0.2 @xmath29 @xmath14 @xmath29 0.8 ) in which mst and sd present a minimum , which indicates the suppression of timing error effects , already found in the presence of white noise  @xcite .",
    "moreover when we consider the ra phenomenon in the presence of colored noise , we find a scaling effect depending on the values of the correlation time . in eq .",
    "( [ sjjcorrfunct ] ) if the correlation time is greater than the characteristic time scale of the system , @xmath10@xmath31@xmath32t - t@xmath33@xmath32 , we obtain @xmath34@xmath9(t)@xmath9(t@xmath33)@xmath35 @xmath36@xmath37/2@xmath10 . by comparison with the correlation function of the white noise , @xmath34@xmath38(t)@xmath38(t@xmath33)@xmath35=@xmath39@xmath40",
    ", we can define the effective intensity of the colored noise scaled by a factor 1/2@xmath10 and equivalent , in this approximation , to the intensity of the white noise @xmath41 we check this equivalence by considering the effect on the system of a white noise with intensity @xmath39=0.005 and a colored noise with intensity @xmath37=0.5 , setting @xmath10=50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a , we report the curves of mst vs @xmath14 calculated for these two values of noise intensity .",
    "we see that for mst less than 50 there is a good agreement between the curves . in these conditions",
    "the evolution occurs with time scale smaller than the correlation time and the system is not affected by the noise memory .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b , we show the behavior of mst as a function of the noise intensity for different values of the correlation time .",

    "the number of simulation ranges from @xmath60 to @xmath25 .",
    "here we study the effects of a correlated noise on the transient dynamics of a ljj , neglecting , in eq .",
    "( [ sgmodel ] ) , the term @xmath57 and considering a fluctuating current signal @xmath56 with correlation function @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the intensity of the correlated noise .",
    "therefore , the current density @xmath56 is subjected to fluctuations that are correlated in time ( colored noise ) , showing a @xmath63-correlated behavior in space ( white noise ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we report the curves of mst vs the length of the junction , in the homogeneous bias current case , for different values of @xmath10 , including white noise ( @xmath64 )  @xcite .",
    "we find a decrease of mst as the intensity of the colored noise @xmath65 increases ( see fig .  [ fig:5]a ( @xmath66 ) and fig .  [ fig:5]b ( @xmath67 ) ) .",
    "moreover , we observe that , for fixed values of the noise intensity , mst increases as the correlation time becomes larger",
    ".    we also present the numerical results for the case of inhomogeneous bias current . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a we show the behavior of mst as a function of the dimensionless length _ l_.",
    "we observe that the curves present a non - monotonic behavior with a maximum in correspondence of @xmath68 .    in order to investigate the presence of ra phenomenon , in eq .",

    "[ fig:6]b and fig .  [ fig:7]a . in both figures",
    "we note the presence of a minimum in the curves of mst vs @xmath14 .",
    "this is the signature of the resonant activation phenomenon .",
    "moreover in fig .",

    "we also investigate the presence of nes for the homogeneous current case in the resistive state ( fig .",

    "[ fig:8]b we find , in all curves , a double peak . the comparison of the two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] shows that the driving signal causes the increase of the two maxima ( see fig .",

    "we note that , using the same noise intensities , for longer junction the decay time is shorter .",
    "this can be explained recalling that the effect of the spatial correlation disappears on a longer distance .",
    "this corresponds to the presence of white noise , which is responsible for faster dynamics and , then , shorter escape time .      in this section",

    "in fact , when @xmath65 is at least five order of magnitude higher than @xmath73 , the curve of mst vs @xmath65 ( empty triangles ) matches with good agreement that ( black circles ) obtained in the absence of white noise ( see fig .",
