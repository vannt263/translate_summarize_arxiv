    "time reversal invariant ( tri ) topological insulators , a class of insulating materials with strong spin orbit coupling , have attracted a great amount of attention in recent years . while clean systems are fairly well understood,@xcite an important theme in current topological insulator research is the study of disorder . besides being crucial for the interpretation of experimental data ,",
    "disorder is of fundamental interest : generically , disorder localizes electron wavefunctions and thus is expected to counteract non - trivial topology , which , as a global property , requires the existence of extended wavefunctions in the valence and conduction bands .",
    "one of the defining properties of strong topological insulator ( sti ) phases is their unusual stability : extended bulk- and gapless edge electronic states persist for weak to moderately strong disorder . with increasing disorder strength , the bulk gap gets filled with localized electronic states , the mobility gap decreases and finally , at the topological phase transition , the mobility gap closes and the surface states at opposite surfaces gap out via an extended bulk wavefunction.@xcite",
    "however , disorder physics in topological insulators is much richer than suggested by the simple scheme above .",
    "a drastic example is provided by the topological anderson insulator transition , where increasing disorder drives an ordinary insulator ( oi ) into a topologically nontrivial phase.@xcite moreover , the role of different disorder types @xcite or spatially correlated disorder @xcite has been addressed in literature .",
    "further , weak topological insulator ( wti ) phases known to be protected by translational symmetry were shown to be surprisingly stable against almost all disorder types allowed by discrete symmetries .",
    "@xcite    one of the challenges in the field of disordered topological insulators is the computation of the @xmath0 invariants that characterize strong and weak topological insulator phases . ( without disorder , the @xmath1 invariants can be computed directly from the band structure.@xcite ) while methods based on exact diagonalization are applicable for two dimensional systems , their performance for three - dimensional systems is rather poor@xcite .",
    "for example , a recent study @xcite was only able to map the @xmath0 invariant for a few lines in the disorder strength ",
    "fermi energy plane for a system of 8x8x8 lattice sites , leaving uncertainties about the possibility to infer qualitative and quantitative behavior in the experimentally relevant thermodynamic limit .",
    "as an example of an indirect method for calculating the @xmath0 invariant , the three - dimensional topological anderson insulator was argued to be topological nontrivial by employing the witten effect.@xcite the transfer - matrix method can be used to obtain lyapunov exponents in a finite - size scaling analysis,@xcite which is then used to infer information on topological phase boundaries .",
    "drawbacks of this method include difficulties in the determination of the phase boundary between two insulating phases , since size dependence of the decay length is intrinsically small on both sides of the transition . in the case of a transition between an insulating topologically trivial and nontrivial phase , application of open boundary conditions",
    "allows for a facilitated detection of the resulting insulator-(surface)metal transition .",
    "however , this causes a much stronger finite - size effect and renders the interpretation of the results for finite system sizes rather difficult .",
    "for example , a recent transfer - matrix study @xcite speculates about a novel `` defeated wti '' region in the phase diagram , whose precise nature and properties have not been finally resolved .    as a numerically inexpensive alternative , fulga _ et al . _",
    "proposed to obtain the topological invariants from a topological classification of the scattering matrix of a topological insulator.@xcite as a fermi surface quantity , the computational requirements for the calculation of the scattering matrix scale favorably , so that it is accessible with modest effort .",
    "the method requires the application of periodic boundary conditions and considers the dependence of the scattering matrix on the corresponding aharonov - bohm fluxes . in two dimensions ,",
    "there is only one flux , and the method effectively classifies a `` topological quantum pump'',@xcite via a mapping similar to that devised by laughlin to classify the integer quantized hall effect.@xcite    in this article , we report on the application of a scattering matrix - based approach to a disordered three - dimensional topological insulator model @xcite that features both strong and weak topological insulator phases . in sec .",
