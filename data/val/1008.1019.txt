    "it has been shown that there are certain advantages in a wideband neutrino beam over a now traditional narrow - band neutrino beam for neutrino oscillation experiments , especially for the observation of @xmath7 oscillation , provided that the baseline is reasonably long ( over 1,000 km )  @xcite . by broadening the range of energies with which multiple oscillations can be resolved , a richer parameter space can become accessible than is available to an experiment focused on only the first oscillation maximum .    in the original paper proposing the use of a wide - band neutrino beam for a very long baseline neutrino oscillation ( vlbno ) experiment  @xcite by the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) neutrino working group ( nwg ) some simplifying assumptions",
    "were used .",
    "the sensitivities presented in the paper relied on calculations based on 4-vector level monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , a simple model for energy resolution and certain assumptions about reconstruction capabilities .",
    "namely , a detailed detector simulation for the proposed water cherenkov detector was not included .",
    "in addition it was assumed that the signal events were only from quasi - elastic ( qe ) charged current ( cc ) scattering ( @xmath8 ) and the background events were only from single @xmath6 neutral current ( nc ) interactions @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nucleons .    in order to gain a better insight on this idea of the vlbno experiment with a wide - band neutrino beam for @xmath5 oscillation , we performed a more sophisticated and elaborate multivariate likelihood based analysis using a full mc simulation that included inelastic neutrino interactions , water cherenkov detector response , and well - tuned event reconstruction algorithms .",
    "this mc simulation and reconstruction programs were developed and fine - tuned for the super - kamiokande - i experiment ( sk - i )  @xcite .",
    "for the discussions in this paper , we calculate a reconstructed neutrino energy using the formula    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nucleon mass , the recoil electron energy and the scattering angle of the recoil electron with respect to the incident neutrino beam , respectively . in a strict sense",
    ", this quantity represents the incident neutrino energy only when the event is produced by cc qe scattering and the fermi motion of target nucleons is ignored .",
    "nonetheless , we show in figure  [ fig : erec ] the neutrino energy and @xmath16 for cc qe ( top ) and all cc ( bottom ) events to compare the two energy distributions for the two classes of cc events .",
    "although @xmath16 for the cc events does not reproduce the incident neutrino spectrum as well as it does for cc qe events , it still reproduces it quite well .",
    "the distributions of neutrino energy ( solid lines ) and reconstructed neutrino energy ( dotted lines ) of single ring e - like events originating from cc qe interactions ( top figure ) and from all cc interactions ( bottom figure ) . note that a dip at about 2 is due to @xmath5 neutrino oscillation .",

    "note that a dip at about 2 is due to @xmath5 neutrino oscillation .",
    "the open square boxes with error bars indicate statistical uncertainties.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the initial event selection is made to maximize the number of interactions that are consistent with coming from @xmath4 appearing at the far end of the baseline in the beam while minimizing events such as @xmath17 cc or any events from nc interactions .",
    "needless to say , the clearest event signature comes from @xmath4 cc qe interactions .",
    "inelastic @xmath4 cc events also carry information about oscillations but are more difficult to cleanly select and have somewhat worse energy resolution as shown in figure  [ fig : erec ] .",
    "regardless of the interaction , a recoil proton will rarely be above its cherenkov threshold of about 1.25 @xmath18 and will not contribute notably to the event signature .",
    "for these reasons , a @xmath4 appearance candidate event will be initially selected if its signature is consistent with being a cherenkov radiation pattern from a single electron ( termed _ single ring , e - like _ ) .",
    "a @xmath17 cc qe event will usually be distinguishable from one arising from a @xmath4 cc qe interaction as the resulting cherenkov ring produced by @xmath17 will have a sharper rise and fall in the amount of cherenkov light at the edges of the ring than one due to an electron .",
    "this is because a muon presents a relatively straight line source of cherenkov light while an electron initiates an electromagnetic shower .",
    "this shower consists of a distribution of track directions due to the number of particles in the shower and that they experience larger multiple scattering .",
    "as the muon energy approaches the cherenkov threshold there is an increasing chance that multiple scattering and the collapsing cherenkov light cone will smooth the rise of the edge of the ring and potentially mimic an electron .",
    "likewise , inelastic and nc interactions with a non - zero pion multiplicity can have additional light that is not consistent with the pattern of a single e - like ring .",
    "depending on the exact event topology these events are either easily ruled out or present challenging backgrounds . charged pions above their cherenkov threshold of 160 /c produce a @xmath19-like ring and are rejected .",
    "events with visible light from both pions and the primary charged lepton are strongly rejected based on ring counting .",
    "events with a final state consisting of only a single neutral pion present a particular challenge .",
    "the @xmath6 decays to a pair of gamma rays , each of which initiate an electromagnetic shower and produce an e - like ring of varying intensity and direction .",
    "these @xmath6 events can become background depending on how the @xmath6 decays to two gamma rays . at one extreme , the decay is symmetric such that the gamma rays have similar energies .",
    "if the original @xmath6 is boosted enough , the two gamma rays are nearly collinear and produce mostly overlapping rings .",
    "they can then be impossible to be distinguished single electron events with an energy equal to the sum of the two gammas . at the other extreme , a highly asymmetric @xmath6 decay results in one strongly boosted and one strongly retarded gamma ray . in the lab frame",
    ", the higher energy gamma will produce a single e - like ring while the other may produce no discernible light .",
    "the events with a @xmath6 in the final state can come from two sources : ( 1 ) nc interactions and ( 2 ) charge exchanges of charged pions inside the target nucleus or with an oxygen or a hydrogen nucleus while traveling in water",
    ".    finally , there are events from electron neutrino interactions that are not from @xmath4 that appeared in the beam from neutrino oscillation @xmath20 .",
    "rather , there is an intrinsic @xmath4 component in the unoscillated neutrino beam originating from muon or kaon decays .",
    "the beam used in this study has an intrinsic @xmath4 component which is 0.7% of the @xmath17 flux .",
    "the background events from these neutrinos are irreducible .    in this analysis , to classify the events for the initial selection , the reconstruction algorithms used for the sk - i atmospheric neutrino analysis are employed .",
    "in addition , a special algorithm called  @xcite is used .",
    "this algorithm has been found to be extremely useful for removing single @xmath6 background events in samples containing events that are classified as single - ring and e - like  @xcite by the standard sk-1 reconstruction .",
    "this paper describes how information provided by , together with other useful variables , can be effectively used to significantly reduce the @xmath6 background while retaining a sufficient efficiency for the signal .",
    "the monte carlo event sample used in this study was originally produced by the sk - i collaboration to simulate atmospheric neutrino events detected by the sk - i detector and corresponds to about 100 years of the exposure .",
    "the detailed description of the monte carlo generation as well as the event reconstruction is described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra for @xmath17 and @xmath4 produced in the earth s atmosphere are different from those in the neutrino beam proposed by the bnl nwg . to account for this",
    ", each @xmath17 event is given a weight based on the neutrino energy such that the shape of the resulting spectrum matches that expected from the beam .",
    "an additional normalization is applied so that the total number of @xmath17 cc qe events is as expected .    assuming no oscillations , it is expected that there will be 12,000 such events for a detector with sk - i efficiencies and fiducial volume of 500 kton ( 22.2 @xmath21 sk - i ) which is placed 2,540 km from the neutrino production target and for five years of running as described in the paper by bnl nwg  @xcite .",
    "when oscillations are applied , this sample is weighted by the oscillation probability taking into account full three - neutrino mixing and matter effects .",
    "the oscillated @xmath4 sample is prepared by similarly weighting and normalizing the @xmath4 atmospheric mc events to what is expected from the @xmath17 component of the beam , that is , under the assumption of 100% @xmath22 oscillation .",
    "actual oscillation parameters are then applied to this sample by weighting to the appropriate oscillation probability .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath4 component in the beam is taken to be the shape predicted by the beam mc simulation and is normalized to be 0.7% that of the @xmath17 component . to include the effect of neutrino oscillation , the contribution of the @xmath4 component is calculated only when @xmath4 survives as @xmath4 at the water cherenkov detector placed at a given baseline .",
    "the expected numbers of the events to be observed from the intrinsic anti-@xmath17 component of the beam are estimated to be 2.2% and 2.5% of the expected numbers of the background events from the @xmath17 ( background-1 ) for the baselines of 2,540 km and of 1,480 km , respectively ( see the next section for the description about the baseline ) .",
    "the expected numbers of the events to be observed from anti-@xmath4 component of the beam are estimated to be less than 4.5% and 4.3% of the expected numbers of the background events from the intrinsic @xmath4 component of the beam ( background-2 ) for the baselines of 2,540 km and of 1,480 km , respectively .",
    "since these contributions are much smaller than the events from the background-1 and the background-2 , although not negligible , we will not take into account them further in this report .    to select mc @xmath4 appearance candidate events an initial set of cuts based on the standard sk - i codes",
    "is used : ( a ) there is one and only one e - like ring , ( b ) the reconstructed event vertex is at least 2 m from any inner photomultiplier ( pmt ) surface and ( c ) there is no activity in the outer ( veto ) detector .",
    "in addition to these standard cuts , events produced by neutrinos with energies greater than 10 are ignored due to lack of statistics in the atmospheric mc sample .",
    "the beam has a tail that extends up to 15 but its contribution to the background is negligible as will be shown below .",
    "the oscillation probabilities applied to the components of the beam neutrino flux use the following parameters :    [ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]",
    "it is interesting to see what the effect of the detector size has on the performance of .",
    "although the results reported so far are based on the analyses of the monte carlo events generated for the super - kamiokande detector with 40% pmt coverage , we can make some assessment of the effect of a larger , more granular detector by imposing a cut on the distance to the pmt surface from the @xmath6 production point in the direction of the @xmath6 ( ) .",
    "for this study we use single @xmath6 events produced by nc interactions . when the @xmath6 energy is about 1 , the minimum opening angle of two photons is about 20@xmath23 and less at higher energies . as gets larger ,",
    "the number of pmts that detect cherenkov photons increases ( improved granularity ) which can help to resolve light patterns .",
    "two negative impacts compete with this effect .",
    "the cherenkov cone is more spread out so less light is seen by any one pmt .",
    "the light must travel further and is thus more subject to absorption and scattering ( attenuation ) in the water .",
    "these both lead to a decrease in the number of detected photons per pmt which may degrade the pattern of light that the cherenkov cone produces . in the first case ,",
    "since information is not lost and is just spread out to more pmts the problem can likely be handled in improvements to reconstruction codes . in the second case ,",
    "some information about the original cherenkov light emitting particles is unrecoverable .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi0size ] shows the @xmath6 detection efficiency as a function of the opening angle for ranges : 5 m - 10 m , 15 m - 20 m , and 25 m - 30 m and includes information .",
    "it is clearly seen that when the opening angle is smaller ( less than 60@xmath23 ) , the efficiency is improved as the distance to the pmt surface in the @xmath6 direction increases .",
    "note that above the opening angle of 60@xmath23 , the @xmath6 detection efficiency seems more or less independent of . because of the finite size of the detector and at such large opening angles selecting events based on becomes a less capable means of emulating a larger detector .",
    "nevertheless , this indicates that the granularity of the detector in terms of the pmt density is an important factor to improve the @xmath6 detection efficiency .",
    "it also appears that the effect of light attenuation is not a major issue at least for cherenkov light traveling up to 30 - 40 m in sk - i water which has an attenuation length of 80 - 100 m ( depending on wavelength ) .",
    "therefore for the same pmt coverage using the same pmts , a larger detector than sk - i will perform better , on average , to reconstruct @xmath6 .",
    "limitations may be expected once the typical path length for cherenkov light approaches attenuation length .",
    "the @xmath6 detection efficiency as a function of the two photon opening angle for three ranges of the distance from the @xmath6 production vertex to the closest pmt surface in the direction of @xmath6.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a similar study can be done by looking at how the s / b ratio varies as a function of for other event types . in this case",
    "we look at the s / b ratio for values of for the primary e - like ring . for @xmath24",
    "m the s / b ratio changes from the average of 1.4 to 3.8 for events with @xmath25 1.2  , and for events with 2   @xmath26 4 the s / b ratio essentially stays the same .    the large improvement in the s / b ratio for events with @xmath25 1.2 results from an increase in the number of pmts ( pixels ) in a cherenkov ring .",
    "this improvement is significant as in the energy region @xmath25 1.2   the contribution from the nc events is reduced to a level as low as that from the irreducible background .",
    "this improvement , however , is not realized for events with 2   @xmath26 4   presumably because in this energy region multi - pion events are the major background .",
    "this observation is also true if the minimum distance is set at 10 or 15 m , although the improvement in the s / b ratio is less than the case of the 20-m cut . for a sk - i sized detector ,",
    "this 20-m cut reduces the number of the signal events by 41% .",
    "however , if the detector is larger , this loss of efficiency can be greatly reduced .",
    "in other words , for a given detector size , the finer granularity , not necessarily the number of cherenkov photons collected by individual pmt , improves the s / b ratio .",
    "for the baseline of 2,540 ( 1,480 ) km the detection efficiency of the signal events using the sk - i cuts only is found to be 0.361@xmath270.003 ( 0.373@xmath27 0.003 ) and the final efficiency with the further 40% cut on the log - likelihood ratio is found to be 0.145@xmath270.002 ( 0.149@xmath270.002 ) .",
    "the detection efficiency of the background-1 events using the sk - i cuts only is found to be 0.054@xmath270.001 ( 0.059@xmath270.001 ) and the final efficiency with the further 40% cut on the log - likelihood ratio is found to be 0.0025@xmath270.0002 ( 0.0026@xmath270.0003 ) .",
    "the 40% cut on the log - likelihood should be considered as a guidance and the actual cut should be optimized after a detailed study of figure of merit that depends on the experimental design including the neutrino beam properties of a given experiment .",
    "we have demonstrated that a large water cherenkov detector can be used to detect efficiently the signal events by @xmath4s from the neutrino oscillation @xmath20 while keeping the background at a reasonably low level in a vlbno experiment for the baseline of over 1,400 km with a wideband beam .",
