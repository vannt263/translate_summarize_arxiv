    "it is generally expected that a more fundamental theory with a higher symmetry is realized in the early universe .",
    "thus one of the possible environment to test the mechanism of symmetry breaking is found in the early universe where the fundamental symmetry is broken down . in the early stage of universe , especially at gut era , we can neglect the thermal and curvature effects .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place under the influence of the high temperature , strong curvature and non - trivial topology .",
    "much attention has been paid in the study of the spontaneous symmetry breaking under the circumstance of the high temperature , strong curvature and non - trivial topology . for this purpose finite temperature quantum field theory",

    "where the ground state of the system breaks a symmetry of the lagrangian , the symmetry is broken down spontaneously .",
    "if the universe is almost static , homogeneous and isotropic , it is quite natural to assume an order parameter of the symmetry dose not depend on the spacetime coordinates . under this assumption a ground state",
    "is found by observing the minimum of the effective potential as a function of an order parameter @xcite .",
    "hence , the effective potential of many kinds of quantum field theories is evaluated at finite temperature and/or finite curvature with the spacetime structure fixed ( for a review , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a real scalar fields with @xmath5 interaction in static homogeneous and isotropic spacetime .",
    "the @xmath0 theory is one of the simplest models where a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken down . to find the ground state of the system",
    "we evaluate the effective potential at high temperature and strong curavture . in two , three and four spacetime dimensions",
    "the theory is renormalizable . beyond five dimensions the theory is nonrenormalizable . we confine ourselves to the spacetime dimensions greater than or equal to 2 and less than 5 and calculate the renormalized effective potential .",
    "the curvature effect to the symmetry breaking comes from a scale factor dependence of the covariant derivative and a coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational field .",

    "we consider the @xmath6 theory constructed by a real scalar field with a @xmath7 interaction .",

    "the lagrangian is invariant under the discrete transformation , @xmath13 this @xmath14 symmetry prevents the lagrangian from having @xmath15 terms . because of the minus sign of the mass term the symmetric state , @xmath16 , is unstable in a classical level .",
