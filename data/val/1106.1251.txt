    "in the past ten year , there has been a tremendous interest in the casimir interaction between two objects .",
    "this is in part due to the advent in the precise measurement of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough in the methods for effective computations of the casimir force has helped to make possible the exact and numerical computations of the casimir force beyond the precision afforded by the proximity force approximation .",
    "some of the methods developed for computing the casimir interactions include the semi - classical approximation @xcite , the optical path method @xcite , the worldline approach @xcite , the functional determinant or the multiple scattering method @xcite , and the exact mode summation method @xcite .",
    "these methods have been used to compute the casimir interactions of a number of geometric configurations . among the most popularly studied configurations",
    "are the sphere - plane @xcite , the cylinder - plane @xcite , the cylinder - cylinder @xcite and the sphere - sphere @xcite configurations .",
    "it has been shown that all the different approaches give leading order approximations to the casimir force at zero temperature that agree with those obtained using proximity force approximations .",
    "there is an intense interest in computing the corrections to the proximity force approximations .    among the methods mentioned above , the functional determinant or multiple scattering approach and the mode summation approach can give an exact formula for the casimir energy or the casimir force that is valid at all separations between the objects . in general",
    ", it is easy to deduce the asymptotic behavior of the casimir force from the exact formula when the separation between the objects are large .",
    "when the separation is small , this become numerically complicated . therefore , this hampers the comparison between the results obtained numerically using approximation methods and the result computed from the exact formula . in the pioneering work @xcite , bordag has introduced an analytical method to obtain the first order correction to the proximity force approximation for the configuration of a cylinder in front of a plane .",
    "this is later generalized to the configuration of a sphere in front of a plane @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there is a growing interest in the thermal correction to the casimir interaction from both the theoretical and the experimental sides @xcite .",
    "however , the finite temperature casimir interaction between two compact objects have been less studied compared to the zero temperature case .",
    "weber and gies @xcite extended the worldline algorithm to the finite temperature case and showed that there is an interesting interplay between temperature and geometry .",
    "both the sphere - plane and the cylinder - plane configurations were considered . however , as in the zero temperature case , so far the worldline method has only been developed for the case of drichlet boundary conditions . in @xcite , the functional determinant representation of the finite temperature casimir interaction between a sphere and a plane was derived which also took into account dielectric materials .",
    "the casimir interactions at medium and large separations were obtained half analytically and half numerically . in @xcite ,",
    "bordag and pirozhenko studied analytically the finite temperature casimir interaction between a sphere and a plane .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors at small separation is computed to the leading orders and they are found to be coincide with the proximity force approximations at medium and high temperature @xcite .    among the different two - object configurations , the sphere - plane configuration is the most studied since this has been extensively used in casimir experiments @xcite .",
    "however , it has been proposed that the cylinder - plane setup has some of the advantages of both the parallel - plane and the sphere - plane setups @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "klimchitskaya and romero have explored the possibility of obtaining stronger constraints on yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity from measuring the casimir force between a cylinder and a plane .",
    "thus the cylinder - plane configuration is becoming increasingly important in the study of casimir effect .",
    "the exact casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plane at finite temperature has been discussed briefly in @xcite .",
    "the low temperature asymptotic behavior of the thermal correction has been obtained for large separation .",
    "so far no work has considered the exact finite temperature casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plane at small separation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to fill in this gap .    in this paper , we derive the functional determinant representation of the finite temperature casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plane using the matsubara formalism .",
    "the exact expression allows us to conclude that the casimir force is attractive at any temperature for both the dirichlet and the neumann boundary conditions , and hence for the perfect electric conductor condition .",
    "we then derive the small separation asymptotic behaviors of the casimir force in different temperature regions .",
    "the leading order terms are compared to those obtained using proximity force approximation .",
    "the first order corrections are also computed analytically .    in this paper",
    ", we use units with @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we use the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) to find the leading asymptotic behavior of the casimir force between a cylinder and a plate when the separation between them is small .",

    "weber and gies used worldline numerical method to show that the first order correction has the same sign as the leading term .",
    "therefore , the result is more agreeable .",
    "in fact , one would also obtain if one approximate the summation over @xmath129 by an integral , as in the work of bordag @xcite for the zero temperature casimir energy .    for the case of neumann boundary conditions , using",
    ", one finds that @xmath245which is divergent .",
    "if we sum over @xmath207 first , then @xmath246where @xmath247 is the euler constant .",
    "we see that there is a term of order @xmath248 for the first order correction . for the casimir force",
    ", one finds that @xmath249\\right)+\\ldots\\right).\\ ] ]    from the discussion above , we see that there is some ambiguities regarding whether one should sum over @xmath207 first before taking the residue .",
    "the summation over @xmath207 appears because we have expanded the logarithm .",
    "the divergence in @xmath207 is possibly due to the fact that we have expanded each term in the expansion perturbatively , by treating @xmath137 and @xmath250 as small variables .",
    "when we obtain a divergent sum in @xmath207 , we need to question whether the perturbation is legitimate . for the leading order term of the casimir force in the medium temperature region",
    ", we have found that correct result is obtained by summing over @xmath207 first , performing analytic continuation before taking the residue .",
    "however , for the first correction term to the casimir energy in the high temperature region , this seems to lead to a result that does not agree with that obtained using numerical approach .",
    "the latter might also be special because we are facing the divergence series @xmath251 , which is formally @xmath252 , infinity .",
    "in this article , we have studied analytically the exact casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plate at finite temperature for a scalar field with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions . by taking the sum of the dirichlet and neumann casimir interactions , one obtains the casimir interaction for electromagnetic field with perfect conductor conditions .",
    "we rederive the proximity force approximations to the casimir energy and the casimir force in three temperature regions : the low temperature region where @xmath37 , the medium temperature region where @xmath3 and the high temperature region where @xmath6 .",
    "these were compared to the leading terms computed from the exact expression .",
    "it is shown that in the zero temperature , the medium temperature and the high temperature regions , the leading terms derived from the exact expression agree completely with the proximity force approximations .",
    "in fact , for the zero temperature case , the agreement between the proximity force approximation and the exact result has been shown in @xcite . using a similar perturbation developed in @xcite , we apply the inverse mellin transform representation of the exponential function to derive the first analytic corrections to the proximity force approximations . in the zero temperature limit",
