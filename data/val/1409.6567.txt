    "these missions have covered a minor part of the sky ( not more than several % ) but with much better sensitivity and wider energy range compared with rosat . in this paper , we present the interactive maps in 2 - 5 and 5 - 10  kev range . for these maps",

    "for constructing sky map , we first downloaded all publically available ( on july  1 , 2013 ) observation data files for mos  @xcite cameras of _ xmm - newton _  x - ray observatory  @xcite available on the heasarc data archive  @xcite .",
    "these data files were processed using _ extended sources analysis software _ ( esas ) package  @xcite specially developed for analysis of extended sources at the nasa / gsfc _ xmm - newton _  guest observer facility  @xcite in cooperation with the _ xmm - newton _  science operation centre  @xcite and the _ xmm - newton _  background working group  @xcite .",
    "it is publically available as part of _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas ) v.13.5.0 .",

    "esas software relies on filter - wheel - closed data and the data from the unexposed corners of archived observations , rather than `` blank sky '' data ( contaminated by unknown level by different variable background components ) used by a number of other methods .",
    "this is essential for analysis of very faint sky regions ( e.g. galaxy cluster outskirts ) dominated by the background ( rather than the source ) emission .",

    "lists , images , lightcurves and spectra  are produced in fits  @xcite format for user - defined regions within _ xmm - newton _  field - of - view .",

    "we used the standard filters and cuts provided by esas software .",
