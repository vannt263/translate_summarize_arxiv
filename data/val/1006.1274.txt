    "it is known , that kerr geometry displays some properties of spinning particle and diverse classical models of spinning particle were considered on the base of kerr geometry @xcite . since the kerr geometry has a topological twofoldedness of space - time , there appears an alternative : either to remove this twofoldedness or to give it a physical interpretation .",
    "the both approaches have paid attention and were considered in literature , it seems however that the final preference for the solution of this problem is not formed yet .",
    "it is also possible that the both versions of the kerr source can be valid and applicable for different models .",
    "the approach which was the most popular last time is the truncation of the negative sheet of the kerr geometry .",
    "it leads to the appearance of a ( relativistically rotating ) disk - like source of the kerr solution @xcite and to a class of the disk - like @xcite or bag - like @xcite models of the kerr spinning particle .",
    "alternative way is to retain the negative sheet treating it as the sheet of advanced fields . in this case",
    "the source of spinning particle turns out to be the kerr singular ring and its electromagnetic excitations in the form of traveling waves generating spin and mass of the particle .",
    "model of this sort can be considered as a twofold ` alice ' string @xcite and was suggested in 1974 as a model of ` microgeon with spin'@xcite .",
    "recent progress in the obtaining of the nonstationary and radiating kerr solutions @xcite enforced us to return to this model and to consider it as a plausible classical model for the light spinning particles .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the real and complex kerr structures of the kerr geometry and a way for obtaining the exact solutions for microgeon .",
    "we display also the cpt - invariance of kerr geometry and consider the physical interpretation of the negative sheet leading to some unusual properties of the oscillating solutions of this kind .",
    "in this paper we use the kerr - schild approach to the kerr geometry which is based on the kerr - schild form of metrics @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the auxiliary minkowski background .",
    "it allows to give an exact meaning to the complex representation of the kerr geometry and simplifies the treatment of the complex null cones that is necessary to consider the complex retarded - time construction for oscillating solutions .",
    "* the kerr singular ring * is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the kerr solution .",
    "it is a branch line of space on two sheets : `` negative '' and `` positive '' where the fields change their signs and directions .    *",
    "the kerr twisting pnc * is the second remarkable structure of the kerr geometry .",
    "it is described by a vector field @xmath2 which determines the kerr - schild ansatz for metric g _",
    "= _ + 2 h k _ k _ , [ ksa ] where @xmath3 is metric of auxiliary minkowski space - time and h= .",
    "this is a remarkable simple form showing that all the complicatedness of the kerr solution is included in the form of the field @xmath4 which is tangent to the kerr pnc .",
    "this form shows also that metric is singular at @xmath5 , that are the focal points of the oblate spheroidal coordinate system .",
    "field @xmath2 is null with respect to @xmath6 as well as with respect to the metric @xmath7 .",
    "the kerr singular ring and a part of the kerr pnc are shown on the fig.1 .",
    "the kerr pnc consists of the linear generators of the surfaces @xmath8 .",
    "the shown on the fig.1 region @xmath9 corresponds to a `` negative '' sheet of space ( @xmath10 ) where we set the null rays to be `` in''-going .",
    "twisting vortex of the null rays propagates through the singular ring @xmath5 and get `` out '' on the `` positive '' sheet of space ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "indeed , the kerr congruence covers the space - time twice , and this picture shows only the half of pnc corresponding to @xmath12 .",
    "it has to be completed by the part for @xmath13 which is described by another system of the linear generators ( having opposite twist ) .",
    "two pnc directions for the each point @xmath14 correspond to the known twofoldedness of the kerr geometry and to the algebraically degenerated metrics of type d.    as it is explicitly seen from the expression for @xmath15 , the kerr gravitational field has twovaluedness , @xmath16 , and so do also the other fields on the kerr background .",
    "the oblate coordinate system turns out to be very useful since it covers also the space twice , for @xmath17 and @xmath10 with the branch line on the kerr singular ring .",
    "in the case @xmath18 , corresponding to parameters of elementary particles , the horizons of the kerr - newman solution disappear and the kerr singular ring turns out to be naked . the naked kerr singular ring was considered in the model of spinning particle - microgeon @xcite - as a waveguide providing a circular propagation of an electromagnetic or fermionic wave excitation .",
    "twofoldedness of the kerr geometry admits integer and half integer wave excitations with @xmath19 wave periods on the kerr ring of radius @xmath20 .",
    "it is consistent with the corresponding values of the angular momentum @xmath21 and mass @xmath22 in accordance with the main relation for the kerr parameters @xmath23 .",
    "radius of the kerr ring @xmath24 turns out to be of the order of the corresponding compton size .",
    "it was recognized soon @xcite that this construction can be considered as a closed string with a spin excitations .",
    "this proposal was natural since singular lines were used in many physical models of the dual relativistic strings .",
    "the most well known example of this kind is the nielsen - olesen model representing a vortex line in superconductor , another example is the witten superconducting cosmic string @xcite .",
    "the kerr ring displays a few stringy properties .",
    "first , the compton size of kerr ring @xmath20 is a typical size of the relativistic string excitations . because of",
    "that the radius of interaction of the kerr spinning particle is not determined by mass parameter @xmath22 , as it has the place for other gravitational solutions , but it is extended to the compton distances @xmath25 . in the same time the contact stringy character of interaction is provided with a very small effective cross - section . if we assume the existence of a stringy tension @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 , then , in the combination with the kerr relation @xmath28 , one obtains the regge relation @xmath29 . finally , as it was shown in @xcite by the analysis of the axidilatonic generalization of the kerr solution @xcite , the field near the kerr singular ring of this solution is similar to the field around a heterotic string .",
    "note also , that the kerr ring is a relativistic light - like object , that can be seen from the analysis of the kerr null congruence near the ring .",
    "the light - like rays of the kerr congruence are tangent to the ring , as it is shown on the fig.2 . in stringy terms",
    "the kerr string contains only modes of one ( say ` left ' ) direction .",
    "however , the equations for the usual bosonic closed strings do not admit such solutions in four dimensions .",
    "there are a few ways to avoid this obstacle .",
    "one of them is to assume that the model contains the right modes too , but they are moving in the fifth compactified direction . another way is to consider the traveling waves as the missing ` right ' excitations .    in this connection",
    "one should mention one more stringy structure of the kerr geometry , complex euclidean string @xcite , which is related to its complex representation .",
    "complex representation of kerr geometry , has been found useful in diverse problems @xcite . in the kerr - schild approach it allows one to get a retarded - time description of the nonstationary maxwell fields and twisting algebraically special solutions of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "twisting solutions are represented in this approach as the retarded - time fields which are similar to lienard - wiechard fields , however they are generated by a _",
    "complex _ source moving along a _ complex world line _ @xmath30 in complex minkowski space - time @xmath31 .",
    "the objects described by the complex world lines occupy an intermediate position between particle and string . like the string they form the two - dimensional surfaces or the world - sheets in the space - time @xcite . in many respects",
    "this source is similar to the `` mysterious '' @xmath32 complex string of superstring theory @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that analytical complex world lines are the solutions of the corresponding string equations .",
    "below we shall show that a given complex world line can control excitations of the kerr singular ring .",
    "based on the recent progress in the obtaining nonstationary kerr solutions @xcite , we shall try to get selfconsistent solutions for traveling waives accompanied by oscillating singular ring of the kerr geometry .",
    "the light cones emanating from the word line of a source play usually a central role in the retarded - time constructions where the fields are defined by the values of a retarded time . in the case of complex world line ,",
    "the corresponding light cone has to be complex that complicates the retarded - time scheme .",
    "there exist the newton and coulomb analogues of the kerr solution possessing the kerr singular ring .",
    "it allows one understand the origin of this ring as well as the complex origin of the kerr source .",
    "the corresponding coulomb solution was obtained by appel still in 1887 ( ! ) by a method of complex shift @xcite .",
    "a point - like charge @xmath33 , placed on the complex z - axis @xmath34 gives a real appel potential @xmath35 here @xmath36 is in fact the kerr complex radial coordinate @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the oblate spheroidal coordinates .",

    "it was shown , that this ring is a branch line of space - time for two sheets similarly to the properties of the kerr singular ring .",
    "appel potential describes * exactly * the e.m . field of the kerr - newman solution @xcite .    as far the appel source",
    "is shifted to a complex point of space @xmath44 , it can be considered as a mysterious `` particle '' propagating along a _",

    "complex source of the kerr - newman solution has just the same origin @xcite and leads to a complex retarded - time construction for kerr geometry .",
    "the appearance of the twisting kerr congruence may be understood as a track of the null planes of the family of complex light cones emanated from the points of the complex world line @xmath47 @xcite in the retarded - time construction .",
    "it is very instructive to consider the following splitting of the complex light cones .",
    "the complex light cone @xmath48 with the vertex at some point @xmath49 , written in spinor form = \\{x : x = x^_o ( ) + ^a_l ^_a ^_r } [ sclc ] may be split into two families of null planes : `` left '' @xmath50 = const ; @xmath51 -var . ) and `` right''@xmath52 = const ; @xmath53 -var . ) .",
    "these are the only two - dimensional planes which are wholly contained in the complex null cone .",
    "the rays of the principal null congruence of the kerr geometry are the tracks of these complex null planes ( right or left ) on the real slice of minkowski space .    the light cone equation in the kerr - schild metric coincides with the corresponding equation in minkowski space because the null directions @xmath54 are null in both metrics , @xmath7 and @xmath55 .",

    "coordinates @xmath61 and @xmath62 take the real values and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are complex conjugate .",
    "the known splitting of the light cone on the complex null planes has a close connection to spinors and twistors . by introducing the projective spinor parameter @xmath63 the equation of complex light cone with the vertex at point @xmath49 , ( -_0 ) ( -_0 ) = - ( u - u_0 ) ( v - v_0 ) ,",

    "@xmath174 that describes a null electromagnetic radiation @xmath175 propagating along the kerr pnc direction @xmath128 . in accordance with ( [ 14 ] )",
    "it has to lead to a loss of mass by radiation with the stress - energy tensor @xmath176 , similarly to the vaidia `` shining star '' solution @xcite .",
    "however , the kerr twofoldedness shows us that the loss of mass on the positive sheet of metric is really compensated by an opposite process on the negative sheet with an in - flow of the radiation .",
    "the structure of the kerr pnc shows that there are no discharges or sources of this flow .",
    "one can assume that the @xmath177 is really a vacuum zero - point field , or the field of the null vacuum fluctuations , which has a resonance on the kerr singular ring .",
    "the zero - point field has a semi classical nature since it has a quantum origin , but a classical exhibition in the form of the well known casimir effect .",
    "therefore , this radiation can be interpreted as a specific exhibition of the casimir effect .",
    "to improve the situation with the loss of mass by this field one can use the known recipe for computation of the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the classical energy - momentum tensor has to be regularized t_reg^= : t^ :  t^-<0|t^|0 > under the condition @xmath178 . on the classical level of the einstein - maxwell equations",
    ", this procedure corresponds exactly to the subtraction of the term @xmath179 from ( [ 14 ] ) .    since this radiative term @xmath179 will also appear in all other oscillating solutions",
    ", it is tempting to conjecture that on the quantum level this procedure is equivalent to the postulate on the absence of radiation by oscillations .",
    "preliminary treatment of the other oscillating solutions shows one more peculiarity of this system : the appearance of an imaginary contribution to the mass parameter .",
    "such contributions are not admissible in the standard kerr - schild formalism , but the imaginary mass term appears in some other formulations , in particular , in the form of the nut - parameter of the kerr - nut solution . by a nonzero value of this parameter",
    "there appears one more ` axial ' singular filament ( dirac monopole string ) which threads the kerr singular ring and is extended to infinity .",
    "note , that such an ` axial ' string was also observed in the supersymmetric extension of the kerr - newman solution by the treating the fermionic traveling waves @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned in @xcite , this second singular filament , being topologically coupled to the kerr singular ring , acquires an interesting interpretation as a carrier of the de broglie wave . in the space - time with nontrivial boundaries this filament can play the role of a guide in a topological wave - pilot construction .",
    "more detailed analysis of the system of these equations will be given elsewhere .",
    "author thanks organizing committee for very kind invitation and financial support and also v. kassandrov and b.frolov for useful discussions .",
    "following the notations of the work @xcite , the kerr - schild null tetrad @xmath180 is determined by relations : @xmath181 and g_ab= e_a^e_b = (        the ricci rotation coefficients are given by ^a_bc = - e^a _ ; e_b^e_c^. [ ( 1.4 ) ] the pnc have the @xmath128 direction as tangent",
