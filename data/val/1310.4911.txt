    "according to the universality hypothesis  @xcite , all critical systems with the same dimensionality , the same symmetry of the order parameter , and the same range of interactions are expected to share the same set of critical exponents .",
    "for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model ( square and some other lattices ) all critical exponents are known exactly  @xcite .",
    "these exponents are expected to be obeyed by the ising model on all 2d lattices and also by all other models , which according to the hypothesis are expected to belong in the same universality class .",
    "furthermore , there is strong evidence that , in addition to critical exponents , certain critical - point ratios are universal  @xcite and of particular interest is the value of the critical binder cumulant of the order parameter , discussed also in the present work .",
    "the fourth - order cumulant of some thermodynamic parameter @xmath1 of a finite lattice system , known as the binder cumulant , is defined as  @xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 the linear lattice size .",
    "the critical value of the binder cumulant of the order parameter of an ising system is then @xmath4 with @xmath5 the magnetization @xmath6 @xmath7 the spin variable , and @xmath8 the number of lattice sites .",
    "this parameter is a measure of the deviation of the universal probability density function from a gaussian function .",
    "it is well known that the characteristic behavior of @xmath9  @xcite near criticality provides a traditional route to obtain transition temperatures ( from the intersection of the cumulants of systems with different sizes ) and may also be used to extract the critical exponent @xmath10 of the correlation length  @xcite .",
    "its critical value , @xmath11 , was originally believed to fully characterize a given universality class . as discussed by various authors",
    ", the same value seems to be shared by several 2d models , such as the xy models with an easy axis , the nearest - neighbor spin-1 ising model , and the isotropic nearest - neighbor ising - like models , including also the nearest - neighbor `` border @xmath12 model '' with softened spins  @xcite .",
    "it appears also to be independent of the lattice details , such as the lattice structure  @xcite .",
    "however , this `` universality '' applies only in a limited sense .",
    "the value of @xmath11 does depend on the boundary conditions  @xcite , the shape of the system  @xcite , as well as on the symmetry of the interactions  @xcite .    an accurate estimation of critical point ratios for the ferromagnetic ising model on the square and triangular lattices has been provided via the transfer - matrix technique  @xcite . in this paper , kamieniarz and blte estimated @xmath13 as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath0 ( see discussion below for the definition of @xmath0 ) , reporting , in particular for the square ising model with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath14 , the value @xmath15 .",
    "the influence of the anisotropic interactions on the critical binder cumulant was studied , analytically , by dohm and chen  @xcite and , numerically , by selke and shchur  @xcite , indicating that @xmath11 depends continuously on the anisotropy , in the case of periodic boundary conditions and @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , kastening  @xcite obtained a renormalization - group quantitative description of the anisotropy dependence of @xmath11 .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate certain aspects of the critical binder cumulant and , in particular , its dependence on the boundary conditions and the relevant aspect ratio of the lattice .",
    "we concentrate our interest on numerical observations illustrating parallel behavior to that of the critical binder cumulant of the largest fortuin - kasteleyn cluster ( lfkc ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we define the model and outline the numerical details .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec:3 ] , we present and discuss our numerical findings .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "let the size of the lfkc be denoted by @xmath16 and let us define , in analogy to the magnetization , @xmath17 .",
    "then , the relevant critical binder cumulant may be denoted as @xmath18 . to be concrete ,",
    "we consider the square ising model in zero field , with the standard hamiltonian @xmath19 where the spin variables @xmath7 take the ising values @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes summation over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites . for the needs of our study , we construct ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor square ising systems with @xmath3 rows and @xmath22 columns , corresponding to @xmath23 sites .",
    "furthermore , we consider several values of the aspect ratio @xmath24 , and investigate both periodic ( pbc ) and free boundary conditions ( fbc ) . as our numerical vehicle ,",
    "we implement the swendsen - wang algorithm  @xcite , and we identify clusters by the hoshen - kopelman procedure  @xcite .    the comprehensive monte carlo study of de meo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a review of the connections of fortuin and kasteleyn s work  @xcite to the swendsen - wang algorithm and a review of the relevant literature . in this study , the authors investigated the scaling properties of the cluster size distribution and provided a numerical verification of the theoretical results given by hu  @xcite . in particular , they showed that the relevant bond - correlated percolation model has the ising critical temperature and critical exponents .",
    "thus , it is generally assumed , that the lfkc corresponds to the magnetization , but the distribution functions , and accordingly , the binder cumulants , are quite different .",
    "we concentrate on the dependency of the critical binder cumulants , @xmath11 and @xmath18 , on the boundary conditions and the aspect ratio and compare our results with previous work when available  @xcite .",
    "we also illustrate and compare the corresponding probability density functions ( pdfs ) observing their evolution as a function of the aspect ratio . for pbc and @xmath25 , a pronounced double - peak structure",
    "is observed in the pdf of lfkc , and we give for this a geometrical explanation , involving the probability that the lfkc percolates along both ( short and long ) directions of the lattice simultaneously .",
    "finally , we discuss the critical - exponent equivalence  @xcite and the scaling properties of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for both pbc and fbc .",
    "in particular , we estimate the amplitudes @xmath28 of the power law @xmath29 for all values of the aspect ratio considered . it is shown that these amplitudes follow a power law with @xmath0 , and the corresponding exponents are determined .",
    "this analysis is related to the interesting superscaling concepts reported by watanabe _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their study of percolation on rectangular domains , as will be further discussed below .",

    "the numbers in parentheses denote errors . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular , for the case of pbc with @xmath14 , we found by applying a simple power law , @xmath30 from the magnetization data and @xmath31 from the @xmath32 data , with corresponding amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , this was an exceptionally good case , while for fbc with @xmath14 , the simple power law , when applied in the range @xmath35 , produces the results @xmath36 .",
    "moving to larger values of @xmath37 , upon using the range @xmath38 , we found @xmath39 .",
    "thus , even the simple power law improves the estimation by increasing @xmath37 . however , the fitting attempts using the correction term are now most effective , giving in the range @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the sequence of effective estimates resulting from the scheme with the correction term and a fixed exponent to the expected value @xmath42 , converges smoothly to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these results indicate that the amplitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in general different , and in the case of fbc the simplest correction term @xmath47 , is very effective since already the effective estimates of the range @xmath35 are very close to their asymptotic values .",
    "the systematic application of the above described extrapolation schemes verifies that for all aspect ratios @xmath0 the amplitude @xmath48 is higher from @xmath49 , and in fact their difference grows with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this is an interesting topic related to the theoretical arguments of hu  @xcite and to the superscaling concepts reported by watanabe _",
    "_ in their study of percolation on rectangular domains  @xcite .",
    "adapting this superscaling proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite to our study at criticality , we assume that the above amplitudes follow for large @xmath0 a power law .",
    "this is equivalent to the proposal @xmath50 and thus for the relevant amplitudes we associate a superscaling exponent @xmath51 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have pointed out the interest of a study of their superscaling concept to correlated percolation models  @xcite , such as the present model . in order to verify these concepts , in the realm of the present study , we have carried out an accurate estimation of the amplitudes for all @xmath0 considered here .",
    "our estimates are given in table  [ tab:2 ] and the general behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "the amplitudes of the magnetization follow closely , for large enough @xmath0 , say @xmath52 , a simple power law of the form @xmath53 , whereas for fbc @xmath54 of the lfkc , the deviations from the simple power law are larger .",
    "now , a correction term of the form @xmath55 stabilizes the behavior of the effective estimates .",
    "thus , in the case of pbc we find @xmath56 , while @xmath57 for the case of fbc .",
    "the above asymptotic behaviors have been illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] by drawing the corresponding lines through the estimates in the range @xmath58 .",
    "as expected , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , the power laws apply only for systems with large @xmath0 .",
    "to summarize our conclusions , the amplitudes of @xmath59 and @xmath46 are , in general , different and depend on the boundary conditions",
    ". their dependence on the aspect ratio @xmath0 can be meaningfully described by the superscaling concepts of ref .",
    "@xcite , and by estimating the corresponding exponents . these superscaling exponents ( @xmath51 )",
    "are certainly different for @xmath45 and @xmath60 , but are independent of the boundary conditions .",
    "this universality with respect to the boundary conditions appears to be also valid , as we have showed , for the approach of the cumulants to their limiting values for large @xmath0 .",
    "our illustrations of the distribution functions allow for a better understanding of the different behaviors of the binder cumulants and provide an interpretation showing the dominance of the fluctuations of the lfkc and the importance of their shifts for the corresponding order - parameter s universal distribution functions .",
    "larger fluctuations of the lfkc and their shifts to smaller values induce similar behaviors on the statistically significant part of the fortuin - kasteleyn clusters , enhancing the small order - parameter behavior , which is mainly responsible for large deviations of the critical cumulant from the value @xmath61 of the ordered phase .",
    "a straightforward future challenge emerging from the current work would be the test of the above findings for different lattice geometries and higher dimensions .",
    "the main issue of this work was to explain , by looking at the geometrical sensitivity of the lfkc upon varying the boundary conditions and the aspect ratio , the interesting behavior of critical binder cumulants of the order parameter .",
    "as shown , these features are reflected in the distribution functions of the lfkc and it should be underlined at this point that one aspect of the fundamental achievement in the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena , i.e. , the confirmation of universality and the calculation of critical exponents , has been obtained via the pdfs of the main thermodynamic variables of the system at criticality .",
    "the use of the universal character of the order - parameter pdf in describing critical properties of models in statistical mechanics has been shown to be quite valuable  @xcite , has been extended to the study of pure and disordered magnetic systems and is of current interest ( for a recent review and update on the topic see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank professor walter selke for a careful reading of the manuscript and useful comments , as well as niklas fricke for useful correspondence , pointing out that the fluctuations of the order parameter are probably dominated by the size of the largest fortuin - kasteleyn cluster .",
