    "the goal of xenon @xcite is to search for interactions of massive , cold dark matter particles in liquid xenon .",
    "the motivation of this search comes from our current understanding of the universe . over the last ten years",
    ", a variety of cosmological observations , from the primordial abundance of light elements , to the study of large scale structure , to the observations of high redshift supernovae , to the detailed mapping of anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background , have led to the construction of a so - called concordance model of cosmology . in this model",
    ", the universe is made of @xmath04% baryons which constitute the ordinary matter , @xmath023% nonbaryonic dark matter and @xmath073% dark energy @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of dark matter poses a significant challenge to astrophysics .",
    "the solution may involve new particles with masses and cross sections characteristic of the electroweak scale .",
    "such weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) , which would have been in thermal equilibrium with quarks and leptons in the hot early universe and decoupled when they were non - relativistic , represent a generic class of dark matter candidates  @xcite .",
    "if wimps are the dark matter , their density in the milky way halo may allow them to be detected in laboratory experiments by looking for the nuclear recoils produced in elastic wimp  nuclei collisions @xcite . a wimp with a typical mass between 10gev 10tev will deposit a nuclear recoil energy below 100kev in a terrestrial detector .",
    "the expected rates are determined by the wimp - nucleus cross section and by their density and velocity distribution in the vicinity of the solar system @xcite .",
    "direct - detection experiments , in particular cdms  ii  @xcite , cresst  @xcite , edelweiss  @xcite , zeplin  ii  @xcite and warp  @xcite , are beginning to significantly constrain the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section and , for the first time , start to probe the parameter space which is predicted by supersymmetric extensions to the standard model ( recent reviews can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "while it is clear that cryogenic experiments such as cdms are still leading the field , detectors based on liquid noble elements ( ar , xe ) are rapidly evolving and are already catching up in sensitivity .",
    "liquid argon ( lar ) and xenon ( lxe ) have excellent properties as dark matter targets .",
    "they are intrinsic scintillators , with high scintillation ( @xmath1 = 128  nm for ar , @xmath1 = 175  nm for xe ) and ionization yields .",
    "they are available in large quantities ( with lar being much cheaper ) and can be purified to 1ppt ( parts per trillion)-levels .",
    "scintillation in lar and lxe is produced by the formation of excimer states , which are bound states of ion - atom systems .",
    "if a high electric field ( @xmath01 kv / cm ) is applied , ionization electrons can also be detected , either directly or through the secondary process of proportional scintillation .",
    "measuring both the primary scintillation signal and a secondary process yields a method of discriminating between electron and nuclear recoils . in lar , an additional differentiation ,",
    "namely the time difference between the decay of the singlet and triplet excited states ( 6 ns versus 1.6@xmath2s ) is being used .",
    "an advantage of lxe is its high density ( 3g/@xmath3 ) , which provides self - shielding and allows for compact detectors , and the high atomic number ( z=54 , a=131.3 ) , which is favorable for scalar wimp - nucleus interactions .",
    "moreover , since natural xe has two isotopes with spin ( @xmath4xe , @xmath5xe , at the combined level of almost 50% abundance ) , a liquid xenon detector is susceptible for both coherent and axial - vector wimp - nucleus couplings .",
    "xenon10 is a new direct dark matter search experiment with the aim of observing the small energy released after a wimp scatters off a xenon nucleus @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous detection of ionization and scintillation in a liquid xenon ( lxe ) 3d position sensitive time projection chamber ( tpc ) allows to distinguish nuclear recoils ( as produced by wimps and neutrons ) from the dominant electron recoil background ( as originated from photon and electron interactions ) @xcite .",
    "the detector has been transported from the nevis laboratory at columbia university to gran sasso in march 2006 and has been installed in its low - background shield in mid july 2006 .",
    "it has been taking data continuously and very stably since then , with a total of more than 75 live days of wimp search data accumulated .",
    "the dual - phase ( liquid and gas ) tpc is filled with 22 kg of ultra - pure liquid xenon , the active volume being defined by a teflon cylinder with an inner diameter of 20 cm and a height of 15 cm ( the total active mass is 15 kg of lxe ) .",
    "the tpc is equipped with four wire meshes , two in the liquid and two in the gas phase .",
    "the bottom mesh serves as a cathode and the next one , positioned just below the liquid level , forms , together with a series of field shaping rings , the 15 cm drift region .",
    "the two last meshes , along with the one below the liquid level , serve to define the gas proportional scintillation region .",
    "the active xenon volume is viewed by 89 hamamatsu r8520 - 06al 1inch square pmts , 35 mm high .",
    "the bottom array of 41 pmts is located below the cathode , fully immersed in lxe , and mainly detects the prompt light signal ( in the following labeled s1 ) .",
    "the 48 pmts of the top array are located in the cold gas above the liquid , detecting the proportional light signal ( labeled s2 ) which is created by the collision of extracted electrons with xe atoms in the gas phase ( the drift field is 0.7kv / cm ) .",
    "figure [ fig : xenon10 ] shows the xenon10 detector in its low - background shield ( left ) as well as a picture of the top pmt array ( right ) .",
    "the hit pattern in this array is used to reconstruct the x - y position of an event with few mm resolution .",
    "the z - coordinate is calculated from the time difference between the pulses of direct and proportional light ( with a maximum of 75@xmath2s and a resulting z - resolution of @xmath61 mm ) .",
    "typical low energy electron and nuclear recoil events detected by xenon10 pmts are shown in figure [ fig : events ] . as we will demonstrate in the next sections , the 3d position sensitivity and the self shielding of lxe , serves , along with the prompt versus proportional light ratio , as a fundamental background rejection feature .",
    "the cooling of xenon10 is provided by a pulse tube refrigerator directly in contact with the xe gas .",
    "we have attained a very stable pressure ( @xmath7 atm ) and temperature ( @xmath8c ) for over six months of operation . under these conditions",
    "the fluctuation of pmt gains is @xmath9 . to reach the high purity required for a lxe tpc with a drift gap of 15 cm",
    ", we are continuously circulating the xenon gas through a high temperature getter . the electron lifetime inferred from recent data",
    "is @xmath10ms which corresponds to a @xmath11 ( o@xmath12 equivalent ) xenon purity .",

    "such a calibration allows to determine the predicted wimp signal region as well as the detector s ability to distinguish between nuclear and electron recoils down to its energy threshold .",

    "the right side of the same figure shows a histogram of the remaining background after fiducial volume cuts , together with the result of a monte carlo simulation based on the measured activities of the detector and shield materials .",
    "the backgrounds can be explained by the u / th / k / co radioactivity in the pmts , in the stainless steel used in the detector and cryostat , and in the signal and high voltage ceramic feedthroughs .",
    "the sensitivity to wimp - nucleon interactions depends on the detector s ability to distinguish between electron and nuclear recoils , for the dominant background stems from electron recoil interactions .",

    "( 10 - 40kevr ) , zero events are observed in the 50% acceptance window of the nuclear recoil band . in the region above 15keve energy , we observed few events in the nuclear recoil band .",
    "our current understanding is that these are double scatter events , with one interaction in a passive region and one in the fiducial volume . since no s2 signal is observed for scatters in passive xenon , the additional s1 signal from such a region results in a smaller log@xmath22(s2/s1 ) ratio .",
    "we are currently testing this hypothesis with monte carlo simulations and comparison with calibration data , and are planning to block the passive xenon regions for the s1 light signal for an upgraded xenon10 version .",
    "we are in the process of analyzing the complete science data set , whereby we have blinded about two - thirds of the total wimp search data .",
    "we are developing the data quality and physics cuts , and are testing their efficiencies on calibration and non - blinded wimp search data .",
    "we expect that the existing configuration can probe wimp - nucleon cross sections down to 1@xmath2410@xmath25pb for coherent wimp - nuclei interactions .",
    "concomitantly , we are preparing an upgrade of the xenon10 detector .",
    "modest changes , such as the replacement of ceramic feedthroughs with lower activity ones , already in hand , the replacement of the stainless steel vessel with a vessel made of ofhc copper , selection of low radioactivity pmts , etc , would reduce the expected background to 0.1 events / kev / kg / day , one order of magnitude below the current level .",
    "we also expect that operation of the detector at a higher drift field will improve the nuclear versus electron recoil discrimination , and that optically masking the dead xenon regions will decrease the number of potential leakage events .",
    "if lower backgrounds and a higher discrimination can be achieved , xenon10 could reach a wimp - nucleon sensitivity of 2@xmath2410@xmath26pb by 2008 .",
