    "effects of an electron - electron interaction in electronic systems have become a focus of the condensed matter physics recently . in a three or higher dimensions",
    ", it is widely believed that landau s fermi liquid theory is valid and the effect of the interaction is absorbed into several phenomenological landau parameters .",
    "the system is metallic even with the interaction since the ground state is adiabatically connected to the free fermi sea where the excitations are given by an electron - hole _",
    "excitation across the fermi surface . in one dimension , however , the ground state is unstable against a perturbation of the interaction and the ground state is given by the so - called tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid . although the fermi liquid theory is not valid in one dimension , the tl liquid is also metallic and the excitations are gapless .",
    "this tl liquid has been focused recently and there are huge number of studies by several techniques as the bosonization and the conformal field theory . in the paper , we are trying to investigate the breakdown of the tl liquid behavior in a simple fermionic system . in a system with periodic potential ,",
    "that is , on a lattice as a model hamiltonian , the allowed kinetic energy is restricted by a finite band width .",
    "therefore the strong electron - electron interaction may bring an opening of the energy gap in electronic systems which is known as a mott transition .",
    "the opening of the energy gap implies a metal - insulator transition which has become a focus again recently in connection to new materials as metal - oxides , organic materials and the high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "as far as the conductivity of the electronic system is concerned , the mott transition can be understood as a freezing of the charge degree of freedom .",
    "there can be spin related phenomena in a small energy scale , however , the mott transition is a phenomenon of the order of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "noting this fact , we have focused on a charge degree of freedom and chosen a model hamiltonian of spinless fermions on a lattice    @xmath1    where the interaction can be long range .",
    "( we set @xmath2 in the following . ) when the interaction is non - zero only for the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites , it is mapped to the spin @xmath3 antiferromagnetic xxz model by the jordan - wigner transformation . in this case , haldane investigated the model in detail by using the bethe ansatz solution of the xxz model@xcite .",
    "generic ground states of the nn model are the tl liquid without the energy gap except at a half filling where the model has a metal - insulator transition at @xmath4 .",
    "it is identified as an antiferromagnetic ising gap in term of the xxz spin model .    in this paper , we investigate the model , when the interaction is long range , with various filling factors of the fermion numbers . as shown later , it has a rich structure as a _",
    "let us first consider a strong coupling limit @xmath5 of the model when the filling factor @xmath6 is rational where @xmath7 is the number of fermions and @xmath8 is the number of sites .",
    "we use a periodic boundary condition in the following .",
    "let us assume the interaction satisfies the downward convex condition , that is , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) to avoid a formation of charge clustering .",
    "( see later . )",
    "a possible form of the interaction which we use in the paper is @xmath11which reduced to a simple power law decaying interaction @xmath12 when @xmath13 in a sufficiently large system .",
    "the nearest neighbor interaction can be recovered also by taking @xmath14 and @xmath15 . when the interaction is sufficiently large , the ground state of the system for the rational filling @xmath16 with mutually prime integers @xmath17 and @xmath18 was known for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is given by a one dimensional wigner crystal with period @xmath18@xcite .",
    "although the ground state charge ordering ( crystal structure ) is complicated if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are large integers , it is explicitly given@xcite . in fig.[fig : chrg ] , shape of the charge ordering is shown for @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 as an example . as is expected for the formation of the charge ordering , there are some commensurate conditions to stabilize the system .",
    "this commensurability condition brings a fractal structure into the system as shown later .",
    "the chemical potential in the thermodynamic limit is evaluated by a similar consideration applied for the long range ising model@xcite .",
    "it is written as @xmath22 f_{[\\frac k\\rho]-1}^\\infty -   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]-1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]}^\\infty { \\rm \\ if\\ }   [ \\frac k\\rho ] = \\frac k\\rho   \\\\   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]+1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]}^\\infty -   [ \\frac k\\rho ]   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]+1 } ^\\infty { \\rm \\ otherwise }   \\end{array}\\right .",

    "[ fig : chem ] , the chemical potentials are evaluated for two different interactions .",
    "it is a devil s staircase which was first discussed by bak et al . in a context of the long range ising model@xcite .",
    "the discontinuity of the chemical potential , @xmath28 , which is a key quantity to judge whether the system is metallic ( @xmath29 ) or not ( @xmath30 ) is evaluated as @xmath31this is generically non - negative for the potential which satisfies the convex downward condition .",
    "( if this condition is not satisfied , @xmath32 can be negative for some filling factor which causes an instability .",
    "it is identified as a charge clustering . )",
    "it implies that the energy gap opens for any rational fillings if the interaction is strong enough .",
    "further , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) , the energy gap @xmath33 only depends on @xmath18 .",
    "its dependence is given by a power law @xmath34 .",
    "from the consideration in the strong coupling limit , to have a mott insulator phase in the system with filling factor @xmath19 , finite interaction range over @xmath18 sites is crucial .",
    "on the other hand , when the interaction is weak ( @xmath35 ) , the finite band width due to the lattice effect ( periodic potential ) is not so important . in this case",
    ", one can approximate the system as a continuous model with a long range @xmath36 interaction and with the periodic boundary condition@xcite .",
    "when @xmath37 , the continuum model is a sutherland model which has been studied extensively@xcite . if @xmath37 , the weak coupling model can be discussed using an information from the exact solutions . however , the strong coupling case , of course , neither the intermediate coupling case can not be discussed by the exact solutions . the ground state of the sutherland model is a tl liquid without an energy gap independent of the filling where the ground state is given by the jastraw wavefunction .",
    "noting that there is an energy gap in the strong coupling , it suggests that there is a finite value of the interaction where the energy gap opens .",
    "one possibility is that there is alway non - zero energy gap , that is , the critical value where the energy gap opens , @xmath38 .",
    "however , even in the nearest neighbor model where the energy gap can be most stable , there is a gapless tl phase ( xy phase in the xxz model ) .",
    "therefore we can expect that there are always finite regions of the gapless tl liquid phases in any filling factors and inevitably the mott transition . in the following ,",
    "we give numerical results to confirm these consideration and study the critical region .",
    "as we have discussed , the ground state of the spinless fermions with long range interaction has two phases for any rational filling when the interaction strength is varied .",
    "the one is the tl liquid metallic phase and the other is the mott insulator phase . the transition between the two is a typical quantum phase transition at zero temperature . in this section",
    ", these phase transitions are demonstrated numerically .",
    "the main focus of the numerical calculations here is to investigate a critical behavior near the gap opening ( the transition point ) .",
    "our main strategy is to investigate the system from an insulator side .",
    "we use the exact diagonalization technique for systems with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the hilbert space is divided into several sectors with different momentum quantum numbers and diagonalized within them to obtain the lowest few energies . for small systems ,",
    "the full spectra are also obtained .",
    "due to the small system size available , it is not efficient to calculate the chemical potential directly . instead of it ,",
    "we calculate an excitation gap @xmath39 which can be comparable with @xmath32 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp1o2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : disp1o3 ] , lower parts of energy spectra are shown for systems with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively",
    ". when the interaction is sufficiently weak , one observes a behavior of the gapless tl liquid as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp1o2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : disp1o3](a ) . on the other hand , opening of the energy gap near @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath19 )",
    "is clearly shown when the interaction is sufficiently strong ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : disp1o2](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : disp1o3](b ) ) .",
    "as is known from the strong coupling analysis , there is a discrete symmetry breaking ( translational symmetry ) in the strong coupling phase . for the @xmath19 case ,",
    "this is a @xmath46 symmetry breaking .",
    "correspondingly there is almost @xmath18 degenerate ( ground ) states in a finite system .",
    "they have different total momentum @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) respectively . at these momentum sectors ,",
    "the lowest energy state is given by one of the @xmath18 degenerate ground states .",
    "therefore the lowest energy gap , the energy difference between the lowest energy state at the momentum and the true ground state of the finite system ( usually @xmath49 ) , is related to an energy barrier between the degenerate @xmath18 ground states barrier as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap - exp ] ) . the physical energy gap which we concern is the second lowest one as seen in the figures . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : soft1o3 ] , the lowest energy gap at @xmath50 for @xmath41 is plotted as a function of the system size for several values of the interaction strength . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the gap size obeys a exponential law as @xmath52 which is a signature of the ( discrete ) symmetry breaking and @xmath53 is the order of the symmetry breaking potential .",
    "the discrete symmetry breaking is confirmed numerically for @xmath51 in fig .  [",
    "fig : soft1o3 ] . to confirm the discrete symmetry breaking ,",
    "we have also calculated a spectral flow , that is , the energy as a function of the aharonov - bohm flux through the periodical system ( ring)@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] , the spectral flows of three different momentum sectors ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) for the @xmath41 system is shown where the @xmath56 symmetry breaking is expected .",
    "it is clearly shown that the @xmath57 low energy states are entangled with each other .",
    "that is , these three states are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit which is a signature of the discrete symmetry breaking .",
    "next let us investigate the critical region .",
    "for a nearest neighbor model at half filling , the behavior of the gap opening is known from the bethe ansatz solution and is given by @xmath58 which is essentially singular at the critical point@xcite .",
    "we have numerically investigate the behavior of the gap opening for several filing factors in our long range interaction model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] , the excitation gap is plotted as a function of the interaction strength .    in the massless",
    "tl liquid phase and the mott insulator phase with @xmath59 symmetry breaking , @xmath60 converges to the true energy gap in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore we extrapolate @xmath60 , the energy gap between the lowest energy at @xmath49 and @xmath61 to the infinite size limit by fitting them as a polynomial of the @xmath62 .",
    "an example of the fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] for @xmath41 case with several values of the interaction strength .",
    "the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] can be well fitted by the following essentially singular form as a function of the interaction strength @xmath63it implies that the transition is a generalized kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type .",
    "therefore the transition is of infinite order as a quantum phase transition .",
    "this kind of the singular behavior is expected in the conformal field theory for the off - critical behavior near the conformally invariant critical phase . in the @xmath64 invariant case ,",
    "the exponent @xmath65 is evaluated by the renormalization group analysis to be @xmath66@xcite . at the critical point of the model",
    "has an apparent @xmath46 symmetry but may have higher symmetry .",
    "then one of the possible guesses for the exponent is @xmath67 .",
    "numerically it is difficult to determine @xmath68 and @xmath69 with sufficient accuracies due to the singular behavior of the energy gap .",
    "however one may use @xmath70 as a lower bound of the @xmath71 since it is plausible to expect the wigner crystal at the strong coupling melts near @xmath72 .",
    "this estimate agrees rather well with numerical results obtained ( figs .",
    "[ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , we have shown possible ground state phase diagram using the above estimate . in the figure , the interaction strength is plotted in a nonlinear scale .",
    "it shows that there is alway insulator phase for any rational filling .",
