    "during the last decade much attention has been paid to the inertial range of fully developed turbulence , which contains wave numbers larger than those that pump the energy into the system and smaller than those that are related to the dissipation processes @xcite .",
    "grounding for the inertial range turbulence was created in the well known kolmogorov ",
    "obukhov ( ko ) phenomenological theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main problems in the modern theory of fully developed turbulence is to verify the validity of the basic principles of ko theory and their consequences within the framework of a microscopic model .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical studies indicate possible deviations from the celebrated kolmogorov scaling exponents . the scaling behavior of velocity fluctuations with exponents whose values are different from kolmogorov ones is called anomalous and",
    "usually is associated with the intermittency phenomenon . in turbulence",
    "this phenomenon is believed to be related to strong fluctuations of the energy flux which therefore leads to the deviations from the predictions of the aforementioned ko theory .",
    "such deviations , referred to as anomalous or nondimensional scaling , manifest themselves in a singular dependence of the correlation or structure functions on the distances and the integral ( external ) turbulence scale @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding exponents are certain nontrivial and nonlinear functions of the order of the correlation function , the phenomenon referred to as `` multiscaling . ''",
    "even though great progress in the understanding of intermittency and anomalous scaling in turbulence was achieved as a result of intensive studies , their investigation in fully developed turbulence still remains a major theoretical problem .",
    "although the theoretical description of fluid turbulence on the basis of first principles , i.e. , on the stochastic navier - stokes equation @xcite , remains essentially an open problem , considerable progress has been achieved in understanding simplified model systems that share some important properties with the real problem : shell models @xcite , the stochastic burgers equation @xcite , and passive advection by random `` synthetic '' velocity fields @xcite .    a crucial role in these studies",
    "is played by models of the advected passive scalar field @xcite . a simple model of a passive scalar quantity advected by a random gaussian velocity field , white in time and self - similar in space ( the latter property mimics some features of a real turbulent velocity ensemble ) , the so - called kraichnan rapid - change model @xcite , is an example .",
    "the interest in these models is based on two important facts : first , as shown by both natural and numerical experimental investigations , the deviations from the predictions of the classical kolmogorov - obukhov phenomenological theory @xcite are even more strongly displayed for a passively advected scalar field than for the velocity field itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) , and second , the problem of passive advection is much easier to consider from a theoretical point of view . in these studies",
    "the anomalous scaling was established on the basis of a microscopic model @xcite , and corresponding anomalous exponents were calculated within controlled approximations @xcite ( see also the review @xcite and references therein ) .    the greatest stimulation to study the simple models of passive advection not only of scalar fields but also of vector fields ( e.g. , a weak magnetic field ) is related to the fact that even simplified models with given gaussian statistics of a so - called synthetic velocity field describes a lot of features of the anomalous behavior of genuine turbulent transport of some quantities ( such as heat or mass ) observed in experiments ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references cited therein ) .    an effective method for investigation of a self - similar scaling behavior is the renormalization group ( rg ) technique @xcite .",
    "it was widely used in the theory of critical phenomena to explain the origin of the critical scaling and also to calculate corresponding universal quantities ( e.g. , critical dimensions ) .",
    "this method can also be directly used in the theory of turbulence @xcite , as well as in related models like the simpler stochastic problem of a passive scalar advected by a prescribed stochastic flow . in what follows we use the conventional ( `` quantum field theory '' or field theoretic ) rg which is based on the standard renormalization procedure , i.e. , on elimination of the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences .    in refs.@xcite the field theoretic",
    "rg and operator - product expansion ( ope ) were used in the systematic investigation of the rapid - change model .",
    "it was shown that within the field theoretic approach the anomalous scaling is related to the very existence of so - called dangerous composite operators with negative critical dimensions in the ope ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) . in subsequent papers @xcite the anomalous exponents of the model",
    "were calculated within the @xmath1 expansion to order @xmath7 ( three - loop approximation ) . here",
    "@xmath1 is a parameter that describes a given equal - time pair correlation function of the velocity field ( see later section ) .",
    "important advantages of the rg approach are its universality and calculational efficiency : a regular systematic perturbation expansion for the anomalous exponents was constructed , similar to the well - known @xmath8 expansion in the theory of phase transitions .",
    "afterward , various generalized descendants of the kraichnan model , namely , models with inclusion of large and small scale anisotropy @xcite , compressibility @xcite , and finite correlation time of the velocity field @xcite were studied by the field theoretic approach . moreover , advection of a passive vector field by the gaussian self - similar velocity field ( with and without large and small scale anisotropy , pressure , compressibility , and finite correlation time ) has also been investigated and all possible asymptotic scaling regimes and crossovers among them have been classified @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that the anomalous scaling , which is the most important feature of the kraichnan rapid - change model , remains valid for all generalized models .",
    "let us describe briefly the solution of the problem in the framework of the field theoretic approach ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "it can be divided into two main stages . in the first stage",
    "the multiplicative renormalizability of the corresponding field theoretic model is demonstrated and the differential rg equations for its correlation functions are obtained .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the latter on their ultraviolet argument @xmath9 for @xmath10 and any fixed @xmath11 is given by infrared stable fixed points of those equations . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath6 are the inner ( ultraviolet ) and the outer ( infrared ) scales .",
    "the behavior involves some `` scaling functions '' of the infrared argument @xmath11 , whose form is not determined by the rg equations . in the second stage , their behavior at @xmath13 is found from the ope within the framework of the general solution of the rg equations . there ,",
    "the crucial role is played by the critical dimensions of various composite operators , which give rise to an infinite family of independent scaling exponents as mentioned above ( and hence to multiscaling ) .",
    "of course , both these stages ( and thus the phenomenon of multiscaling ) have long been known in the rg theory of critical behavior . the distinguishing feature specific to models of turbulence is the existence of composite operators with the aforementioned _ negative _ critical dimensions .",
    "their contributions to the ope diverge at @xmath14 . in models of critical phenomena ,",
    "nontrivial composite operators always have strictly positive dimensions , so that they only determine corrections [ vanishing for @xmath14 ] to the leading terms [ finite for @xmath14 ] in the scaling functions .    in ref.@xcite the problem of a passive scalar advected by a gaussian self - similar velocity field with finite correlation time @xcite",
    "was studied by the field theoretic rg method . there , a systematic study of the possible scaling regimes and anomalous behavior was presented at one - loop level .",
    "the two - loop corrections to the anomalous exponents were obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the anomalous exponents are nonuniversal as a result of their dependence on a dimensionless parameter , the ratio of the velocity correlation time and the turnover time of the scalar field .    in what follows",
    ", we shall continue with the investigation of this model from the point of view of the influence of helicity ( spatial parity violation ) on the scaling regimes and anomalous exponents within the two - loop approximation .",
    "helicity is defined as the scalar product of velocity and vorticity and its nonzero value expresses mirror symmetry breaking of the turbulent flow .",
    "it plays a significant role in the processes of magnetic field generation in an electrically conductive fluid @xcite-@xcite and represents one of the most important characteristics of large - scale motions as well @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the presence of helicity is observed in various natural ( like large air vortices in the atmosphere ) and technical flows @xcite . despite this fact",
    "the role of the helicity in hydrodynamical turbulence is not completely clarified up to now .",
    "the navier - stokes equations conserve kinetic energy and helicity in the inviscid limit .",
    "the presence of two quadratic invariants leads to the possibility of appearance of double cascade .",
    "this means that cascades of energy and helicity take place in different ranges of wave numbers analogously to the two - dimensional turbulence and/or the helicity cascade appearing concurrently to the energy cascade in the direction of small scales @xcite .",
    "in particular , the helicity cascade is closely connected with the existence of the exact relation between triple and double correlations of velocity known as the 2/15 law analogously to the 4/5 kolmogorov law @xcite .",
    "corresponding to @xcite the aforementioned scenarios of turbulent cascades differ from each other by spectral scaling .",
    "theoretical arguments given by kraichnan @xcite and results of numerical calculations of the navier - stokes equations @xcite support the scenario of concurrent cascades .",
    "the appearance of helicity in turbulent systems leads to the constraint of the nonlinear cascade to small scales .",
    "this phenomenon was first demonstrated by kraichnan @xcite within the modeling problem of statistically equilibrium spectra and later in numerical experiments .",
    "turbulent viscosity and diffusivity , which characterize the influence of small - scale motions on heat and momentum transport , are basic quantities investigated in the theoretic and applied models .",
    "the constraint of the direct energy cascade in helical turbulence has to be accompanied by a decrease of turbulent viscosity .",
    "however , no influence of helicity on turbulent viscosity was found in some works @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is observed for the turbulent diffusivity in helical turbulence .",
    "although the modeling calculations demonstrate intensification of turbulent transfer in the presence of helicity @xcite direct calculation of the diffusivity does not confirm this effect @xcite .",
    "helicity is a pseudoscalar quantity , hence , it can be easily understood that its influence appears only in quadratic and higher terms of perturbation theory or in combination with other pseudoscalar quantities ( e.g. , large - scale helicity ) . really , simultaneous consideration of memory effects and second order approximation indicates the effective influence of helicity on turbulent viscosity @xcite and turbulent diffusivity @xcite already in the limits of small and infinite correlation time .",
    "helicity , as we shall see below , does not affect known results in the one - loop approximation and , therefore , it is necessary to turn to the second order ( two - loop ) approximation to be able to analyze possible consequences .",
    "it is also important to say that in the framework of the classical kraichnan model , i.e. , a model of passive advection by a gaussian velocity field with @xmath16-like correlations in time , it is not possible to study the influence of the helicity because all potentially helical diagrams are identically equal to zero at all orders in the perturbation theory . in this sense",
    ", the investigation of the helicity in the present model can be consider as the first step toward analyzing the helicity in genuine turbulence .",
    "in fact , it is interesting and important to study the helicity effects because many turbulence phenomena are directly influenced by them ( like large air vortices in the atmosphere ) .",
    "for example , in stochastic magnetic hydrodynamics , which studies the turbulence in electrically conducting fluids , it leads to the nontrivial fact of the existence of a so - called turbulent dynamo  the generation of a large - scale magnetic field by the energy of the turbulent motion @xcite .",
    "this is an important effect in astrophysics .",
    "the main result of the paper will be the conclusion that helicity does not change the anomalous exponents of the single - time structure functions within the two - loop approximation although the separate composite operators which define them strongly depend on the helicity parameter .",
    "this result leads to the following interesting but nontrivial question : is this result related only to the two - loop calculations or does it hold for all orders of perturbation theory ?",
    "of course , the answer to this question definitely lies at least within the three - loop approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "as will be shown , the effective diffusivity rather strongly depends on the helicity parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we present the definition of the model and introduce the helicity to the transverse projector of a given pair correlation function of the velocity field . in sec.[sec : field ] we give the field theoretic formulation of the original stochastic problem and discuss the corresponding diagrammatic technique . in sec.[sec : rg ] we analyze the ultraviolet divergences of the model , establish its multiplicative renormalizability , and calculate the renormalization constants in the two - loop approximation . in sec.[sec : scalreg ] we analyze possible scaling regimes of the model , associated with nontrivial and physically acceptable fixed points of the corresponding rg equations .",
    "there are five such regimes , any one of which can be realized in dependence on the values of the parameters of the model .",
    "we discuss the physical meaning of these regimes ( e.g. , some of them correspond to zero , finite , or infinite correlation time of the advecting field ) and their regions of stability in the space of the model parameters . in sec.[sec : effdiff ] the two - loop corrections to the effective diffusivity are calculated . in sec.[sec :",
    "compoper ] the renormalization of needed composite operators is done and their explicit dependence on the helicity parameter is shown . in sec.[sec : conc ] discussion of the results is present .",
    "in what follows , we shall consider the advection of a passive scalar field @xmath17 which is described by the following stochastic equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the coefficient of molecular diffusivity ( hereafter all parameters with a subscript @xmath22 denote bare parameters of the unrenormalized theory ; see below ) , @xmath23 is the laplace operator , @xmath24 is the @xmath25th component of the divergence - free ( owing to the incompressibility ) velocity field @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a gaussian random noise with zero mean and correlation function @xmath28 where the angular brackets @xmath29 hereafter denote the average over the corresponding statistical ensemble .",
    "the noise maintains the steady state of the system but the concrete form of the correlator is not essential .",
    "the only condition that must be satisfied by the function @xmath30 is that it must decrease rapidly for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes an integral scale related to the stirring . in the case",
    "when @xmath33 depends not only on the modulus of the vector @xmath34 but also on its direction , it plays the role of a source of large - scale anisotropy , whereupon the noise can be replaced by a constant gradient of scalar field .",
    "equation ( [ scalar1 ] ) then reads ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the fluctuation part of the total scalar field @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a constant vector that determines the distinguished direction .",
    "the direct formulation with a scalar gradient is even more realistic ; see , e.g. refs.@xcite . in real problems",
    "the velocity field @xmath26 satisfies the stochastic navier - stokes equation . in spite of this fact , in what follows",
    ", we shall suppose that the velocity field is driven by the simple linear stochastic equation @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a linear operation to be specified below and @xmath41 is an external random stirring force with zero mean and the correlator @xmath42 , \\label{corf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the wave number , @xmath44 is the frequency , @xmath45 is the dimensionality of the @xmath46 space ( of course , when one investigates a system with helicity the dimension of the @xmath47 space must be strictly equal to 3 ; nevertheless , in what follows , we shall retain the @xmath45-dimensionality of all results that are not related to helicity so that we can also study the @xmath45 dependence of the nonhelical case of the model ) .",
    "the transition to a helical fluid corresponds to the giving up of conservation of spatial parity , and technically this is expressed by the fact that the correlation function is specified in the form of a mixture of a true tensor and a pseudotensor . in our approach , it is represented by two parts of the transverse projector @xmath48 which consists of the nonhelical standard transverse projector @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which represents the presence of helicity in the flow . here",

    "the requirement of positive definiteness of the correlation function the absolute value of @xmath56 must be in the interval @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "physically , the nonzero helical part ( proportional to @xmath56 ) expresses the existence of nonzero correlations @xmath58 .",
    "we choose the correlator @xmath59 in eq.([corf ] ) to be a @xmath16 function in time , which is equivalent to the condition that @xmath60 is independent of frequency @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , we shall work with @xmath61 and @xmath62 the wave - number representation of @xmath63 . here , the positive amplitude factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 play the roles of the coupling constants of the model , the analogs of the coupling constant @xmath66 in the @xmath67 model of critical behavior @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath64 is a formal small parameter of the ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "the positive exponents @xmath1 and @xmath3 [ @xmath68 are small rg expansion parameters , the analogs of the parameter @xmath69 in the @xmath67 theory .",

    "are not self - similar and depend strongly on the integral scale ; see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "but , on the other hand , the results presented in ref.@xcite show that the gaussian model gives a reasonable description of the passive advection in the appropriate frame , where the mean velocity field vanishes .",
    "one more argument to justify the model ( [ corv ] ) , ( [ corrvelo ] ) is that , in what follows , we shall be interested in the equal - time , galilean - invariant quantities ( structure functions ) , which are not affected by the sweeping , and therefore , as we expect ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) , their absence in the gaussian model ( [ corv ] ) , ( [ corrvelo ] ) is not essential .    at the end of this section ,",
    "let us briefly discuss two important limits of the considered model ( [ corv ] ) , ( [ corrvelo ] ) .",

    "for completeness of our text in this and the next section we shall present and discuss the principal moments of the rg theory of the model defined by eqs.([scalar2 ] ) , ( [ corv ] ) , and ( [ corrvelo ] ) .    we start with the reformulation of the stochastic problem ( [ scalar2])-([corf ] ) , according to the well - known general theorem ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) , into the equivalent field theoretic model of the doubled set of fields @xmath92 with the following action functional : @xmath93 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int dt\\,d^d{\\bf x}\\,\\ , v_i^{\\prime}\\left[-\\partial_t - r \\right ] v_i , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is defined in eq.([corf ] ) , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are auxiliary scalar and vector fields , and summations are implied over the vector indices .",

    "the canonical dimensions of the model ( [ action3 ] ) can not be determined directly because it contains fewer terms than fields and parameters .",

    "its explicit expression is rather large , and as it can be found elsewhere we shall not repeat it here . at first sight",
    "this result is a surprise but it can be understood in the following , rather simple , way .",
    "as we know the structure functions @xmath488 ( which are studied here ) are functions of the value of the distance @xmath489 .",
    "therefore , only those phenomena will have impact on the critical dimensions that can `` change '' the spatial distances . among such phenomena",
    "belong the compressibility and anisotropy . as for helicity",
    ", it breaks the mirror symmetry but it does not disturb spatial distances .",
    "therefore , it can not influence the critical dimensions , i.e. , it can not change the corresponding asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus , if our statement is right then we expect that the situation will be the same in all orders of perturbation expansion , namely , the quantities such as effective diffusivity will depend on helicity , but critical dimensions of the structure functions will not .",
    "but , of course , for now it is only a speculation and the independence of the critical dimensions of helicity is maybe only the effect of two - loop approximation . to solve this problem",
    "at least three - loop calculations are needed .",
    "on the other hand , to study the helicity effect on the two - loop level it is enough to avoid the conditions of isotropy or incompressibility of the system .",
    "thus , the next step is , e.g. , to include the assumption of compressibility of the system and investigate the combined effects of the helicity and compressibility on the scaling properties of the model under consideration .",
    "we assume that a nontrivial result can be obtained .",
    "as was already mentioned detailed analysis of the two - loop contribution to the critical dimensions of the structure functions within the model under our consideration ( without helicity ) was done in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have recalculated their results and found some discrepancy in interpretations of our and their numerical results .",
    "that is , as our calculations show , a hierarchical behavior of the quantity @xmath490/n^3 $ ] as a function of @xmath222 for a concrete value of @xmath45 ( dimension of space ) is destroyed in fig.1(d ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "this figure corresponds to a large enough value of @xmath45 ( namely , @xmath491 ) .",
    "our calculations lead to the same curves as theirs but they correspond to different values of @xmath222 which can be seen by direct comparison of fig.1(d ) in ref.@xcite and fig.[fig13 ] in the present paper .",
    "epsf    the conclusion is as follows : the hierarchical behavior of the quantities @xmath492 is not present for large enough space dimensions @xmath45 ( the same situation also occurs for other large values of @xmath45 as can be shown by direct calculations ) .",
    "all the other results are the same as in ref.@xcite ; thus we shall not repeat them here .",
    "in this paper , the influence of helicity on the stability of asymptotic regimes , on the anomalous scaling , and on the effective diffusivity was studied in the framework of the passive scalar advected by the turbulent flow with finite correlations in time of the velocity field .",
    "such investigation is important and useful for understanding of efficiency of toy models ( like the kraichnan and related model ) to study the real turbulent motions by means of modern theoretical methods including renormalization group approach .",
    "thus , it can be considered as the first step in investigation of the influence of helicity in a real turbulent environment .    in the present paper ,",
    "the rg calculations are performed in the two - loop approximation , which is necessary to include the effects of helicity .",
    "it was shown that the anomalous scaling of the structure functions , which is typical for the kraichnan model and its numerous extensions ( see the introduction ) , is not changed by the inclusion of helicity in the incompressible fluid .",
    "this is given mathematically by the very interesting fact that although separated two - loop feynman diagrams of the corresponding composite operators strongly depend on the helicity parameter @xmath56 , their sum - the critical dimension @xmath493 - is independent of @xmath56 in the asymptotic regime defined by an ir stable fixed point .",
    "this very interesting fact can be explained physically by rather simple arguments in the following way ( as was discussed in the previous section maybe it is only the effect of the two - loop approximation , therefore , to confirm what follows higher - loop calculations are needed ) .",
    "the single - time structure functions @xmath488 of the scalar field depend only on the spatial distance @xmath489 but not on the direction .",
    "thus , we suppose that only this phenomenon will change the critical dimensions of structure functions which modify spatial relations",
    ". it can be , e.g. , the inclusion of compressibility or spatial anisotropy . on the other hand , helicity breaks the mirror symmetry , which is not related to distance . as a result , the critical dimensions of the structure functions are not affected by the helicity of the system .",
    "we suppose that an analogous situation will hold for all quantities that depend only on the spatial distance ( more precisely , that are constructed from quantities taken at different spatial points ) , and in all orders of perturbation theory",
    ". the situation can be different when one includes in the investigation the effects of helicity together with another assumption about the turbulent flow , e.g. , its compressibility .",
    "we suppose that nontrivial results can be obtained in this more general case .",
    "on the other hand , the stability of possible asymptotic regimes , the values of the fixed rg points , and the turbulent diffusivity strongly depend on the amount of helicity .",
    "it is shown that the presence of helicity in the system leads to restrictions on the possible values of the parameters of the model .",
    "the most interesting fact is the existence of a critical value @xmath494 of the helicity parameter @xmath56 which divides the interval of possible absolute values of @xmath56 into two parts with completely different behavior .",
    "it is related to the existence of a competition between nonhelical and helical contributions within the two - loop approximation . as a result of this competition , within the so - called frozen limit",
    ", the presence of helicity enlarges the region of parameter space with a stable scaling regime , and if @xmath495 the corresponding two - loop restriction vanishes completely and one comes to the one - loop results @xcite .",
    "similar splitting , although more complicated , into two nontrivial behaviors of the fixed point was also obtained in the general case with finite correlations in time of the velocity field .    another quantity which rather strongly depends on the helicity parameter @xmath56 is the effective diffusivity .",
    "it is shown that the value of effective diffusivity can be 50% larger in the helical case in comparison with the nonhelical case .",
