    "the study of extreme events is a fundamental chapter in statistics and a pillar in its applications to natural phenomena . in recent years",
    ", this theory has been approached from a dynamical perspective @xcite . rather than arising from a stochastic process ,",
    "extreme events occur along the _ deterministic _ evolution of a system : see the review @xcite and references therein .",
    "this is not surprising , for chaotic properties of dynamical systems render them equivalent to stochastic processes , in a precise technical sense @xcite .",
    "this intuition guided the founders of modern non  linear dynamics like joseph ford , to whose memory we dedicate this paper , and is still extremely fruitful .",
    "in this theory , one has been able to recover the three basic attraction laws of the statistical theory and to reproduce a wealth of its characteristics .",
    "this is highly desirable , since it is clear that natural phenomena follow deterministic , albeit chaotic , evolution laws . in this endeavor , the `` conventional '' approach ",
    "let us call it so , for clarity  has been to focus on the events which occur when the system s evolution approaches a _",
    "single _ point , or at most a finite collection of points , in a low dimensional phase space @xcite : the closer the approach , the more extreme the associated phenomenon . as a consequence , the function that gauges the strength of extreme events ( we shall call this function the _ intensity _ in what follows ) whether a distance , or a `` physical '' function @xcite , is rather simple .    in this paper",
    "we want to pursue a different approach : we try to construct abstract models that , albeit amenable of analysis , reproduce the expected complexity of a _ physical landscape _ of the intensity function .",
    "consider in fact a realistic dynamical system modeling the evolution of a natural phenomenon .",
    "typically , its motions evolve in a many dimensional phase space , in which the intensity of a physical phenomenon is a non  convex function with many local maxima , almost degenerate , or even singularities .",
    "we may think of projecting this evolution on a manifold of reduced dimension via any of the well known techniques : surfaces of section , embedding , _",
    "et cetera_. clearly , the graph of the intensity function so projected becomes a very complicated object , possibly displaying a fractal structure .",
    "alternatively , consider the minimization of a non convex , multi  variable function  a hard classical problem of computational mathematics . in @xcite",
    "an algorithm has been proposed , by which a chaotic motion explores phase  space , being attracted by minima when they appear in its neighborhood .",
    "this technique has been applied to inverse fractal problems @xcite and to model tuning for oil well production data @xcite .",
    "motions where close encounters with a scattered set of points have explosive significance may also evolve in real spaces : think of a robot `` sniffing '' the air in search of odor sources while cruising around @xcite .",
    "these sources can be mines in a field .",
    "probability of sensing a mine decays exponentially with distance ; mine distribution can not be assumed uniform and certainly / unfortunately more than one mine is to be expected .",
    "a further example is obtained by substituting the robot with a human and mines with infected individuals : spread of infections can be modeled this way @xcite , so that extreme values of a distance function become directly related to the probability of contagion .",
    "the above are just a few examples that motivate the investigation presented in this paper : we shall study dynamical extrema in low dimensional systems , when the intensity function has a complex , hierarchical structure .",
    "in so doing , while being closer to physics , we also introduce a new framework for mathematical investigation that reveals the _ dynamical _ rle of objects of deep significance , like minkowski dimension and content .    in summary",
    ", our work extends the conventional theory in some respects : first , as mentioned , rather than defining the intensity as the distance from a finite sets of points , we let it be a rather complicated function  that we also derive from the distance from uncountable cantor sets .",
    "second , we consider the interplay of such sets and functions with motions with singular continuous invariant measure .",
    "this leads us to define generalized minkowski dimensions and contents . finally , we find that , under certain circumstances , limit laws hold also for merely ergodic dynamical systems with no decay of correlations .    previous related investigations with significant links to our results must be quoted , while underlying differences . in @xcite ,",
    "extreme value statistics for intensity functions taking their maximum value at a specific point of a fractal attractor have been studied .",
    "it has been shown that these statistics are linked to local dimensions of invariant measure on the attractor and can be used to reveal these quantities .",
    "singular continuous invariant measures have been considered in @xcite .",
    "these works , as well as other previous investigations we are aware of , are concerned with _ local _ quantities . to the contrary , we pursue here a _",
    "global _ approach .",
    "this difference emerges clearly when considering the relation between extreme value laws and hitting / return times statistics @xcite : conventional local quantities are replaced in our theory by global hitting / return times statistics , like those studied in @xcite . finally , still in the local framework ,",
    "extreme value laws have been shown to hold also in non  mixing systems , via the peak over threshold approach @xcite , while in this paper they are observed within the block maxima technique .",
    "the approach adopted in this paper can be properly defined as experimental mathematics : while the definitions of the objects under examination , as well as the form of the conjectured limit laws , are complete and rigorous and , frequently , the value of various constants involved are obtained from explicit formal computations , we do _ not _ provide proofs of the conjectured results .",
    "we only put forward a heuristic argument in section [ sec - toy ] , which might perhaps lead to rigorous analysis .",
    "in fact , to the best of our knowledge , the examples presented herein belong to classes not studied so far that might require the development of new techniques .",
    "we therefore bring our contribution by exposing this new framework and by providing numerical evidence .",
    "let us now outline the organization of this paper .",
    "in the next section we sketch the conventional steps of dynamical extreme value theory , mainly to fix notations , and we describe the set - up of our numerical experiments .    in the third section we introduce a simple geometrical model of intensity function with a hierarchical structure : the cantor ladder  not to be confused with the more common cantor staircase .",
    "readers who want to skip this specific example may go directly to section [ sec - discantor ] .",
    "we show that extreme value laws hold for this function , both for a chaotic dynamics and for a non - chaotic , just ergodic , dynamical system , with no decay of correlations .",
    "even if the form of the extreme distributions can be found _ exactly _ , it can not so far be proven _ rigorously _ , but only justified by numerical experiments .",
    "it therefore constitutes an interesting example for further investigation .",
    "the same remark also applies to the cases that follow .    in section [ sec - discantor ]",
    ", we show that the previous example can be related to a generalization of the conventional setting described above , in which the intensity of a phenomenon is a function of the distance from prescribed points in phase space .",
    "in fact , we let these points populate a compact set @xmath0 , the ternary cantor set , and we show that the results obtained in the toy model of section [ sec - toy ] still hold .",
    "a particular case is then put in evidence : when the invariant measure of the dynamical system is the lebesgue measure in @xmath1 and the intensity function is the logarithm of the inverse distance to @xmath0 , extreme value statistics crucially depends on two quantities of fractal analysis : the minkowski dimension and the minkowski content of the set @xmath0 .",
    "this is a remarkable situation in which these quantities take on a dynamical meaning .    in section [ sec - genmink ]",
    "we introduce a further element : in the same setting of section [ sec - discantor ] , we consider dynamical systems with a generic invariant measure @xmath2 . in the conventional case ,",
    "such measures have been studied in @xcite , but still in relation to single ",
    "point distance functions . in the proposed new framework ,",
    "extreme value laws depend on _ generalized _ minkowski dimension and content of the set @xmath0 , _ defined with respect to _ the measure @xmath2 .",
    "although quite natural , we have not been able so far to locate in the literature previous mention of these generalized quantities . when they exist , the results of the previous section are reproduced in this generalization .    to the contrary , in section [ sec - extrare ]",
    ", we study a family of sets @xmath0 , a dynamical map of mbius type and an invariant measure ( also due to minkowski , the remarkable minkowski question  mark function ) such that the conventional scaling law ( which yields non  trivial dimension and content ) does not hold .",
    "a different law is derived and new minkowski constants are introduced , that reflect the non  analytic behavior of the minkowski question  mark function at rational values .",
    "physically , we interpret this law as describing _ extremely rare _ events . again , the new extreme value laws can be exactly computed and tested numerically with success .",
    "a particularly interesting instance of this non  analytic behavior is studied in section [ sec - usuenne ] : this is the case of a set @xmath0 whose hausdorff and minkowski dimension differ .",
    "we derive the form of the scaling law of extreme events and we test it numerically . finally , the conclusion recap the highlights of this work in three paragraphs .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the dynamical approach to extreme value theory , following the comprehensive review @xcite , and we describe the set  up of our numerical experiments .",
    "consider a canonical dynamical system @xmath3 , comprising a transformation @xmath4 on a measure space @xmath5 , which preserves a probability measure @xmath2 which is also ergodic .",
    "also defined on @xmath5 is a physical observable @xmath6 , that represents the _ intensity _ of the phenomenon under examination .",
    "dynamics @xmath7 and observable @xmath8 permits to construct a stationary process @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 for each @xmath11 .",
    "we let @xmath12 be the cumulative distribution function of the process : @xmath13 and we also let @xmath14 .",
    "consider now the evolution starting from @xmath15 , over a finite time span of length @xmath16 , and the maximum value reached by the intensity @xmath8 during this time interval .",
    "this defines the block maximum @xmath17 : @xmath18 an _ extreme value law _ for @xmath19 exists if there is a non - degenerate distribution function @xmath20 $ ] , so that , for every @xmath21 , there exists a sequence of levels @xmath22 , @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 and for which the following holds : @xmath25    the meaning of these definitions is appreciated in the case when @xmath26 are independent , equally distributed random variables with a probability measure @xmath27 .",
    "clearly , @xmath28 so that @xmath29 when @xmath30 tends to the supremum of the support of the distribution of @xmath8 values .",
    "one then chooses a sequence of values @xmath31 such that @xmath32 typically , @xmath33 is parameterized by a real variable @xmath34 , @xmath35 , so that also @xmath31 depends on @xmath34 .",
    "then , in the limit of @xmath16 tending to infinity one has @xmath36 when passing from independent random variables to dynamics , a similar law may still apply , with the introduction of an _ extremal index _",
    "@xmath37 @xcite , so that @xmath38 the extremal index @xmath37 is brought about by dynamical correlations : in fact , at variance with the independent variables case , deterministic evolution may spend sizable time",
    " spans in neighborhoods of points characterized by high values of the intensity function @xmath8 , yielding a clustering of extrema .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated in @xcite and in successive works by the same authors .",
    "finally , in the conventional theory it is required that an affine scaling of the function of the extrema @xmath19 be performed , with sequences of parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , so that the extreme value law takes the form @xmath41 \\leq y \\ } ) \\rightarrow e^{-\\tau_j(y)}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is one of three standard forms @xcite . to the contrary , in the following we will derive limiting laws that can not be put in this form .    to verify the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq-3bis ] ) and to infer dynamical parameters from observations two fundamental approaches have been proposed : block maxima and peaks over threshold . in the latter , the statistics of events whose intensity surpasses a certain value is investigated .",
    "this technique seems better suited for practical applications to experimental time series : see @xcite and references therein . to the contrary , in this paper we follow the former approach , that is , we compute experimentally the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq-3bis ] ) , by birkhoff sums of numerically generated trajectories .",
    "we compare it with the expected limit laws without estimating or fitting parameters , but using the theoretical values obtained otherwise .",
    "the relation between the length of the birkhoff sums ( _ i.e. _ the total time of the evolution ) and the length @xmath16 of the time windows upon which block maxima are computed has been investigated in @xcite : we put ourselves in a situation so to have a sufficient number of samples @xmath43 , to estimate reliably the phase space average . when needed , to achieve this goal we perform numerical calculations on a cluster of processors .",
    "while this brute  force approach is simple to the border of trivial , a comment must be made on the results of sections [ sec - genmink ]  [ sec - usuenne ] , where a singular continuous , invariant measure is investigated . in this case , direct evaluation of the dynamics @xmath7 is numerically ill - conditioned and we employ the technique described in @xcite , @xcite , based on iterated function systems .",
    "we now define a dynamical model that exhibits extreme value features as observed in natural phenomena in a more suggestive way than what obtained by the `` conventional '' approach .",
    "consider @xmath44 $ ] and the cantor ladder function depicted in figure [ disegno ] , which can be compared to the more common cantor staircase function .",
    "this function takes constant values on every gap of the well known ternary cantor set , of increasing magnitude as the size of the gap gets smaller .",
    "this generates a prototype _ fractal landscape _ that models the situation described in the introduction .    to define formally this function one can use the technique of iterated function systems @xcite but in the present case we find it easier to proceed directly : write any number @xmath45 $ ] via its base  three representation @xmath46 and let @xmath47 , for @xmath48 , be the subset of @xmath49 $ ] composed of all points such that the first one in their representation is found at the @xmath50-th position : @xmath51 for instance , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . clearly , these sets are the gaps of integer order @xmath50 in the usual construction of the cantor set , obtained by deleting middle thirds .",
    "equivalently , the set @xmath47 is the set of middle ",
    "third intervals discarded at level @xmath50 in the ternary cantor set construction . therefore , @xmath47 is a collection of open intervals , of length @xmath54 and cardinality @xmath55 . for @xmath45",
    "$ ] the discrete function @xmath56 @xmath57 keeps track of the set @xmath47 to which it belongs .",
    "clearly , for lebesgue almost all @xmath15 the order @xmath58 is finite , we set it to infinity in the residual set .",
    "we stipulate that the physical function @xmath8 depends only on @xmath59 : @xmath60 and it is therefore a piece - wise constant function , whose value is constant on every set @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ disegno ] ) . the monotonically increasing function @xmath61 of the integer argument @xmath50 will be specified shortly .",
    "whatever this choice , the function @xmath8 is discrete and is characterized by a countable infinity of _ plateaus _ on the gaps of a cantor set . on the cantor set itself , we take @xmath8 and @xmath62 to be infinity .    it is now time to specify the dynamics .",
    "we examine two different maps , both of which leave the lebesgue measure @xmath63 invariant .",
    "the first is the hyperbolic dynamics generated by the asymmetric tent map : @xmath64 , for @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for @xmath67 , with the parameter @xmath68 in @xmath69 .",
    "the second is the irrational rotation @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "as it is well known , this dynamics does not exhibit any decay of correlations .    on this basis , let us carry on the analysis sketched in section [ sec - extr ] . letting @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we easily find that @xmath74 the value @xmath75 is the self ",
    "similarity ratio of the ternary cantor set .",
    "notice that the function @xmath76 is discontinuous and we are in the same situation discussed in @xcite : we adopt here the subsequence approach , to consider a discrete set of values @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( see below ) . also notice that @xmath50 is a label of the different level sets of @xmath8 and therefore of the intensity @xmath79 associated to the phase - space point @xmath80 . before making explicit reference to the function @xmath61 ,",
    "let us derive the underlying extreme value law associated with this dynamical process , assuming heuristically independence of the dynamical variables , which can be justified under the strong mixing properties of the dynamical system @xmath81 .",
    "we now write eq .",

    "then , we expect an extreme value law given by eq .",
    "( [ eq-3bis ] ) , with @xmath90 replaced by @xmath91 .",
    "the threshold values @xmath91 depend on the specific choice of the function @xmath61 .",
    "yet , the existence of an extreme value law depends on the discrete nature of this process and can be verified prior to such choice .",
    "in fact , let @xmath92 and @xmath93 , that is , we consider the extreme value of the integer function @xmath56 along a trajectory .",
    "then , it is clear that @xmath94 and eq .",
    "( [ eq-3bis ] ) , with @xmath95 , is equivalent to @xmath96    this dependence can be verified by plotting @xmath97 versus @xmath16 and the combined variable @xmath98 : in figure [ fig1c.ps ] we observe convergence to the extreme value law , as @xmath16 grows . observe that _ three _ sets of data are reported in the figure and appear as almost undistinguishable  see the successive figure [ fig3b.ps ] to appreciate differences .",
    "the first is the function @xmath99 ( that appears as a pure negative exponential , with the choice of axes of the figure ) ; the second is the plot of the numerical data @xmath97 for the dynamical system @xmath81 described above ; the third is analogous to the second , but under the dynamics @xmath100 .",
    "it is remarkable that also in this merely ergodic case the extreme value law is obtained in the limit .",
    "also observe that the extremal index takes the value one , in both cases .",
    "_ in lieu _ of a formal justification of these observations , which we defer to future works , we conjecture that the rle of fast decay of correlations in assuring the dependence conditions @xcite is played here by the complexity of the intensity function , a fact that could also explain the absence of clustering of extreme events .",
    "these results are better appreciated in figure [ fig3b.ps ] , where we plot the difference @xmath101 for the case of the map @xmath100 , which is larger than that observed for the case @xmath81 .",
    "as @xmath16 grows @xmath102 tends to zero for all values of @xmath50 . in this paper , we are not concerned with the rate of convergence to the limit distribution that could nonetheless be derived from these data . in the conventional framework ,",
    "convergence rates have been studied in @xcite .    finally , in figure [ fig4c.ps ] we also plot side by side the empirical densities @xmath103 for the tent map @xmath81 and the irrational rotation @xmath100 .",
    "the differences between the two fade away as @xmath16 grows and as they both tend to the limit extreme value law .",
    "we can put the above results in the usual casting of extreme laws by letting @xmath104 and thus re - writing eq .",

    "we can now return to the problem of specifying the physical function @xmath79 . as typical in dynamical extreme value theory",
    ", we can choose different forms of the function @xmath61 .",
    "let us follow the standard classification given _",
    "e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs .",
    "( 3.3 ) - ( 3.5 ) ; for reasons that will become clear in the following section , functions @xmath107 corresponding to the examples @xmath108 given in @xcite can be obtained by writing @xmath109 and making the substitution @xmath110 .",
    "this yields @xmath111    case 1 has been just studied : in the other cases it is clear that the validity of the extreme value law for the underlying discrete process @xmath112 entails that of the derived processes @xmath26 . by straightforward calculation , since @xmath113 in eq .",

    "let us now take a moment to comment on the second case . observe that this construction accounts for the gutenberg  richter law , according to which the statistical frequency of events more intense than a threshold @xmath34 is a power law in @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , by choosing @xmath120 we obtain @xmath121 , which implies that @xmath122 ergodicity of the dynamical systems with maps @xmath81 and @xmath100 and lebesgue measure clearly implies that the phase - space average above is equal to a time average .",
    "the exponent @xmath123 is experimentally measured in a wide set of natural phenomena ( earthquakes , avalanches , floods , _ et cetera _ ) .",
    "we can so conclude that the simple model based on the cantor ladder well describes events with gutenberg ",
    "richter statistics and yields a frechet law for extrema parameterized by the gutenberg ",
    "richter exponent .",
    "relation between the two laws is well known in the natural sciences : for an example in geophysics , see @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have described a simple dynamical model for extreme values that differs from standard usage in the literature in a significant respect : the intensity function @xmath8 is _ not _ related to the distance of the motion @xmath124 from a point @xmath125 ( or to the measure of a ball centered at @xmath125 ) , but it is a global function with a hierarchical structure . in this section we show that such model can be seen as an extension of the standard approach .",
    "we first show the analogy and we then develop the new theory .",

    "since the cantor sets that we are considering are of null lebesgue measure , almost all points @xmath128 of a typical trajectory belong to a gap .",
    "then , the closest point of the cantor set @xmath0 to @xmath128 is one of the two gap extrema .",
    "define now the distance of a point @xmath15 to a cantor set @xmath0 as @xmath129 where compactness of @xmath0 permits to substitute the required @xmath130 with a minimum .",
    "the previous consideration permits us to compute the average value , with respect to the lebesgue invariant measure , of the _ logarithm _ of the distance @xmath131 when @xmath80 belongs to a gap @xmath132 of length / lebesgue measure @xmath133 : @xmath134 where @xmath135 . in our simple construction ,",
    "when @xmath136 , the diameter of the gap is @xmath137 and this proves that @xmath58 is proportional to the logarithm of the average distance of a point in a gap , from the cantor set @xmath0 .",
    "let us introduce the following generalization of the standard setting : rather than defining @xmath79 via the distance of @xmath128 from a finite set of points , replace the latter by a generic compact set @xmath0 .",
    "the fundamental definition now becomes @xmath138 in which @xmath139 is any of the three forms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - trecas1a])([eq - trecas1c ] ) . in force of this analogy ,",

    "it may , or it may not , coincide with the hausdorff dimension : it does , for the ternary cantor set ; we will see an instance of the opposite case in section [ sec - usuenne ] .",
