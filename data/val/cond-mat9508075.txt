    "liquid helium ( @xmath0he ) has a reputation for being the first substance in which one is able to observe many macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "in particular , it was the first system that could sustain superfluid flow , @xcite and as a consequence display a number of amazing properties such as second sound , quantized vortices and the fountain effect . furthermore , thin superfluid helium films were the first two - dimensional systems experimentally proven to undergo a kosterlitz - thouless transition to the normal state .",
    "@xcite more recently it may have been observed @xcite that on weakly - binding substrates these films are the first - known spatially ordered superfluids .",
    "more precisely , measurements of the third - sound resonance frequency ( which is proportional to the square root of the superfluid density ) of submonolayer helium films on hydrogen and deuterium substrates apparently indicate two independent kosterlitz - thouless transitions : the usual superfluid to normal transition at a temperature @xmath1 that obeys the expected universal jump relation , @xcite and a second new transition at a temperature @xmath2 which is roughly @xmath3 for all coverages .",
    "the second transition appears as a sharp ( but not discontinuous ) rise or dip in the superfluid density depending on the substrate .    in an attempt to explain these experimental results we have recently proposed that below the second critical temperature the superfluid helium film is in a spatially ordered phase exhibiting both off - diagonal ( superfluid ) and diagonal ( hexatic ) long - range order in the one - particle density matrix .",
    "@xcite the main idea behind this proposal is that the hexatic to fluid transition is known to be a kosterlitz - thouless transition driven by disclination unbinding .",
    "@xcite ( disclinations are defects in the orientational order of a crystal created by the insertion or removal of a wedge of atoms , as shown in fig .  1 . ) therefore , our physical picture of the experiments is that at sufficiently low temperatures the film is in a superhexatic phase with only a dilute gas of bound vortices and bound disclinations present due to thermal fluctuations . for entropic reasons",
    "the disclinations then unbind at @xmath2 , leading to a transition from a superhexatic to a superfluid phase since the vortices remain bound at this transition and the presence of free disclinations destroys the hexatic long - range order . at @xmath1 the vortices then also unbind and the film is finally forced into the normal liquid phase .    of course , to make sure that the above picture is qualitatively correct we must also consider the interaction between vortices and disclinations .",
    "this is even more pressing if one realizes that in a supersolid phase ( where all disclination pairs are themselves bound into pairs or triples ) this interaction is of long range and depends logarithmically on the distance between the two kinds of defects .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that this is no longer true in the superhexatic phase due to the screening of the interaction by the surrounding gas of disclination pairs .",
    "a renormalization - group analysis actually shows that the vortex - disclination interaction is irrelevant and that the two separate kosterlitz - thouless transitions indeed survive .",
    "nevertheless , the superfluid density is influenced in a non - universal way by the unbinding of the disclinations and monte - carlo simulations even show that on the basis of our hypothesis a rough qualitative agreement with the experiments of chen and mochel can be obtained .",
    "@xcite    however , to definitely identify the phase below @xmath2 more detailed information is needed . as a first step towards this goal we here present the two - dimensional hydrodynamic equations of a superhexatic by describing the superhexatic as a supersolid with free dislocations ( i.e.  disclination pairs @xcite ) . as a result of this approach",
    "we will also be able to consider the hydrodynamics of the supersolid phase , for which there is at present a renewed interest both in the context of josephson - junction arrays @xcite and solid @xmath0he .",
    "@xcite moreover , spatially ordered superfluid states have recently been proposed to be also relevant for the fractional quantum hall effect , @xcite since this effect can be understood as a condensation of composite bosons .",
    "@xcite we therefore believe that the methods developed below might , if extended to bosons interacting with a chern - simons gauge field , also be used to obtain a description of the dynamics of such exotic quantum hall states .",
    "we have organized the paper in the following manner . in sec .",
    "[ pd ] we first consider the normal solid and hexatic phases by formulating a gauge theory that describes the phonons , the dislocations and the interaction between them . from this theory",
    "we then deduce in sec .",

    "[ sp ] we incorporate the effects of the additional superfluid order parameter @xcite into the hydrodynamic equations derived in sec .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ dc ] with a discussion on the possible relevance of our work to future experiments on submonolayer helium films and with a physical interpretation of our results .",
    "in this section we will derive the long - wavelength ( quantum ) dynamics of the solid and hexatic phases .",
    "the discussion closely follows work by kleinert , @xcite save that we will not include higher gradient elasticity .",
    "this leads to a considerable simplification of the theory but implies that we can not properly treat the dynamics of the disclinations .",
    "fortunately , for our purposes only the dynamics of the dislocations is of importance and this simplification is justified .      in the case of an isotropic crystal ,",

    "this line may be time dependent , and its definition is not unique .",

    "the second term is a leggett friction term and the last term corresponds to the usual frank energy , which is responsible for the fact that the hexatic to liquid transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "having arrived at the hydrodynamic equations for the solid and hexatic phases , our next objective is to incorporate the effects of the additional hydrodynamic degree of freedom associated with the phase of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "fortunately , from the microscopic theories developed for superfluid liquids @xcite and gases @xcite it is well known how we should proceed to obtain the hydrodynamic ( two - fluid ) equations for the superfluid phases starting from the equations for the normal phase .",
    "the procedure consists in principle of four steps .",
    "first , the total ( average ) density @xmath9 of the system is split up into a normal density @xmath222 and a superfluid density @xmath223 . in general these densities",
    "are tensors of second rank , but for systems with hexagonal symmetry which are of interest here they are proportional to the identity @xmath224 and can be considered as scalars .",
    "second , the total momentum density @xmath225 is similarly split up into a normal component @xmath226 and a superfluid component @xmath227 with a superfluid velocity that is purely longitudinal ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "third , for an effectively isotropic system the dissipative terms in the momentum equation must be generalized to @xmath229 finally , we must add the dynamics of the superfluid velocity , which is basically determined from the josephson relation and reads @xmath230 where @xmath231 is again the isothermal bulk modulus and @xmath7 is the chemical potential per unit mass .",
    "we again leave out temperature fluctuations since we are primarily interested in third - sound modes , for which these fluctuations are ( at least qualitatively ) unimportant .      to apply the above procedure to eq .",
    "( [ hs ] ) we must realize that we are here in fact already dealing with a two - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "we must therefore not only split up the total momentum density @xmath225 into a normal and a superfluid component but also the net defect current , i.e.@xmath232 .",
    "moreover , we have to account for the fact that the chemical potential , just like the pressure , is a function of the particle density and the net defect density . in this manner",
    "we arrive at the following hydrodynamic equations    @xmath155    @xmath233    @xmath175    @xmath234    @xmath235    @xmath236    @xmath237    with @xmath238 .",
    "these represent nine equations for the nine unknown functions @xmath111 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath150 , @xmath131 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "although a complete analysis of the various hydrodynamic modes is now possible , we will consider here only the situation which is most relevant to experiments , namely that the normal part of the two - dimensional system is clamped to an underlying substrate . as a result",
    "we have @xmath243 and eqs .",
    "( [ momrho ] ) and ( [ momdel ] ) determining the normal properties of the supersolid are no longer valid .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations therefore reduce to    [ clamped ] @xmath244 @xmath245    they contain two pairs of propagating modes , which in the limit of a small coupling constant @xmath246 essentially correspond to a pair of third - sound modes with @xmath111 unequal to zero but a constant net defect density and a pair of modes with an oscillating net defect density .",
    "one might have expected that the coupling of a superfluid density to a propagating defect density would have resulted in one pair of gapped excitations and one pair of gapless excitations instead .",
    "consider , for example , two identical superfluid layers .",
    "if the layers are uncoupled the dynamics of the phases @xmath247 and @xmath248 of the layers is determined by the action @xmath249 =   \\int_0^{\\hbar \\beta } d\\tau \\int d\\vec{x}~     \\left\\ { \\frac{\\rho^2}{2b } ( \\partial_{\\tau } \\vartheta_1)^2 +             \\frac{\\rho_s}{2 } ( \\nabla \\vartheta_1)^2           + \\frac{\\rho^2}{2b } ( \\partial_{\\tau } \\vartheta_2)^2 +             \\frac{\\rho_s}{2 } ( \\nabla \\vartheta_2)^2     \\right\\}~,\\ ] ] which clearly has two pairs of gapless ( third - sound ) modes , one pair for each superfluid .",
    "if we couple the order parameters by allowing the particles to tunnel with an amplitude @xmath250 from one layer to the other we must add a josephson coupling @xmath251 = - \\int d\\tau \\int d\\vec{x}~      j \\cos(\\vartheta_1 - \\vartheta_2)\\ ] ] to this action .",
    "the hydrodynamics modes couple to form two in - phase and two out - of - phase excitations . the modes with @xmath247 and @xmath248 oscillating out of phase get gapped ( i.e.@xmath252 for @xmath253 ) and only the modes with @xmath247 and @xmath248 oscillating in phase remain gapless .",
    "yet in eq .",
    "( [ clamped ] ) we find only gapless modes .",
    "this paradox can be resolved by noting that we have made the standard assumption@xcite that both the total number of particles and the net number of defects is conserved .",
    "hence , after an atom has tunneled from a lattice site to the position of a vacancy , a new vacancy is created near the original site of the atom . the analogous process for the two coupled superfluid layers in not simply tunneling of individual atoms from one layer to another , but rather the exchange of a pair of atoms in different layers , returning the system to its original state .",
    "such a process is not a josephson coupling and therefore the modes remain gapless .",
    "the existence of separate conservation laws for the particle and defect density thus allows in principle two separate broken symmetries .",
    "we also note in passing that the third - sound modes in eq .",
    "( [ clamped ] ) are not present in the hydrodynamic equations proposed by andreev and lifshitz @xcite and considered in more detail by liu .",
    "@xcite this is a result of the fact that these authors use a somewhat different physical picture for the supersolid phase : they assume that the superfluid current density is carried by ( bose condensed ) defects and that the normal current density is solely due to lattice vibrations . hence if we take @xmath254 , which in their context means that @xmath255 , only transport of defects is possible and only the latter two modes survive .",
    "however , as a consequence of their picture the hydrodynamic equations in the ( normal ) solid phase describe only longitudinal and transverse sound modes in an ideal lattice and do not include the effect of vacancies or interstitials . as explained above this",
    "is incorrect in principle and one should at least also allow for a normal current density due to the motion of defects .",
    "in addition , we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sop ] that even in the presence of defects the density fluctuations are equal to @xmath256 .",
    "it is therefore perfectly reasonable that if there is superfluid mass transport possible in the solid , it can be caused both by the motion of defects and by lattice vibrations . indeed , as an existence proof of this latter possibility we can for instance consider superfluid @xmath0he in a weak periodic and commensurate potential , which is clearly a supersolid without defects .    while it is generically possible to have both density and defect superfluid modes",
    ", we might expect however , for realistic films on realistic substrates , that in a supersolid it may be harder for particles to perform ring exchanges@xcite than for vacancies to exchange positions .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ , we might expect the effective superfluid stiffness for the density fluctuations to be smaller than that of the vacancies , perhaps to the point where the former is entirely absent .",
    "we next turn to the superhexatic phase . in a similar manner as in sec.[hss",

    "however , considering again the case @xmath254 the hydrodynamic equations now simply reduce to @xmath266 which contains only a pair of third - sound modes with the velocity @xmath267 and the diffusion constant @xmath268 .",
    "in this paper we have derived the hydrodynamic equations for the supersolid and superhexatic phases of a neutral two - dimensional bose fluid . for the supersolid",
    "these equations are rather complex , since they incorporate the effects of defect motion and lattice vibrations on both the normal and superfluid parts of the momentum density .",
    "our physical picture for the influence on the superfluid part is roughly speaking that in a mean - field theory the condensate wavefunction @xmath269 obeys the schrdinger equation @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the mass of the bose particles and @xmath272 is their interaction .",
    "in addition , @xmath273 is the particle density which will be determined by an additional mean - field theory that , for a supersolid , shows the instability associated with the formation of a density wave .",
    "hence the ( thermal ) average @xmath274 is periodic in space and independent of time . as a result",
    "the condensate wavefunction is , if we neglect density fluctuations , also periodic and we have indeed both diagonal as well as off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "fluctuations in the density , however , induce variations in the phase of the wavefunction and therefore in the superfluid velocity .",
    "because these density fluctuations can be caused by both lattice vibrations and oscillations in the net defect density we conclude that both mechanisms can lead to superfluid motion .",
    "together with the existence of a conservation law for the net number of defects , this explains from a more microscopic view why we found two third - sound modes and two modes with an oscillatory net defect density in the case of a supersolid adsorbed onto a substrate .    for the superhexatic phase we have shown that the hexatic long - range order leads to an additional ( as compared to the superfluid )",
    "hydrodynamic degree of freedom that affects only the transverse modes and is therefore at long wavelengths decoupled from the superfluid momentum density .",
    "this can also be understood from the above picture , since variations in the orientational order parameter @xmath150 do not lead to density fluctuations in first instance . as a result we find on a substrate only two third - sound modes and thus at the hydrodynamic level of description nothing to distinguish the superhexatic from the superfluid .",
    "although this is in agreement with the experiments of chen and mochel , who indeed only observe one third - sound branch below the second critical temperature @xmath2 , it is unfortunate for the purpose of suggesting a possible identification of the superhexatic phase . on the basis of our results we can , however , conclude that a more microscopic probe is needed if one wants to detect the orientational order present in a superhexatic helium film . in our opinion",
    "this appears to be an important , but also difficult experimental challenge .",

    "moreover , they notice that their data can be explained by a simple model of two coupled wave equations which turns out to be identical to the longitudonal part of our solid hydrodynamics derived in sec .",
