    "the quantum hall state at filling factor @xmath0 is a paradigm of a strongly - correlated and topologically ordered phase with anyonic excitations .",
    "it is described by the laughlin wave function  @xcite , which received compelling support by exact diagonalization of small finite - size systems  @xcite .",
    "the state is experimentally realized when the lowest landau level ( lll ) of a two - dimensional electron gas ( for example , in a semiconductor heterostructure ) contains one electron per three magnetic flux quanta .",
    "its main experimental signature is a quantization of the transverse conductance and simultaneous vanishing of the longitudinal resistivity in transport  @xcite .",
    "however , an analogous state can be envisioned in a situation when the first excited landau level ( ll1 ) is 1/3-filled , while the lll for both up and down spin components is fully filled , corresponding to total filling of 7/3 .",
    "indeed , experiments detect a quantized plateau at @xmath1 , although significantly weaker than in the lll  @xcite .",
    "if the two filled copies of the lll are considered inert , the state in the valence ll1 should be similar to the laughlin state , though not equivalent because the effective coulomb interaction , projected to ll1 , differs by a form - factor from the one projected to the lll  @xcite .",
    "the change of the interaction due to form - factor can be significant : for example , at half filling of the lll , a compressible , fermi - liquid - like state is realized , whereas a quantized state ( possibly related to the moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite ) occurs at half - filling of ll1 .",
    "therefore , although it is plausible that 1/3 and 7/3 states should be similar to each other , one must resort to numerical calculations to verify such an assertion .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 , numerical calculations on @xmath1 have been more scarce .",
    "as will become obvious in the following , finite - size effects at 7/3 are drastically larger than at 1/3 , requiring very large system sizes that are on the verge of the current limit of exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "this necessitates approximate tools such as the density - matrix renormalization group  @xcite ( dmrg ) .",
    "it was noted early on by haldane  @xcite that the ground state of 7/3 is in the vicinity of a compressible phase .",
    "small perturbations , for example by softening the coulomb interaction as a result of finite sample - thickness , were shown to drive the system into the incompressible phase  @xcite . given the compelling accuracy of laughlin s theory for 1/3 , it is thus plausible that the phase diagram at @xmath1 indeed contains the state in the same universality class , with the caveat that there may be other compressible phases in the vicinity , which complicate the theoretical analysis . most recently , ref .",
    "studied the quasiparticles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 states using  composite - fermion diagonalization \" , and reporting that latter are surprisingly larger objects in size .    in light of the above ,",
    "a quantitative comparison of @xmath6 and @xmath7 states from the perspective of the size of their elementary quasiparticle excitations using direct numerical calculations for realistic interactions seems extremely desirable . in this paper",
    ", we describe such a study , using unbiased exact diagonalization as well as density - matrix renormalization group methods .",
    "furthermore , we discuss two types of boundary conditions  sphere and cylinder geometry  each of which has its unique strengths and weaknesses from the point of view of numerical calculations . bootstrapping the results from these different techniques and boundary conditions , we establish reliable bounds for the sizes of quasiholes at @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 , providing further support for the conclusion in ref .  .",
    "the size of a quasihole provides a fundamental characterization of a given quantum hall state . for model",
    "quantum hall wave functions , quasiholes can be created by a simple flux - insertion operation , and their sizes can be estimated using jack polynomials  @xcite or analytical matrix - product state ansatz based on conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "however , quasiholes of generic ( coulomb interaction ) ground states may have significant corrections from these values , and must be computed separately . in practice , this is done by diagonalizing the interaction hamiltonian with a specially designed  impurity \" potential at a given location , whose role is to create a charge deficit and localize a quasihole at a given point  @xcite . in order to do this",
    ", the magnetic flux also must be increased by an appropriate number of units with respect to the ground state . because the flux has been increased ,",
    "the state is now compressible , and the size of the quasihole will in general depend on the pinning potential . if the ground state is robust ( large excitation gap ) , various types of pinning potentials can be used to localize the quasiholes , and the resulting size is largely insensitive to the details of the potentials .",
    "however , in the case of fragile states , such as the 7/3 state , we will see below that only certain kinds of potentials are able to localize the quasihole , and require special parameter tuning .",
    "in addition to its size , in a system of more than one quasihole , it is possible to braid different quasiholes around one another , and compute the associated berry phases that determine their mutual statistics .",
    "this type of calculation requires creating at least two quasiholes and ensuring they are well - separated from each other , for which it is necessary to have a reliable estimate of their size .",
    "more importantly , similar measurements can be realized in actual interferometry experiments@xcite , where the present results should prove useful as a guideline for the size of the quantum point contacts through which the quasiholes are expected to tunnel .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we provide a brief outline of the quantum hall problem in the spherical and cylinderical geometry , with an emphasis on different types of pinning potentials .",
    "we also briefly discuss the implementation of our methods , exact diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization group . in sec .",
    "[ sphere ] , we present the results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 quasihole in the spherical geometry . in sec .  [ cylinder ] we present analogous results for the cylinder geometry and highlight some special aspects of this boundary condition .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in the present work we consider a finite quantum hall system on the surface of a sphere  @xcite or a cylinder  @xcite . the two geometries are formally similar , but a finite cylinder has two open boundaries ( the electron density can extend beyond the edges even though the number of orbitals and electrons in the finite - size system is a constant ) , and allows the edge excitations that are absent on the sphere .",
    "spherical geometry is discussed at length in ref .  , and additional details on cylinder geometry will be provided elsewhere  @xcite .    in both cases ,",
    "we consider @xmath8 electrons in an area enclosing @xmath9 flux quanta . for the sphere",
    ", the strength of the magnetic flux automatically defines the radius of the sphere : @xmath10 . in the case of cylinder",
    ", the flux @xmath11 must be equal to the area of the cylinder @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the perimeter , and @xmath14 is the height of the cylinder .",
    "this naturally introduces the aspect ratio , @xmath15 , as an additional parameter .",
    "fluid states are expected to be realized in the regime @xmath16 , hence @xmath17 .",
    "if one of the dimensions of the cylinder is much smaller than the other , states with other types of order become preferred  @xcite .    in order to study a single quasihole , we choose @xmath18 , i.e. one unit of flux in addition to the ground state flux of the laughlin state . in this case , the system contains a single quasihole excitation with fractional charge  @xcite @xmath19 . for the laughlin wave function , @xmath20 ,",
    "it is straightforward to construct a quasihole localized at a given point @xmath21 : @xmath22 it can be easily shown that such a defect has the correct charge @xmath23 and obeys anyonic statistics  @xcite .     above the north pole . ]",
    "a practical way to work with eq .",
    "( [ laughlinqh ] ) is to notice that when @xmath21 corresponds to one of the poles of the sphere , the wave function ( [ laughlinqh ] ) still has @xmath24 symmetry and can be expressed as a single jack polynomial  @xcite labeled by the partition @xmath25 and parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this is true only for the pole ; wave function for the quasihole localized anywhere else on the sphere is a more complicated superposition of several jack polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the same is true for the cylinder as well : a localized quasihole wave function on the cylinder is in general a superposition of several jack polynomials .    to characterize the spatial extent of the quasihole defect , we compute the  excess charge \" ( integrated deviation of the density from the background density of the ground state ) @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the density of the quasihole state at the spherical angle @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 is the density of the ground state ( a trivial constant on the sphere ) , and the integral is over the unit sphere ( @xmath31 as a function of distance @xmath32 in physical units is obtained by simple rescaling with @xmath33 at the end ) .    for the quasihole created at @xmath34 on the cylinder ,",
    "the formula should be modified as : @xmath35 where @xmath13 is the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "the background density @xmath30 is no longer a constant due to open boundaries .",
    "the charge is integrated over the @xmath36-axis so that calculating @xmath37 requires only the knowledge of diagonal matrix elements of the density operator .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that @xmath38 and @xmath30 have been rescaled to the same size as the number of orbitals in the two cases differs by 1 .",
    "a criterion for a well - localized quasihole within a certain length @xmath39 is that the limiting value of @xmath31 at large distances @xmath40 approaches @xmath41 , but in such a way that it develops a plateau at 1/3 that grows as system size is increased .     of the point charge",
    "potential , projected into @xmath42 and @xmath43 ll ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . ]",
    "now we discuss different choices for the potential of the impurity probe that is meant to localize the quasihole of the coulomb interaction ground states at 1/3 or 7/3 . as mentioned before ,",
    "if we have obtained the ground state @xmath46 of the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath47 , we add a perturbation @xmath48 that is not strong enough to cause any major level - crossings in the low - lying part of the spectrum of @xmath47 .",
    "then , the combined ground state of @xmath49 would yield a quasihole localized at @xmath21 , provided that we have chosen an appropriate form of @xmath50 .",
    "a natural place to look for possible @xmath50 is among short - range one - body potentials such as the projection of delta interaction , fig .",
    "[ fig : qh ] : @xmath51 those might , in some sense , model the stm tip brought to the vicinity of two - dimensional electron gas  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one might consider longer - range potentials with the gaussian profile parametrized by @xmath52 : @xmath53 it appears to us , however , that the most realistic potential should be the long - range coulomb potential of a charge @xmath54 brought to some distance @xmath55 near the electron system  @xcite .",
    "for the sphere , it is convenient to place this charge above the pole , in order to preserve @xmath24 symmetry : @xmath56 in all the models , @xmath54 is an overall constant that can be varied .",
    "additionally , one can explore further range of potentials by tuning @xmath52 or @xmath55 ( we have considered the range between @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "-axis and gaussian localized along @xmath59 ) , and an impurity @xmath54 .",
    "localizing the quasihole at any given point lifts the symmetry and momentum along the cylinder is no longer a good quantum number . ]",
    "having defined the choices for impurity potentials , the actual implementation consists of evaluating the matrix elements @xmath60 between the one - body wave functions in the lll or ll1 .",
    "because these wave functions come with different form factors in two lls , the corresponding matrix elements will also be slightly different , especially in the short - range part , as fig .",
    "[ fig : coulombpotential ] illustrates .",
    "we would like to emphasize that cylinder geometry has several features that distinguish it from the sphere .",
    "first , the presence of two edges is detrimental for studying the bulk properties of the system , and much larger system sizes are required to reach the bulk of a given size compared the sphere .",
    "secondly , in contrast to other dmrg studies  @xcite , we are interested in the long - range coulomb interaction which requires a confining potential on a finite cylinder .",
    "if the state is fragile , like @xmath1 , very fine tuning of the confining potential will be necessary to locate the right phase .",
    "detailed comparison of the confining potentials is explained elsewhere  @xcite ; here we use the potential due to a line of positive charge along the axis of the cylinder , which also ensures the overall charge - neutrality of the system .",
    "having specified our hamiltonian , we then represent it in the basis of slater determinants , @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 label the one - particle eigenstates of @xmath24 angular momentum projection on the sphere ( or @xmath63 momentum on the cylinder ) . in the absence of an impurity",
    ", total momentum is conserved , and the hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized in sectors of fixed total @xmath24 or @xmath63 . in the presence of an impurity , however , this symmetry will in general",
    "be lifted . in the case of the sphere , by positioning the impurity above one of the poles , we are able to preserve the symmetry .",
    "this does not hold for the cylinder , where in principle all @xmath63 sectors must be considered simultaneously . in practice",
    ", however , we find that it is only necessary to keep a few sectors because of the gaussian cut - off .",
    "for example , if we want to localize a quasihole in the middle of the cylinder ( @xmath34 ) , we keep the sectors @xmath64 , where @xmath65 can be varied until convergence is achieved . in order to find the ground state of the hamiltonian , we use exact diagonalization , as well as density - matrix renormalization ( dmrg ) group  @xcite ( for details of our dmrg implementation , see ref .  ) .",
    "in this section , we present results for the size of the quasihole at @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the spherical geometry . before discussing the quasihole , however",
    ", we would like to comment on the nature of the ground state itself in the two cases . while there is little doubt that @xmath0 coulomb ground state is described by the laughlin wave function",
    ", there remains some doubt  @xcite if the same is true of @xmath1 , because finite systems of up to @xmath66 show very strong finite - size effects .",
    "in particular , the counting of entanglement spectrum levels for @xmath1 matched only a few of the laughlin state , and the corresponding entanglement gap was small or even non - existent , although it improved when the system size was increased from @xmath67 to @xmath66  @xcite .",

    "we have extended the calculation in ref .   by exactly diagonalizing @xmath71 particles at @xmath1 .",

    "the momentum of the lowest states corresponds to the one derived from the root partition @xmath72 , and the counting reads @xmath73 .",
    "we observe an entanglement gap separating these levels from the rest of the spectrum , similar to other quantum hall states , though the value of the gap is small in this case , indicating the fragility of the state .",

    "the overlap squared with the laughlin wave function is 33% . given a steady emergence of the laughlin physics as @xmath8 is increased from 10 through 14 , we believe that the @xmath1 ground state on the sphere indeed is described by laughlin s theory .    .",

    "this indicates that the delta function impurity potential might be insufficient to localize a quasihole in ll1 .        to explore whether a longer range potential , such as the gaussian potential in eq .",
