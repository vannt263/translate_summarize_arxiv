    ", it is well known that noise in electronic components or brownian motion of small particles increase with temperature .",
    "but does the amplitude of fluctuations of physical properties always increase with @xmath1 ?",
    "recently a spectacular exception from this rule was reported almost simultaneously by three groups of researchers @xcite .",
    "it was observed that fluctuations of the bias current required for switching of a josephson junction ( jj ) from the superconducting ( @xmath2 ) to the resistive ( @xmath3 ) state may suddenly collapse ( drastically decrease ) at elevated @xmath1 .",
    "it was suggested that the paradoxical behavior is caused by the fact that temperature does not only provide energy for excitation of a system from the equilibrium state but also enhance the rate of relaxation back to the equilibrium .",
    "the latter strongly depends on the damping in the system and under certain circumstances can reverse the correlation between fluctuations and temperature .",
    "dissipation plays a crucial role in decay of metastable states , which determines dynamics of various physical and chemical processes @xcite .",
    "switching between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states in jj s is one of the best studied examples of such a decay .",
    "the influence of dissipation on the switching statistics of jj s has been intensively studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the role of dissipation in decoherence of quantum systems has been widely discussed @xcite and has recently become an important issue for quantum computing .",
    "jj s are used in several different ways in qubit implementations .",
    "for example , current biased jj s are employed in phase qubits @xcite , where the dissipation affects relaxation and decoherence in the qubits .",
    "furthermore , switching of jj s is also used for read - out of both flux @xcite and charge - phase @xcite qubits .    here",
    "we present an extensive study of dissipation effects on the phase dynamics in moderately damped jj s . for this purpose we prepared several types of junctions with well controlled and tunable damping parameters .",
    "in particular , we study low ohmic nb - pt - nb superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions , nb - cuni - nb superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) junctions with a diluted feromagnetic alloys , and nb - inas - nb superconductor - two dimensional electron gas - superconductor ( s-2deg - s ) junctions , as well as bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( bi-2212 ) high-@xmath0 ( htsc ) intrinsic jj s .",
    "the influence of dissipation on thermal and quantum fluctuations is studied by tuning damping parameters of the junctions by temperature , magnetic field , gate voltage , introducing a ferromagnetic layer or capacitive shunting .",
    "the paradoxical collapse of switching current fluctuations with increasing @xmath1 was observed in all cases .",
    "it is shown that the collapse temperature critically depends on dissipation in the junction .",
    "the phenomenon is explained by interplay of two conflicting consequences of thermal fluctuations , which on one hand assist in premature switching to the resistive state and on the other hand help in retrapping back to the superconducting state .",
    "the conclusions are supported by analytical calculations and numerical simulations , which are in quantitative agreement with new experimental data presented here as well as with those reported in refs .",

    "vi we discuss the mechanism of the paradoxical collapse of ta in moderately damped jj s and present numeric and analytic calculations , which clarify the phase dynamics in the collapsed state and support our conclusions .",

    "conflicting reports exists on what determines the effective damping in sis junctions : the normal resistance @xcite , the high frequency impedance of circuitry @xcite , the quasiparticle resistance @xcite , or the up - transformed lead impedance @xcite .",

    "the unusual phenomenon was explained by an interplay of two conflicting consequences of thermal fluctuations , which on the one hand assist in premature switching to the @xmath18state and on the other hand help in retrapping back into the @xmath19state . in this case",
    "the probability of measuring a switching event becomes a conditional probability of switching and not being retrapped during the time of the experiment .",
    "numerical calculations has shown that this model provides a quantitative explanation of both the value of the collapse temperature @xmath194 , and the unusual shape of switching histograms in the collapsed state .",
    "based on the theoretical analysis , we conclude that the collapse represents a very general phenomenon , which must occur in any underdamped jj at sufficiently high @xmath1 .",
    "the collapse of switching current fluctuations in josephson junctions represents an exception from the law of increasing of thermal fluctuations with temperature . in the studied case , the `` failure '' of this general law of nature ,",
    "is caused by coexistence of two counteracting processes ( switching and retrapping ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that fluctuations for each of the two processes alone follow the law and enhance with @xmath1 in a conventional manner .",
    "it is , however , remarkable and unusual that fluctuations may cancel each other and lead to reduction of thermal fluctuations of a physically measurable quantity .",
    "finally , we note that the reduced width of switching histograms in the collapsed state of moderately damped jj s may be advantageous for single - shot read - out of superconducting qubits , which requires accurate discrimination of two close current states .",

    "the studied bi-2212 structure had a triple - mesa configuration , containing two contact mesas on top of a common pedestal .",
    "this allowed four - probe measurement of ijj s in the pedestal mesa , shown in fig .",
    "the switching statistics in figs .",
    "11 , 13 and 17 was obtained from a stable switching of one of the ijj s from the contact mesa .",
    "since contact mesas had approximately two times smaller area than the pedestal mesa , ijj s in the contact mesa had approximately two times smaller critical current , as seen from comparison of figs .",
