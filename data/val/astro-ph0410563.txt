    "polarimetry has become a fundamental part of solar physics and is rapidly gaining importance in many other fields of astrophysics@xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging problems that one faces when doing astronomical polarimetry is the determination of the instrumental polarization introduced by the telescope in the observed beam .",
    "there are two approaches that have been used to deal with this problem .",
    "the first one is to place calibration optics at the telescope entrance , which allows one to feed light in a known state of polarization into the system .",
    "the measured stokes parameters can then be used to determine the telescope response with a very high degree of accuracy .",
    "two solar telescopes currently use this strategy : the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) , at the sacramento peak observatory ( nm , usa ) operated by the national solar observatories , and the german vacuum tower telescope ( vtt ) at the observatorio del teide of the instituto de astrof ' isica de canarias ( spain ) . the swedish solar tower at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( also of the instituto de astrof ' isica de canarias )",
    "will soon have this capability , as well .    the second approach to determine the telescope polarimetric response is to observe relatively well - known astronomical sources of polarization .",
    "this is sometimes done in night - time astronomy by observing `` standard stars '' . in solar physics , this may be accomplished with observations of a sunspot .",
    "the procedure@xcite considers milne - eddington fits ( mef ) to sunspot umbra spectra , from which the elements of the telescope mueller matrix are adjusted to minimize the residuals of the mef to the observed data .",
    "it is generally desirable to have a purely instrumental telescope calibration , so that no _ a priori _ assumptions on the observed targets are needed .",
    "unfortunately , the construction of calibration optics for a large aperture ( larger than @xmath01  m ) is impractical .",
    "this had not been an issue in the past because existing solar telescopes have apertures that do not exceed 1  m in diameter , whereas larger night - time telescopes did not require absolute polarimetric accuracies higher than what can be routinely achieved by means of standard stars .",
    "this situation , however , is rapidly changing due to the ever increasing accuracy demands of astronomical polarimetry and the development of new large - aperture solar telescopes , like the german telescope gregor@xcite or the advanced technology solar telescope@xcite @xcite ( atst ) .",
    "a previous paper@xcite introduced the `` beam - expansion '' method ( bem ) for the instrumental calibration of a large telescope .",
    "this work presents a different procedure , the sub - aperture method , which has some interesting advantages over the bem ( at least for the particular case of the atst design ) .",
    "we shall hereafter consider the problem of calibrating the atst , but the proposed procedure may be easily applicable to other telescopes as well .",
    "the sub - aperture method is based on the following basic idea .",
    "one starts by effectively turning the atst into a small - aperture telescope .",
    "this is done by inserting a mask into the beam at any pupil image .",
    "the telescope sub - aperture is calibrated as usual by means of calibration polarization optics above the primary mirror . an astronomical polarization source ( e.g. , a sunspot )",
    "is observed through the sub - aperture and then again with the full aperture .",
    "the two observations are only a few seconds apart in time .",
    "the sub - aperture calibration is used to remove instrumental polarization in the first observation , which allows one to determine the actual stokes vectors emerging from the astronomical source .",
    "once these input vectors are known , the full aperture observation can be used to calibrate the telescope .",
    "the sub - aperture method proposed in this work requires the following elements .",
    "note that , for the case of the atst , requirement  1 is probably the most demanding one .    1 .   a mechanical mount is needed to slide calibration optics in and out of the beam before the primary mirror .",
    "the calibration optics may have a small diameter ( see next point ) and consist of an achromatic linear polarizer and a retarder .",
    "the polarizer and retarder can rotate and be inserted and removed independently of one another .",
    "it is important to realize that the calibration optics does not need to be placed over the center of the aperture .",
    "it could be at any location over the primary mirror , e.g. near the outer edge of the telescope aperture .",
    "this consideration probably simplifies the design of the mechanical mount , since it does not need to extend all the way into the center of the aperture .",
    "moreover , there is an additional advantage for off - axis telescopes like the atst . by having the sub - aperture closer to the axis of the system , rather than the aperture center ,",
    "the instrumental polarization of the sub - aperture is minimized .",
    "this is of relevance because , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : simul ] , the level of accuracy achieved is limited by the accuracy of the sub - aperture calibration .",
    "2 .   the diameter of the calibration optics ( @xmath1 ) may be as small as desired , provided only that it fills an aperture large enough to observe the source of polarization .",
    "typically this would be a sunspot",
    ". however , there may be times of low solar activity in which no sunspots are available .",
    "in such cases plage regions may be employed as sources .",
    "a suitable value for @xmath1 is probably between 20  cm and 40  cm ( see  [ sec : simul ] ) .",
    "3 .   a blocking mask that can be inserted in the beam independently of the calibration optics is required .",
    "the location of the mask can be any position in the system where an image of the telescope pupil is formed .",
    "it may be at the entrance ( e.g. , the dome shutter ) or , perhaps more convenient , at any location downstream in a collimated beam ( which would make it a small element ) .",
    "the purpose of the mask is to block the rays in the light beam that did not pass through the calibration optics . in other words ,",
    "when the mask is in the beam the telescope aperture is reduced to @xmath1 .",
    "the alignment between the mask and the calibration optics does not need to be very accurate .",
    "we simply require that only light that passed through the calibration optics can get through the mask .",
    "the procedure proposed to calibrate the optical train is as follows :    1 .   slide calibration optics into the beam 2 .",
    "slide mask into the beam . only polarized",
    "light passes through .",
    "calibration stokes vectors are measured for various configurations of the calibration optics , in the same way as it is presently done with other solar telescopes .",
    "if @xmath2 represents the mueller matrix of the small - aperture telescope+instrument system , we have that : @xmath3 4 .   from ( known ) inputs @xmath4 and ( measured ) outputs @xmath5 ,",
    "determine @xmath2 . in general the measured mueller matrix , that we denote by @xmath6 ,",
    "is affected of small errors .",
    "@xmath7 5 .",
    "remove calibration optics , _ but leave mask in_. 6 .",
    "observe solar source of polarization ( e.g. , a sunspot ) through mini - aperture of diameter @xmath1 : @xmath8 7 .",
    "remove mask and repeat same observation using full aperture .",
    "only a few seconds pass between the observations with and without the mask .",
    "if @xmath9 is the mueller matrix of the full - aperture telescope+instrument system , we have : @xmath10 8 .",
    "calibrate small - aperture solar observations @xmath11 to obtain @xmath12 : @xmath13 9 .",
    "use known @xmath14 and measured @xmath15 to determine @xmath16 .",
    "the following assumption is implicit : @xmath17    there are two important assumptions in the procedure as outlined above . the first one is given by eq  ( [ appr1 ] ) and requires that the calibration of the sub - aperture must be done with sufficient accuracy .",
    "possible errors in this step will affect the full aperture calibration through eq  ( [ appr2 ] ) .",
    "the second assumption is that of eq  ( [ approx12 ] ) . in order for it to be accurate ,",
    "it is important that the two observations @xmath18 and @xmath19 be taken as close in time as possible .",
    "it is also important that the field of view remain the same , especially when doing slit spectroscopy .",
    "possible discrepancies in the telescope pointing between the two observations need to be much smaller than the spatial structure of the polarization source . this would probably not be an issue when an adaptive optics system is employed to compensate for seeing - induced wave - front distortion .",
    "however , it is not yet clear that the adaptive optics system of the atst will be able to operate while in calibration mode .",
    "the validity of these two assumptions , and the degree to which they limit the accuracy of the telescope calibration , is explored by means of numerical simulations in  [ sec : simul ] .",
    "this section describes some numerical experiments aimed at estimating the accuracy of the sub - aperture method and its limitations .",
    "the simulations consist of several `` hound and hares '' type of tests , in which one seeks to determine a telescope matrix which is known beforehand .",
    "i have used calibrated data from the asp instrument to simulate a set of solar stokes vectors ( @xmath14 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the simulated solar data is observed through a small sub - aperture system ( characterized by its mueller matrix @xmath2 ) and through the full system ( with mueller matrix @xmath16 ) .",
    "obviously , the actual mueller matrix of the atst is still unknown . using that of an existing telescope is probably not very helpful , since their mueller matrices are likely to be very different .",
    "the approach taken in this work is to perform montecarlo simulations with a large number of randomly chosen mueller matrices that represent the telescope . according to reference @xcite , off - diagonal elements of up to",
    "@xmath215% are to be expected due to the off - axis geometry of the atst .",
    "therefore , it seems appropriate to consider matrices of the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the 4@xmath244 identity matrix and @xmath25 is a particular realization of a 4@xmath244 matrix whose elements are random real numbers obeying a normal distribution of width 1 .",
    "two different asp maps are used in the simulations .",
    "the first one ( map  a)@xcite contains a sunspot and some plage regions .",
    "the second ( map  b)@xcite is a quiet sun map and is used here to explore the feasibility of the sub - aperture method with quiet sun signals .",
    "fig  [ fig : maps ] shows the observations and the three slit positions that have been used as solar polarization sources ( sunspot , plage and network ) .",
    "let us discuss the numerical experiments in some detail .",
    "we start by taking some spectra from one of the slit position marked in fig  [ fig : maps ]",
    ". these will be our solar input stokes vectors from the first observation [ @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes spatial position along the slit and @xmath28 represents the spectral variable ] . an observation through the telescope sub - aperture is simulated as : @xmath29 the variation of @xmath2 with wavelength is slow and can be neglected over the spectral range recorded by the detector ( typically a few  ) .",
    "a second set of stokes spectra @xmath30 is obtained from the same map , but at a slightly different slit position .",
    "let us denote the offset between the two observations by @xmath31 .",
    "these vectors are observed using the full aperture : @xmath32    random noise is added to both @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the noise has a normal distribution and has a larger amplitude for the case of @xmath33 as a result of the smaller observing aperture ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "i have simulated an exposure time of @xmath04  seconds in both cases , which results in a noise amplitude of @xmath35 ( with @xmath1 given in meters ) for @xmath33 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "obviously , it would be possible to use longer exposure times , thus reducing the noise in the observations .    at this point",
    "we have the simulated solar observations and the telescope matrices used to generate them .",
    "next we need to apply the procedure described in  [ sec : proc ] to the simulated data and compare the retrieved matrix @xmath38 to the actual @xmath16 generated earlier .    in a real situation ,",
    "one starts by using the calibration optics to obtain the mueller matrix ( or at least an approximation ) of the sub - aperture system @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 resulting from the measurements should be a good approximation to the actual @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the asp calibration yields an accuracy@xcite better than @xmath40 .",
    "the tests presented in this section consider that : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a parameter that accounts for the accuracy of the sub - aperture calibration ( e.g. , for asp @xmath43 , as stated above ) and @xmath44 is again a matrix of random elements .",
    "several experiments with different values of @xmath42 have been carried out in order to explore the propagation of errors from the calibration of the sub - aperture to the full aperture system ( see below ) .",
    "finally , one needs to perform steps  8 and  9 of the procedure detailed in  [ sec : proc ] .",
    "a least - squares algorithm is employed to determine the @xmath16 matrix by solving the following system : @xmath45 instead of using all the possible stokes vectors observed at every @xmath46 point along the slit , it is numerically convenient to select a suitable less redundant subset .",
    "the strength of the polarization signal of the @xmath47 is used as a selection criterion .",
    "a total of 280 vectors , consisting of the 40 points with the largest positive values of q , -q , u , -u , v , -v plus the 40 points with lowest total polarization , are selected .",
    "although the number of vectors has been chosen rather arbitrarily , the procedure is not very sensitive to it .",
    "this value was adopted after verifying that , in selected simulations , doubling it resulted in no accuracy improvement .",
    "the least - squares fitting results in a @xmath38 matrix that can be straightforwardly compared to @xmath16 . in this manner it is possible to study the propagation of errors and the overall accuracy of the sub - aperture method .",
    "the entire process has been repeated 100 times for each one of the simulations , with different realizations of the random matrices that appear in eqs  ( [ random ] ) .",
    "the results presented below are the mean - square errors from the montecarlo simulations .",
    "let us start the discussion in this section with a simple reference case .",
    "consider for instance a diameter of @xmath48  m for the calibration optics and a calibration accuracy @xmath49 .",
    "the solar source is a sunspot ( slit position 1 in fig  [ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "let us assume for the moment that the telescope pointing has not changed between the two observations ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the propagation of errors and noise through the calibration procedure ( as explained above ) leads to the following error matrix @xmath51 : @xmath52    notice that the second and third columns , which correspond to cross - talk from q and u , are larger than the other two .",
    "this is due to the fact that the linear polarization signals are considerably weaker than i and v , even in the penumbra where the linear polarization is strongest .",
    "fortunately , the atst polarimetric accuracy requirement ( the amount of cross - talk must be smaller than @xmath40 ) does not necessarily imply that the matrix elements of @xmath53 have to be all smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "typically , v is @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the continuum intensity ) and q , u are @xmath56 .",
    "this means that , in order to meet this requirement , the elements in the first column of @xmath53 must be smaller than @xmath40 , those in the second and third smaller than @xmath57 , and those in the fourth smaller than @xmath58 ( see reference @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "these values are used as derived requirements for the atst polarimetric accuracy in the discussion below .",
    "fig  [ fig : tests1 ] shows how the calibration error varies with the sub - aperture diameter @xmath1 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line marks the atst accuracy requirements for each column of @xmath16 .",
    "cross - talk terms from i are almost at the required level for @xmath59  cm ( upper left panel ) . a slightly lower @xmath42 would be needed to fully meet the atst requirement ( see below ) . the situation is better for the other stokes parameters , but only when using a sunspot as the polarization source .",
    "plage and quiet sun fields can be used to determine the first and fourth columns of @xmath16 at atst levels .",
    "however , the second and third columns ( cross - talk from q and u ) exhibit very large inaccuracies .",
    "the reason for this is that the observations used here have been taken at disk center and show very little linear polarization . in order to fully determine the q and u terms of the telescope matrix from plage or quiet sun regions",
    ", one would also need near - limb observations which exhibit linear polarization signals .",
    "it is possible to achieve the required accuracy by calibrating the sub - aperture to the level of @xmath60 , as shown in fig  [ fig : tests2 ] .",
    "notice in that figure that the telescope calibration accuracy is strongly related to that of the sub - aperture .",
    "also in fig  [ fig : tests2 ] we can see the uncertainties introduced by pointing errors between the observation of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the method is not compromised by errors as large as 0.75  arc - seconds and is therefore robust enough to be employed even in the absence of adaptive optics .    ) .",
    "solid : no pointing error ( @xmath31 ) . dashed : @xmath31=0.75 arc - seconds .",

    "the horizontal dotted line represents the atst polarimetric accuracy requirement .",
    "[ fig : tests2 ] , scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the sub - aperture method has the following advantages over the bem and mef :    * unlike mef , no _ a priori _ assumptions are made on the observed targets ( physical model , profile shape or symmetry , etc ) . * simpler design modifications than bem .",
