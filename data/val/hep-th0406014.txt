    "classical liouville theory is well understood even if it can be solved explicitly only in special cases .",
    "quantum liouville theory was first developed in the hamiltonian framework @xcite .",
    "later , functional techniques were applied to the euclidean version of the theory .    within the functional formulation there",
    "exist the so called standard approach @xcite and the geometric approach @xcite . in the first case one",
    "introduces the vertex function by adding to the liouville action external currents as is usually done in quantum field theory . within",
    "the geometric approach one starts from the regularized classical action in presence of boundary terms that represent the sources and then considers the fluctuations of the field around the classical background .    in this paper",
    "we shall compare the standard and the geometric formulations of quantum liouville theory on the sphere and the pseudosphere with particular attention to the pseudosphere @xcite , where the perturbative results are directly compared .",
    "both formulations need to be regularized and such a regularization process is crucial , since the results depend non trivially on the adopted regularization procedure .    in the geometric approach",
    "the action is defined through a limit process and such a structure is not so easy to use in explicit calculations .",
    "however it is possible , by introducing a background field and a source field , to rewrite the action in a form such that no limit procedure appears .",
    "this structure is not as elegant as the original one , but from it one can read directly the transformation properties of the off shell action and consequently also of the correlation functions .",
    "this form can be used as a starting point for perturbative calculations of the correlation functions of vertex operators on the pseudosphere .    as first shown in @xcite ,",
    "the appealing properties of the geometric action is to transform under conformal transformations as the vertex correlation functions of the quantum theory , generating quantum conformal dimensions @xmath0 , which are those found in the hamiltonian approach , provided the central charges are properly identified .    on the sphere , due to the bounds imposed by the picard inequalities ,",
    "the situation is more complex and in this paper we shall perform perturbative computations only on the pseudosphere .    with regard to the one point function",
    "the main outcome will be the following : the results of the two formulations agree up to order @xmath1 included for the values of the first cumulant @xmath2 , provided one properly identifies the coupling constant @xmath3 of the geometric approach as a function of the coupling constant @xmath4 of the standard approach and the same for the cosmological constants . in order to match the value of the second cumulant @xmath5 , one has to introduce by hand a coupling constant dependence in the source subtraction term of the geometric action .",
    "such a @xmath3 dependent subtraction influences only the second cumulant and has no effects on the other cumulants ( @xmath2 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 ) .",
    "a significant test of the equivalence of the two perturbative expansions can be achieved by computing the third cumulant @xmath8 .",
    "this is easily done to first order , yet some improvement in the computational technique is needed both in the standard and geometric approach , in order to get the third order coefficient . the explicit computation of the third cumulant to order @xmath9 within the standard approach",
    "has been given in @xcite and it disagrees with the result of the geometric approach computed in section [ one point function ] of the present paper .    from the general field",
    "theoretical point of view we find that within the geometric approach the asymptotic value of the the vacuum expectation value of the liouville field reproduces the classical background value .",
    "this does not happen within the standard approach , where the two asymptotic behaviors agree only qualitatively .",
    "on the other hand , within the standard approach the field @xmath10 , which appears in the cosmological term , transforms like a @xmath11 primary field , while within the geometric approach the analogous field @xmath12 has not such a transformation property because its quantum conformal dimensions are @xmath13 .",
    "the different characters of the operators appearing in the cosmological terms of the two approaches has been already noticed by takhtajan @xcite .",
    "here we find a difference respectively at the second and third order in the perturbative expansion of the second and third cumulant and these differences can not be matched consistently by a redefinition of the coupling constants .",
    "the obtained results can be compared to the perturbative expansion of the formula conjectured by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov ( zz ) for the one point function on the pseudosphere @xcite .",
    "complete agreement has been found with the perturbative computation within the standard approach up to the third order @xcite . to gain deeper insight , we shall move further through the perturbative computation of the two point function on the pseudosphere .",
    "this allows not only a better comparison between the two approaches but also to compare the results with another conjecture @xcite , i.e. the two point function when one vertex is the degenerate field @xmath14 .",
    "the interest of this computation is that , by taking a proper ratio of two and one point functions , we can extract quantities not depending on the possible ambiguities in the subtraction terms of the geometric approach .",
    "once more we find that the two point functions are different within the two approaches and that the perturbative results of the standard approach agree with the perturbative expansion of the formula conjectured through the bootstrap method .",
    "a deeper inspection shows that the origin of the differences between the results obtained within the two approaches lies in the different regulators employed and not in the way used to introduce the sources .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that adopting the zz regulator both the approaches produce the same results , identifying exactly the couplings and the cosmological constants .",
    "the discrepancy in the structure of the unperturbed dimensions is matched by the different origin of the zero order in the second cumulant of the one point function .",
    "for all the other orders there is a one to one correspondence between the contributions .",
    "the pseudosphere can be represented on the upper half plane or on the unit disk @xmath15 .",
    "we shall use mostly the disk representation .",

    "with such a regulator , one obtains the same results of the standard approach to all orders .",

    "+ another difference between the two approaches is the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath268 , defined as @xmath269 within the geometric approach with the @xmath123 regulator one obtains @xmath270 that is exactly the boundary condition ( [ phi pseudosphere at infty ] ) and ( [ phib pseudosphere at infty ] ) with @xmath60 , imposed respectively on the liouville field @xmath17 and on the background field @xmath31 .",

    "+ thus , the main difference between the standard and the geometric approach is not so much in the way one uses to introduce the sources , but in the regulator chosen to make the divergent graphs finite , which reflects in itself the quantum nature of the cosmological term , deeply related the boundary behaviour of @xmath273 .",
    "in this paper we have compared the standard and the geometric approaches to quantum liouville theory on the sphere and on the pseudosphere .",
    "detailed perturbative calculations up to three loops have been performed on the pseudosphere in both approaches .    the geometric approach , even if invariant under @xmath46 group like the one of @xcite , gives different results with respect to standard approach @xcite .",
    "a feature of the geometric approach , already noticed in @xcite , is that it provides the cosmological term with quantum conformal dimensions @xmath115 , while the standard approach gives @xmath11 for them . moreover , while the perturbative calculations in the standard approach agree with the conformal bootstrap formulas of @xcite , this does not happen for the results obtained within the geometric approach .",
    "both theories exhibit background invariance , yet they are definitely different .",
    "a deeper analysis shows that the real difference between the two approaches does not concern the general setting , i.e. geometric action vs. standard sources approach , but it lies in the process of regularization .",
    "indeed , as remarked in section [ geometriczzreg ] , adopting the zz regulator in the perturbative expansion of the geometric action , we have obtained the same results of the standard approach , even if the @xmath262 contributions to the quantum conformal dimensions have different formal origins within the two approaches .",
