    "magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) is an important spectroscopic observable useful for characterizing the electronic structure of molecules @xcite and condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "the theory of the mcd response is usually given as a third - order perturbation in a basis that diagonalizes the zero - field hamiltonian .",

    "the calculated matrix elements are automatically gauge - invariant and one also avoids the inconsistencies that cause sum rules to be violated .",
    "we mention that the real - time tddft has been applied to many observables related to electron dynamics @xcite .",
    "specific applications include the molecular absorption spectrum in the continuum @xcite , hyperpolarizabilities @xcite , the dielectric function @xcite , and chiral dichroism @xcite .",

    "finally , we have not discussed here the sensitivity to specific density functionals .",
    "although not reported , we have also carried out the c@xmath2 calculations with the lb94 functional @xcite .",
    "this gave very similar results except for rydberg transitions , which are considerably shifted in energy , depending on the functional .",
    "since the observables in mcd depend on currents , it might also be interesting to investigate the generalized tddft including current - current interactions .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation under grant phy-0835543 and by the doe grant under grant de - fg02 - 00er41132 .",
    "computations for @xmath125 were carried out at the t2k supercomputer , university of tsukuba , and at the supercomputer of institute of solid state physics , university of tokyo .",
    "in this appendix we apply the real - time theory to a simple hamiltonian , a spinless electron in an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the model is completely solvable making it useful in checking the coding and formulas for the tddft in a magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is taken as h_0 = p^22 m + 12 _ ^3 m _",
    "^2 r_^2 we label the eigenstates of @xmath8 by the number of excitation quanta along each coordinate axis , @xmath126 , and we set @xmath127 in the equations below .",
    "we take the oscillator frequencies @xmath128 to be nondegenerate , so the mcd response will only have @xmath1-type contributions .",
    "we first need the eigenstates in the presence of the magnetic field , expanded to first order in the field strength . taking the magnetic field in the @xmath129-direction ,",
    "the relevant perturbed orbitals are |000,b_z=      to get the real - time response @xmath60 , we multiply the ground state wave function by the field @xmath132 and expand over the eigenstates , to first order in @xmath51 .",
    "the required matrix elements of the dipole operator between ground and excited states are 100,b_z | _ x | 000 , b_z=(2 _ x)^-1/2",
    "@xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 the initial perturbed wave function is [ initial ] |_ky(t=0)= | 000 , b_z+ik(2_y)^1/2| 010 , b_z+ _ b b_z k(2 _ x)^1/2(_x^2-_y^2 ) |100 , b_z .",
    "the time dependence is put in by multipling the excited states by @xmath136 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath137 may then be evaluated as a function of time .",
    "the result after some simplification is [ rt - ho ] s^(z)_xy = 2 k _ b b_z",
    "_ x^2-_y^2 ( _ x t -_y t ) . the short - time response given by eq . ( 27 ) may be verified by making a power series expansion of the cosine functions in eq .",
    "( [ rt - ho ] ) . finally , the evaluation of @xmath138 by eq .",
    "( 20 ) may be verified by carrying out the cosine fourier transform , @xmath139 .",
    "putting in all three magnetic moment directions , the result is r_mcd = -131_b b _ ( e- _ )",
    "2_^2-_^2 it may be easily verified that @xmath138 satisfies the two sum rules , eq .",
