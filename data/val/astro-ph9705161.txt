    "bl  lacertae objects are compact radio sources that show clear manifestations of nonthermal activity : power law energy distributions , and rapid flux and polarization variability .",
    "rapid flux variability , one of the defining characteristics of bl  lac objects , is due to the changes in observed luminosity of the synchrotron emission produced from the bright unresolved source that dominates the observed emission from the core ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) . believed to be generated in a `` jet '' of relativistic material viewed nearly along the jet axis ( blandford & rees 1978 ) , the synchrotron radiation greatly complicates efforts to observe the nearby environment of bl  lacs .",
    "much current research on bl  lac objects focuses on the properties of the active nucleus across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "there has also been interest in the host galaxies and environments of bl  lacs ( e.g. falomo 1996 ; wurtz et al .",
    "a goal of direct observations of bl  lac host galaxies and companions is a better understanding of the conditions necessary for the generation of the bl  lac phenomenon , specifically the role that galaxy - galaxy interactions might play in triggering and maintaining the activity in bl  lacs .",
    "the largest ground based optical survey of bl  lac hosts to date is that of wurtz , stocke , & yee ( 1996 , hereafter wsy ) , with 50 objects imaged .",
    "a host is resolved in over 90% of the objects , and based on radial profiles , at least 70% ( possibly as high as 90% ) show elliptical type host galaxies , with no more than 12% showing exponential disk or spiral type hosts .",
    "studies using the higher resolution available to the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) have also begun , with advantages for seeing the host galaxy close to the nucleus , and for detecting close companions .",
    "falomo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have presented results on three objects ; two have elliptical hosts and one does not show a resolved underlying host to faint limits .",
    "the optical variability of the well known bl  lacertae object oj  287 , at @xmath12 , has been monitored from the ground more extensively than any other bl  lac object ( see , for example , sillanp et  al .",
    "also known as @xmath13 , oj  287 has extremely variable total and polarized flux , reaching very high degrees of observed optical polarization ( angel & stockman 1980 ) .",
    "the @xmath14-band brightness varies between @xmath15 and @xmath16 over time scales of years with smaller fluctuations on smaller timescales ( gonzales - perez , kidger , & de diego 1996 ) .",
    "the observed colors of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are relatively constant despite the observed variability ( efimov & shakovsky 1996 ) .",
    "recently bentez et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter b96 ) obtained deep ground - based optical and ir images of oj  287 and reported extended nebulosity , possible spatial coincidence between extended optical and radio emission , and a candidate optical `` jet '' ( of substantial angular and physical size ) at a position angle of 220@xmath5 .",
    "this putative optical jet does not coincide with the position angle of the vlbi radio jet ( @xmath19 ) , which is inclined at only 15@xmath5 to the line of sight and is responsible for the apparent superluminal motion of the compact radio source ( gabuzda & cawthorne 1996 ; vicente , chalot , & sol 1996 ) .",
    "the existence of an additional optical jet would be surprising because of the expectation that in oj  287 we have a highly foreshortened view of the ejection axis ; dual radio and optical jets would also be unprecedented in any agn .",
    "oj  287 is notable among the relatively modest numbers of bl  lac objects : it is among the brightest , the most luminous , the most compact ( at radio wavelengths ) , and the most rapidly variable in the sky .",
    "it is a clear candidate for high resolution space - based studies since its bright point source flux makes an underlying host galaxy difficult to resolve from the ground based observations as light imaged from the wings of the point source scatters into the host image . in this paper",
    "we present the first _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) wfpc-2 images of the oj  287 field and discuss what can be learned about the host galaxy and environment of oj  287 .",
    "the _ hst _ images include two 500 s , two 400 s , and two 30 s wfpc-2 exposures of the target obtained 24 march 1996 .",
    "only results from the central pc ccd ( @xmath20 from the bl  lac nucleus , corresponding to 51 @xmath21 kpc at z=0.306 ) are presented here .",
    "the four long exposures were cosmic ray cleaned in pairs using the technique described in yanny et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and averaged for an effective total exposure time of 1800 s. at the time of the exposures , oj  287 was near the bright end of its previously observed range of @xmath0-band magnitudes , ( @xmath22 ) , and all long exposures were saturated by a factor of 20 in the core out to a radius of 4 pixels ( 017 at the scale of the pc ccd ) .",
    "a combined image is presented in figure  1 .",
    "notation for the objects detected near oj  287 follows and extends the nomenclature of b96 .",
    "the faint horizontal band running across the center of the image is an artifact due to heavy saturation in the center of oj  287 affecting the gain of the wfpc-2 pc ccd readout electronics ( biretta , ritchies , & rudloff 1995 ) .",
    "availability of an accurate point spread function ( psf ) model is essential to good subtraction of the oj  287 point source , and it allows statements to be made about residuals .",
    "the inner psf of wfpc-2 is relatively stable with time .",
    "the optics of the _ hst _ are well known and a psf can be constructed theoretically .",
    "software to do this exists and is called `` tiny tim '' ( krist 1996 ) .",
    "this psf is relatively accurate out to radii of @xmath235 .",
    "further out , variable scattered light within the _ hst _ is impossible to model theoretically and can only be modeled empirically .    in figure  2a",
    "we show a tiny tim model wfpc-2 pc psf .",
    "archival _ hst _ images of stars may also be used as psfs and are often found to be preferable when dealing with a very bright or saturated point source .",
    "the difficulty lies in obtaining sufficient signal - to - noise in the wings while not saturating the core .",
    "a single observed psf can not be used to simultaneously fit the intensity of the core and model the faint wings of the image .",
    "a psf constructed from a combination of long and short exposures provides a better model .",
    "since the psf varies substantially with filter , with intrinsic color of the point source , and with position on the ccd over scales of 100 pixels or less , it has thus far been impractical to build up a good library of psf observations for the entire wfpc-2 camera field in all filter combinations .",
    "an extensive search of the _ hst _ archive yielded the wfpc-2 pc archival psf shown in figure  2b .",
    "this psf is located somewhat off - center of the pc chip , and has been cosmic ray cleaned .",
    "it has excellent signal - to - noise in the wings .",
    "it is saturated to @xmath24 pixels in the core and can only be used to subtract wing light from the oj  287 point source .",
    "we have subtracted both the theoretical and the empirical ( archival ) psfs from oj  287 .",
    "the results were compared in detail , and while the two residual images agree qualitatively , the theoretical psf is a better match .",
    "the quantitative estimates which follow were derived from a subtraction of the psf shown in figure  2a . the residual image after subtraction of the theoretical psf",
    "is presented in figure  3 , with the same orientation as figure  1 .",
    "the exact amount by which a model psf must be scaled to match the light in oj  287 is the key quantity .",
    "we were able to use light from the unsaturated pixels beyond the core pixels to determine a relative scaling for the psf .",
    "additionally , non - azimuthally symmetric extended emission allows us to judge an appropriate scaling by searching for a scaling of the model psf which results in a smooth , but not over - subtracted , residual .",
    "the centering of the psf is accurate to better than 004 , as experiments which shift the model psf by that amount and subtract result in a noticeably poorer fit .",
    "figure  3 shows an apparent excess of light extending over several arcseconds to the nw of oj  287 and sw of object e , which we believe is related to oj  287 , possibly an oj  287 host galaxy .",
    "this light is not centered on oj  287 .",
    "it is difficult to accurately estimate the difference in centroids between the point source .",
    "however , based on the fact that there is a great deal more extended light to the nw of oj  287 than to the se , we estimate that the difference in centroids is 04 or 1.2@xmath25 kpc at @xmath12 , the redshift of oj  287 calculated from emission lines ( sitko & junkkarinen 1985 ) .",
    "several checks have been performed attempting to confirm that this off - center light is not an artifact .",
    "both empirical and artificial model psf light was subtracted from strongly saturated stars obtained from the _ hst _ image library in order to determine if residual light due to the optics of _ hst _ could account for off - center diffuse light such as that seen in figure  3 . while some highly saturated stars did show non - azimuthally symmetric scattered light due to the _ hst _ optics , none of the scattered light was in the specific orientation or of an amplitude which approached the level of the nebulosity seen in figure  3 .",
    "small centering shifts of 0.5 to 2 pixels in the position of the subtracted psf have no effect on the presence or flux of the residual light seen on scales of 20 to 50 pixels nw of the bl  lac . also , subtraction of",
    "the same scaled psf from a bright field star in a similar _ hst _ image shows no extended residual ( jannuzi et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the available evidence indicates that the observed nw extension of the faint radiation around oj  287 is not produced by any telescope or instrument problem , and in fact confirms an earlier suggestion by wsy of decentered nebulosity .",
    "figure  4 of wsy suggests a 01 separation between the point source centroid position and point@xmath26extended source centroid .",
    "given their ground based resolution , this is consistent with our 04 measurement of separation between point source centroid and extended source ( alone ) centroid .",
    "additionally , the orientation of the extended light , significantly to the w of oj  287 , shows that it is not light scattered from object e ,",
    "3@xmath8 n of oj  287 ( this point was also noted by wsy ) .",
    "there is a small knot - like object ( oj@xmath27sw ) 25 sw of oj  287 , indicated by arrows in figure  3 .",
    "this feature is also not an artifact of the psf subtraction .",
    "there is known radio emission coincident with object oj@xmath27sw , but the radio emission extends for 8 - 10@xmath8 to the w of oj  287 , much further out than we detect optical emission .",
    "we find no clear evidence for an extremely faint optical source located @xmath28 w of oj  287 at @xmath2925 in figure  3 .",
    "this source would correspond to the source noted in the deconvolved image of b96 and corresponds in position to the radio emission seen in kollgaard et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and perlman & stocke ( 1994 ) .",
    "the position angle of the radio `` jet '' to the west , at p.a .",
    "265@xmath5 , agrees with the p.a .",
    "of the parsec scale jet resolved in vlbi observations ( gabuzda and cawthorne 1996 ) .",
    "we note that the ground based image of b96 appears to reach detection limits about one magnitude fainter than the present _ hst _ image , and the object was at the limit of detection in their combined raw image .",
    "deeper optical imaging followup is clearly needed .",
    "the _ hst _ image shown here does not show evidence for an extended `` jet '' at a position angle of 220@xmath5 as suggested in b96 . while from the ground the objects a , b , and c , ( and i and j ) appear nearly co - linear with oj  287 , in fact , they are clearly not co - linear when viewed at the resolution of _",
    "hst_. surface brightness limits on binned continuum @xmath0-band light between a ,",
    "b , c , i , and j are placed at sb(@xmath0 ) @xmath30 , nearly as faint as the levels reached at lower resolution from the ground in b96 .",
    "our surface brightness limits on the lack of connecting emission between oj  287 and objects at b and c are inferred from a @xmath31 pixel binned version of the _ hst _ image , in which no hint of an optical jet is seen .",
    "there is a second distinct object located 1@xmath8 sw of object e identified as object oj - gh .",
    "the position of this ringed feature on the wfpc-2 ccd image and its similarity to known ghost images of bright sources in the wfpc-2 _ hst _ optics make it suspect ( biretta , ritchies , & rudloff 1995 ) .",
    "we believe this object to be a ghost image of oj  287 due to reflections in the _ hst _ wfpc-2 optics , and do not consider it further .    in table  1",
    "we present positions , kron - cousins @xmath0-band magnitudes , an extent indicator , and ellipticities for objects in the oj  287 field .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitudes listed in table  1 are sky - subtracted aperture magnitudes calculated according to the formula given in the wfpc-2 photometry cookbook ( whitmore 1996 ) .",
    "the radius of the aperture is 10 pixels for small objects , and 150 pixels for oj  287 itself , where 1 pixel = 0044 .",
    "since only one filter is available , color corrections between f814w and the @xmath0-band may introduce errors of up to 0.1 magnitudes in the photometry .",
    "the difference @xmath32 is set to @xmath271.2 mags , a typical value for objects of reddish color as defined in whitmore ( 1996 ) .",
    "we calculate upper and lower limits on the brightness of the extended emission underlying oj  287 and to the nw as follows : for a sample of several psf subtractions ( both model psfs and taken from the _ hst _ archive ) of badly saturated objects ( images of bright isolated stars again taken from the _ hst _ archive ) , there can be residual light left of order about 10% of the total light of the original object , while the wings appear adequately subtracted .",
    "this 10% maximal residual light can also be seen in the oj  287 image after minimal psf subtraction by either the model or empirical psf .",
    "this places an upper limit on the brightness of an oj  287 host galaxy at @xmath33 15.8 .",
    "we can place a stronger upper limit on the brightness by noting the azimuthally symmetric properties of the residual light . estimating this contribution by studying the residual light of saturated stars , the upper bound for the brightness of the host galaxy is @xmath29 17.0 .",
    "to determine a lower limit , we note the residual light to the nw of oj  287 .",
    "this light has a surface brightness of about 0.25 dn pixel@xmath3 ( sb(@xmath0 ) = 21.3 mag arcsec@xmath7 ) above background compared with a patch of sky se of oj  287 and diametrically opposite of the excess seen to the nw .",
    "this excess , if spread uniformly over the area of sky that encompasses the entire area underneath the obliterated oj  287 residual , yields a flux corresponding to @xmath34 18.6 . for reasonable assumptions about color ,",
    "this surface brightness is well within the range of host galaxy surface brightnesses listed in wsy .",
    "if there is no light directly underneath oj  287 , the measured diffuse light has an integrated magnitude @xmath35 .    for @xmath36 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3",
    ", these magnitudes correspond to host galaxies in the absolute magnitude range from @xmath37 , where @xmath38-band is the rest wavelength spectral region probed by @xmath0-band light at z=0.306 .",
    "our favored estimate for the extended light surrounding oj  287 is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .    for comparison , wsy estimate from the ground , when the variable point source bl  lac was one magnitude fainter , that the magnitude of the oj  287 host is @xmath41 in the gunn system .",
    "there are a total of 6 extended source objects within @xmath422 ( @xmath4330 h@xmath44 kpc ) of the bl  lac .",
    "it is possible that object e is closely associated with the bl  lac , and several of the extended objects such as f and g have extents and magnitudes consistent with galaxies at the same redshift as oj  287 .",
    "however , we note that based on the hubble deep field galaxy counts ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , the number of galaxies expected with @xmath45 in a circular patch of radius 22@xmath8 is @xmath46 , consistent with the number of neighbors observed here within 10@xmath8 , allowing for a clustering correlation enhancement .",
    "although this shows there is not compelling statistical evidence for believing that any of these galaxies are physical companions , the objects ( oj  287 , oj - ext , oj - sw , a , e , f and g ) are suggestive of an interacting group of objects spread over an extent 50 h@xmath44 kpc . the unresolved objects b and c are likely to be galactic field stars of type k or m , based on their multicolor photometry from b96 .",
    "wurtz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find no evidence for a rich cluster surrounding oj  287 .",
    "it is interesting to note the positional coincidences in radio emission contours seen in the 6 cm map of kollgaard et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and resolved sources a , f and g in figure  3 .",
    "it is not known if these sources are physically associated with oj  287 at z=0.306 .",
    "obtaining redshifts for these objects will decide the issue , though the redshift of the diffuse faint object g with i=23.3 , will be difficult to obtain .",
    "there is a clear decentering ( by at least 04 to the nw ) of the point source from the main body of extended emission surrounding the bl  lac .",
    "the observed decentering is consistent with what might be expected for on - going interaction or merger activity between an object containing oj  287 s gaseous fuel supply and the decentered galaxy nw of oj  287 .",
    "hernquist ( 1989 ) demonstrates how a merger or close interaction can cause a rapid clumping of the gas supply of a galaxy to serve as fuel for an active nucleus .",
    "interaction - induced activity is particularly attractive in the case of oj  287 , because a binary black hole model can account not only for the optical flux periodicity ( lehto & valtonen 1996 ) , but also the vlbi radio morphology ( vicente , charlot , & sol 1996 ) . a merger or interaction scenario feeding gas to an active core appears more likely than a gravitational microlensing explanation for the high variability and decentered host galaxy of oj  287 .",
    "microlensing scenarios have difficulty achieving the observed `` variability duty cycle '' : the low optical depth of foreground lenses ( typically @xmath47 ) , leads to duty cycles where a lensed bl  lac would go through rapid 30% brightness variability episodes due to microlensing only once or twice per year as clusters of stars in a foreground galaxy pass in front of the bl  lac core along the line of sight ( treves et al .",
    "oj  287 varies much more frequently with much higher amplitude brightness variations than predicted by straightforward microlensing scenarios .",
    "if interactions are common and direct a gas supply to feed a bl  lac central engine ( although we note that an external gas reservoir by no means guarantees nuclear activity ) , then more decenterings or additional nuclei near bl  lacs are predicted . the fraction of objects with observable decenterings may only be a few percent , however , if the interacting objects rapidly merge on a dynamical timescale .",
    "we see no ` second nucleus ' near oj  287 , though several kpc around the point source are unobservable due to the brightness of the bl  lac .",
    "falomo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and jannuzi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) each investigated three bl  lac host galaxies with the high resolution of _ hst _ , and rule out decentering in five objects to levels of 005 .",
    "no extended emission was detected for the sixth object ( falomo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "there are only a few cases of bl  lacs with confirmed optical jets at large angles to the line of sight .",
    "the best known case is that of pks0521@xmath2736 ( macchetto et al .",
    "1977 ) . in the present case of oj  287 ,",
    "objects b and c in figure  1 are not co - linear with objects a and oj  287 and are in fact likely to be galactic stars rather than knots in a 100 kpc long optical jet ( b96 ) .",
    "the evidence that oj  287 belongs to the class of rare bl  lacs with optical jets is still weak .",
    "deeper images are necessary to confirm the claim of b96 of an optical counterpart to the radio emission 8@xmath8 west of oj  287 .",
    "our best estimate for the absolute magnitude of the off - center host galaxy is @xmath40 , while it could be as bright as @xmath48 .",
    "the radio flux at 20 cm from the extended source is log @xmath49 = 23.3 w hz@xmath3 ( perlman & stocke 1994 ) .",
    "oj  287 s observed optical and radio emission places it in the fr  i region of a radio - optical flux diagram , with properties similar to many other known bl  lac hosts .",
    "significant progress has been made in the study of the host galaxies and environments of bl  lac objects with ground - based observations ( wsy ; falomo 1996 ) .",
    "however , these studies have necessarily focused on the nearest objects and have not been able to resolve their inner regions .",
    "_ hst _ observations presented here show the bl  lac oj  287 to be interesting in several respects :    * either the oj  287 host galaxy is decentered by at least @xmath50 kpc from oj  287 itself , or there is an interacting companion galaxy to an unseen oj  287 host located at small projected separation from oj  287 . *",
    "the off - center nebulosity has an elliptical shape , absolute magnitude in the @xmath0 ( redshifted @xmath38 ) band of @xmath51 , and a surface brightness at one effective radius of sb(@xmath0 ) = 21.3 mag arcsec@xmath7 , consistent with many known fr  i type galaxies . *",
    "though oj  287 is not in a rich cluster , a number of companion objects are in close proximity to oj  287 , some of which may be physical companions and three of which correspond with continuum radio emission seen near oj  287 . * _ hst _ imaging does not strengthen the case for an optical jet at p.a .",
    "220 degrees .",
    "the apparent alignment of objects in ground - based images disappears when the field is observed with _ hst _ resolution and there is no evidence of extended emission linking the distinct objects . the apparent alignment of sources appears to be the result of a chance coincidence of galactic and extragalactic objects .",
    "deeper high spatial resolution @xmath38 and @xmath0-band images of oj  287 are needed to search for optical counter parts to the radio emission seen 8 - 10@xmath8 west of oj  287 .",
    "spectroscopy of objects a , e , f , and g is needed to test the hypothesis that there is a merging group spread over the 50 @xmath25 kpc surrounding oj  287 and potentially supplying fuel to the agn .",
