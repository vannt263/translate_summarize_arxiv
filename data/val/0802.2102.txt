    "modern cosmology has advanced considerably in recent years due to precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure @xcite .",

    "in addition , significant information about individual galaxies and quasars out to @xmath7 has been obtained through the efforts of many telescopes at multiple wavelengths @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , our knowledge and understanding of the evolution of most of the baryonic matter , which resided in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , is limited .",
    "constraints from wmap3 @xcite on the optical depth to the cmb ( @xmath8 ) only weakly constrain the redshift of reionization .",

    "low frequency observations of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen present one of the most promising avenues for exploring the entirety of the poorly constrained period between recombination and reionization @xcite .",
    "additionally , mapping hydrogen throughout this period and at lower redshifts raises the prospect of measuring primordial density fluctuations over a much larger volume than that probed by the cmb or galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "several experiments are currently being constructed ( such as mwa , lofar , paper , dbacker / eor/ ] 21cmapast/ ] ) and more ambitious designs are being planned ( ska ) to detect the theoretically - predicted 21 cm signal .",
    "the volume to be mapped can be loosely divided into three parts : _ ( i ) _ the _ `` dark ages '' _ between the epoch of cosmic recombination and the appearance of the first galaxies ( @xmath12 ) ; _ ( ii ) _ the epoch of reionization ( eor ) during which hydrogen was ionized by the uv radiation from galaxies ( @xmath13 ) ; and _ ( iii ) _ the post - reionization epoch ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the transition between the first two epochs , characterized by the appearance of the first luminous sources , is a period of  cosmic twilight \" , during which the radiation fields of the sources begins to affect the gas , heating and exciting the largely neutral inter - galactic medium ( igm ) . eventually , the small ionized regions surrounding groups of sources expand and percolate beginning the process of reionization .",
    "after reionization , the residual neutral hydrogen is found in dense clumps ( such as damped ly@xmath1 systems @xcite ) , self - shielded from ionizing radiation .",
    "precise measurements of the power - spectrum of 21 cm brightness fluctuations could constrain the initial conditions from inflation @xcite ( including deviations from scale - invariance or gaussianity ) , as well as the nature of the dark matter ( including a measurement of the neutrino mass in the range expected from atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite ) and dark energy @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm fluctuations are expected to simply trace the primordial power - spectrum of matter density perturbations either before the first galaxies had formed ( @xmath2 ) @xcite or after reionization ( @xmath14 )  when only dense pockets of self - shielded hydrogen survive @xcite . during the epoch of reionization ,",
    "the fluctuations are mainly shaped by the topology of ionized regions @xcite , and thus depend on astrophysical details . nevertheless , even during this epoch , the line - of - sight anisotropy of the 21 cm power spectrum due to peculiar velocities , can in principle",
    "be used to separate the implications for fundamental physics from the unknown details of the astrophysics @xcite .",
    "recent work has explored the 21 cm signal that may arise during reionization @xcite from variations in the ly@xmath1 flux @xcite , x - ray heating @xcite , gas density @xcite or peculiar velocities @xcite .",
    "in addition , the post - reionization signal has been explored by @xcite . in general , previous studies have focused on individual regions of parameter space where only one of two of these fluctuations needs to be considered and the rest are assumed to be negligible . here",
    "we attempt for the first time to present a global picture of the redshift evolution of the 21 cm signal , including all relevant fluctuations .",
    "the full history can be used to select particular redshift ( frequency ) windows and observing strategies within which fundamental physics would be optimally constrained .    in analyzing the full history of 21 cm fluctuations ,",
    "we seek to address two main issues .",
    "first , we would like to identify the redshift at which the presence of astrophysical sources begin to modify the pristine cosmological signal .",
    "this defines the minimum redshift that must be accessible for a future observatory aiming to detect directly the pristine signal ( in analogy with cmb experiments ) .",
    "although the answer is model - dependent , we will show that the rapidity with which structures form once non - linear collapse gets underway means that the model dependence is weak .",
    "the weak dependence we find is generic to a gaussian random field of initial density perturbations , as expected from inflation , for which the fraction of mass incorporated in collapsed objects grows exponentially ( on the high - density tail of the gaussian ) at early times .",
    "second , we wish to address the possibility of using the angular separation proposed by @xcite to recover cosmological information from 21 cm observations after astrophysical effects become large .",
    "we will show that there exists a window in redshift where this technique might be used to extract the dark - matter power spectrum despite the complication of other sources of fluctuations .",
    "finally , we would like to identify the primary astrophysical parameters that control the 21 cm signal at subsequent epochs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : theory ] we discuss the calculation of the 21 cm signal , attempting to bring together a variety of different sources of fluctuations .",
    "the results of these calculations are illustrated in ",
    "[ sec : results ] . in ",
    "[ sec : observation ] , we discuss the experimental requirements for detecting the 21 cm signal and explore the performance of three fiducial experiments . finally , we conclude in  [ sec : conclude ] and discuss future prospects .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , consistent with the latest measurements @xcite .",
    "we begin by briefly summarizing the physics of the 21 cm signal and refer the interested reader to @xcite for further details .",
    "the 21 cm line of the hydrogen atom results from hyperfine splitting of the @xmath22 ground state due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the proton and the electron . the hi spin temperature @xmath23 is defined through the ratio between the number densities of hydrogen atoms in the @xmath22 triplet and @xmath22 singlet levels , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ratio of the spin degeneracy factors of the two levels , and @xmath26 .",
    "the optical depth of this transition is small at all relevant redshifts , yielding brightness temperature fluctuations @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the neutral fraction of hydrogen , @xmath29 is the fractional overdensity in baryons , and the factor of @xmath30 arises from including the effect of peculiar velocities and averaging the signal over angles .",
    "the spin temperature is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the color temperature of the ly@xmath1 radiation field at the ly@xmath1 frequency and is closely coupled to @xmath33 by recoil during repeated scattering , and @xmath34 are the coupling coefficients to atomic collisions and ly@xmath1 photons , respectively .",
    "the spin temperature becomes strongly coupled to the gas temperature when @xmath35 .",
    "the collisional coupling coefficient is given by @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath38 is tabulated as a function of @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40 is taken from ref . @xcite .",
    "for a more detailed analysis of the collisional coupling , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the wouthysen - field effect @xcite coupling is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the oscillator strength of the ly@xmath1 transition .",
    "@xmath43 is a correction factor of order unity , which describes the detailed structure of the photon distribution in the neighborhood of the ly@xmath1 resonance @xcite .",
    "we make use of the approximation for @xmath43 outlined in ref .",
    "for the models considered in this paper , ly@xmath1 coupling dominates over collisional coupling at redshifts @xmath44 , although we consider this more carefully later .",
    "fluctuations in the 21 cm signal may be expanded to linear order @xcite @xmath45 where each @xmath46 describes the fractional variation in the quantity @xmath47 and we include fluctuations in the baryon density ( b ) , neutral fraction ( x ) , ly@xmath1 coupling coefficient ( @xmath1 ) , gas temperature ( t ) , and line - of - sight peculiar velocity gradient ( v ) .",
    "the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath48 it is important to realise that since fluctuations in @xmath49 can be of order unity , an expansion to second order becomes necessary near to the end of reionization .",
    "this leads to quartic terms contributing to the power spectrum .    noting that in fourier space @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the angle between the line of sight and the wavevector @xmath52 of the fourier mode , we may use equation to form the power spectrum @xmath53 here we note that all quartic terms must be quadratic in @xmath49 and separate them depending upon whether they contain powers of @xmath54 or not .",
    "those that contain powers of @xmath54 will not be isotropic and so contribute to the angular dependence of @xmath55 ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "we may rewrite eq . in more compact form @xmath56 where we have grouped those quartic terms with anomalous @xmath51 dependence into the term @xmath57 . in principle",
    ", high precision measurements of the 3d power spectrum will allow the separation of @xmath58 into these four terms by their angular dependence on powers of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath57 term , with its more complicated angular dependence , threatens this decomposition @xcite .",
    "since this term is only important during the final stages of reionization , we will ignore it in this paper noting only that the angular decomposition by powers of @xmath59 may not be possible when ionization fluctuations are important .",
    "it is unclear whether the first generation of 21 cm experiments will be able to achieve the high signal - to - noise required for this separation @xcite .",
    "instead , they might measure the angle averaged quantity @xmath60 ( where we neglect the @xmath57 term ) . in presenting our results ,",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath61 , which is easiest to observe and discuss the angular separation separately in  [ ssec : decomposition ] . we will typically plot the power per logarithmic interval @xmath62^{1/2}$ ] .      before calculating the evolution of the fluctuations , we must first provide an astrophysical model for the sources of radiation that modify the 21 cm signal .",
    "we follow the model of @xcite with some minor modifications .",
    "we must specify a luminosity and spectrum for sources of ionizing photons , lyman series photons , and x - rays .",
    "the variation in spectra has relatively little effect on the fluctuations ( but see refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite for further discussion on this point ) , so that for our purposes we will fix the spectrum and consider models with different luminosities .",
    "we specify three key parameters for our astrophysical sources : the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon in stars that contribute to ionizing the igm @xmath63 , the number of ly@xmath1 photons produced per baryon in stars @xmath64 , and the energy in x - rays produced per baryon in stars @xmath65 . with this parametrization",
    ", we are separating the physics of the sources from the star formation history , as the quantity of physical relevance will be the above numbers multiplied by the efficiency of star formation @xmath66 .",
    "for example , the conventional definition of the ionizing efficiency @xmath67 , gives the important quantity when tracking reionization .",
    "for convenience , we further define @xmath68 and @xmath69 via @xmath70 and @xmath71 where we take the reference values appropriate for normal ( so - called , _ population ii _ ) stars @xmath72 and for starburst galaxies with a power - law spectrum of index @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we use the spectra appropriate for these sources throughout . for comparison , in this notation ,",
    "the very massive ( _ population iii _ ) stars have @xcite , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , when the contribution from higher lyman series photons is included .",
    "we expect the value of @xmath68 to be close to unity .",
    "in contrast , @xmath69 is relatively unconstrained with values @xmath77 possible without violating the wmap cmb optical depth constraints .",
    "constraining this parameter will mark a step forward in our understanding of the thermal history of the igm and the population of x - ray sources at high redshifts .",
    "once reionization is complete we assume that photo - ionization heats the gas to @xmath78 .",
    "this is needed only for determining the thermal cutoff scale for the baryonic fluctuations for the post - reionization 21 cm signal .",
    "the focus of this paper is to combine different sources of 21 cm fluctuation into a complete picture of the evolution of the 21 cm signal from the epoch when the cosmic gas thermally decoupled from the cmb ( @xmath79 ) to the present time . in calculating the various sources of fluctuations",
    ", we draw heavily upon the existing literature . below",
    "we briefly discuss the relevant calculations and then describe how we piece them together .",
    "the 21 cm signal has been most extensively studied within the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , where it is most accessible to observations . during this epoch large - scale ( mpc )",
    "ionized ( hii ) regions grow around clusters of sources and delineate a density contrast of order unity in the hydrogen abundance , far greater than the underlying fluctuations in the matter density on the same scales @xcite .",
    "analytic models of the hii bubble size and resulting 21 cm correlations were formulated by @xcite , who considered bubbles to self - ionize once they contained a sufficient mass fraction in galaxies ( ionizing sources ) .",
    "this basic formalism has been applied to numerical simulations @xcite for more detailed calculations of the ionization power spectrum .",
    "complementary simulations by @xcite have been compared directly to the @xcite model showing reasonable agreement @xcite . for computational ease",
    ", we choose to use the fully analytic calculation of @xcite for the ionization fluctuations , including a correction for an error in the bubble bias as noted by @xcite .",
    "this prescription allows us to calculate @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the key parameter in the @xcite model is the ionizing efficiency of sources @xmath82 ; we extract this redshift - dependent quantity from our astrophysical model by relating the ionized fraction @xmath83 to the total collapse fraction @xmath84 through @xmath85 .",
    "fluctuations in the ly@xmath1 coupling originate from spatial variation of the ly@xmath1 flux , which arise primarily due to the strong clustering of early sources .",
    "the calculation of these fluctuations has been discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider fluctuations from ly@xmath1 photons arising from both stellar and x - ray sources @xcite , which have different scale dependence .",
    "we follow the model of @xcite in calculating @xmath86 by integrating the flux from all sources weighted appropriately by distance and in addition account for higher lyman series photons @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have shown that including the scattering of ly@xmath1 photons in the igm near to sources redistributes the ly@xmath1 flux leading to greater power on large scales @xcite .",
    "we neglect this effect estimating that this would change our results at the @xmath87 level when ly@xmath1 fluctuations dominate .",
    "temperature fluctuations arise initially through the competition between adiabatic cooling and compton scattering on the cmb ( which drives the gas towards being isothermal ) . after thermal decoupling at @xmath88 ,",
    "the former process dominates and temperature fluctuations grow since the rate of cooling is density dependent .",
    "once star - formation begins , x - ray heating drives large temperature variation due to its highly inhomogeneous nature .",
    "we calculate the evolution of temperature fluctuations using the formalism of @xcite including all three processes .",
    "temperature fluctuations may also arise as a result of exotic heating mechanisms such as the decay of dark matter @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in producing a  standard \" picture of the 21 cm signal and will leave exotic deviations to future work .    before star - formation",
    ", 21 cm fluctuations are determined by simple atomic physics and so , potentially , provide a window into the physics of inflation , via precise measurements of the spectrum of density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical work @xcite has shown this period to be rich in physics as recombination , thermal coupling , gas pressure and other physical processes interact to determine the final 21 cm signal .",
    "since compton drag on the cmb distinguishes between baryons and dark matter , detailed calculation must track the evolution of both components separately @xcite .",
    "after thermal decoupling , however , baryons fall into the potential wells created by the dark matter and by @xmath89 it is a good approximation to take the baryons as tracking the dark matter , although this ignores the presence of acoustic oscillations in the baryon component and pressure smoothing on small scales .",
    "baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) represent a major target for galaxy surveys and 21 cm observations since they help to constrain dark energy via the angular - diameter - distance redshift relation @xcite .",
    "21 cm observations of baryon oscillations complement galaxy surveys well @xcite , since they cover a higher redshift range and have a different set of biases than galaxy surveys which may be affected by inhomogeneous galaxy formation @xcite .    in our calculations , we assume that baryons trace the underlying density field on large scales but are smoothed by the finite pressure of the gas on small scales @xcite so that @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the filtering scale @xcite .",
    "thermal broadening introduces a second smoothing scale @xmath93 @xcite , which we incorporate through a gaussian cutoff factor , @xmath94 .",
    "until x - ray heating becomes important @xmath95 , while afterwards @xmath96 as the filter mass takes a finite period of time to respond to the greatly increased gas temperature .",
    "these smoothing scales are small ( typically @xmath97 ) until photoionization heats the gas to @xmath98 and smoothing becomes important for wavenumbers @xmath99 .",
    "we calculate linear density fluctuations using the fitting function of @xcite .",
    "non - linear density effects become important even at high redshift and we incorporate these using the halo model @xcite .",
    "after reionization is complete , a few percent of all neutral hydrogen ( by mass ) remain in over dense clumps that are self - shielded ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "these clumps are observed as high - column density absorbers in quasar spectra in the form of lyman - limit or damped ly@xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness from this post - reionization epoch will trace the density fluctuations with a nearly constant bias @xcite .",
    "following the calculations of @xcite , we take the post - reionization signal to be @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "although the fluctuations here are much weaker than before reionization , the vastly diminished foreground at the appropriate higher frequencies makes observations feasible .",
    "observation of fluctuations in this regime may be used to detect baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum and constrain the equation of state of the dark energy at higher redshifts than those accessible to supernova or galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the existence of numerous cross - terms in eq . connecting different fluctuations requires some thought . following the approach of @xcite",
    ", we relate @xmath86 to the baryon density field using a scale - dependent linear function @xmath103 .",
    "similarly we set @xmath104 @xcite . in this way , we are able to relate the cross - terms @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and equivalent @xmath108 terms to @xmath109",
    ". since the ly@xmath1 flux , gas temperature , and baryon density do not interact directly with one another these cross - terms should be a good approximation .",
    "the treatment of the neutral fraction fluctuations is more complicated .",
    "once hii bubbles begin to form , we are faced with a two phase medium composed of almost fully ionized hii regions and the largely neutral igm outside .",
    "we must distinguish between @xmath83 , the fraction of the cosmic gas incorporated in fully ionized bubbles , and @xmath110 the ionized fraction in the largely neutral igm ( which could be increased beyond its primordial value due to diffuse x - rays ) .",
    "neutral fraction fluctuations arise from both , although in most models that we consider @xmath110 remains small at all times and so fluctuations in @xmath110 are also small .",
    "the calculations of @xmath86 and @xmath111 by @xcite and @xcite assume that the filling fraction of hii regions is negligible .",
    "however , here we must relax that assumption in order to calculate terms like @xmath112 .",
    "since there is essentially no 21 cm signal from the ionized hii regions , the hii regions act to mask the fluctuations in @xmath1 and t. overdense regions will host sources of ly@xmath1 and x - ray photons , as well as ionizing photons , suggesting that cross - terms of the form @xmath112 and @xmath113 may be complicated .",
    "we show later that these cross - terms are subdominant , so that , for a first approximation , we may neglect these complications and model the cross - terms as @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and so on .",
    "detailed calculation will require numerical simulation of the ionization and radiation fields to determine the cross - terms .",

    "the evolution of @xmath139 clearly shows three regimes : the post - reionization regime at low redshifts ( @xmath140 ) where the 21 cm fluctuations from residual hydrogen follow the matter power spectrum , an intermediate redshift regime ( @xmath141 ) where ly@xmath1 coupling produces a large signal and complicated astrophysics leads to significant scale dependence , and a high redshift collisionally - coupled regime where 21 cm fluctuations track the density field ( @xmath142 ) . for pedagogical purposes ,",

    "thermal decoupling at @xmath144 is a gradual process and , initially , @xmath139 grows due to a combination of the growth of density fluctuations and the steady gas cooling below @xmath145 .",
    "as the gas rarifies and cools , collisional coupling becomes less effective and , at @xmath146 , @xmath139 begins to decrease in amplitude .",
    "note that the continuing growth of structure offsets the turnover on @xmath139 from the minimum of @xmath131 , seen in figure [ fig : tempzlong ] to occur at @xmath147 . as collisional coupling diminishes , the signal drops towards zero .",

    "before the signal drops all the way to zero , significant star - formation occurs and the resultant ly@xmath1 production leads to the beginning of ly@xmath1 coupling by @xmath130 .",
    "the exponential increase in the global star formation rate at these redshifts is responsible for the rapid increase in @xmath131 and @xmath139 . with this rise in signal ,",
    "we enter into a regime dominated by astrophysics and begin to see complicated scale dependence .    initially , ly@xmath1 fluctuations boost the signal somewhat above the level of density fluctuations alone",
    ". however , x - ray heating follows not far behind and contributes to @xmath139 with the opposite sign ( hotter regions produce a weaker absorption signal , see @xcite ) . in this competition ,",
    "x - ray driven temperature fluctuations dominate causing @xmath139 to pass through a zero point ( seen as a sharp dip at @xmath151 in all three plots ) .",

    "we note based on figure [ fig : tempzlong ] that the brightness fluctuations emitted @xmath131 are generically smaller than they were during the absorption regime , leading to a decreasing trend in @xmath139 .",
    "as reionization gets underway , ionization initially causes @xmath139 to drop leading to a pronounced dip in its evolution .",
    "this occurs as a result of the clustering of ionizing sources in over dense regions causing the ionized hii regions to  mask out \" those dense regions that have been producing the strongest 21 cm signal . as reionization proceeds ,",
    "the contrast between ionized and neutral regions comes to dominate and @xmath139 , rises until @xmath154 after which the contrast begins to drop .    towards the end of reionization",
    "the signal drops sharply as very little gas is left neutral .",
    "the post - reionization signal grows slowly as the density field grows . since by this time the gas is photo - heated to @xmath155 the thermal width of the 21 cm line is sufficient to smooth out the signal on wavenumbers @xmath99 .",
    "this cutoff potentially acts as a thermometer of the gas after reionization giving information about the temperature of gas contained in dense clumps .    as a result of the interplay between the radiation fields ,",

    "observational prospects for the angular separation are best when these fluctuations are small , at the beginning of the emission period but before reionization is well advanced ( @xmath282 for model a ) . there is also a possibility for measuring @xmath181 during the absorption period ( @xmath283 for model a ) although this relies somewhat upon the scale - dependent cancellation between temperature and ly@xmath1 fluctuations .",

    "since the ska and la experiments are essentially sample variance limited at @xmath143 , it would seem that performing the full angular separation will be exceedingly difficult except in a few redshift windows .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the isotropic part of the power spectrum dominating the uncertainty in measurement of the @xmath59 and @xmath178 terms . to improve on the results illustrated here",
    "it would be necessary to beat down cosmic - variance by observing multiple fields on the sky . since the variance scales as @xmath284 while the contribution from thermal noise scales as @xmath285 , there is a trade - off involved in splitting observing time into different fields .",
    "the experiment will gain sensitivity on scales to which it is sample variance limited while losing sensitivity where thermal noise is important . only if the experiment has sufficient instantaneous sensitivity , will it be worth observing multiple fields .",
