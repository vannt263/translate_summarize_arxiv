    "the dynamics of a point particle moving within a closed region ( billiard ) with oscillating walls provide a mathematical model for studying the phenomenon of fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "such systems typically produce an increase in the particle s kinetic energy and much effort is devoted to quantify this phenomenon .",
    "it has been shown that collisions with periodically oscillating walls of an ergodic chaotic billiard accelerate the particle so that on average its energy grows linearly with the number of collisions and quadratically as a function of time @xcite .",
    "in particular , this behaviour is observed in a periodically oscillating dispersive billiard @xcite and in a stadium with oscillating base @xcite .",
    "examples of such billiards are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "it was discovered in @xcite that if the ergodicity of the frozen billiard is violated , i.e. the shape of the billiard is changed in such a way that several ergodic components are created during a part of the billiard oscillation cycle , then the average energy growth is much faster , typically exponential in time .",
    "a bunimovich mushroom deformed so as there exists particle exchange between its integrable and chaotic components corresponds to such multi - component , exponential accelerator @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c .",
    "the mushroom is a special case of a large class of billiards with mixed phase space where chaotic zones coexist with stability islands ; the exponential character of acceleration at a periodic perturbation of such systems was established in @xcite .",
    "the multi - component accelerators can also be created by pseudo - integrability @xcite and by division of the billiard configuration space into disjoint pieces @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b .",
    "one of the primary applications of the fermi acceleration model is in plasma physics where it is used to study the heating of charged particles due to electromagnetic waves @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the electrons absorb energy from the wave in the plasma sheath , deposit it in the plasma bulk and return back to the sheath .",
    "thus , the system is not closed and allows for entry and exit of particles .",
    "leaky chaotic systems also emerge in numerous physical situations such as chemical reactions , optical microcavities @xcite and hydrodynamic flows ( see recent review and references therein @xcite ) .    stationary leaky billiards have been extensively studied .",
    "it was shown that the escape rate through holes in the billiard boundary depends sensitively on the hole position , size and billiard properties @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider time - dependent leaky billiards and provide estimates for energy gain for the two above mentioned classes of the accelerators : ergodic ( like in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a , c ) and multi - component ( figs . [ fig : fig1]b , d ) .",
    "we consider the small hole size limit and observe that @xmath0 , the averaged number of collisions a particle spends in the leaky accelerator , is inversely proportional to the hole size for both cases .",
    "then we demonstrate that for the ergodic case the averaged energy gain per particle grows linearly with @xmath0 whereas in the multi - component case the averaged energy gain is much larger and is approximated by a quadratic polynomial in @xmath0 , see eqs .",

    "consider an accelerator which interacts with an ideal gas by exchange of particles through a small hole ( or a few small holes ) on its boundary .",
    "we assume that the gas is at equilibrium , i.e. there is a stationary distribution of the particles speed and the distribution of the angles at which the particles move in the gas is uniform .",
    "we assume that the particles move much faster than the billiard boundary .",
    "collisions with the moving billiard walls change the kinetic energy of the particles inside the billiard , and , on average , this may lead to an outgoing energy gain .    for a fixed kinetic energy @xmath7",
    "( we assume the particles have a unit mass ) , the number density of particles entering the billiard per unit of time is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the size of the hole ( the area of the hole for the three - dimensional case ) .",
    "thus , the incoming energy flow at energy @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that inside the billiard the particles do not collide / interact with each other , so we can consider each of them separately .",
    "this gives us the net energy production by the accelerator per unit of time : @xmath11,\\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the averaged value of the kinetic energy at the moment of exit for a particle that enters the accelerator with the energy @xmath9 ( we average over all possible initial angles and positions in the hole , as well as over the phase of the billiard oscillations at the entry moment ) .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the probability to exit the accelerator after @xmath14 collisions with the billiards walls and @xmath15 be the corresponding averaged exit energy .",
    "then @xmath16 we assume that the hole size @xmath4 is small enough , so the effect of the hole on the statistics of the billiard is negligibly small ( as in the case of the stationary lorentz gas @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we assume that @xmath17 can be approximated by the averaged energy of a particle in the closed ( i.e. non - leaky ) accelerator after @xmath14 collisions .",
    "additionally , we assume that @xmath13 and , thus , @xmath0 , the averaged number of collisions before exit , do not dependent on @xmath9 nor on the wall velocity @xmath18 .",
    "this is obviously true when the billiard walls are stationary , so we extrapolate this claim to the case of slowly moving boundaries .",
    "we confirm this claim numerically for the examples we consider here ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the numerics show that @xmath13 can be well approximated by the geometric distribution @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c ) .",
    "the average value @xmath0 in this setting is just a geometric characteristic of the billiard and the hole .",
    "the natural assumption is @xmath20 where @xmath4 is the size of the hole in the billiard boundary , @xmath21 is the size of the entire billiard boundary , @xmath22 is the volume occupied by the billiard , and @xmath23 is the characteristic diameter of the billiard .",
    "relations are confirmed by numerical experiments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a ) .    to find the net energy production ,",
    "it remains to estimate the dependence of the averaged energy @xmath24 of a particle in the closed accelerator on the number of collisions @xmath14 .",
    "let us recall how energy is gained in the accelerators .",
    "the reflection law for a particle hitting a moving wall is obtained by going to a coordinate frame that moves with the same velocity as the wall at the moment of collision . in the moving",
    "coordinates , we have an elastic reflection law which , after returning to the stationary frame , results in the reflection law @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the normal velocity of the wall at the collision point @xmath27 at the moment @xmath28 ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the velocities before and after the collision , and the subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the components of the velocity which are normal and , resp . , parallel to the wall .",
    "if the billiard is chaotic , then the correlations between the consecutive angles @xmath33 at which the particle hits the wall decay fast .",
    "therefore , the process described by eq . may be approximated by a random walk with reflections : at each collision the particle velocity undergoes a reflection and acquires an increment at a random direction .",
    "this random walk proceeds differently for the two main classes of accelerators , ergodic and multi - component @xcite . in the ergodic case",
    "the random walk becomes unbiased in the large speed limit , which means that the square of velocity ( i.e. the kinetic energy ) grows linearly with the number of collisions .",
    "indeed , by taking the square of eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflection ] ) , the energy @xmath34 after the @xmath14-th collision satisfies @xmath35 since @xmath36 , the change in the billiard shape and relative change in the energy are not significant for a large number of consecutive collisions , so one can average eq . over the ergodic measure in the @xmath37-space . the second term in eq .",
    "can be much larger than the third one , but one can check ( see e.g. @xcite ) that after averaging over the ergodic measure and over the period of the billiard oscillation , the second term vanishes ( this is a consequence of the existence of the so - called anosov - kasuga adiabatic invariant in the ergodic case , see @xcite ) .",
    "corrections to the averaging due to a slow change in the billiard shape and energy were computed in @xcite .",
    "it follows from @xcite that , after the averaging , the @xmath38-term in eq .",
    "effectively acquires a small factor of order @xmath39 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the effective change of the averaged energy per collision is of order @xmath40 ( i.e. it is a certain portion of the kinetic energy of the wall ) .",
    "it follows that in the ergodic case the averaged energy of a particle grows as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the averaged wall speed ( average of @xmath43 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eout]),([5 ] ) ) that in the small hole limit @xmath44 for some coefficient @xmath45 that may depend on the billiard shape and on the details of the protocol of the billiard wall oscillations . by plugging this result into eq .",
    ", we obtain that the energy gain rate in the ergodic case is positive , independent of the hole size @xmath4 , and is given by @xmath46 i.e. it is proportional to the kinetic energy of the billiard wall , to the volume of the billiard , and inverse proportional to the time @xmath47 the gas particle with the speed @xmath3 needs to traverse the billiard once .",
    "next , we investigate the case of a multi - component accelerator . in this case",
    "the ergodicity of the fast motion is broken , so the @xmath38 term in eq .",
    "( [ enrc ] ) does not average out .",
    "this means that the random walk ( [ eq : reflection ] ) in the velocity space acquires a non - vanishing bias , so the particle speed is linear in @xmath14 and its energy is quadratic in @xmath14 .",
    "a more precise description of this process is done based on the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "we note that the time between two consecutive collisions tends to zero as the particle speed grows , @xmath48 and it follows from eq .",
    "( [ enrc ] ) that @xmath49 , i.e. in the non - ergodic case the energy changes exponentially with time , with a certain random rate . on a longer time",
    "scale this process can be modeled by a multiplicative random walk ( see @xcite ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the kinetic energy after @xmath52 periods of the billiard oscillations , and @xmath53 is the sequence of independent , identically distributed random variables , independent of the initial energy .",
    "importantly , it is shown in @xcite that this random walk can not be decelerating and , typically ,",
    "@xmath54    if we ignore details of particle behavior on the time scales below the period @xmath55 of billiard oscillations , we can infer from eq . the following description for the behavior of the averaged energy and speed gain at time @xmath28 : @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "note that the number of collisions up to time @xmath28 can be related to the particle speed via @xmath59 .",
    "so , the averaged number of collisions up to time @xmath28 is given by @xmath60 ( see eq .",

    ", we need to relate the rate @xmath68 with @xmath69 , the kinetic energy of the wall .    by eq .",
    "the exponential growth rate @xmath68 is always non - negative .",
    "the minimal value @xmath70 is achieved when the distribution of particles in the billiard remains uniform during the period of billiard oscillations , like in the case of ergodic billiard .",
    "hence , when the deviation from the ergodic behavior is small , the rate @xmath68 is small and behaves like the square of a certain quantitative measure of this deviation .",
    "the violation of ergodicity in the exponential accelerator is caused by changes of the phase space structure of the frozen billiard as its shape changes with time .",
    "therefore , we relate the deviation from ergodicity to the magnitude of the shape change over the period . as the billiard size",
    "is changed with the mean speed @xmath42 , the dimensionless parameter estimating the ergodicity violation is @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the rate of the energy increase over the period @xmath55 is , at small @xmath42 , given by @xmath72 one can also extract this relation from the formulas for @xmath68 for various cases of multi - component accelerators ( e.g. from @xcite ) .",
    "notice that even when @xmath42 is not small , the ratio @xmath73 remains bounded and so does @xmath74 ( we assume everywhere that the typical length scale of the billiard does not change hugely along the cycle ; otherwise pathological behaviors may arise ) .",
    "so , eq . can be used in this case as well ; it would then simply mean that the quantities on both side of the relation are of order @xmath63 .    plugging eq .",
    "( [ muutl ] ) into eq .  , we find @xmath75 , \\label{eq : egainmc}\\ ] ] or , in the case @xmath76 , @xmath77 , \\label{eq : egainmc1}\\ ] ] where the new coefficients @xmath62 depend on the shape of the billiard and the protocol of the wall oscillation .",
    "the term @xmath78 is proportional to the number of collisions per period . in our",
    "setting this number is assumed to be large .",
    "it is also important for the validity of the exponential growth model that the particle is initially fast ( i.e. @xmath79 ) yet it remains in the billiard at least for one period",
    ". therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : egainmc0 ] ) , ( [ eq : egainmc ] ) , and ( [ eq : egainmc1 ] ) are valid under the assumption @xmath80 in particular @xmath81 .",
    "when this condition is violated , our theory is not applicable .    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : egainmc ] ) , ( [ eq : egainmc1 ] ) with eq .",
    "we see that the energy gain in the multi - component accelerator is much larger than in the ergodic case .",
    "even if the exponential growth rate @xmath68 is very small , the coefficient of @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : egainmc ] ) is large whereas the corresponding coefficient in eq .   is simply a constant . with the increase of @xmath68",
    "the quadratic in @xmath83 term becomes dominant in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : egainmc ] ) , ( [ eq : egainmc1 ] ) and provides the main contribution to the energy gain .",

    "there are two distinct predicted dependencies of the energy gain on the hole size and on @xmath87 for the two types of leaky accelerators . to examine these predictions",

    "notice that each component of the frozen billiards is ergodic and mixing @xcite .",

    "however , the bias is much smaller in the ergodic case , confirming our conjecture that it is of order @xmath4 .",
    "the dependence of the energy gain on @xmath42 appears to be a more delicate numerical issue and will be further investigated elsewhere .",
    "a priory , a faster accelerator does not automatically imply higher energy gain as faster particles escape earlier from the accelerator and the net energy gain reflects the balance between the averaged escape time and the energy gained by then . in this paper",
    "we find that in a billiard the escape is mainly determined by the average number of collisions , and from this observation we are able to find the balance between these two factors for two different types of accelerators .",
    "our results conclusively show that multi - component leaky accelerators produce higher net energy flow than their ergodic counterparts .",
    "moreover , we show that the difference increases significantly when the hole size decreases .",
    "one may worry that decreasing the hole size will lead to very long residence times .",
    "however , for the multi - component case the residence time increases only logarithmically with the hole size .",
    "indeed , the number of collisions is related to the residence time via @xmath59 , hence , in the multi - component case the averaged residence time is proportional to @xmath122 , while in the ergodic case it is proportional to @xmath123 .",
