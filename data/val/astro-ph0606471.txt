    "star formation in such an environment is thought to be assisted by some external trigger , and the filamentary clouds themselves have probably been created by large - scale motions of the interstellar gas .",

    "oksh@xmath126 was , however , born apparently before the collision .",
    "the weak - line t  tauri stars to the west of the cloud complex make the pattern of star formation of this region even more complicated .",
    "they indicate a prolonged star formation in the region .",
    "the age distribution of the wttss suggests star formation propagating from lower to higher galactic longitudes .",
    "more accurate age determinations and more detailed mapping of molecular velocity distribution are needed to clarify the picture .",
