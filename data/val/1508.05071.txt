    "accordingly , it appears sensible to compare the rheology of very dense colloidal suspensions to that of other visco - elastic liquids . in particular",
    ", one may wonder why a variety of complex fluids among the latter , such as worm - like micelles or polymer solutions @xcite , are prone to a ( non - inertial ) flow instability in curved geometry , leading for instance to the formation of vortices , while , to the best of our knowledge , no such visco - elastic instability has ever been reported in very dense colloidal suspensions .",
    "the level of difficulty required to rationalise the rheology of suspensions strongly depends on the volume fraction @xmath0 of interest . in the dilute regime ,",
    "the fluid is newtonian ; its viscosity is independent of the applied shear rate .",
    "more quantitatively , the linear corrections to the solvent viscosity due to the colloids were worked out by einstein a little more than a century ago , under the assumption of non - interacting colloids @xcite . by a detailed study of the probability distribution function of particle pairs ,",
    "the approach was extended to interacting colloids by batchelor and others @xcite , and led to a description of the semi - dilute regime @xcite . for @xmath4 ,",
    "collective effects become paramount , in that glassiness can be thought of as the entrapment of particles in the `` cages '' formed by their neighbours ; these effects turn a first - principles derivation of the macroscopic rheology into a formidable challenge , all the more so as the presence of flow distorts the structure of the material away from its `` quiescent configuration '' and gives rise to complex interplays @xcite .    nevertheless , at the expense of some uncontrolled approximations , the mode - coupling theory developed by sjgren , bengtzelius , gtze , sjolander , and others @xcite succeeded in rationalising the phenomenology of the glass transition by focusing on the evolution and the relaxation of the ( slow ) density modes of the system and on their coupling to the other ( faster ) variables .",

    "however , the derivation hinges on the assumption of a perfectly homogeneous flow throughout space ; this hampers the investigation of any flow instability .",
    "indeed , perturbations , which break homogeneity , are not handled adequately ; in particular , the mechanism describing their ( expected ) advection with the flow is still missing in the equations .",

    "this will come at the expense of very strong ( but explicitly exposed ) approximations and clearly undermine the accuracy of the description .",
    "nevertheless , the ensuing simple model , which falls in the white - metzner class @xcite , will allow us to capture the experimentally measured low - shear - rate rheology and high - shear - rate rheology in a model colloidal glass - forming dispersion @xcite .",

    "figures  [ fig : s_star_st_vs_alpha]-[fig : colourmaps_maxgr ] show that , for the model parameters corresponding to the colloidal suspension at @xmath346 , but with vanishing newtonian viscosity , the base flow lies deep within the stable region , whereas , in the absence of shear - thinning , _ i.e. _ , were @xmath248 vanishingly small , a linear instability would develop , with a peak of instability around @xmath347 , @xmath348 .",
    "we should however mention the existence of a limited range of values of @xmath248 , _ outside _ the experimentally relevant window for dense colloidal suspensions , namely , @xmath349 and marked by red vertical bars on fig .",
    "[ fig : s_star_st_vs_alpha ] , which display unstable modes associated to _ abnormally large growth rates_. these modes are located in a very different region of the @xmath350-plane , namely @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "although these perturbations have reasonable shapes in space , it is plausible that they are actually unphysical , but we do not know whether they are intrinsic in our wm - model or whether they arise because of artifacts in the ( well established ) numerical method . in the following , we concentrate on the experimentally relevant range of parameters .",
    "dependence of the maximal growth rate @xmath325 on the shear - thinning parameter @xmath248 , for @xmath353 , @xmath343 , @xmath344 .",
    "the arrow points to the typical values of @xmath248 of interest here . see the text for the description of the red vertical bars.,width=264 ]      we now specifically consider the model parameters used to fit the rheology of dense colloidal suspensions , ( see table  [ tab : model - parameters ] ) .",
    "consistently with the strongly stabilising effect of shear - thinning described in the previous section ( section  [ sub : stabilisation - through - shear - thin ] ) , we have numerically ascertained the stability of the base flows corresponding to the suspension at @xmath354 for rescaled shear rates @xmath355 , at @xmath356 for @xmath357 in the experimental range , as well as that with effective volume fraction @xmath358 at @xmath359 .",
    "the relative contribution of the newtonian viscosity to the stabilisation of the flow echoes the contribution of the newtonian stress to the total stress : at high densities and low shear rates , the effect of the newtonian viscosity is negligible .",
    "admittedly , the more acute shear - thinning displayed by the wm models fitted to the densest suspensions results in an enhanced stability compared to the experimental systems ; however the fact that they lie so deep in the stable region suggests that the materials they model , albeit somewhat less shear - thinning , are also stable with respect to the considered perturbations .",
    "this is further supported by the observed stability of the system at @xmath354 , which is both less shear - thinning than the others and very well described by the wm model .",
    "before we conclude , it is interesting to note that the stabilising effects of shear - thinning and of the newtonian contribution are in line with the visco - elastic stability criterion proposed by pakdel and mckinley in 1996 @xcite ( less general versions of the criterion can be found in earlier publications @xcite ) . on the basis of a dimensional analysis of generic visco - elastic constitutive equations",
    ", these authors introduced a dimensionless number , written @xmath360 here , for inertialess visco - elastic instabilities in curved geometries in analogy to the classical taylor number for inertial instabilities , and propounded the idea that the base flow is susceptible to an instability if this dimensional number exceeds a given threshold of order unity .",
    "the pakdel - mckinley number reads @xmath361 where @xmath362 is the typical distance travelled by a material substructure ( _ e.g. _ , a polymer chain ) along the base - flow streamline while relaxing , @xmath363 is the radius of curvature of the streamline , @xmath364 is the first normal - stress - difference and @xmath365 is the shear stress . for a ucm model ,",
    "the ratio @xmath366 is simply the weissenberg number and measures the `` anisotropy of the normal forces '' , as phrased by morozov and van saarloos @xcite .",
    "but even with the present wm model , which is somewhat more complicated , the criterion based on @xmath360 seems to capture the observed trends : a newtonian contribution to the stress increases @xmath365 without altering @xmath364 , thereby reducing @xmath360 and stabilising the flow .",
    "on the other hand , an enhanced propensity to shear - thinning results in a decrease of @xmath364 as @xmath367 , while @xmath365 only decreases as @xmath368 ( for @xmath335 ) ; as a result , @xmath360 is reduced , which also explains the enhanced stability of the flow .    the newtonian stress contribution and the propensity to shear - thinning thus act in synergy , but , for the rheology of the very dense colloidal suspensions of interest here ,",
    "our results indicate that the impact of shear - thinning quantitatively prevails over that of the former .",
    "in conclusion , we have made use of , and partially extended , a general theoretical framework based on projections onto density modes , to describe the rheology of dense colloidal suspensions in the vicinity of the glass transition .",
    "contrary to the previous theoretical works , which focused on strictly homogeneous flows , special attention was paid to the fate of spatial inhomogeneities . however , the intricacy of the formalism forced us to resort to particularly strong approximations before we could study the stability of the flow in curved ( taylor - couette ) geometry . at the expense of these approximations , constitutive equations falling in the white - metzner class",
    "were obtained ; the resulting model was shown to capture the shear - thinning properties of the material and to be reasonably consistent with experimental measurements of the linear rheology and steady - state rheology of the suspensions , although not in a strictly quantitative way . eventually , we analysed the stability of the visco - elastic flow and brought evidence that , in the experimental range of shear rates , shear - thinning ( and to a _ much _ lesser extent the newtonian stress contribution ) strongly stabilise the flow .",
    "this may explain why visco - elastic instabilities have been observed in a variety of visco - elastic fluids , but not in the dense suspensions under consideration here : the flow strains and destroys the microstructure of the material , so much so that , if a material volume is displaced by a perturbation , the memory of the stress that it carries , through its microstructure , is suppressed by the flow too quickly to allow the possibility of a feedback mechanism .
