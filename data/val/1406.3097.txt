    "asteroseismology is a unique approach to investigate stellar properties , which is similar to helioseismology for the sun .",
    "this is a technique to see the stellar properties by using the observable information of stellar oscillations . via the observations of spectra of oscillation frequencies , one expects to find the stellar mass , radius , equation of state ( eos ) , spin frequency , and information about magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "the possibilities to constrain the saturation parameters of nuclear matter are also suggested , using the quasi - periodic oscillations observed in the giant flare phenomena @xcite , whose sources are considered as strongly magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the direct observations of gravitational waves induced by the stellar oscillations might enable us to probe the gravitational theory in strong - field regime @xcite .",
    "many experiments and observations in weak - field regime , such as the solar system , tell us the validity of general relativity , while the tests of gravitational theory in strong - field regime are still poor .",
    "that is , the gravitational theory in strong - field regime might be different from general relativity .",
    "if so , one could probe the gravitational theory through the observations associated with compact objects @xcite .",
    "verification of gravitational theory is one of the importances to directly detect the gravitational waves .",
    "eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity ( eibi ) @xcite recently attracts attention as a modified gravitational theory , because the big bang singularity can be avoided with this theory .",
    "eibi is based on the gravitational action proposed by eddington @xcite and on the nonlinear electrodynamics by born and infeld @xcite .",
    "eibi becomes completely equivalent to general relativity in vacuum , while eibi can deviate from general relativity in the presence of matter . because the gravity in eibi is nonlinearly coupled with matter",
    ", one can expect the significant deviation in the high density region , such as inside the compact objects .",
    "actually , the spherically symmetric neutron star models in eibi have been constructed , which can deviate from the predictions in general relativity even for the low - mass neutron stars @xcite .",
    "that is , via the direct measurements of stellar mass and radius , one might be able to distinguish eibi from general relativity .    on the other hand , as mentioned before , the frequencies of compact objects could tell us the information associated with the compact objects . if the spectra of stellar oscillations expected in eibi would become different from those in general relativity",
    ", one might be possible to distinguish the gravitational theory via the observation of stellar oscillations such as the gravitational waves radiated from the compact objects .",
    "so , in this paper , we consider the stellar oscillations in eibi .",
    "in particular , to examine the oscillation frequencies , we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation , where the metric is assumed to be fixed during the oscillations .",
    "then , as changing the coupling parameter in eibi and stellar models , we will examine the spectra systematically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly summarized eibi and equilibrium stellar models in eibi . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , we derive the perturbation equations describing the stellar oscillations and solve it numerically .",

    ", we adopt geometric units , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath8 .",
    "in this section , we briefly mention eibi and the relativistic stellar models in eibi , where we especially consider the spherically symmetric stellar models . eibi is proposed by baados and ferreira @xcite , which can be obtained with the action as @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the determinants of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while @xmath14 is the ricci tensor constructed with the connection @xmath15 .",
    "we remark again that the connection @xmath16 should be considered as the independent field from the metric tensor @xmath13 in eibi .",
    "the matter action @xmath17 depends on the metric and matter field @xmath18 .",
    "this theory has two parameter @xmath19 and @xmath0 .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath19 is associated with the cosmological constant @xmath20 , such as @xmath21 . in this paper , we consider only asymptotically flat solutions , i.e. , we adopt that @xmath22 .",
    "the remaining parameter @xmath0 is the eddington parameter , which is constrained in the context of the observations in solar system , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the existence of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "additionally , terrestrial measurements of the neutron skin thickness of @xmath23pb and astronomical observations of the radius of @xmath24 neutron star could enable us to constrain @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the field equations are obtained by varying the action @xcite ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote an auxiliary metric associated with the physical metric @xmath13 via eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and its determinant , while @xmath28 is energy - momentum tensor defined with the matter action @xmath17 as @xmath29 with the covariant derivative @xmath30 , which is defined with @xmath13 , the energy - momentum conservation law is expressed as @xmath31 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , one can show that the physical metric @xmath13 is completely equivalent to the auxiliary metric @xmath26 , when @xmath32 .",
    "the structures of neutron stars in eibi have been discussed in some literatures @xcite .",
    "the metric for the spherically symmetric objects is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath19 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are functions of @xmath38 . assuming that the neutron stars are composed of perfect fluid , the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy density and pressure , while @xmath42 corresponds to the four velocity of matter given as @xmath43 .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) , and the energy - momentum conservation law , one can obtain the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in eibi @xcite . to close the equation system",
    ", one needs prepare the relationship between the pressure and density , i.e. , eos .",
    "in particular , in this paper , we adopt two realistic eoss to construct the neutron star models , i.e , shen eos @xcite and fps eos @xcite .",
    "shen eos is based on the relativistic mean field approach , while fps eos is based on the skyrme - type effective interaction ( see @xcite for more details about the adopted eoss ) .",
    "note that the appearance of the curvature instabilities at the stellar surface constructed with a polytropic eos is pointed out @xcite , which could be a problem to solve .",
    "furthermore , the coupling constant @xmath0 is constrained from the evidence that compact objects exist @xcite , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the central pressure and density .",
    "hereafter , we adopt @xmath47 as a normalized coupling constant , where @xmath2 is the nuclear saturation density given by @xmath48 g @xmath49 .",
    "we remark that the coupling constant @xmath0 has been constrained from the observations in the solar system , i.e. , @xmath50 m@xmath51 s@xmath52 kg@xmath53 @xcite , which leads to @xmath54 .    .",
    "the shaded region surrounded by the broken line shows the allowed values of mass and radius for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss in general relativity , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines show those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] , we show the mass - radius relations in general relativity and in eibi with @xmath57 , where the shaded region surrounded by the broken line corresponds to the allowed region in mass - radius relation for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines correspond to those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from this figure , one can observe a large uncertainty in the mass - radius relation due to eos , compared with that due to the gravitational theory . in practice ,",
    "even if @xmath58 , it might be difficult to distinguish the gravitational theory by using the measurements of stellar mass and radius .",
    "in this paper , as mentioned before , we focus on the stellar oscillations of the relativistic stars in eibi . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the cowling approximation as a first step , i.e. , we neglect the metric perturbations as @xmath59 . the lagrangian displacement vector of matter element @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond to functions of @xmath64 and @xmath38 , while @xmath65 denotes the spherical harmonics . with such variables ,",
    "the perturbation of four - velocity @xmath66 can be expressed as @xmath67 where the dot denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "additionally , the perturbations of energy density and pressure are given by @xmath68    then , the perturbation equations in the cowling approximation can be derived from the variation of the energy - momentum conservation law , i.e. , @xmath69 . in practice , one can obtain the following equations ; @xmath70 = 0 , \\label{eq : a } \\\\",

    "in addition to the above equations , one can show that @xmath71 is associated with @xmath72 as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the sound speed .",
    "at last , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a ] )  ( [ eq : c ] ) with the relation of @xmath73 , one can get the perturbation equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath75w        + \\left[\\frac{\\omega^2}{c_s^2 } fe^{-\\nu } -   \\ell(\\ell+1)\\right]v , \\label{eq : a1 } \\\\    v ' = -\\frac{1}{f}e^{\\lambda}w + \\left[\\frac{2}{r } - \\frac{f'}{f } + \\nu'\\right]v .",
    "\\label{eq : a2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we assume that the perturbation variables have a harmonic time dependence , such as @xmath76 .    with the appropriate boundary conditions ,",
    "the problem to solve becomes the eigenvalue problem with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "the boundary condition at the stellar surface is that the lagrangian perturbation of pressure should be vanished , i.e. , @xmath78 , which reduces to @xmath79 on the other hand , the perturbation variables should be regular at the stellar center . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , one can show that @xmath62 and @xmath63 should behave in the vicinity of stellar center as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant .",
    "hereafter , we especially focus on the @xmath82 modes , which can be dominating modes in gravitational wave radiations from the compact objects .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from the observational point of view , as shown in fig .",

    "the shaded regions surrounded by the broken lines denote the frequencies expected for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss in general relativity , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines denote those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . comparing to the mass - radius relation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] , one can observe that the frequencies depend weakly on the eos .",
    "this could be because that the @xmath37 mode oscillation , which is an acoustic wave , propagates inside the star with sound velocity associated with the stellar average density .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested in general relativity that the @xmath37 mode frequencies are written as a linear function of the stellar average density , which weakly depends on the adopted eos @xcite . from the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : l2 ] , one can obviously see that the @xmath37 mode frequencies in eibi with @xmath84 could be distinguished from those in general relativity , even if the uncertainty in frequencies due to eos would exist .",
    "that is , via the direct observations of @xmath37 mode oscillations , one could distinguish eibi from general relativity , if @xmath1 , independently of eos for neutron star matter . of course ,",
    "if the eos for neutron star matter would be determined or constrained via the other astronomical observations and/or terrestrial unclear experiments , one might distinguish eibi even with @xmath4 from general relativity . on the other hand , with the uncertainty due to eos",
    ", it seems to be difficult to distinguish eibi with @xmath85 from general relativity via the observations of @xmath83 mode oscillations .",
    "eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity ( eibi ) attracts attention as a modified gravitational theory in the context of avoiding the big bang singularity .",
    "this theory completely agrees with general relativity in vacuum , but can deviate from general relativity in the region with matter . in this paper ,",
    "we especially forces on the stellar oscillations in eibi , and examine the oscillation frequencies of neutron stars as changing the eddington parameter @xmath0 . for this purpose",
    ", we derive the perturbation equations with relativistic cowling approximation by linearizing the energy - momentum conservation law . as a result",
    ", we find that the @xmath37 and @xmath83 mode frequencies depend strongly on the eddington parameter . compared with the expectations in general relativity ( @xmath86 ) , the frequencies in eibi with negative @xmath0 become high and those with positive @xmath0 become low .",
    "additionally , in general , there exists an uncertainty in stellar models due to eos of neutron star matter , but we show that one could identify eibi with @xmath1 from general relativity independently of the adopted eos .",
    "furthermore , one might be able to distinguish eibi even with @xmath4 from general relativity , if the eos would be constrained from the astronomical observations and/or terrestrial nuclear experiments . in this paper , although we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation as a first step , we will do more complex analysis for gravitational waves radiated from neutron stars in eibi without such approximation somewhere .",
    "in fact , the damping time of gravitational waves is also one of the important information from the asteroseismological point of view .",
