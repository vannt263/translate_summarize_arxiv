    "recent advances in computing and measurement technologies have led to an explosion in the amount of data with network structures in a variety of fields including social networks @xcite , communication networks @xcite , biological networks @xcite , disease transmission networks @xcite and so on .",
    "this creates an urgent need to understand the generative mechanism of these networks and to explore various characteristics of the network structures in a principled way .",
    "statistical models are useful tools to this end , since they can capture the regularities of network processes and variability of network configurations of interests , and help to understand the uncertainty associated with observed outcomes @xcite . at the same time , data with network structures pose new challenges for statistical inference , in particular asymptotic analysis when only one realized network is observed and one is often interested in the asymptotic phenomena with the growing size of the network @xcite .",
    "the in- and out - degrees of vertices ( or degrees for undirected networks ) preliminarily summarize the information contained in a network , and their distributions provide important insights for understanding the generative mechanism of networks . in the undirected case ,",
    "the degree sequence has been extensively studied @xcite . in particular , its distributions",
    "have been explored under the framework of the exponential family parameterized by the so - called `` potentials '' of vertices recently , for example , the `` @xmath0-model '' by @xcite for binary edges or `` maximum entropy models '' by @xcite for weighted edges in which the degree sequence is the exclusively sufficient statistic .",
    "it is also worth to note that the asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimates ( mles ) for these models have not been derived until very recently @xcite . in the directed case , how to construct and",
    "sample directed graphs with given in- and out - degree ( sometimes referred as `` bi - degree '' ) sequences have been studied @xcite . however , statistical inference is not available , especially for asymptotic analysis .",
    "the distributions of the bi - degrees were studied in @xcite through empirical examples for social networks , but the work lacked theoretical analysis . in this paper , we study the distribution of the bi - degree sequence when it is the sufficient statistic in a directed graph .",
    "recall the koopman  pitman ",
    "darmois theorem or the principle of maximum entropy @xcite , which states that the probability mass function of the bi - degree sequence must admit the form of the exponential family .",
    "we will characterize the exponential family distributions for the bi - degree sequence with three types of weighted edges ( binary , discrete and continuous ) and conduct the maximum likelihood inference .    in the model we study , one out - degree parameter and one in - degree parameter",
    "are needed for each vertex . as a result ,",
    "the total number of parameters is twice of the number of the vertices . as the size of the network increases , the number of parameters goes to infinity .",
    "this makes asymptotic inference very challenging .",
    "establishing the uniform consistency and asymptotic normality of the mle are the aims of this paper . to the best of our knowledge , it is the first time that such results are derived in directed exponential random graph models with weighted edges .",
    "we remark further that our proofs are highly nontrivial .",
    "one key feature of our proofs lies in approximating the inverse of the fisher information matrix by a simple matrix with small approximation errors .",
    "this approximation is utilized to derive a newton iterative algorithm with geometrically fast rate of convergence , which leads to the proof of uniform consistency , and it is also utilized to derive approximately explicit expressions of the estimators , which leads to the proof of asymptotic normality . furthermore , the approximate inverse makes the asymptotic variances of estimators explicit and concise .",
    "we note that @xcite have studied problems related to the present paper but the methods therein can not be applied to the model we study .",
    "this is explained in detail at the end of the next section after we state the main theorems .",
    "next , we formally describe the models considered in this paper .",
    "consider a directed graph @xmath1 on @xmath2 vertices labeled by @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the weight of the directed edge from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the set of all possible weight values , and @xmath8 be the adjacency matrix of @xmath1 .",
    "we consider three cases : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the first case is the usual binary edge .",
    "we assume that there are no self - loops , that is , @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the out - degree of vertex @xmath5 and @xmath14 be the out - degree sequence of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , define @xmath15 as the in - degree of vertex @xmath6 and @xmath16 as the in - degree sequence .",
    "the pair @xmath17 or @xmath18 are the bi - degree sequence",
    ". then the density or probability mass function on @xmath1 parameterized by exponential family distributions with respect to some canonical measure @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the log - partition function , @xmath22 is a parameter vector tied to the out - degree sequence , and @xmath23 is a parameter vector tied to the in - degree sequence .",
    "this model can be viewed as a directed version of the @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "it can also be represented as the log - linear model @xcite and the algorithm developed for the log - linear model can be used to compute the mle . as explained by @xcite , @xmath24 quantifies the effect of an outgoing edge from vertex @xmath5 and @xmath25 quantifies the effect of an incoming edge connecting to vertex @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath24 is large and positive , vertex @xmath5 will tend to have a relatively large out - degree .",
    "similarly , if @xmath25 is large and positive , vertex @xmath6 tends to have a relatively large in - degree . note that @xmath26\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & = & \\prod _ { i , j=1;i\\neq j}^n \\exp\\bigl((\\alpha_i+ \\beta_j ) a_{i , j } \\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that the @xmath27 random variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 are mutually independent and @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath30 since an out - edge from vertex @xmath5 pointing to @xmath6 is the in - edge of @xmath6 coming from @xmath5 , it is immediate that @xmath31 moreover , since the sample is just one realization of the random graph , the density or probability mass function ( [ eq : density : whole ] ) is also the likelihood function . note that if one transforms @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the likelihood does not change .",
    "therefore , for identifiability , constraints on @xmath34 or @xmath35 are necessary . in this paper , we choose to set @xmath36 .",
    "other constraints are also possible , for example , @xmath37 or @xmath38 . in total , there are @xmath39 independent parameters and the natural parameter space becomes @xmath40 note that model ( [ eq : density : whole ] ) can serve as the null model for hypothesis testing , for example , @xcite , or be used to reconstruct directed networks and make statistical inference in a situation in which only the bi - degree sequence is available due to privacy consideration @xcite . moreover , many complex directed network models reply on the bi - degree sequences , indirectly or directly .",
    "thus , model ( [ eq : density : whole ] ) can be used for preliminary analysis of network data for choosing suitable statistics in describing network configurations , for example , @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the above discussions only consider independent edges .",
    "exponential random graph models ( ergms ) , sometimes referred as exponential - family random graph models , for example , @xcite , can be more general . if dependent network configurations such as @xmath41-stars and triangles",
    "are included as sufficient statistics , then edges are not independent and such models incur `` near - degeneracy '' in the sense of @xcite , in which almost all realized graphs essentially either contain no edges or are complete @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that most realizations from many ergms look similar to the results of a simple erds  rnyi model , which implies that many distinct models have essentially the same mle , and it was also proved and characterized in @xcite the degeneracy observed in the ergm with the counts of edges and triangles as the exclusively sufficient statistics .",
    "further , by assuming a finite dimension of the parameter space , it was shown in @xcite that the mle is not consistent in the ergm when the sufficient statistics involve @xmath41-stars , triangles and motifs of @xmath41-nodes ( @xmath42 ) , while it is consistent when edges are dyadic independent . in view of the model degeneracy and problematic properties of estimators in the ergm for dependent network configurations , we choose not to consider dependent edges in this paper .    for the remainder of the paper , we proceed as follows . in section  [",
    "section : main ] , we first introduce notation and key technical propositions that will be used in the proofs .",
    "we establish asymptotic results in the cases of binary weights , continuous weights and discrete weights in sections  [ subsection : binary ] ,  [ subsection : continuous ] and  [ subsection : discrete ] , respectively .",
    "simulation studies are presented in section  [ section : simulation ] .",
    "we further discuss the results in section  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "since the technical proofs in sections  [ subsection : continuous ] and [ subsection : discrete ] are similar to those in section  [ subsection : binary ] , we show the proofs for the theorems in section  [ subsection : binary ] in the , while the proofs for sections  [ subsection : continuous ] and  [ subsection : discrete ] , as well as those for proposition  [ pro : inverse : appro ] , theorem  [ theorem : newton : converg ] and lemmas  [ lemma - binary-1 ] and  [ lemma - binary-2 ] in section  [ subsection : binary ] are relegated to the online supplementary material @xcite .",

    "further , our general results can also be applied to the poisson model where @xmath28 follows : @xmath352 in which the fisher information matrix is a constant matrix .",

    "however , simulation results in @xcite indicate that the mles still enjoy the properties of uniform consistency and asymptotic normality , in which the asymptotic variances of the mles are the corresponding diagonal elements of the inverse of the fisher information matrix . since the fisher information matrix for the parameter vector @xmath362 is the extension of that for @xmath363 with only a new row and a new column , by the sherman  morrison formula , we can also obtain an approximate inverse but with a relatively complex form .",

    "for example , the issue of testing the fit of the @xmath294 model has been discussed in several previous work , including @xcite , but mostly in heuristic ways . in view of the result in this paper that the mle enjoys good asymptotic properties in model ( [ eq : density : whole ] ) , the conjectures in the above references on the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test for testing the fit of @xmath294 model seem reasonable .",
