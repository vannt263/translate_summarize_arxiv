    "nonlinear physics of discrete systems has witnessed enormous development in the past years . in particular ,",
    "a great deal of interest has been paid to the existence and properties of intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , or discrete breathers , which result from the combination of nonlinearity and spatial discreteness .",
    "these spatially localized states have been observed in a wide variety of different systems @xcite .",
    "they were originally suggested as excitations of anharmonic nonlinear lattices @xcite , but the rigorous proof of their persistence under general conditions  @xcite led to their investigation in a diverse host of applications .",
    "these include , among others , antiferromagnets  @xcite , charge - transfer solids  @xcite , photonic crystals  @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions  @xcite , micromechanical cantilever arrays  @xcite , granular crystals  @xcite and biopolymers  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the direct manipulation and control of such states has been enabled through suitable experimental techniques @xcite .    despite the tremendous strides made in this field , the relevant literature",
    ", nevertheless , often appears to be quite sharply divided between theory and experiment .",
    "frequently , experimental studies do not capture the dynamics in enough detail to facilitate an exact comparison with theoretical studies . at other times , the theoretical models are not refined enough ( or lack the inclusion of nontrivial experimental factors some of which may be difficult to quantify precisely ) to make quantitative contact with the experimental results .",
    "our system a macroscopic electrical lattice in which solitons have a time - honored history  @xcite is , arguably , ideally suited for this kind of cross - comparison : the lattice dynamics can be measured fully in space and time , and the physical properties of individual unit cells of the lattice can be characterized in enough detail to allow for the construction of effective models .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of discrete breathers in an electric lattice in which ilms have been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "we propose a theoretical model which allows us to systematically study their existence , stability and properties , and to compare our numerical findings with experimental results .",
    "we demonstrate good agreement not only at a qualitative but also at a quantitative level between theory and experiment .",
    "the presentation of our results is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we study the characteristics ( intensity and capacitance curves versus voltage ) of the varactor , the nonlinear circuit element , in order to develop the relevant model for the electrical unit cell .",
    "the results for the single cell are validated through the comparison of its resonance curves for different driving strengths .",
    "we also derive the equations describing the entire electrical line . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numexp ] we study the existence and stability properties of @xmath0-peaked breathers for @xmath1 in the driving frequency and voltage parameter space .",
    "the numerical results are compared to the experimental data with good quantitative agreement .",
    "we also briefly study the spontaneous formation of @xmath0-peaked breathers from the modulational instability of the homogeneous steady state .",
    "we observe that the location and number of the final peaks depends sensitively on the initial conditions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] , we conclude our manuscript and offer some suggestions for possible avenues of further research .",
    "our system consists on an electric line as represented in fig .  [ line ] .",
    "this line can be considered as a set of single cells , each one composed of a varactor diode ( nte 618 ) and an inductor @xmath2  @xmath3h , coupled through inductors @xmath4  @xmath3h . each unit cell or node",
    "is driven via a resistor , @xmath5  k@xmath6 , by a sinusoidal voltage source @xmath7 with amplitude @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . in experiments a set of 32 elements have been used , with a periodic ring structure ( the last element is connected to the first one ) , and measurements of voltages @xmath10 have been recorded .",
    "related to the voltage source , we have considered amplitudes from @xmath11  v to @xmath12  v and frequencies from @xmath13  khz to @xmath14  khz .        ) and numerical approximation thereof ( continuous line ) corresponding to @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( linear and semi  log plots ) for the nonlinear varactor . ]    in order to propose a set of equations to characterize the electrical line , we have used circuit theory and kirchhoff s rules ; the main challenge has been to describe appropriately each element . in general , resistance and inductors",
    "are inherently imperfect impedance components , i.e. , they have series and parallel , reactive , capacitive and resistive elements . moreover , due to the commercial nature of the elements , manufactured components are subject to tolerance intervals , and the resultant small spatial inhomogeneity introduces some additional uncertainty .",
    "we have quantified the spatial inhomogeneity by separately measuring all lattice components .",
    "the diode capacitance was found to vary by 0.3 percent ( standard deviation ) , whereas the inductors both exhibited a 0.5 percent variation .",
    "additional factors that may contribute slightly to inhomogeneities are wire inductances as well as load and contact resistances .",
    "the varactors ( diodes ) we use are typically intended for am receiver electronics and tuning applications . as described later",
    ", we characterize this lattice element in more detail , since it is the source of the nonlinearity in the lattice .    as a guiding principle",
    ", we are aiming to construct a model which is as simple as possible , with a limited number of parameters whose values are experimentally supported , but one which is still able to reproduce the main phenomenon , namely nonlinear localization and the formation of discrete breathers . with this balance in mind , we proceed as follows .    in the range of frequencies",
    "studied it is a good approximation to describe the load resistance as a simple resistor , neglecting any capacitive or inductive contribution .",
    "also , we have performed experimental measures of the varactor characteristics .",
    "this experimental data shows that it can be modeled as a nonlinear resistance in parallel with a nonlinear capacitance , where the nonlinear current @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18  v@xmath19 and @xmath20 a ( we consider negative voltage when the varactor is in direct polarization ) , and its capacitance as @xmath21    c_0 e^{-\\alpha v } & \\mbox{if } \\quad v > v_{c } , \\end{matrix } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23  pf , @xmath24  v@xmath19 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( the capacitance and its first derivative are continuous in @xmath27 ) , @xmath28  nf and @xmath29  v. in fig .  [ expe ]",
    "we present the experimental data and their corresponding numerical approximations for @xmath16 and @xmath15 , where a good agreement between the two can be observed .    with respect to the inductors , in the range of frequencies considered ,",
    "capacitive effects are negligible , but they possess a small dc ohmic resistance which is around @xmath30 . the inductors and the varactor are a source of damping in the ac regime , and these contributions must be taken into account .",
    "however , we have no manufacturer data related to dissipation parameters , and it is difficult to measure them experimentally . in order to introduce these effects , we will model dissipation phenomenologically by means of a global term given by a resistance @xmath31 , which appears in each unit cell in parallel with @xmath32 ; to determine its value , we have studied experimentally a single element as shown in fig .",
    "[ single ] . in this way",
    ", we will consider the inductors themselves as ideal elements .        using basic circuit theory , the single element is described by the equations : @xmath33 , \\nonumber \\\\[2.0ex ]   \\frac{d y}{d \\tau } & = & -\\left(1+\\frac{l_2}{l_1}\\right ) v,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dimensionless variables have been used : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the dimensionless voltage at point @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ; @xmath41 represents the normalized current through the inductors .",
    "we can generate theoretical nonlinear resonance curves and , comparing with experimental data , select the optimal dissipation parameter value @xmath31 .",
    "results are summarized in table [ rl ] , and the comparison between theoretical and experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "[ ress ] . also , we consider a small frequency shift of @xmath42  khz in numerical simulations to match the resonance curves",
    ". this effect may originate from some small capacitive and/or inductive contributions that we have not previously taken into account .",
    ".values of the resistance @xmath31 corresponding to different voltage amplitudes for the driving source @xmath8 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     more detailed experimental results are shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] where we depict peak profiles at two different driver voltages .",
    "the profiles were taken at the times of largest peak voltage amplitude and lowest peak voltage amplitude . for @xmath43v (",
    "left column of panels ) we see that , as the frequency is raised from below , we cross from the 1-peak region through the 2-peak region and into the 3-peak region . for the @xmath44  v case ( right column of panels )",
    "the same sequence can be observed when scanning in one frequency direction . in order to illustrate both the hysteresis and the overlap between @xmath0-peak regions , we depict in the figure ( panels ( e ) and ( f ) ) a situation where the 2-peak solution occurs at a higher frequency than the 3-peaked one .",
    "the reason is that in fig .",
    "[ profiles](f ) , the 3-peak solution was obtained at higher frequencies and then adiabatically extended to lower ones , whereas in fig .",
    "[ profiles](e ) the 2-peak solution was obtained starting from the 1-peak region .",
    "we show the eventual location of peaks in the breather pattern ( i.e. after the driver has been on for a long time ) . however , it is important to mention that the exact location where the peaks eventually settle is sensitive to slight impurities in the lattice .",
    "we have noticed that when we turn on the voltage source , at first we can observe a more sinusoidal pattern ( corresponding to the most modulationally unstable @xmath45-value ) , but as the pattern reaches higher energy and becomes more nonlinear , the peaks may shift and adjust themselves in the lattice .",
    "as it can be observed , peaks are not perfectly equispaced in the lattice .",
    "this is obviously due to the inhomogeneities and noise present in the experiment .    for the numerical results depicted in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] we used a set of initials conditions based on the experimental data and determined the stationary state by letting the numerical profiles to settle to a steady state . for the cases corresponding to @xmath43",
    "v and @xmath44  v , adding a small frequency offset @xmath46  khz , we observe , in general , a good agreement between numerics and experimental data .",
    "the mismatch between experiments and theory , in particular the intersite distance peaks , can be attributed to the above mentioned factors .",
    "furthermore , to reproduce precisely the experimental peak voltage is extremely difficult because it corresponds to the voltage at resonance and , therefore , even very small parameter changes can create large differences in the maximum amplitudes .",
    "nevertheless , the quantitative agreement appears fairly good , especially for the @xmath44  v case .",
    "in this paper we have formulated a prototypical model that is able to describe the formation of nonlinear intrinsic localized modes ( or discrete breathers ) in an experimental electric line .",
    "this has been derived based on a combination of the fairly accurate characterization of a single element within the lattice ( including its nonlinear resonance curves and hysteretic behavior ) and fundamental circuit theory in order to properly couple the elements .",
    "comparison between theory and experiments shows very good qualitative and even good quantitative agreement between the two .",
    "we characterized the regions of existence and stability of @xmath0-peaked breathers for @xmath1 and illustrated how transitions of the coherent waveforms of one kind to those of another kind take place , rationalizing them on the basis of stability properties and their corresponding floquet spectra .",
    "we also showed that the precise number of peaks and their location in the lattice is fairly sensitive to initial conditions , a feature also generally observed in the experiments where the potential for states with different numbers of peaks similarly manifests .",
    "naturally , many directions of potential future research stem from the fundamental modeling and computation basis explored in the present manuscript . on the one hand , it would be very interesting to attempt to understand the stability properties of the different breather states from a more mathematical perspective , although this may admittedly prove a fairly difficult task .",
    "on the other hand , from the modeling and computation perspective in conjunction with experimental progress , the present work paves the way for potentially augmenting these systems into higher dimensional setups and attempting to realize discrete soliton as well as more complex discrete vortex states therein  @xcite .",
    "such studies will be deferred to future publications .",
