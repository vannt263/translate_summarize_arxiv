    "however , after the gas disk had been depleted , they found that planetary interactions with the remnant planetesimal disk tended to remove these systems from resonances and induce dynamical instability .",
    "it is in this context that we examine the role of the debris disk in affecting the stability of the hr 8799 system .",
    "first , we investigate if it is possible to delay the onset of instability for an initially highly unstable orbital configuration .",
    "then we consider a configuration with a long lifetime and determine whether a debris disk can cause instability .      as discussed in the introduction",
    ", initial solutions tested by @xcite had suggested that hr 8799b , c and d were most likely in 4:2:1 dual mean motion resonances .",
    "nearly all orbital configurations that remain stable during a reverse integration for the estimated age of the system which also agree with the observed orbital elements and nominal masses for the planets minimally called for hr 8799c and d to be in a 2:1 mmr .",
    "furthermore , the dual mean motion 4:2:1 resonance followed by the inner pair of hr 8799c and d in a 2:1 mmr allow for the largest possible range of masses that still produce simulations stable over the lifetime of the system .",
    "alternate solutions included a 2:1 mmr among the outer pair hr 8799b and c as well as a few finely tuned solutions . in a later analysis",
    ", @xcite found that when the three planet configuration is placed in the 4:2:1 mmr with low planet eccentricities , hr 8799 could survive the observed age of the system and potentially longer .",
    "re - reduction of hubble space telescope astrometric data of hr 8799 by @xcite , originally taken in 1998 , robustly supports the previous 4d:2c:1b dual mmr hypothesis with results which have only small departures from the exact integer period ratios in previously published data .",
    "this previous dynamical work precedes the discovery of the innermost planet hr 8799e by @xcite .",
    "however , simulations by @xcite have indicated that the extra planet only places more restrictions on the possible system architectures . in order for those simulations to remain stable over the minimum estimated lifetime of the hr 8799 system , the planets e , d and c are required to be in a 4:2:1 mmr along with masses on the minimum end of the estimated values .",
    "note that the 4:2:1 dual mean motion resonance is still the most likely configuration for this system to be in if long term stability is desired - the difference being which planets are in the mean motion resonance , their projected masses due to dynamical considerations , and the maximum age of the system which remains stable given these orbital elements .",
    "the total mass and distribution of the debris found in the disk affects the dynamics , migration rate , extent of migration , and the smoothness of migration .",
    "however , the total mass of the inner and outer debris disk along with the dust halo is not well known for hr 8799 . estimating the total mass in debris within a disk is difficult to compute accurately for both observational and theoretical reasons .",
    "solid ( non - gaseous ) matter , which emits continuously in the @xmath13 to mm wavelengths produces nearly all of the radiation @xcite .",
    "however , while the total cross section of the dust particles is many orders of magnitude larger than that of larger objects ( m to km sized asteroids , comets , and planetesimals ) , it is these later objects which comprise a majority of the total mass of the debris .",
    "these objects are not bright enough to individually detect in the wavelengths that they emit . but estimating the total mass of the debris is important to determining the dynamics .",
    "the halo and disk dust has been modelled by @xcite .",
    "the halo mass is estimated to be @xmath14 with a radius of up to 1000 au . estimating the dust mass of the other disk components is more difficult - particularly for the cold outer disk because the inner and outer edges are not well known . in the case of the inner edge",
    ", it was first thought to be at 90 au from temperature estimates while the outer radius had been modelled at 300 au to account for all the observational constraints , giving a total dust mass of @xmath15 .",
    "the inner disk is quite warm at @xmath16 , allowing for a very low dust mass estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "a brief summary of the modelled parameters that were used including assumed surface densities , inner and outer radii , minimum and maximum grain size , as well as total mass can be found in @xcite in their table 3 .",
    "recent submillimeter observations have added some additional constraints . @xcite",
    "examined hr 8799 and its debris disk with the submillimeter array at @xmath18 - a wavelength which is suitable for examining larger dust grains .",
    "low signal - to - noise prevented a full multi - parameter modelling of the dust at this wavelength but a combination of the sma data and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) seem to rule out a narrow ring of dust and favor a broad outer ring starting with an inner edge at @xmath19 au .",
    "scaling up from these modelled dust masses to a total debris disk mass can be difficult .",
    "small dust grains are typically evacuated in debris disks by a combination of poynting - robertson drag and radiation blow - out ( depending on grain size ) on very short timescales relative to the age of an average debris disk . to constantly replenish the dust in a system that is many millions of years old ,",
    "a collisional cascade is required @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the differential number distribution of the particles in mass is a power law which takes the form @xmath20 or simply @xmath21 in radius .",
    "the steady - state solution depends on an @xmath22 index of @xmath23 .",
    "this parameter has been estimated empirically and numerically in the previously mentioned literature and , assuming that @xmath22 is determined only by the mass - dependence of the collision rate and that the model is self - similar , can be shown to be that value analytically @xcite .    to estimate the total mass of the disk",
    ", we integrate the differential number distribution times the mass of these objects at a constant density from the minimum to maximum sizes in the cascade @xmath24 the constant in our number distribution can be set by using the model of the outer debris disk by @xcite .",
    "this model includes the minimum and maximum grain sizes that were used in order to create a synthetic sed which was matched to the observed data . with the dust mass estimate from that model , and a minimum and maximum grain size of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , the constant @xmath27 can be computed .    to find the total mass of the disk we repeat the previous calculation only with a new @xmath28 that corresponds to the largest radius objects in our collisional cascade .",
    "the total mass that this integrand will yield is entirely set by the upper bound because there are many orders of magnitude between the minimum and maximum object sizes .",
    "unfortunately , determining @xmath28 is difficult .    assuming the cascade operates for the system age @xcite estimated @xmath28 , assuming an alpha parameter of 11/6 , that used only observable properties of the debris disk . as per their equation 16 , @xmath29 ^ 2 \\left(\\frac{f_{\\tau}}{4}\\right)^{-2 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , the disk aspect ratio , and @xmath31 , the normal disk opacity at wavelength @xmath32 , are our disk observables .",
    "other parameters include @xmath33 , @xmath32 , r , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , which correspond to the stellar mass , observation wavelength , the radii at which there is a break in the surface brightness profile , specific energy , age , and an uncertainty factor",
    ".    however , hr 8799 has no constraints on the scale height because the disk is not resolved .",
    "we therefore adopt the @xmath37 pictoris estimate for @xmath30 by @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 pictoris is also an a star which has a similar age and mass to hr 8799 as well as an extended debris disk .",
    "estimates for the dust mass around @xmath37 pictoris have been found to be @xmath38 , or about @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath40 suggested by @xcite for hr 8799 .",
    "@xcite also notes that the amount of excess emission in the hr 8799 disk is similar to that of other debris disks around a stars ( see @xcite s study of the evolution of debris disks around a stars . )",
    "see table 1 by @xcite and references therein for mass , age , and other parameters for @xmath37 pictoris .",
    "we note that our biggest uncertainty is therefore in @xmath30 in the above formula , which goes as @xmath41 .",
    "this makes even small errors in estimates of @xmath30 have a large impact on @xmath42 .",
    "however , the goal is not to determine the exact mass of the disk , only to determine what a reasonable range is .    to find @xmath42",
    "we must also compute the opacity at a specific wavelength .",
    "the opacity can be measured by modifying our total dust mass integral .",
    "the opacity at a specific wavelength is a measure of the fractional area covered by particles of radius @xmath43 ( i.e. the opacity depends on the number of particles per unit area times the cross sectional area ) . in this way",
    "we can relate the number of particles of a specific radius to the opacity and total disk surface area .",
    "secondly , it is possible to equate the differential number distribution to @xmath44 by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we make use of a relation which describes how the opacity scales with the radius of the object , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is equivalent to @xmath48 from above and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the radius and opacity at a specific radius / wavelength @xcite .",
    "substituting the above three relationships into our mass computation yields an integral that is dependent only on the radius of the dust . using @xmath51 dust particles as the largest grains we find that the opacity at the specific dust particle radius is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total mass of the dust",
    ", @xmath54 is the total disk area , @xmath55 is the density of the dust grains , and @xmath49 is the radius of the largest dust grain in the model . using dust masses from @xcite as well as a disk area computed from the inner and outer edges and a maximum grain size from the same , along with a density appropriate for dust grains @xmath56 , we compute a value for the opacity of @xmath57 .    with these computed disk observables along with the other known parameters for hr 87999 we find an @xmath42 value of @xmath58 .",
    "this @xmath42 yields a disk mass estimate of @xmath59 or about one half of a jupiter mass .",
    "large debris disks are often attributed masses in the region of @xmath60 .",
    "while this estimate would place the disk mass usable in our simulations at of order a jupiter mass or less , there are a number of caveats to our estimates .",
    "we note that our estimate for @xmath42 is low compared to other disks by @xcite which place the radius at values anywhere from a few to a few hundred times larger . using an estimate for @xmath42 in line with those for",
    "@xmath37 pictoris and similar disks would yield a significantly more massive disk . also , we recognize that the masses of the planets are extreme , with four planets of ten jupiter masses each .",
    "it is not inconceivable that the disk may be significantly more massive than those observed previously .",
    "we also note that planetesimals with a radius of @xmath42 are the largest objects that contribute to the collisional cascade .",
    "significant mass could be found in other , more massive objects that would have collision times too long to contribute to dust production .",
    "finally , we note that the major phenomenon discussed in the paper occur at masses of one jupiter mass or less in the debris disk .",
    "it is not required for us to include much of the more massive disks , however , given the difficulty of estimating the mass and the general peculiarity and size of hr 8799 , we have included fairly generous debris disk masses .",
    "a second more generic estimate of the largest sized objects that can be grown was found by @xcite . using a numerical model which uses",
    "the reynold s averaged navier - stokes equations with both turbulence and full viscosity , they found that it was possible to create 10 - 100 km sized planetesimals .",
    "this would place our disk mass estimate of order @xmath61 .",
    "finally , we can use our own solar system as a reference point .",
    "the ` nice ' model required approximately 30 - 50 @xmath62 to explain the outward migration and eventual configuration of our own system @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a few tenths of a jupiter mass of debris .",
    "total debris disk masses used in our simulations varied , but had measurable effects at a neptune mass , or about 17 @xmath62 .",
    "this puts those simulated disk masses in a similar range to that of the ` nice ' model .",
    "larger masses than the ` nice ' model are justified by way of the discussion above . given the uncertainties in measuring @xmath42 , it is very difficult to determine if the largest total masses can be used in our simulations .",
    "the total particle number used in our simulations , 1024 , is also comparable to the 1000 - 5000 particles used in the ` nice ' model simulations .",
    "above we noted that the diameter of objects at the top end of the collisional distribution is anywhere between one to several hundred km .",
    "an @xmath42 value similar to @xmath37 pictoris of 180 km is about 6.5 times smaller than the diameter of pluto .",
    "@xmath42 values near 1 km would be approximately one thousand times smaller .",
    "this suggests that our simulated disks which are made up of at least a neptune mass in debris ( those that are massive enough to have measurable effects on the lifetime of the system ) would have planetesimals that are larger than those that are predicted by the collisional cascade .",
    "therefore , while our planetesimal masses are close to those used in the ` nice ' model , they could be more massive than those in hr 8799 s actual disk .",
    "this may result in more stochastic interactions between the planetesimals and planets .",
    "however , the planetesimal masses suggested by the collisional cascade are a distribution which could reasonably involve both smaller or larger planetesimals then those which we have suggested .",
    "all simulations were run with the software package _ _",
    "qymsym__. _ qymsym _ is a gpu - accelerated hybrid second order symplectic integrator which permits close encounters similar to the _ mercury _ software package developed by @xcite .",
    "like _ mercury _ , _ qymsym _ uses a second order symplectic integrator to advance the positions of all particles in a simulation in the typical manner described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "exploratory work on symplectic maps for n - body integrators was elucidated by @xcite",
    ". additional analytical work on the formulations of the symplectic integrator can be found by @xcite and by @xcite . unlike these first symplectic integrators but similar to _ mercury _ , _ qymsym _ flags any particle from an integration when it is deemed that it has a close approach to another massive particle during a time step .",
    "these are then integrated separately with an adaptive step - size conventional integrator .",
    "the criterion for closest approach is decided based on the hill radii of the interacting objects .",
    "_ qymsym _ uses the @xmath63 order hermite integration scheme detailed in @xcite rather than the bulirsch - stoer algorithm used in _",
    "mercury_. see @xcite for more details on the _ qymsym _ integrator .",
    "we note that due to the nature of our cuda based code , it is not possible to run less than one block worth of particles , even in the case where we wish a massless debris disk .",
    "furthermore , due to memory latencies , low particle counts are not run efficiently on the gpu .",
    "currently , we do not have the ability to disable the @xmath64 kick computation or a way to offload low particle counts to the cpu .",
    "this is something that could be rectified in future revisions of the code .",
    "additionally , because of the compilation process , our code is restricted to operating on machines which have gpu s attached .",
    "these two caveats have an effect on the number and size of the parameter space that we are able to explore .",
    "the inefficiency of the gpu at low particle count and single block restriction has the impact of reducing the length for which we can integrate our debris - less test case .",
    "we do not want to run multiple integrators .",
    "two hybrid - symplectic integrators will not get identical answers unless the collision integration method is the same . rather than use another hybrid - symplectic integrator ( like _ mercury _ ) to run debris - less test cases",
    ", we continue to use our own code",
    ". however , this does make it difficult to run simulations with as many orbital periods as those possible with integrators which can be run with very low particle counts .",
    "the gpu requirement also makes it more difficult to test a wide parameter space .",
    "a node must be equipped with a gpu in order to be able to run our code .",
    "the gpu clusters that we have access to are much smaller than the cpu clusters that are available .",
    "this limits the number of possible trials .",
    "last , we note that our integrator is truly @xmath64 - all particles feel the effects of all others .",
    "this is unlike many integrators available in the field which typically do not compute planetesimal - planetesimal effects .",
    "this makes our simulations more precise , but does increase the arithmetic intensity .",
    "all simulations were run on either dual or quad core intel core2 duo architecture cpu s with either gt200 of gf100 architecture nvidia gpu s , both of which are cuda capable double precision architectures .",
    "the code can easily be optimized to run on any linux kernel 2.6 + distribution with appropriate gpu hardware .",
    "timestep sizes were set to 0.016 ( out of a possible 2@xmath65 orbit ) corresponding to 42 days in simulations including hr 8799e and 93 days in simulations without .",
    "we used smoothing lengths which correspond to radii at least a few times larger than the size of the planets assuming a planet and planetesimal density of the order of @xmath66 and disregard any simulation during which the energy conservation ( given by @xmath67 ) dips below @xmath68 .",
    "additionally , we are only interested in the time to the onset of first instability , and do not need to concern ourselves with larger energy errors that may occur after a planet - planet interaction or ejection .    in a few simulations ,",
    "very high eccentricities were detected for planetesimals which had been ejected from the system during a close approach . because our integrator explicitly conserves angular momentum through the use of f and g functions when solving kepler s equations ( see @xcite for more details ) , these large eccentricities and their corresponding high velocities produced a drift in the location of the center of momentum .",
    "this is most likely due to the way a hybrid symplectic integrator typically updates the particles positions .",
    "if a particle has its position updated such that it is now in close proximity to another particle , it would feel a large force .",
    "typically this force is removed by reverse integration of the hamiltonian and the particle is then moved to a more accurate integration regime ( the hermite integrator in our case ) .",
    "however , if by chance that particle is updated to be very close to another , the assumptions made in the perturbation theory used to split the hamiltonian into components , namely that keplerian motion is dominant over interparticle forces , no longer applies .",
    "this means that the particle will not be correctly reverse integrated .",
    "this problem is common to many symplectic integrators .",
    "once a planetesimal has been ejected with a very high eccentricity this phenomenon is more likely to repeat .",
    "the high eccentricity means that its angle of impact will be nearly perpendicular to the motion of the other orbiting objects exterior to its current position .",
    "this newly large velocity relative to the size of the collision detection criteria makes it more likely for a particle to be updated from outside the collision detection criteria to be in close proximity to the colliding particle without being previously removed .",
    "including a larger collision detection criterion or reducing the timestep size of the simulation could resolve this problem , but at greatly increased simulation time . decreasing timestep size goes directly with total simulation time .",
    "due to the high velocities achieved by the particles , it would need to be decreased significantly .",
    "increasing the collision detection radius , which is some factor of the hill radius , will force more particles to be offloaded to the significantly slower hermite integration routines . not only is the hermite integrator @xmath64 ( and therefore suffers from non - linear increases in simulation time based on increasing particle count ) , but the number of particles included in the hermite integrator will increase by a factor that goes with the collisional volume - even small increases in the collision detection criteria can lead to significant increases in particle counts .",
    "alternatively , increasing the smoothing length can partially alleviate this problem but has the negative effect of smoothing out many of the important planetesimal / planetesimal dynamics .    to correct for this occasional error without greatly increasing simulation time",
    ", we wrote an additional check that could remove planetesimals which had eccentricities above an arbitrary threshold or those that collided with the star .",
    "additionally , particles which are no longer bound and have a high enough semi - major axis are removed .",
    "energy error checks are common in comparable literature ( see appendix of @xcite for an example ) as is planetesimal removal due to ejection .",
    "this check will have no effect on simulations in which planetesimals are not ejected or ejected with realistic velocities and eccentricities that are still close enough to interact or collide with another particle .",
    "only simulations which have particles with extremely large eccentricities will be quantitatively altered .",
    "as we would expect , in simulations where these particles are removed , it appears that the dynamics are qualitatively identical , only without the aforementioned drift in center of momentum .",
    "we also note that the center of mass is conserved to a high degree of accuracy and we maintain a satisfactory level of energy conservation throughout either type of integration .",
    "conservation of center of mass is typically on the order of one part in @xmath69 or better .",
    "we therefore present the results of the corrected and uncorrected simulations together - using uncorrected simulations when no drift is detected in their outputs and corrected versions elsewhere .",
    "the above timestep choice and numerical energy integration error are comparable to those reported by @xcite .",
    "we set up two initial configurations to test in our simulations detailed in each respective section .",
    "generally , given the importance of the 4:2:1 mmr in previous work , our simulations begin with this planetary configuration and have an additional debris disk or alternatively use a somewhat modified version of this planetary configuration .",
    "minimally , the simulations have the innermost two planets in a 2:1 mmr .",
    "three planet ( b , c , d ) plus debris disk simulations were based off of the stable configurations discussed by @xcite , using planet masses of 10 , 10 and 7 @xmath70 for planets d , c and b. four planet ( b , c , d , e ) plus debris disk simulations are based off the predicted orbital elements found by @xcite and use masses of 7 , 7 , 7 and 5 @xmath70 for planets e , d , c and b. our debris disk is simply a uniform distribution of 1024 equal mass particles . depending on total disk mass desired , the planetesimal mass was modified accordingly .",
    "this later set of initial positions and masses reflects the most current observational results by @xcite by including the fourth planet and the corresponding reduced masses required from the dynamical simulations that were run .",
    "the three planet configuration , while no longer representative of those more recent observations and simulations , is both practical and illuminating for several reasons .",
    "first , we note that the planet which is not included in the three - planet configuration is the most recently discovered innermost object .",
    "unless its presence destabilizes the system , we expect its effect on the migration rate of the outermost planet to be small in those simulations due to the proximity and mass of the debris disk to the outermost planet .",
    "additionally , we only use the three planet configuration for simulations in which the system is arbitrarily placed in an unstable configuration from the beginning .",
    "the four planet configuration has much smaller regions of stability . while the addition of the fourth planet would make it even easier for us to create an initially unstable configuration which shares orbital elements similar to those that are observed , it makes it significantly more unlikely for a system to move from an unstable region to a stable region via orbital migration .",
    "last , we recall that the recent work by @xcite which reduced hubble space telescope observations suggests best orbital fits for hr 8799b , c , d that coincide with the 1:2:4 mean motion resonance",
    ". this data agrees with previous work that fits only the three planets , but does not agree with dynamical simulations which included all four planets @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the innermost three planets , hr 8799c , d , e were the most likely planets to share mean motion resonances with b excluded .",
    "there is as of yet no consensus on the possible orbital elements or dynamical structure of hr 8799 other than the most long - lived systems having the innermost three planets in a 4:2:1 mean motion resonance or at least having the innermost two planets in a 2:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "therefore we assume that the 2:1 mean motion is the primary initial requirement for our simulated systems .",
    "because we are measuring the effects of planetary migration on system stability to determine if all unstable configurations remain so , it is useful to run the three planet system - it has larger regions of stability for the planets to migrate into . due to the computational intensity of the simulations and their corresponding time requirements , we were only able to run on the order of hundreds of simulations over a few months rather than tens or hundreds of thousands . given this limitation , it proved difficult to migrate large numbers of four planet configurations into regions of stability . this lower simulation number and corresponding low number of stabilized configurations would introduce a fine tuning problem to our analysis so we do not discuss those in greater detail , instead focusing on the three planet configurations for the stabilization through migration scenarios .",
    "this fine tuning issue could potentially be resolved via more stable initial conditions which would require significantly less planet migration to move from regions of instability to regions of stability .",
    "this issue is discussed in further detail in our results section .    in the three planet configurations the inner disk edge has a semi - major axis of @xmath71 = 2.5 and an outer disk edge of @xmath28 = 7.0 , corresponding to separations of 60 and 170 au . in the four planet configurations the inner disk edge has a semi - major axis of @xmath71 = 6.14 and an outer disk edge of @xmath28 = 20.69 , corresponding to separations of 90 and 300 au .",
    "this second set matches the estimated outer debris disk s observed inner and outer edges .",
    "the inner disk edge with reduced semi - major axis for the three planet configuration was used to encourage rapid planet - planetesimal crossings and therefore rapid migration .",
    "as mentioned previously , we forced our three planet configuration to become unstable on very short timescales .",
    "because of this , we require rapid migration in order for any outcome other than planet - planet scattering to be a possibility . the inclusion of a debris disk at a position more coincident with that which is observed would be possible with either faster or more gpus .",
    "this is because configurations that are stable on longer timescales - which allow for reduced amounts of planet migration to be necessary in order to stabilize an unstable configuration - could be used .",
    "we could additionally begin to experiment with the inclusion of the fourth planet as well as keep the outermost planet at its observed position rather than moving it in to encourage the system to become unstable .",
    "we found both the removal of the innermost planet and movement of the inner disk edge were helpful in finding these post - migration stable configurations .",
    "other simulation parameters include the hill factor for encounter detection and the k function ( see @xcite ) , both of which are set to 2.0 .",
    "the k function is an arbitrary function which weights certain part of the hamiltonian to be integrated in order to allow it to be broken up into evolutions operators which are otherwise not possible .",

    "these simulations differed only in the initial conditions of the planetesimals .",
    "does the addition of a relatively massive planetesimal disk allow for an increase in stability timescale ? to answer this question we created an unstable initial configuration for both the three and four planet configurations of hr 8799 . in either case , this was done by starting with actual observed orbital elements found by @xcite and @xcite and reducing the outermost planet s semi - major axis in small increments until the system was unstable on the time scale of thousands of orbits or less . in the three planet simulations , this gives an initial configuration with all three planets having orbital elements the same as those reported by @xcite except that the outermost planet s semi - major axis was reduced by @xmath77 .",
    "for the four planet simulations , the planets orbital configuration was identical to those found by @xcite but the outermost planet has a semi - major axis reduced by @xmath78 .",
    "this arbitrary and largely unstable configuration was chosen to both reduce simulation time as well as allow for pronounced effects by migration . due to the previously mentioned limitation in the number of total simulations it is possible to run and the extremely limited regions of stability available to the four planet configuration",
    ", we opted to run far more three planet simulations than four planet systems and present only that data .",
    "simulations both with and without eccentricity corrections are presented simultaneously and see no significant difference between them .      in figure",

    "can remain stable until the end of the simulation .",
    "given enough mass , migration via planetesimal scattering can take a tightly packed configuration of hr8799 b , c , d and e , or in the case of figures [ fig : stabilizing ] and [ fig:3p - migration ] , simply b , c and d , and migrate the outermost planet into a more stable configuration .",
    "the total migration for the outermost planet in system configurations which remained stable over the 5 myr simulation ranged from 5 to 15 au in semi - major axis depending on total disk mass .",
    "this migration occurred over a few hundred thousand years .",
    "if stable regions are small compared to unstable regions , migration is unlikely to put an initially unstable configuration into a stable region . only large migrations could significantly increase the stability time .",
    "this is consistent with what we see ; rapid migration caused by a massive disk is able to significantly affect the lifetime of our simulations .",
    "migration is expected to reduce planetary eccentricities and this could increase stability @xcite .",
    "we searched for signs that the outermost planet s eccentricity decreased during migration . in figure",
    "[ fig:3p - migration ] we see oscillations in eccentricity of the outermost planet were large throughout the simulation due to the proximity and high masses of the inner planets .",
    "we therefore attribute the increased stability time to the wider separation rather than any eccentricity damping .    as a planet migrates outwards it can cross mean motion resonances with other planets . for simulations with short lifetimes , we searched for evidence that resonant crossing caused instability .",
    "we examined any relevant @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath63 order resonance possible between the outer planet and innermost planet as well as the outer planet and the middle planet .",
    "we saw no large semi - major axis or eccentricity jumps caused by resonant crossing so they are unlikely to be the cause of instability in the simulations with shorter lifetimes .",
    "resonances near the outer planet s position are primarily @xmath81 or @xmath82 order and cause smaller eccentricity jumps due to the weaker dependence on mass @xcite .",
    "as discussed in our section on simulation parameters , our choice of unstable configurations was done in part to reduce the amount of simulation time . with an initial planetary configuration so far from a region of stability , a large amount of migration is required in order to move the planet to a more stable region of phase space .",
    "because of this , only a massive debris disk can migrate the outermost planet sufficiently far to increase the lifetime .",
    "another concern with this set of simulations is that with a planetesimal count of 1024 and a total disk mass of at least a jupiter mass , interactions between planetesimals and planets would cause stochastic migration @xcite .",
    "we would have expected such large planetesimal masses to cause instability rather than increase the lifetime of the system .",
    "therefore , we have no reason to suspect that stochastic behavior is a problem . because the typical disk mass required to stabilize the system is unrealistically large there may be no need to resolve the disk more accurately . as mentioned previously , an approximate upper limit for debris mass",
    "is thought to be on the order of @xmath83 , or approximately one jupiter mass . for hr 8799 , this is effectively the minimum amount of mass required for any observable effects in our simulations .",
    "in this second set of simulations we examine the impact of a planetesimal debris disk on the stability time of a configuration of planets which was stable for about 150k orbits ( or around 7 myr ) sans debris disk . in these simulations",
    "we begin with all four planets situated in an orbital configuration based off the current estimated positions by @xcite .",
    "this four planet configuration is generally extremely unstable unless situated in a 4e:2d:1c mmr .",
    "as before , smoothing lengths are set to sizes a few times the radii of the planet to prevent the unrealistic forces possible if two particles form a very tight binary or collide within what would have been considered an approximate planetary radius .",
    "energy error is typically even lower in these simulations with a @xmath84 at @xmath85 or @xmath86 due to reduced planetesimal masses .",
    "we stopped simulations after their first planet - planet encounter regardless of the eventual fate of the interacting planets .",
    "stability time in the histogram is the time to first planet - planet encounter .",
    "we began by simulating the four planets with an initial orbital configuration comparable to that by @xcite with massless debris and plotted the resonant arguments .",
    "we see constrained resonant angles which indicate the presence of a 2:1 mmr between the inner two planets , shown in figure [ fig : angles ] . while @xcite did not directly show the resonant argument to illustrate that hr 8799d and e were in resonance , our plot is similar to figure 10 by @xcite although for hr 8799e and d rather than d and c. the integrator confirms that this planetary configuration is in resonance as suggested by @xcite .    matching the exact age found by @xcite",
    "is difficult despite the fact that there is no longer a requirement of planetesimals with mass .",
    "this is due to the way the integrator operates .",
    "specifically , it is not possible to integrate less than a certain number of particles , depending on compile time and hardware restrictions . for more details on the exact nature of the code",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",

    "these 18 simulations are identical in terms of planetesimal mass , total disk mass , initial outer and inner disk edge , and initial planetary orbital configuration .",
    "however , the planetesimals initial orbital configurations have been randomized 18 different ways .",
    "the histogram shown in figure [ fig : histogram ] shows the distribution in lifetimes of the eighteen simulations each with a neptune mass disk .",
    "figure [ fig:4p ] shows the evolution in time of the semi - major axis of all four planets of a sample simulation .",
    "the error bars indicate the minimum and maximum separations .",
    "myrs.,width=321 ]          in figure [ fig : histogram ] we see that in 16 of 18 simulations the stability time has decreased by at least 2 myrs from the initial ` stable ' configuration which had its first planet interactions after 7 myrs .",
    "we see a broad distribution of lifetimes . even though a neptune mass disk is only about @xmath88 the mass of the outer most planet it has an effect on the stability time . with a neptune mass disk each simulated planetesimal has a mass of about 8 plutos .",
    "debris disk models estimate the top of the collisional cascade to contain similar ( but slightly smaller ) size bodies .",
    "for example , @xcite argued for a distribution of planetesimals in the fomalhaut system with a range of sizes between 4 and 1000 km .",
    "as discussed previously , this second value roughly coincides with pluto s diameter within a factor of a few of what we used in our simulations .",
    "stochastic perturbations are expected in real systems ; however they will be somewhat smaller than those present in our simulation do to our factor of 8 difference in mass of planetesimals .",
    "figure 3 by @xcite demonstrates why a planetesimal disk with a total mass around that of neptune can have such a pronounced effect on the stability time . in this plot ,",
    "dark regions indicate highly likely configurations of eccentricity and semi - major axis for planet d , whereas yellow regions indicate strongly chaotic systems . here",
    "we see that semi - major axis changes of less than 0.1 au can move planet d from a stable region to a strongly chaotic one .",
    "similarly , minor changes in eccentricity can also have a large effect .",
    "@xcite s figure 7 shows a similar behavior .",
    "note that a change in current separation of planet d by 0.05 in the figure ( corresponding to semi - major axis change of 1.22 au ) can decrease the stability time by as much as four orders of magnitude .",
    "a three order of magnitude change in stability time is possible with a semi - major axis increase of approximately half an au . in either example",
    "the regions of stability have sharp edges between stable and chaotic solutions .",
    "we would expect a disk mass of @xmath88 the mass of a planet to be able to migrate a planet roughly @xmath88 of the semi - major axis if a majority of its angular momentum is transferred to the planet via scattering .",
    "if this were the case than a neptune mass disk would be able to migrate the outer planet ( which has a mass of @xmath90 at 68 au ) approximately 0.5 au .",
    "this is more than enough to vary the lifetime by many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore we looked for the number of planetesimals which had become orbit crossing by the time each simulation had become unstable . in all 16 simulations , at least @xmath91 of the disk mass was orbit crossing .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum of 2.5 @xmath62 . by starting a simulation near the edges of a region of stability , we see that even lower mass debris disks can affect the stability time .",
    "we continuously monitor the planets orbital elements throughout all simulations to see if they are in resonance with one another .",
    "we do this by noting whether or not the resonant angle librates around 0 or @xmath65 .",
    "we looked for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath63 order mean motion resonances that could exist near each of the planets semi - major axis at varying times .",
    "we did not observe any strong two body resonances beyond the 2:1 mmr between e and d , a much weaker 2:1 mmr between d and c , and no clear resonant angles for b. we attribute this to the overwhelmingly large gravitational perturbations caused by the massive planets as well as the fact that most of the nearby resonances for the planets were of higher order .",
    "this prevented behavior similar to the ` nice ' model during which migration causes resonance crossing and corresponding eccentricity increases .",
    "finally , we see that in all simulations when the planets e and d are pulled out of the 2:1 mmr the system rapidly becomes unstable .    in figure",
    "[ fig : angles]a we see that the resonant angle for the 2:1 mmr between hr 8799e and d over the 7 myr simulation remains largely unaffected until the end of the simulation .",
    "however , in figure [ fig : angles]b we note that the extreme values of @xmath92 begin to increase over time , leading to e and d moving out of resonance and the rapid disruption of the system . in this particular example , the system s lifetime is decreased by about 50@xmath93 .",
    "it is possible the debris disk is responsible for pulling hr 8799 out of resonance and so , reducing its lifetime .",
    "in this paper we discuss how a planetesimal debris disk can effect the stability of the multiple planet system hr 8799 .",
    "two questions are considered ; whether it is possible to destabilize a stable planetary configuration with a planetesimal debris disk and conversely , whether it is possible to stabilize an unstable configuration with a planetesimal debris disk .",
    "we examine both three planet ( b , c , d ) and four planet configurations ( b , c , d , e ) .    in three planet configurations which were unstable on short timescales without a debris disk , only massive debris disks ( @xmath94 the mass of the outermost planet ) could cause increases in stability time . in four planet configurations which were stable over long timescales without a debris disk , debris disks of only a neptune in mass ( @xmath88 the outer planet )",
    "can cause large decreases in lifetimes .",
    "we attribute this sensitivity to the small size of hr 8799 s resonant region of stability .    while the amount of disk mass required for system stabilization in our simulations is unrealistic , it is only required to be this large due to the initial conditions . in order to run a large number of simulations , a highly unstable configuration that rapidly had planetary encounters",
    "was required .",
    "given an initial configuration which is just outside a region of stability , it would be possible to cause sufficient migration to allow an unstable configuration to become stable with a more reasonable disk mass .",
    "similarly , while the disk properties required for system disruption in our simulations are reasonable in both total mass and planetesimal size , the mass distribution for the planetesimals is not a true mass distribution . in order to keep total particle number down",
    "we restrict all planetesimals to have an identical 8 pluto sized mass .",
    "we do not believe that this had a large effect on the distribution of stability times of the system when a disk is included because a realistic mass distribution could encourage even more stochastic migration if there are even a few planetesimals of greater mass .",
    "these results suggest that hr 8799 may be destined for eventual planet scattering .",
    "the very high masses of the planets causes regions of stability to be relatively small and makes it possible for low mass debris disks to pull the system out of its mean motion resonances and induce instability .",
    "we also see that migration is much more likely to make the system unstable than migrate the system to a region of stability",
    ". it may be the case that the debris disk has already been responsible for removing the system from a maximally stable region and is currently near the boundary of instability .",
    "all of these possibilities tend to induce instability rather than stability and suggest that hr 8799 may be headed towards instability , possibly sooner than would otherwise be predicted .    in this study",
    "we have used initial conditions consistent with observed positions of the planets when attempting to determine whether a stable orbital configuration could be made unstable by a debris disk . as we have shown here",
    ", a low mass disk can cause evolution of the planetary configuration . consequently , in the past the planets could have been in a different configuration . by exploring different initial conditions future investigations could explore scenarios for the past evolution of hr 8799 that would be consistent with its current configuration .",
    "for example , if the planetesimal disk is causing the system to move out of resonance , in the past it may have been in a more stable region of this resonance , instead of on its boundary .",
    "increasing simulation length and particle count could also increase the resolution of our simulations .",
    "alternatively , it appears that similar simulations could be used to put upper limits on planetesimal debris disk mass if it is assumed that the debris disk has a negligible dynamical effect . in the case of our simulations of hr 8799 , planetesimal disk masses would need to be much smaller than one neptune in mass .",
    "the stability timescale for an hr 8799-like system is very sensitive to small alterations in planetary orbital elements .",
    "this sensitivity implies that the effects of planetesimal debris disks may not be negligible for systems with such small regions of stability .",
    "however , dynamical simulations of hr 8799 sans planetesimal disk were used to determine the resonant structure of the system and constrain observations while not including all the required dynamics .",
    "the assumption of long term maximum stability may be erroneous when debris disks could allow for migration of planets from currently observed stable regions to unstable configurations or vice versa .",
    "in general , it would appear that using dynamical models which do not include the effects of planetesimals to constrain observations may be unwise when a system is known to have such limited regions of stability .",
    "additionally , the long term stability of systems with lower mass disks could still be important . in these systems",
    "the planets will typically be smaller and the regions of stability would be larger .",
    "however , reduced planet mass would increase the migration rate ."
