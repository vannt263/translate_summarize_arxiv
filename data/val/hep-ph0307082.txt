    "the problem of dynamics of mesons at low energies is important .",
    "it plays a major role in the precise determination of the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( ckm ) which is a main part of the study of the standard model flavour sector  @xcite . in this talk",
    "i will concentrate on the theory behind the measurement of @xmath0 from @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) decays and in particular on the recent work of p.  talavera and myself on the two - loop calculation and the determination of the relevant low - energy constants  @xcite .",
    "i review shortly chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and the relevant two - loop calculations done up to now , followed by a discussion of @xmath2 and the present theory situation .",
    "i include a short discussion of the validity of the linear approximation of the form factors normally used in the data analysis .",
    "the main relevant results from chpt  @xcite can be summarized as follows .",
    "the curvatures are important in the analysis but can be predicted using chpt from the pion electromagnetic form - factor  @xcite and all order @xmath1 parameters needed to determine @xmath0 can be experimentally obtained via the scalar form factor , @xmath5 , in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the curvature of @xmath5 can be predicted as well from knowledge about scalar form factors of the pion  @xcite , albeit only at fairly low precision at present .",
    "chpt is an effective field theory valid as an approximation to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies .",
    "its modern form has was introduced by weinberg , gasser and leutwyler  @xcite .",
    "the global chiral symmetry , @xmath6 , of qcd in the limit of massless quarks is spontaneously broken down to the diagonal subgroup @xmath7 by a nonzero quark condensate , @xmath8 the eight broken generators lead to eight goldstone bosons .",
    "these are massless _ and _ their interactions vanish at zero momentum .",
    "the latter allows the construction of a well defined perturbative expansion in terms of momenta , generically referred to as an expansion in @xmath9 .",
    "quark masses are usually counted as order @xmath9 since @xmath10 . inserting an external photon or @xmath11-bosons counts as order @xmath12 since",
    "these are included via covariant derivatives .",
    "recent lectures , much more detailed than what is included here are  @xcite .",
    "chpt being an effective field theory implies that the number of parameters increases order by order . in the purely mesonic strong and semi - leptonic sector",
    "there are two parameters at lowest order ( @xmath9 ) , ten at nlo ( @xmath13 )  @xcite , and 90 at nnlo ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the renormalization procedure and the divergences are worked out in general to nnlo  @xcite and provide a good check on all calculations .",
    "one problem shared with other high order loop calculations in comparing different calculations is the use of different renormalization schemes .",
    "the calculations that were used to determine all the needed parameters are those of the masses and decay constants @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite and the electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 chpt calculation for is rather cumbersome .",
    "i will use our work ,  @xcite but an independent calculation exists  @xcite and agrees reasonably well , the difference is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we write the amplitude as f_+(t ) & = & 1 + f_+^(4)(t)/f_^2 + f_+^(6)(t)/f_^4 f_+^(4)(t ) = t l_9^r/2 + , + f_+^(6)(t ) & = & -8 ( c_12^r+c_34^r ) ( m_k^2-m_^2)^2 + t r_+1^k + t^2 ( - 4 c_88^r + 4 c_90^r ) + ( l_i^r ) .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor data yield  @xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 with this input we fit the cplear data and obtain    = -(4.70.5 )  10 ^ -5  ^2 _ + = 0.01700.0015 .",
    "the first agrees with the vmd estimate  @xcite @xmath32 .",
    "the latter comes from chpt as _ + = 0.0283  ( p^4 )   + 0.0011  ( p^6 )   -0.0124 ( c_i^r ) .",
    "our main conclusion follows from rewriting the full @xmath1 result for @xmath5 as f_0(t ) & = & 1-(8/f_^4)(c_12^r+c_34^r ) ( m_k^2-m_^2)^2 + ( 8 t / f_^4 ) ( 2c_12^r+c_34^r ) ( m_k^2+m_^2 ) + & & + t/(m_k^2-m_^2)(f_k / f_-1 ) -(8 t^2/f_^4 ) c_12^r + ( t)+(0 ) .",
    "@xmath33\\pm0.0028[l_i^r]\\ , , $ ] is known and an expression for @xmath34 can be found in ref .  @xcite the errors are an estimate of higher orders and using fits of the @xmath35 using different assumptions .",
    "the @xmath1 estimate of @xcite corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "i discussed the @xmath2 form factors in chpt to order @xmath1 .",
    "the main conclusions are that the curvatures for @xmath22 and @xmath5 can be predicted from the data on pion electromagnetic  @xcite and scalar  @xcite form - factors , the curvature in @xmath22 and @xmath5 should be taken into account in new precision experiments but from the slope and the curvature we can determine experimentally the needed parameters to calculate @xmath18 . a precision of better than one percent seems feasible for @xmath17 .      99 m.  battaglia _ et al .",
