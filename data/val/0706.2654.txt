    "the wmap measurements of fine details of the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite have lent a strong support to the idea that the universe underwent an inflationary expansion in the distant past  @xcite . the wmap data , along with the independent observations of the dimming of type ia supernovae in distant galaxies @xcite also favour a result of growing evidence that a large fraction of the energy density of the present universe is ` dark ' and has a negative pressure , thereby leading to the ongoing accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether it is possible to unify the inflation and quintessential fields . in a viable theory",
    "the primordial inflation may lead to have a dark energy effect in the conditions of concurrent universe .",
    "this picture merits broader discussion .",
    "the main observation that has led many to believe that the dark energy is einstein s cosmological constant @xmath9 , for which @xmath10 identically and at all times , is the concordance of different cosmological data sets , which appear to indicate that the dark energy equation of state @xmath11 is not much different from @xmath12 at the present epoch .",
    "this solution to dark energy , however , raises two immediate questions : ( i ) why is @xmath13 today ? and",
    "( ii ) why is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) so tiny ?",
    "apparently , @xmath16 is fifteen orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale ( @xmath17 ) , the energy domain of major elementary particles in standard model physics , and it is not known at present how to derive it from other small constants in particle physics .",
    "the cosmological constant as the source of dark energy is only a possibility .",
    "the other possibility is that the cosmological constant ( or gravitational vacuum energy ) is fundamentally variable .",
    "explicit examples are provided by models that use a dynamical scalar field @xmath0 with a suitably defined scalar potential @xmath18 .",
    "quintessence models are among the most popular alternatives to einstein s cosmological constant as they generally predict at late times a small ( but still an appreciable ) deviation from the central prediction of einstein s cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "observations only require that @xmath20 at present epoch  @xcite , so one finds worth studying models that support a time - varying dark energy .",
    "there are arguments in the literature  @xcite that an appropriate modification of einstein s theory provides an alternative resolution to dark energy problem and a natural framework to address the inflationary paradigm . in this context ,",
    "higher - dimensional braneworlds models , scalar - tensor theories and @xmath21 gravity models , which derive motivations from the original idea of kaluza and klein to its modern manifestation in string theory , have been of particular interest .",
    "a simple modification of einstein s theory of general relativity , which involves a fundamental scalar field @xmath0 with a self - interacting potential @xmath18 , is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the inverse planck mass @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "this theory has been studied over the last three decades by crafting different types of scalar potentials .",
    "the list of the potentials can be frustratingly long , which includes the quadratic potential @xmath26 widely considered in inflationary contexts and the inverse power - law potential @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "these examples are perhaps sufficiently simple to understand the basic ideas of inflation and/or the dynamics dark energy in the concurrent universe , for a review , see  @xcite , but they hardly explain the cosmic expansion of our universe exhibiting all relevant cosmological properties .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether it is possible to unify the inflation and quintessential fields by finding ( or constructing ) a more general potential .",
    "the model of quintessential inflation  @xcite proposed by peebles and vilenkin uses the idea that inflaton potential could end up as an effective present - day cosmological constant  @xcite or _ quintessence _  @xcite .",
    "although quite appealing , the potential considered in  @xcite , which consists of two parts : @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) for inflation and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for quintessence , finds no natural field theoretic motivations .",
    "recently , attempts have been made in constructing a working model of quintessential inflation within the context of higher dimensional braneworld models , see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein for the earlier proposals . also , there are suggestions that a unification of the inflationary era ( triggered by @xmath33 type corrections ) and the late - time acceleration can be made through a simple construction of the modified f(r ) models  @xcite , as well as within the framework of reconstruction of scalar - tensor gravity  @xcite .    in this paper , we reconstruct an explicit observationally viable model for evolution from inflation to the present epoch by maintaining the structure of the theory defined by  ( [ e - h ] ) .",
    "our reconstruction approach yields a smooth , exponential potential that describes both the inflation and quintessential parts .",
    "the model can be shown to be compatible with current cosmological observations , and , presumably , it can be embedded in higher dimensional theories of gravity , such as string theory .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we motivate our construction with an appropriate ansatz for an inflaton field .",
    "we then invert the system of autonomous equations to determine the inflaton potential , along with other cosmological variables .",
    "there we also find conditions that have to be satisfied by the reconstructed potential to be consistent with the wmap inflationary data . in section 3 ,",
    "we briefly discuss about an efficient method of reheating , so called ` instant preheating ' , applicable to our model . in section 4",
    ", we include the effect of ordinary fields and then find an explicit quintessence potential in a background dominated by radiation ( or matter ) . in section 5",
    ", we show how the reconstructed potential produces an observationally significant effective dark energy and its associated late - time cosmic acceleration . in section 6",
    ", we discuss on a possible way of evading local gravity constraints imposed on the model .",
    "further generalization of our construction with higher - order corrections is briefly discussed in section 7 .",
    "finally , section 8 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we neglect the effect of ordinary fields ( matter and radiation ) .",
    "the set of autonomous equations of motion following from  ( [ e - h ] ) , with @xmath34 , is given by @xmath35,\\\\   \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}}{h } & = & 2 m\\z{p}^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{h }   \\frac{dh}{d\\phi}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the hubble expansion parameter and @xmath37 is the scale factor of a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "one of the most crucial parts of a consistent inflationary model is to understand the time - evolution of the inflaton field @xmath0 .",

    "the evolution of the inflaton field in ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) , or equivalently @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) , is a generic solution for a modulus and/or dilaton field in many four - dimensional string models , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the assumption ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) holds , almost universally , in many well motivated inflationary models that satisfy slow roll conditions , after a few e - folds of expansion .",
    "for instance , for the chaotic model of inflation with the potential @xmath47 , one has @xmath48 ( cf equation  ( 2.4 ) , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and thus @xmath49 . as discussed in  @xcite , even for two scalar fields model ,",
    "if the slow - roll conditions @xmath50 are satisfied at hubble exit , then @xmath51 depends linearly only on the field values , leading to a generic situation that @xmath52 ( small correction ) .",

    "the energy scale @xmath60 ( which appears as an integration constant ) can be fixed by the amplitude of density perturbations observed at the cobe experiments , namely @xmath61 . with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , assuming that @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 .    with a slowly varying @xmath66 , the scalar curvature perturbation can be shown to be  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "it is convenient to specify it as a function of the number of @xmath74-folds .    in the case @xmath75",
    ", we get @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77 .",
    "the scalar potential takes a familiar form : @xmath78 $ ] , where @xmath79 .",
    "the number of e - folds is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath82 is small only for a limited range of inflaton values , @xmath83 , the number of e - folds is large only when @xmath43 is very small . in this case , however , almost no gravitational waves would be produced , leading to an exponentially suppressed ( close to zero ) tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "the spectrum of scalar ( density ) perturbations is also almost harrison - zeldovich type , @xmath84 .",
    "this last result is , however , not consistent with wmap observations  @xcite .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we demand that @xmath85 ; more precisely , @xmath86 so that @xmath87 . the spectral index @xmath88 is now given by @xmath89 ( up to leading order in slow roll parameters ) where @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the number of e - folds of inflation between the epoch when the horizon scale modes left the horizon and the end of inflation .     the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath92 vs the scalar spectral index @xmath70 , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( top to bottom ) and @xmath95 .",

    "we summarize the results in a table ( for @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure  [ ns - vs - r ] we show the plot of tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath105 with respect to @xmath88 , and in figure  [ ns - vs - alpha ] the plot of @xmath88 with respect to @xmath42 . within our model , both @xmath88 and @xmath105 do not much depend on the number of e - folds except when @xmath43 is positive , which we reject on physical grounds .    with the wmap3 bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath106 , we find @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",

    "we conclude this section with a couple of remarks .",
    "studies in @xcite show that , in slow - roll inflation , one may relate the variation of the inflaton in terms of e - folds @xmath126 to the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath105 @xmath127 the wmap bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath128 ( @xmath129 confidence level ) .",
    "this then implies that @xmath130 in the present construction .",
    "this is completely consistent with our discussion above .",

    "the scalar potential for some representative values of @xmath135 ( top to bottom ) , @xmath136 and @xmath137.,width=345 ]    the shape of the potential ( as depicted in figure  [ full - poten ] ) as well as its functional form is qualitatively similar to a class of scalar potentials one would obtain via warped flux compactifications of string theory , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the predicted characteristics of inflationary phase ( of the potential ) can easily be made to comply with the wmap results  @xcite .",
    "so our method of reconstruction may be considered as a point in favour of providing a believable physical basis for the inflation .",
    "moreover , a large part of our construction does not depend on the details of string theory or the dynamics of scalar fields abundant in any higher dimensional theories but has a general validity , and thus would remain useful even if string theory is invalidated .",
    "a satisfactory model of inflation should perhaps be followed by a successful reheating . to this end ,",
    "the ` instant preheating ' mechanism presented in  @xcite and applied to exponential potentials in  @xcite might perhaps be the most efficient method for reheating the universe .",
    "here we briefly outline a viable mechanism of reheating in our model , leaving the details for future publication .    according to ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) , after a few e - folds of inflation , since @xmath138",
    ", one has @xmath139 .",
    "clearly , with @xmath140 , the kinetic term never dominates the potential term . as a result there remains the possibility that the expansion enters inflation from which it never recovers .",
    "so our model has a chance to work only if the matter and/or radiation energy density terms sometime after inflation is large enough to dominate the inflaton energy density .",
    "without loss of generality , we can make the inflation end at the origin by translating the field @xmath141 so after inflation @xmath142 .",
    "following  @xcite we assume that the inflaton field @xmath143 interacts with another scalar field @xmath144 .",
    "the interaction lagrangian is @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are coupling constants , and @xmath148 is a fermi field .",
    "the production of @xmath144 particles commences when the adiabatic condition @xmath149 is violated , i.e. when @xmath150 , where @xmath151 .",
    "so , the particle production may occur when @xmath152 the process of particle production occurs nearly instantaneously , within the time @xmath153 during which the field @xmath143 remains in the vicinity of @xmath154 . as the field rolls to @xmath155 direction ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath144 particles begins to grow , since @xmath151 .",

    "the energy density of particles of the @xmath144 field created in this process is @xmath157 where the number density @xmath158 .",
    "if the @xmath144 particles can rapidly decay into fermions or the quanta of the @xmath144 field were to convert ( or thermalize ) into radiation , then the radiation energy density would increase sharply to @xmath159 at the end of instant preheating @xmath160 although @xmath161 is small quantity to begin with ( for any generic value of the coupling @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) , @xmath164 ( or the decay product of the @xmath144 field ) will decrease as @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) and come to dominate @xmath167 since the field @xmath143 is rolling down an exponential potential and its energy density could decrease much faster @xmath168 after inflation . to illustrate this one considers a cosmic evolution by suppressing @xmath169 , so @xmath170 ,",
    "whose solution is @xmath171 . according to ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) , @xmath172 and hence @xmath173 .",
    "we then find @xmath174 for @xmath175 , there would be no kinetic regime .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath164 ( or the decay products of the @xmath144 field ) may decrease much slower @xmath176^n$ ] ( @xmath177 ) than @xmath178 , it will eventually dominate the scalar energy density before the production of light elements or the bbn epoch .",
    "instant preheating may be followed by reheating which occurs through the decay of @xmath144 particles to fermions as is evident from the interaction term in ( [ interaction1 ] ) .",
    "given that the inflaton field @xmath0 decays to some radiation and heavy particles , it would be natural to expect , at later stages of inflation , small but nonzero values for both the matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "the growth in matter energy density can naturally affect ( or modify ) the form ( or shape ) of the scalar potential , leading to an additional term in the potential with a relatively large slope .",
    "this last feature is perhaps required to make our model compatible with the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) bound imposed on the scalar field energy density .",
    "here we take the matter lagrangian in its simplest form , which is einsteinian @xmath179 where @xmath180 , @xmath181 ( matter ) or @xmath182 ( radiation ) . of course",
    ", one could allow in principle an explicit coupling between the @xmath0-field and matter .",
    "it is believed that inflation was followed by an instant preheating ( or reheating ) and then by a radiation dominated phase , so the strength of coupling between the field @xmath0 and matter could be neglected during both the inflationary and the radiation - dominated epochs .",
    "any such couplings , however , can be relevant at later stages of evolution , especially , at galactic distance scales ( see section  [ evading ] ) .    the set of autonomous equations of motion that follows from equations  ( [ e - h ] ) and ( [ matter - lag ] ) may be given by  @xcite @xmath183 \\,h^2(\\phi ) , \\label{grav - scal1 } \\\\",

    "this last assumption is consistent with the fact that the fixed point solution @xmath187 is always unstable .",
    "notice that the behaviour @xmath188 holds also in the presence of ordinary fields ( matter and radiation ) .    from equations  ( [ grav - scal1])-([grav - scal3 ] ) , along with equation  ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) , we find @xmath189,\\label{recon - tot - po}\\\\ \\epsilon(\\phi ) & = & -\\frac{3}{2 } ( 1+w)\\omega_w -   b(\\phi),\\\\ \\omega_w & = & \\frac{c(\\phi)}{c\\z{0}+ 3(1+w)\\int ( - c(\\phi))\\,dn(\\phi)},\\label{omega - w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath190 is an integration constant and @xmath191 @xmath192.\\ ] ]",

    "but within solar system distances , where @xmath284 is roughly @xmath285 times larger than its value on large ( hubble ) scales , the term proportional to @xmath284 can be more relevant . on earth , @xmath286 ,",

    "we can get @xmath306 , without requiring a superluminal expansion @xmath307 , or having to introduce a non - canonical ( phantom ) field .",
    "most features of the model ( [ e - h ] ) would arise in the limit where @xmath308 and @xmath309 are sub - leadings to @xmath18 ( see below ) .    in the above model",

    "next we briefly discuss some qualitative features of the reconstructed scalar potential with a nonzero @xmath322 . with the ansatz  ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) , and with @xmath323 ,",
    "the reconstructed potential is given by equation  ( [ total - potential ] ) ; the parameter @xmath324 reads @xmath325 clearly , in the case @xmath326 , the coupling @xmath296 could increase the period of inflation by making @xmath327 smaller .",
    "this effect can be opposite in the case @xmath328 : it could be that inflation ended due to a slowly increasing derivative of the coupling , @xmath329 , such that @xmath330 .    with @xmath331 ,",
    "the corresponding potential may be reconstructed by providing an extra condition or by demanding a specific relation between the functions @xmath18 and @xmath296 ( see , e.g.  @xcite , where a general method of reconstruction was developed , including the effect of scalar - gauss - bonnet coupling ) . in the particular case that @xmath332 , we find @xmath333 where @xmath334 + const . again , after a few e - folds of inflation , since @xmath335\\ll 1 $ ] , we get @xmath336 this result reveals a generic situation that the coupled gauss - bonnet term is only subleading to the potential @xmath18",
    ". this behavior of our model may be present also when the hubble parameter changes appreciably with e - folding time , as happens at later stages of inflation .",
    "the presence of ordinary fields ( matter and radiation ) in our model does not introduce much complication , apart from slightly modified expressions for @xmath18 and @xmath322 , for the added degrees of freedom come with additional equations of motion .",
    "we have presented an explicit cosmological model for evolution from inflation to the present epoch that we believe satisfies the main observational constraints , including fine details of the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , e.g. , a red - tilted scalar spectrum with small tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath337 , the bound imposed on @xmath7 during the nucleosynthesis epoch and present epoch local gravity tests .",
    "it is therefore potentially of great utility .    in our analysis",
    ", just one assumption , equation  ( [ ansatz - phi1 ] ) , that is regarding the evolution of inflaton field , has been made , which is indeed a common feature of many motivated slow - roll type inflationary models .",
    "moreover , for a slowly rolling inflaton field , @xmath338 , the gravity waves or the amplitude of tensor perturbations can be suppressed in our model .",
    "this might actually be needed in our model , in order to satisfy the bbn bound .",
    "the present proposal also simplifies the role of the inflaton by almost decoupling it from the ( background ) matter on large cosmological scales . on the scale of the solar system , due to the large surrounding matter density",
    ", the dark energy field can be sufficiently massive , e.g. , @xmath339 , thereby quenching the deviations from einstein s gravity on distances larger than a fraction of millimeter .",
    "moreover , the model possesses an attractor behaviour for the inflaton and matter densities analogous to the tracking solution of , e.g. , the inverse power - law potential , @xmath340 with @xmath28 .",
    "the model proposed here may provide a reasonable explanation to the question : _ why is the cosmological vacuum energy small _ ?",
    "the interpretation of gravitational vacuum energy ( or dark energy ) in our framework is _ likely _ to yield @xmath341 and exhibit scaling behaviour for @xmath178 , being proportional to the square of the hubble rate . as a result , within our model",
