    "when a polymer is placed in a solution , eventually , as the temperature ( or the solvent quality ) is lowered , it undergoes a transition from an extended ( coil ) to a collapsed ( globule ) configuration , at the so called @xmath8 temperature @xcite .",
    "this transition is continuous and in the parameter space of a grand - canonical formalism , it may be identified as a tricritical point @xcite .    in the standard lattice model to study this collapse transition , the polymer is represented by a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) - where no site and no bond are visited more than once - and the presence of the solvent is taken into account in an effective manner by introducing an attractive interaction between nearest neighbor ( nn ) monomers which are not consecutive in the walk ( we use the terminology of monomers , placed on sites of the lattice , connected by bonds which are on lattice edges ) .",
    "the grand - canonical solution of this interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model on hierarchical ( bethe and husimi ) lattices exhibits the expected tricritical point @xcite .",
    "exact results for this model on regular two - dimensional lattices lead to the tricritical exponents @xmath9 @xcite , and it is believed that @xmath10 in 3d , corresponding to the classical ( mean - field ) value , since @xmath11 is the upper critical dimension for a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "these exponents - in the so - called @xmath8-universality class - are also found when interactions between _ next - nearest _ monomers are included in the system @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if the site ( monomer ) interaction is replaced by a bond interaction ( between bonds on opposite edges of elementary squares ) on the square lattice , the phase diagram may change , due to the appearance of a stable dense polymerized phase for the model defined on a @xmath1 husimi lattice built with squares @xcite and on the square lattice @xcite .    an alternative to the two - site interactions of the isaw model",
    "is to consider walks which may pass more than once through a lattice site , without any restriction on bonds , and associate a negative energy to multiply occupied sites .",
    "if up to @xmath2 monomers are allowed to occupy a site , we have the multiple monomer per site ( mms ) model proposed by krawczyk et al .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this model for @xmath7 on the square lattice suggest that it can display both continuous and discontinuous coil - globule transitions @xcite .",
    "however , exact solutions of the mms model on hierarchical lattices show that the collapse transition is always continuous , but its nature can be critical or tricritical , depending on the energies involved @xcite .",
    "if the configurations of the mms model are restricted such that each edge of the lattice is occupied at most by a single polymer bond , the resulting walks are called interacting self - avoiding trails ( isat ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ figwalks ] shows the differences among isaw , isat and mms chains .",
    "all saw s are valid configurations of isat s , and all isat s are allowed in the mms model , so that the models are in an order of increasing generalization .",
    "notice that the maximum number of monomers per site @xmath2 in the mms model can assume any value , while for isat this maximal number will be @xmath12 or @xmath13 for even or odd coordination number @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "it is apparent in the figures that in all models the chains are linear , that is , each monomer which is not an endpoint is bonded to two other monomers . nevertheless , the configurations of sat resemble the ones found in branched polymers ( bp ) , where a monomer may be bonded to more than two other monomers , which present rich phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "indeed , as will be discussed below , on the bethe lattice , bp with even ramification can be mapped on the isat model .",
    "when a site is visited more than once in the isat model , there will be multiple ways to connect the incoming bonds , as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ figwalks ] .",
    "if the trails are not allowed to cross themselves , we have the vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk ( visaw ) model proposed by blte and nienhuis ( bn ) @xcite , whose coil - globule transition in two dimensions is associated to a different tricritical point , with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this model presents a very rich phase diagram when the parameter space is increased by including stiffness @xcite , so that the chains are semi - flexible .",
    "in contrast , for the more general isat model , where the trails are allowed to cross themselves , there are no exact results and the nature of its collapse transition is a subject of long debate in literature : while some works present evidences of continuous collapse transition in bn @xcite or  undetermined \" @xcite universality classes , the possibility of a discontinuous transition was also suggested in @xcite .",
    "it seems to be no surprise that the inclusion of crossings in the bn model apparently makes it no longer exactly solvable and may lead to richer phase diagrams .",
    "for instance , if second neighbor ( diagonal ) interactions are introduced in the square lattice ising model , since the lattice become non - planar , no exact solutions are known and a quite rich phase diagram is found , including a critical line with continuously varying critical exponents @xcite .        in order to shed some light on these controversies , here we solve the isat model on bethe and husimi lattices considering that up to @xmath2 monomers can be placed on a site .",
    "rich grand - canonical phase diagrams are found with non - polymerized , regular polymerized and dense polymerized phases separated by critical and coexistence lines / surfaces . particularly for lattice coordination @xmath1 and @xmath5 , which is an approximation for the isat on the square lattice ,",
    "the solution on both lattices shows that the collapse transition is associated to a bicritical point . for the bethe lattice with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which mimics cubic or triangular lattices , two tricritical and",
    "two critical lines meeting at a multicritical point are found .",
    "the mapping of the phase diagrams in the canonical ensemble is discussed , as well as their similarities with numerical results for regular lattices .",
    "although of course solutions on hierarchical lattices are not suited to answer questions related to the universality class of phase transitions , since they lead to classical exponents , they may be useful to approximate the thermodynamic properties of the models , such as their phase diagrams and the nature of the phase transitions in the system .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ defmod ] , we define the model in more detail and present its solution on the bethe lattice in terms of recursion relations . the thermodynamic behavior of the model on this lattice is discussed in sec .",
    "the solution of the model on a four - coordinated husimi lattice is presented in section [ husimi ] .",
    "final discussions and conclusions may be found in sec .",
    "we consider interacting self - avoiding trails ( isat s ) on the bethe lattice ( the core of a cayley tree @xcite ) with arbitrary coordination number @xmath0 . in this model , at most one polymer bond can occupy a lattice edge .",
    "however , the lattice sites can be occupied by up to @xmath2 distinguishable monomers . a statistical weight @xmath15 is associated to each site with @xmath16 monomers . as usual , the endpoints of the walks are placed on the surface of the tree .",
    "the sites at the surface may be empty or have a monomer placed on them , and the statistical weights of these two configurations determine only the initial conditions of the solution of the model on treelike lattices in terms of recursion relations and , thus , they will have no influence on its thermodynamic behavior . the grand - canonical partition function of the model will be given by : @xmath17 where the sum is over all configurations of the walks on the tree , while @xmath18 is the number of sites visited @xmath16 times by the walks . in fig . [ figrede ] , an example of a cayley tree with three generations of sites is shown , with a particular configuration of isat s which contributes to the partition function . as already noted , the maximum number of monomers that can be placed on a site is limited by the lattice coordination , being @xmath19 or @xmath20 for even and odd @xmath0 s , respectively .     and 3 generations",
    ". the weight of this contribution will be @xmath21 .",
    "the endpoints of the walks are placed on the surface of the cayley tree.,width=226 ]    to solve the model on the bethe lattice we consider rooted subtrees , defining partial partition functions ( ppf s ) for them .",
    "a lattice edge may be empty or occupied by a trail , thus we define two ppf s @xmath22 and @xmath23 for empty and occupied root edges , respectively .",
    "considering the operation of attaching @xmath24 subtrees with a certain number of generations to a new root site and edge , we build a subtree with an additional generation .",
    "the recursion relations for the two ppf s are :    @xmath25    @xmath26    the first combinatorial factor in the expressions corresponds to the number of ways to choose the incoming bonds among the edges of the lattice , while the second term accounts for the number of ways to connect the incoming and the root bonds .",
    "these recursion relations , apart from the combinatorial factors , are identical to the ones obtained for branched polymers ( bp ) on the bethe lattice @xcite , with the difference that the statistical weights ( defined as @xmath27 there ) are associated to sites with @xmath16 branches . as basically the thermodynamic properties of the model",
    "are obtained from the recursion relations , both models have similar behaviors , with some changes of variables ( for even @xmath16 s ) . however , while banchio and serra @xcite restricted their analysis of the bp model for cases with two non - vanishing weights @xmath28 and @xmath27 only , here we will concentrate our attention mostly on the general case of the @xmath7 isat model with non - vanishing weights @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath6 , to compare with simulational results for isat s on the cubic and triangular lattices .",
    "usually , the partial partition functions diverge when the number @xmath32 of iterations ( generations of the subtree ) increases indefinitely .",
    "thus , it is appropriate to define the ratio of them @xmath33 , which is expected to remain finite in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath34 ) at least for some range of the weight parameters ( @xmath3 ) for which the density of empty sites on the lattice does not vanish .",
    "the recursion relation for the ratio is : @xmath35 the properties of the model in the thermodynamic limit will be defined by a stable fixed point of the recursion relation @xmath36 .",
    "the fixed point is linearly stable if @xmath37    the grand - canonical partition function of the model on the cayley tree may be obtained if we consider the operation of attaching @xmath0 subtrees to the central site of the lattice , in a similar way as we used to derive the recursion relations for the ppf s .",
    "the result is : @xmath38    the fraction of configurations with @xmath16 monomers on the central site of the tree , which corresponds to the bethe lattice result , is given by @xmath39 and the total density of monomers on the lattice is @xmath40    the free energy of the model on the bethe lattice is different from the one on the whole cayley tree , since the contribution of the surface sites is discarded .",
    "applying an ansatz proposed by gujrati @xcite , which may also be obtained considering the bulk and surface contributions to the free energy @xcite , the reduced free energy per site for the bethe lattice is : @xmath41 in the limit of @xmath42 .",

    "we see that , even on bethe lattice , these two models are not equivalent in general .",
    "when at most two monomers may occupy the same site , the fixed point equation for finite and non - vanishing values of the ratio @xmath54 is the biquadratic equation : @xmath74 for @xmath1 , the first coefficient vanishes and the polymerized fixed point is @xmath75 which admits real ( physical ) values only in the regions ( _ i _ ) @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and ( _ ii _ ) @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "for instance , for @xmath196 , which is the case always considered on regular lattices , beyond a non - polymerized ( np ) phase and a regular polymerized ( p ) phase , a stable dense polymerized ( dp ) phase may also exist . on the bethe lattice , in this phase all sites of the lattice",

    "this bicritical behavior is different from all previous conjectures about the isat collapse transition on the square lattice , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "it is important to recall that the same result has been found for the branched polymer ( bp ) model on the bethe lattice , but on a husimi lattice built with squares - which is a more realistic approximation to the square lattice - a different phase diagram was found , with the bicritical point given place to a critical endpoint and a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for the isat model on the husimi lattice built with squares we found a phase diagram very similar to the one for the bethe lattice ( fig . [ figw1w2k2q4 ] ) : the bicritical point is still present , and the only difference is the dense phase , which becomes a polymerized phase , but with asymmetric densities @xmath198 .",
    "this suggests that the collapse transition in the isat model on the square lattice may in fact be of bicritical nature .",
    "it is also important to note that these results for isat s are very different from the ones for the mms model ( with @xmath5 ) , where a tricritical point was found @xcite .",
    "this shows that the restriction in the bonds is more important to determine the thermodynamic behavior of isat than the multiple visit of sites .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath5 and @xmath93 , the critical p - np line ends at a tricritical point for the isat model , similarly to isaw and mms models .",
    "this may be compared with what happens for isaw s with interactions between bonds : on the @xmath1 husimi lattice the collapse transition is a critical endpoint , it becomes the usual tricritical point on a @xmath93 husimi tree .",
    "we have , however , not studied the present model on husimi trees with @xmath93 .",
    "considering @xmath6 and @xmath7 , a very rich phase diagram is found for bethe lattice , with two tricritical ( tc ) lines separating the critical and coexistence p - np and p - dp surfaces .",
    "moreover , two critical end - point ( cep ) lines are also present in the phase diagram , where the critical surfaces end .",
    "all these lines meet at a multicritical point ( mcp ) located at @xmath120 , @xmath143 .",
    "we recall that in the mms model ( with @xmath7 ) on the bethe lattice there is also a critical np - p surface limited by a tc line and a cep line , both meeting at a mcp @xcite . in the version of the model where immediate reversal of the walk is forbidden the mcp",
    "is located at @xmath199 @xcite , differing from the location in isat .",

    "@xcite , in the canonical situation , the polymer chain is placed on an ( effectively ) infinite lattice , so the polymer ( a polymerized phase ) exists together with the empty lattice ( a non - polymerized phase ) .",
    "therefore , this corresponds to the surfaces limiting the np phase in our diagrams .",
    "moreover , identifying @xmath29 as the fugacity of the monomers , we must have @xmath200 and @xmath201 , so that @xmath202 $ ] and @xmath203 $ ] are the canonical variables .",
    "figure [ figdiagcanonico](a ) shows the canonical diagram for @xmath1 and @xmath5 and , as expected , increasing @xmath204 a collapse transition takes place at the bicritical point .",
    "however , for @xmath205 , instead of a globule ( liquid - like ) phase ( due to a np - p coexistence ) , we have found a dense ( crystal - like ) phase ( due to a np - dp coexistence ) .",
    "a dense phase has also been found in recent studies on generalized isat models on regular lattices @xcite and is usually called a crystal phase .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the origin of the difference in isaw and isat models in the square lattice is the nature of their collapsed phases , which is liquid - like ( globule ) in the former and solid - like ( crystal ) in the last one .",
    "noteworthy , the bicritical point is located at @xmath206 in striking agreement with the expected value for the collapse transition of the isat model on the square lattice @xcite .    the canonical diagram for @xmath6 and @xmath7 is depicted in fig .",

    "doukas et al .",
    "@xcite considered an extended isat model on the triangular lattice , where weights @xmath30 and @xmath31 were associated to double and triple visited sites .",
    "the canonical phase diagram they found , through monte carlo simulations ( see fig . 22 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is qualitatively equal to the ours ( fig . [ figdiagcanonico](b ) ) , with the coil , globule and crystal phases and their respective transitions lines meeting at a multicritical point .",
    "the coil - globule transition was found to be continuous and belonging to the @xmath8 class , a continuous globule - crystal line is also found , in accordance with our findings .",
    "however , the coil - crystal transition is claimed to be first - order , while we have found a cep line .",
    "interestingly , a similar difference has been observed in the phase diagram of the mms model , where a cep line was found in the bethe lattice solution @xcite and a first - order transition was suggested by monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "anyway , it is very interesting that comparing our results with the simulational findings by doukas et al .",
    "@xcite , we find that the locations for the multicritical point coincide . this quantitative agreement between solutions on hierarchical lattices and simulations is very rare and ,",
    "as far as we known , it has been observed only in lattice gas systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent simulations of this generalized isat model on the cubic lattice showed that a dense phase does not exist in this case and , thus , a very different phase diagram is found @xcite .",
    "this suggests that while our solution yields results reliable for the triangular lattice , it is not the case for the cubic one .",
    "therefore , improved approximations , for example , solving the model on husimi lattices built with cubes or triangles , are desirable to further study if this difference is found also on hierarchical lattices .",
