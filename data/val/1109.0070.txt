    "in galaxy clusters , the presence of relativistic electrons with energies of around gev has been implied by radio synchrotron emissions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although some possible acceleration mechanisms for those relativistic electrons have been proposed , they are still controversial topics ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the diffuse radio emissions in galaxy clusters are categorized into several types such as jet robes from active galactic nuclei , radio halos located at the center of galaxy clusters , and radio relics located at the cluster periphery . in particular",
    ", the origin of radio relics has been a major mystery .",
    "recent observations suggest that they are associated with large - scale shocks which are also thought to be possible sources of the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays above @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the existence of shocks in the radio relic implies that the high - energy electrons are most likely produced through the diffusive shock acceleration process @xcite .",
    "in fact , radio shells showing the spectral softening due to the synchrotron and the inverse compton coolings are observed in ciza  j2242.8 + 5301 @xcite , while a temperature jump is found in a3667 @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that the temperature is @xmath1 , the magnetic - field strength @xmath2 , and the mach number @xmath3 for ciza  j2242.8 + 5301 , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the number density is @xmath7 for a3667 . according to the standard theory of structure formation",
    ", galaxy clusters result from mergers of smaller structures .",
    "high mach number shocks ( @xmath8 ) are formed in accreting small halos and around the virialized core of the galaxy cluster .",
    "they can accelerate cosmic rays to ultra - high energies with harder energy spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , low mach number shocks ( @xmath9 ) are formed in the virialized core . during the mergers and accretions ,",
    "the most kinetic energy of the accreting matter is dissipated by relatively low mach number shocks with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these shocks with @xmath11 are needed in order to explain spectral indices of the radio relic @xcite .",
    "in fact , the shock velocity in the radio relic of the galaxy cluster is of the order of @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 and the corresponding mach numbers are about @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the shock velocity is similar to what is observed for young supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks which generate galactic cosmic - ray electrons @xcite as well as nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the mach number of a galaxy cluster shock is much smaller than that of a snr shock because of high upstream temperature as well as the so - called magnetization parameter , @xmath15 . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 denote upstream magnetic field , plasma density , electron rest mass , and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "then , for the galaxy clusters , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "such small values of mach numbers are of the same order as those of the shocks observed in the heliosphere , i.e. the terrestrial bow shock and interplanetary shocks in which electron acceleration is rarely observed @xcite .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration is one of the most plausible acceleration mechanisms of charged particles at a shock front ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a resultant energy spectrum of the high - energy particles obeys a power law . for snr shocks , galactic cosmic rays",
    "are thought to be accelerated through this process .",
    "it is not resolved , however , how a part of particles originally composing a thermal background plasma is embedded in the diffusive shock acceleration which requires pre - existence of nonthermal particles possible to flow freely over the shock .",
    "this is the so - called injection problem on the diffusive shock acceleration . in general ,",
    "electron injection is thought to be more difficult than ion injection because of cross - shock potential .",
    "nevertheless , relativistic electrons are believed to be accelerated in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "although a variety of theoretical as well as simulation studies have revealed that microinstabilities in the shock transition region play some crucial roles , the electron injection process even in extremely high - mach number shocks has not yet been understood completely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the above context , electron injection in low mach number shocks",
    "is inferred to be even harder , since the free energy for microinstabilities in the shock transition region should be much smaller than that in high mach number shocks .",
    "although a variety of microinstabilities get excited in some heliospheric shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is known , for instance , that the saturation level of the modified two - stream instability which is one of the most plausible instabilities in shocks observed near the earth is not so high as that of the buneman instability in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "given this perspective , an injection process of electrons in the galaxy cluster shocks is veiled in mystery .",
    "indeed , this problem has never been addressed so far . here , we take notice that upstream temperature of the cluster shocks is much higher than those of snr and heliospheric shocks . as can be seen in the next section , the high upstream temperature enables some electrons to be accelerated to relativistic energies via the so - called shock drift acceleration ( sda ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a limiting case of the electron sda and associated microprocesses which may be responsible for the injection of electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration in the galaxy cluster shocks . in section  2 ,",
    "the sda process is briefly reviewed and extended to an extreme case .",
    "simulation settings and results are shown in section  3 .",
    "then , discussions and summary are given in section  4 .",
    "shock drift acceleration ( sda ) is one of the efficient acceleration mechanisms of charged particles in the transition region of an oblique collisionless shock .",
    "the motion of non - relativistic electrons in this process is analyzed in detail previously ( eg . @xcite ) . in the so - called normal incidence frame ( nif ) , where upstream flow direction is parallel to a shock normal , the acceleration occurs while an electron stays in the shock transition region and drifts along the shock surface due to finite gradient of magnetic field strength .",
    "the electron gains energy since the direction of the drift motion is anti - parallel to the motional electric field .",
    "assuming that the coplanar magnetic field for a one - dimensional shock is in the @xmath22 plane and the shock normal is along the @xmath23-axis leads to @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the lorentz factor , momentum , velocity and elementary charge , @xmath27 electric field , and the dots denote time derivative , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 has been used , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote shock potential and the motional electric field .",
    "this results in @xmath31 some incoming electrons gain significant energy during the drift motion and are reflected backward from the shock . these reflected electrons become a non - thermal component in the upstream plasma frame .",
    "the reflection occurs due to the magnetic mirror effect .",
    "the de hoffmann - teller frame ( htf ) where upstream flow is along the magnetic field is convenient to consider motion of a particle , because the motional electric field disappears in this frame .",
    "the particle velocity in the htf ( @xmath32 ) and the nif ( @xmath33 ) are related as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the de hoffmann - teller velocity , @xmath36 is the unit vector normal to the shock , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are upstream flow velocity and the magnetic field in the nif , respectively . in the htf the right hand side of equation ( [ p_ene ] )",
    "becomes zero so that @xmath39 is conserved .",
    "moreover , if the motion of the electron is assumed to be adiabatic , magnetic moment , @xmath40 , is also conserved . here",
    ", the prime denotes a quantity measured in the htf .",
    "this assumption is valid while the spatial scale of a shock transition region is sufficiently larger than the larmor radius of the electron .",
    "from these two restrictions , in order for the electron to be mirror reflected , the initial pitch angle , @xmath41 , should satisfy the following condition ( cf .",
    "@xcite for nonrelativistic version ) .",
    "@xmath42 here , @xmath43 denotes magnetic field strength , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate upstream ( initial ) and downstream quantities , respectively .",
    "if there exists an overshoot , however , @xmath46 and @xmath47 should be defined there .",
    "the energy gain in the sda process is obtained by integrating equation ( [ p_ene ] ) in the nif , @xmath48 , as the energy gained by an electron during its drift in the transition region along the direction anti - parallel to the motional electric field ( for details to @xcite ) .",
    "if one moves in the htf , the energy gain is explained by the well known fermi acceleration mechanism @xcite . if a particle velocity before reflected is written as @xmath49 , @xmath50 . after being reflected ,",
    "the parallel velocity is reversed so that @xmath51",
    ". then , moving back in the nif results in @xmath52 .",
    "now , @xmath53 when @xmath54 and @xmath36 is along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "hence , the acceleration occurs mainly in @xmath55-direction .",
    "the more @xmath56 increases , the larger energy gain of the particle becomes . according to @xcite , the acceleration time through",
    "this process is typically of the order of an ion gyro period , @xmath57 , which will also be confirmed in our simulation later . for typical intra - cluster magnetic field of @xmath58",
    ", this corresponds to about a few 100 seconds , which is of course much shorter than any time scales of incoherent loss processes .",
    "if @xmath59 is assumed , @xmath60 is the necessary condition for an electron to be reflected .",
    "when a magnetic overshoot is neglected for simplicity , @xmath46 or the critical pitch angle called a loss - cone angle , @xmath61 , can be determined from the rankine - hugoniot relation by giving a mach number ( @xmath62 ) , an upstream plasma beta ( @xmath63 ) , and a shock angle ( @xmath64 ) which is an angle between the shock normal and upstream magnetic field @xcite .",
    "top two panels in figure [ p_space ] show regions in @xmath65 parameter space where some electrons on a velocity shell with a radius of @xmath66 in an upstream plasma frame of the nif can be reflected , where @xmath67 is upstream electron thermal velocity . in the two panels , for instance , in the black area",
    "some electrons on such a velocity shell corresponding to upstream electron beta ( @xmath68 ) being equal to 0.1 satisfy the condition @xmath69 , where @xmath70 has been assumed to calculate @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , in the dark ( light ) gray area some electrons can be additionally reflected by assuming @xmath71 .",
    "the top ( middle ) panel corresponds to the case with @xmath72 .",
    "the figure confirms that electrons are hardly reflected when @xmath62 and/or @xmath64 become too large .",
    "this may be graphically understood as follows .",
    "suppose a velocity shell in @xmath73 space indicated as the broken circle in the bottom panel .",
    "its center corresponds to the bulk velocity of the upstream plasma in the nif , ( @xmath74 ) , and the radius of the shell is @xmath75 .",
    "let us consider whether some electrons on this velocity shell is mirror reflected or not ( in this schematic picture relativistic distortion of the shell has been neglected . ) . if @xmath56 is added in @xmath76 , the center of the shell shifts along the thick gray vertical arrow .",
    "now a broken line connecting the origin with the new center of the shell is parallel to an upstream bulk velocity in the htf which is along the upstream magnetic field , @xmath38 .",
    "two solid lines symmetrical with respect to the broken line denote a loss - cone .",
    "therefore , the electrons outside this loss - cone indicated by the black solid arcs can be reflected , otherwise transmit .",
    "when @xmath77 or a mach number increases , the center of the shell shifts along the broken line and finally a whole shell lies inside the loss - cone . in this case",
    "no electrons are reflected .",
    "similarly , when @xmath64 becomes large , the broken line gets more vertical and the center of the shell walks away from the origin .",
    "then the whole shell again enters a loss - cone .",
    "the possible reflection area indicated in the top two panels are defined like this by assuming the shell radius @xmath78 .",
    "the area expands with increasing @xmath79 as expected . on the other hand",
    ", it does not depend much on @xmath80 .",
    "in particular when @xmath81 , distributions of the areas are almost exactly the same as the top panel .",
    "it is mainly due to the light speed limit of a shell radius that the areas look contracted for @xmath82 in the middle panel , because the increasing @xmath80 with constant @xmath79 results in increase of the thermal velocity .",
    "( the actual calculation is performed by taking relativistic effects into account so that the shell is given in momentum space with @xmath83 . ) .",
    "it is speculated that in extremely high mach number shocks like a snr shock whose mach number is typically @xmath84 electron reflection hardly occurs unless there are no preheating mechanisms as discussed by @xcite . on the other hand , electrons",
    "can be relatively easily reflected when @xmath85 , although acceleration may be weak because of small @xmath56 . in practice",
    ", one should note that finite shock potential may reduce the reflection rate @xcite .      as mentioned above , in low mach number shocks ( @xmath85 ) electrons",
    "are relatively easily reflected , although the resultant acceleration is not so efficient in general .",
    "however , if there are some electrons on the velocity shell with sufficiently large @xmath75 , they may be reflected even at large @xmath64 where @xmath86 .",
    "the reflected electron energy in such a case would become relativistic .",
    "a condition that an upstream electron on a velocity shell with radius @xmath87 can be reflected is @xmath88 when @xmath89 , this leads to @xmath90 , where effects of shock potential has been again neglected .",
    "if @xmath91 , the following condition is finally obtained : @xmath92 the inequality ( [ eta ] ) implies that reflected electrons can be present if there are some electrons on a velocity shell with @xmath93 .",
    "the reflected electrons will have relativistic energies when @xmath94 . in this limit @xmath95 , where @xmath96 in the solar wind or interstellar plasmas @xmath97 is extremely large , since electron temperature is @xmath98 ev at the highest and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "therefore , satisfaction of the above condition for a shock in such an environment as in the earth s bow shock or snr shocks is almost hopeless",
    ". however , that may be possible if the electron temperature becomes @xmath101 a few@xmath102 kev or @xmath103 and @xmath104 as in some large - scale shocks in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "in this section one - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation is performed to reproduce relativistic sda of electrons discussed above in a self - consistent manner .    in the simulation",
    "a shock is produced by the so - called injection or reflecting wall method .",
    "an upstream magnetized plasma is continuously injected from the left - hand boundary .",
    "the plasma is reflected at the right - hand boundary and mixture of the incoming and the reflected plasmas results in a downstream medium .",
    "the shock is produced at a boundary between the upstream and the downstream plasmas . since the simulation frame is the downstream rest frame , the shock propagates in time from right to left .",
    "the simulation is done in the nif so that the injection flow is parallel to the shock normal which is along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "the upstream magnetic field is in the @xmath22 plane .",

    "time resolution is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "other physical parameters are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "for runs a - c , all injection parameters are common except for the shock angle , @xmath64 .",

    "this value roughly corresponds to the fast mach number @xmath113 by using a definition of ion acoustic velocity as @xmath114 .",
    "the magnetization parameter is @xmath115 and the plasma beta is @xmath116 so that the upstream electron temperature is @xmath117 kev .",
    "an ion - to - electron mass ratio @xmath118 is realistic . in the last two columns the maximum value of the magnetic field roughly measured in the overshoot relative to the upstream value , @xmath119 , and associated @xmath120 calculated from equation ( [ eta ] ) are denoted for reference .",
    "note that @xmath120 may in fact be larger if non - negligible potential effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "most efficient electron acceleration is observed in run a as expected from that @xmath121 is the largest , although in all cases reflected electrons are seen .",
    "run d is performed with more realistic parameters where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are reduced .",
    "the results of run d are essentially the same as those of run a and discussed in section 4 . in the following , results of run a are focused .",
    ".[table1]shock parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in fig.[xt ] spatio - temporal evolutions of @xmath124 and @xmath125 fields are shown in the left panels .",
    "structure of the shock is more or less time stationary , although it represents weak breathing features @xcite .",

    "the time the electron stays in the transition region during the reflection process is @xmath57 .",
    "these are typical features of sda discussed by @xcite and @xcite , while energy of the reflected electron here becomes relativistic .",

    "they are produced in the second and the third magnetic overshoots at @xmath138 and 14 seen in fig.[xt ] . by comparing the upstream and the downstream energy distribution functions ,",
    "the highest energy electron is upstream .",
    "this implies that in the simulation the downstream region is still very limited to see an equilibrium state and that is clear also from the top three panels .",
    "it is often thought that reflected electrons produce a loss - cone distribution because of their adiabatic behaviors @xcite .",
    "however , no clear loss - cone is seen in the fourth panel .",
    "this is probably due to the effects of small - scale waves generated in the transition region .",

    "they appear in the lower panel as spectral peaks between @xmath141 where @xmath142 denotes the electron inertial length .",
    "corresponding structures are also seen in ion @xmath143 phase space indicating that reflected ions destabilize some kind of microinstability ( although not shown ) .      here , some possible behaviors of the accelerated electrons after being reflected are discussed . since the reflected electrons form the non - equilibrium distribution function , some local instabilities may be driven .",
    "however , they may not have been properly treated in the previous section , because there wave vectors only along the @xmath23-axis are allowed . in the following possible instabilities and associated wave - particle interactions are discussed by performing further one - dimensional simulations for various wave propagation angles with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "although the electron distribution function forms a plateau in @xmath169 in the end of the run as seen in the bottom panel , the temperature anisotropy still persists ( second panel ) .",
    "because of the small electromagnetic field energies throughout the run ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 field energies are in the noise level . ) , the above process is essentially electrostatic .",
    "electrostatic wave activities are again dominant for @xmath172 , although their intensity is much less than the case with @xmath167 ( not shown ) .    in contrast , electromagnetic fluctuations become predominant for @xmath173 . the similar plot as fig.[th00 ] for @xmath158 is shown in fig.[th60 ] , although the third panel is @xmath164 spectrum of @xmath139 field for @xmath174 .",

    "they roughly coincide with the values derived from the above estimate , @xmath1019.6 , @xmath1013.6 , and @xmath1012.3 , where @xmath191 ( at a maximum ) and @xmath192 are again from the simulation .",
    "possible reasons for the underestimate may be neglecting a temporal variation of the shock velocity and/or nonadiabatic features based on the small scale waves in the transition region .",
    "the parameter dependence of the maximum attainable energy through the sda is shown in fig.[emax ] .",
    "energies of the reflected particles along the edges of the possible reflection areas in the top two panels in fig.[p_space ] are plotted .",
    "each line color corresponds to different @xmath79 ( black : 0.1 , dark gray : 0.5 , light gray : 1.5 ) .",
    "the upper panels show energies of the reflected electrons normalized to upstream electron bulk flow energies .",
    "the dashed lines denote bulk energy of the ion flow .",
    "the normalized energies indicate apparent @xmath193 dependence for wide range of @xmath62 .",
    "this is consistent with the result that the obtained energies do not basically depend on @xmath62 as confirmed in the lower panels .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath56 is roughly constant along the edges of the possible reflection area .",
    "however , the maximum energy strongly depends on @xmath80 implying that the magnetic field strength is crucial .",
    "indeed , it should be noted that the vertical axes in the lower right panel is three orders of magnitude larger than those in the lower left panel , while a ratio of @xmath80 between these two panels is also @xmath194 .",
    "the reflected electrons are accelerated mainly in @xmath55-direction which is almost along the magnetic field , forming the nonthermal part of the energy distribution function upstream of the shock .",
    "the efficiency of the energy transfer to the reflected electrons is highest in run a. if an injection rate , @xmath134 , is defined as the fraction of energy density carried by the reflected electrons with respect to the bulk energy density of the incoming ions , @xmath195 in this case .",
    "the corresponding relative number density of the reflected electrons , or a reflection ratio , is 2.6% .",
    "these values are to be compared with observations .",
    "@xcite estimated the total energy of radio - emitting electrons in the radio relic in a3667 is @xmath196 of the shock kinetic energy , where they adopt the field strength @xmath197 g to explain dim inverse compton emission in the x - ray band .",
    "another observational estimation of the injection efficiency is obtained assuming the equipartition between the energies of the magnetic field and the radio emitting electrons . using the observed quantities given in @xcite",
    ", we derive @xmath198 of the shock kinetic energy goes into that of radio emitting electrons .",
    "the injection efficiency of a few percent obtained by our simulation result is comparable to the observational estimation ( 0.1 - 4% ) , which , however , contains various uncertainties .",
    "it should be noted that the result here is originated from the one - dimensional simulations only for the particular parameter set , and that the injection efficiency depends on various parameters such as the electron temperature , the shock normal angle , etc . to estimate the injection efficiency more accurately",
    ", we should perform detailed survey on parameters as well as two or three dimensional simulations which will be addressed in future works .",
    "the accelerated relativistic reflected electrons form a non - equilibrium local ring - beam like distribution function upstream of the shock .",
    "this is possible to generate large amplitude waves through a variety of microinstabilities .",
    "local simulations with periodic boundary conditions reveal that the electrostatic electron beam instability is rapidly destabilized basically along the magnetic field .",
    "this instability quickly saturates by forming a plateau of the distribution function so that the effective temperature anisotropy ( @xmath199 ) remains .",
    "afterwards , the oblique nonresonant instability grows slowly leading to efficient relaxation of the temperature anisotropy . in this process",
    "some of the reflected electrons are scattered back toward the shock by self - generated coherent wave packets . a sequence of the above process",
    ", i.e. , the reflection of some incoming electrons through the sda process followed by excitation of the microinstabilities and the backscattering of a part of the reflected electrons by the self - generated waves , may be the first step of injection into the diffusive shock acceleration process .",
    "in runs a , b , and c , @xmath62 and @xmath200 may be somewhat higher than those of typical large - scale shocks in galaxy clusters .",
    "therefore , an additional run d is performed to confirm that the similar process can work also for more realistic parameters . here , @xmath201 kev , and @xmath202 as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "results are qualitatively similar to run a. the relativistic sda works and associated ring - beam electrons are produced upstream . however , the maximum lorentz factor of the reflected electrons , @xmath203 , is not as large as in run a , since @xmath56 and the initial @xmath187 are a little less because of the small @xmath62 and @xmath200 here ( fig.[rund ] ) .",
    "in addition , a reflection rate of the incoming electrons becomes smaller , because @xmath204 which is larger than @xmath205 in run a. nevertheless , the relativistic sda can work in such a parameter regime too . in practice",
    "the process may occur even for more moderate and lower temperature shocks if a halo electron component is present in an intra - cluster medium as in the solar wind @xcite .    in the present paper effects of higher spatial dimensions",
    "have been excluded .",
    "we expect that the processes discussed separately in sections 3.1 and 3.2 are simultaneously observed in 2d or 3d systems .",
    "however , details of the competing processes among them have been unknown .",
    "for example , the electron beam instability is accompanied by pitch angle scattering through multidimensional wave - particle interactions in its nonlinear stage ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this process proceeds more rapidly than the growth of the oblique nonresonant instability , the relaxation of the effective temperature anisotropy and associated backscattering of a part of the reflected electrons might occur through this .",
    "it is also curious to know some other effects like a rippling and upstream turbulence .",
    "all these are the future issues .",
    "we should like to thank hiroki  akamatsu and susumu  inoue for useful comments and discussions .",

    "<S> an extreme case of electron shock drift acceleration in low mach number collisionless shocks is investigated as a plausible mechanism of initial acceleration of relativistic electrons in large - scale shocks in galaxy clusters where upstream plasma temperature is of the order of 10 kev and a degree of magnetization is not too small . </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional electromagnetic full particle simulations reveal that , even though a shock is rather moderate , a part of thermal incoming electrons are accelerated and reflected through relativistic shock drift acceleration and form a local nonthermal population just upstream of the shock . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerated electrons can self - generate local coherent waves and further be back - scattered toward the shock by those waves . </S>",
    "<S> this may be a scenario for the first stage of the electron shock acceleration occurring at the large - scale shocks in galaxy clusters such as ciza j2242.8 + 5301 which has well defined radio relics . </S>"
