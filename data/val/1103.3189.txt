    "it is as well theoretically proven as experimentally tested that the exploitation of entangled states improves our ability to manage information in several ways @xcite .",
    "the development of quantum information theory is definitely due to this fundamental result @xcite .",
    "however , it has been recently discovered that even multipartite separable states can play a relevant role in performing better - than - classical communication and information protocols @xcite . in general , then , the usefulness of a particular state of a quantum system for such tasks can be traced back to the presence of internal correlations among parts of the system , i.e. , to the knowledge that an observer alice , probing a subsystem @xmath1 , gains about the state of another subsystem @xmath2 , controlled by another observer bob , and vice versa .    the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of such correlations and the proper discrimination of their nature  classical versus quantum  stand as open problems .",
    "several quantifiers of non - classicality of correlations have been introduced in literature @xcite ( not to be confused with the non - classicality of quantum optical states @xcite ) , but there are still neither clear criteria of faithfulness or _ bona - fide_-ness for them , nor a well established hierarchy of reliability . in spite of that",
    ", they are heavily used in current research @xcite .",
    "the most popular one is by far the _ quantum discord _",
    "@xcite , a measure of non  classical correlations which goes beyond entanglement and whose definition has an immediate interpretation in information theory : discord equals the difference of the total correlations between two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 before and after a local measurement process is performed on one of them .",
    "the quantum discord admits at least three other operational interpretations , in contexts ranging from thermodynamics to communication protocols , such as the quantum state merging @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the quantum discord is a hard task from a computational point of view , implying an optimization of the conditional entropy between alice and bob , @xmath3 , over all local ( generalized ) measurements on one party , which is often obtainable by numerical methods only .",
    "a closed analytical solution is known in the case of arbitrary two  mode gaussian states @xcite , under the restriction of gaussian local measurements . narrowing our overview to two ",
    "qubit states , an analytical expression of discord has been derived in particular for the subclass of so - called @xmath0states @xcite , and a successful attempt to generalize this procedure has not been advanced yet ( to the best of our knowledge ) , apart from an upper bound quantity for the discord defined in @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in calculating quantum discord motivated the introduction of alternative measures of non - classical correlations .",
    "in particular , the _ geometric discord _",
    "@xcite is one such a measure , which quantifies the amount of non - classical correlations of a state in terms of its minimal distance from the set of genuinely classical states .",
    "the geometric discord involves a simpler optimization and is easily computable analytically for general two  qubit states .",
    "however , its relationship with the original quantum discord is not entirely clear at the present stage .    in this work",
    ", we present an algorithm to calculate quantum discord for general two  qubit states .",
    "first , we obtain an explicit and simplified expression for the conditional entropy , exploiting the bloch representation of the density matrix ; then , we employ new variables that allow us to set the optimization conditions in a closed form . finally , we associate them to constraints over the eigenvalues of the statistical ensemble obtained after the measurement process .",
    "our approach qualifies as the most efficient and reliable way to evaluate quantum discord for arbitrary states of two qubits @xcite .    exploiting our algorithm",
    ", we perform a detailed numerical exploration of the hilbert space of two  qubit states to compare quantum discord and the geometric discord as quantifiers of non - classical correlations .",
    "we shed light on the relationship between these two quantities by identifying the states that extremize geometric discord at fixed quantum discord ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we are motivated by the aim of establishing a reliable hierarchy of non - classical states based on physically and mathematically consistent criteria .",
    "we find that , interestingly , the quantum discord of a two  qubit state can never exceed its ( normalized ) geometric discord .",
    "in analogy with the study of maximal entanglement @xcite , we find that the notion of maximal non - classical correlations is measure  dependent : therefore , the feasibility in a specific experimental realization will determine which , among the various classes of maximally quantumly correlated states , are the most suitable ones to be employed for applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec1 ] provides an introduction to quantum discord and geometric discord ( hereafter denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) , presenting definitions , main properties and a summary of the results obtained in the literature . in section [ sec2 ] , we pursue an analytical approach to the calculation of quantum discord for general two  qubit states , eventually recasting the optimization problem into a system of two transcendental equations , whose solution specifies the local measurement that minimizes the conditional entropy .",
    "section [ sec3 ] concerns the comparison between quantum discord and geometric discord by using the results of the previous sections ; we identify the classes of states with maximal and minimal geometric discord at fixed quantum discord .",
    "finally , section [ sec4 ] recalls the main results of our work and suggests further issues worthy of investigation .",
    "one of the lessons we can apprehend from quantum mechanics is that the measurement process disturbs the state in which a physical system is set .",
    "this differs from what happens in the classical scenario , hence it is possible to conclude that the disturbance induced by a measurement on a state is a good evidence of its `` quantumness '' .",
    "now , let us suppose to have a bipartite system in a certain state and make a measurement on one of its subsystems .",
    "we can analyze the nature of the internal correlations of the system in such a state by studying in which way they are affected by the measurement .",
    "information theory provides the tools to accomplish this task .    as a starting point ,",
    "let us consider the case of information stored in two classical probability distributions .",
    "the quantity expressing the total amount of correlations between two random variables @xmath0 and @xmath6 , assuming values @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 , is the _ mutual information _",
    "@xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the shannon entropy associated to the random variable @xmath0 ; consequently @xmath12 is the entropy for @xmath6 while @xmath13 is the joint entropy of @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "following bayesian rules , we can retrieve equivalent formulations , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 here the conditional entropy is straightforwardly defined as @xmath16 , and represents how much uncertainty ( ignorance ) we have on @xmath0 given the value of @xmath6 ( and vice versa for @xmath17 ) .    in the quantum scenario",
    ", we consider a bipartite system @xmath18 described by a density matrix @xmath19 , and subsystems @xmath20 with marginal density matrices @xmath21 .",
    "the mutual information can be used once more to quantify the total correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum analogue of the expression ( [ ixy ] ) straightforwardly reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of subsystem @xmath1 , and equivalently @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if we try to define a quantum version of @xmath26 we have @xmath27 which is an `` ambiguous '' quantity @xcite , since the conditional quantum entropy @xmath3 is clearly depending on which observable we have measured on @xmath2 . using the same notation of @xcite , we recall that a von neumann measurement ( from now on just measurement ) on @xmath2 projects the system into a statistical ensemble @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 where @xmath30 \\\\\\nonumber   p_{bk}&=&v \\pi _",
    "k v^\\dagger\\\\ \\nonumber \\pi _ k & = & |k \\rangle\\langle k|,\\",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remind that in this case study the use of generalized positive - operator - valued - measurements ( povms ) is not required , since it has been proven in @xcite that for two  qubit states the optimal measurement for the conditional entropy is always a projective one .",
    "we can say that the amount of truly classical correlations is expressed by the mutual information obtained adopting the least disturbing measurement @xcite : @xmath31 consequently , the amount of genuinely quantum correlations , called _ quantum discord _ , is given by @xcite @xmath32 we note that quantum discord is not symmetric : @xmath33 performing the measurement on alice s subsystem rather than on bob s one is perfectly legitimate , but it returns in general a different value of discord .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a discussion about the implications of it .",
    "it is immediate to verify that not only entangled states , but almost all separable states have a non  vanishing quantum discord @xcite , i.e. are affected by the measurement process , thus exhibiting some pretty quantum properties . in the case of pure bipartite states , the discord reduces to the marginal entropy of one of the two subsystems and therefore to the canonical measure of entanglement .",
    "quantum discord for two  qubit states is normalized to one .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the experienced difficulty of calculating quantum discord can be coped , for a general two  qubit state , with the introduction of its geometrized version , hereby just called _ geometric discord _ @xcite .",
    "+ let us suppose , to be coherent with section [ secqd ] , to have a bipartite system @xmath18 and to make a measurement on @xmath2 .",
    "as we have remarked , almost all ( entangled or separable ) states are disturbed by the measurement ; however , there is a subclass of states which is invariant and presents zero discord .",
    "it is the class of the so  called _ classical  quantum _ states @xcite , whose elements have a density matrix of this form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a probability distribution , @xmath36 is the marginal density matrix of @xmath1 and @xmath37 is an orthonormal vector set .",
    "a classical  quantum state is not affected by a measurement on @xmath2 in any case .",
    "letting @xmath38 be the set of classical  quantum two  qubit states , and @xmath39 be a generic element of this set , the geometric discord @xmath5 is defined as the distance between the state @xmath40 and the closest classical  quantum state . in the original definition @xcite , the ( squared ) hilbert ",
    "schmidt distance is adopted . recalling that @xmath41 $ ] is the square of the hilbert ",
    "schmidt norm of a matrix @xmath1 , the geometric discord has been introduced as @xmath42    it is possible to obtain an explicit closed expression of @xmath5 for two  qubit states .",
    "first , one needs to express the @xmath43 density matrix of a two  qubit state in the so ",

    "then , it is shown in @xcite that the geometric discord is given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath54 ( in case of measurement on alice , one needs to replace @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 ) .",
    "an alternative formulation for the geometric discord has been provided in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath5 is not normalized to one : its maximum value is @xmath59 for two  qubit states , so it is natural to consider @xmath60 as a proper measure for a comparison with the quantum discord @xmath4 .",
    "even though quantum discord has an apparently simple definition @xcite , the practice reveals that its explicit evaluation is hard to accomplish . in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to two  qubit states .",
    "an analytical algorithm has been proposed for the subclass of states with maximally mixed marginals ( described by five real parameters ) in @xcite .",
    "also , an extension to states spanned by seven real parameters , called @xmath0states because of the peculiar form of their density matrix ( with vanishing elements outside the leading diagonal and the antidiagonal ) , has been introduced in @xcite , and amended by @xcite . here ,",
    "we attempt to generalize the procedure to the entire class of two  qubit states .",
    "first , we consider that performing local unitary transformations we can recast the density matrix for an arbitrary two  qubit state , eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) , in the bloch normal form @xcite @xmath61 that is a density matrix completely defined by nine real parameters arranged in three @xmath62-dimensional column vectors @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this follows from the fact that local unitary operations @xmath66 correspond to left and right multiplication of the bloch matrix @xmath67 with orthogonal matrices @xcite , @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain the normal form of eq .",
    "( [ simpler ] ) : one needs to calculate the singular value decomposition of the lower diagonal @xmath70 block @xmath51 of @xmath67 , @xmath71 , divide @xmath72 and @xmath73 by their respective determinant ( to make sure they both have determinant @xmath74 ) , and then apply eq .",

    "every two  qubit state can be then transformed in its simplified normal form by means of local unitaries ( which preserve entanglement and correlations in general , by definition ) , so we can restrict our analysis to density matrices of this type without incurring in any loss of generality .",
    "now , we move to calculate the quantum discord @xmath4 , eq .",
    "( [ discord ] ) , for generic states in normal form .",
    "the marginal entropy @xmath77 and the global entropy @xmath78 are trivial to obtain .",
    "the main issue regards the optimization involved in the conditional entropy .",
    "firstly , we have to write the conditional entropy in an explicit form , adopting for simplicity the notation in @xcite .",
