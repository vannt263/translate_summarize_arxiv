    "intermittency , the inherent inhomogeneity of turbulence , causes energy dissipation to be highly localized in space and in time .",
    "spatial intermittency is manifest by coherent structures , while temporal intermittency is characterized by irregular , bursty events .",
    "both of these phenomena are related , play key roles in the turbulent dynamics , and have important observational consequences . as with any dynamical physics problem , a complete understanding of intermittency can only be claimed when the solution is described in both the spatial and the temporal dimensions .",
    "intermittency is a challenging theoretical problem that impedes our progress toward a complete theory of turbulence .",
    "many of the methods used to study turbulence , such as energy spectra and correlation functions , are insensitive to intermittency .",
    "the methods conventionally employed to measure intermittency include structure functions @xcite , scale - dependent kurtosis @xcite , topological methods @xcite , and statistics of discontinuities @xcite ; however , these often give incomplete information or are difficult to measure accurately @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to better guide theoretical models of turbulence , it is essential to develop new tools for studying intermittency in a robust and informative manner .",
    "the statistical analysis of coherent structures is a possible route forward in this direction .",
    "it is convenient , for both practical and theoretical purposes , to treat coherent structures as discrete objects due to their localized nature and their central role in the dynamics .",
    "the statistical properties of these structures , including their intensities and morphologies , give insight into the underlying dynamics from which they formed .",
    "this information reveals the anisotropy , inhomogeneity , and characteristic scales of the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , such an analysis can be extended beyond simulations and theory , being well suited for a variety of experimental and observational applications , including solar flares , the solar photosphere @xcite , the interstellar medium @xcite , instabilities in fusion devices @xcite , and radiative signatures in optically thin astrophysical plasmas , e.g. , in black - hole accretion disk coronae @xcite , hot accretion flows @xcite , jets @xcite , pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hot gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "the statistical analysis of spatial structures has been a fruitful approach to studying the intermittency of turbulence in numerical simulations .",
    "the methods for identification of structures vary between different studies , but one of the simplest and most common approaches is to identify structures as regions in space bounded by an isosurface of the relevant field . for example , this was applied in hydrodynamic turbulence to study dissipative vorticity filaments @xcite , which revealed that the radii of intense filaments scale with the kolmogorov microscale while lengths occupy large scales .",
    "more recently , similar methods were applied to study current sheets and other dissipative structures in simulations of plasma turbulence , notably in 2d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite , 3d mhd turbulence @xcite , the kinematic dynamo @xcite , ambipolar diffusion mhd @xcite , boundary - driven mhd @xcite , and decaying kinetic turbulence @xcite .",
    "these previous studies succeeded in describing the morphology and scaling properties of intermittent structures , but are incomplete in the sense that they give no information on how the structures evolve in time . for this reason , very little can be said about the dynamics , even if one assumes statistical stationarity .",
    "important temporal information about intermittent structures includes their characteristic timescales , stability , motion , interactions , and impulsiveness .",
    "if one is interested in understanding these temporal aspects of intermittency , then a broader framework must be developed .",
    "temporal intermittency was investigated to a limited extent in hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the temporal statistics of vortices in 2d turbulence @xcite and decaying charney - isotropic geostrophic turbulence @xcite gave insight into global changes in the population size and morphology of vortices .",
    "however , the structures were not entirely treated as temporal objects in these studies , which requires an algorithm for tracking the structures through time .",
    "this can be much more difficult to design and implement than the algorithms used to identify and characterize structures in individual fixed - time snapshots @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , apart from our precursor paper @xcite , no systematic studies of spatiotemporal structures were previously undertaken for hydrodynamic or mhd turbulence in 3d , and only limited studies were performed in 1d and 2d systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the objective of this paper is to extend the framework previously used for the statistical analysis of spatial dissipative structures in numerical simulations of mhd turbulence @xcite into the temporal realm .",
    "we therefore consider the statistical properties of 4d spatiotemporal objects which represent structures evolving through time .",
    "these objects are dissipative processes , analogous to flares in astrophysical systems , which , in general , may involve many interacting coherent structures .",
    "we consider the distributions and scaling relations for process characteristics including the total dissipated energy , peak energy dissipation rate , duration , and geometric scales ; measures of complexity such as the number of interacting structures and types of interactions ( mergers and divisions ) ; and the temporal evolution of individual processes .",
    "this novel methodology is applied to study intermittency in numerical simulations of driven incompressible mhd turbulence ; however , it can also be applied to hydrodynamic turbulence , kinetic plasma turbulence , and other complex dynamical systems exhibiting spatiotemporal self - organization .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper addresses several fundamental questions regarding the intermittency of mhd turbulence .",
    "one key question is whether , in the limit of high reynolds number , the overall energy dissipation is dominated by a few intense , long - lasting events residing at large scales , or by many weak , short - lived events residing near the dissipation scale .",
    "another question is whether there is an inherent relationship between spatial intermittency and temporal intermittency , e.g. , whether larger structures better retain their coherency in time .",
    "a third question is whether the dissipative events show any characteristic temporal asymmetry , e.g. , impulsive onset followed by a slow decay @xcite .",
    "the primary questions addressed in this paper for incompressible mhd turbulence are also fundamentally important for the solar corona . in fact",
    ", our approach has many similarities with observational studies of solar flares @xcite and stellar flares @xcite . in these studies , the time - series of extreme uv , soft x - ray , and hard x - ray emissions from the sun are used to characterize solar flares .",
    "measured quantities include the size , duration , peak intensity , and fluence of the flares , from which the dissipated energy is inferred . in particular , the probability distribution for dissipated energy is of central importance due to its role in assessing the feasibility of the nanoflare model for coronal heating @xcite .",
    "this distribution is observed to obey a power law across eight orders of magnitude , with an index generally close to @xmath1 @xcite , although the precise value of the index varies significantly between different studies depending on the time period , region , type of emission , and methods used to identify the flares .",
    "most importantly , this index is shallower than the critical value of @xmath2 , suggesting that nanoflares do not dominate the overall heating of the solar corona @xcite .",
    ", the critical index is derived by noting that the total energy dissipation , @xmath3 , scales with the lower bound @xmath4 if @xmath5 and with the upper bound @xmath6 if @xmath7 . ]",
    "this analogy with the analysis of solar flares suggests a practical application for the statistical analysis of spatiotemporal structures : to assess whether turbulence plays a role in the intermittent energy dissipation of the solar corona .",
    "it is presently unknown whether the complex dynamics of the solar corona arise from self - organized criticality , turbulence , or some other phenomena @xcite .",
    "this problem can eventually be addressed by a better comparison between numerical simulations of the various models with observations .",
    "our methodology is ideal for making this comparison . as a first step in this direction",
    ", we compare the results in this paper to the observed statistical properties of solar flares , collected from a number of previous studies . we find several nontrivial similarities in both cases , despite the anticipated differences between driven incompressible mhd turbulence and the essentially force - free dynamics of the solar corona .",
    "this suggests that mhd turbulence may play a role in the energetics of the corona , a possibility which should be investigated more carefully in future studies .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first describe the basic concepts and subtleties associated with the temporal analysis of structures in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we then outline the technical aspects of our procedure , based on extending our previous framework for the statistical analysis of spatial structures @xcite , including detailed discussion of the algorithms involved , in section  [ sec3 ] . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    ", we introduce the measurements that are made on spatiotemporal dissipative structures .",
    "the results of our analysis on the combined spatial and temporal intermittency of energy dissipation in 3d mhd turbulence are described in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section  [ sec6 ] , which includes a comparison of our results with the observed statistical properties of solar flares .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "mhd describes the macroscopic dynamics of an electrically conducting fluid , such as a plasma ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given a uniform background magnetic field @xmath8 that is strong relative to turbulent fluctuations ( estimated by the rms value , @xmath9 ) , and assuming that gradients along the background field are small relative to those in the perpendicular direction , the incompressible mhd equations can be written in a reduced form as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the elssser variables ( with directions strictly perpendicular to @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the fluctuating plasma velocity , @xmath14 is the fluctuating magnetic field ( in units of the alfvn velocity , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is plasma density ) , @xmath17 is the total pressure , @xmath18 is the gradient in the @xmath19 directions while @xmath20 is the gradient in the @xmath21 direction , and @xmath22 is the large - scale external forcing . for simplicity ,",
    "the fluid viscosity @xmath23 is taken to be equal to the magnetic diffusivity @xmath24 , and both are assumed to be uniform in space . in the reduced mhd approximation , only the @xmath21-component of current density @xmath25 and vorticity @xmath26 are retained ; these two scalar fields contain complete information to describe the dynamics as well as energetics .",
    "energy loss from the system is governed by resistive dissipation and viscous dissipation , with respective energy dissipation rates per unit volume given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since the current density and vorticity are in direct correspondence with energy dissipation rates , they are logical dynamical fields in which to study the intermittency of dissipation . in this work ,",
    "we focus on resistive dissipation only for simplicity ; it is straightforward to apply the methods to obtain similar statistical results for the viscous dissipation .",
    "intermittency in strong mhd turbulence is characterized by the appearance of thin , quasi-2d ribbon - like structures in the current density , known as ( electric ) current sheets , with similar structures in the vorticity field .",
    "these current sheets are anisotropic in three directions , with the largest scale coinciding with the direction of the local mean field , which is the direction of the guide field to good approximation .",
    "their lengths and widths are distributed mainly in the inertial range , while the thicknesses are strongly localized inside the dissipation range @xcite .",
    "the current sheets are notable for their role in heating , particle acceleration @xcite , and magnetic reconnection @xcite .      in this paper , we aim to study the temporal properties of intense , spatially - coherent structures produced by intermittency in 3d turbulence . for concreteness , we consider current sheets in mhd turbulence . despite their prominence ,",
    "intermittent current sheets occupy a small volume that represents the tail of the probability distribution for current density @xmath29 . to systematically study these structures ,",
    "we employ a framework based on identifying and characterizing the regions in space with current densities exceeding some fixed threshold value , @xmath30 , which is the only parameter inherent to the methodology .",
    "each structure is then represented as a 3d volume bounded by an isosurface of @xmath31 .",
    "it is straightforward in principle to extend this procedure into the temporal realm by applying the same threshold criterion to the 4d spatiotemporal field @xmath32 , thereby obtaining 4d spatiotemporal structures .",
    "however , although simple in principle , it is challenging in practice to analyze a high - resolution 4d data set in this way . assuming that the analysis is applied to post - processed data from well - resolved simulations stored on a computer system , the data storage conditions limit the total number of available snapshots , negatively affecting the possible time cadence of snapshots and size of the overall time interval .",
    "hence , the time resolution of post - processed data must generally be worse than the internal time resolution of the simulation . this is a serious issue",
    "since the data must be well - resolved in all dimensions in order to properly resolve and track structures across a wide range of scales .",
    "a related problem is that the primary memory limits the amount of data that can be loaded by the analysis program at any given time , requiring the numerical procedures to work with small pieces of the overall data set at a time .",
    "therefore , a feasible temporal analysis should be based on first identifying the structures in the spatial dimensions of a given snapshot , and then tracking them through time , from their formation to their destruction .",
    "the algorithms required to perform this task are rather complex , and must be designed in a robust and efficient manner .",
    "in particular , there needs to be an algorithm that accurately associates structures in one snapshot with their time - evolved counterparts in subsequent snapshots .",
    "a fundamental challenge here lies in the fact that there may not be a unique correspondence between a structure in one snapshot and a structure in the adjacent snapshot , due to mergers and divisions .    the interactions between structures",
    "cause the notion of a coherent time - evolving structure to be ambiguous . instead , the objects of central importance are the _ processes involving structures .",
    "these processes can be variously thought of as sets of interacting structures , as dissipative events , or as flares ( if we equate the dissipated energy with outgoing radiation ) .",
    "more generally , they can be thought of as branched spatiotemporal structures .",
    "_       diagrams of some simple processes , where formation is represented by o , interaction by a vertex , and destruction by x. an isolated structure is a process with no vertices .",
    "division and merger processes are the next simplest case , with a single vertex each .",
    "higher - order processes such as loops and scatterings have a larger number of vertices or vertices with more paths.,width=302 ]    in order to build an intuition and facilitate the subsequent discussion of processes , we now describe a convenient classification scheme for processes .",
    "this allows processes to be visualized diagrammatically , which has some superficial similarities to feynman diagrams for quantum mechanical scattering processes @xcite ; however , none of the mathematical symmetries characterized by the feynman rules carry over , since , to the best of our knowledge , isosurfaces in the current density described by the mhd equations contain no conserved quantities .",
    "regardless , the following classification scheme is a simple way to describe processes and their complexity .",
    "we first introduce some terminology .",
    "we define a _ state to be an individual spatial structure at fixed time , which represents the basic building block of processes .",
    "we assume that the states are given at times spaced by an infinitesimal increment @xmath33 .",
    "we also assume that there exists a map between all states at any time @xmath34 to other states at time @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which represents the instantaneous temporal evolution of structures from one state to another state .",
    "we define a _ path segment to be a bijective ( i.e. , one - to - one ) sequence of states under this map , which represents the coherent temporal evolution of an individual structure while it does not interact with any other structures .",
    "we then define a _ path to be a path segment with bijectivity breaking down only at the initial and final states in the sequence .",
    "a process is then described as a set of paths that are ( non - bijectively ) connected at their endpoints , which represents a set of interacting structures . _ _ _    diagrams of some simple conceivable processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interactions ] . here ,",
    "we represent paths schematically as lines with an arrow marking the direction of time .",
    "if the path begins by spontaneous formation , i.e. , from a peak that grows to exceed the detection threshold , then we mark the beginning of the path with an o. if the path ends by spontaneous destruction , i.e. , from a structure that recedes below the detection threshold , then we mark the end of the path with an x. the third possibility is for the path to start or end with an interaction .",
    "interactions between structures are represented by",
    "_ vertices connecting sets of three ( or more ) paths .",
    "a process schematically consists of a set of paths connected by a set of vertices . _",
    "the simplest process is the evolution of an _ isolated structure , i.e. , a structure that is formed and then destroyed without interactions .",
    "isolated structures are described by a single path and have well - defined histories with well - defined properties .",
    "other structures undergo at least one interaction .",
    "the two simplest processes involving an interaction are the _ division of one structure into two structures and the _ merger of two structures into one structure .",
    "since an interaction is non - bijective , the structures in these processes do not have completely well - defined histories , so many of the quantities used to describe isolated structures are ambiguous .",
    "however , we will see that a meaningful set of more general characteristics can be introduced .",
    "_ _ _    we claim that the most logical approach for a temporal analysis is to study processes rather than individual spatially - coherent structures , i.e. , paths , which lose their identity upon interacting .",
    "this is also the most conservative approach , as it requires no fundamental changes to the methodology used for the statistical analysis of spatial structures at fixed time , and requires no ad - hoc assumptions to treat the interactions .",
    "we also find that the statistical trends are more robust for processes rather than paths .",

    "structures from the initial and final states are marked in red.,width=604 ]    in this section , we describe our algorithms for the temporal analysis . since the procedure in its entirety is rather complicated , we include a brief outline in this subsection .",
    "a more detailed description is presented in the rest of this section .",
    "the procedure rests on a hierarchy of steps : first , we find sets of contiguous points ( above the threshold ) in each snapshot to obtain the spatial structures ; next , we find sets of bijectively - connected states to obtain the paths ; finally , we find sets of connected paths to obtain the processes .",

    "we define states as spatially - connected sets ( i.e. , clusters ) of points with current density magnitudes larger than a fixed threshold , @xmath30 .",
    "two points on the lattice are considered spatially connected if the distance between the points is strictly less than two lattice spacings , i.e. , one is contained in the other s 26 nearest neighbors .",
    "we note that this is not the only conceivable way to define a state ; one can , for example , use a variable threshold based on local field quantities such as the local peak current density @xcite",
    ". however , a fixed threshold appears to be the simplest approach , having only one free parameter ( @xmath30 ) and no need for ad - hoc treatment of special cases ( e.g. , mergers ) .",
    "the main drawback of using the fixed threshold is that it generally gives a large number of unresolved structures due to peaks near the threshold ; these do not exhibit physically meaningful scaling relations and must be carefully ignored .",
    "fortunately , they are only manifest as noise in the low - intensity , small - scale regime of parameter space and generally have a negligible contribution to the total energy dissipation and volume of the structures .",
    "to some extent , unresolved structures are inevitable regardless of how they are defined , since there will always be a population of small , short - lived processes representing structures that barely cross the detection criteria .",
    "filtering procedures can be applied to remove the population of unresolved , noisy structures residing near the threshold , but for simplicity we do not apply any filtering in our analysis .",
    "the definition of a state can affect how a _ given process appears ; it may determine , for example , whether the close approach of two structures is registered as a merger or not .",
    "the threshold value may likewise have a similar effect .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that the _ statistical conclusions should be , and in our experience are found to be , broadly consistent regardless of the method or threshold .",

    "since typical thicknesses tend to be comparable to the lattice spacing , we use a linear interpolation scheme to obtain finer measurements .",
    "note that this method can cause the thickness to be over - estimated in some cases with complex morphologies , for example , in structures with s - shaped cross - sections , but these appear to be a relatively small population manifest as spurious high - value measurements .",
    "these definitions automatically satisfy @xmath72 .",
    "we measure these scales in units of the system size in the direction perpendicular to the guide field .",
    "see @xcite for more detailed information on this method applied to high - resolution simulations of mhd turbulence , as well as a discussion on alternative methods based on the minkowski functionals .",
    "states can also be characterized by some discrete properties .",
    "one example is the direction of the current flow , i.e. , orientation .",
    "another example is the presence / absence of topological features such as x - points or o - points [ see @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "a final example is the euler characteristic , i.e. , genus .",
    "these characteristics will be relegated to a future paper .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe measurements for paths , which are conceptually simpler than those for processes due to the bijectivity condition .",
    "these measurements will be used and generalized in the next subsection to characterize processes .",
    "the evolution of a path can be described by the time - series @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 of instantaneous characteristics defined in the previous section for the constituent states .",
    "consider a path given by a sequence of states at times @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the number of constituent states . assuming a fixed cadence of snapshots , the states are separated by a fixed time interval @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath40th state has characteristics denoted by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "one of the most basic properties of a path is its duration ( or lifetime ) @xmath87 , defined as @xmath88 the energy dissipation rate of states generalizes to the dissipated energy , @xmath89 where time integration is performed over the duration of the path .",
    "we also define the peak volume , peak energy dissipation rate , maximum length , maximum width , and maximum thickness as @xmath90 note that since these quantities are local rather than time - integrated , they may be sensitive to chaotic fluctuations . as an alternative",
    ", we can consider time - averaged quantities , which however are less easily generalized for processes .      we now describe how to generalize the quantities defined for paths in the previous section to processes , i.e. , sets of interacting structures .",
    "we characterize each process by the number of constituent paths , @xmath91 .",
    "processes with a single path , @xmath92 , are isolated structures",
    ". processes with three paths , @xmath93 , are division or merger processes",
    ". processes consisting of more than three paths , @xmath94 , are higher - order processes , containing either more than one vertex or vertices joining more than three paths .",
    "other related measures of the complexity of a process include the number of vertices @xmath95 , the number of constituent states @xmath96 , the number of internal paths @xmath97 ( i.e. paths that begin and end in vertices ) , and the number of incoming paths @xmath98 or outgoing paths  @xmath99 .",
    "consider a process with constituent paths enumerated by index @xmath100 , each extending from initial times @xmath101 to final times @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath106 be the characteristics of the @xmath108th path as defined in the previous subsection .",
    "we define the process duration by @xmath109 which is simply the time interval from the formation of the first existing constituent path to the destruction of the last existing constituent path .",
    "the total dissipated energy @xmath110 of a process is defined by integrating @xmath111 across the enclosed 4d spacetime region .",
    "this is found in a straightforward manner from @xmath112 likewise , we can define the peak volume @xmath113 and peak energy dissipation rate @xmath114 as the maximum of the peaks corresponding to the constituent paths , @xmath115 note that an alternative definition for @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) can be based on the maximum of the volume ( energy dissipation rate ) summed for all states belonging to the process at any given time .",
    "these two definitions may differ for processes with a large number of paths , but will otherwise give similar results ; we use the first definition only for simplicity . the most difficult quantities to generalize for a process are the characteristic spatial scales .",
    "there appears to be no universally satisfactory way to obtain _ average characteristic scales for a general configuration with many paths .",
    "if we apply an average across all paths ( or all states ) constituting the process , then the result may be skewed toward unphysical short - lived paths ( or states ) .",
    "a simpler alternative is to take the maximum scale corresponding to any path in the process , @xmath116 one alternative definition for the spatial scales , which gives results consistent with the definition that we apply , is to take the spatial scales from the largest state at the moment of peak energy dissipation rate . _",
    "before discussing the results of our temporal analysis of mhd turbulence , we first describe the numerical simulations .",
    "we consider simulations of strong , incompressible mhd turbulence driven at large scales .",
    "these simulations solve the reduced mhd equations , eq .",

    "the ratio of magnetic guide field to rms fluctuations is set to @xmath117 .",
    "the periodic box is elongated in @xmath118 ( the direction of the guide field ) by a factor of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the perpendicular size of the domain in simulation units .",
    "turbulence is driven at the largest scales by colliding alfvn modes , generated from statistically independent random forces @xmath121 in fourier space at low wave - numbers @xmath122 , @xmath123",
    ". the fourier coefficients of @xmath121 are gaussian random numbers with amplitudes chosen so that @xmath124 .",
    "the forcing is solenoidal in the perpendicular plane and has no component along @xmath125 .",
    "the random values of the different fourier components of the forces are refreshed independently on average about @xmath126 times per eddy turnover time .",
    "the reynolds number is defined by @xmath127 ; we set @xmath128 so that the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath129 , is equal to @xmath130 . durations ( and other timescales ) are measured in terms of large - scale eddy turnover times of the turbulence , given by @xmath131 .",
    "the analysis is performed on time intervals of durations @xmath132 , all of which begin after the simulations reach statistical steady state .          if we suppose that all processes are single paths that evolve with identical ( but rescaled ) functional forms for the energy dissipation rate , then we can derive nontrivial constraints between the indices of the various distributions given in sec .",

    "we first relate the distribution of instantaneous energy dissipation rates , @xmath151 , measured from states at random , to the distribution of peak energy dissipation rates , @xmath152 , measured from processes . assuming that one samples a random value @xmath153 from @xmath154 with uniform time sampling , so @xmath155",
