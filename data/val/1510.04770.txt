    "after the recombination , photons free - stream , but they are still affected by gravitational redshifts . in the dark energy dominated universe , if a photon falls into a potential well along its way to the observer , it must climb out of a shallower potential well than it fell into .",
    "this contribution to the cmb anisotropy from redshifts in the time - varying gravitational potential wells is called the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "non - linear evolution of density fluctuations also contribute to the isw anisotropy and it is called the rees - sciama ( rs ) effect @xcite . thus , the late time isw ( rs ) effect is sensitive to dark energy and its detection presents an independent signature of dark energy .",
    "the cross - correlation between the isw ( rs ) and the local matter density ( or its tracer ) is known to be useful to isolate the isw ( rs ) effect from the cmb @xcite . from now on , we called rs effect including isw effect .",
    "if one can remove the any astrophysical foreground from the cmb measurement , then the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies are produced by various sources including the deflection of cmb photons by the gravitational lensing , the thermal and the kinetic sunyaev - zel@xmath1dovich ( t / ksz ) effects , and the rs effect , in addition to its primordial temperature anisotropies on small angular scales .",
    "thus , the cross - correlation of cmb temperature anisotropies , @xmath2 with the density tracer of the large scale structure ( lss ) , @xmath3 can be written as @xcite _ tr = ( _ pri + _ lens + _",
    "t(k)sz + _ rs ) _ tr .",
    "[ crocor ] among these , one can ignore the primordial anisotropies of cmb , @xmath4 in the cross correlation with the tracer of the lss because their generations have very different epochs . in principle",
    ", one can also remove tsz , @xmath5 from the temperature anisotropies using the multi - frequency observation because of its frequency dependence on the amount of intensity distortion of the photon @xcite .",
    "finally , one needs to consider the correlation between lensed cmb , ksz , rs , and density tracer .",
    "even though the ksz and the mass distribution are not correlated in the linear regime because peculiar velocities of clusters are random in their directions along the line - of - sight , the non - linear cross - correlation between the ksz and the lss is correlated .",
    "however , it is two orders of magnitudes smaller than that of the rs and the lss @xcite .    thus , rs effect can be detected by cross - correlating with some tracers of the large scale structure . as density tracers ,",
    "one can use either the galaxy distribution @xcite or the weak lensing convergence , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there have been observations to detect the cross - correlation between the rs effect and the lss @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum between the rs effect and the weak lensing convergence can be used to investigate the cross - correlation between two quantities @xcite . in order to calculate the non - linear matter power spectrum",
    ", one can use the n - body simulation , the halo model @xcite , or the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "we use the third order spt to calculate the non - linear power spectrum , as it provides the exact calculation in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "this method can be easily extended to various cosmological models compared to the n - body simulation and the halo model . also , the exact solutions for spt of various dark energy models is known @xcite and one can reinforce the previous calculations for the cross - correlation . in this",
    "exact solutions , one can obtain the fully consistent third - order density fluctuation and kernels for the general dark energy models without using the einstein - de sitter universe assumption .",
    "thus , this result is robust for any dark energy model and can be used for the analytic prediction for the cross - correlation .",
    "compared to the cross - correlation of the linear isw effect and the lss , the cross - correlation of the rs effect and the lss has the unique feature of changing from the anti - correlation to the positive correlation .",
    "previously , we show the dark energy dependence on the location of this flipping scale by using the exact 3rd - order spt and claimed this scale might be used as a standard ruler to investigate the dark energy model @xcite .    in this paper , we reinvestigate the cross - correlation of the rs effect and the weak lensing convergence with the exact 3rd - order spt . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the rs-@xmath6 angular power spectrum . in the section 3 ,",
    "we obtain angular power spectra for the different dark energy models and show the dark energy dependence on the flipping scales .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review how to obtain the angular power spectrum of the rs and the weak lensing convergence , @xmath6 .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies due to the rs effect in the flat universe is given by the line of sight integral of the change in the gravitational potential to the last scattering surface , ^rs ( ) = _ l , m a_lm^rs y_lm ( , ) = _ _ ls^_0 d e^- (  +  ) [ k , , ( _ 0- ) ] _ _ ls^_0 d  [ k , , ( _ 0-)][thetaisw ] , where @xmath7 is the conformal time , @xmath8 being today , @xmath9 being recombination , @xmath10 is the optical depth , primes mean the derivatives with respect to the conformal time , @xmath11 is the newtonian potential , and @xmath12 is the spatial curvature perturbation , respectively .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the perfect fluid with the general relativity under the instantaneous reionization assumption .",
    "thus , we ignore the anisotropic stress tensor and the optical depth in the last equality of the above equation ( [ thetaisw ] ) . from this one",
    "obtains the spherical harmonic coefficients for the rs component of cmb a_lm^rs(_0,_0 ) = i^l y_lm^ ( _ ) _ _ 0^_ls d ",
    "j_l(k c ( _ 0 - ) ) [ almrs ] , where @xmath13 is a spherical bessel function . the newtonian potential @xmath11 and its time derivative are given by the poisson equation ( , ) & & - ( ) ^2 ( , ) [ phi ] , +  ( , ) & & - ( ) ^2 (  ( , ) - a h ( , ) ) [ phip ] , where @xmath14 is the present matter energy contrast , @xmath15 is the present value of the hubble parameter , and @xmath16 is the matter density fluctuation , respectively .",
    "the distribution of total matter is probed by gravitational lensing observations . from the poisson s equation , the amplitude of distortion in galaxy images due to wl so - called the convergence , @xmath6 in any particular direction on the sky @xmath17 at the specific redshift , @xmath18 is equal to the projected mass in the born limit , ( , z_s ) = _",
    "0^r_s w(r ) ( r ) dr , where w(r ) = _ m h_0 ^ 2 _ 0^r_s dr [ kappazs ] . in order to take into account a distribution of sources at various redshifts contributing to the weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) , one needs to convolve the convergence , @xmath19 with a normalized radial source distribution function , @xmath20 , ( ) = _ 0^z_s dz_s n(z_s ) ( , z_s ) [ kappa ] .",
    "this distribution of source galaxies often follows a bell - shape with the peak redshift depends on the depth of the survey .",
    "we adopt the parametrization of the radial distribution of source galaxies as @xcite , n(z ) = a z^2 [ nz ] , where the normalization factor , @xmath21 , is determined by @xmath22 .",
    "there also exist more general forms of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath24 and @xmath25 values as in reference @xcite .",
    "again , one can obtain the spherical harmonic coefficients for the convergence a_lm^ = 4i^l k^2 y_lm^ ( _ ) _ 0^r_s dr _ k ( r ) j_l(kr ) [ almkappa ] , where we use the poisson s equation .",
    "then , one can obtain the cross - correlation power spectrum between rs and convergence , @xmath6 c_l^rs-(z_s ) & = & a_lm^rs ( ) a_lm^(,z_s ) = dk k^4 _ 0^r _ dr _ 0^r_s dr p_(k , r , r ) j_l(kr ) j_l(kr ) + & & 2l^2 _",
    "0^r_s dr p_(k= , r ) |_k = l / r [ clrskappazs ] , where the limber s approximation is used in the last equality and define _ ( r ) _",
    "(r ) = ( 2)^3 p_(k , r , r ) _ d ( -  ) [ pphipphi ] , where @xmath26 is a dirac delta function .",
    "one can obtain the total cross - correlation , @xmath27 , by integrating @xmath28 with a weight of source distribution @xmath20 for a given weak - lensing survey c_l^rs- = _ 0^z_s dz_s",
    "n(z_s ) c_l^rs-(z_s ) [ cl ] .",
    "in order to obtain the final result of the cross - correlation of the rs effect and @xmath6 in eq.([cl ] ) , one needs to calculate the power spectrum of @xmath29 in eq.([pphipphi ] ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ phip ] ) , one obtains p_ = ( ) ^2 ( ) ^4 ( p_ - a h p _ ) [ pphipphi2 ] .",
    "if one uses the standard perturbation theory up to the 3rd order , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by @xcite p_(k , ) & = & d_1 ^ 2 ( ) p_11(k ) + 2 d_1 ^ 4 ( ) d^3 q p_11(q ) [ pdeltadelta ] , + p_(k , ) & = & - d_1 ( ) d_1^ ( ) p_11(k ) - d_1 ^ 3 ( ) d_1^ ( ) [ pdotdeltadelta ] , where @xmath32 is the growth factor , @xmath33 are the exact symmetric 2nd and 3rd order kernels of the density fluctuation ( the divergence of the peculiar velocity ) , and @xmath34 .",
    "one can obtain the exact values of them numerically for any model @xcite .",
    "due to the non - linear effect , the cross - correlation of @xmath11 and @xmath35 changes from the anti - correlated to the positively - correlated .",
    "this flipping scale depends on the dark energy model @xcite .",
    "we obtain the linear power spectrum @xmath36 from camb @xcite with @xmath37 ( 0.0226 , 0.1244 , 0.96 , 2.1 @xmath38 , 0.7 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we show the cmb - wl cross - correlation , @xmath27 of different dark energy models for two wl surveys in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this figure depicts the absolute values of @xmath27 . in the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] , we use the deep wl survey ( @xmath41 $ ] ) to investigate the dark energy dependence of @xmath27 .",
    "the dashed , the solid , and the dotted lines correspond to @xmath42 , -0.7 , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is anti - correlated at large angles and changes to the positively - correlation at small angles .",
    "these flipping scales for different dark energy models @xmath42 , and -0.7 are @xmath43 , and 854 , respectively . in the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] , the dark energy dependence of @xmath27 is shown for the shallow wl survey ( @xmath44 $ ] ) .",
    "flipping scales for different dark energy models @xmath42 , and -0.7 are @xmath45 , and 557 , respectively .",
    "thus , the deep survey is prominent for the investigation of dark energy using the flipping scale . also , the deep survey yields the better signal to noise ratio compared to the shallow one @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     . [ fig2 ]",
    "we show that the flipping scale of the cross - correlation between the cmb rs effect and the wl convergence dependence on the dark energy . as the dark energy equation of state , @xmath46 increases , the angular value of flipping scale , @xmath47 decreases .",
    "thus , one might use this flipping scale as the investigation of the dark energy .",
    "unfortunately , this scale dependence on the @xmath46 is degenerated with @xmath0 . however",
    ", if one can use the redshift dependence observables as the flipping scale , then one might be able to break this degeneracy because the they have the different tendencies .",
    "one might be able to use the cross - correlation between the divergence of the momentum field and the density field for this purpose .",
    "this is under the progress .",
