    "presently , searches for neutrino oscillations and a determination of the neutrino mass structure are among the foremost lines of investigation in experimental particle physics . after a long period of searches for neutrino oscillations in short - baseline experiments ,",
    "explorations at nuclear reactors have entered a new phase .",
    "investigations in these realms are now being conducted at ever greater distances , and , for the first time , the masses of the neutrinos and their mixing are being investigated precisely in those regions that are suggested by the observations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos .",
    "specifically , we consider the following experiments and projects :    \\(i ) the chooz experiment that had been performed by a collaboration of laboratories from italy , france , russia , and the united states of america and which had been devoted to searches for antineutrino oscillations at long distances from the reactor used ( the experiment had been completed in 1999 ; the results were published in [ 1 ] ) ;    \\(ii ) the palo verde reactor - based experiment that had been performed by a collaboration of laboratories from the united states of america and which had been aimed at long - baseline searches for neutrino oscillations ( the measurements had been completed by the middle of 2000 ; the results obtained in the exposures of 1998 and 1999 were published in [ 2 ] ) ;    \\(iii ) the project of the kr2det experiment that will seek oscillations at long distances from the reactor used the project , which will pursue oscillations characterized by rather small mixing angles , currently being developed for the krasnoyarsk underground laboratory ( 600 mwe ) [ 3 ] ( it is foreseen that the development of the project will have been completed by 2003 ) ;    \\(iv ) the kamland experiment that is being performed at kamioke by researchers from japan and the united states of america and which is devoted to searches of neutrino oscillations at very long distances [ 4 ] ( it is expected that the first results will have been obtained in 2002 ) .",
    "the results of these laboratory experiments will make it possible to reveal the role of electron neutrinos in the anomalies of atmospheric neutrinos , to verify the hypothesis of solar - neutrino oscillations , and to establish the mass structure of the electron neutrino within the model involving the mixing of three neutrinos .    by searches of oscillations at long distances ,",
    "one usually implies experiments in which detectors are positioned at distances of about l km from the reactor employed ( long - baseline experiments ) .",
    "experiments where the reactor - to - detector distance is 100 km or more are referred to as very long baseline ones .",
    "it should be emphasized that it is owing to impressive advances in developing procedures for reactor - antineutrino detection that long - baseline and very long baseline investigations became possible .",
    "an extensive list of references on the problem of neutrino oscillations from the studies of pontecorvo and his colleagues [ 5 ] , an account of the theory and of the phenomenology of this phenomenon , and a description of the experiments that had been performed prior to 1997 can be found in the review articles [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "another line of neutrino investigations at nuclear reactors focuses on attempts at observing the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "a discovery of the neutrino magnetic moment at a level of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the bohr magneton ) in a laboratory experiment would be of crucial importance for particle physics and neutrino astrophysics [ 8 , 9 ] . in order to explain so `` large '' a value of the neutrino magnetic moment",
    ", it would be necessary to introduce , in the theory of weak interaction , the right - handed w boson in addition to the left - handed one ; moreover , the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the convective zone of the sun could enhance @xmath2 transitions ( spin - flavor precession ) and lead to the emergence of a correlation between the recorded solar - neutrino flux and the magnetic activity of the sun .",
    "it should be noted that such a correlation was indeed observed [ 10 ] .",
    "the experiments that were performed at the reactors in rovno [ 11 ] and in krasnoyarsk [ 12 ] ( see also the review article of derbin [ 13 ] ) yielded the constraint @xmath3 , which is still far from the desired region of values . in section 2",
    "we consider the attempts that are being undertaken at present to improve the sensitivity of nuclear - reactor experiments to the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "projects that are based on the use of intense artificial sources of neutrinos and antineutrinos and which seem rather promising are beyond scope of this article .",
    "a liquid organic scintillator serves as a target for reactor antineutrinos in all experiments that are devoted to searches for neutrino oscillations and which are considered here .",
    "antineutrinos are recorded by the products of the inverse - beta - decay reaction @xmath4 whose threshold is 1.804 mev . the cross section for reaction ( 1 )",
    "can be represented as @xmath5 @xmath6^{1/2}(e-{\\delta})(1+\\delta ) ( { \\rm cm}^{2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 = 1.293 mev , the incident - antineutrino energy @xmath8 and the electron mass @xmath9 are expressed in mev ; the quantity @xmath10 takes into account recoil and weak - magnetism effects and the radiative correction [ 14 ] , and @xmath11 is the free - neutron lifetime expressed in seconds .",
    "the positron kinetic energy @xmath12 in reaction ( 1 ) is related to the absorbed - antineutrino energy by the equation @xmath13    in the majority of the cases , photons arising in positron annihilation are absorbed in the sensitive volume , with the result that the recorded positron energy increases by about 1 mev in relation to than in ( 3 ) . in all experiments ,",
    "use is made of the method of delayed coincidences between the signals from the positron and the neutron . in the chooz and the palo verde experiment ,",
    "neutrons are recorded by the photon cascade having the total energy of about 8 mev and arising upon neutron capture by gadolinium nuclei that are introduced in the target scintillator .",
    "neither the kamland nor kr2det project employs gadolinium @xmath14 the neutron signal is generated there by 2.2 mev photons accompanying neutron capture in hydrogen .    in order to analyze the results of relevant experiments",
    ", it is of crucial importance to know the properties of a reactor as a source of antineutrinos .",
    "per gigawatt of thermal power , a nuclear reactor generates more than @xmath15 electron antineutrinos per second , the majority of which originate from the beta decay of nuclear fragments produced in the reactor core upon the fission of uranium and plutonium isotopes ; about a quarter of these antineutrinos fall in the energy region above the threshold for reaction ( 1 ) . since the second half of the 1970s it has been known that the fragments of different fissile isotopes emit electron antineutrinos having noticeably different spectra . for the fission of @xmath16u , @xmath17pu and @xmath18pu the most precise information about the spectra in the region above 1.8 mev was obtained at the institute laue - langevin ( ill , grenoble ) by the method of conversion of the beta spectra measured for the mixture of fragments [ 16 ] ; for @xmath19u , use is made of the calculated value [ 17 ] .",
    "data that concern the reactor power and the current isotope composition of the burning nuclear fuel and which are necessary for computing the flux and the spectrum of antineutrinos are presented by the reactor personnel .    with the aim of obtaining a reference for normalizing data from the chooz experiment , which had already been planned at that time , the collaboration of college de france ( paris ) , kurchatov institute ( moscow ) , and lapp ( annecy ) measured in 1992 - 1994 the total cross section for reaction ( 1 ) at a distance of 15 m from the bugey reactor ,",
    "whose power is 2.8 gw . the result was [ 18 ] @xmath20 @xmath21 which is in good agreement with the cross section @xmath22 calculated by taking the convolution of the equation cross section from relation ( 2 ) and the spectrum of reactor electron antineutrinos : @xmath23 @xmath24    thus , the cross section measured experimentally is more accurate than the computed value and can serve as a metrological reference for cross sections in the absence of oscillations .",
    "it should be noted that the fine features recently revealed in the emission of reactor electron antineutrinos above the threshold for reaction ( 1 ) increase the error in the cross section ( 4 ) by about 0.5% [ 19 ] .",
    "this circumstance was taken into account in determining the parameters of oscillations in the chooz experiment .    in the next section of the article",
    ", we will consider the spectrum of reactor electron antineutrinos below the threshold for reaction ( 1 ) , because knowledge of this spectrum is necessary for performing and interpreting experiments that look for the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "first of all , we recall basic relations that are valid in the case of mixing of two neutrino - mass eigenstates @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with the corresponding masses being @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath29 in this case , the survival probability p(@xmath30 ) @xmath14 that is , the probability that a neutrino that is produced in the source used will retain its original nature at a distance l ( m ) from the source @xmath14 is given by @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mixing parameter , @xmath34 is the mass parameter , and @xmath8 ( mev ) is the neutrino energy .    in experiments ,",
    "oscillations are sought by a characteristic distortion of the spectrum of electron antineutrinos ( positrons ) and by the reduction of the event - counting rate . for reactor electron antineutrinos ,",
    "the relevant distortions of the spectrum and the accompanying reduction of the counting rate are maximal , provided that @xmath35 relations ( 7 ) and ( 8) demonstrate that , for example , at a distance of i km from the reactor , the sensitivity of the experiment being discussed is the highest at @xmath36 ev@xmath37 and that it becomes poorer fast as @xmath38 decreases .    in the early 1990s",
    ", there appeared motivations for seeking reactor - neutrino oscillations in the range @xmath39-@xmath40 ev@xmath37 , which had not yet been explored by that time .",
    "the investigation of atmospheric neutrinos with the aid of the kamiokande ii and imb cherenkov detectors in [ 20 ] revealed that the ratio of the muon - neutrino flux to the electron - neutrino flux is two - thirds as great as its computed counterpart .",
    "this discrepancy , known as the atmospheric - neutrino anomaly , could be explained under the assumption that intense transitions occur through the @xmath41 channel , through the @xmath42 channel , or through both these channels simultaneously . as to the mass parameter @xmath43",
    ", it could lay within a wide range of values between @xmath44 and @xmath40 ev@xmath37 . at present , observations of atmospheric neutrinos have yielded even mote compelling grounds to believe that neutrino oscillations do indeed exist . if the superkamiokande data are analyzed under the assumption that only the @xmath45 channel is operative , the best description is obtained at the following parameter values [ 21 ] : @xmath46 ( the most probable value ) , @xmath47 it should be emphasized that the superkamiokande data do not at all rule out a noticeable contribution from the @xmath48 channel [ 22 ] .    for more than three decades",
    ", the deficit of solar neutrinos in relation to the computed data has been considered as a strong argument in favor of the existence of electron - neutrino oscillations .",
    "an analysis of solar - neutrino data accumulated by 1998 and the inclusion of the solar - matter effect , known as the mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect made it possible to find , in the ( @xmath49 ) plane , a few regions where parameter values ensure a solution to the solar - neutrino problem [ 23 ] . according to [ 24 ] , the situation changed as soon as new data appeared after the commissioning of the superkamiokande facility in 1998 . at present ,",
    "one of the solutions @xmath14 it is referred to as the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution @xmath14 provides the best fit to the observation data .",
    "the most probable values of the parameters that characterize this solution are @xmath50        in the case where two mass eigenstates @xmath25 and @xmath26 are mixed , there is obviously one mass parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the mixing of at least three mass eigenstates is necessary for two mass parameters @xmath43 and @xmath52 to exist . in the case where three mass eigenstates @xmath53 , and @xmath54 undergo mixing and where three active neutrino flavors @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 oscillate , there are generally three mass parameters : @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . of these ,",
    "only two are independent , since @xmath61 .",
    "according to ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , one of these parameters is two orders of magnitude greater than the other ; therefore , we have @xmath62 @xmath63 in the case of reactor neutrinos that is considered here , there are two mixing parameters in the adopted scheme .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the mixing - matrix elements @xmath64 appearing in the superposition @xmath65 ; that is , @xmath66 @xmath67 where lbl and vlbl stand for , respectively , long - baseline and very long baseline reactor - to - detector distances .",
    "thus , long - baseline and very long baseline reactor experiments make it possible to ( i ) study the role of the electron neutrino in the region of atmospheric - neutrino oscillations ; ( ii ) verify whether the hypothesis specified by ( 10 ) is valid for solar - neutrino oscillations ; and ( iii ) obtain , within the model of three neutrino flavors , the full pattern of the mass structure of the electron neutrino .",
    "the question of the number of neutrino flavors that is greater than three is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "yet , it is worth noting that , according to the data of the lsnd experiment ( los alamos ) , @xmath68 transitions , which are characterized by a rather small mixing angle are observed in the region of large mass - parameter values of @xmath69 1 ev@xmath37 [ 25 ] .",
    "the existence of three mass parameters , @xmath52 , @xmath43 and @xmath70 , requires introducing , at least , yet another mass eigenstate @xmath71 and one sterile neutrino @xmath72 ( either sterile neutrinos do not interact with other particle species at all , or the corresponding coupling constant is much less than the fermi constant ) .",
    "the problem of sterile neutrinos has been discussed in the literature since the first studies of pontecorvo [ 5 ] ; in recent years , interest in this problem has become especially acute in connection with reports on the lsnd experiments ( see , for example , [ 26 , 27 ] and references therein ) . the potential of nuclear reactors for sterile - neutrino searches was schematically considered in [ 28 ] .",
    "the antineutrino detector used was constructed in an underground ( 300 mwe ) gallery at distances of 1000 and 1100 m from two pwr reactors .",
    "the total rated power of the reactors was 8.5 gw . the detector ( see fig .",
    "1 ) was formed by three concentric spheres .",
    "the central zone , which contained 5 t of a liquid organic scintillator with an addition of gadolinium ( about 1",
    "g / l ) , served as a target for electron neutrinos .",
    "the target was surrounded by a liquid - scintillator layer ( not containing gadolinium ) of thickness 70 cm followed by third layer ( 90 t of a scintillator ) , which acted as a passive and an active shielding of the detector .",
    "two inner zones of the detector were viewed by 192 eight - inch phototubes mounted on a nontransparent screen . the second zone ( buffer volume ) , which absorbed annihilation photons and photons arising upon neutron capture in gadolinium that escaped from a comparatively small target , improved considerably the calorimetric properties of the detector .",
    "the experiment was conducted from april 1997 till july 1998 .",
    "this was the period within which the newly constructed reactors gradually approached the rated mode of operation .",
    "this circumstance made it possible to have sufficient time for performing measurements during the operation of each of the two reactors , with the other reactor being off ; during the simultaneous operation of the two reactors ; and during the period within which the reactors were both off ( see table 1 ) .",
    "neutrino events were required to satisfy the following selection criteria : ( a ) the energy of the first ( positron ) event and the energy of the second ( neutron ) event must lay within the ranges 1.3@xmath148 and 6@xmath1412 mev , respectively .",
    "( b ) the time interval between the positron and the neutron event must be in the range 2@xmath14100 @xmath73s .",
    "( c ) the spatial conditions are such that the distance between the phototube surface and any event must not be less than 30 cm and that the first and the second event must not be separated by a distance longer than 100 cm .",
    "as soon as these selection criteria are imposed , the efficiency of neutrino - event detection becomes @xmath74 = ( 69.8 @xmath751.1)% .    in all , about 2500 antineutrinos were recorded over the time of measurements , with the measured counting rate being 2.58 @xmath76/d per 1 gw of reactor power ; the typical event - to - background ratio was 10 : 1 .",
    "the positron spectra measured within the reactor operating and shutdown periods are displayed in fig .",
    "2 . the ratio @xmath77 of the measured neutrino events to that which is expected in the absence of oscillations proved to be @xmath78 @xmath79    in this result ,",
    "the main contribution to the systematic error comes from the uncertainties in the reaction cross section ( 1.9% @xmath14 see subsection 2.1 below ) , in the efficiency of the neutrino - event detection ( 1.4% ) , and in the number of target protons ( 0.8% ) .",
    "constraints on the oscillation parameters were obtained by comparing the entire body of information accumulated in the experiment with the values that are expected in the absence of oscillations . the result ( the `` chooz '' curve in fig .",
    "3 ) depends directly on knowledge of the absolute values of the characteristics of the neutrino flux and spectrum , on the cross section for the inverse - beta - decay reaction , and on the features of the detector . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , electron neutrinos do not show , at the achieved level of accuracy , oscillations in the region @xmath80 : @xmath81 @xmath82 the result presented in ( 14 ) establishes definitively that @xmath83 oscillations can not play a decisive role in the atmospheric - neutrino anomaly .",
    ".modes of data accumulation in the chooz experiment [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section , we will consider attempts at reducing the limit on @xmath84 that are being undertaken by the munu collaboration ( grenoble - munster - neuchatel - padova - zurich ) at the reactor in bugey [ 36 ] and by the kurchatov institute in a collaboration with the petersburg nuclear physics institute at the reactor in krasnoyarsk [ 37 ] . also , mention is briefly made of new - type detectors developed at the institute for theoretical and experimental physics ( itep , moscow ) and at the joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr , dubna ) , the expected event - countlng rates that are quoted in table 3 give an idea of the orders of magnitude of the quantities with which one has to deal in experiments studying electron - antineutrino scattering on electrons .",
    "the munu collaboration has constructed a time - projection chamber ( tpc ) of volume about 1 m@xmath85 , the chamber being filled with a cf@xmath86 gas . at a pressure of 5 atm the target mass is 18 kg .",
    "the chamber is surrounded by a liquid scintillator ( ls ) playing the role of an active and a passive shielding ( see fig .",
    "the gas circulates , passing through filters absorbing oxygen .",
    "since 1998 , the detector has been arranged at a distance of 18.6 m from the center of the bugey reactor .",
    "the structural materials of the reactor edifice that are situated above the detector and which are of thickness approximately equal to 20 mwe ensure shielding from the hadronic component of cosmic rays .",
    "scattering in bugey . ]",
    "the experiment being discussed as measured the energy and the angular distribution of electrons with respect to the momentum of incident electron antineutrinos . within the reactor shutdown periods , it was found that the distribution of background events is nearly isotropic .",
    "however , the absolute value of the background proved to be unacceptably large , and test measurements were performed at a detection threshold of 800 to 1000 kev .",
    "investigations made it possible to establish the origin of the main background sources .",
    "it turned out that the oxygen filter is a source of radon and that the material of the chamber cathode contains an admixture that emits beta particles with an endpoint energy of about 1.2 mev , the removal of the filter and a replacement of the cathode reduced considerably the background , whereupon the threshold was lowered to 300 kev      the detector is being arranged at a depth of 600 mwe in the new laboratory room , where the flux of electron antineutrinos is about 40% less than in the munu experiment .",
    "the target for electron antineutrinos consists of 604 silicon crystal detectors forming a compact assembly of four hexahrdral matrices , each containing 151 crystals .",
    "an individual detector is made in the form of a cylinder of diameter 29 mm and height 100 mm .",
    "the total mass of silicon is 80 kg , a hpge detector of volume 116 cm@xmath85 is positioned at the center of the assembly .",
    "the carrying part of the matrices is manufactured from radiation - pure fluoroplastic .",
    "the target is placed in a cooled chamber with walls of oxygen - free copper .",
    "signals from individual crystals are transmitted through stepwise channels to vacuum joints and , further , to preamplifiers .",
    "the vacuum casing of the detector @xmath14 it is 64 cm in diameter and 62 cm in height and is manufactured from titanium of thickness 4 mm @xmath14 protects the detector from the penetration of radon ( see fig .",
    "this casing is followed by a few layers of a passive and an active shielding , the layer closest to the chamber being made of lead .",
    "it is planned that the detector will have been commissioned at the beginning of 2002 .",
    "the electron detection threshold is presumed to be at a level of 50 kev .",
    "the sensitivity to be achieved in this experiment will crucially depend on the level of the detector background .",
    "a time - projection chamber filled with liquid xenon whose total mass will be 750 kg is being presently developed at itep [ 38 ] .",
    "a scintillation flash arising in xenon upon antineutrino scattering on an electron is fixed by photodetectors specifying the instant at which ionization electrons begin to drift along the electric field aligned with the chamber axis .",
    "after that , the electrons are taken away into the gas phase , where their energy and their x and y coordinates are measured . in the total volume occupied by xenon , the central part containing 150 kg of it",
    "will serve as a target proper for antineutrinos , while the remaining xenon , that which surrounds the target , will play the role of a passive and an active shielding .",
    "the threshold for scattering - event detection is planned to be set at a level not exceeding l00 kev . according to the estimate of the authors of the project",
    ", a sensitivity in the range @xmath88 will be achieved in the reactor - electron - antineutrino flux of @xmath76 @xmath89@xmath90 s.    at present , a detector prototype containing 150 kg of xenon is being tested ( a.g .",
    "dolgolenko private communication ) .      as the threshold for recoil - electron detection",
    "is decreased , events associated with scattering due to magnetic interaction are concentrated in ever narrower energy intervals ( see table 3 ) . not only does this localization of magnetic - scattering events reduce the background that is generated by events of scattering due to weak interaction and which is correlated with the reactor operation , but it also diminishes the relative contribution to these intervals from the intrinsic detector background , which is the main obstacle to advances toward the region of small magnetic moments .",
    "semiconductor ionization germanium detectors make it possible to explore the region of energies much lower than those investigated in the bugey and krasnoyarsk experiments . by using a hpge crystal of mass about 2 kg at the gran sasso laboratory , which is situated at a depth of 3200 mwe",
    ", the heidelberg - moscow collaboration demonstrated the possibility of achieving , in the range 11@xmath1430 kev ; the background spectral density at a level of 0.1/(kev kg d ) [ 39 ] . to the best of my knowledge ,",

    "it is expected that , at a detection threshold of about 3 kev and a 20 mwe depth of deployment , the spectrometer background will not exceed 0.3/(kev kg d ) .",
    "a cryostat makes it possible to increase the germanium mass up to 6 kg .",
    "it is planned that the spectrometer will be installed at one of the reactors of the atomic power plant in kalinin . according to the estimate of the authors of the project , the sensitivity to the value of @xmath84 there will be about @xmath91 in a flux of @xmath92/s over two years of data accumulation .    at present ,",
    "low - background detectors are being developed for measuring much lower energies ( see [ 41 ] and references therein ) . these are , first of all , a silicon cryogenic detector that employs the effect of ionization - to - heat transition , which was discovered at jinr in the 1980s , and , then , a germanium detector involving an internal amplification of ionization signals ( avalanche germanium detector , also known as agd ) .",
    "employment of such detectors will further expand the possibilities for seeking the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "however , advances down the scale of electron energies measured in reactor experiments are hampered by the emergence of a new form of correlated background , that which is associated with recoil nuclei from elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering . here ,",
    "at the threshold of the absolutely unexplored region , we conclude the section devoted to describing searches for the antineutrino magnetic moments in reactor experiments .",
    "reactor experiments make it possible to explore the masses of the neutrinos and their mixing in the region of small mass parameters not presently accessible to accelerator experiments .",
    "the chooz experiment established definitively that the @xmath93 channel is not dominant in the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "kamland may become the first experiment that will employ terrestrial neutrino sources and which will discover the phenomenon of oscillations , determine the contributions of the masses @xmath94 and @xmath95 to the electron neutrino , and find a solution to the solar - neutrino problem . the kr2det experiment , which is characterized by a high sensitivity to small mixing angles ,",
    "will probably be able to reveal the contribution of the mass @xmath96 to the electron neutrino or to set a more stringent limit on its value .",

    "searches for the neutrino magnetic moment that are being performed at the reactors in bugey and krasnoyarsk , an experiment that will employ a large xenon chamber and which is being prepared at itep , and a foreseen breakthrough into the region of low and ultralow recoil - electron energies will presumably permit going beyond the constraint @xmath97 , which could not have been strengthened for the three past decades , and expanding the range of searches toward a value of @xmath98 .",
    "the metrological basis of these investigations has become firmer . in particular , the features of the flux and of the spectrum of reactor antineutrinos are being refined and a simple recipe has been found that makes it possible to determine the cross sections for the inelastic scattering of reactor electron antineutrinos on atomic electrons .",
