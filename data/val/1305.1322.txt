    "gas giants can form as a result of core formation by planetesimal accretion followed by formation of the gas envelope through accretion from the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite distinguished three phases of this process , using numerical simulations of core accretion and envelope evolution . a first phase marked by the fast accretion of solids onto a core until the feeding zone of the planet",
    "is mostly evacuated ; a second phase where gas and solid accretion is low and constant ; a third stage when the core mass equals the envelope mass , leading to the contraction of the envelope and the onset of runaway gas accretion @xcite .",
    "migration of the planet might allow for an extension of the feeding zone , while gap formation might lead to a mass limit for gap opening planets .",
    "in the outer parts of the disk , giant planets could form as a result of the collapse of a gravitationally unstable disk clump .",
    "this mechanism requires a very massive disk that can cool effectively on timescales of a few local orbital periods @xcite .",
    "monte carlo models of planet formation produce synthetic populations of extrasolar planets , with a large diversity of initial conditions .",
    "these models have been successful in reproducing key features of the observed distribution of exoplanets ( e.g. ) .",
    "the calculations usually include one - dimensional disk evolution and core / envelope structure models .",
    "the accretion of planetesimals and gas onto an already formed proto - core is included , using a given prescription for the accretion rates of gas and rocky materials onto the planet .",
    "for this reason , an accurate estimation and parameterization of the accretion rates of gas onto planets for a variety of conditions is necessary to correctly calculate the formation time and the limiting mass of the giant planetary population .",
    "so far , the accretion of gas onto planets has been modeled using two different approaches . on one side ,",
    "one dimensional models have been used to calculate the radial structure of the envelope and the accretion onto a rocky core .",
    "these models can include effects such as the dust opacity of the envelope , the release of energy of infalling planetesimals into the envelope and the thermal feedback of the planet @xcite .",
    "these models can include the disk evolution only in a restricted way , and assume a certain model of the outer envelope ( as a boundary condition ) that is spherically symmetric .    on the other hand , two / three - dimensional simulations of accretion disk with accreting planets aim to estimate the structure of the flow around the planet and how much mass the disk is capable of feeding to the planet .",
    "however , most of these simulations do not include the radiative feedback from the planet and a detailed model of the inner envelope . @xcite and @xcite used high - resolution two - dimensional simulations to study the detailed flow pattern around the planet , and the circumplanetary disk .",
    "they showed that inside the planet s roche lobe , accretion in the circumplanetary disk is powered mainly by energy dissipation of circulating matter at the spiral shock .",
    "outside the roche lobe , gas flows onto the planet through `` accretion bands '' located between the horseshoe flow and the passing - by flow ( although the detailed structure depends strongly on the sound speed ) .",
    "the accretion timescale @xmath4 has been measured to be around @xmath5 yr , and the accretion rate of a jupiter - mass planet has been found to be of the order of @xmath6 on a disk with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional simulations including radiation transfer have found similar accretion rates and have shown the formation of a thick ( @xmath8 ) circumplanetary disk .",
    "the properties of the circumplanetary disk have been the subject of various numerical and semi - analytical studies . @xcite used radiation - hydrodynamics numerical simulations to study the planet - disk system , and derived important properties such as the power law dependence of density with radius , and the scale height of the stellar disk .",
    "their calculations show that the disk density falls with radius as @xmath9 to @xmath10 , and the disk is fairly thick , with @xmath11 , with no significant flaring .",
    "@xcite developed a model for the circumplanetary disk that includes the contraction of the planet envelope and the properties of the inflowing gas material from the disk .",
    "they find various phases of gas accretion and collapse where the circumplanetary disk can either provide mass to the planet or act as a `` spin - out disk '' where the mass flux is outwards .",
    "the inner circumplanetary disk rotates keplerian up to a small fraction of the hill sphere and then rotation becomes sub - keplerian in the outer region .",
    "the issue of the circumplanetary disk size , or the truncation mechanism of the circumplanetary disk , is also crucial for the fate of the solid material .",
    "the inner keplerian rotating thick disk is truncated at a fraction of the hill sphere ( @xmath12 ) , but this seems to depend on the viscous mechanism acting in the circumplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggests a different picture for the accretion flow in an inviscid isothermal circumplanetary disk . in this case",
    ", the bulk of the accretion does not occur in the disk mid - plane region , but instead at high latitudes in the planet hill sphere . in the equatorial region ,",
    "an outflow is present through the lagrangian points l1 and l2 .",
    "this flow structure is similar to that observed by in radiative non - viscous simulations .    in this paper",
    "we perform numerical simulations to study the accretion rate of gas onto giant gap - opening planets and the circumplanetary disk in turbulent magnetized disks using , for the first time , three - dimensional global stellar disk simulations .",
    "the turbulence in the disk is generated by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "a minimum degree of ionization leading to a good coupling between the gas and the magnetic field in the stellar disk is required for the mri to function . in the cold and dusty mid - plane regions",
    "the ionization will be low , possibly producing a dead - zone , while on the outer parts of the disk , cosmic rays can penetrate allowing for the necessary ionization degree .",
    "a planet gap , however , might lower the local density to a sufficient level to allow for ionization of the mid - plane regions , leading to an mri active zone .",
    "therefore , this type of turbulence could conceivable be still present in the planet corotation region .",
    "we compare the accretion rate onto a planet in an mri - turbulent disk with that in a viscous laminar disk and we examine the accretion structure and mass inflow into the hill sphere , where material passes through the circumplanetary disk to be accreted by the planet .",
    "the viscosity provided by the turbulence in the stellar disk ( either modeled by an @xmath0 prescription or by `` real '' magnetic turbulence ) is acting indirectly in the circumplanetary disk .",
    "there is no extra viscosity applied to the circumplanetary disk , nor is this disk mri unstable on its own .",
    "all the effects we observe are due to the viscosity of the circumstellar disk , be this a laminar kinematic viscosity , or a magnetic turbulent transport .",
    "note that the mri is not resolved in the circumplanetary disk , and the question of what mechanism drives accretion in this disk is still unresolved .",
    "the effective transport comes from the transport of angular momentum in the stellar disk .",
    "we also concentrate strictly on the phase when a gap has been cleared in the disk , and study the efficiency of the stellar disk in providing mass to the forming protoplanet .",
    "the choice of simulating a locally isothermal disk is justified for simulations with a jupiter mass planet since at this planet mass the accretion rate approaches the isothermal result and is independent of the opacity treatment @xcite .",
    "additionally , for this mass range , the accretion rate onto the planet depends on the ability of the circumstellar disk to provide material , which is the effect we study in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the computational setup , boundary and initial conditions , and the parameters we use in our simulations .",
    "we also describe the prescription for the mass accretion onto the planet . in section 3.1",
    ", we present our results on the three - dimensional structure of the accretion flow into the hill sphere .",
    "section 3.2 contains the results on the mass accretion rates for the different simulations , while section 3.3 shows additional details of the accretion flow around the planet .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our results in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "simulations were performed using the finite volume fluid dynamics code pluto @xcite . in the code , time stepping is done using a second order runge kutta scheme , while the spatial integration is performed using linear interpolation through the second order tvd scheme .",
    "the riemann fluxes are computed using the hllc and hlld solvers for the hd and mhd cases , respectively .",
    "the code uses the constrained transport method for preserving a divergence - free magnetic field @xcite .",

    "the initial density distribution is given by @xmath24 the disk is described by a locally isothermal equation of state @xmath25 . the ratio of the pressure scale height @xmath26 to the radial coordinate of the disk @xmath27 is taken to be a constant such that @xmath28 .",
    "+ the gravitational potential of the planet is given by a softened point - mass potential @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the softening parameter , needed to avoid numerical divergence near the position of the planet .",

    "buffer zones are defined at the radial boundaries to avoid boundary effects , where for @xmath40 the magnetic resistivity is given by @xmath41 and for @xmath42 the resistivity is @xmath43 .      since our aim is to find the accretion rate onto the planet only in the stage when the gap is cleared , the planet is allowed to accrete gas after 100 orbital periods at @xmath44 have elapsed ( see figure [ fig : gap ] ) . at this stage",
    ", a gap has been cleared , and the density has been reduced by more than 95% . for the hydrodynamical simulations , viscosity is added explicitly as a source term in the momentum equation .",
    "we use an @xmath0-type kinematic viscosity in the circumstellar disk which is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath0 takes values of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the accretion onto the planet is modeled by removing a fraction of the mass inside a portion of the hill sphere at each time step . at each timestep",
    "the new density @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 the accreted mass by the planet in timestep @xmath50 is @xmath51 .",
    "the planet accretion rate for timestep @xmath50 is calculated as the accreted mass divided by the timestep @xmath52 .",
    "the factor @xmath53 represents the accretion timescale in which the hill sphere is emptied if there was no gas flowing in from the disk .",
    "this is chosen to be @xmath54 inside the inner half of the hill sphere and @xmath55 in the outer half of the hill sphere ( where @xmath56 is the keplerian angular frequency at @xmath35 ) .",
    "a density floor is applied to the simulations with magnetic fields , where the density is not allowed to drop below @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , the density in the simulation never reaches this value .",
    "the magnetic field is not modified as the density is reduced inside the hill sphere in order to preserve a divergence - free field .",
    "the accretion rate has been shown to be dependent on the accretion radius ( the distance from the planet up to which mass is removed ) and on the accretion timescale parameter @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite showed that the accretion radius should be small ( @xmath58 ) and the accretion timescale should be on the order of the orbital period , in order to obtain converged results . because of our lower resolution , we take most of the mass from within the inner half of the hill sphere ( our resolution element is @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) . this prescription has also been used in previous studies of gas accretion and migration by giant planets @xcite .",
    "we also checked that our results remain valid if one restricts the accretion radius down to @xmath61 .",
    "we have also verified that we obtain the same results if we extend the accretion timescale to @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we study the structure of the density and the inflow of mass in / into the hill sphere .",
    "the density structure of the disk around the planet can be seen in figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the color and contour lines represent the density .",
    "the circumplanetary disk is shown for the viscous simulations with @xmath63 , and for the magnetized disk simulation ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the horizontal density contours signal a disk with a scale height increasing linearly with radius from the planet , and with no flaring .",
    "additionally , the density drops with radius away from the planet approximately as @xmath64 .",
    "this is consistent with the density profile found by @xcite using higher - resolution radiation - hydro simulations .",
    "the find the disk profile to be described by a power law between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows the azimuthal velocity and density of the circumplanetary gas .",
    "the velocity profile is consistent with rotation around the planet , and the density profile increases inwards in all cases .",
    "we note that the rotation of the circumplanetary gas is significantly sub - keplerian ( with respect to keplerian motion around the planet , not the star ) .",
    "the azimuthal velocity of the gas in the disk of the planet rotates at less than 50% keplerian speed .",
    "the velocity structure is also not significantly sensitive to the viscosity , while the density ( and therefore the angular momentum ) increases with viscosity .",
    "the higher density in the large viscosity runs might be due to the higher mass transfer rate from the circumstellar disk to the circumplanetary disk",
    ". the larger the viscosity , the larger the amount of mass that the stellar disk can feed to the planet disk , therefore increasing the density surrounding the planet , and possibly the accretion rate of gas onto the planet .",
    "the distribution of angular momentum in the circumplanetary disk is shown in figure [ fig : f22 ] .",
    "the left plot of this figure shows the angular momentum scaled with the initial density , while the right plot shows the specific angular momentum .",
    "both quantities are calculated with respect to the planet .",
    "the angular momentum distribution increases in the inner part of the disk , and levels off at @xmath65 .",
    "this is consistent with the definition of the edge of the planet disk proposed by @xcite , since in a keplerian disk angular momentum increases monotonically outwards ( however , at this distances we start to reach the limit of our grid resolution which is @xmath66 in the radial direction ) .",
    "this criterion could define the edge of the keplerian rotating inner disk , before rotation becomes sub - keplerian in the outer parts of the disk .",
    "however , we also note that we do not obtain keplerian rotation in this inner part , although this might be affected by a resolution limit .",
    "@xcite obtained a value of @xmath67 for the cutoff radius , and @xcite obtained similar values .",
    "this value is also similar to the truncation radius defined by the radius where tidal effects by the central star become important enough to disturb the inner keplerian rotating disk @xcite .",
    "we calculate the mass flux through the surface of the hill sphere .",
    "the mass flux is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the equation describing the surface of the hill sphere .",
    "the mass flux is plotted in figures [ fig : f3 ] and [ fig : f4 ] for four runs .",
    "these quantities have been averaged in time .",
    "we plot the surface of the hill sphere using an ellipsoidal projection where the three - dimensional structure can be observed .",
    "the center of the ellipse corresponds to the point in the hill sphere that is most distant from the star .",
    "the density and mass flux are much larger in the case with the higher viscosity ( @xmath70 ) , and are the lowest in the turbulent magnetized case . in all cases ,",
    "all the net flux through the surface is inflowing , and we see no significant amount of gas entering the hill sphere from the vertical direction above and below the mid - plane .",
    "the bulk of the accretion at this distance from the planet is confined to the mid - plane `` region '' .",
    "figure [ fig : f44 ] shows the vertical structure of the mass flux averaged over the azimuthal direction .                                                  in this section",
    "we study the dependence of the flow structure on the viscosity in the simulations and the effect of turbulence on the accretion flow onto the planet .",
    "figure [ fig : f7 ] shows the radial mass flux and the pressure ( and magnetic pressure @xmath71 ) at a distance of @xmath72 from the planet position . in the mid - plane , the thermal pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure by a factor of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "there is radial inflow of gas coming from both sides of the planet ( although inflow is not spherically symmetric in the mid - plane and is not maximum in the line joining the star and planet ) , and this is dominant in the high viscosity case . as the viscosity gets lower , the density and mass flux decrease .",
    "the magnetized case shows radial mass inflow comparable to the two cases with the lower @xmath0 viscosity , or lower .",
    "the radial profile of the thermal pressure is similar for all cases , although the pressure across the hill sphere decreases with viscosity . at either side of the planet , following the spiral arms ,",
    "there are bumps of high magnetic pressure . in this region , the magnetic pressure is now comparable to the thermal pressure .",

    "overplotted is the mid - plane vector field of the velocity .",
    "figure [ fig : f9 ] shows the same quantities for the magnetized turbulent circumstellar disk simulation . in agreement with previous studies",
    "@xcite , we find that the gas accreting onto the planet comes from a flow between the open pass - by flow and the gas that is orbiting in horseshoe orbits at corotation .",
    "this comes from both sides of the planet , as can be seen in the velocity field in the upper right and lower left part of figures [ fig : f8 ] and [ fig : f9 ] .",
    "material enters the hill sphere through these channels , as it is also seen in the mass flux at the surface of the hill sphere in figures [ fig : f3 ] and [ fig : f4 ] . inside the hill sphere , the gas accretes onto the planet through the circumplanetary disk .",
    "two - dimensional inviscid simulations show accretion in the planet disk that is powered by a spiral shock where gas looses energy and spirals inwards .",
    "this is not observed in our simulations , since in three - dimensions shocks are smoothed out and the resolution in the disk is not sufficient . outside the hill sphere ,",
    "we see the spiral arm structure that forms the bow shock ( see @xcite ) , although the shock is smeared out by viscosity and turbulence in our simulations .    in the case of the magnetized turbulent run ,",
    "the velocity structure around the planet is much less uniform in comparison with the laminar viscous run .",
    "this is due to small scale turbulence and the non - uniformity of the magnetic field .",

    "we will refer to @xmath75 to denote the alpha stress that is _ measured _ in the magnetized simulation , and to @xmath0 to denote the viscosity parameter that is _ chosen _ for the viscous laminar simulations .",
    "the measured alpha is calculated as sum of the contributions to the internal stress by the reynolds @xmath76 and maxwell magnetic stress @xmath77 , where the brackets denote the mean value over the computational domain ( excluding magnetic buffer zones ) and @xmath78 is the pressure .",
    "the total stress is additionally normalized by the density .",
    "the velocities @xmath79 denote deviations from the mean value .",
    "we will first discuss the laminar simulations .",
    "the largest planet accretion rate is obtained for the viscous simulation with @xmath70 , as it is expected since the stellar disk accretion rate is proportional to the viscosity in the more simple analytical approximation .",
    "the limit of the lowest viscosity that the code is able to resolve above numerical dissipation effects is @xmath80 .",
    "additionally , at this low viscosity , our simulation time is not able to cover the viscous evolution , since the viscous timescale is given by @xmath81 .",
    "the magnetic case shows an interesting behavior .",
    "we find the average planet accretion rate in the magnetic case to decrease drastically during the first stages of the simulation .",
    "it seems to stabilize at a value of the accretion rate similar all the viscous simulations , but still presents more variability than the purely viscous cases . in the magnetized case ,",

    "there is an initial rapid rise due to the material that has been accumulated in the hill sphere during the previous evolution of 100 orbital periods . after this stage",
    ", the planet has consumed the `` excess '' of material , and accretes at a rate by which the circumplanetary disk can provide material .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ fig : f6 ] that even though the initial conditions are slightly different ( some simulations have more gas accumulation around the planet depending on viscosity , as seen in figure [ fig : gap ] ) , after the initial phase is passed , the planet accretion tends to relax to more or less steady state values .    previously , @xcite and @xcite found growth times of @xmath86yr .",
    "@xcite found gas accretion rates onto the planet of @xmath87 for jupiter mass planets , which indicates a growth time of @xmath88yr .",
    "@xcite calculated accretion rates for various values of the planet mass , using radiation - hydrodynamics simulations . for a planet with mass equal to the mass we use in our study ( a jupiter mass ) , they find an accretion rate onto the planet of @xmath89 .",
    "we find a mass accretion rate of @xmath90 for the laminar viscous case with @xmath70 .",
    "for the magnetized simulation we find @xmath91 .",
    "these rates are measured only when the planet has already cleared a gap around its orbit , contrary to the previous studies .",
    "our surface density at the position of the planet is therefore very small , as compared to previous studies .",
    "we measure a surface density after gap opening of @xmath92 at the position of the planet . scaling our accretion rates to the surface density value used by @xcite ,",
    "the accretion rate we measure is @xmath93 , which is similar to what was obtained by @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the accretion rate is possible , since the quantity should vary linearly with surface density ( in the simple viscous model ) .",
    "figure [ fig : f11 ] shows the planet accretion rate as a function of the circumstellar disk @xmath0 for the laminar viscous runs .",
    "the rate obtained in the magnetized run is shown as a dotted line since @xmath0 is not constant in this case , and the diamond symbol signals the global stress at the beginning of the simulation . for the magnetized case , after 100 orbital periods ,",
    "the turbulence has decayed as was seen in the simulations presented in @xcite",
    ". the effective global averaged stress coming from the turbulence at the beginning of the simulation ( right before planet accretion starts ) is @xmath94 .",
    "the maxwell stress at the beginning of the run is @xmath84 . in the magnetic case ,",
    "the measured planet accretion rate is smaller than in all laminar viscous runs and it is a third of the accretion rate in the viscous run with @xmath95 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that turbulent transport is achieved mainly at the large scales , while the effective viscosity provided by the turbulence at the small scales is not represented by the global value of the measured @xmath75 .",
    "there also remains the question of how well small - scale turbulence is resolved in our simulations .",
    "it is possible that higher resolution allows for smaller structure turbulence and transport on smaller scales .",
    "the mass accretion into the hill sphere happens along two channels or bands located at each side of the planet @xcite .",
    "closer to the radial location of the planet , material can not flow in , and instead performs a u - turn , since it looses its angular momentum rapidly as it approaches the planet .",
    "radially away from the planet , the gravitational torque of the planet is not strong enough to pull the material in fast enough , and instead gas orbits passing the planet .",
    "the planet accretion flow lies between these two regions . in all cases , we find that the accretion of gas into the hill sphere is not spherically symmetric , nor azimuthally symmetric . in all cases ,",
    "the flow through the vertical direction is negligible and the flow is restrained to low latitudes . in our simulations ,",
    "the hill radius is approximately equal to the pressure scale height of the circumstellar disk .",
    "our results are consistent with results presented by @xcite , who performed hydrodynamic radiation simulations of the planet - disk system .",
    "they show that the inflow of the planet accretion flow is confined to the mid - plane region , and is negligible at polar latitudes .",
    "however , recent simulations by @xcite suggest a different picture , where accretion onto the planet mainly occurs through the vertical direction , and there is no inflow along the mid - plane . in fact , @xcite show that there is significant mass outflow from the hill sphere in the mid - plane , through the lagrangian points l1 and l2",
    ". this flow structure could be a robust feature of inviscid simulations , as it was also observed before by .",
    "@xcite speculate that the main difference between these two results is the presence of explicit viscosity , as we have in the simulations presented in this work . in this case",
    ", the circumplanetary disk has an inflow of gas and and outflow of angular momentum .",
    "however , contrary to circumstellar disks , we find that the outer circumplanetary disk is very sub - keplerian .",
    "this feature of the disk has also been observed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we can not yet achieve such high resolution as in their work , to properly resolve the very inner planet disk ( @xmath96 ) where rotation might follow a keplerian profile .",
    "this transition from sub - keplerian to keplerian rotation can have important implications for the dynamics of solids in circumplanetary disks . in the outer parts , large particles that orbit with keplerian speed",
    "would feel a large head wind which leads to fast inwards migration .",
    "this migration could be significantly reduced at the location where the disk becomes keplerian , creating the possibility for accumulation and growth of solids in this transitional radius .",
    "this is a issue that deserves further study .",
    "the inclusion of the curvature , global gradients , gap opening and a locally isothermal equation of state ( all which are included in this study ) could also play a role in the difference in flow structure as compared to previous studies , since they break the symmetry observed in the work by @xcite .",
    "we have studied the scenario where the stellar disk turbulence indirectly affects the accretion of gas in the circumplanetary disk , but we have not assumed that the circumplanetary disk is mri - unstable , since the planet disk may or may not be subject to the mri @xcite , and might in fact have a different viscosity and accretion mechanism than the circumstellar disk .    ( crosses ) and the turbulent run ( diamond and dotted line ) .",
    "the diamond corresponds to the global average measure of @xmath75 in the magnetized disk simulation .",
    "however , this quantity varies vertically and decreases towards the mid - plane.,width=566 ]",

    "accretion rates are most closely approximated analytically by using the reduced density in the gap region .",

    "the density profile in the outer parts ( @xmath99 ) of the circumplanetary disk can be approximated by @xmath64 and the rotation of the gas is highly sub - keplerian , which has important consequences for the dynamics of solids in the disk around the planet and the formation of satellites .",
