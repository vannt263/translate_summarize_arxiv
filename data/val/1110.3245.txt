    "the origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has been a mystery for more than forty years . the highest energy cosmic rays ( @xmath1 ev )",
    "are usually thought to be extragalactic origin , and various kinds of astrophysical objects have been suggested as primary source candidates , including gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "theoretically , uhecr sources are expected to be powerful enough . for cosmic - ray accelerators associated with an outflow",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  ev are a fraction of magnetic luminosity to the total luminosity , the nuclear mass number of cosmic rays , the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , the velocity of a shock or wave in the production region in the unit of speed of light and the energy of cosmic rays , respectively . among known candidates",
    ", few steady sources such as fanaroff - riley ( fr ) ii galaxies seem to satisfy this condition in local universe for @xmath9 , which is inconsistent with the observed anisotropy as long as uhecrs are protons  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "also , zaw et al . (",
    "2009 ) argued that the power of agn correlating with detected uhecrs seems insufficient to produce uhecr protons .",
    "the above luminosity requirement can be satisfied , however , if uhecrs are generated by powerful transient phenomena like agn flares , grbs and newly born magnetars even if they are protons  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other possible astrophysical solution is to consider that heavy nuclei dominate over protons , where the required luminosity is reduced by @xmath10 and therefore more objects are allowed to be uhecr sources .",
    "indeed , the heavy - ion - dominated composition has been implied by recent results of the pierre auger observatory ( pao )  @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , only a few nearby radio galaxies or even a single agn such as cen a may contribute to the observed uhecr flux  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other sources , including radio - quiet agn  @xcite and grbs  @xcite , are also viable .",
    "the absence of anisotropy at @xmath11 may imply high abundance of nuclei  @xcite even at thelower energies , the origin of which is unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "the pao data on the fluctuation of @xmath12 seem difficult to be reconciled with the @xmath12 distribution of the same data  @xcite , and proton composition may be possible with a different estimator of primary composition  @xcite . also , the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) has claimed proton - dominated composition even above @xmath13  ev  @xcite .",
    "there are different arguments and the uhecr composition has not been settled experimentally .",
    "proton composition seems possible at present .    if uhecr sources are transient , that is , the source activity is shorter than the dispersion of the arrival time produced by cosmic magnetic fields during propagation , the direct identification of uhecr sources by uhecr observations is a more difficult task than that for steady sources due to the delay of the arrival time between uhecrs and other neutral messengers ( photons , neutrinos and gravitational waves ) emitted by the same source activity .",
    "multi - messenger approaches are definitely powerful , but it is important to extract as much information as possible from uhecr observations as one of the messengers . for transient sources , relations between observed quantities and the properties of uhecr sources have been discussed , considering intervening cosmic magnetic fields  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "any candidate of primary uhecr sources has to possess enough energy budget to reproduce the observed flux , which is the product of the energy input per activity and the rate of bursts or flares .",
    "the rate of bursts or flares is related to the apparent uhecr source number density , which can be determined from anisotropy in uhecr arrival distribution .",
    "the relation between the rate and the apparent source number density is less obvious , depending on the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) and poorly known extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmfs ) .",
    "the gmf unavoidably affects uhecrs arriving at the earth .",
    "considering the gmf allows us to evaluate the above relation and to give a constraint on candidates of transient uhecr sources through comparing between the rate inferred from uhecr observations and that of known transient phenomena  @xcite .    despite current uncertainty in egmfs",
    ", it has been believed that the inhomogeneity of the egmfs in the universe is crucial for the propagation of uhecrs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the universe indeed has structures , which consist of clusters of galaxies , filaments , sheets and voids .",
    "it has been suggested that magnetic fields in the structured regions were amplified via cosmological structure formation , and various numerical simulations of the structure formation have shown that the egmf distribution follows the matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so , astrophysical objects including astrophysical uhecr sources are generally embedded in the structured regions .",
    "thus , these magnetic structures also unavoidably affect the propagation of uhecrs .",
    "the structured egmfs play essential roles in the time - delay and time - profile spread of uhecrs as well as their deflections .    in this paper",
    ", we study the roles of structured egmfs on the propagation of uhecrs , and see how the properties of transient uhecr sources , e.g. , the rate of uhecr bursts or flares @xmath14 , can be constrained . in section  [ idea ] , we describe basic relations between the uhecr burst rate and observational quantities that can be obtained by uhecr experiments .",
    "possible signatures of transient uhecr sources that may be seen in the arrival distribution of uhecrs are also discussed . in section  [ prop ]",
    ", we numerically calculate the propagation of uhecrs in the magnetized structures for various source positions , and evaluate the time spread due to the structured fields .",
    "then , in section  [ results ] , we discuss possible constraints on the uhecr burst rate and cosmic - ray energy input burst , taking into account large uncertainty in the void egmf .",
    "we present discussions in section  [ conclusion ] and summarize this study in section  [ summary ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "the proton - composition is assumed , and @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is adopted .",
    "uhecrs above @xmath20  ev can not avoid energy - loss due to photomeson production with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons  @xcite .",
    "hence , nearby uhecr sources within the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) radius mainly contribute to the observed flux , which is typically the energy - loss length of @xmath21  mpc at @xmath22  ev .    for practical purpose ,",
    "we here introduce @xmath23 that is the maximum distance of sources of uhecrs observed with the energy @xmath24 at the earth .",
    "this is defined as the distance within which sources are responsible for 99  % of the total observed flux .",
    "this definition is more appropriate than what we used in @xcite , where the energy - loss length of the photomeson production is simply adopted , because sources outside the energy - loss length can still significantly contribute to the total observed flux due to a volume effect .",
    "we estimate @xmath23 through a backtracking method of the propagation of uhecrs with a continuous energy - loss approximation on the photomeson production and bethe - heitler pair creation with cmb photons  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dmax ] shows @xmath23 calculated on the assmption that uhecr emissivity is proportional to @xmath25 and the spectral index of -2.6 , where @xmath26 is cosmological redshift .",
    "note that @xmath23 is not sensitive on these assumptions since it is essentially determined by the energy - loss of the photomeson production .",
    "one sees that @xmath23 rapidly decreases owing to the photomeson production with cmb photons with increasing the energy of protons .",
    "@xmath23 is typically 200 mpc and 75 mpc at @xmath27 ev and @xmath0 ev for @xmath28 ev , respectively .     on the assumption of @xmath28 ev ( _ solid _ ) and @xmath29 ev ( _ dotted _ ) .",
    "the maximum distance rapidly decreases due to photomeson production with cmb photons with increase of the proton energy .",

    "* for a review ) .",
    "assuming that egmfs are incoherent ( @xmath33 ) , a typical deflection angle of uhecrs during propagation in extragalactic space is estimated to be @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 mpc and @xmath36 are the propagation distance of uhecrs and the larmor radius of the uhecrs for the characteristic egmf strength of @xmath37 g and the correlation length of @xmath38 mpc , respectively .",

    "the last inequality is obtained from an upper limit on the averaged egmf from faraday rotation measurements of distant quasars , @xmath40  @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , several plausible gmf models predict deflection angles of @xmath41 at @xmath42 ev and smaller at higher energies in almost all the directions in the sky  @xcite .",
    "those deflections seem comparable to the the correlation angle between uhecrs and their source candidates which were originally reported by the pao , @xmath43 above @xmath42 ev  @xcite .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that such angular scale should not always be interpreted as the typical deflection angle of uhecrs , i.e. , the source candidates could be tracers of true sources , both of which are embedded in the large - scale structure which are spread with typical angular scale of @xmath44 in local universe in the projected sky . a careful correlation analysis on the pao data with galaxies in local universe suggested the correlation with the large scale structure , implying the deflection angles of @xmath45 more conservatively  @xcite .",
    "uhecrs propagate along different paths in magnetized space , which produce the time profile spread of a uhecr burst .",
    "the spread is comparable with the time - delay @xmath46  @xcite .",

    ", let us assume that the egmf in voids is negligibly weak for the uhecr propagation , focusing on effects of the structured egmfs .",

    "the energy - loss of protons was neglected except for @xmath23 in discussing the analytical expressions . the energy - loss during propagation",
    "will be taken into account when numerical calculations are performed in section [ prop ] and [ results ] .",
    "we call sources `` transients '' when the intrinsic duration of uhecr production at a source @xmath75 is shorter than the characteristic time profile spread @xmath76 at the observed energy of @xmath24 .",
    "if the time dispersion is longer than the time scale of uhecr observations , we misperceive that uhecr bursts are steady sources , and therefore can define the `` apparent '' number density of uhecr sources @xmath77 .",
    "the source number density is related to the rate of uhecr bursts @xmath14 as  @xcite @xmath78 the source number density generally depends on uhecr energies , since the apparent duration is dependent on energies explicitly .",
    "uhecrs observed at the earth suffer from the gmf and egmfs embedding their sources.the gmf typically has order of @xmath79 for a disk component , and it also has random and halo components . in principle , @xmath14 can be estimated by equation  ( [ eq : estrate ] ) if the time spread by these fields and the egmf in voids can be well estimated .",
    "however , the egmf in voids is highly uncertain as discussed in the last subsection , but could contribute to the total time spread significantly because of large propagation distance compared to the size of galactic space and the magnetic structures around sources .",
    "this uncertainty leads to a finite range of allowed values of @xmath14 .",
    "given inevitable contributions of the gmf and egmfs embedding uhecr sources to the apparent duration , @xmath80 , and the allowed maximal time spread including the contribution from the poorly known egmf in voids , @xmath81 , the rate of uhecr bursts is limited as  @xcite @xmath82 here , @xmath77 can be , in principle , estimated from anisotropy in the arrival distribution of uhecrs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , one has to focus on uhecrs with higher energies to examine cases where @xmath76 is shorter than the apparent time interval between bursts or flares occurring in the same angular patch , @xmath83 . in reality",
    ", uhecrs have finite deviation angles due to cosmic magnetic fields , so uhecrs from a source arrives within a finite solid angle @xmath84 around the source , which can be regarded as the appropriate size of the finite angular patch . for a given @xmath14 , the apparent time interval between bursts in the region of the sky with @xmath85",
    "is estimated to be @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 gpc@xmath89 yr@xmath17 .",
    "we take the typical positional correlation scale as @xmath90 , and use @xmath91 as a reference choice , which corresponds to @xmath92  ng  mpc@xmath71 .",
    "this is reasonable , since this is consistent with the effective egmfs estimated in the last subsection and a current upper limit of the void egmf from a plausible cosmological model is 2.5 ng for @xmath55 mpc @xcite , but more conservative discussions with larger values of @xmath90 are also possible .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : deltat ] ) implies that a smaller @xmath85 gives larger @xmath83 , but @xmath83 should be limited to the burst / flare intermittence in a host galaxy , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number density of host galaxies of uhecr sources . in other words , @xmath85 smaller than the corresponding lower limit is meaningless ,",
    "at which one host galaxy should exist in a volume with a solid angle @xmath85 within @xmath23 .",
    "we call the case `` bursting case '' that only one burst or flare contributes to arriving uhecrs at a time in a direction , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "then , the requirement @xmath95 gives a sufficient condition to apply equation  ( [ eq : estrate ] ) , which leads to @xmath96 with the usage of equation  ( [ eq : estrate ] ) .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : nlim ] , the range of @xmath77 , in which equation  ( [ eq : estrate ] ) can be applied , is extended to larger @xmath77 at higher energies , because the smaller number of sources contributing to the observed flux decreases the probability that two bursts are temporally overlapped in a region of the sky ( see also equation  ( [ eq : deltat ] ) ) .",
    "thus , we especially focus on cases of @xmath97  ev to demonstrate constraints on @xmath14 in sections  [ prop ] and [ results ] , although discussions are general for other @xmath24 .",
    "note that , although we here fix @xmath90 even at higher energies , smaller values of @xmath90 are expected there , so that the extension of the curve to higher energies would be more easily justified .    on the other hand , if @xmath98 , another uhecr burst may start to contribute before the end of the former uhecr burst is observed , and equation  ( [ eq : deltat ] ) implies , @xmath99    ) is valid .",

    "future uhecr experiments with large exposures may detect a large number of the highest - energy events and allow us to determine the dependence of @xmath77 .",
    "now , remember that , even if @xmath90 was small , @xmath83 would be limited by @xmath105 . in other words , @xmath77 must not be larger than @xmath94 , and thus the curve of @xmath77 may be saturated .",

    "the relations were briefly discussed in @xcite .",

    "however , if steady sources have different @xmath112 among sources , @xmath77 could depend on @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , @xcite demonstrated that steady uhecr sources with the power - law spectral slope of @xmath113 can reproduce the observed steep spectrum if a power - law distribution of @xmath112 with the index of @xmath114 among sources is assumed . in this case",

    "a source is located on the axis of the cylindrical filament and emits uhecrs toward a direction perpendicular to the axis with the jet opening angle of 0.1 radian .",
    "although the direction of the jet with regard to the axis of the cylindrical filament depends on individual sources , this configuration is justified because it provides with a reasonable lower limit of the time - delay and resultant time spread of uhecrs .",
    "in addition , this allows us to avoid the dependence of results on the height of the cylinder , although it is assumed to be 25 mpc .",
    "regarding the correlation length of the magnetic fields , the energy of turbulence is , in general , injected at large scale characterized by the driving scale of a turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the energy is transferred into smaller scale turbulence , and then is dissipated to thermal energy at small scale . in the intermediate scale , the energy spectrum of the turbulence can be well described by a power - law spectrum in many cases . focusing on this region we model the egmfs as kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "however , these models do not consider magnetic fields at spatial scale larger than that where the power - law spectrum is valid .",
    "the ignorance of the larger scale magnetic fields let us underestimate the deflection angles of uhecrs .",
    "since the spectral shape of the magnetic fields depends on their generation mechanism , scale and geometry , we avoid the uncertainty and simply employ kolmogorov turbulence with the maximum scale so larger than the correlation lengths @xmath135 and @xmath136 , as to reproduce the analytical estimation of uhecr deflection angles in the last subsection on average .",
    "we set @xmath137 kpc and @xmath138 kpc for the maximum scale .    in any case ,",
    "once a uhecr is emitted from a source , the propagation of the uhecr is calculated by solving the equation of motion in each magnetic structure taking energy - loss processes by interactions with ambient photon fields , i.e. , photomeson production and bethe - heitler pair creation , into account .",
    "an event generator sophia is adopted to simulate the photomeson production @xcite , and the energy - loss rate of protons by the bethe - heitler pair creation is estimated by an analytical fitting formula in @xcite .",
    "when the uhecr reaches the boundary of the structures , we record the time - delay and deflection angle of the uhecr , and obtain these distributions from the propagation results of many uhecrs .",
    "the time - delay and deflection angles of uhecrs in the gmf is estimated by using a backtracking method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the gmf model , the bs - s model used in @xcite , which was originally proposed by @xcite , is adopted .",
    "since the gmf is distributed similarly to the galactic arm , the time - delay of uhecrs depends on the arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "so , we adopt a value averaged over the whole sky as a typical value of time spread .",
    "all the energy - loss processes can be neglected because the propagation path length of protons is much smaller than their attenuation length at energies we are interested in .",

    "note that the @xmath0 ev is the energy of protons at the local frame of the magnetic structures .",

    "@xmath145 , @xmath147 and @xmath146 are proportional to @xmath148 because the turbulent fields are assumed , which were able to be confirmed by the numerical simulations .    here ,",
    "let us check the validity of @xmath91 .",

    "a cluster of galaxies produces the deflection of protons larger than @xmath150 .",
    "however , in this case , the sky region where uhecrs from the source are occupied is determined not by the deflection angles but by a viewing angle of the magnetic structure ; i.e. , @xmath149 is satisfied if @xmath151 mpc .",
    "thus , only the virgo cluster ( @xmath152 mpc ) does not satisfy this requirement .",
    "if the virgo cluster does not have uhecr sources , @xmath91 is still justified . otherwise , it is sufficient to continue discussions that a larger @xmath153 is adopted . in the latter case ,",
    "the validity of equation  ( [ eq : limit ] ) is a bit changed as shown in equation  ( [ eq : nslimit ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath100 to simply compare the case of clusters of galaxies with the other cases in this paper .",
    "for uhecrs observed at energies @xmath24 , while the time spread by the gmf should be estimated at the observed energy @xmath24 , that by structured egmfs embedding their sources should be considered by using @xmath154 , which is the energy of uhecrs at generation , because uhecrs lose their energies during propagation in intergalactic space .",
    "this is specially important when @xmath24 is higher than the threshold of the photomeson production . assuming that uhecr sources are uniformly distributed in local universe",
    ", we introduce characteristic time spread in the structured egmfs as @xmath155 where x @xmath156 fil , cc , c1 . here",
    "@xmath154 is calculated by the backtracking method used for the calculations of @xmath23 .",
    "we adopt the characteristic time profile spread @xmath157 to constrain @xmath14 below . since @xmath24 is lower than @xmath154 for any @xmath24 and @xmath48 because of energy - loss ,",
    "@xmath158 is generally smaller than @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , @xmath158 instead of @xmath157 gives a more conservative constraint .",

    "if the sources are located in filamentary structures , the characteristic time spread is estimated as @xmath159 , where @xmath160 yr at @xmath32 ev . for the remaining two cases where uhecr sources are embedded in clusters of galaxies , the time spread produced by the clusters is much longer than that produced by the gmf , i.e. , @xmath161 yr and @xmath162 yr at @xmath32 ev , respectively .",
    "these values constrain @xmath14 from an upper side in the bursting case .    as mentioned before",
    ", the egmf in voids may mainly contribute to the total time spread of uhecr bursts .",
    "following equations  ( [ eq : tau ] ) and ( [ eq : chartau ] ) , and @xmath100 , the characteristic time spread by the void egmf is limited as @xmath163 here , @xmath164 dominantly determines @xmath81 in all the cases , when @xmath165 is larger than @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 .",
    "then , we can constrain the rate of uhecr bursts following equation  ( [ eq : limit ] ) for the bursting case , and otherwise @xmath14 is constrained by equation  ( [ eq : limitapp ] ) , into which @xmath81 is substituted instead of @xmath76 .",

    "note that @xmath32 ev , @xmath28 ev and @xmath100 are assumed . ]",
    "although we focused on transient uhecr sources in this work , one should keep in mind that the information on @xmath174 itself is relevant , whether sources are steady or transient .",
    "since actual @xmath77 must be smaller than @xmath94 at any energy @xmath24 ( unless multiple images caused by sufficiently strong egmfs lead to difficulty in determination of plausible @xmath174 ) , comparing @xmath174 with the number density of know astrophysical sources such as fr i / ii galaxies should be useful , as have been discussed for steady uhecr sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a recent constraint on the apparent source number density is @xmath119 mpc@xmath89 above @xmath42 ev @xcite .",

    "a limit when only the gmf contributes to the propagation , i.e. , the effect of a magnetic structure around sources is negligible , is shown ( _ red _ ) , which is regarded as a conservative case discussed in @xcite",
    ". the black dashed line and solid line are the same as in figure  [ fig : einput ] .",
    "note that , for the cases where sources are embedded in clusters of galaxies , constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath178 given in figure  [ fig : einput ] are more relevant . ]    in this study , we adopt simple three zone models of magnetic fields ( the gmf , a structured egmf around sources , and the void egmf ) , but modeling of the egmfs have large uncertainty at present .",
    "cosmological structure formation simulations have indicated that cosmic magnetic fields have complex web structures following matter distribution @xcite . at present",
    ", the volume filling fraction of relatively strong ( @xmath179 ng ) magnetic fields , i.e. , filaments and clusters , highly depends on models and methods ( see figure 9 of @xcite ) . also , the spectrum of the magnetic fields is crucial for the propagation of uhecrs , though it is not certain .",
    "an observational constraint of the magnetic strength of egmfs in filamentary structures is only @xmath180 g @xcite and there is no direct observational implication on the direction and coherent length of the magnetic fields .",
    "while a turbulent magnetic field with the kolmogorov spectrum with @xmath68 ng is simply adopted in this work , several numerical simulations have indicated the existence of large - scale fields in filamentary structures  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a coherent component deflects the trajectories of uhecrs more efficiently and makes longer time - delay compared to a turbulent component . in this case",
    "the time spread of a uhecr burst is smaller than the time - delay because particles similarly propagate due to the large - scale component .",
    "the complex web of egmfs implies that structured egmfs on the way from sources to the milky way outside egmfs embedding the sources could also play a significant role in the total deflection and time sperad of uhecrs , but these do not affect our constraints derived in the previous section in the scope of our egmf models .",
    "possible effects of such egmfs are making additional deflection and time spread of uhecrs .",
    "as long as the additional deflection is small enough , the time spread by the egmfs embedding the sources provides conservative constraints . in order to see the effects , we begin from evaluating the probability that uhecrs encounter a magnetic structure on the way to the earth during propagation , which can be calculated from the number density , @xmath181 , and cross - sectional area , @xmath182 , of the structure x. the number density , @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the volume of the structure x , is @xmath185 mpc@xmath89 and @xmath186 mpc@xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the cross - sectional areas are @xmath187 mpc@xmath188 and @xmath189 mpc@xmath188 , so the encounter probability is 0.24 and @xmath190 for 75 mpc propagation in the cases of filaments and clusters , respectively .",
    "thus , whereas it is unlikely for uhecrs to encounter clusters during their propagation , some of uhecrs penetrate into a filamentary structure once .",
    "but their typical deviation angle of protons with energies above @xmath0  ev is still smaller than the considered value of @xmath100 ( see figure  [ fig : def200 ] ) , so that such intervening egmfs do not affect our conservative results .",
    "stronger constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath171 from additional time spread can be expected especially if uhecrs must pass the local magnetized structure , as discussed afterwards .",
    "one might expect the situation where effects of structured egmfs are even more prominent .",
    "we could misperceive the positions of uhecr sources from their arrival directions if uhecrs propagate selectively along the magnetic web structure and/or are strongly scattered off by the structured egmfs  @xcite .",
    "when such effects are large in the universe , taking larger values of @xmath90 will be more realistic .",
    "also , as recently suggested , the structured egmfs may increase the probability that we observe uhecrs from transient sources thanks to significant time spread longer than the intrinsic burst duration of the sources  @xcite .",
    "the milky way is thought to be located in a dense region in local universe .",
    "although magnetic fields in the local structure is highly uncertain , it could be another unavoidable egmf for uhecrs arriving at the earth .",
    "a constrained simulation has shown that the milky way belongs to a filamentary structure adjacent to the local supercluster @xcite .",
    "may be possible if the milky way is located in the edge of the virgo cluster @xcite",
    ". such a strong local magnetic field may be relevant as well as the void egmf , especially when the strong effective magnetic field is required as in the scenario of high - luminosity grbs  @xcite . ] assuming our filament model for the local magnetic structure , this egmf is dominant in @xmath80 in the case where sources are located in filamentary structures because the time profile spread should be estimated as @xmath191 instead of @xmath192 .",
    "figure  [ fig : einput2 ] shows possible constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath171 in the case where the local filament is included .",
    "conservative constraints by the gmf , which is discussed in @xcite , is also shown .",
    "for a filamentary structure between a source and the local environment discussed above , the time profile spread can also be conservatively estimated by @xmath191 , and therefore the same constraints as the case of the local filament are applied even if uhecrs pass several filamentary structures . in the cases that sources are embedded in clusters of galaxies , constraints are unchanged because the time spread of uhecrs by egmfs in the clusters of galaxies is much larger .",
    "the discussions in section  [ results ] , where only egmfs surrounding the sources are considered , provide conservative constraints .",
    "if the volume filling fraction of structured egmfs and the nature of local magnetic environments are understood , we would be able to obtain better constraints .",
    "as seen above , it is obviously crucial to reduce the uncertainty of the egmfs both theoretically and observationally in future to understand the properties of transient uhecr sources . in order to get better knowledge on the egmfs , faraday rotation surveys by future experiments such as square kilometer array are useful .",
    "detection of tev synchrotron pair echo / halo emission produced by uhe gamma - ray bursts / flares also may allow us to probe structured egmfs with @xmath179  ng  @xcite .",
    "future numerical simulations on structured egmfs can also give us more insight into consequences to transient uhecr source population .    throughout this paper",
    "we have focused on protons . even though heavy nuclei are considered , the discussions in this paper are in principle applicable . a basic difference between protons and heavy nuclei is electric charge , i.e. , nuclei suffer from deflections @xmath5 times as large as protons and the time spread roughly @xmath10 times as large as protons . if structured egmfs only in the vicinity of uhecr sources affect the propagation of nuclei , the discussions are valid because the deviation scale , @xmath90 , reflects not the deflection angles of nuclei in the magnetic structures but a viewing angle of the structures .",
    "however , the gmf and a magnetic field in the local group would become seriously important .",
    "for the gmf , since the deflections of nuclei are too large at energies less than @xmath0 ev , we should focus on nuclei with energies much higher than @xmath0  ev . the deflection angles of nuclei could be the order of tens degree above a few times @xmath0 ev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , even considering the gmf , the discussions can in principle possible with larger values of @xmath90 ( e.g. , @xmath193 ) .",
    "it is very uncertain that such discussions are possible even when an egmf in local group is taken into account because of more uncertainty .",
    "future studies on effects of the egmf in local group will be necessary .",
    "although we have focused on an extragalactic component of uhecrs , possible galactic sources , including grbs  @xcite , hypernovae  @xcite , fast - rotating neutron stars  @xcite and magnetars , also could contribute to observed uhecrs .",
    "in general , galactic source scenarios have difficulty to reproduce anisotropy in the arrival distribution of uhecrs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite suggested that galactic sources would cause the gradual change of uhecr composition reported by the pao and therefore also contribute to the uhecr flux around the ankle without inconsistency with observed anisotropy .",
    "however , this scenario does not affect our discussions , since it still requires an extragalactic component of uhecrs above @xmath194  ev , which we are interested in .",
    "although we have considered how we can reveal transient sources with observations of charged cosmic rays , for transient sources , the multi - messenger approach is definitely relevant , i.e. , high - energy neutrino observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gev - tev gamma - rays  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and uhe photons  @xcite are helpful for identifying the sources .",
    "we studied the propagation of uhecrs with analytical models of structured egmfs , and demonstrated the effects of the structured fields on revealing the properties of transient uhecr sources by uhecr experiments .",
    "while the void egmf seems difficult to probe , structured egmfs may be measured by future radio observations or revealed by dedicated numerical simulations .",
    "then , uhecr experiments with large exposures may allow us to constrain transient uhecr source population by comparing the derived properties , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath171 , with those of known astrophysical transients such as grbs , agn flares and magnetar generation ( see table 4 of @xcite for generation rates ) .",
    "we demonstrated that the energy - dependence of the apparent source number density @xmath77 is a crucial hint of transient sources , where , as we argued , observations above @xmath195  ev are desirable due to the possible multiple - burst contamination at lower energies .",
    "once this transient feature is identified , the rate of uhecr bursts @xmath14 and energy input per burst @xmath171 can be limited , given good knowledge on the structured egmfs .      1 .   to estimate @xmath77 from high event statistics and to see whether uhecr sources are transient from the energy dependence of @xmath77 , 2 .",
