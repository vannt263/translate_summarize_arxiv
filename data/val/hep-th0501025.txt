    "the region where the eos parameter @xmath1 is less than @xmath3 is typically referred as a phantom dark energy universe .",
    "this is caused by the fact that when the phantom eos is constructed in terms of a scalar field the corresponding kinetic term is chosen to have a wrong sign ( negative kinetic energy ) .",
    "of course , this is not the only possibility : the phantom - like value for @xmath1 may appear from brans - dicke ( bd ) scalar - tensor gravity , from non - standard ( negative ) potentials , from the non - minimal coupling of scalar lagrangian with gravity or even usual matter may appear in phantom - like form .",
    "recent works @xcite have been devoted to the study of phantom cosmologies produced by different models .",
    "the existence of the region with @xmath0 ( if such a phase in the universe evolution indeed occurs ) opens up a number of fundamental questions .",

    "the phantom dominated universe ends up with a finite - time future singularity called big rip or cosmic doomsday ( see refs .",
    "this last property attracted much attention and brought the number of speculations up to the explicit calculation of the rest life - time of our universe ! in its turn , such a study motivated the mathematical investigation of singularities when the dec or the strong energy condition ( sec ) is violated @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "however , the big rip singularity is characterized by the growth of the energy and curvature invariants with a divergent scale factor at big rip time .",
    "the energy scale may grow up to planck one , giving rise to the second quantum gravity era .",
    "eventually , quantum effects become important near the singularity where they may moderate or even prevent the singularity @xcite .    in such circumstances ,",
    "it is fundamentally important to understand the properties of singularities in phantom dark energy universe , to classify them and to search for realistic ways to avoid the singularities . the present article is devoted to the investigation of the above circle of problems .",
