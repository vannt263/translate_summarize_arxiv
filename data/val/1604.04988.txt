    "studying coronal features and their time - varying properties may allow us to investigate the relations between events ( flares , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , jets , bright points , etc . ) and overall solar activity ( teske and thomas , 1969 ; tan _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ; kilcik _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ) .",
    "the solar corona is characterized by a three - part structure consisting of active regions ( ar ) , the quiet sun ( qs ) , and coronal holes ( ch ) . when the sun is observed in soft x - rays and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelengths ,",
    "very bright areas cover a small fraction of the full disk .",
    "these areas are called active regions .",
    "numerous dynamic events such as flares , jets , and plasma heating occur within these areas , resulting in the release of enormous quantities of energy ( aschwanden , 2006 ; priest , 2014 ) .",
    "in addition to ars , dark areas mostly emerge near the northern and southern polar zones of the sun with plasma of lower density and an open configuration of magnetic field lines .",
    "these are termed coronal holes @xcite . because the plasma within these areas is most of the time depleted , chs appear much darker than the other parts of the sun ( ar and qs ) . here",
    ", we mainly focus on segmentations of ars and chs , and qs would be attainable as the complement of the identified regions .    the increasing amount of solar data necessitates automated methods for the detection of solar features .",
    "this need has dramatically increased in recent years . to address this need ,",
    "many types of automatic segmentations and identifications of solar features have been proposed for observations obtained with solar instruments ( _ e.g. _ , _ solar dynamics observatory _ , _ transition region and coronal explorer _ , and _ big bear solar observatory _ ) .",
    "a sample of methods based on region - growing techniques employed for extracting ars in magnetogram images includes boundary - extraction @xcite , which distinguishes between consecutive images to remove both quiet - sun and transient magnetic features @xcite .",
    "it also uses local intensity thresholding , median filtering and morphological operations at 195   and magnetograms @xcite .",
    "another method was proposed by kestener _",
    "( 2010 ) on the basis of the wavelet transform modulus maxima method . in new efforts for visual segmentation , pattern - recognition methods ( both supervised and unsupervised techniques )",
    "were developed to increase accuracy and stability .",
    "some supervised techniques were established based on bayesian classifiers @xcite and fuzzy rules @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the unsupervised techniques provide a focus for characterizing coronal regions consisting of a method that is based on optimization and accurate definition of clusterings in the regions of interest @xcite .",
    "another significant and perhaps the most efficient classification method to derive distinguishing properties of coronal features is the spatial possibilistic clustering algorithm ( spoca ) @xcite , which has been developed mainly to determine the boundaries of ars and chs .",
    "this algorithm uses the fuzzy c - means algorithm ( fcm ) , and a corrected version of the possibilistic c - means algorithm ( pcm ) to integrate neighboring intensity values . for detailed information about coronal image processing and visualization and comparison between both the segmentations and overall detection performances , we refer to ireland and young ( 2009 ) , revathy _",
    "( 2005 ) , and verbeeck _ et al . _",
    "( 2013 ) , respectively .    in image - processing categories ,",
    "the segmentation algorithms are generally expanded into three groups : a first group of algorithms employs region - based methods , edge - based methods are approaches used for determining boundaries , and hybrid approaches are methods that allow us to use the two algorithms mentioned above .    our  proposed region - based  segmentation  algorithm is  designed based on the  bayesian framework .",
    "to do this , a posterior model is designated to labels , and in this way , we need to obtain both prior and likelihood models rooted in bayes rule .",
    "the potts model @xcite is considered as the prior model of labels @xcite .",
    "in addition , a markov - gauss model ( mgm ) and non - local means ( nl - means ) are combined to achieve a likelihood model @xcite .",
    "the idea of using these new models , which was employed in the field of noise - reduction models for the first time ( gilboa and osher , 2007 ) , is an efficient method among other recent standard developments ( dong _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; werlberger _",
    "et al . _ , 2010 ; gilboa and osher , 2007 ; takeda _ et al . _ , 2009 ) .",
    "the gibbs estimator is employed to estimate labels and hyperparameters @xcite .",
    "the procedure of cellular learning automata is added to the process to sample labels @xcite .    here , we checked our code on solar data obtained from euv full - disk images ( 171   and 193  ) recorded by sdo / aia to extract ars and chs .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we describe the data in section [ data ] , explain the segmentation method applied on euv images in the bayesian framework in section [ segmentation ] , and present the results and a discussions in section [ res ] . finally , the results are interpreted in section [ conc ] .",
    "the modern space telescope _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) was launched on february 11 , 2010 to study the solar atmosphere in many wavelengths with high temporal cadence and high spatial resolution .",
    "the sdo with the instrument _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia : lemen _ et al . _ , 2012 ) provides full - disk imaging of the sun in several uv and euv bands with a pixel size of about 0.6@xmath0 . here ,",
    "sdo / aia 171   and 193   data sets are employed to test our segmentation code . as the evolution of ars and explosive events are best observed at 171   ( innes and teriaca , 2013 ; schmieder _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ) and chs are well - detectable features at 193   @xcite , our code is prepared to detect ars and chs at 171 and 193  , respectively .",
    "the normalization of image intensities @xcite and modification of limb brightening @xcite are applied on the dataset as preprocessing steps .    to study the physical properties of ars and chs ( _ e.g. _ , filling factors and brightness  fluctuations ) ,",
    "our  automatic recognition  code  was applied to an sdo@xmath1aia 171 and 193   dataset recorded during 2011 , from 1 january to 31 december , taken at 13:00 ut at a cadence of one image per day .",
    "the following statistical concepts are briefly discussed . the segmentation model based on bayes rule",
    "was employed to identify pixel labels . in the markovian process",
    ", the intensity of each pixel ( each state ) only depends on the four nearest neighbors ( the previous state ) @xcite , named the mixture of markov  gauss model ( mgm ) @xcite . in the present work",
    ", the spatial dependence of pixels was considered nonlocally ( the higher order of neighborhoods ) markovian . to do this , the pixels were weighted based on nonlocal means ( nl - means ) .",
    "next , an image was defined as a lattice - like system , wherein intensity and other properties of pixels such as orientation of edges were the same as states of atoms . by assigning an energy function to the image , gibbs distributions were then computable @xcite",
    ". to model the image , a markov random field ( mrf ) was used , which is a set of random variables consisting of a markov property dissected by an undirected graph @xcite .",
    "we can explain images by an assembly of nodes corresponding to pixels .",
    "the potts model represents models for interacting spins ( equivalent to pixels ) on a crystalline lattice ( equivalent to the image ) by a simple hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "lastly , cellular learning automata ( cla ) , a mixture of cellular automata ( ca ) algorithm and learning automata ( la ) method , were employed to estimate certain pixel labels @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be the intensity of pixels in the segmentation modeling of an image .",
    "it is assumed that the image @xmath3 is the union of @xmath4 disjoint homogeneous regions ( _ e.g. , _ ars , chs , and qs ) .",
    "each region can be shown with labels represented by @xmath5 , in which each pixel is related to a label @xmath6 , and r represents the set of all pixels ( union of regions ) .",
    "the selection of labels for regions concerning the whole of the possible states , which is related to the intensity of pixels , can be interpreted as an inference bayesian problem .",
    "using bayes rule , the posterior probability distribution of labels of pixels is given as @xmath7 where , @xmath8 is the posterior distribution of labels .",
    "the unknown hyperparameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are related to the image model ( or likelihood model ) @xmath11 and the labels model ( or prior model ) @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the model @xmath11 has the role of the likelihood distribution in equation ( [ pospr ] ) .",
    "the image intensity within the i - th region only depends on the corresponding label . for",
    "both the independent and identically distributed form , the image model is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the set of pixels within the @xmath15-th region .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mean and the variance of the pixel values in the k - th region , respectively . starting with the pioneering work of ayasso and djafari ( 2010 ) ,",
    "the mgm is defined by @xmath18 the parameter @xmath19 is defined as follows :    [ lmu ] _ k(*r * ) m_k , & if @xmath20 , + _ * r*_*r * x_*r * , & if @xmath21 ,    where @xmath22 is the set of the four nearest neighbors of pixel @xmath23 . the parameter @xmath24 is representative of contours , wherein @xmath25 is the delta dirac function . for pixels located within contours , the value of @xmath26 equals 1 ; otherwise , it is set to zero .",
    "each pixel is considered a markov random variable , where the central pixel @xmath27 is the new state of markovian process @xmath28 , and neighboring pixels are the previous state of markov @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ lmu ] ) shows that the mean value of adjacency connectivity is not used to avoid edge smoothing within the contours .    in the present model ,",
    "the nl - means are used based on nonlocal information of weighted pixels .",
    "these weights are computed using the similarity criterion defined by gestalt - grouping principles @xcite . in the nonlocal method ,",
    "all image pixels can be considered as neighboring pixels .",
    "the nonlocal mean of an image is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalization factor and @xmath32 is the weighting factor between the central pixel and the neighboring pixels gained by criteria including brightness similarity and geometric proximity @xcite .    by using the mean of nonlocal weights instead of the local mean in equation ( [ lmu ] ) ,",
    "the image model is modified as    [ wmu ] _",
    "k(*r * ) m_k , & if @xmath20 , + _ * r*_*r * _ * r*,*r*x_*r * , & if @xmath21 .    thus , the image intensity model is represented as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the constant that controls the influence of the likelihood model on the output . by increasing @xmath34 , the value of likelihood probability decreases , and _",
    "vice versa_.      we employed an mrf framework to obtain different prior spatial models to model the labels .",
    "mrf consists of a set of random variables @xmath35 such that every one of the random variables @xmath36 arises from a discrete set @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "each random variable @xmath36 and its neighborhoods @xmath22 is considered a clique .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath38 is included in the gibbs distribution as follows @xcite : @xmath39 the energy function @xmath40 and the probability value @xmath41 correspond to different configurations of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the random variables are considered as labels corresponding with regions . using the potts model , the energy function",
    "is defined as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a coefficient that controls the rate of smoothness ( the amount of connections created among labels ) . using equations ( [ pf ] ) and ( [ uz ] ) ,",
    "the probability function of the potts model can be expressed as @xmath44 if the smoothness in segmentation increases , the probability value shows the growth in its distribution . choosing a greater value for @xmath43 causes loss of segmentation details , and the selection of lower values may lead to increased noise @xcite .",
    "for nonlocal information , the probability can be expressed as @xcite @xmath45      the labels of pixels @xmath46 and hyperparameters @xmath47 can be obtained by solving the following equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the probability model of the set of unknown parameters . using gibbs sampling @xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are obtained in the iteration loop as follows @xmath50 @xmath51 according to this sampler , the @xmath52-th sample of @xmath53 is obtained from equation ( [ zmcmc ] ) .",
    "then , we use it in equation ( [ tmcmc ] ) to sample @xmath54 , and _ vice versa_. this iterative way must be continued until @xmath55 is related to the precision of segmentation . for more details about estimating all the unknown parameters we refer to humblot and djafari ( 2006 ) , and murphy ( 2007 ) .",
    "the cellular learning automata method , a mathematical model for complex dynamical systems consisting of numerous simple elements , was exploited to estimate labels @xcite .",
    "each cell sends an output ( action ) @xmath56 to its surroundings and then receives an input response @xmath57 .",
    "the probability of choosing each action in the @xmath52-th iteration is expressed by the action probability @xmath58 . in other words ,",
    "when the cell receives a desired response input @xmath59 , the action for automaton @xmath60 , which is denoted by @xmath61 , is rewarded ; for another possible input @xmath62 , it is penalized @xcite . in cla ,",
    "input @xmath63 is determined by the current output ( action ) of neighbors of each cell . here , pixels are equivalent to cells , and actions are comparable with labels . for the label of each pixel ,",
    "all probabilities of the number of actions applied to each pixel are calculated . in other words , the greater the value of action probability of each label , the higher the selection probability of the label .",
    "the label of each pixel in each iteration is attained by @xmath64 where the function indmax returns the index corresponding with the highest value that can be interpreted as the label of the pixel , and @xmath65 is a random number ranging from 0 to 1 assigned to @xmath15-th selection probability .",
    "the potts model can be regarded as a ca that is able to specify the posterior probability of labels @xmath66 for each cell based on two criteria : markov dependence ( image model ) and similarity between each cell and its neighbors ( labels model ) . on the basis of the mentioned assumptions",
    ", we must consider the desired input response ( label ) , @xmath59 obtained from the action increasing the posterior probability ; on the other hand , @xmath62 reduces the probability @xcite .    in @xmath52-th iteration ,",
    "the probability related with the value of the label @xmath67 is reinforced .",
    "thus , the probability related to @xmath67 is reinforced in matrix @xmath68 ( a @xmath69 matrix in which the element @xmath70 shows the assignment probability of the @xmath15-th label to the @xmath71-th pixel ) . by computing @xmath68 , the final label ,",
    "@xmath72 is given as @xmath73",
    "the proposed method was applied to solar data that have mainly been recorded at two wavelengths ( 171 and 193  ) .",
    "it is a well - established fact that ars can be identified better at 171  , and on the other hand , the preferred wavelength for ch recognition is 193  . to improve image segmentations , we here extracted the optimized values for parameters @xmath34 and @xmath43 specified in equations ( [ nlmgm ] ) and ( [ finalbeta ] ) , respectively .",
    "we determined regions in one computational loop with @xmath52 iterations with the condition given in equation ( [ epsilon ] ) . here",
    ", we decided that the parameter @xmath74 equals 30 pixels for images of size 1024 @xmath75 1024 pixels to obtain great precision .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows different numbers of iterations applied to 171   data to segment ars .",
    "it can be seen that ars are gradually recognized in higher - order iteration .",
    "certain performances of both ar and ch identification reach their final value in the 400-th and 1200-th iteration , respectively .    in the next step ,",
    "200 images recorded ( from 2010 to 2013 ) at two wavelengths were randomly selected .",
    "ars and chs were manually extracted from 171 and 193   images , respectively .",
    "the code with different values of @xmath34 and @xmath43 was applied to these data to distinguish regions .",
    "the two segmented images ( manual selection approach and proposed method ) were compared on a pixel - by - pixel basis , measuring the proportion of equally segmented pixels .",
    "for example , if a pixel is segmented as an ar in both results , it is assigned a score (= 1 ) ; if a pixel is segmented as non - ar in both results , it is assigned a score (= 1 ) ; if a pixel is segmented as ar in one result and as non - ar in the other result , it is assigned a score (= 0 ) .",
    "then , the summation of scores is divided by the number of pixels of the disk .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] demonstrates the mean value of the summations for 100 images at each wavelength for different values of @xmath34 and @xmath43 .",
    "since this segmentation method is the result of a random markovian process , some negligible changes appeared in the resulting segmented images in each running code .",
    "the optimal values for the set ( @xmath34 , @xmath43 ) are obtained to equal ( 0.13 , 1.81 ) and ( 0.97 , 0.31 ) for ars and chs , respectively .    to estimate the reliability of the algorithm and to compare it to the spoca results , we picked up full - disk sdo / aia images recorded on 25 june 2011 ( 13:00:36 ut ) and 28 july 2011 ( 13:00:37 ut ) taken at 171 ( figures [ fig4]a , and [ fig5]a ) and 193   ( figures [ fig4]b , and [ fig5]b ) .",
    "first , we manually extracted ars ( figures [ fig4]c , and [ fig5]c ) and chs ( figures [ fig4]d , and [ fig5]d ) . for comparison , the performance of the spoca results in the hek catalog @xcite represented at 171   ( figures [ fig4]e , and [ fig5]e ) and 193   ( figures [ fig4]f , and [ fig5]f ) are shown . then , our method was applied on these two wavelengths to extract ars ( figures [ fig4]g , and [ fig5]g ) and chs ( figures [ fig4]h , and [ fig5]h ) with the optimal values of ( @xmath34 , @xmath43 ) .    to exclude bright features appearing as bright points , very slender coronal loops @xcite resolving out of ars , etc .",
    ", the minimum sizes for ars and chs were considered to be 1400 and 3000 arcsec@xmath76 , respectively , close to the values in verbeeck _ et al . _",
    "the method clearly is able to separate regions of interest with high precision .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] presents more samples at 171   ( first row ) and 193   ( third row ) .",
    "the recognition of ars and chs are displayed with red ( second row ) and green contours ( last row ) , respectively .",
    "columns are representative of data recorded on 22 january 2011 ( left column ) , 24 february 2011 ( middle column ) , and 31 march 2011 ( right column ) .    to investigate the statistics of coronal regions , the code was applied to a dataset of 12 months ranging from 1 january to 31 december 2011 . at 171 and 193",
    "   an image for each day at each wavelength was selected .",
    "the filling factors of ar , ch , and qs are shown with mean values of 0.032 , 0.057 , and 0.911 , respectively ( figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations ( the solar rotation of about 27 days ) are compatible with corresponding results obtained by verbeeck _",
    "( 2014 ) for 2011 . the total number of ars and chs extracted by our code for 2011 equal 3580 and 3275 , respectively .",
    "the number of ars and chs on each day with the mean value of 9.8 and 8.9 , respectively , are shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the correlation ( pearson ) between these two time series is about zero .",
    "brightness fluctuations of ars , chs , and qs with their variances during 2011 are illustrated in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "the mean brightness value of ars is 20 and five times as much as that calculated for chs and qs , respectively .",
    "the variance in the brightness of ar is about 200 times more than that computed for the brightness of qs , which is expected to be indicative of their activity .",
    "the size  frequency distribution of ars ( figure [ fig10 ] , upper panel ) and chs ( figure [ fig10 ] , lower panel ) are displayed in log - log scale .",
    "we used a data - based method to determine the optimal bin number within histograms .",
    "this optimization method is based on the minimizing loss function between the histogram and an unknown density function by adopting the mean integrated squared error @xcite .",
    "we used the maximum likelihood estimator method @xcite to compute the power - law exponents of size  frequency distributions .",
    "the power - law exponents @xmath34 , which is shown as slope of linear fit ( dashed line ) in figure [ fig10 ] , are equal to -1.597@xmath770.025 and -1.508@xmath770.028 for ars and chs , respectively , with 97 @xmath78 confidence levels in fitting .",
    "the scatter plots of ars ( figure [ fig11 ] , left panel ) and chs ( figure [ fig11 ] , right panel ) with mean values for each bin ( 01800 arcsec@xmath76 , 18003600 arcsec@xmath76 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) are presented .",
    "both small ars and chs have excessive scatter in brightness .    to check the influence of noise on the segmentation of data taken on 6 february 2013 ( 12:08:30 ut ) with the optimized values of ( @xmath34 , @xmath43 ) , was used the zero - mean gaussian noise .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s@xmath1n ) can be obtained by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the standard deviations of the pixel intensity and noise , respectively . in a similar manner , s@xmath1n is formulated in decibels as @xmath82 to evaluate the segmentation error , we calculated the percentage of pixels that were differently classified in the case of artificial noise , when compared to the segmentation without noise in the same way described above for figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "thus , the segmentation error for ars ( figure [ fig12 ] , left panel ) and chs ( figure [ fig12 ] , right panel ) , which was applied to data recorded on 6 february 2013 in different values of s@xmath1n was calculated when zero - mean gaussian noise was added to the data . as expected , the influence of noise on the segmentation of ars is weaker than that of chs .",
    "we can see that in the lower values of s@xmath1n , the result of segmentation is unpredictable .",
    "the filling factors of ars ( figure [ fig13 ] , left panel ) and chs ( figure [ fig13 ] , right panel ) within 50 images , which were selected randomly from 20102012 , were extracted using both a manual selection approach and our automatic method for the optimized values of @xmath83 noted in figure [ fig3 ] . by comparing these two results on a pixel - by - pixel basis , we noted some false - positive detections .",
    "here , we presented a hybrid algorithm defined in a bayesian framework based on the mgm and potts model . then , cellular learning automata were employed to sample labels from their posterior probability .",
    "the proposed algorithm was applied to coronal full - disk sdo / aia data to subdivide areas into regions of interest . by applying this code to various types of solar data on different days",
    ", its flexibility and capability in separating regions were tested .    in figure [ fig11 ]",
    "we show that chs with sizes smaller than 5000 arcsec@xmath76 are more scattered in brightness , and for large sizes , fluctuations in brightness decrease . for small ch regions , the average brightness increases .",
    "this shows that the influence of the border pixels that are located next to the qs and especially in the vicinity of the ars becomes important . for large ch regions",
    ", the average brightness shows less scattering .",
    "most probably , the false - positive detection error of the code ( figure [ fig13 ] , right panel ) affects the average value of brightness for some ch regions .",
    "as expected , the segmentation of chs is more sensitive to noise than the segmentation of ars .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to take preprocessing steps before recognizing chs .",
    "this method can be improved to restore and segment simultaneously to retrieve coronal regions .",
    "it will also be better to revise our code to use two or three wavelengths to characterize ars and chs .    in the future",
    ", we will try to establish a reliable criterion for determining border pixels of ars and chs , based on mean and standard deviation .",
    "moreover , we intend to revise this algorithm to extract regions of interest from photospheric and@xmath1or chromospheric data",
    ". then , we aim to investigate the evolution and variations of different types of regions in a number of wavelengths in half a solar cycle .",
