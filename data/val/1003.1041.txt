    "nowadays the holographic approach to qcd is a common tool for exploring the strong interaction properties at nonperturbative region .",
    "there is a number of models @xcite , which can reproduce meson decay constants , regge trajectories of meson masses , phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking and chiral anomaly , confinement of quarks etc . at the same time",
    "the model which would incorporate all these features simultaneously , does not exist .",
    "although holographic models can not yet provide a precise calculation tool , they can give some new hints about the nature of the considered phenomena and reveal the connection between different features of the theory .",
    "moreover , the features of the model should be studied to clarify the further modifications .",
    "the paper concerns the calculation of the 4-point correlator of vector currents of qcd in the framework of the holographic model containing the vector , axial vector , scalar and dilaton dynamical fields .",
    "similar strong coupling calculations were made in different models , where the photon correlators in supersymmetric yang - mills or conformal qcd @xcite and various features of low energy qcd @xcite were studied .",
    "we assume that scalar and dilaton field have some arbitrary background profiles , moreover we incorporate the arbitrary deformation function of the metric in the infrared region .",
    "thus we get the result , applicable to a large class of particular holographic models which appear in the literature . for the perturbative calculation",
    "we adopt a convenient witten diagram technique to represent the action on the classical solutions as the sum of tree diagrams .",
    "the second goal of this work is to study the electric current magnetic susceptibility , namely the electric current two - point function in the external magnetic field at vanishing momentum .",
    "this entity may be related to the measured charge asymmetry in heavy ion collisions at rhic experiment @xcite , and is studied extensively . according to @xcite , the susceptibility is generated in the moment of collision by the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral chemical potential .",
    "the other input is produced by the nonzero temperature of the fireball .",
    "we study this object at zero temperature and zero chiral chemical potential . though this setting is not sufficient to study the phenomena in the ion collision , we try to find out if any other origins of current susceptibility are present in nonperturbative qcd .",
    "we see that the susceptibility in the holographic model is nonzero at quadratic order in the field , and it is directly related to the 4-point correlator computed in the first part .    as the main result",
    "we make some conclusions about the behaviour of the quantity of interest .",
    "it turns out that the susceptibility at zero temperature behaves as @xmath0 at small @xmath1 .",
    "it is not very sensitive to the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking present in the model , namely it is nonzero even when the quark mass and condensate are taken as zero , but depends strongly on the way the conformal symmetry is violated , or of the confinement properties .    as to the perturbation theory in the bulk space of ads / qcd ,",
    "we find that usually the exchange of the dilaton makes no difference being suppressed by the factor of @xmath2 .",
    "also we find that the exponential growth of the bulk - to - bulk propagators in the soft wall model with positive dilaton makes the perturbation theory there inconsistent .    in section 2 we present the setting we are working in , describe the principles of the diagram technique and calculate the four - point function of the electromagnetic currents . in section 3",
    "we use this result to compute the electric current susceptibility in various models and investigate its dependence on the parameters .",

    "we study the dynamics of the fluctuations of scalar field around its vacuum profile @xmath15 , represented by the pseudoscalar field @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that only axial vector field interacts with this background is a sign of the chiral symmetry breaking in the model .",
    "the dilaton field can have a vacuum profile as well .",
    "we will denote it by @xmath18 and consider the fluctuations @xmath19 . in the following it",
    "is convenient to introduce the sum of the warp factor and dilaton vacuum profile : @xmath20 .",
    "the pure yang - mills part is symmetrical with respect to the exchange of left and right currents , the cs part is anti symmetrical . @xmath21 here the trace is taken over the gauge group @xmath10 , @xmath22 is a normalization constant of dilaton field , which should be fixed .",
    "@xmath23 is a possible potential for dilaton , which is not essential in our calculation , as long as we are not interested in the gluon condensate corrections .",

    "this can be done by matching with qcd sum rule result for the gluon correlator @xcite @xmath26 in order to compute this correlator in the holographic model it is enough to solve the linearized equation of motion for the dilaton near the boundary of ads @xmath27 the solution ( bulk - to - boundary propagator ) is @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the modified bessel functions , and @xmath31 is a boundary value of dilaton field , which should be associated with the source of corresponding operator in the generating functional of 4d theory , namely @xmath32 .",

    "one can check , that at @xmath91 limit @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so in the integral ( [ jjb ] ) only differentials of propagators remain , which result in the overall factor of @xmath0 .",
    "now we can calculate the integral numerically . for the parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ( see appendix of @xcite ) we obtain : @xmath104 the value of the integral here is computed numerically , it is dimensionful and warrants some more study . in the hard wall model we have 3 dimensionful parameters : @xmath25,@xmath105 and @xmath90 .",
    "one can check , that the quark mass has very little influence on the result , so we can freely take the chiral limit ( @xmath106 ) with the change of about 1% .",
    "the @xmath105 plays a bigger part , but it is also not crucial for the result . taking it equal to zero gives the value @xmath107 and larger @xmath105 decreases this number until at very large @xmath108 the integral practically vanishes .",
    "important for us is that the current correlator in the external field is nonzero even in the chiral limit and at zero chiral condensate .",
    "this indicates , that its origin is not the chiral symmetry breaking . in the case of @xmath109",
    "the result obviously behaves as @xmath110 , or @xmath111 , so taking the scale parameter to infinity kills the result as well .",
    "but concerning the limit @xmath112 we do not find such a smooth behaviour as in the case of condensate . in this limit",
    "the integral diverges strongly , which is a sign of qualitative dependence on the @xmath113 .",
    "this lets us conclude , that the most important for the considered value feature of the model is the ir cut - off the ads space , related to the confinement or conformal symmetry breaking .    according to this issue it is interesting to study the `` soft - wall '' model , because it has an improved behaviour in the ir which includes the proper description of the meson masses @xcite .",
    "moreover , we are not very interested in chiral symmetry braking , which is problematic in considered framework ( see @xcite ) . in this model",
    "one has an exponential factor @xmath114 in the action , due to the nontrivial dilaton profile @xmath115 @xcite or to the deformation of the metric @xmath116 @xcite . in our case",
    "this makes no difference , because it is their sum @xmath88 which appears in equations of motion .",
    "the most popular version of the `` soft - wall '' model has negative @xmath117 @xcite , so that the action has a rapidly falling prefactor @xmath118 .",
    "this gives rise to the strong problem in our calculation , because the bulk - to - bulk propagator , being the inverse of the kinetic term in the action , acquires a factor @xmath119 and diverges extremely fast at large @xmath120 .",
    "this makes the diagram under consideration ( [ vv - a - vv ] ) diverge too , because the vertices coming from the chern - simons term do not have any exponential suppression , due to the independence of metric and dilaton . as a consequence , one can not use the perturbation theory here .",
    "this problem is not surprising , since the model with negative @xmath117 does not express the confinement ( namely the proper heavy quark potential ) crucial for our computation @xcite .    in order to incorporate the confinement",
    ", one has to use the model with positive @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "then all the solutions to equations of motion decay in ir as well as the bulk - to - bulk propagator .",
    "so the perturbation calculation converges and we can get the striking result : @xmath121 it is nonzero at @xmath122 , what seems to be quite unphysical in the framework of zero temperature and absence of any chemical potentials . the reason is the presence of the unphysical massless mode in the vector sector in the model with positive @xmath117 , which has been observed in @xcite and discussed in @xcite .",
    "this feature prevents us from trusting the answer above , until the nature of this mode is clarified .",
    "in this work we ve performed a perturbative 5d calculation of the vector current four - point function of qcd via the holographic model .",
    "the generality of the used setting allows us to study some common features of such calculations in various ads / qcd models .",
    "namely we find , that due to the normalisation of dilaton field , the exchange of dilaton in the bulk is suppressed by the factor of @xmath2 . even though the form of the dilaton field and its features in holography are still subjects of investigation , we claim , that this behaviour has to remain in all the models .",
    "the obtained result is applicable to a large class of commonly used holographic models and can be used in various problems , as it includes the chiral symmetry breaking term , the anomaly term , the arbitrary number of quark flavors , the arbitrary dilaton and scalar potentials and the arbitrary warp factor in the metric .",
    "we use the vector current four - point function to calculate the two - point correlator of electromagnetic currents in the external magnetic field .",
    "this quantity turns out to be weakly dependent on the chiral symmetry breaking in the model and is sensitive to its infrared behaviour , namely to the way the conformal symmetry is broken . studying this calculation in the hard wall ads / qcd model and soft wall models with different dilaton behaviour , we find that the perturbation theory is divergent in the soft wall model with falling exponent in the action .",
    "this problem is not visible until every term of the action , including interactions , is multiplied by the same factor . but",
    "considering the chern - simons action , which is free of metric as well as dilaton input , we get the exponentially growing bulk - to - bulk propagator , not suppressed by the interaction vertices and leading to the strong divergence of the result .",
    "this turns to a handicap for calculating diagrams with bulk - to - bulk propagators and chern - simons vertices in such a framework . in the model with growing exponent in the action",
    "we obtain the value , finite in the limit of small @xmath1 , which is unphysical at zero temperature .",
    "this results from the presence of the massless pole in the vector two - point function , which leads to the violation of charge conservation and is forbidden in qcd .",
    "we hope , that the nature of this pole and the solution of this defect will allow more accurate calculations in this model .    in the end of the day we obtain the best result in the framework of the `` hard - wall '' model .",
    "the value of the correlator in the magnetic field is proportional to @xmath123 at small @xmath124 , where @xmath124 is the field strength . at small @xmath1",
    "it goes to zero as @xmath0 , what is consistent with general expectations at zero temperature and chemical potentials .",
    "this confirms that the holographic model , featuring chiral symmetry breaking and chiral anomaly , does not autonomously develop the chiral chemical potential , needed for the nonzero result .",
    "some other components are obviously necessary to describe the phenomena of heavy ion collisions . constructing a holographic model which would feature nonzero temperature and topological charge of qcd",
