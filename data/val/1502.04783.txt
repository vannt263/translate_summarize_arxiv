    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are widely accepted to be old neutron stars that were spun up through mass accretion from the companions when they were at the low - mass x - ray binary phase @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath460% known msps are in binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a sub - class of them , so - called ` black widow ' pulsar systems @xcite , have very low - mass , @xmath20.02@xmath5 companions .",
    "to form isolated msps , one possible channel is through ablation of the companions by the pulsar wind .",
    "this possibility likely occurs in the black widows since they are eclipsing systems at radio frequencies , indicating the interaction between the pulsar wind and the companions .",
    "x - ray observations of them revealed orbital flux variations , also supporting the presence of the intrabinary interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent extensive studies of the so - called ` redback ' systems @xcite have provided clear evidence for the interaction .",
    "these redbacks are also eclipsing msp binaries , but contain relative massive , @xmath20.10.6@xmath5 companions .",
    "x - ray observations of the prototypical redback psr j1023 + 0038 detected significant orbital flux variations @xcite , and the variations can be explained by the existence of an intrabinary shock region @xcite .",
    "similar features were also clearly seen in the redback xss j12270@xmath14859 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "owing to its all - sky monitoring and high sensitivity capabilities , the _ fermi _  gamma - ray space telescope , launched in 2008 , has greatly improved our studies of pulsars . for msps , more than six - fold black widows and redbacks have been discovered with the help of _ fermi _  ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at _ fermi _",
    "s 100mev to 300gev energy range , marginal evidence for the intrabinary interaction in the eclipsing systems has also been seen .",
    "for the first discovered black widow psr b1957@xmath620 @xcite , an orbital modulation signal was detected at a @xmath7 confidence level @xcite .",
    "in addition , possible signals were also reported for xss j12270@xmath14859 @xcite and a candidate redback 2fgl j0523.3@xmath12530 @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have long predicted the intrabinary interaction and related high - energy emission from black widows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the @xmath0-ray  emission from the intrabinary region allow us to explore the detailed physical processes within such a binary ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we report the detection of orbitally modulated @xmath0-ray  emission from a recently discovered black widow psr j1311@xmath13430 , which thus indicates the intrabinary origin for part of its emission .",
    "psr j1311@xmath13430  was initially listed as an unassociated source in the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) source catalog ( 2fgl j1311.7@xmath13429 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is the only @xmath0-ray  selected msp with @xmath0-ray  pulsed emission discovered via a direct blind search in the _ fermi _  data @xcite .",
    "the pulsed radio emission soon was detected too @xcite , but the signal was visible only during @xmath810% of the observation time , suggesting strong variations in the intrabinary medium . before the discovery , the source was found to have orbital modulation with a short period of @xmath994 minutes through optical imaging and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "considering its properties of weak x - ray emission , sinusoid - like optical modulation and large modulation amplitude , it was already suggested to be a black widow system and the optical modulation is caused by irradiation of the companion by the pulsar wind @xcite . marginal modulated x - ray emission possibly related to the intrabinary shock",
    "has also been detected @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  discovery of the 2.56 ms spin signal thus confirmed its black widow nature @xcite . analyzing the _ fermi _  data",
    ", we searched and found the orbital modulation signal from the source s offpulse emission .",
    "below we present the data analysis and results in section  [ sec : ana ] .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we selected 0.1300 gev lat events from the _ fermi _ pass 7 reprocessed ( p7rep ) database inside a @xmath10 region centered at the position of psr j1311@xmath13430  @xcite during the time period from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 to 2015 - 01 - 06 21:19:57 ( utc ) .",
    "only events with zenith angle less than 100deg and during good time intervals were kept .",
    "the former prevents the earth s limb contamination , and for the latter , the quality of the data was not affected by the spacecraft events .",
    "we performed timing analysis to the 0.1300 gev lat data of the psr j1311@xmath13430  region to update the @xmath0-ray  ephemeris given in @xcite .",
    "an aperture radius of 10 was used .",
    "we determined the pulse time of arrivals ( toas ) by obtaining the pulse profiles of 40 evenly divided segments using the known ephemeris @xcite and cross - correlated them with a template profile created with data during the time period of mjd 5468256119 ( the same time range as that in @xcite ) , following the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "we used tempo2 @xcite to fit the toas .",
    "only pulse frequency @xmath11 and frequency derivative @xmath12 were fitted , and the other timing parameters were fixed to their known values .",
    "we obtained @xmath13hz and @xmath14s@xmath15 , consistent with the values given in @xcite within @xmath20.5@xmath3 and @xmath22.2@xmath3 uncertainties , respectively .",
    "the folded pulse profile and two - dimensional phaseogram are shown in figure  [ fig : timing ] .",
    "we defined phase 0.160.66 and 0.661.16 as the onpulse and offpulse phase intervals , respectively .",
    "we selected lat events in 0.1300gev energy range for the likelihood analysis , and included all sources within 20 deg in the _ fermi _ third source catalog @xcite centered at the position of psr j1311@xmath13430  to make the source model .",
    "the spectral function forms of the sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "the spectral parameters of the sources within 5 deg from psr j1311@xmath13430  were set free , and all other parameters of the sources were fixed at their catalog values .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  counterpart of psr j1311@xmath13430  was modeled with an exponentially cutoff power law , characteristic for pulsars @xcite , and a simple power law for comparison .",
    "in addition , we used the spectrum model gll_iem_v05_rev1.fits and the spectrum file iso_source_v05.txt to consider the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission , respectively .        using the lat science tools software package v9r33p0 , we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  emission during the total pulse phase interval was detected with a test statistic ( ts ) value of 6279 , while that during the onpulse and offpulse phase intervals were detected with ts values of 7723 and 499 , respectively .",
    "the ts value at a specific position is calculated from ts@xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the maximum likelihood values for a model without and with an additional source respectively , and approximately is the square of the detection significance for the additional source @xcite .",
    "we found during the total pulse phase , onpulse phase , and offpulse phase intervals , the emission is better modeled by an exponentially cutoff power law , with the low energy cutoff detected with @xmath413@xmath3 , @xmath414@xmath3 , and @xmath45@xmath3 significance ( estimated from @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the maximum likelihood values for the exponentially cutoff power - law model and power - law model , respectively ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting exponentially cutoff power - law fits are summarized in table  [ tab : likelihood ] .",
    "we folded the lat events of the psr j1311@xmath13430  region at its orbital period ( @xcite ) to study its possible orbital modulations . the source position given in @xcite",
    "was used for the barycentric corrections to photon arrival times , and photons within r@xmath22 ( r@xmath22 ranges from 0110 with a step of 01 ) from the position were collected .",
    "different energy ranges ( 0.1300 , 0.2300 , 0.3300 , 0.5 - 300 , 1300 gev ) were tested in folding .",
    "no significant modulations were detected using the whole data ( i.e. , during the total pulse phase ) , as the largest h - test value was 6 ( corresponding to @xmath82@xmath3 detection significance ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , a significant orbital signal was best revealed using the offpulse data in the @xmath40.2 gev energy range within 04 from psr j1311@xmath13430 . the folded light curve , which has an h - test value of @xmath222 ( corresponding to @xmath24@xmath3 significance and @xmath23@xmath3 post - trial significance , for the latter where 50 trials on the energy range and aperture radius are considered ) , is shown in figure  [ fig : orbital ] .",
    "the phase zero is at the ascending node of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the folded light curve has a brightness peak around the superior conjunction ( when the companion is behind the pulsar ) , the same as the modest x - ray one reported in @xcite .",
    "the similarity helps strengthen the @xmath0-ray  modulation detection . using the lat tool gtexposure , we checked the summed exposures over the 10 orbital phase bins ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and they had only @xmath81% differences , too small to cause any artificial orbital modulations .",
    "we performed likelihood analysis to the @xmath40.2 gev offpulse lat events during the orbital phase ranges of 0.20.5 ( named phase i ) and 0.71.0 ( named phase ii ) , which were approximately defined for the bottom and peak of the orbital modulation , respectively .",
    "we found that the emission during the both phase ranges is better modeled by an exponentially cutoff power law , with low energy cutoff detected with @xmath43@xmath3 and @xmath42@xmath3 significance .",
    "the exponentially cutoff power - law fits are summarized in table  [ tab : likelihood ] .",
    "the ts values during phase i and ii are @xmath2120 and @xmath2320 ( see figure  [ fig : tsmap - orbital ] ) , respectively , which indicate that the source during the latter is more significantly detected than during the former , confirming the detection of orbital modulation from photon folding .    possible contamination from a nearby catalog source 3fgl j1316.0@xmath13338 , which is identified as the counterpart to the flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) pks 1313@xmath1333 @xcite , was investigated .",
    "this source , being only @xmath212 away from psr j1311@xmath13430  and relatively bright ( ts@xmath9625 in the catalog ) , exhibited flaring events in the past . using the offpulse data and performing likelihood analysis , we extracted its 30-day interval light curve , and found that for five time bins ( mjd 5486354923 , mjd 5543355493 , mjd 56363 - 56393 ) , it had fluxes @xmath42@xmath3 above the value obtained from the total offpulse data .",
    "we repeated the analysis by excluding the data of the time bins .",
    "we found that the folded light curve is nearly the same , still having an h - test value of @xmath922 .",
    "we further investigated the orbital - dependent spectral variability during the offpulse phase interval .",
    "spectra of psr j1311@xmath13430  during the whole offpulse phase interval , phase i , and phase ii were obtained , and the spectrum during the onpulse phase interval was also obtained for comparison .",
    "we extracted the spectra by performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 10 evenly divided energy bins in logarithm from 0.1300 gev , with the emission of the source being modeled with a power law in each energy bin .",
    "we only kept spectral points with ts@xmath234 , and derived the 95% upper limits in other energy bins .",
    "the spectra extracted by this method are less model - dependent and provide a detailed description of the @xmath0-ray  emission for the source .",
    "the obtained spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] . the onpulse emission appears to have a 3-times higher cutoff energy @xmath24 than the offpulse one ( see also table  [ tab : likelihood ] ) .",
    "in addition , comparing the two offpulse spectra , the source was brighter across the @xmath40.2 gev energy range during phase ii than during phase i.    we also repeated the analysis by excluding the data when the nearby source 3fgl  j1316.0@xmath13338 had possible flares ( see   [ subsec : ov ] ) .",
    "the obtained spectral parameters of psr j1311@xmath13430  during the two orbital - phase ranges are consistent with the values obtained above ( within 1@xmath3 uncertainties ) .",
    "we concluded that the flares do not have any significant effect on our spectral analysis .",
    "however , we note that in the lowest energy bin , the two upper limits of the phase i and ii spectra ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) are lower than the exponentially cutoff power - law fits . this problem might be due to possible contamination from 3fgl  j1316.0@xmath13338 in the low - energy range .",
    "from our analysis of the _ fermi _ data of psr j1311@xmath13430 , we have detected its @xmath0-ray  orbital modulation during the offpulse phase interval of the pulsar , where the magnetospheric emission from the pulsar was likely effectively removed . in both optical and x - ray observations ,",
    "flares were detected @xcite , indicating the strong interaction between the pulsar wind and the companion .",
    "likely @xmath0-rays are also produced due to the intrabinary interaction .",
    "however , different from that is seen in psr b1957@xmath620 , which has an extra component above 2.7gev at its inferior conjunction ( when the companion is in front of the pulsar ) , the light curve peak is near the superior conjunction for psr j1311@xmath13430 .",
    "the difference suggests that the intrabinary @xmath0-ray  emission model , which explains the extra component as the result from viewing an inverse compton process as a head - on collision ( see also @xcite ) , proposed in @xcite does not apply here .    for psr j1311@xmath13430",
    ", no significant spectral changes were found from the offpulse orbital - phase  resolved spectra ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the source appeared brighter across the @xmath40.2 gev energy range during the peak range ( phase ii ) than during the bottom range ( phase i ) .",
    "although the uncertainties from our fits with the exponentially cutoff power law are relatively large , the two spectra are generally similar to each other .",
    "the similarity suggests an geometric origin for the orbital modulation , such as that used to explain the x - ray orbital modulation of psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite .",
    "the binary likely has an inclination angle of @xmath2560 , and the companion has a very small roche lobe radius @xmath26 ( a canonical neutron star mass @xmath27 is assumed ) .",
    "therefore like in psr j1023 + 0038 , the intrabinary emission region must be very close to the companion and the companion can thus block part of the region , causing the observed orbital modulation . here",
    "we simply assume that the region is at the inner surface of the companion , and use a function @xmath28/2+m_c$ ] to describe the orbital modulation , where @xmath29 is the orbital phase , @xmath30 is fixed , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the modulation amplitude ( in units of counts ) and constant counts , respectively . fitting the folded light curve , we found this function can describe the modulation ( see figure  [ fig : orbital ] ) , where the minimum @xmath33 ( for 8 degrees of freedom ) and @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "examining the light curve , the minimum and maximum may have a 0.1 phase shift ( i.e. , they occur at phase 0.35 and 0.85 , respectively ) .",
    "if we force such a shift , the results are @xmath36 ( for 8 degrees of freedom ) and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , indeed slightly better .",
    "this shift may suggest that the emission is not isotropic .",
    "the constant part @xmath32 may represent the intrabinary emission unblocked by the companion over the whole orbital phase , while emission from the pulsar during its offpulse phase interval could also contribute a small fraction .",
    "it is not clear why psr j1311@xmath13430  has an orbital modulation different from that of psr b1957 + 20 .",
    "we note that if the size of the interaction region is proportional to that of a companion , similar fractions of an isotropic pulsar wind ( 0.0021 vs. 0.0024 ) would be intercepted for psr j1311@xmath13430  and psr b1957 + 20 respectively ( estimated from @xmath39 ; @xmath40 is the radius of the companion and @xmath41 is the separation distance of the binary ) .",
    "the notable differences are that the spin - down luminosity of psr j1311@xmath13430  is approximately 1/3 of psr b1957 + 20 and that the companion in psr j1311@xmath13430   nearly fills its roche lobe @xcite .",
    "we suspect that because of the latter , an outflow from the companion may still exist , the same as that in psr j1023 + 0038 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for psr b1957 + 20 , its companion fills its roche lobe @xmath42 @xcite , and the mass loss from the companion is presumably driven by the pulsar wind ( @xcite and references therein ) . the much more messy environment in psr j1311@xmath13430 , as suggested by the radio observations @xcite , could be evidence for this possibility . detailed modeling for physical processes in psr j1311@xmath13430  would help verify it .    our discovery of the orbital @xmath0-ray  modulation in psr j1311@xmath13430  and the analysis results have provided clear evidence for @xmath0-ray  production due to intrabinary interaction between a pulsar and its companion in a black widow system , and thus have confirmed the general physical picture that has long been proposed theoretically . since x - ray observations have revealed the general existence of intrabinary shock emission in eclipsing msp binaries , similar work can be carried out to search and study related @xmath0-ray  emission from these recently identified systems .",
