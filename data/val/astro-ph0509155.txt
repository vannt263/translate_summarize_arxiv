    "there are currently @xmath10 galaxies in which a supermassive black hole ( bh ) has been directly measured using stellar and gas dynamics ( e.g. , reviews by barth 2004 and kormendy 2004 ) . with a large number of secure detections",
    ", several correlations have been discovered between the mass of the bhs and the global properties of the galaxy bulge , such as its stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath11 ) , mass ( ) , and luminosity ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ho 1999 ; gebhardt et al . 2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 , hring & rix 2004 ) . what makes the correlations",
    "even more striking is the relatively small amount of intrinsic scatter ; the relation between  and @xmath11 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a , and ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) has only a scatter of @xmath12 ( 0.3 dex ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) in . in the original discovery , the relationship between  and the bulge luminosity appeared weaker , with a scatter of 0.5 dex ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) . when the bulge luminosity ( ) is translated into mass",
    ", one finds that the ratio of the bh mass to the bulge mass is /  @xmath13 0.0012 ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 , merritt & ferrarese 2001 , and mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "these remarkable findings leave little room to doubt that the formation and evolution of bhs and galaxy bulges are closely tied . understanding why provides fundamental insights toward a coherent understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in general .",
    "to study the coevolution of black holes with galaxy bulges , there is a great deal of interest in investigating the correlations at higher redshifts . in this study",
    ", we explore the  versus the @xmath3-band luminosity ( ) relation of the galaxy bulge out to @xmath14 .",
    "the -  correlation has been studied by mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) , and bettoni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for @xmath15 galaxies , and is an extension of the studies pioneered by kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) and magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . since kormendy & richstone s ( 1995 ) original finding , which was based on @xmath16-band images of nearby galaxies , there have been many efforts to sharpen the correlation using larger samples and/or redder passbands ( magorrian et al . 1998 ; ho 1999 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; laor 2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; bettoni et al . 2003 ; marconi & hunt 2003 , ivanov & alonso - herrero 2003 ) .",
    "the rms scatter of the correlation , when both early- and late - type galaxies with  measurements are taken into account , is fairly large ( @xmath17 dex ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "when attention is focused on just the early - type galaxies , several studies find the scatter in the -bulge luminosity relation drops to 0.3 - 0.45 dex ( erwin , graham , & caon 2002 , mclure & dunlop 2002 ; bettoni et al . 2003 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "while it is not clear what causes the larger scatter in late - type galaxies , one of the complications is that it is not always straightforward to obtain bulge luminosities , which is hard to uniquely separate from the disk in late - type galaxies when the bulge does not have a classical de vaucouleurs profile ( e.g. carollo 1999 ) .",
    "while measuring the bulge luminosity of _ normal _ ( i.e. inactive ) galaxies is feasible out to high @xmath2 , measuring the mass of their central black holes accurately is considerably more difficult .",
    "currently , the most robust method for measuring  in normal galaxies is through modeling the stellar and gas dynamics ( e.g. , barth 2004 and kormendy 2004 ) .",
    "doing so requires an exquisite spatial resolution on the order of the bh sphere of influence , @xmath18 , the radius at which the keplerian orbital velocity of the stars due to the influence of the central bh is comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge . this is feasible only for the nearest , and often relatively luminous , galaxies .",
    "the  relation in nearby galaxies offers an easier way to infer .",
    "however , despite the potential for extending this technique widely to infer  to study bulge and bh evolution , in practice the technique is time consuming and has practical challenges : @xmath11 is difficult to measure in a variety of circumstances , including low - mass and low - surface brightness galaxies , distant galaxies , and galaxies in which the active nucleus substantially dilutes the starlight ( greene & ho 2005a ) . more fundamentally , to study the _ co_-evolution of bhs with galaxy bulges , it is desirable to measure using a technique that is more directly associated with the influence of a black hole , especially at high @xmath2 , rather than one which is tied to the bulge .    on the other hand , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , whose energetic output is a direct manifestation of supermassive black holes , are natural and promising candidates for measuring , using a technique known as the `` virial '' technique ( e.g. see ho 1999 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "this technique is based on measuring agn broad - line region ( blr ) sizes and linewidths that have been subjected to reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) .",
    "these simple  estimates appear to obey the  relation of inactive galaxies at low redshift ( @xmath19 ) ( gebhardt et al .",

    "2001 ; nelson et al .",
    "2004 , onken et al . 2004",
    "; barth , greene , & ho 2005 ; green & ho 2005b ) , which provides an important cross - check on the validity of the agn virial masses .",
    "for a sample of 34 low-@xmath2 seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars with reverberation mapping data for the h@xmath20 line , kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the blr size correlates strongly with the agn continuum luminosity .",
    "this provides a convenient shortcut to estimate bh masses essentially for any ( unbeamed ) broad - line agn with a rest - frame optical spectrum .",
    "it offers a potential to extend the measurement of  out to a large sample of objects , spanning a wide range in redshift .",
    "since then , this virial mass measurement technique has been bootstrapped to higher redshifts using the ultraviolet lines c  iv @xmath211549    ( vestergaard 2002 ) and mg  ii @xmath212798  (mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "the calibration sample , however , is small , currently based on @xmath22 objects .    using the virial mass technique ,",
    "the measurement of supermassive bhs has now been extended out to large redshifts in a large number of quasars . their numerical abundance at high redshift ( @xmath23 ) and",
    "their high luminosities make them ideal primary tracers for bh evolution , thus their host galaxies prime candidates for studying galaxy evolution .",
    "the trade - off for having an easy proxy for measuring  in quasars is that detecting quasar host galaxies is a much harder task compared with studying inactive galaxies at high @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) .",
    "the difficulty in extracting robust parameters for the host galaxy in the glare of a luminous quasar is well known .",
    "it is worth pointing out that even with the exquisite 005 resolution images of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ in the optical , the task remains nontrivial because of the small host galaxy size and its low surface brightness , which decreases as @xmath24 . despite technical challenges , careful observations are detecting more and more quasar hosts at high @xmath2 , even from the ground , using deep imaging and adaptive optics ( fynbo , burud , & mller 2002 ; lacy et al .",

    "( 2001 ) and snchez & gonzlez - serrano ( 2003 ) find that the luminosities and scale lengths of galaxies are consistent with a passively evolving scenario , and , moreover , that they follow the kormendy relation ( the correlation between half - light surface brightness @xmath26 and effective radius @xmath27 ) . therefore , in this study , we also explore the evolution in the -  relationship by testing the null - hypothesis that the host galaxies evolve like e / s0 galaxies from a formation redshift of @xmath28 .",
    "we note that at low redshift , the scatter in the -  relationship for elliptical galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2002 and bettoni et al .",
    "2003 ) is small enough that when extended to high redshift it can provide a sensitive and useful probe of the coevolution of bh masses with bulges .",

    "thus , at a given bulge mass , luminosity , and redshift , galaxies may follow a range of possible merger and luminosity evolution paths that are initially wide but progressively narrow as they evolve towards the tight local relations of versus luminosity .",
    "generalizing the idea into @xmath29-dimensional space , by measuring the  vs. luminosity relation in several passbands , this `` phase - diagram '' may indicate the state of galaxies at high redshift relative to today .",

    "the host galaxy einstein ring in ctq  414 is only modestly merged with the lensing galaxy light profile .",
    "even so , because the shape of the host galaxy einstein ring is so dramatically different azimuthally from the lensing galaxy , it is fairly easy to disentangle the two .",
    "they did so by modeling the lens deflection model , light profile of the lens , the host , and the quasar images  all simultaneously .",
    "in so doing , they find that the uncertainty of the host luminosity is roughly 0.2 mag .",

    "all the quasars in our sample have @xmath90 , with the only object , 4c  45.51 , which is radio loud , near the eddington limit .",
    "the eddington ratio spans a wide range from @xmath91 , with the top two highest efficiencies being rlqs and the bottom two being rqqs .",
    "this is probably due to a selection effect since kukula et al .",
    "( 2001 ) selected rlq and rqq quasars that are well matched in optical luminosities , but required rlqs to be extremely radio luminous ( @xmath92 jy sources , or @xmath93 to @xmath94 ) . because our sample size is small , and because a number of @xmath34 rlqs and @xmath6 rqqs are missing virial  measurements , the issue of a correlation between radio loudness and bh mass and @xmath84 , at a given redshift , can not be addressed here .",
    "we only note that such claims of a correlation are controversial even at low-@xmath2 : while several studies ( e.g. pagani , falomo , & treves 2003 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; and mclure & dunlop 2001 ) find that rlqs tend to have more massive  and more powerful quasars than rqqs at low @xmath2 , several other studies find little to no correlation ( e.g. ho 2002 ; woo & urry 2002 ; oshlack , webster , & whiting 2002 ; gu , cao , & jiang 2001 ) .      in this study , the robustness of the conclusions relies on understanding the sources for both systematic and random errors .",
    "in light of systematic errors , the best way to minimize potential doubts is to apply all known systematic errors ( by offsetting the data ) towards weakening the final conclusions .",
    "specifically , this can be done by using conversions that yield systematically _ small _  and _ bright _ host luminosities .",
    "we therefore take measures to do so , as described below . in this section",
    "we summarize the known sources of random and systematic errors , some of which are collected from previous discussions .",
    "there are several important sources of _ random _ errors when trying to interpret the scatter in the plots .",
    "in particular , the literature measurement of the emission - line widths are probably uncertain by @xmath95 due to manual measurements and complications from absorption - line features and probable fe  ii contamination .",
    "this produces roughly a random scatter of @xmath96 dex in , while lines which are absorbed in the wings may produce underestimates . the uncertainty in the  measurement using the virial technique has about 0.3 - 0.4 dex in scatter ( factor of 2.5 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , vestergaard 2002 , and mclure & jarvis 2002 , peterson et al . 2004 ) , which is also random .",
    "the uncertainties of the host galaxy magnitudes are better quantified : typically @xmath97 mag ( ridgway et al . 2001 and kukula et al .",
    "@xmath41-correction introduces both a systematic bias ( by assuming the reddest possible sed ) and a random component ( the intrinsic sed scatter of the hosts ) . in the -l@xmath83 method of estimating ,",
    "one uncertainty is in the intrinsic scatter in converting optical luminosity , using @xmath98 ) , into bolometric luminosity .",
    "this is effectively factored into the estimate of  from @xmath98 ) , shown in eq .",
    "3 . as will be evident , photometric errors ( quasar and host galaxy luminosities ) will not obfuscate the conclusions , because they are small compared to the intrinsic scatter in empirical relationships between - , and the virial technique in estimating .",
    "and the results are robust against even these random sources of error .",
    "on the other hand , the robustness of the conclusion will depend entirely on the treatment of _ systematic _ issues .",
    "we address this issue by applying known errors to the data in a way to yield a smaller  and more luminous host galaxies , thereby weakening the conclusions in the outcome .",
    "for instance , in computing the host galaxy , the main systematic error comes from the quasar removal . in ridgway",
    "et al .  ( 2001 ) they find after running simulations that the amount of over - subtraction of the host galaxy flux depends on the host morphology .",
    "thus , we choose a morphology correction that results in our hosts being typically 0.30.5 mag _ brighter _ than quoted in their study . in kukula",
    "et al .  ( 2001 ) , they perform 2-dimensional image decomposition , using a de vaucouleurs model profile to extrapolate the host both into the core and out to the wings . fortunately , assuming a de vaucouleurs profile often tends to _ overestimate _ host fluxes if the intrinsic profile is shallower , e.g. an exponential . furthermore , they hold fixed the effective radii to 510 kpc in the fit ",
    "large compared with even typical quasar hosts at @xmath1 ( i.e. measured through gravitational lensing , peng et al . in prep . ) , and lyman break galaxies ( trujillo et al .",
    "we thus feel confident about taking their host measurements at face value to be reliable upper limits . in converting to restframe @xmath3-magnitude , there are uncertainties also in the @xmath41-correction : we again decide to err on the side of overestimating the host luminosity by assuming a red sed , typical of present - day e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the difference between a red sed and a typical lyman - break galaxy sed is only about 0.3 magnitudes in restframe @xmath3 out at @xmath49 , when observed in the @xmath42-band .",
    "in addition , most of the nicmos images are not sufficiently deep to ascertain whether the hosts are bulge or disk dominated ; we attribute all the host galaxy light to the bulge , which is also a conservative assumption .",
    "the systematic errors for estimating  are managed in the following way . in particular , there is some uncertainty in the luminosity dependence ( expressed via the exponent , @xmath99 , in eqs . 1 and 2 ) of the broad line radius in using the virial mass estimators .",
    "depending on the line fitting technique used , and which sub - sample is being studied ( e.g. high - luminosity vs. low - luminosity ) @xmath99 ranges from @xmath100 , although a lower @xmath99 is preferred in the newest calibrations for the uv broad line regions ( kaspi et al .",
    "for the c  iv virial estimate , the new calibration uses a value of @xmath101 ( m.  vestergaard , private communication ) , while @xmath102 for mg  ii ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "also , in the virial  estimate (   3.1 ) there is a potential systematic error in the `` @xmath54-factor '' that normalizes the virial  to the .",

    "however , leaving it out weakens the result by 0.5 magnitude in , which , by coincidence , corresponds closely to results using the mass - luminosity relation to estimate .",
    "even this measure would leave the qualitative conclusions unchanged , especially in light of other steps we have taken to weaken the conclusions ; we will present both techniques side - by - side to emphasize this fact . in estimating bh masses using the -l@xmath83 technique , peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discuss in more depth the associated uncertainties .",
    "we note that the y - intercept , @xmath104 , of eq .",
    "3 has a significant uncertainty of @xmath105 , potentially causing a small normalization difference in mass estimates between this and the virial technique .",
    "we also do not expect the normalization for low redshift agns be identical to high redshift objects because of different selection , and perhaps physical , issues .",
    "there is one particular object , the rlq 4c  45.51 , which deviates significantly from others and it is worthwhile to discuss the relevant uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty in the bh mass is not known , because the uncertainty in measuring the fwhm is not known .",
    "if one assumes the fwhm is in error by 50% , an unlikely high error , the error in estimating  is @xmath106 dex .",
    "the potential that the quasar is beamed adds an unknown systematic error into the estimate of . for the host galaxy , kukula et al .",
    "( 2001 ) quotes a generic errorbar for the ensemble of 0.75 mag , barring small uncertainties in @xmath41-correction .",
    "all the known errors added constructively can not explain its large departure from the other data points .",
    "other indicators , such as the high eddington ratio ( @xmath107 ) and the extreme radio loudness ( @xmath93 to @xmath94 from 151 mhz to 37 ghz , e.g. wiren et al .",
    "1992 ; hales , baldwin & warner 1993 ) point to the possibility that 4c  45.51 may be an exceptional object .",
    "thus we will exclude this object from our discussions and analysis below .",
    "lastly , our conclusions rest crucially on the applicability of local virial calibrations to objects out at considerably higher redshift , @xmath49 , and that they apply for rlqs whose emission may be beamed towards us ( oshlack , webster , & whiting 2002 ; greene & ho 2005c ) .",
    "the propriety of applying these calibrations to luminous quasars is more rigorously discussed , e.g.  in netzer ( 2003 ) and vestergaard ( 2004 ) ; we point out that the luminosity range of quasars in this sample is spanned by those used to calibrate the virial relationships locally .    in summary , to mitigate against systematic errors that may complicate the interpretation ,",
    "we have added known systematic offset corrections to the data that would most weaken the conclusions .",

    "figure 1_b _ shows that the host galaxies of @xmath47 quasars are roughly as luminous as the hosts at @xmath1 for objects that have comparable ; figure 1_a _ is somewhat equivocal on this point because of the small number of points , despite the smaller scatter than in figure 1_b_. the correspondence may be fortuitous .",
    "our evolutionary scenario suggests that the @xmath6 hosts are consistent with a simple fading scenario for an e / s0 galaxy with @xmath28 , while the evolution of @xmath1 hosts may be more complex . * because /  ratio is higher in the past than today , this might suggest that the  relation has a different zeropoint earlier in time . furthermore ,",
    "if the dominant route of galaxy evolution since @xmath34 is by way of galaxy merging rather than _ in situ _ star formation , it would suggest that the  at high redshift has a _ steeper _ slope than that observed today ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . a steeper slope in the  vs. @xmath153  plot might then allow galaxies ( as they lie in fig .",
    "3 ) to grow in mass through mergers at a faster rate than the black hole mass , without evolving parallel to the local -  relation .",
    "in this study , we have tested the hypothesis that both the stellar bodies of the host galaxies and the central black holes were fully formed by @xmath28 , evolving secularly thereafter .",
    "this is motivated by the evidence that @xmath15 hosts of luminous quasars live in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1995 , and dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ) . moreover , several studies ( e.g. kukula et al .",
    "2001 , snchez & gonzlez - serrano ) argue that host galaxies as early as @xmath1 may be fully formed , early - types , undergoing passive fading .",
    "our analysis of the existing data has shown that the -  relation of high-@xmath2 quasar hosts is nearly identical to that of low-@xmath2 galaxies ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we have mostly focused our attention on @xmath14 objects . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath6 hosts do appear to deviate from the local -relationships in figure 1 , which suggests they may be fully consistent with a secularly evolving e / s0 model with @xmath28 . however , currently , this evidence is limited by small number statistics .",
    "the close agreement between @xmath1 and @xmath111 relation is surprising given that the underlying correlation seen at @xmath9 is fundamentally one between  and , and more superficially between  and bulge luminosity .",
    "there are several ramifications of this finding , one of which is that the bulge luminosity does not evolve as much as simple stellar synthesis models would predict , thus allowing the bulge and  to do so in near lock - step upwards .",
    "we have shown , using a set of conservative assumptions about the stellar population of the host , that the stellar bulge mass , , at a given , is probably lower in the past than today : if there is luminosity evolution , but no  evolution , then the /  ratio is larger at @xmath23 by almost the same factor that the galaxy dims due to passive evolution . because fading ( passive or otherwise ) would cause the host galaxies at @xmath34 to significantly over - shoot the @xmath111 relation , there has to be a build up in  stellar mass towards @xmath9 , whether by star formation or by mergers ( without increasing  in the same proportion ) .",
    "this was previously suggested by rix et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) and ridgway et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    as bhs",
    "only increase in mass , figure 1_a _ puts a strong constraint on how much the host galaxies can fade to arrive at the local -  relation by @xmath9 , regardless of their stellar population content at @xmath0 .",
    "luminous host galaxies ( @xmath154 mag ) with luminous quasars can not fade to become @xmath8 galaxies today , unless the mass estimators calibrated locally systematically and significantly overestimate  at high @xmath2 .",
    "while this study supplies more questions than answers regarding the nature of galaxy - bh evolution , we show that the -  diagram provides very useful constraints on the evolutionary paths of galaxies .",
    "thus , it may be worthwhile to extend this diagnostic by establishing locally the empirical relationship between  and bulge luminosity in multiple filters , since galaxies of different morphological types are expected to trace distinct paths in this space . in this parameter space of  vs. multi - color bulge luminosity diagram the locus of points for high-@xmath2 galaxies can be used to predict the directions in which galaxies evolve .",
    "galaxies in this diagram are not allowed to arbitrarily roam in color and luminosity because their evolutionary paths must ultimately take them to the local -bulge luminosity relationship . to understand",
    "how exactly galaxies traverse the phase diagram , it would be useful to obtain deep imaging of the environments of high-@xmath2 host galaxies in order to constrain their merger rates .",
    "thus far , we have not discussed how the presence of dust may affect our conclusions .",
    "sub - mm observations of @xmath5 quasars ( isaak et al .",
    "2002 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ; knudsen , van  der  werf , & jaffe 2003 ) indicate that at least some host galaxies appear to be highly star forming and hence presumably highly obscured .",
    "if this were generically true of all high-@xmath2 hosts , what we observe in the rest - frame @xmath38-band might be the dim light that filtered through a dense screen .",
    "in later phases , star formation may use up gas and dust , while supernovae explosions may blow holes in the ism , causing host galaxies to become more transparent with time . if this were to happen , the net effect of the fading populations and the decreasing optical depth on the absolute luminosity of the host galaxies is not clear .",
    "it is conceivable that the host does not evolve much in optical luminosity , if the galaxy dust extinction dropped at the same rate as fading of the stars .",
    "the monkey - wrench thrown into the interpretation by the presumption of dust is yet another reason why it would be worthwhile to establish a multi - color vs.  `` phase '' diagram , especially towards the rest - frame infrared . however , despite the possibility of dust , its presence must somehow conspire with star formation to preserve the good correlation seen at high-@xmath2 ( figure 1 ) , over 4 magnitudes in host luminosity .",
    "this suggests that either the distribution of dust is regular across galaxy - types , or that dust obscuration is not too significant in a number of galaxies by @xmath34 .",
    "in computing the @xmath41-correction , we assumed an sed appropriate for a _ current - day _ e / s0 galaxy , but galaxies at @xmath34 are most likely to be bluer .",
    "therefore the hosts are probably fainter in the rest - frame @xmath3-band than what we computed , and the -  relationship for @xmath49 hosts would be even more indistinguishable from @xmath111 normal galaxies .",
    "this conclusion relies heavily on the assumption that the techniques used to estimate  at low @xmath2 do not systematically and significantly overestimate  at high @xmath2 .",
    "currently , all  measurements are tied to locally calibrated values .",
    "it remains unproven that the agn broad - line regions at high @xmath2 have similar structure at low @xmath2 . because understanding the link between  and galaxy bulges is fundamentally important to a coherent knowledge of galaxy evolution in general , it is important to more fully understand how locally calibrated  measurement techniques apply to high @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , we prelude in the passing that a significantly larger sample of quasar host galaxies at @xmath155 from gravitational lensing has been analyzed to study the -  relationship .",
    "the results from that study further strengthen the conclusions presented here ( peng et al . in preparation ) .",
