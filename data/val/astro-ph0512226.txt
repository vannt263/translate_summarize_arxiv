    "the annual parallax is the most direct measurement of distances in astronomy .",
    "the hipparcos satellite successfully measured the distances to numerous stars in the solar neighborhood , typically achieving 10% accuracies for distances of @xmath5 pc , which contributed significantly to many fields of modern astronomy ( e.g. perryman et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , annual parallax measurements for stars with kpc distances require sub - milliarcsecond accuracy , which has not been achieved optically .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) provides the highest resolution in astronomy . in phase - referencing vlbi , the position of a target source",
    "is measured relative to a nearby positional reference source ( see e.g. beasley & conway 1995 ; ros 2003 ) .",
    "the feasibility of annual parallax measurements with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) has been demonstrated at low frequencies by brisken et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who measured annual parallaxes of pulsars in the galaxy and by van langevelde et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vlemmings et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who measured distances of galactic oh masers associated with late type stars .",
    "chatterjee et al . ( 2004 ) measured pulsar parallaxes at 5 ghz and showed that the accuracy of astrometric measurements improves with higher frequencies .",
    "their results indicate that one can measure distances of up to a few kpc with better than 10% uncertainty with vlba astrometry of maser sources .",
    "indeed , kurayama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the vlba to measure the annual parallax of the mira - type star ux cygni with high accuracy .",
    "hence , vlba measurements allow sources spread over a large part of the milky way to have accurate parallaxes .",
    "this enables us to probe galactic structure and dynamics since maser sources are spread over the whole galaxy and , especially water vapor ( h@xmath6o ) maser sources are even found in its outer reaches ( e.g. wouterloot et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the 22.2 ghz transition of h@xmath6o is the most widespread and luminous known maser line . in our galaxy",
    "it has been detected toward numerous evolved red giant stars and high- and low - mass star - forming regions ( see , e.g. , valdettaro et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "w3(oh ) is a region containing several high- and intermediate - mass young stars and proto - stars of different evolutionary stages ( e.g. wilner et al . 1999 ; wyrowski et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "in addition to strong oh and ch@xmath2oh masers , which are seen projected on the archetypical ultracompact ( uc ) region , very strong h@xmath6o maser emission is found toward the turner - welch ( tw ) object ( turner &  welch 1984 ; reid et al .",
    "1995 ; wilner et al .",
    "1999 ) , a protostar projected @xmath7 au east of the uc region .",
    "the w3(oh ) h@xmath6o masers were amongst the first studied with vlbi ( moran et al .",
    "vlbi maps of the h@xmath6o maser emission have been reported by alcolea et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "we observed w3(oh ) to measure its annual parallax and to study the internal dynamics of the known bipolar h@xmath6o outflow from the tw object .",
    "moreover , our observations constitute a trial parallax and proper motion observation to explore the potential of utilizing h@xmath6o masers as probes of galactic structure . here",
    "we report vlba observations of the w3(oh ) h@xmath6o masers which yielded an extremely accurate parallax .",
    "we observed the w3(oh ) h@xmath0o masers seven times with the nrao vlba between january 2001 and may 2002 ( see table  [ obs ] ) .",
    "each observation was carried out over a 4-hour period including calibrator observations .",
    "the separations between the epochs were between two and four months .",
    "we observed two 16-mhz bands with one band centered on the maser velocity .",
    "the data were correlated with 1024 spectral channels in each band with an integration time of 2 seconds .",
    "the resulting velocity channel spacing was 0.224 km s@xmath4 , and we covered a velocity range of 229 km s@xmath4 .",
    ".summary of the vlba observations .",
    "[ obs ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the tangential motion of the reference feature relative to the extragalactic background source icrf 0244 + 624 obtained from the parallax / proper motion fit is @xmath8 km  s@xmath4 eastward and @xmath9 km  s@xmath4 northward , for a distance of 2.04 kpc .",
    "adding the tangential motion of the center of expansion relative to these values gives the tangential motion of the center of expansion : @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 eastward and @xmath11 km  s@xmath4 northward .",
    "the second error of 0.4 km  s@xmath4 comes from the systematics discussed in sect .",
    "3.1 . while this systematic error dominates the error in the parallax measurement , the fitting uncertainty of the outflow model dominated the total error in the proper motion of the center of expansion .",
    "on the other hand , similar astrometric phase - referencing vlba observations have been carried out for 12.2 ghz methanol masers associated with the uc region in w3(oh ) ( xu et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these authors have estimated the proper motion of these methanol masers with respect to extragalactic continuum sources , and obtained a tangential motion of @xmath12 km  s@xmath4 and @xmath13 km  s@xmath4 , eastward and northward respectively .",
    "they have not estimated the internal motions of the methanol masers .",
    "however these are approximately 2 km  s@xmath4 ( moscadelli et al .",
    "2002 ) , much smaller than the internal h@xmath0o maser velocities .",
    "thus we assign a total uncertainty of 2 km  s@xmath4 to the absolute tangential motion of the methanol masers .",
    "combining the two vlba results , the center of expansion of the h@xmath0o masers ( presumably the tw object ) moves at @xmath14 km  s@xmath4 eastward , @xmath15 km  s@xmath4 northward and @xmath16 km  s@xmath4 in radial direction , with respect to the uc region of w3(oh ) .",
    "we used a systemic radial velocity of 51 km  s@xmath4 for the h@xmath0o masers ( tw object ) and 44 km  s@xmath4 for the uc region in w3(oh ) . converting this relative motion to a galactic cartesian coordinate system",
    ", the tw object relative to the uc region moves toward the galactic center with a velocity of @xmath17 km  s@xmath4 , in the direction opposed to galactic rotation with @xmath18 km  s@xmath4 , and toward the north galactic pole with @xmath19 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "in the case of w3(oh ) , a total ( 3-dimensional ) motion of the tw object with respect to the uc region is @xmath20 km  s@xmath4 ( 7 km  s@xmath4 in radial velocity plus 7 @xmath1 10 km  s@xmath4 tangential motion ) .",
    "what causes this large relative motion ? assuming that the tw object and the uc region are gravitationally bound , a total mass ( @xmath21 ) of the w3(oh ) region can be estimated by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a separation of w3(oh)-tw and uc region and @xmath24 is the relative motion .",
    "since the separation along the line of sight is still unknown , a separation of @xmath25 au is a minimum value .",
    "this total mass is much higher than any reasonable estimate for the combined mass of the stars in w3(oh)-tw the uc region , for which we estimate 17 and 23 m@xmath26 , respectively , since the spectral type of the tw object is approximately b0 ( wyrowski et al 1999 ) and that of the uc is approximately o8.5 region ( harten 1976 ) .",
    "so , these objects do not appear to be gravitationally bound .",
    "the only other massive stars with similarly measured 3-dimensional motions are the becklin - neugebauer object and radio source - i ( related to irc 2 ) in the orion kleinmann - low region .",
    "the relative motion of these objects is very large , @xmath27 km  s@xmath4 ( rodriguez et al . 2005 ) , and tan ( 2004 ) invokes ejection of the becklin - neugebauer object from the core of the orion nebula trapezium cluster to explain this .",
    "however , for the w3(oh ) sources , given their present - day relative motions , a close encounter of tw and the uc region can not have happened . perhaps , one or the other ( or both ) had an encounter with a third object in the recent past and are now unbound .",
    "the accuracy of the present h@xmath0o maser parallax measurements achieved with phase - referencing vlbi is @xmath28 10 @xmath29as .",
    "however , the high time variability of h@xmath0o masers limits such measurements in significant ways . while , we detected over 40 maser features at any epoch , and were able to trace 20 features over at least 5 epochs , only 2 of these 20 maser features had measurements that yield a reliable parallax measurement .",
    "in typical sources , few features might persist over a period of @xmath30  yr , which is optimum for annual parallax measurements .",
    "if one wishes to use the parallax and proper motion results to study galactic structure and kinematics , one needs to model the internal motions of the masers . to obtain an accurate model fit of the internal motions one needs to measure the motions of many maser features .",
    "poor estimation of the internal motion ( typical motions are 20 to 200 km s@xmath4 ) leads to inaccurate estimates of the 3-dimensional motion .",
    "of the many hundreds of known h@xmath0o maser sources in the milky way , most will not have as many detectable components as w3(oh ) .",
    "thus it may be difficult to study galactic dynamics using only h@xmath0o masers .",
    "due to strong variability and large internal velocities , h@xmath6o maser sources are not the best candidates to study the galactic structure and dynamics .",
    "other maser sources that show less variability and slower internal motions ( e.g. methanol maser xu et al . 2005 ) are preferable . on the other hand , h@xmath0o masers",
    "are much more common and also found in galactic regions where no methanol masers are found . some h@xmath0o masers are found in the outer galaxy near the edge of the optical stellar disk ( e.g. wouterloot et al . 1988 ) , while methanol masers ( e.g. pestalozzi et al .",
    "2005 ) have not been found there .",
    "therefore , these h@xmath0o masers can be the best sources to measure distances and motions in the outer galaxy .",
    "we have measured the annual parallax of the h@xmath0o maser source in the w3(oh ) region with phase - referenced vlba observations .",
    "the distance of 2.04 @xmath1 0.07 kpc that we obtain is consistent with previous photometric distance estimates ( but with much higher accuracy ) and with the ch@xmath2oh maser parallax corresponding to 1.95 @xmath1 0.04 kpc determined by xu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the related paper .",
    "we also measured the proper motions of the w3(oh)-tw h@xmath0o masers and find that the tw object is moving with a speed of @xmath3 7 km s@xmath4 with respect to the nearby uc region ( with its oh and ch@xmath2oh masers ) .",
    "such a large speed difference between two massive objects in the same star forming region is puzzling .",
    "although h@xmath6o masers are not perfect target sources to investigate galactic structure and dynamics , they can still provide important information about regions in the galaxy that are not accessible otherwise ( e.g. the outer galaxy ) .",

    "kh also would like to thank j. m. marcaide and j. c. guirado in the university of valncia and e. ros in mpifr for advice in phase - referencing vlbi astrometry .",
    "we would like to thank f. wyrowski in mpifr who gave useful comments on the tw object .",
