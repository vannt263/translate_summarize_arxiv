    "during the last decade , a large body of work has been devoted to the study of the kinetics of diffusion - annihilation processes .",
    "it is now well established that , below some upper critical dimension , the fluctuations play a central role and that accordingly mean - field like approximations are inappropriate .",
    "moreover , for the two species case @xmath0 , when the two reactants are initially spatially separated , a reaction - diffusion front , getting larger with time , is formed  @xcite . in the long time regime , the time dependent properties of this front ( position , width ) are characterized by power laws which are non - mean - field at or below two dimensions .    instead of investigating a time dependent problem , it was shown by cornell and droz  @xcite that it may be advantageous to study the front formed in the steady state reached by imposing antiparallel currents @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a- and b - particles at @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "it turns out that first , exact prediction can be made in the one dimensional case and second this stationary problem is closely related to the time - dependent one .",
    "more recently , a different but related problem has been considered , namely the case of ballistically - controlled annihilation processes .",
    "most of the results obtained are for the one dimensional case .",
    "initially , the particles are randomly distributed in space and their velocities are distributed according to a given distribution .",
    "the particles move freely and when two of them collide they instantaneously annihilate each other and disappear out of the system  @xcite . in 1985 ,",
    "elskens and frisch  @xcite considered the case of one species of particles moving with velocities @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the case of an arbitrary discrete velocity distribution has been studied by droz , rey , frachebourg and piasecki  @xcite and exactly solved for a symmetric three velocities distribution , using an exact closure of the hierarchy obtained previously by piasecki  @xcite .",
    "such processes can model several physical situations as a recombination reaction in the gas phase or the fluorescence of laser excited gas atoms with quenching on contact ( the one - dimensional aspect can be obtained by working in a suitable porous media  @xcite ) or , the annihilation of kink - antikink pairs in solid state physics  @xcite .",
    "we have recently investigated the case of the front formation for ballistic annihilation with two species initially separated in space in one - dimension  @xcite .",
    "this process can model , for example , the situation in which chemical species incorporated in a gel move ballistically under the action of a drift  @xcite .",
    "as the two species can not penetrate one into the other ( as they annihilate on contact ) , a well defined reaction front is formed . for a symmetrical poissonian - type initial spatial distribution ,",
    "we have proved  @xcite that the front behaves like a random walker for long time . in other words , at long time , the front can be anywhere on the line : it is delocalized .    in view of what has been done for the diffusive case ,",
    "it is natural to try to find a system with ballistic - annihilation possessing a localized reaction front .",
    "let us first remark that in the ballistic case , to impose a flux of particles at the boundaries of a finite system is equivalent to fix an initial spatial distribution of a large system . for example , the case with homogeneous spatial poisson distribution can be mapped onto a system with boundary fluxes of particles at constant rate , the time between two particles input being exponentially distributed .",
    "thus we shall consider the problem in terms of initial distribution of particles and ask the question : is it possible to localize the front by choosing a suitable initial distribution of the particles ?",
    "the answer is obviously yes . indeed , as a simple example , consider the case in which initially each particle is located on a regular lattice , the @xmath7 particles being to the left of the origin and the @xmath8 s to the right , in a symmetric way .",
    "the position at which collision between one @xmath7 and one @xmath8 particle takes place defines the position of the annihilation front .",
    "thus the front will always sit at the origin .",
    "however , this case is pathological in the sense that the initial state is totaly ordered . for more general situations , with spatial randomness in the initial state",
    ", we have first to define what is meant by  localisation of the front ",
    ". then we shall show that indeed , it is possible to find suitable initial conditions localizing the front .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we define precisely the class of models studied and introduce several criterions of localisation . in section 3 , we consider a class of correlated initial conditions for which we are able to compute the probability density @xmath9 to find the front at position @xmath10 at time @xmath11 and which leads to the localization of the front . in section four ,",
    "we consider a different class of initial conditions with no correlations between the initial positions of particles .",
    "for this more physical class of initial conditions , we are not able to compute explicitly @xmath9 , but we can show that the mean square position of the front @xmath12 converges for @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the probability density @xmath9 does not spread out .",
    "remarks and conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system formed of two species of particles .",
    "initially , particles @xmath7 are spatially randomly distributed in the region @xmath14 and the @xmath8 ones are spatially randomly distributed in the region @xmath15 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall consider only symmetric distributions in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number densities of particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . for nonsymmetric distributions , the front moves acquiring some mean velocity .",
    "the velocity of each particle is an independent random variable taking the value @xmath19 with equal probability .",
    "particles of the same kind suffer elastic collisions .",
    "when two particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 meet , they annihilate .",
    "thus , practically the @xmath7 particles with velocity @xmath6 and the @xmath8 particles with velocity @xmath5 move freely . accordingly , the relevant part of the dynamics concerns only the @xmath7 particles with velocity @xmath5 and the @xmath8 ones with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the initial positions of the @xmath7 particles with velocity @xmath5 and @xmath21 the initial positions of the @xmath8 s with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "the particles are labeled such that @xmath22 . the relative velocity between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles being @xmath23",
    ", the pair of particles initially at @xmath24 will collide at time @xmath25 .",
    "the position at which this collision will take place defines the position of the annihilation front .",
    "thus , the position of the front at time @xmath11 is @xmath26 , if @xmath27 ( i.e. if no particle has yet collided ) , @xmath28 , if @xmath29 ( i.e. only the first particles on the right and on the left have collided ) , and so on .",
    "the dynamics in itself is purely deterministic , the only stochastic aspect comes from the initial conditions .",
    "the properties of the front are completely defined by the probability density @xmath9 to find the front at the point @xmath10 , at time @xmath11 . in a previous paper  @xcite",

    "it follows that , the second moment of @xmath9 is @xmath33 \\theta \\left ( 2ct-[x_k - y_k ] \\right )      \\right\\rangle\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : secmom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    several criterions can be introduced to define the localization of the front .",
    "the first is simply to ask that @xmath9 approches for @xmath34 a limiting distribution with finite moments .",
    "a second criterion consists in asking that @xmath9 has a compact support with respect to @xmath10 , for all time .",
    "these two criterions are useful provided that one is able to compute @xmath9 .",
    "this calculation will be possible for our first class of initial conditions ( section 3 ) .",
    "however to deal with the second class of initial conditions , we are led to propose a weaker definition of the localization .",
    "the front will be said to be localized if @xmath9 has a finite second moment ( or variance in case of a non - symmetric initial distribution ) for all time @xmath35 .",
    "we know what is happening in two limit cases . for a poisson distribution",
    "the front is not localized while for particles regularly distributed on a lattice the front is strongly localized .",
    "it is thus natural to consider an initial distribution which extarpolates smoothly between these two limits .",
    "such distribution is provided by the erlang - k - process  @xcite . for @xmath36 ,",
    "one recovers the poisson process while for @xmath37 one finds the case of the regular distribution .",
    "however , it can be shown  @xcite that for all finite values of @xmath38 the front is delocalized .",
    "only the limit case @xmath37 is localized .",
    "we aim at finding a class of initial conditions for which the probability density @xmath9 has a compact support , with respect to x. this property can be obtained with the following initial condition : each @xmath8 particle is uniformly distributed in an interval of length @xmath39 , centered at @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the distance ( center - to - center ) between two consecutive intervals and @xmath38 labels the particles @xmath42 .",
    "we use the same distribution for particles @xmath7 , but on the left of the origin .",
    "first , remark that the position of any particle is completely independent of the other ; in addition we choose identical distribution for each particles , but at different regularly spaced positions .",
    "we eventually conclude that @xmath9 must be a time periodic function of period @xmath43 .",

    "we shall not reproduce these terms here as they are a little bit cumbersome .",
    "nonetheless , we plotted both @xmath9 and @xmath52 for @xmath44 ( see figure  [ fig : one ] and  [ fig : two ] ) .",
    "the plot of @xmath52 shows that it is not a simple function : already at this stage , @xmath9 has a non - trivial shape .",
    "it is clear that if we take an arbitrary distribution instead of a uniform one for the probability density inside each interval , we should always find that the support of @xmath9 is @xmath54 $ ] , although the detailed shape of @xmath9 may vary considerably .",
    "moreover , one can easily generalize all these statements to non - symmetric distributions , by taking into account that the front will move",
    ". the support of @xmath55 will not be the same for all time , as it will follow the mean position of the front .",
    "in this section we show that the front can be localized by a generalized poisson - type distribution . for a homogeneous symmetric poissonian particle distribution , we found  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the initial density .",
    "now suppose that instead of having a constant @xmath57 , the density increases with position according to a power law : @xmath58 then , the front ( whose average position is the origin ) will see an increasing density in time",
    ". we can expect to obtain @xmath59 for @xmath60 , @xmath61 converges to a constant , leading to a localization of the front , whereas for @xmath62 , it diverges and the front is delocalized .",
    "the mechanism leading to the this result is clear : when we increase the density , the mean distance between two successive particles decreases and thus two consecutive collisions should happen relatively often . as a consequence ,",
    "as the time grows , the probability to find the front far from its mean value becomes smaller .",
    "we shall now make more precise this qualitative picture .    to begin we choose ,",
    "as indicated , the initial particle distribution to be an inhomogeneous poisson law . in other words , if there is a @xmath8 particle at position @xmath50 , the probability to find its right nearest neighbor at position @xmath63 is @xmath64 \\ , , \\label{eq : ipdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 should be understood as the initial particle density at point @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , we find again the homogeneous poisson law already studied .",
