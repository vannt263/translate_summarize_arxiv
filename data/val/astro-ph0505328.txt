    "mapping the stellar halo requires objects that are sufficiently luminous to observe at large distances , yet common enough to sample the halo densely . in @xcite , hereafter paper i , we introduced the century survey galactic halo project , a photometric and spectroscopic survey from which we selected blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars as probes of the milky way halo .",
    "bhb stars meet our criteria for tracer samples : they are intrinsically luminous and are quite numerous , with a number density in the halo that exceeds that of rr lyraes by roughly a factor of ten @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of bhb stars are typically around a0 , bluer than most competing stellar populations . as a result , candidate bhb stars in the halo are relatively easy to select by broadband colors alone .    in paper",

    "we investigate the mean galactic rotation , metallicity , and luminosity function of the halo bhb stars in the context of a complementary 175 deg@xmath0 spectroscopic survey .",

    "a handful of sdss stars satisfy the 2mass - selection in @xmath27 and @xmath10 but are rejected by @xmath34 .",
    "thus the lack of overlap between the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples is likely due to the extreme uncertainties in 2mass colors for the fainter 16th and 17th magnitude sdss stars ( see fig.[fig : photss ] ) .",
    "interestingly , errant g - type stars found in the sdss sample are cleanly identified by 2mass photometry as bright and red @xmath35 stars .",

    "the on - line documentation for the sdss data archive now describes a series of flags that can be used to avoid such saturated objects .    to understand our completeness for bhb stars requires a better understanding of the sdss saturation problem .",
    "we start by selecting all stars with a - type colors along the celestial equator in sdss data release 2 @xcite .",

    "spectroscopic observations were obtained with the fast spectrograph @xcite on the whipple 1.5 m tillinghast telescope .",

    "typical signal - to - noise ( @xmath42 ) ratios were 30/1 in the continuum for objects brighter than 16th magnitude , decreasing to @xmath42=15/1 for the 17th magnitude objects .",

    "we measure spectral types and radial velocities , and derive metallicities , effective temperatures , and surface gravities , from the spectra of the total sample of 284 objects .",
    "the major difficulty in using bhb stars as probes of galactic structure is the need to distinguish reliably between low surface - gravity bhb stars and higher surface - gravity a - type dwarfs and blue stragglers . although investigators once thought blue stragglers were a minor component of the halo population , recent studies @xcite demonstrate that a surprisingly large fraction of faint stars in the color range associated with bhb stars are indeed high - gravity stars , many of which are blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "our classification of bhb stars is identical to the approach described in paper i. in brief , we apply the techniques of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to identify low surface - gravity bhb stars .",

    "@xcite have recently published a `` stringent '' color selection for bhb stars . applying",
    "the stringent color cut to our full sdss - selected sample would yield 55 bhb stars selected from 81 candidates for a net selection efficiency of 68% , but a completeness of only 65% compared to the full sdss - selected sample .",
    "in paper i we identified a number of unusual objects , including white dwarfs , subdwarfs , and b - type stars , within our survey of blue stars in the halo .",
    "the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples , by comparison , contain a handful of b stars , but do not include any white dwarfs or subdwarfs .",
    "the lack of white dwarfs may be explained by the more restrictive color selection we used for the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples .",
    "moreover , the b - type stars in the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples are almost entirely late b8 and b9 stars .",
    "these late b - types are potentially all hot horizontal - branch stars , but are very difficult to classify because the horizontal branch crosses the main sequence at this location in the h - r diagram .    the earliest b - type star in our samples is , classified as b7 . as the earliest b - type star in our samples ,",
    "is the most likely object to be a true b star rather than a hot horizontal - branch star .",
    "assuming has solar metallicity , with @xmath43 @xcite and @xmath44 @xcite , we estimate that it is located 6 kpc below the galactic plane .",
    "this places among the class of stars known as `` run - away b - type '' stars .",
    "the star is located at @xmath45 , hence its + 73 km s@xmath2 radial velocity points predominantly in the negative @xmath46 direction perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "if its radial velocity is the majority of its full space motion , it takes 10@xmath47 years for to travel 6 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "a b7 star has @xmath84",
    "@xmath48 @xcite and a lifetime @xmath82@xmath49 yr @xcite .",
    "thus , a likely run - away b7 star , has a lifetime consistent with its travel time from the disk .",
    "to map the galactic halo requires knowing the intrinsic luminosities of bhb stars .",
    "bhb stars are standard candles with luminosities that depend on effective temperature ( color ) as well as metallicity .",
    "we begin by discussing the physical basis of the bhb luminosity dependence on color ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "we then present the observed distribution of metallicities derived from our spectra ( section 3.2 ) . using our colors and metallicities ,",
    "we compute intrinsic luminosities for our field bhb stars and investigate their spatial distribution ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "finally , we investigate the mean galactic rotation of our halo samples ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "bhb stars share a common physical origin .",
    "they are stars that have evolved off the red giant branch and are burning helium in their cores with a hydrogen burning shell .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of a bhb star depends on the core mass , the stellar mass , and the metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more massive bhb stars have larger hydrogen - rich envelopes and are cooler than less massive bhb stars .",
    "the variation of effective temperature with stellar mass yields a robust relation between optical luminosity and b - v color : bluer bhb stars are fainter than red bhb stars .",
    "@xcite , hereafter psb , provide an empirical bhb luminosity - color relation from a fit to fifteen globular cluster bhbs .",
    "[ fig : models ] shows the psb @xmath5-color relation as a solid line .",
    "the relation is normalized to [ fe / h]=@xmath50 using the @xmath5-metallicity relation described below .",
    "globular clusters exhibit a wide range of bhb morphologies , evident in the 0.25 mag scatter of the points in psb s fig .  5 . because the large scatter may result from the physics of globular clusters rather than from the physics of bhb stars , we next consider a theoretical @xmath5-color relation .",
    "the theoretical @xmath5-color relation provides a physical basis for the empirical psb relation .",
    "to construct a theoretical @xmath5-color relation , we use the horizontal branch evolutionary tracks from @xcite . for models with @xmath51 ( equivalent to [ fe / h]@xmath52 )",
    "we adopt the luminosity at time zero and derive colors and bolometric temperatures from published tables @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath5-color relation for @xmath51 is the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "the theoretical @xmath5-color relation is remarkably similar in shape to the empirical psb relation in the ( ) @xmath53 region covered by our bhb star samples .    as a consistency check ,",
    "we plot a third line in fig.[fig : models ] that is simply the bolometric correction for a star with constant luminosity .",
    "we use the bolometric corrections for main sequence stars from @xcite , and add 0.5 mag to match the bolometric correction to the empirical and theoretical @xmath5-color relations at the red end .",
    "interestingly , the shape of the @xcite bolometric corrections is similar to both the empirical and theoretical bhb @xmath5-color relations , except that the slope of the bolometric correction curve is too shallow at the blue end .",
    "we expect this systematic difference because blue bhb stars are intrinsically less luminous than red bhb stars ; we have assumed a constant luminosity star .",
    "bolometric corrections from @xcite and @xcite yield similar results , with a typical scatter of 0.1 - 0.2 mag .",
    "this toy model shows that the primary ingredient in the bhb @xmath5-color relation is the bolometric correction for bhb stars .",
    "thus the physics common to all bhb stars leads to a general bhb @xmath5-color relation , albeit with an intrinsic spread resulting from age and metallicity .",
    "the @xmath5-color relation depends on age because the luminosity and effective temperature of a bhb star evolve with time .",
    "the @xmath5-color relation has a well known dependence on metallicity , but @xcite argue for an additional spread in @xmath5 at a given metallicity due to bhb morphology .",
    "the morphology effect is strongest for a metal poor [ fe / h]@xmath54 bhb with blue morphology ( hb type index=+1 ) . according to @xcite , a metal poor ,",
    "blue bhb is actually @xmath80.1 mag brighter than the standard luminosity - metallicity relation predicts .",
    "we conclude that the bhb @xmath5-color relation has an _ intrinsic shape _ due to the physics of the horizontal branch , with an intrinsic spread of 0.1 - 0.2 mag . for purposes of discussion ,",
    "we use the empirical psb @xmath5-color relation to estimate bhb luminosities in the rest of this section .",
    "we measure metallicities for bhb stars as described in paper i. we use three different techniques : the line indices of @xcite , the equivalent width of ca ii k plus a chi - square comparison between metallic - line regions in synthetic and observed spectra @xcite , and an optimization method that fits the entire spectrum @xcite .",
    "the three techniques are in good agreement with 0.25 dex uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the final metallicity is the average of the three techniques ; we adopt @xmath550.25 dex as the error in the final metallicity .",
    "figure [ fig : fehbhb ] plots the observed distribution of metallicities we measure in the original century survey sample , the 2mass - selected sample , and the sdss - selected sample .",
    "the median [ fe / h ] of the bhb samples are indicated by the dashed lines in fig.[fig : fehbhb ] and range from [ fe / h]=@xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "our metallicity - measuring techniques are limited to the range @xmath58[fe / h]@xmath59 , and so peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : fehbhb ] at [ fe / h]=@xmath60 and 0 are likely stars with lower / higher metallicities piling up at the limits .",
    "we caution that the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fehbhb ] are the observed and not the intrinsic distributions : because bhb luminosities have a mild dependence on metallicity , stars of different [ fe / h ] are sampled from different volumes of space ( see below ) .",
    "however , it is clear that our bhb samples are predominantly metal - poor and therefore consistent with a halo population .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) two - sample test provides a simple way to evaluate whether the different bhb samples are drawn from a common parent distribution of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the k - s two - sample test works by sorting an observed quantity , such as metallicity , and then comparing the cumulative distributions of two different samples with one another .",
    "the likelihood is calculated for the null hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "we test the metallicity distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fehbhb ] in a pairwise fashion , and find likelihood values ranging from 14% to 60% .",
    "thus our bhb samples are consistent with the null hypothesis that the metallicity distributions come from the same ( halo ) population .",
    "we calculate luminosities for our field bhb stars using the @xmath61 relation from @xcite .",
    "this relation assumes the _ hipparcos_-derived zero point ,",
    "@xmath62 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath63 @xcite , a @xmath5-metallicity slope @xmath64 based on rr lyrae stars in the large magellanic cloud @xcite , and the psb cubic relation in ( ) @xmath65 to provide the temperature correction .",
    "although the psb @xmath5-color relation was derived for globular cluster bhb stars , the _ shape _ of the relation reflects the physics common to all bhb stars , as explained above . note that we do not measure ( ) @xmath65 directly . for the sdss sample ,",
    "we are able to make accurate estimates of ( ) @xmath65 from sdss colors . for the 2mass sample ,",
    "we use 2mass photometry and balmer line strengths to estimate ( ) @xmath65 as described in paper i. we refer to these ( ) @xmath65 estimates as @xmath66 . from the derived luminosities we compute distances .",
    "we expect the relative distances of our bhb stars have a precision of @xmath86% .        because the luminosity of a bhb star is dependent on metallicity ,",
    "the depths reached by our flux - limited samples are dependent on metallicity .",
    "[ fig : limfeh ] shows the distribution of [ fe / h ] for the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples as a function of @xmath46 , the distance above or below the galactic plane .",
    "the dotted lines represent the magnitude limits for a bhb star at the median galactic latitude @xmath67 and at the median color @xmath68 of our samples .",
    "metal - rich bhb stars are intrinsically fainter than metal - poor bhb stars . fig .",
    "[ fig : limfeh ] shows that we sample bhb stars with [ fe / h]@xmath69 to 82% the depth of bhb stars with [ fe / h]@xmath70 .",
    "the bhb luminosity dependence on color is stronger than the dependence on metallicity .",
    "thus there is a strong selection bias with stellar color . in fig .",
    "[ fig : limbv0 ] we plot the distribution of @xmath66 color for the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples as a function of @xmath46 .",

    "[ fig : limbv0 ] shows that we sample bhb stars with @xmath72 to only 64% of the depth that we detect bhb stars with @xmath73 .",
    "the intrinsically faintest bhb stars are the bluest bhb stars hooking down off the horizontal branch in an h - r diagram .",
    "these faint bhb stars are sampled in a smaller volume than the more luminous bhb stars in our samples .",
    "we now plot the spatial distribution of the original century survey , the 2mass - selected , and the sdss - selected bhb samples ( fig.[fig : rz ] ) .",
    "spatial distribution is traditionally displayed in a wedge plot for survey slices like ours .",
    "however , a wedge plot is inappropriate in the context of the galaxy , where a slice in celestial coordinates cuts across varying galactic latitudes .",
    "the density of halo and disk populations is a strong function of both @xmath74 , the distance along the galactic plane , and @xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus in fig.[fig : rz ] we plot the distribution of bhb stars as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , the observed distribution of bhb stars clearly depends on both @xmath74 and @xmath46 .",
    "the 2mass- and sdss - selected bhb candidates sample complementary ranges of distances , but the overlap is unfortunately minimal . the 2mass and sdss catalogs formally overlap between 15 and 15.5 magnitude .",
    "however , in this magnitude range , the 2mass bhb selection suffers from incompleteness due to large color errors and the sdss bhb selection likely suffers from incompleteness due to saturation problems .",
    "there is wide disagreement in the literature on whether the stellar halo rotates significantly .",
    "previous surveys have found evidence for ( 1 ) no halo rotation @xcite , ( 2 ) a small prograde rotation @xcite , and ( 3 ) retrograde rotation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all the measurements of retrograde rotation come from surveys of the north galactic pole . by comparison ,",
    "the measurements of no rotation come from surveys covering many directions in the sky .",
    "our bhb samples cover a wide range of galactic latitude and longitude , and so provide us with a `` fair '' sample of the halo .",
    "although high galactic latitude stars are not ideal for measuring the rotation of the stellar halo , the 2mass- and sdss - selected samples include a number of stars near @xmath75 that are sensitive to a systematic rotation of the halo .        figure [ fig : rotz ] shows the mean rotation velocity of the 2mass- and sdss - selected bhb stars as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "each bin includes @xmath825 bhb stars that are first corrected to the local standard of rest @xcite and then evaluated by the methodology of @xcite .",
    "we assume a solar rotation of 220 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we expect some contamination from the thick disk in the nearest bhb stars , and indeed there is a hint of prograde rotation in the @xmath76 kpc bin .",
    "the mean rotation velocities of the @xmath3 kpc stars are , however , consistent with no rotation .",
    "the rotation velocity of the combined sample of 2mass- and sdss - selected bhb stars is @xmath4 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the bhb stars is 108 km s@xmath2 , also consistent with a halo population .",
    "the bhb stars from the original century survey sample cover a similar range of @xmath46 .",
    "however , the century survey bhb stars are located towards the galactic anti - center @xmath77 and towards the north galactic pole @xmath78 .",
    "thus the century survey stars provide very little leverage on halo rotation .",
    "when we include the century survey stars in the mean rotation velocity calculation , we find they add @xmath79 km s@xmath2 of retrograde rotation to the bins . we conclude the mean rotation velocities remain fully consistent with no halo rotation within their errors .",
    "knowledge of the intrinsic distribution of luminosities of field bhb stars is important for interpreting maps of the galactic halo .",
    "knowledge of the luminosity function is also important for understanding the intrinsic properties of field bhb stars that cover a broad range of observed magnitude , color , and metallicity .",
    "the luminosity function describes the number of stars per unit volume in the luminosity interval @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "we describe the method we use to calculate the bhb luminosity function ( section 4.1 ) , and discuss the role of the @xmath5-color relation in our result ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "we compare the luminosity function we determine for our field bhb stars ( section 4.3 ) with luminosity functions derived from globular clusters with bhbs ( section 4.4 ) .",
    "we calculate the luminosity function of our field bhb stars using the non - parametric maximum - likelihood method of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite maximum - likelihood method is commonly used to calculate the luminosity function of galaxies in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "we now apply this method to our survey of bhb stars in the galactic halo .",
    "the method does not simply count the numbers of stars at different luminosities , but weights the contribution of each star by the relative volume in which it can be observed in a flux - limited sample . specifically",
    ", the probability of a star at distance @xmath82 falling into the luminosity range @xmath83 $ ] is equal to the luminosity function at @xmath80 divided by the number density of stars one expects to see in a flux - limited survey at distance @xmath82 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood method works by maximizing the sum of these probabilities and solving for the best - fitting luminosity function .",
    "the density terms drop out in the maximum - likelihood formalism with two notable consequences .",
    "first , the maximum - likelihood method is unbiased by systematic density variations .",
    "the maximum - likelihood method does not require knowledge of the halo density distribution @xmath84 ; it only requires that the luminosity function is independent of position in the sampled volume .",
    "secondly , the absolute normalization of the luminosity function is lost and requires a separate computation .",
    "because stellar density varies with position in the milky way and because our samples are too sparse to fit the density profile directly , we compute only the _ form _ of the luminosity function , and arbitrarily normalize the luminosity functions to unity .          the @xmath5-color relations ( fig .
