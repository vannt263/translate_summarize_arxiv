    "in recent years , researchers have studied the photon transmission and correlation in the one - dimensional waveguide coupling to a wide variety of quantum systems , including quantum dots @xcite , a cavity with an atom inside @xcite or kerr nonlinearity @xcite , single or multiple atoms holding two or multiple levels @xcite , and an optomechanical cavity @xcite .",
    "this is due to their strong potential in manipulating and controlling the photon - state transmission @xcite .",
    "plenty of significant experimental efforts have been done to realize these systems on chip in integrated structures @xcite . in these structures ,",
    "many interesting phenomena are observed , for example , electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , fano resonance @xcite , slow light behavior @xcite , multi - photon transmission@xcite , and so on @xcite . with these phenomena",
    ", researchers have designed optical switches @xcite , single photon transistors @xcite , photon memory @xcite , and band filters @xcite .",
    "they potentially accelerate the development of the optical quantum information processing .    in these previous works ,",
    "researchers generally adopted the on - site coupling model described by the dirac function to express the interaction between the 1d waveguide ( 1dw ) and side optical cavity ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "this model is valid when the transversal ( parallel to the 1dw ) scale @xmath0 of the soc is much narrower than the wavelength @xmath1 of the guided light , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) where @xmath2 . on the contrary",
    ", it might not be suitable for the case given in fig .",
    "1(b ) where the transversal scale of the soc is comparable with or larger than the wavelength of the guide light , namely , @xmath3 .",
    "this is owing to that the soc mode can not be assumed as the local one compared to the waveguide s .",
    "the cavity photon can tunnel into the waveguide not only through soc center region but also through its side places , as shown in fig .",
    "hence , the coupling between the 1dw and soc for the structure shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) could not be described by the local model , as well as the dirac function .",
    "instead , the coupling depending on the transversal coordinate should be used .     and",

    "a quantum field method is used to find the dependence of the interaction between the 1dw and soc on the transversal coordinate .",
    "we show that it is mainly determined by the soc mode , and that it can strongly influences the single - photon transmission and the hybridization state between the 1dw and soc modes . besides , we derive out an analytical expression for the single - photon transmission and a dispersion equation for the hybridization state . for convenience ,",
    "the coupling structure of the 1dw and soc is abbreviated as 1dw - soc hereafter .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first find the real - space hamiltonian for the structure 1dw - soc from the quantum field theory , and then derive the hybridization state between the 1dw and soc modes and the single - photon transmission formula .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii we discuss two coupling cases : zeroth - order ( gaussian ) coupling , and first - order coupling .",
    "the former is described by the gaussian function , and the second is described by the first derivative of the gaussian function . in sec .",
    "iv , a gold - based 1dw - soc structure is taken to simulate the nonlocal effects of the single - photon transmission .",
    "at last , a brief conclusion is summarized in sec .",
    "because the considered structure shown in fig .  1",
    ", strictly speaking , is two dimensional , we need to start from the two - dimensional optical structure to find its hamiltonian .",
    "please note that though our start point is the two - dimensional structure , the following developed theory is also valid for the three dimensional situations .",

    "the cavity is limited in both directions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and that the waveguide is limited only in direction @xmath12 .",

    "the fact that @xmath85 is negative in the gray region of fig .",
    "2(a ) indicates that there is no hybridization between the 1dw and soc when @xmath95 .",

    "2(a ) , the hs for the foc is much different from the zoc . for the foc , there exist two regions that do not support the hs , namely , the upper - left and lower - right corners of fig .  2(b ) where @xmath85 is negative . the touch point of these two regions locating at @xmath96 and @xmath97 , represents a solution of eq .",

    "this is proved by the contour lines shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) : all the @xmath84 contour curves cross the point of @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , we can roughly say that the hs energy is red and blue shifted for the foc when @xmath0 is shorter and longer than @xmath99 , respectively .    in all dark regions of figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , the coupling @xmath84 is larger than @xmath19 .",
    "the condition of @xmath100 is hard to be achieved in practical cases , because the limitation of the soc to the photon becomes weak when the coupling between the 1dw and soc is too strong .",
    "thus , we do not discuss them in the present work .     and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "in all panels , @xmath93,width=8 ]    in order to definitely show the influence of the nonlocal coupling to the single - photon transmission , we plot the single - photon transmission spectra in fig .  3 for the zoc .",
    "the curves in all panels are offsetted by a step being 0.5 for easy observation .",
    "the transmission dip position determined by the hs energy first shifts rightward and then leftward with increasing the soc width @xmath0 .",
    "this variation behavior of the transmission dip is consistent with the variation of the hs energy with the soc width @xmath0 given in fig .",
    "2(a ) , and can be enhanced by increasing the coupling @xmath84 , referred to figs .",
    "3(a - c ) .",
    "simultaneously , the transmission dip is broadened , that is , the dip full width at half depth ( fwhd ) becomes large with increasing @xmath84 .",
    "this is due to that @xmath75 ( measuring the coupling between the 1dw and soc modes ) is proportional to @xmath85 , referred to eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 24a ) .    from fig .",
    "3(c ) , one can further find that the transmission dip is not symmetric about the vertical axis .",
    "this is mainly determined by the dependence of @xmath75 on the wave vector @xmath60 .",
    "seen from eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 24a ) , @xmath75 decreases with increasing @xmath60 as well as the photon energy @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the photon transmission on the left side of the transmission dip is lower than the right one , referred to eq .",
    "@xmath102 . naturally , this is from the nonlocal coupling between the 1dw and soc . from eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 24a ) , we can find that the coupling @xmath75 takes the maximum value of @xmath103 when @xmath104 for the zoc .",
    "when @xmath60 is near @xmath25 , the maximum @xmath75 is about at @xmath105 . hence , @xmath75 decreases with increasing @xmath0 when @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , the transmission dip becomes shallower and shallower with increasing the soc width , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . when @xmath0 tends to zero , the zoc transits to the on - site coupling . in such a situation , the limit @xmath107 which implies that there exists the coupling between the 1dw and soc as well as the transmission dip even when @xmath0 tends to zero .",
    "it is also the reason why the strongly local coupling between the 1dw and soc exists and can be described by the dirac function .     and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "in all panels , @xmath93.,width=8 ]    the transmission spectra for the foc are shown in fig .",
    "the shift of the transmission dip with the soc width is consistent with the hs energy shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) : when @xmath108 , they both red shift ; oppositely , they both blue shift .",
    "for example , as @xmath109 , the hs energy obtained from eq .",
    "( 25b ) is @xmath110 and @xmath111 when @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively [ refer to fig .",
    "correspondingly , the position of the transmission minimum value in fig .",
    "4(b ) locates at @xmath110 and @xmath114 for the cases of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "increasing @xmath84 could enhance this kind of variation because @xmath76 is proportional to @xmath85 , as plotted in figs .",

    "similar with the zoc , the depth of the transmission dip in fig .",
    "4 becomes shallower and shallower with increasing the soc width when @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "this could be explained by a similar reason : @xmath75 for the foc also first increases and then decreases with increasing @xmath0 , and the transition value of @xmath0 equals to @xmath116 . near the point of @xmath117 , the transition value of @xmath0 is about @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the transmission dip becomes shallower with increasing @xmath0 when @xmath119 . when @xmath120 , the transmission spectra in fig .",
    "4(c ) display large difference from the zoc , referred to fig .",
    "this is due to the more complexity of the dependence of @xmath75 and @xmath76 on @xmath60 for the foc compared with the zoc . in the discussion on the zoc",
    ", we have stated that the coupling between the 1dw and soc exists even at the limit of @xmath121 .",
    "for the foc , it is fully different .",
    "when @xmath121 , one can find @xmath122 for the foc . here the minus sign dates from the fact that the hs is red shift compared with the soc mode when @xmath0 is small , referred to fig .",

    "simultaneously , this behavior of the fwhd could be enhanced by increasing @xmath84 .",
    "they are , respectively , due to the facts that @xmath75 holds maximum for @xmath0 and that @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath85 for both coupling functions .    for describing the asymmetry of the transmission dip , we introduce two parameters : the dip left half width at half depth , @xmath125 , and the dip right half width at half depth , @xmath124 . for the symmetric transmission dip , they are equal to each other",
    ". the ratios of @xmath125 to @xmath124 are plotted in figs .",
    "5(c ) and 5(d ) for the zoc and foc , respectively .",
    "for the zoc , @xmath125 is always larger than @xmath124 , because @xmath75 always decreases with increasing @xmath60 no matter what value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is different from the foc whose @xmath75 increases with increasing @xmath60 when @xmath0 is small .",
    "thus , @xmath125 is smaller than @xmath124 for the foc when @xmath0 is small , as shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , it is the same with the zoc that @xmath75 decreases with increasing @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , the dip asymmetry is much more apparent for the foc than for the zoc , which should be attributed to that the foc holds stronger delocalization than the zoc .",
    "increasing @xmath84 also enhances the transmission - dip asymmetry .",
    "compared with the symmetric transmission spectra for the on - site coupling , the asymmetry of the transmission spectra here is fully from the nonlocal coupling between the 1dw and soc .",

    "the soc mode along the short - side direction is an even mode , while the soc mode along the long - side direction is an odd mode .",
    "this can be clearly seen from figs .",
    "6(c ) and 6(d ) which show the magnetic field distribution of the the electromagnetic wave with the vacuum wavelength @xmath132 being 1.536 @xmath133 m .",
    "consequently , the coupling between the 1dw and soc can be approximated by the zoc and foc for the structures shown in figs .",

    ", one can read the wavelength of the 1dw mode @xmath1 is about 1.3 @xmath133 m .",
    "thus , @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the vertical and horizonal arrangements , respectively . they imply that the nonlocal coupling effects could be observed for both arrangements .",
    "in addition , we should point out that the above approximation is not rather strict , though it can be done according to the distribution of the soc mode .",
    "this is due to that the magnetic field in the cavity is almost uniform along the short - side direction and is more nonlocal along the long - side direction than the foc .",
    "hence , the transversal effective sizes are a little longer than @xmath136 and @xmath137 for the vertical and horizonal arrangements , respectively .    in figs .",

    "the interaction between the 1dw and soc decreases with increasing @xmath126 .",
    "both figures 6(e ) and 6(f ) show that the transmission dip shifts rightward ( redshift ) with decreasing @xmath126 .",
    "such phenomenon is not consistent with our discussion on the zoc and foc examples shown in last section .",
    "this conflict is due to that the soc eigenfrequency also red shifts with decreasing @xmath126 : the limitation of the soc on the photon becomes weaker and weaker with decreasing @xmath126 .",
    "it can strongly shield the blue shift of the transmission dip due to the nonlocal coupling .",
    "however , the shift of the soc eigenfrequency does not strongly influence the line shape , including the fwhd and asymmetry of the transmission dip .",

    "6(g ) and 6(h ) the fwhd and right or left half width at half depth are defined through the wavelength instead of the frequency .",
    "figure 6(g ) shows that the fwhd decreases with increasing @xmath126 for both the vertical and horizonal arrangements which are consistent with the zoc and foc situations .",

    "6(g ) . together with the parameter relations of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , from figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) we could estimate that the coupling between the 1dw and soc is about one tenth of the soc eigenfrequency when @xmath140 m for the structures shown in figs .",
    "6(a - b ) . from figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , we can further find that the ratio of the foc s fwhd with @xmath141 to the zoc s with @xmath142 is about 1.3 when @xmath143 .",
    "this ratio also can be obtained from fig .",
    "6(g ) , and is about 1.4 when @xmath140 m .",
    "they are qualitatively consistent with each other .",
    "in addition , the ratios of @xmath144 plotted in fig .",

    "these simulation results confirm that the nonlocal coupling effects can really appear in the coupled structure of the 1dw and soc .",
    "in the present work , we studied the effects of the nonlocal coupling between the one - dimensional waveguide and the side optical cavity .",
    "the real - space hamiltonian with nonlocal coupling terms was derived in the quantum field view . from the hamiltonian",
    ", we found an analytical formula for the single - photon transmission .",
    "simultaneously , an equation was derived to determine the nontrivial state  the hybridization state between the one - dimensional waveguide mode and the side optical cavity mode .",
    "two examples of nonlocal coupling , namely , the zeroth- and first - order couplings , were adopted to show the effects due to the nonlocal coupling . from them , we got that the hybridization state is blue shift for the zeroth - order coupling compared with the side cavity mode , while the hybridization mode is red shift when the transversal cavity scale is short .",
    "the nonlocal coupling also induce the asymmetry of the single - photon transmission dip . at last , we simulated this nonlocal coupling effects by the gold - based one - dimensional waveguide .",
    "their transmission behaviors are consistent with the conclusions of the zeroth- and first - order couplings",
