    "anomalous diffusion processes occur in many physical systems for various reasons including disorder in terms of energy or space or both @xcite .",
    "the anomalous diffusion processes are expressed as @xmath0 for the displacement @xmath1 ; the process is called sub - diffusive or dispersive if @xmath2 while it is called super - diffusive if @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one of the useful theories for such processes is the continuous time random walk where the non - poissonian waiting time distribution of jump motion is introduced @xcite . for",
    "sub - diffusion processes the fractional diffusion equation has been derived from the continuous time random walk model with the power - law waiting time distribution function @xcite .",
    "the theory is continuous in space and thus is very useful to introduce the effect of interactions and the boundary conditions .",
    "the fractional diffusion equation is valuable for describing reactions in the dispersive transport media @xcite . in the theory of diffusion - controlled reactions",
    "the boundary conditions describing reactions are very important . for the perfectly absorbing boundary conditions",
    "the generalization of the smoluchowski theory based on the ordinary diffusion equation to the fractional diffusion equation is straightforward . on the other hand , for the partially reflecting boundary conditions the exit from the encounter distance",
    "interferes with the reaction at the encounter distance , therefore the latter is influenced by the non - exponential waiting time distribution function .",
    "thus , the generalization of the conventional partially reflecting boundary conditions associated with the ordinary diffusion equation to those associated with fractional diffusion equation is not obvious .",
    "recently , sung et al .",
    "phenomenologically introduced the fractional reaction - diffusion equation and found that the recombination probability of a particle starting from @xmath4 for the partially reflecting boundary condition is equal to that obtained for the perfectly absorbing boundary condition @xcite , and thus independent of the intrinsic reaction rate at the encounter distance .",
    "when the partially reflecting boundary condition is used , a fraction of particles that arrive at the encounter distance will recombine , while the others will escape the reaction .",
    "therefore , the recombination probability for the partially reflecting boundary conditions should be lower than that for the perfectly absorbing boundary condition .",
    "fractional reaction - diffusion equations or continuous time random walk models are also introduced for the description of nonlinear reactions , propagating fronts and two species reactions in sub - diffusive transport media @xcite .",
    "however , these fractional reaction - diffusion equations share the same structure as that used by sung et al . ; the reaction term does not have any delay effect and only the diffusion term has a memory effect . in this paper",
    "we derive a fractional reaction - diffusion equation from a continuous time random walk model ; it gives the proper partially reflecting boundary conditions applicable for the fractional diffusion equation .",
    "the reaction term as well as the diffusion term has a memory effect because the exit from the encounter distance , which is described by the algebraic waiting time distribution of jump motion interferes with the reaction at the encounter distance .",
    "our theory is different from the more macroscopic description of nonlinear reaction in sub - diffusive transport media @xcite , where the reaction is accounted for not by a space dependent sink term but by the law of mass action which is space independent .",
    "the recombination probability is obtained from the fractional reaction - diffusion equation thus derived .",
    "it is also shown by simulations that the recombination probability indeed depends on the intrinsic reaction rate .",
    "we consider geminate recombination of a b particle starting at @xmath5 with a. b particle migrates toward a by anomalously slow diffusion , @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "reaction takes place at the encounter distance of @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "after b particle leaves the encounter distance it performs random walk described by the sub - diffusion kinetics . when the migration dynamics is described by the ordinary diffusion equation , the reaction is accounted for by assuming that the flux of b into the region @xmath8 to @xmath10 is proportional to the density of b at @xmath8 and the resultant boundary condition is well established @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition is referred to as the partially reflecting or radiation boundary condition .",
    "it is also well known that imposing the boundary condition is equivalent to introducing the sink term in the diffusion equation ( reaction - diffusion equation ) with the perfectly reflecting boundary condition @xcite .",
    "however , if the motion of b particle is sub - diffusive , the corresponding boundary condition is not known , though the sub - diffusion motion itself is described by the fractional diffusion equation . on the other hand , in the lattice model",
    "the sub - diffusion motion is derived from the theory of continuous time random walk and reaction can be easily accounted for in this theory .",
    "we start from the lattice model and take the continuous limit in order to obtain the sink term for the fractional diffusion equation .",
    "the continuous time random walk is specified by the waiting time distribution , @xmath11 , of making a jump to a neighboring site at time @xmath12 in the absence of reaction . to be more specific",
    "a particular model is introduced where the algebraic asymptotic tails result from the distribution of the site energy @xcite .",

    "an argument that is sometimes used to justify their result is that for the sub - diffusive case the mean residence time at a site is infinitely long , therefore any particle in a reactive zone undergoes reaction however small the intrinsic reaction rate may be .",
    "we have shown here that even if the mean residence time is infinite , each particle at a site has a finite waiting time of jump motion and a fraction of particles in the reaction zone will escape reaction , if the intrinsic reaction rate is finite .",
