    "diffusion - limited reactions in low - dimensional geometries are well known to exhibit anomalous `` kinetics different from those predicted by the standard law of mass action [ ovchinnikov & zeldovich , 1978 ; toussaint & wilzcek , 1983 ; kang & redner , 1984 ; kopelman , 1988 ; burlatskii _ et al . _ ,",
    "an example of anomalous kinetics is exhibited by the diffusion - limited irreversible reaction @xmath0 . if the distribution of each reactant is spatially homogeneous , the rate laws for the global reactant densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a constant global rate coefficient . if @xmath6 then the densities of the two species are equal at all times , @xmath7 , and we can write @xmath8 . in integrated form @xmath9 ; at long times @xmath10 .",
    "we call this behavior classical . ''",
    "however , the actual asymptotic rate law in an infinite volume in dimensions @xmath11 for an initially random distribution of reactants is instead @xmath12 [ ovchinnikov & zeldovich , 1978 ; toussaint & wilzcek , 1983 ; kang & redner , 1984 ; kopelman , 1988 ; burlatskii _ et al . _ , 1989 ] .",
    "the associated asymptotic time dependence of the density is then @xmath13 ( with logarithmic corrections for @xmath14 ) .",
    "the physical origin of the anomalies \" is in general clearly understood .",
    "the usual law of mass action assumes a spatially homogeneous mixture of reactants ; however , in low dimensions diffusion is not an efficient mixing mechanism and may be incapable of smoothing out reactant concentration fluctuations that are created , for example , by nonhomogeneous initial conditions , by external reactant sources if the system is open , or by the reaction itself .",
    "consider the @xmath0 reaction starting from an initially random distribution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "such a distribution exhibits local density fluctuations , that is , certain regions of the system are relatively rich in species @xmath15 while others are relatively rich in species @xmath16 . by efficient \" mixing we mean mixing that is rapid relative to the local reaction rate .",
    "thus , if efficient mixing ( by whatever mechanism ) occurs , such local fluctuations are rapidly suppressed .",
    "if mixing is not efficient as , for example , in a diffusion - limited reaction in low dimensions , then the reaction will cause the local minority species to be eliminated extremely rapidly by the local majority species , and diffusion is not able to homogenize the system .",
    "there follows an evolution of regions in which essentially only one or the other of the species is present , and any attempt of the minority species to diffuse into this region leads to its rapid disappearance by reaction .",
    "the reaction then only takes place at the interfaces of aggregates of different species . as",
    "time proceeds ( and the concentrations of reactants decrease ) , the regions in space that are occupied by reactants of essentially only one species grow in size , and the total interface area at which the reaction can occur decreases .",
    "this leads to ever more effective spatial segregation of the species and an associated slowing down of the reaction relative to its rate in a homogeneous mixture .",
    "the system goes through a hierarchy of anomalous kinetic behaviors [ argyrakis _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ; lindenberg _ et al . _ , 1996 ] to arrive asymptotically at the so - called zeldovich regime [ ovchinnikov & zeldovich , 1978 ; burlatskii _ et al .",
    "_ , 1989 ] characterized by the time dependence @xmath17 for @xmath11 .",
    "this discussion punctuates three interesting features of these irreversible diffusion - limited reactions in constrained ( low dimensional ) geometries .",
    "one is that the initial distribution determines the evolution of the system for all time : the future of the reaction is imprinted in the spatial distribution at one given ( initial `` ) moment .",
    "a second is the fact that it is necessary to start with _ disorder _ in order to produce an _ ordered _ state at a later time : the formation of ever larger aggregates of a single species is a direct consequence of initial fluctuations that are not homogenized .",
    "a third is the realization that a random distribution is but one of many possible initial distributions , and it is certainly not the most easily realized in practice .",
    "the historical focus on the random distribution has perhaps obscured the fact that other initial distributions lead to other behaviors , some less anomalous '' and others even more anomalous \" than the zeldovich law @xmath17 in their deviation from classical kinetics .",
    "it is this last point that we focus on in this paper .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the suppression or enhancement of initial density fluctuations will affect the kinetic progression and change even the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 system .",
    "in particular , an initial distribution that is more homogeneous or mixed than a random one is expected to lead to behavior closer to classical ; conversely , an initial distribution in which fluctuations are more prominent is expected to lead to greater deviations from the law of mass action .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we base our analysis on the reaction - diffusion equations utilized in many theoretical studies of this problem .",
    "it is important to point out that our numerical results are also based on these _ same _ equations .",
    "this differs from the more usual , more microscopic , approach of simulating the system as a lattice gas in which the reactants are random walkers and in which the reaction is an annihilation that occurs with certainty or with some probability when reactants step on the same lattice site .",
    "simulations at this level of detail require large computer capabilities and long times to reach asymptotic behaviors [ argyrakis _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ; lindenberg _ et al . _ , 1994 , 1996 ] .",
    "reaction - diffusion equations represent mesoscopic approximations to this more microscopic picture ; such approximations can therefore only provide a theoretical backdrop over spatial and temporal ranges that are not too detailed and for densities that are not too low .",
    "the results of direct numerical solution of the reaction - diffusion equations are of course constrained in the same way as are the equations themselves . on the other hand ,",
    "such solutions , being more mesoscopic from the outset , require less computational intensity and length to cover the hierarchies of behaviors and to achieve asymptotic behaviors .",
    "although this approach of course provides no information on the limits of validity of reaction - diffusion models , they do provide a simpler and less costly backdrop against which to check the theoretical analysis of the model .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equations for the local densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the two species are :    @xmath25    the reaction takes place under stoichiometric conditions for the global densities ,    @xmath26    so that the densities of both species remain equal forever .",
    "@xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient , which we assume to be the same for both species , @xmath5 is the local reaction rate constant , and @xmath27 is the system volume . note that we are using the same symbol , @xmath5 , for the local rate coefficient as we did for the global rate coefficient .",
    "when the global rate law is classical , the two are in fact the same ; when it is not , the global rate is in any case not quadratic in the global density and the rate coefficient \" in a quadratic rate law is then not even a constant .",
    "we vary the values of the parameters in our analysis , but recognize that ( in appropriate dimensionless units ) a diffusion - limited reaction occurs if @xmath28  indeed , a strictly diffusion - limited reaction requires @xmath29 . with @xmath5 finite ( no matter how large ) , when the density is sufficiently low the reaction becomes reaction- rather than diffusion - limited    a few comments concerning notation are useful at this point .",
    "the local densities @xmath30 evolve from initial configurations @xmath31 . in some cases",
    "these initial configurations are chosen from a distribution of different configurations ( e.g. , a random distribution ) and it might be appropriate to perform an average over the initial distribution [ lindenberg _ et al . _ ,",
    "in other cases the initial configuration may be a very specific one , e.g. as in the study of the evolution of fronts [ koo & kopelman , 1991 ] .",
    "we denote an average of a quantity @xmath32 over the initial distribution by a bracket : @xmath33 .",
    "if we are dealing with a specific initial configuration then the initial distribution is a delta function and a quantity averaged over the initial distribution \" is simply the same as the unaveraged quantity , @xmath34 .",
    "global quantities such as the global density are related to local ones by the volume average indicated in eq .",
    "( [ global ] ) .",
    "we also use a single bracket notation to denote an average over volume .",
    "the use of a single bracket to denote one or the other or both averages should not create confusion since the context makes it clear what averages have been taken .",
    "in any case , a dependence only on the time indicates that a volume average has been performed , @xmath35 .",
    "the first impetus toward finding the global density from the reaction - diffusion equation might be to average eq .  ( [ difreac ] ) over initial distribution and volume",
    "so as to obtain an equation for the rate of change of the global density .",
    "however , this of course introduces a two - density average on the right hand side : @xmath36 where we have noted that @xmath37 since @xmath38 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "one might then write an equation for the two - density product and again perform an average , which introduces a three - density term .",
    "in many problems it is possible to truncate such a hierarchy and thereby close the set of equations .",
    "such closure is not possible here because it would miss the many - body nature of the problem : indeed , the evolution of macroscopic structures in these systems would seem to indicate that no finite body approximation \" is appropriate , and that one needs to capture at least some aspects of the many - body effects to all orders to obtain a reasonable approximation .",
    "we note that classical behavior is captured by eq .",
    "( [ integrated ] ) only if the average of the product can be broken into the product of the averages , @xmath40 .",
    "this separation is in general not correct and , in particular , not when there is species segregation . indeed ,",
    "if the species are strictly segregated then the right hand side is zero because it is not possible to find @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the same location , and thus the rate of change of the global densities vanishes , as it should .",
    "if there is _ some _ species overlap , then the decay rate does not vanish but is slow ( slower than classical ) .",
    "if the species are randomly or homogeneously distributed , then the average of the product does reduce to the product of the averages and the kinetics are classical , with a consequent inverse time decay of the global densities .",
    "a number of procedures have been introduced to deal with the many - body aspects of the problem [ vitukhnovsky _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ; burlatskii _ et al .",

    "if the system is thoroughly mixed , this variable is everywhere small ; if the species are segregated , then the variable is positive in regions where @xmath15 predominates and negative where @xmath16 predominates ; its variability contains information on the sizes of such regions .",

    "we shall call @xmath60 the segregation function , since the difference variable ( and consequently this function ) vanishes for a homogeneous distribution .    as we demonstrate explicitly below , the decay of @xmath60 with time ( through diffusion )",
    "is not simply of a fixed inverse power form over the entire history of the process .",
    "furthermore , in general there is no simple relation that holds for the entire progression of the reaction between the average of the square of the local density and the average density itself .",
    "consequently , there is no exact kinetic description of the system in terms of only the global density : indeed , eq .",
    "( [ averagesum ] ) is again but the first member of an infinite moment hierarchy . nevertheless , one attempts to extract a kinetic description from eq .",
    "( [ averagesum ] ) , at least approximately , recognizing that in any case a single kinetic description does not hold for all times .",
    "it has therefore become common practice to speak of kinetic behaviors that are valid over some substantial time range , and crossovers from one type of behavior to another .",
    "if the crossover `` regimes are short compared to the regimes where one type of behavior persists , one can then characterize the system in terms of a sequence of kinetic behaviors and transitions between these behaviors .",
    "such a description turns out to be possible in many cases . toward this purpose , in [ lindenberg _ et al .",

    "a general point that we return to subsequently in the context of particular cases can already be made here : the presence of the driver \" @xmath68 causes deviations from classical behavior ; as already mentioned , a homogeneous distribution of reactants at time @xmath69 is associated with a vanishing @xmath60 and with classical kinetics .",
    "the behavior of @xmath60 for _ all times _ and , in particular , how rapidly it vanishes at long times , is completely determined by the _ initial _",

    "the long - time behavior of the segregation function defined by the difference variable is dictated by the long - wavelength components of the initial distribution ( and also note that this behavior is entirely determined by diffusion and is not influenced by the reaction ) . in this paper",
