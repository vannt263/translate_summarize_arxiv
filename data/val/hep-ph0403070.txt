    "besides some recent anomalies at the two b factories , the standard kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) model of cp violation has been amazingly successful .",
    "flavor physics is at the center of the kobayashi - maskawa(km ) model , the standard model of cp violation .",
    "the origin of flavor mixing is a mismatch between the mass eigenstates and the weak gauge eigenstates .",
    "therefore , within the standard model , the origin of flavor is the yukawa couplings which give rise to all fermion masses . in km model ,",
    "the cp violation is mediated by the charged current processes that interfere with each other . with three generations , the charge current mixing matrix , the ckm matrix , has exactly one physical phase .",
    "indeed it was first observed by kobayashi and maskawa(km)@xcite that the two generation standard model can not support any cp violating phase .",
    "( actually ref.@xcite proposed many different additions to the standard model in order to incorporate cp violation , including the km model and higgs models ) .",
    "the fact that all three generations have to be involved to create a cp violating phenomena , makes km model extremely subtle and beautiful model for cp violation .",
    "it also makes cp violation tightly connected with flavor physics .",
    "this partly explains why the cp violation is small in the kaon system .",
    "it is because , at the energy scale of kaon , the heavy third generation almost decouples and , as a result , the effective cp violation is more superweak - like despite the fact the phase in the ckm matrix may not be small at all in some convention ( in particular , in wolfenstein@xcite or in chau - keung@xcite conventions ) .",
    "this difference in the quark masses is of course related to the hierarchy in the eigenvalues of the yukawa coupling matrices which are bare parameters in standard model .",
    "the situation of course changes in the @xmath1 meson system .",
    "the higher masses of @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) mesons open up many decay channels of different flavor property and make it a great laboratory to study flavor physics and the associated cp violating effect . as a result , there has been a large amount of literature studying the effect of cp violation in different @xmath1 decay channels and we shall not dwell into this .",
    "it suffices to say that km model predicts special pattern of cp violating effects in various @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) decay channels which can be contrasted with the patterns arisen from other cp violating mechanisms in the near future .",
    "it is also important to note that any theory that attempts to explain the origin of fermion mass hierarchy will automatically alter the picture of cp violation puts forth in km model for better or for worse .",
    "there are two often quoted weak points in the km mechanism .",
    "first , it has been shown that km model alone is insufficient to produce large enough baryon asymmetry in the cosmic evolution .",
    "the main difficulties are two folds .",
    "first of all , given the current limit of the higgs mass , the electroweak phase transition tends to be not strongly first order enough to provide the off - equilibrium condition necessary to generate baryon asymmetry .",
    "secondly , the cp violating source in ckm matrix tends to be too small to provide large effects .",
    "there are various attempts to extend km model to overcome the above difficulties and to generate the baryon asymmetry at electroweak scale .",
    "two leading proposals are ( 1 ) the minimal supersymmetric extension of standard model ( mssm ) , or ( 2 ) two higgs doublet extension .",
    "of course , the alternative is to give up electroweak baryogenesis and produce baryon or lepton asymmetry at higher energy scale .",
    "the second weakness of km mechanism is that it does not explain why strong cp @xmath0 is so small .",
    "there are two levels to this problem , the tree and the loop levels .",
    "since the cp violating phase in km model is a part of the yukawa couplings , which are dimension four couplings just like the tree level @xmath0 parameter , the @xmath0 should naturally be one of the bare parameters of the model with a natural value of order one .",
    "the phase convention independent , physical @xmath0 , which is a linear combination of three level @xmath3 and extra contribution from the quark mass matrices , @xmath4 , should also be naturally of order one .",
    "this is the tree level strong cp problem .",
    "the second issue is , even if the @xmath0 is tuned to zero at tree level , radiative corrections still make it too large or divergent .",
    "however , it should be noted that , by being tightly connected with the flavor physics as described above , the km mechanism has already embedded in itself a natural mechanism to suppress the loop correction to @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown that if one heuristically set the physical @xmath0 to zero at the tree level , nonzero loop correction will not occur till three loop level ( with two weak and one strong loops)@xcite , and logarithmic divergent correction to @xmath0 can appear only at the 14th order of the electroweak coupling @xmath5 ( or , at the 7-loop level)@xcite .",
    "even if one puts in the planck scale as the estimate of the cut - off , the divergent correction produces only a minute value for @xmath0 just like the 3-loop finite corrections .",
    "that is , the special @xmath6 point , while not natural , is actually quite robust under radiative corrections .",
    "this nice property is a direct consequence of the coupling between flavor physics and cp violation in the km model . in this sense ,",
    "the strong cp problem in km model is more of a tree level problem .",
    "all we need is to look for a mechanism beyond standard model to suppress the tree level @xmath0 parameter .",
    "in fact , this mechanism does not have to be a low energy mechanism .",
    "it can be some features embedded in a high energy theory such as gut or string theory .",
    "a popular class of model is the nelson - barr mechanism @xcite in which a ( softly broken or gauged ) flavor symmetry and spontaneously broken cp symmetry are used at high energy in a gut - like theory to suppress the tree level @xmath0 .",
    "the phase of the km model is generated by introducing additional heavy vectorial fermions which can have cp violating mixing with the ordinary fermions .    in models such as those of nelson - barr type ,",
    "one typically has an one loop induced @xmath0 at the higher energy scale .",
    "this is of course because the corresponding tight connection between cp violation and flavor physics is lost in the extension .",
    "( an exception can be found in ref.@xcite in which this tight connection is almost maintained ) .",
    "such contributions are typically not suppressed by the heavy scale and it is up to the adjustment of the model parameters to make such contributions small enough . while flavor symmetry was used in the examples provided by ref.@xcite , it can potentially be replaced by some other symmetry and therefore does not play an essential role .",
    "in addition , in this class of models , the strong cp @xmath0 parameter receives one loop contribution at high energy and still needs some fine - tuning to make it small .",
    "another recent example@xcite involving even more direct use of flavor symmetry , uses the abelian flavor and cp symmetry to make the up ( down ) quark mass matrix lower ( upper ) triangular with real diagonals .",
    "this will guarantee that tree level @xmath0 is zero while still have enough parameter to create km phase of any magnitude one wishes .",
    "no extra fermions are needed in this type of models .",
    "there are other classes of models that are typified in refs.@xcite .",
    "in particular , ref.@xcite uses an @xmath7 flavor symmetry which gives rise to the one - loop suppression of @xmath0 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a flavor sensitive discrete symmetry is used to reduces the contribution to @xmath0 to the two - loop level . in ref.@xcite , left - right gauge symmetry is employed to reduce the contribution to @xmath0 to the two - loop level .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a few models that can produce km model as a low energy effective theory but with naturally small @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of models to review here is of course a result of our own temporary preference",
    ". we will start with a review of the models of glashow , of masiero - yanagita with emphasis on the flavor aspect of the model .",
    "then , we shall present a new model based on an so(3 ) horizontal symmetry .",
    "we will show that in both @xmath8 and @xmath7 models , the @xmath0 can be reduced to two - loop level by using an additional discrete symmetry which can be broken softly or spontaneously . a more detailed exposition of this new class of models is contained in ref.@xcite .",
    "glashow invented a softly broken @xmath9 flavor symmetry to produce a triangular mass matrix for quarks at the tree level using three higgs doublets and soft cp breaking .",
    "the three higgs doublets , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , couple to the quarks in a way preserving an abelian flavor quantum number @xmath13 given by @xmath14 @xmath15 here the quark field is indexed by its generation .",
    "the symmetry turns the yukawa hamiltonian into the form : @xmath16 there are no higgs field with @xmath17 or @xmath18 , so the yukawa couplings are of the form : @xmath19 @xmath20 the cp symmetry is assumed to be only softly broken such that the yukawa couplings as well as the tree level @xmath0 coupling are both zero .",
    "the vev s of @xmath21 s produce the mass matrices for the down - type quarks and the up - type quarks in the form of    @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the zeroth order quark mass without the mixing effects",
    ". among the three vev s of the higgs bosons , @xmath28 is chosen to be real by convention .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 all have the same phase and , @xmath33 and @xmath34 have another . since both flavor and cp are assumed to be softly broken , one can use the flavor symmetry to remove another phase from the vev s .",
    "for example , one can make the phase of @xmath29 and @xmath30 vanish and be left with complex phase only in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that one special case is that the phase of @xmath33 is twice that of @xmath30 . in that case , using the flavor symmetry one can make all vev s real and cp violation disappears from the mass matrices ( even though there are still soft cp violation in the higgs mixing ) .    in the above choice of the @xmath13 quantum number",
    ", we made @xmath35 lower triangular and @xmath36 upper triangular .",
    "however , if we make another choice , @xmath37 we can have @xmath35 upper triangular but @xmath36 lower .",
    "both are phenomenologically feasible but we take the first choice for its simplicity . with this choice ,",
    "one then diagonalizes the mass matrix perturbatively and derives the mixing angles @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40 it is clear that the down - quark mass matrix provides the dominant contribution to the mixing angles , with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we can choose the convention that @xmath29 , @xmath30 are real , and only @xmath33 complex in the way consistent to the wolfenstein ( chau  keung ) parameterization .",
    "in this convention , the complex phase in the @xmath44 plane is the phase of @xmath33 , which can be of order one !",
    "one should also note that the flavor abelian group can be reduced from a continuous phase @xmath45 to discrete phase angles , @xmath46 , while achieving the same kind of triangular mass matrices .",
    "the above triangular structures are of course not preserved at the one loop level , and as a result , there will be one loop correction which was estimated@xcite to be @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is an one loop integral factor of order one or smaller .",
    "this can be about @xmath49 or smaller .",
    "now , if one takes the masses of the exotic ( beyond sm ) scalar bosons , as well as the scale of the dimensionful soft flavor breaking scalar couplings , to be around a high energy scale @xmath50 , the resulting one - loop @xmath0 depends on @xmath50 only logarithmically through @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , while these exotic scalar bosons can be as light as @xmath51 , it is not necessary , as far as solving strong cp problem is concern .",
    "one can imagine taking @xmath50 to be a very high scale , these exotic scalar bosons all decouple and one is left effectively , at low energy , with a standard km model with small tree level @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the model does not explain the fermion hierarchy problem , it does tie up the fermion hierarchy problem with the strong cp problem in the sense that , the smallest of one - loop @xmath0 is related to the smallness of off - diagonal @xmath52 values .",
    "in the model proposed by masiero and yanagida@xcite , the existing three generations are extended with another three generations .",
    "the new three generations are individually @xmath53 singlets and vector - like ; nonetheless , the hypercharges are chosen such that they have same electric charges as the known generations",
    ". therefore they are labelled by @xmath54 in an analogous fashion with the known quarks , @xmath55 the only difference between the two sets of fermions is in @xmath53 assignments . a horizontal flavor symmetry @xmath56 transforms every weyl fermion multiplet above in the fundamental representation , labelled by generation index @xmath57 .",
    "there are new neutral ( and inert to @xmath58 ) higgs bosons : three @xmath56 octets @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) and a singlet @xmath62 .",
    "the yukawa couplings in the hamiltonian is @xmath63 with the usual @xmath53 higgs doublet @xmath21 which couples to fermions in a way crossing two kinds of fermions .",
    "we denote @xmath64 .",
    "an alert reader will tell that a criterion is need to distinguish @xmath65 from @xmath66 , or @xmath67 from @xmath68 .",
    "ref.@xcite imposed a discrete symmetry under which @xmath69 and all @xmath70 , @xmath62 fields are odd , while @xmath71 and @xmath72 are even .",
    "the vev s of @xmath70 s and @xmath62 and @xmath21 give rise to the @xmath73 mass matrix term @xmath74 here @xmath36 is the heavy allowed vector mass of the @xmath72 field .",
    "the @xmath73 matrix has real determinant when couplings are real , as required by the imposed cp symmetry .",
    "note that the singlet is necessary , otherwise the hermitian mass matrix will be traceless which is no allowed phenomenologically . also note that to break cp and to have most general hermitian mass matrix , one need all components of the octets to develop vev , this is why it is necessary for have three octets .",
    "it is not clear whether this has been proved in the literature or not .    integrating out the exotic generation @xmath72",
    ", we have the effective mass matrix for the known generations , @xmath75 which is hermitian with real determinant . some components of gellmann matrices @xmath76 are complex to produce the desired ckm phenomenology of cp violation .    the effective mass can be understood as the amplitude given by the diagram below .",
    "it is a kind of see - saw mechanism in the quark sector .",
    "similar formulas occur for the up - type quarks .     a see - saw diagram for the effective masses of the known 3 generation . , width=302 ]    it is interesting to note that the mass matrix is hermitian certainly because the @xmath7 symmetry plus spontaneous cp violation , the fact that @xmath77 are octet .",
    "however even after su(3 ) is broken , the hermiticity of the mass matrix is still maintained .",
    "as long as the mass matrix is block - hermitian , the contribution to @xmath0 will vanish .",
    "so , to look for contribution to @xmath0 , one looks for loop induced operator that may violate this hermiticity , such as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a function of @xmath70 or @xmath62 .",
    "the discrete symmetry requires function @xmath79 to be of even power .",
    "however , since the fermion bilinear can only either be @xmath7 singlet or octet , @xmath79 has to be effective singlet or octet .",
    "naively it may seem that there will be a one loop contribution to @xmath0 at this point .",
    "however , as shown in ref.@xcite , the one loop @xmath0 remains zero in this model .",
    "note that higgs scalar potential can not break parity .",
    "it can be done only by chiral fermions .",
    "but since p is already broken by the chiral fermion in sm , violation of charge conjugation in the higgs vev produces cp violation .",

    "this can be done by any irrep in nonabelian group as long as one uses enough copies .",
    "we call this `` nonabelian cp violation ''",
