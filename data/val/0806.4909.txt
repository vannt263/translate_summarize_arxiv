    "at modern electron  positron ( @xmath0 ) accelerators built for a deeper and deeper understanding of the fundamental interactions between elementary particles , the machine ( integrated ) luminosity can be derived precisely by means of the relation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the number of events and the theoretical cross section of a given reference process , respectively . because of the latter relation , the reference process must be a reaction with clean topology , high statistics and calculable with high theoretical accuracy , to maintain small the total luminosity error given by the sum in quadrature of the relative experimental and theoretical uncertainty .",
    "for example , at high  energy accelerators lep / slc running in the 90s around the @xmath4 pole to perform precision tests of the standard model , the process of @xmath0 production ( bhabha scattering  @xcite ) , with the final  state leptons detected at small scattering angles , was used because dominated by the electromagnetic interaction and , therefore , calculable in perturbation theory , at least in principle , with very high theoretical accuracy .",
    "a total ( experimental plus theoretical ) precision of @xmath5 was achieved at the end of lep / slc operation @xcite , thanks to the work of different theoretical groups and the excellent performances of precision luminometers .    at presently running @xmath0 colliders of moderately high energy ( between about 1 gev and 10  gev ) , such as the @xmath6factories da@xmath6ne and",
    "vepp2 m , the charm  factories cesr and bepc , as well as the @xmath7factories kek  b and pep  ii ( globally denoted as flavour factories ) , the normalization reaction primarily used is the large ",
    "angle bhabha process @xcite .",
    "actually , at all flavour factories , the final  state leptons are detected at wide scattering angles , within a typical central acceptance region of @xmath8 , because of the absence of dedicated luminosity counters , for example , at small scattering angles .",
    "a precision luminosity measurement at flavour factories is of utmost importance to perform accurate measurements of the @xmath9 cross section , which is , in turn , a key ingredient in high  precision calculations of the running of @xmath10 and lepton @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that high theoretical accuracy and , in particular , comparison with precise data require the development of sophisticated monte carlo ( mc ) programs , including radiative corrections with a relative precision at the per mille level . in this review ,",
    "only the large  angle bhabha generators used at present @xmath0 colliders will be considered .",
    "a description of the small  angle bhabha programs available in the literature and used at lep can be found in @xcite .",
    "since pure weak corrections are completely irrelevant in the energy range explored by flavour factories , the dominant part of radiative corrections , _ i.e. _ leading  log qed contributions , can be kept under control by means of different theoretical methods , such as qed structure functions ( sf ) @xcite and yennie  frautschii  suura ( yfs ) exponentiation  @xcite , as done in many applications to precision physics at lep  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the generator babayaga v3.5 @xcite , a pure qed parton shower ( ps ) is implemented , through a mc solution of the qed dglap equation satisfied by the electron sf in the non  singlet approximation .",
    "once the electron sf is numerically derived , the qed corrected cross section can be simply obtained by dressing the hard  scattering cross section of the process under consideration with a sf for any charged leg .",
    "a remarkable advantage of this universal approach is that the four  momenta of the final  states products ( charged particles and photons ) can be exclusively generated through the shower cascade , as in the case of the qcd ps programs for the momenta of quarks and gluons .",
    "final state . from  @xcite . ]    a comparison between babayaga predictions and data published by the kloe collaboration for the measured energy distribution of the @xmath0 pairs produced in the large  angle bhabha process at da@xmath6ne is reported , from @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ kloe ] , showing a nice agreement between data and theory . in spite of that , it is clear that an obvious drawback of a pure ps generator like babayaga v3.5 is that it lacks the effect of @xmath12 non  logarithmic contributions and , therefore , the corresponding theoretical accuracy is limited to that of a leading  log ( ll ) approximation .",
    "however , the physical precision of the formulation underlying such a program can be substantially improved from about a per cent accuracy down to the per mille level by performing a matching of the exact next  to  leading ( nlo ) corrections with the multiple photon effects taken into account by the ps .",
    "this matching procedure , which is described in detail in @xcite , allows to obtain an @xmath12 corrected cross section that coincides , by construction , with the exact nlo result , avoiding double counting and preserving resummation of leading contributions .",
    "this theoretical formulation is on the grounds of an improved version of babayaga v3.5 , denoted as babayaga@nlo , having a precision tag of 0.1% .",
    "needless to say , thanks to the matching algorithm , the theoretical error of babayaga@nlo is shifted to @xmath13 contributions of the next  to  next  to  leading ( nnlo ) perturbative expansion .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    theoretical approaches rather similar , at least in their basic ingredients , to that of babayaga@nlo are implemented in the mc programs mcgpj @xcite and bhwide @xcite , both used , as babayaga@nlo , at flavour factories for simulations of the bhabha process .",
    "the former is a generator realized by a dubna  novosibirsk collaboration and includes exact @xmath12 corrections supplemented with higher  order ll effects taken into account through collinear sf , resulting in a theoretical precision estimated by the authors to be better than 0.2% .",
    "the latter is a mc code developed by the krakow  knoxville group at the time of lep operation and implements exact @xmath12 corrections matched with the resummation of soft and collinear logarithms via yfs exponentiation . according to @xcite , the precision of bhwide",
    "is conservatively estimated about 0.5% for lep1 . however , since the theoretical ingredients of bhwide are very similar to the formulation of both babayaga@nlo and mcgpj , it is reasonable to assume that its theoretical accuracy for physics simulations at flavour factories is at the level of 0.1% , as discussed in the following .    concerning the theoretical precision of all the above generators , it is important to emphasize that the bulk of the most important sub  leading @xmath14 corrections , namely @xmath15 photonic contributions enhanced by infrared logarithms , where @xmath16 is the large collinear logarithm , is effectively incorporated in the tools babayaga@nlo , mcgpj and bhwide by means of factorization of @xmath12 non  log terms with the leading @xmath12 contributions taken into account in the ps , collinear sf and yfs exponentiation approaches , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "to get an idea of which corrections are relevant to achieve a per mille precision in simulations of the bhabha scattering at flavour factories , we show in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] the relative effect of various contributions to the large ",
    "angle bhabha cross section , when considering typical selection criteria at @xmath6 ( set up a. and b. ) and @xmath7factories ( set up c. and d. )  ( see  @xcite for details ) .    from tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] , it can be seen that @xmath12 corrections decrease the bhabha cross section of about 15% at the @xmath6factories and of about 2025% at the @xmath7factories . within the full set of @xmath12 corrections ,",
    "non  log terms are of the order of 0.5% , almost independently of the centre - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy , as expected , and with a mild dependence on the angular acceptance cuts , as due to box / interference contributions .",
    "the effect of higher  order corrections due to multiple photon emission is about 0.5 - 1% at the @xmath6factories and reaches 12% at the @xmath7factories .",
    "the contribution of ( approximate ) @xmath17 corrections is not exceeding the 0.1% level , while the vacuum polarization increases the cross section of about 2% around 1 gev and of about 56% around 10  gev . concerning the latter correction , the non  perturbative hadronic contribution to the running of @xmath18",
    "is included in babayaga@nlo both in the lowest  order and one  loop diagrams through the hadr5n routine @xcite , that returns a data driven error , thus affecting the accuracy of the theoretical calculation .",
    "analogous results about the size of radiative corrections have been obtained recently  @xcite for the process @xmath19 , also of interest for precision luminosity studies at flavour factories . as a whole , these results indicate that both exact @xmath12 and higher  order corrections ( including vacuum polarization ) are necessary for 0.1% theoretical precision .",
    "a typical procedure followed in the literature for establishing the technical precision of mc generators is to perform tuned comparisons between independent predictions , using the same set of experimental cuts .",
    "an example of such tuned comparisons is given in  @xcite , where it is shown that the agreement between the predictions of babayaga@nlo and bhwide at the @xmath6factories is well below 0.1% , and that also the agreement between babayaga@nlo and labspv , which is a benchmark code by our group with a formulation based on collinear sf very similar to mcgpj , is very good , below the 0.1% level .",
    "this level of agreement , together with further considerations about the size of two  loop corrections discussed in the next subsection , is the reason why in the latest publication by kloe collaboration about the measurement of the hadronic cross section at da@xmath6ne  @xcite the relative uncertainty assigned to theory in the luminosity measurement is now 0.1% , resulting in a total luminosity error of 0.3% .",
    "similar comparisons have been performed between the results of babayaga@nlo and bhwide by a. denig and a. hafner of babar collaboration , in the presence of realistic selection cuts for luminosity at pep  ii .",
    "their studies show that the two generators agree at the 0.1% level , both for integrated and differential cross sections , in the physical and statistical significant regions .",
    "an example of such a comparison , showing the predictions of bhwide , babayaga@nlo and babayaga v3.5 for the electron energy distribution ( upper panels ) , as well as the relative differences between the results of bhwide and the two babayaga versions ( lower panels ) , is given in fig .",
    "[ andreas ] .      in order to assess the physical precision of the generators , the methods typically used are _",
    "i ) _ to compare with @xmath13 calculations , if the latter  as in the case of bhabha scattering  are available in the literature  @xcite _ ii ) _ to estimate the size of unaccounted higher  order contributions .    concerning point _",
    "i ) _ and considering , for definiteness , the generator babayaga@nlo , the strategy consists in deriving from the general formulation the @xmath13 cross section , which can be cast in the following form @xmath20 where , in principle , each of the above @xmath13 contributions is affected by an uncertainty , to be properly estimated . in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) , the first contribution is the cross section including @xmath13 soft plus virtual corrections , whose uncertainty can be evaluated by comparison with the available nnlo calculations .",
    "the @xmath21 of babayaga@nlo has been compared , in particular , with the calculation by penin @xcite , who computed the complete set of two  loop virtual photonic corrections in the limit @xmath22 supplemented by real soft - photon radiation up to non  logarithmic accuracy , and the calculations by bonciani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who computed two  loop fermionic corrections ( in the one  family approximation ) with finite mass terms and the addition of soft bremsstrahlung and real pair contributions .     of babayaga@nlo and the @xmath13 calculations @xcite ( photonic ) and @xcite ( @xmath23 ) , as a function of the infrared regulator . from @xcite . ]",
    "the results of such comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2loopeps ] and in fig .",
    "[ 2loopem ] , for set up a. at the @xmath6factories . in fig .",
    "[ 2loopeps ] , @xmath24 is the difference between @xmath21 of babayaga@nlo and the cross sections of the two @xmath13 calculations , denoted as photonic ( penin ) and @xmath23 ( bonciani _ et al .",
    "_ ) , as a function of the logarithm of the infrared regulator @xmath25 .",
    "it can be seen that the differences are given by flat functions , demonstrating that such differences are infrared  safe , as expected , as a consequence of the universality and factorization properties of the infrared divergences . in fig .",
    "[ 2loopem ] , @xmath24 is shown as a function of the logarithm of a fictitious electron mass and for a fixed value of @xmath26 .",
    "since the difference with the calculation by penin is given by a straight line , this indicates that the two  loop soft plus virtual photonic corrections missing in babayaga@nlo are @xmath17 not infrared  enhanced contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference with the calculation by bonciani _",
    "shows that the fermionic two  loop effects missing in babayaga@nlo are dominated by @xmath27 contributions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , as shown in detail in  @xcite , the sum of the differences with the two @xmath13 calculations does not exceed the @xmath28 level , for all the considered set up at @xmath6 and @xmath7factories .",
    "the second term in eq .  ( [ a2 ] ) is the cross section containing the one  loop corrections to single hard bremsstrahlung and its uncertainty can be estimated by relying on partial results existing in the literature . actually , the exact perturbative expression of @xmath29 is not available yet for full @xmath30 bhabha scattering , but , using the results valid for small  angle bhabha scattering  @xcite and large  angle @xmath31channel processes @xcite , the relative uncertainty of babayaga@nlo in the calculation of @xmath29 can be safely estimated at the level of 0.05% . the third contribution in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) is the double hard bremsstrahlung cross section , whose uncertainty can be evaluated by comparison with the exact @xmath32 cross section . as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "the differences registered between @xmath33 as in babayaga@nlo and the exact calculation are really negligible , at the @xmath34 level .",
    "summing all the results for the various sources of uncertainty , it turns out that the total theoretical error in babayaga@nlo is @xmath35% , when also including the uncertainty due to the running of @xmath18 as returned by the hadr5n routine and the contribution , at a few 0.01% level , of light pairs radiation  @xcite , still missing in babayaga@nlo .",
    "during the last few years , there has been a significant progress in reducing the theoretical uncertainty in bhabha generators used at presently running @xmath0 colliders down to 0.1% .",
    "exact @xmath12 and multiple photon corrections are necessary ingredients to achieve such a precision .",
    "these corrections are implemented in three generators ( babayaga@nlo , bhwide and mcgpj ) for the large  angle bhabha process , which agree within @xmath36 for integrated cross sections and @xmath37 ( or better ) for differential distributions  @xcite .",
    "nnlo qed calculations are essential to establish the theoretical accuracy of existing generators and , if necessary , to improve it below 0.1% .",
    "in particular , the one  loop corrections to single hard bremsstrahlung should be calculated for full bhabha scattering , to get a better control of the theoretical precision .    for next generation @xmath0 accelerators ( ilc / gigaz ) ,",
    "if a @xmath38 accuracy is assumed , present mc bhabha programs need to be improved by the inclusion of weak and two  loop qed corrections , as well as beamstrahlung and new , more precise @xmath39 parameterizations",
