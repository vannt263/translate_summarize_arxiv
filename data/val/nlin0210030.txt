    "in our contribution to this special issue on random matrix theory ( rmt ) , we address the subject of wave field evolution governed by linear wave equations . in particular , our interest is in the sensitivity of evolution to perturbations .",
    "the treatment of this problem illustrates two well - known , important lessons arising in rmt studies .",
    "first , rmt and semiclassical theories , when used in tandem , give a much stronger theoretical approach to a problem than either was capable of on its own  @xcite .",
    "second , even though rmt is inherently unphysical in certain ways , nevertheless , careful application leads to physically meaningful predictions  @xcite .",
    "for example , using rmt to mock up the evolution of a wave packet generates a dispersal into the entire hilbert space simultaneously .",
    "thus , it lacks a dynamical continuity property that a semiclassical theory would easily reveal as absurd .",
    "it turns out that for a wave mechanical system with a chaotic underlying ray dynamics , there is a logarithmic time scale dependence on the wave vector  @xcite , and rmt does not `` know '' about this ; i.e.  its results can not be trusted for wave propagation up to this time scale .",
    "yet , beyond the so - called logtime ( where the semiclassical dynamics increases in complexity exponentially  @xcite ) , rmt can be a powerful tool for understanding the statistical nature of the dynamics .",
    "in what follows , we take advantage of the rmt - semiclassical complementarity and avoid making inferences about pre - logtime dynamics .",
    "the study of the sensitivity of wave field evolution to perturbation has recently attracted a great deal of interest  @xcite for several fundamental reasons , i.e.  decoherence , reversibility , tomography ... in the case in which the basic system is weakly coupled to an environment , the sensitivity relates to the manner in which the system decoheres  @xcite .",
    "the recent focus on quantum computation has greatly increased the attention given to this issue  @xcite .",
    "another motivation has been the reversibility of wave field evolutions such as the spin polarization echoes in nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite . for a broad class of problems ,",
    "propagating forward in time with two slightly different systems is mathematically equivalent to propagating forward with one system and reversing the dynamics with another for the same propagation time .",
    "another application is to problems of waves propagating through random media ( wprm ) , the medium is likely partially characterized and often slowly evolving ; twinkling of starlight passing through the atmosphere is an example .",
    "the interest is often in performing tomography or at least knowing what information can be deduced about the medium  @xcite .",
    "similar statements can be made regarding the study of disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "lastly , we mention that problems involving simple , chaotic systems or even strongly interacting , many - body systems usually require taking measurements as a function of some system parameter . for these systems , single measurements may almost seem like random number generation , whereas it turns out that important information can be extracted from the parameter variations of the measurements  @xcite .",
    "the trick is to know what information therein exists .",
    "our focus here will remain on the wave field evolution behavior without getting into specific physical applications .",
    "introduced nearly twenty years ago , a natural measure of the sensitivity of wave field evolution is the fidelity , which is defined as the squared overlap of some initial state propagated forward in time with two slightly different systems  @xcite . for normalized wavefunctions ,",
    "it begins at unity and typically decays to some small value . in the spin polarization experiments previously cited",
    ", it was observed that a change in the functional form of the fidelity s decay occurred depending upon the dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "the decay exhibited either gaussian or exponential behaviors and in some instances both .",
    "this mirrors known behavior found in simple , quantized chaotic systems  @xcite ; note that there also exists some work on integrable , near - integrable , and mixed phase space systems  @xcite which exhibit other behaviors . for extremely weak perturbation strengths , quantum perturbation theory along with some simplifying assumptions quickly",
    "lead to the prediction of a gaussian decay  @xcite . for larger perturbation strengths , this approach fails , and a fermi golden rule regime emerges which implies an exponential decay behavior  @xcite .",
    "semiclassical theory gives this decay rate in terms of a classical action diffusion constant  @xcite .",
    "if the perturbation strength is even larger , at some point the fidelity decay rate saturates because it is impossible to decay faster than the logtime  @xcite ; this is known as the lyapunov regime because the rate is independent of the perturbation strength , and often determined by the lyapunov exponent .",
    "regardless of the strength of the perturbation or the nature of the dynamics , for very short times the fidelity is quadratic .",
    "this regime which can be derived by using time dependent perturbation theory may be extremely short in time and difficult to observe .",
    "likewise , in the long time limit , the fidelity will saturate to the inverse of the effective number of states in the system .",
    "both of these effects decrease in importance in the asymptotic limit , and are disregarded in what follows ; the lyapunov regime is also disregarded since that involves pre - logtime dynamics .    in this article",
    "we concentrate on developing a uniform approximation that encompasses both the gaussian and exponential decays as well as the intermediate regime for simple chaotic systems ; and we restrict our attention to the schrdinger wave equation .",
    "the fidelity undergoes a crossover from exponential to gaussian behavior as a function of time , and the value of the perturbation strength determines whether the crossover is visible .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the only information residing in the decay of the fidelity is the density of states and the transition parameter of rmt  @xcite ; the spreading width could also substitute for the transition parameter .",
    "alternatively , using semiclassical arguments , one could also say that the only information contained is the phase space volume and the classical action diffusion constant  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the gaussian and exponential fermi golden rule regimes found in simple quantized chaotic systems . in sect .  3 ,",
    "a uniform approximation is derived using rmt and a degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "the theory is applied to the quantized standard map in sect .",
    "4 . it is found to give an excellent approximation of the quantum results .",
    "we then conclude with some discussion and closing remarks .",
    "consider an evolving quantum wave function @xmath0 where @xmath1 defines the parameters of a hamiltonian , @xmath2 .",
    "the overlap of the same initial state , @xmath3 , propagated via two different hamiltonians specified by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the unitary evolution operator , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . in the limit that the system is strongly chaotic , the statistical properties of the overlap are independent of @xmath1 , so we omit the @xmath1 subscript from here on .",
    "the fidelity is just the absolute square overlap @xmath10 it is sufficient to work with the overlap itself in developing the theory since the operation of squaring only introduces cross - correlation effects higher order in @xmath11 that can be ignored .    by inserting complete sets of states , the overlap can be rewritten in terms of the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the perturbed and unperturbed systems as @xmath12 t / \\hbar\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture  @xcite and later works suggest that for a chaotic system , it is appropriate to apply rmt arguments to understand its statistical behavior",
    ". here , as mentioned already , one has to add the caveat - as long as @xmath11 is weak enough that @xmath13 decays on a much longer time scale than the logtime .",
    "the first property we would like to invoke is the invariance of the ensemble over changes in bases .",
    "thus , any rotation to a different initial state must generate the same decay behavior for the fidelity .",
    "it suffices to make an average over a complete set of initial wave functions @xmath14 to obtain @xmath15 t / \\hbar\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of states in the complete set .",
    "rmt has been shown to be a strongly ergodic theory  @xcite , which in this case implies that the fluctuations of the quantity @xmath17 vanish with increasing matrix dimensionality as @xmath18 .",
    "the averaged overlap may be decomposed into a diagonal and off - diagonal part @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\        & + & { 1 \\over n }          \\sum_n \\sum_{m \\ne n } |\\langle n_{\\lambda_1 } |          m_{\\lambda_2 } \\rangle|^2 \\exp\\{-\\rmi[e_m(\\lambda_2 )          - e_n(\\lambda_1 ) ] t / \\hbar\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the change in an eigenenergy due to the perturbation . for @xmath21 , the off - diagonal term exactly vanishes , the diagonal term equals unity , and the fidelity does not decay as must be case .",
    "the diagonal term is defined by adiabatically following an eigenlevel as the system s parameters are continuously varied .",
    "it may be further evaluated by ensemble averaging @xmath22 \\right\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is most significant for extremely small perturbation strengths . from quantum perturbation theory ,",
    "the lowest order shift of an eigenvalue depends on the diagonal element of the perturbation whereas the rotation of the eigenstates depends on off - diagonal elements and energy differences . within rmt",
    "the perturbation matrix elements are uncorrelated and thus to lowest order in @xmath11 , the ensemble averaging of the amplitudes and phases can be separated .",
    "the average over the phases is over a gaussian probability density for the diagonal matrix elements . also , the ensemble average of the amplitude is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the variance of the diagonal matrix elements of the perturbation @xmath26 defined by writing the hamiltonian locally as @xmath27 . in the limit of a differential @xmath11",
    ", @xmath25 is equal to the variance of the level slopes by the hellmann - feynman theorem  @xcite .",
    "if the perturbations are sufficiently small such that the eigenfunctions do not significantly vary , i.e. @xmath28 , then the off - diagonal terms will be negligible and may be ignored .",
    "hence , the fidelity has a gaussian decay in time in the weak perturbation regime .",
    "the diagonal matrix element ( level slope ) variance is not a free parameter , and can be given an elegant interpretation through a semiclassical approach  @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of classical orbits with identical action and @xmath31 is the total mean density of states . the index @xmath32 for time - reversal - invariant systems and @xmath33 for time - reversal - breaking systems .",
    "@xmath34 is the classical action diffusion constant on the energy surface @xmath35 given by  @xcite @xmath36 in this expression the averaging is defined over the primitive periodic orbits of long period .",
    "the physical picture is that the action difference of two long orbits continuously deformable into each other as a function of @xmath11 is the result of a diffusive process .",
    "as the orbit explores the phase space `` randomly '' , sometimes its action increases relative to the other orbit , sometimes it decreases .",
    "the variance of that diffusion is proportional to the variance of the level slopes .",
    "the above analysis describes a very restricted range of perturbation @xmath11 centered at zero .",
    "a semiclassical approach without the quantum perturbation limitations can be developed that is valid over a much broader range .",
    "the semiclassical construction of an evolving wave function begins with the propagator @xmath37 the phase is specified by the time integral of the lagrangian @xmath38 and and an index based on the properties of the conjugate points ( like focal points ) , @xmath39 .",
    "the overlap decay in terms of the propagator is @xmath40 for the reasons given in the discussion surrounding equation  ( [ aeps ] ) , there can be no overlap decay dependence on the specific initial state for chaotic systems as long as the decay is on a time scale which is much longer than the logtime .",
    "since we have explicitly excluded the lyapunov regime from consideration in this paper , we are free to choose any form for the initial state . for convenience , we take gaussian wave packets @xmath41\\ ] ] the initial coordinate of the actions are expanded about the center of the wave packet @xmath42 changes in the amplitudes are ignored , since the most important contribution to the overlap decay is each orbit s action change due to its division by @xmath43 . applying stationary phase on the @xmath44 and @xmath45 integrals , we obtain @xmath46 \\rmd { \\bf q}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a magnitude which disappears from the expressions ahead , but could be deduced using the equations in the appendix of  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 are the action differences of two rays that begin at @xmath49 and end at position @xmath44 in a time @xmath50 and are continuously deformable into each other ; bifurcations are neglected .",
    "first order classical perturbation theory gives @xmath51 the stability matrix elements and the lagrangian are evaluated along the orbits of @xmath2 . in general ,",
    "stationary phase integration can not be performed on the last integral because the action differences are less than @xmath43 .    again",
    "a statistical argument can be employed .",
    "the weighted phases will be nearly gaussian distributed for the reason mentioned earlier that long orbit action changes are part of a diffusion process  @xcite .",
    "the last integral and summation in equation  ( [ eq : semi ] ) can be replaced by a gaussian integral .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the variance of the action differences and is given by  @xcite @xmath54 with the same action diffusion constant as before .",
    "in contrast to the quantum perturbative argument giving a quadratic @xmath50-dependence in the exponential , here the argument is linear .",
    "the semiclassical argument does not contain the action correlations necessary for the theory to contain the quantization of the spectrum .",
    "it therefore misses the gaussian contribution from the diagonal terms , and essentially evaluates the off - diagonal contribution in the regime of larger perturbations as though there is a continuum .",
    "the last form given in the equation exhibits the fermi golden rule form expected for such circumstances .",
    "note that the symmetry factors do not enter @xmath34 ( the symmetry dependences cancel in the final form ) in contrast to the diagonal term .",
    "a straightforward argument determines the value of @xmath11 which separates the exponential and gaussian regimes . we emphasize that this is _",
    "not _ the cross - over to exponential dependence beginning from the quadratic time dependence derived using time - dependent perturbation theory , but rather the relative strength of contributions from diagonal versus off - diagonal contributions in equation  ( [ aeps1 ] ) .",
    "note that either dependence dominates over the time range in which the other s argument of the exponential takes on the lesser value .",
    "a cross - over between the two regimes occurs when their arguments are equal .",
    "simple algebra gives the this time scale @xmath55 , which is the heisenberg time , @xmath56 , to within the symmetry factor .",
    "exponential decay dominates if the decay is completed by @xmath56 , and gaussian decay dominates if little decay has occurred by @xmath56 . in between it",
    "turns out that the decay has components of both behaviors . in terms of the parameters ,",
    "the question is whether @xmath57 it turns out using the results derived next that near the equality , the magnitude of the off - diagonal term is comparable to the diagonal term .",
    "returning to equation  ( [ adiag ] ) , it is an oversimplification to take the amplitude equal to unity .",
    "instead , we define the fraction @xmath58 and ahead give a theory for its value in the neighborhood of unity ( small @xmath11 ) using a degenerate perturbation theory and rmt .",
    "it is worth noting the broader significance of the quantity @xmath59 .",
    "it and some closely related measures have previously been studied by several authors . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors give the leading analytic correction from unity for the case of broken time reversal symmetry , and infer the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath11 , and in  @xcite , a rough guess is given for the full range of behavior consistent with numerical simulations with random matrices .",
    "these measures interpretations as parametric correlators of eigenstates , eigenstate components , or widths were emphasized .",
    "motivations for their introduction come from a broad variety of possibilities of parametric dependence on controllable external or uncontrollable variables such as electromagnetic fields , thermodynamics quantities , or shape / geometric properties .",
    "physical realizations from nuclear fission to quantum dots to atomic and molecular spectroscopy are possible .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same quantity is entering into the theory of the fidelity , but only for transition values of @xmath11 between the two domains giving exponential and gaussian decay .",
    "the argument giving a gaussian behavior for the phase average remains valid to a regime where @xmath59 is quite small and the diagonal term negligible .",
    "it suffices to evaluate @xmath59 to complete a more broadly applicable expression for the diagonal term .",
    "the off - diagonal term is more subtle . by normalization",
    ", the prefactor must be equal to @xmath60 , but the argument of the exponential needs to be determined .",
    "recall that semiclassical dynamics is valid far beyond the logtime , but breaks down on algebraic scales before @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this implies that in the limit of a very weak perturbation , the exponential scale as previously derived places the exponential behavior beyond @xmath56 .",
    "the semiclassical expression turns out to require modification .",
    "since it is valid on time scales shorter than @xmath56 , we can expand the exponential to the linear time term .",
    "this implies that in this regime the argument of the exponential multiplied by @xmath60 must be equal to the argument found in the previous subsection .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation , the overlap can be written @xmath61 where the first form emphasizes the quantum information ( matrix element variance or level slope variance ) , and the second form emphasizes the classical information ( classical action diffusion constant ) .",
    "the transition between the two regimes , gaussian and exponential , as the strength of the perturbation is increased , is given by the fraction @xmath59 remaining in the diagonal overlap factor .",
    "the exponential decay rate has been modified by the introduction of @xmath62 in the denominator which is necessary to offset the reduced normalization . in the limit of large perturbations",
    "where @xmath63 we recover the previous results for the exponential fermi golden rule decay , and in the small perturbation limit , @xmath64 , the gaussian decay .      to derive the leading corrections to @xmath59 for both time - reversal - invariant and noninvariant cases",
    ", the most direct approach would be to use the second order perturbation theory expression @xmath65 ^ 2 } + \\cdots\\ ] ] where @xmath66 .",
    "within rmt , @xmath26 is a gaussian random matrix with the correct symmetries , gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , unitary ensemble ( gue ) , etc ... we only consider the time - reversal - invariant and time - reversal - noninvariant cases , goe and gue respectively .",
    "define an energy variable @xmath67 rescaled by the mean local spacing and a unit variance variable @xmath68 for the perturbation matrix elements .",
    "then the above sum can be reexpressed as the following double integral @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the transition parameter and @xmath71 is the local variance of the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath71 are defined for the irreducible representations of the system . if there are symmetries , then these quantity must be adjusted accordingly by dividing out these symmetries , eg .",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the function @xmath75 is a sequence of @xmath76-functions which determine the spacings , and is known as the two - point density correlation function . similarly , the function @xmath77 is a sequence of @xmath76-functions whose intensities determine the matrix elements . crudely speaking , taking the ensemble average of the above expression",
    "is reduced to inserting the @xmath75 function from the appropriate gaussian ensemble , and taking @xmath77 to be a zero - centered , unit variance , gaussian probability density independent of @xmath67 .",
    "it was emphasized by french and co - workers that the transition parameter @xmath78 was quite general  @xcite .",
    "although it naturally emerged from perturbation theories , its relevance extended to entire symmetry breaking transitions and it is the only scale that can enter those problems ; a similar statement applies to parametric statistics as well  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to understand that for @xmath67 near zero , the integral diverges for the goe , and that this approach must fail to give proper results for @xmath59 .",
    "the two - point correlation function is approximately linear , @xmath79 , so the above integral will diverge logarithmically .",
    "however , we can apply a degenerate perturbation theory approach developed in  @xcite ; the degenerate theory also gives an extra valid correction for the gue . by diagonalizing a two by two matrix",

    "the @xmath67-independent terms give the desired result .",
    "the remaining @xmath67-dependent terms arising from the @xmath84 $ ] integral vanish as higher order terms in the power series of @xmath75 are included in the first integral . in this way",
    ", the final result does not depend on the value chosen for @xmath67 . carrying out this technique up to but not including @xmath92",
    ", we obtain @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the euler constant .",
    "the goe results and the correction term ( @xmath95 ) for the gue are new , and the leading gue term is consistent with reference  @xcite , which also gives the asymptotic results @xmath96    the overlap ensemble average is expected to be universal and should apply to all systems chaotic enough to expect rmt behavior .",
    "numerical studies and heuristic arguments suggest that the overlap between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates is roughly a lorentzian - like function of the perturbation strength  @xcite .",
    "we look for a dependence of the form @xmath97 note that in the previously discussed forms , the expression for @xmath59 was raised to the power @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and approximate values of the constants @xmath100 were given by a numerical fit .",
    "using perturbation theory wilkinson and walker  @xcite gave an expression for the individual off - diagonal matrix elements which has a compatible form .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath101 and @xmath102 corrections plus the asymptotic expressions indicate difficulties with their interpolation since it gets both limits of small and large @xmath78 incorrectly",
    ". equations  ( [ eq : beta]-[eq : lorentzian ] ) are , of course , insufficient to determine @xmath103 .",
    "however , we suggest the following as perhaps the simplest forms for somewhat improved interpolations that are at least analytically consistent with the limiting regimes of large and small @xmath78 : @xmath104 the use of a quotient of two polynomials inserts a general function with some fitting parameters that we determined with goe and gue monte carlo simulations ; see the appendix for the monte carlo details .",
    "our best fits are : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "figure  [ fig : interpolation ] shows the differences between the monte carlo results and the new interpolations along with the differences between the monte carlo results and those from references  @xcite .",
    "even though the new interpolations have the correct limiting forms , they still appear to have some small , detectable deviations from the exact rmt predictions . perhaps , the main conclusion is that the previous interpolations do surprisingly well given that they fail to get any of the limiting cases correctly",
    ".    again , semiclassical theory fixes the value of @xmath78 using the arguments presented in the previous section .",
    "thus , @xmath108 where the last form follows from equation  ( [ diag2 ] ) . in some simple systems such as the standard map used in the next section , @xmath34 can be calculated analytically .",
    "in fact , the criterium , equation  ( [ criter ] ) , for observing either gaussian or exponential behavior can be written in terms of the transition parameter @xmath109 it is remarkable that the same transition parameter that determines the effects of weak symmetry breaking in rmt , gives precisely the exponential - to - gaussian cross - over for the fidelity .",
    "finally , the uniform approximation for the fidelity is the square of equation  ( [ eq : full ] ) with the results given in equations  ( [ eq : lorentzian]-[lam ] ) .",
    "it could have turned out that there were three parameters in the functional form of the decay , the relative amount of gaussian to exponential component ( @xmath59 ) , and the scales in the arguments of the gaussian and exponential functions .",
    "interestingly , other than the density of states ( or phase space volume ) , only one quantity determines all three potential parameters , that being the classical action diffusion constant .",
    "there is no other information contained in the decay of the fidelity for a strongly chaotic system .",
    "we use the standard map , which is a paradigm for chaotic systems , to demonstrate our results for time - reversal - invariant systems . for a kicking strength",

    "the effective planck constant is @xmath114 and the average density of states is @xmath115 .    from the considerations of sect",
    ".  2 , examples of nearly pure gaussian or exponential decay can be found by selecting an appropriate value of @xmath11 using equation  ( [ criter ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : gaussian ] , we see that for small @xmath43 ( large @xmath16 ) , even without initial state averaging , the theoretical curves for the gaussian and exponential regimes respectively match the quantum results .",

    "ergodicity allows the ensemble averaging to be replaced by an average over eigenstates . for quantum maps ,",
    "the transition parameter is defined in terms of the variance of the eigenphases as opposed to the eigenenergies as in continuous systems .",
    "therefore , for the quantized standard map @xmath118\\ ] ] using the goe interpolation expression for @xmath59 in equation  ( [ fl ] ) gives excellent agreement with the quantum results .",
    "finally , we show an example in figure  [ fig : crossover ] where @xmath11 has been chosen so that @xmath119 exhibits both exponential and gaussian behaviors in different time regimes . the theoretical expression given in equation  ( [ eq : full ] ) with equation  ( [ diffu ] ) and",
    "the interpolation approximation for @xmath59 of the previous section compares well over the full time dependence .",
    "it is possible to isolate both the exponential and gaussian components of @xmath119 , and these are shown in the lower panels .",
    "the intercepts of the curves at @xmath120 show the accuracy of the numerical fit to @xmath59 , and the decay scales can be seen to be given properly as well .",
    "the fidelity is extremely useful for studies of decoherence , reversibility , and tomography in several contexts , and has received a great deal of attention recently .",
    "it is to be expected that rmt theory would be helpful in understanding its behavior for strongly chaotic systems .",
    "indeed , we applied rmt to develop a uniform approximation that covers both previously known regimes of gaussian and exponential decay , and the theoretical predictions describe the behavior of the quantized standard map extremely well . although not noted earlier in the text , the range of @xmath78 over which the bare degenerate perturbation theory is accurate , is disappointingly narrow",
    "however , it helped to provide a schema for an improved interpolation formula .",
    "we further included the semiclassical analysis required to show that only one parameter ( other than the density of states / phase space volume ) determined the full behavior , the classical action diffusion constant . in quantum terms , the sole information is carried by the transition parameter or alternatively by the perturbation s spreading width . as a function of this parameter",
    ", the uniform approximation gives a continuous family of universal decay curves for all strongly chaotic systems .",
    "our numerical tests of the time - reversal - invariant uniform approximation with the quantum kicked rotor relied on large dimensionality examples , i.e.  @xmath121 , to show that although we averaged over initial states to generate the theory , the ergodic properties of rmt imply that the results apply individually to nearly any initial state of a strongly chaotic system . for smaller values of @xmath16 , the fluctuations due to not making an initial state averaging increase and are readily visible .",

    "for integrable , near - integrable , and mixed phase space systems , the behavior of the fidelity is not universal and depends upon the initial state chosen .",

    "<S> in quantum / wave systems with chaotic classical analogs , wavefunctions evolve in highly complex , yet deterministic ways . a slight perturbation of the system , though , will cause the evolution to diverge from its original behavior increasingly with time . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence can be measured by the fidelity , which is defined as the squared overlap of the two time evolved states . for chaotic systems , two main decay regimes of either gaussian or exponential behavior have been identified depending on the strength of the perturbation . for perturbation strengths intermediate between the two regimes , the fidelity displays both forms of decay . by applying a complementary combination of random matrix and semiclassical theory , </S>",
