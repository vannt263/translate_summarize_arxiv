    "@xcite    both caspt2@xcite and nevpt2@xcite require the evaluation of higher - order reduced density matrices ( rdms ) in the active space .",
    "the salient properties of nevpt2 ( see below ) requires the four - body rdm , which scales as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of active orbitals .",
    "this @xmath0 scaling , although sub - exponential , still puts a constraint on the active orbital space size tractable by multireference perturbation theory , in particular in combination with a dmrg reference wave function .",
    "therefore , in addition to straightforward implementations such as dmrg - caspt2@xcite or strongly - contracted ( sc- ) dmrg - nevpt2@xcite , several approaches have been proposed to tackle the scaling problem of the higher - order rdms .",
    "the caspt2 implementation of @xcite and the nevpt2 implementation of @xcite employ cumulant - type expansions to approximate the three- and four - body rdms which , however , may entail @xmath2-representability problems of the approximated higher - order rdms and/or lead to numerical instabilities in the perturbation summations .",

    "_ has been recently proposed by neese and co - workers@xcite , who have developed a domain - based pair local natural orbital nevpt2 ( dlpno - nevpt2 ) formulation .",
    "very recently , evangelista and co - workers @xcite put forward a novel second - order multireference perturbation theory based on the driven similarity renormalization group which exploits factorized two - electron integrals to enable an on - the - fly generation of the two - electron repulsion integrals in the mo basis while avoiding any explicit storage of the latter .    in this work",
    "we will take advantage of a cholesky decomposition ( cd ) of the two - electron integral matrix@xcite .",
    "although the idea of cd for two - electron integrals dates back to 1977@xcite , the approach has been only recently fully explored and elaborated by aquilante , pedersen , lindh and co - workers@xcite .",
    "they also implemented cd for traditional multiconfigurational electronic structure methods such as casscf@xcite and caspt2 @xcite .",
    "while these developments have spurred significantly various applications of caspt2 in theoretical inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry@xcite , caspt2 in its most successful formulation contains a parameter ( the so - called ipea shift ) with a default value of 0.25 a.u",
    ".  introduced by @xcite to match a set of experimental dissociation energies of main group diatomics .",
    "the default value of the ipea shift has sparked a controversy among researchers employing caspt2 for problems other than dissociation energies , such as magnetic coupling constants and spin - state energetics of scos@xcite which still remains unsettled .",
    "moreover , caspt2 shows in some cases unstable results due to the so - called intruder - state problem due to the appearance of very small denominators in the perturbation expansion .",
    "this problem has been counteracted with a level - shift technique@xcite , but the final caspt2 energies depend on the value of the level shift .",
    "by contrast , nevpt2 , which is parameter - free and has the noteworthy property to avoid the intruder - state problem ( owing to the sophistication of its zero order hamiltonian ) , not only avoids any ipea - shift controversy but has also shown promising results for spin - state energetics in model compounds and scos@xcite    we here present a dmrg - nevpt2 implementation employing cd that is both capable of treating large active orbital spaces large ao basis sets which allows for multireference calculations on large transition metal complexes that are typically encountered in bioinorganic chemistry . to demonstrate its capabilities we examine the spin - state energetics of two prime examples of scos",
    "as details of the nevpt2 approach , quantum - chemical dmrg and its combination to dmrg - nevpt2 have been discussed in detail elsewhere@xcite , we only outline briefly the cholesky decomposition and show how it is employed in the context of cd - dmrg - nevpt2 .",
    "mathematically , cd@xcite is a special case of a lu decomposition of a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix @xmath3 into a product of a triangular matrix @xmath4 and its transpose , @xmath5 @xmath3 now contains two - electron integrals @xmath6 ( with indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 combined to row and column indices of @xmath3 ) . of particular interest is the incomplete cd , where @xmath3 may be approximated to an arbitrary accuracy with _ cholesky vectors _",
    "@xmath9 , which constitute the columns of the matrix @xmath4@xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is typically significantly smaller than the full dimension of @xmath3 . one important advantage of cd is that the cholesky vectors can be computed without evaluating the full matrix @xmath3@xcite , resulting in large disk space savings .",
    "two - electron integrals may then be reconstructed from the corresponding cholesky vector elements , @xmath12    cd also proves particularly useful in integral transformations : instead of a full - fledged integral transformation , we only need to transform cholesky vectors ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to indices in the ao and mo basis , respectively .",
    "the cost of such a transformation is @xmath16 in contrast to a formal @xmath17 scaling for the full integral transformation . in nevpt2 ,",
    "two - electron integrals with up to two inactive and two virtual orbital indices must be transformed from ao to the mo basis , which is typically the most time consuming step following the calculation of four - body rdms .",
    "additionally , in a multi - state calculation integrals with inactive / virtual indices must be transformed to a state - specific representation . in our implementation of cd - dmrg - nevpt2 the integral transformation based on cholesky vectors yielded by far the largest computational savings .",
    "additionally , we implemented the construction of the fock matrix directly from the cholesky vectors ( albeit without employing the local k screening by @xcite for the exchange contributions ) , however the computational advantage arising from this step is negligible compared to the integral transformation .",

    "is a consequence of the choice of the ci solution within the cas space as the zeroth - order wave function .",
    "this allows to greatly simplify the formalism and to use the four - body rdms only ( otherwise also the five - body rdms would be required ) . obviously , an approximate full ci wave function in the cas space ( as produced by dmrg ) with a formulation assuming an exact full ci wave function can produce numerical problems .",
    "it is furthermore important to stress that the false intruder states are related to this inconsistency , i.e. , they originate from the approximations in the zeroth - order wave function and are unrelated to the standard intruder states .    that the pc approach is much more dependent on the quality of the zeroth - order wave function ( for instance , on the degree of ci convergence ) , whereas sc is more robust and yields more stable results for a lower - quality zeroth - order wave function can be easily understood by considering that each denominator of sc is obtained by a weighted average of a set of denominators in pc ( the weights being related to the interactions of the pc perturbers with the zeroth - order wave function )",
    ". therefore , large variations of the pc denominators for perturbers with a small interaction with the zeroth - order wave function ( which can have important effects on the pc energy if the denominators approach zero ) have almost no effects on sc .",
    "the discrepancy of our ccsd(t)/ano - rcc - vdzp results with the ccsd(t ) results of @xcite ( table  [ tab : model2-energies ] ) might point to a large basis set effect at a first glance .",

    ", the guess orbitals for the reference rohf wave function for the quintet and triplet ccsd(t ) calculation were generated from state - averaged casscf calculations for three quintet states and triplet states to ensure the correct state character ( and similarly in the nevpt2 calculations ) .",
    "the casscf calculations show gaps of 2 - 6kcal / mol between the lowest quintet or triplet states , thus , a black - box single - reference calculation may well converge to an adjacent state , which will affect the spin - state energetics .",

    "<S> we present a second - order _ n_-electron valence state perturbation theory ( nevpt2 ) based on a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) reference wave function that exploits a cholesky decomposition of the two - electron repulsion integrals ( cd - dmrg - nevpt2 ) . with a parameter - free multireference perturbation theory approach at hand , </S>",
    "<S> the latter allows us to efficiently describe static and dynamic correlation in large molecular systems . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the applicability of cd - dmrg - nevpt2 for spin - state energetics of spin - crossover complexes involving calculations with more than 1000 atomic basis functions . </S>",
    "<S> we first assess in a study of a heme model the accuracy of the strongly- and partially - contracted variant of cd - dmrg - nevpt2 before embarking on resolving a controversy about the spin ground state of a cobalt tropocoronand complex . </S>"
