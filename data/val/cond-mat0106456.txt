    "recent developments in the study of one - dimensional ( 1d ) physics have been aimed at observing the somewhat intriguing processes of spin - charge separation and charge fractionalization .",
    "the theoretical study of various interacting 1d systems predicts the decay of the electron into separate spin and charge excitations traveling at different velocities ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also , the charge of the excitations is expected to renormalize in the presence of interactions .",
    "this phenomenon is called charge fractionalization @xcite .",
    "this strongly non - fermi liquid behavior is described by the luttinger liquid theory @xcite .    with the discovery of quasi - one - dimensional systems such as quantum hall effect edge states , quantum wires , and more recently carbon nanotubes ,",
    "there has been good experimental confirmation of this theory @xcite .",
    "however , _",
    "direct _ observation of charge fractionalization or spin - charge separation remains a challenge , and it is believed that spin transport may provide useful insight into the detection of the theoretically predicted separation between charge and spin @xcite .",
    "for example , as seen here , backscattering interactions terms markedly affect spin transport , but do not affect charge transport .    besides providing insight into the physics of luttinger liquids ,",
    "spin transport has also useful technological applications @xcite . because of the long lifetime of spin excitations , the spin of the electron may be useful for information storage or as a transport element , and could have significant applications in fields such as quantum computation @xcite",
    "this paper investigates the effect of electron - electron interactions on spin transport in 1d .",
    "we consider the model of an ideal , infinitely long quantum wire with two transport channels : spin up and spin down . as is well - known , the forward scattering interactions are responsible for charge fractionalization and spin - charge separation , and significantly affect charge transport .",
    "by contrast , the backward scattering processes are marginally irrelevant under the renormalization group flow @xcite , and do not contribute to the transport of charge",
    ". however , the effect of backscattering processes on the spin dynamics can be quite dramatic .",
    "it yields two different regimes @xcite : one characteristic for small temperatures where the magnetization vector spatially precesses about the direction of the spin current , and another one relevant for higher temperatures where spin diffusion dominates . in our analysis",
    "we will only take into account the effects of the backscattering processes ; due to spin - charge separation , we expect these results to be unchanged by the forward scattering .",
    "equations of motion for the spin current and magnetization have been derived in @xcite , mostly phenomenologically .",
    "here we provide a more general approach .",
    "the treatment we use follows closely the kadanoff - baym formalism @xcite , generalized to include the electron spin and chirality .",
    "we use the quantum boltzmann equation in the collision approximation to write down a general form for the spin transport equations .    in the _ hydrodynamic _ limit of small perturbations from equilibrium",
    ", we retrieve the behavior predicted in @xcite . in this limit",
    "we can identify the terms responsible for the precession of the magnetization and for the spin diffusion .",
    "we find the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath0 in qualitative agreement with the estimate of ref.@xcite , but with a different numerical prefactor .",
    "this linearized hydrodynamics is manifestly spin - charge separated , giving us some confidence in the validity of the result .    in the presence of larger perturbations , non - linear terms",
    "appear as well .",
    "an analysis of the full equations of motion may be done numerically .",
    "for the particular case of an injected uniform spin current , we perform a numerical analysis of the equations at various temperatures . at high temperatures ,",
    "we retrieve purely diffusive behavior . in the limit of zero temperature ,",
    "however , the system ceases to show exponentially decaying behavior and we can find an analytic solution for the decay of the spin current .",
    "this solution is in very good agreement with the corresponding numerical results .",
    "we check that the backscattering interactions cause no corrections to the charge and heat transport equations .",
    "a comment on the validity of these results is in order .",
    "it seems quite likely that the quantum boltzmann approach is asymptotically exact in the hydrodynamic regime , due to the marginal irrelevance of backscattering in equilibrium ( up to possible logarithmic corrections requiring a higher - order analysis ) .",
    "the low - temperature limit is , however , much less transparent .",
    "indeed , the quantum boltzmann description is almost certainly not exact in this regime . in particular , while the original formulation is manifestly spin - charge separated , the quantum boltzmann equations are not , but become so in linear response .",
    "thus the decay of the spin current found at low temperatures depends upon the form of the charge distribution functions defined in section iv .",
    "nevertheless , this dependence appears fairly innocuous , and leads to no obvious unphysical behavior for local quantities ( e.g. magnetization , charge density , current , energy density ) .",
    "for this reason , and since the results are in agreement with expectations based on scaling , we find the quantum boltzmann approximation reasonable an this limit as well .    in the following section we write down the spin transport equations .",
    "the derivation of these equations is presented in detail in the appendix . in section iii , we study the perturbative regime and the resulting precessional and diffusive behaviors . in section iv , using numerical and analytical methods , we study the time evolution of a uniform spin current injected into the system .",
    "we present the conclusions in section v.",

    "the forward scattering terms are included as a check .",
    "given the above form for the interactions , we are interested in deriving equations for the generalized wigner distribution functions @xmath11 . for each chirality , these functions form a @xmath12 matrix in the spin space .",
    "if we choose the @xmath13 axis as the reference axis , the diagonal components of this matrix give the distribution functions for the particles with the spin directed upward and downward along this axis .",
    "the off - diagonal components are related to the distributions of particles that have the spin directed along the @xmath14 and @xmath15 axes . in equilibrium",
    "the off diagonal components vanish , while the diagonal ones are equal and independent of space and time , and the wigner matrix can be written as :    @xmath16    @xmath17    we can relate the wigner matrices to the actual spin current and magnetization , as well as with the total charge density and charge current .",
