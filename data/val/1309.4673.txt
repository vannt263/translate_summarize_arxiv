    "the recent discovery of radio pulsations from a magnetar at a projected distance of @xmath3 pc from sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) provides an unparalleled tool for probing the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) toward the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite .",

    "radio follow - up observations of sgr j1745 - 29 ( hereafter psr j17452900 ) have confirmed the high spin down rate , @xmath5 , and yielded a dispersion measure ( dm ) of dm = 1778 @xmath6 3 @xmath7 @xcite , the highest dm of any known radio emitting neutron stars . the ne2001 model for the distribution of galactic electrons @xcite estimates a dm distance for the magnetar that is consistent with the distance of sgr a*. @xcite measure a high rotation measure ( rm ) of @xmath8 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this rm is an order of magnitude larger than all other rms measured within a few tens of parsecs of sgr a * ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and @xcite postulate it is caused by the hot gas component from which sgr a * accretes ( starting at the bondi radius of @xmath00.12 pc ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that the column density inferred from the x - ray spectrum measured by _",
    "nustar _ is consistent with the magnetar being at the distance of the gc , and @xcite compare the column densities measured from x - ray spectra of sgr a * and psr j17452900 from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and infer an upper limit to their physical separation of @xmath9 2 pc .    a surprising result of the radio measurements has been the small pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering of radio waves . the ne2001 model predicts a large pulse broadening timescale of @xmath0 2300 s for a source in the gc .",
    "previously the lack of pulsars observed in the gc , despite strong evidence for their existence in this region ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was explained by extreme scattering of radio waves caused by inhomogeneities in the ionized component of the interstellar medium within @xmath0150 pc of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "scattering causes temporal broadening of pulses which renders pulsar periodicity searches at typical observing frequencies ( @xmath10 ghz ) ineffective .    in this letter , we present detailed multi - frequency measurements of the temporal broadening from psr j17452900 and discuss their implications . in section  [ scattering ]",

    "we discuss our results and summarize in sections  [ discussion ] and [ conclusions ] respectively .",
    "a pulse propagating through the non - uniform , ionized ism will be scattered , leading to the multi - path propagation effects of angular broadening and pulse broadening .",
    "a point source is broadened to a typical observed angular size @xmath11 , and an impulse - shaped pulse is broadened to a characteristic time scale @xmath12 .",
    "these two quantities , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are geometrically related and depend on the properties of the scattering screen ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "mathematically , temporal scattering is described by the pulse broadening function ( pbf ) .",
    "the observed pulse shape is the convolution of the intrinsic pulse shape and the pbf .",
    "the most commonly assumed geometry is a thin screen with infinite transverse extent dominated by the smallest spatial scale , which gives a one - sided exponential pbf @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unit step function , i.e.  @xmath15 , otherwise @xmath16 . if the scattering medium is instead a thick screen , the pbf has a slower rise time than @xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "kolmogorov media have pfbs that decay more slowly than an exponential @xcite .",
    "other possible geometries include scattering screens with limited transverse extent or filaments @xcite .",
    "pulse and angular broadening is also highly frequency - dependent with a typical spectral index @xmath18 proportional to @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "@xcite measured a mean spectral index of @xmath21 for a large ensemble of pulsars with low to moderate dms . @xcite",
    "measured the pulse broadening spectral index of nine pulsars with large dms ( @xmath22 ) and determined a shallower frequency scaling of @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetar was observed with the effelsberg radio telescope at observing frequencies ranging from 1.35 to 18.95 ghz , the nanay radio telescope from 1.5 - 3.2 ghz , and the jodrell bank lovell telescope at 1.5 ghz .",
    "a full list of observing frequencies , bandwidths , and observing dates is given in table  [ tab : dat ] .",
    "the 18.95 ghz data were taken with the p13 mm receiver and xffts digital spectrometer @xcite .",

    "the 14.6 ghz , 8.35 ghz , and 4.6 ghz data were taken with the effelsberg s20 mm , s36 mm , and s60 mm receivers respectively . at 1.4 ghz both the ultra - broadband receiver ( ubb ) and the central pixel of the 21-cm multi - beam receiver ( 7b )",
    "were used . at",
    "the four lower frequencies baseband data were recorded with the psrsterix coherent dedispersion system .",
    "the effelsberg data at 18.95 ghz were dedispersed at dm = 1778 @xmath7 using the presto[multiblock footnote omitted ] pulsar processing software suite .",
    "the dedispersed time series were convolved with a set of boxcar filters of increasing width to increase the sensitivity to broader pulses .",
    "pulses were identified by applying a minimum signal - to - noise ratio threshold of s / n@xmath255 to the convolved dedispersed time series and binned by pulse phase .",
    "a total of 21 pulses with s / n@xmath255 were seen in the on - pulse phase window at boxcar widths ranging from 128 @xmath24s  768 @xmath24s . because the pulses were too weak to fit for scattering individually , a  dejittered \" average profile was created by co - adding short segments of the dedispersed time series centered on each detected pulse .",
    "at all other observing frequencies at effelsberg , the processing went as follows .",
    "the baseband data were coherently dedispersed , and for each rotation of the pulsar , spectral intensity data were generated .",
    "an average pulse profile was generated by integrating over the entire observation . at 4.85 and 8.35",

    "data reduction and rfi excision were performed using the standard psrchive package @xcite .",
    "single pulse time series were generated at 4.85 , 8.35 , and 14.6 ghz for each pulsar rotation by first averaging over frequency .",

    "a short segment of the time series centered on the pulse is extracted and used for the single pulse profile fitting described in section  [ spfit ] .",
    "observations at the nanay radio telescope were taken using the nuppi instrument at three different central frequencies : 1.48 ghz with the low frequency receiver and 2.54 ghz and 3.18 ghz with the high frequency receiver . at all three frequencies , a bandwidth of 512 mhz was split into 1024 channels , coherently dedispersed at a dm of 1830 pc @xmath26 and subsequently folded at the initially measured spin period . because the data were folded in realtime , no single pulses measurements were available .      at jodrell bank",

    "a least squares fit of all of the scattering timescales given in table  [ tab : dat ] versus frequency yielded a scattering spectral index of @xmath18 = @xmath55 , which is consistent with the value of @xmath56 determined by @xcite and @xmath57 from @xcite .",
    "the projected scattering timescale at 1 ghz is @xmath58 = 1.3@xmath60.2 s.",
    "psr j17452900 is the only astronomical object in the gc for which both angular scatter broadening and pulse broadening have been measured , which can constrain the location of the scattering medium @xcite .",
    "the angular size of psr j17452900 measured by bower _",
    "et al . , submitted _ of @xmath59 mas and our measurement of @xmath58 = 1.3@xmath60.2 s place the screen at a distance of @xmath60 6 kpc from the gc ( see bower _",
    "et al . , submitted _ for details ) .",
    "while it is plausible that an hii region in a spiral arm along the line of sight could cause strong scattering , it also implies the scattering in the gc is much lower than previously thought .",
    "if this is true , then many more pulsars in the gc should have been detected in previous search attempts @xcite .",
    "one possible resolution to this apparent contradiction is that the thin screen scattering model is invalid for sources in the gc . @xcite",
    "present a more realistic two - component model with a central spheroid of hot gas and a scattering screen located @xmath0 150 pc from sgr a*. the physical origin of the scattering screen is likely the ionized outer layers of molecular clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this implies that scattering material is patchy with a more complicated spatial structure than a single thin screen .",
    "the ne2001 model @xcite also implements the gc scattering region as an ellipsoid exponential .",
    "an analog to the complex gc scattering may be the time - variable scattering of the crab pulsar due to the complex spatial structure in the crab nebula , which imparts rapid changes in the scattering time scale @xcite and in extreme cases anomalous dispersion events @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the magnetar may be at a larger radial distance from sgr a * but viewed through a filament , that may cause the higher dm but lower scattering , but the large measured rm argues against this interpretation",
    ". continued high precision monitoring of the dm and rm of psr j1745 - 2900 may show whether the source is moving near or within an extended screen boundary .",
    "still , an alternative scenario to be considered is a real paucity of pulsars in the gc , as suggested earlier by johnston ( 1994 ) .",
    "newer results , including the discovery the discovery of psr j17452900 , contradict this possibility . based on population and multi - wavelength studies , reviews of the physical conditions and considerations of the stellar population and indications of their formation history , the number of pulsars expected in the gc is in fact high @xcite .",
    "@xcite predict as many as 100 canonical pulsars and a ten times larger population of millisecond pulsars in the interesting central parsec of the gc .",
    "because radio magnetars are a rare class of pulsar ( 1 in @xmath0500 radio pulsars ) , this detection suggests an even larger population may be present . from this population psr j17452900",
    "is precisely the type of pulsar we expect to detect in a region of strong scattering through selection effects viz .",
    "high luminosity , long period , flat spectrum . if the scattering properties of the psr j17452900 is indicative of the entire gc region , then previous surveys should have detected canonical pulsars .",
    "msps will not be detectable at low frequencies , even with the small scattering time measured here for the magnetar , but high frequency searches could have had the chance to discover some of them @xcite .",
    "still , no discovery was made before the observations of the magnetar .",
    "this apparent contradiction between the low pulse broadening measured for psr j1745 - 2900 and the lack of other pulsar detections suggests that the scattering environment in the gc requires a more complicated spatial model than a single thin scattering screen , and hyperstrong scattering may still dominate most lines - of - sight .    as future searches of the gc with more sensitive telescopes ( e.g. with the square kilometre array , atacama large millimeter array ) are made , and monitoring of the magnetar continues , the question of whether or how we can find pulsars closely orbiting sgr a * will eventually be answered .",
    "we have observed the magnetar psr j17452900 at radio frequencies ranging from 1.2 to 18.95 ghz . like other radio - emitting magnetars ,",
    "the average pulse profile of psr j17452900 is comprised of bright , narrow pulses that jitter in time . using both average pulse profiles and single pulses",
    ", we measured the scatter broadening timescale across an order of magnitude in observing frequency and found @xmath2 s and @xmath61 .",
    "the pulse broadening timescale is several orders of magnitude lower than predicted by models @xcite for a pulsar near sgr a*. if there are truly as many as 100 canonical pulsars in the inner 1 pc around sgr a * , then previous pulsar surveys should have detected many sources .",
    "our models for scattering in the gc require updating after the discovery of this magnetar .",
