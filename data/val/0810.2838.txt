    "nonlocality is a profound notion in quantum mechanics .",
    "quantitative predictions by quantum mechanics are incompatible with constraints which local realism implies on a correlation of measurements between two separate systems .",
    "these constraints are called bell inequalities @xcite . a typical bell inequality for bipartite two - dimensional systems ( two qubits )",
    "was derived by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) @xcite , allowing more flexibility in local measurement configurations than the original bell inequality @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics maximally violates the chsh inequality when the two qubits are in a maximally entangled state and each qubit is measured by two mutually unbiased bases @xcite .",
    "we observe that nonlocality for maximally entangled qubits is most strongly manifested by mutually unbiased bases , similarly to the complementarity principle .    since the discovery by bell @xcite , investigation of nonlocality for more general systems has been regarded as one of the most important challenges in quantum mechanics and quantum information science @xcite .",
    "the studies include nonlocality without inequalities for three or more qubits , presented by greenberger , horne , and zeilinger @xcite . in distinction with the bipartite qubit case",
    ", the contradiction between local realism and quantum mechanics can now be revealed by perfect correlations .",
    "mermin immediately derived statistical inequalities for arbitrarily many qubits and showed that the degree of their violations exponentially increases with an increasing number of parties @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality for multipartite systems plays an important role in quantum information processing , for instance , one way quantum computation with cluster states @xcite .",
    "generalization to higher dimensional systems ( qudits ) has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "nonlocality of two qudits was shown to be more robust against isotropic noises than that of two qubits by numerical analysis @xcite and by analytically deriving collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality @xcite .",
    "_ recently derived inequalities and showed their violations for arbitrary many qudits , including two qudits @xcite .",
    "such inequalities for two qudits can be applied to a bipartite division of many qubits , for instance , a division of @xmath0 qubits into two parties , each having @xmath1 qubits , which is equivalent to a @xmath2 system .",
    "we may ask when such bell inequalities for qudits are maximally violated : are they maximally violated when a maximally entangled state and mutually unbiased measurements are employed , as in the chsh inequality for two qubits ?",
    "it was shown that the cglmp inequality is maximally violated by a _ partially entangled _ state , not by any maximally entangled states , for two three - dimensional systems ( qutrits ) and further by mutually _ biased _",
    "measurements @xcite . on the other hand , the inequality of son _ et al .",
    "_ is maximally violated by a maximally entangled state , but still with mutually biased measurements .",
    "these features are `` counter - intuitive '' in the sense that there exists no nonlocality for neither entanglement nor unbiased measurements .",
    "they are also in contrast with the chsh inequality which is maximally violated for a maximally entangled state and mutually unbiased measurements .",
    "the generalized bell inequalities mentioned above were derived by assuming that each observer is allowed to choose one of two possible settings in the local measurement .",
    "one may extend the number of measurement settings , as done for qubits in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the counter - intuitive features of the generalized bell inequalities would be due to deficiency in the number of measurement settings , as @xmath3 mutually unbiased bases are possible for a prime or power - of - prime @xmath4-dimensional system .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a bell inequality for two qutrits that is maximally violated when a maximally entangled state and mutually unbiased measurements are employed . for the purpose",
    "we allow each observer to choose one of three measurement settings .",
    "in addition generalization of our bell inequality to prime - dimensional qudits is discussed .",
    "before presenting bell inequality for two qutrits , we briefly discuss the chsh inequality for two qubits @xcite as they have in common certain properties .",
    "suppose two parties , alice and bob , are separated in a long distance and observe two qubits distributed to them .",
    "alice and bob each have two sets of measuring apparatus .",
    "they each choose independently one of the two sets in their possession and perform a measurement with that set .",
    "we call the two variables , whose values are determined by the measurements using alice s ( bob s ) two sets of apparatus , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , respectively .",
    "we assign two possible values of @xmath9 to the outcome of the measurement on each variable .",
    "the chsh inequality is a constraint on correlations between alice s and bob s measurement outcomes if local realistic description is assumed .",
    "the bell function for chsh inequality is given as @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a collection of local hidden variables and the variables , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , take @xmath9 depending on the hidden variables @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "according to the local hidden variable theory , the statistical average of the bell function must satisfy the following inequality @xcite , @xmath14 where the statistical average @xmath15 with a probability density distribution @xmath16 .    taking a quantum - mechanical description ,",
    "the statistical average of the bell function is replaced by a quantum average of the corresponding operator @xcite .",
    "the bell operator , the counterpart to the classical bell function of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , is given as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are operators corresponding to the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "as measurement outcomes are assumed to be @xmath9 , each of the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 has eigenvalues @xmath9 .    a quantum expectation of the bell operator @xmath24 can be shown to violate the chsh inequality ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "let the operators be @xmath25 where @xmath26 are pauli operators .",
    "further let the two qubits be in a maximally entangled state , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a standard basis whose elements are eigenvectors of pauli operator @xmath29 .",
    "a straightforward algebraic calculation shows that the quantum expectation @xmath30 is @xmath31 and violates the constraint of the chsh inequality  ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "this implies that any local hidden variable theories can not simulate the quantum - mechanical correlation .",
    "for the two - qubit nonlocality , we would remark that a ) each observer randomly chooses one of _ two _ possible settings in measuring his / her qubit , b ) each measurement produces one of two possible outcomes @xmath32 , and c ) a quantum expectation can _ maximally _ violate the constraint , imposed by local realistic description , and reaches the quantum maximum @xmath33 if two conditions of a quantum state being maximally entangled and two local operators being mutually _ unbiased _ are satisfied @xcite .",
    "now we derive a three - setting bell inequality for two qutrits .",
    "our derivation is motivated by the fact that bell inequalities for high - dimensional systems , suggested in literatures , are _ maximally _ violated only when local operators are mutually _ biased _ and/or a quantum state is _ partially _ entangled , contrary to the chsh inequality for two qubits @xcite .",
    "alice and bob now have three sets of measuring apparatus each , from which they each choose one and perform a measurement .",

    "as discussed for the chsh inequality , the local realistic description implies that the values of the variables are predetermined by the local hidden variables @xmath11 : @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and a statistical average of their correlations is given as @xmath46 where @xmath16 is the probability density distribution over @xmath11 : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    to derive a constraint for the classical correlations ,",
    "consider the following bell function , @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the @xmath1-th power of @xmath20(@xmath21 ) .",
    "this bell function has notable features : first , it contains higher - order correlations , while the chsh inequality involves only the first - order correlations .",
    "in fact the second power of a dichotomic variable in the chsh inequality is meaningless as it is just unity . on the other hand , the variables contained in eq .",

    "suppose that two different elements in @xmath83-th row are both congruent to zero modulo @xmath84 : for @xmath85 , @xmath86 this is followed by @xmath87 then , the two elements in @xmath88-th row , @xmath89 and @xmath90 can not simultaneously be congruent to zero modulo 3 .",
