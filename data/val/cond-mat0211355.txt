    "superconductivity induced by mechanisms other than electron - phonon interactions has been of long - standing interest . throughout the last decade there has been continuing theoretical search for unconventional superconductivity mechanisms , particularly in two - dimensional systems .",
    "this interest has been , indeed , motivated by novel superconducting materials such as high-@xmath1 cuprates , organic superconductors as well as by the studies of @xmath2 films . currently , there is no full understanding of the physical processes responsible for the pairing in those systems .",
    "kohn - luttinger effect is one of the oldest as well as among the most appealing and elegant physical effects , which might be considered within this quest . back in 1965 ,",
    "kohn and luttinger @xcite showed that any three - dimensional electron system with repulsive interactions between particles was unstable against a superconducting transition at extremely low temperatures .",
    "the origin of the effect is that the screening of the bare interaction leads to the well - known friedel oscillations in the electron density and to similar oscillations in the scattering amplitude .",
    "the renormalized interaction acquires a long - ranged oscillatory component .",
    "thus , there appear some regions where the effective interaction is attractive .",
    "this leads to the formation of cooper pairs with non - zero orbital momenta @xmath3 .",
    "however , straightforward calculations showed that the transition temperature was extremely low ( the estimate of kohn and luttinger @xcite was @xmath4 for some realistic parameters of the fermion system ) .",
    "this extreme low value of @xmath1 was one of the reasons why the effect has not been much studied in recent years",
    ".    in the early nineties , kagan and collaborators obtained a number of interesting results within the kohn - luttinger theory @xcite ( such as cascade transitions , kohn - luttinger effect in a three dimensional system with long - ranged coulomb interaction , kohn - luttinger superconductivity in the hubbard model , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "one of the interesting results was that the temperature of the superconducting transition derived in the pioneering paper @xcite was shown to be underestimated due to the unjustified extrapolation in the expression valid for large orbital momenta down to the value @xmath5 .",
    "the transition temperatures calculated in ref .   were higher than the original estimate but still too low to attract much attention .",
    "one of the most natural issues to be explored has been the status of the kohn - luttinger theory in two dimensions .",
    "first of all , the kohn - luttinger physics is about the formation of bound states .",
    "it is very natural to expect that in the lower dimensionality it is easier to form bound states ( _ i.e. _ , cooper pairs ) .",
    "however , a simple calculation of the polarization operator leads to the disappointing result : no singularity exists in second - order perturbation theory .",
    "namely , the polarization operator reads ( we use units @xmath6 throughout the paper ) : @xmath7 , & \\mbox{if}\\,\\,\\,q > 2 k_{\\rm f } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the density of states at the fermi - line , @xmath9 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath10 is the momentum transfer in the cooper channel ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the scattering angle ) .",
    "let us remember that the attractive harmonics in the scattering amplitude in the three - dimensional case comes from the well - known logarithmic kohn s singularity @xmath13 which exists in 3d on both sides of the fermi - surface . as can be seen from eq.([p0 ] ) , the singularity in two dimensions is one - sided which suggests that no straightforward kohn - luttinger effect should exist in 2d .    in 1993",
    ", chubukov @xcite showed that this simple scenario was not the complete story in two dimensions . a two - sided singularity exists , but to find it one should go beyond second - order perturbation theory .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature derived by chubukov reads : @xmath14}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the dimensionless s - wave scattering amplitude . having applied this result to a realistic experiment on @xmath16 mixture films ,",
    "the numerical value was found as @xmath17 .",
    "let us also mention a recent paper of guinea _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in which the kohn - luttinger physics was phenomenologically incorporated in a model of high-@xmath1 cuprates",
    ". within this model the shape of the gap anisotropy has been explored as a function of doping .",
    "the main idea of the present paper is to search for an effective attractive interaction by taking into account the frequency dependence of the polarization operator , istead of going into higher order perturbation theory .",
    "the account for dynamical screening , as we shall see below , yields a two - sided singularity .",
    "thus , we are looking for a dynamical kohn - luttinger effect rather that the original static pairing problem as in refs . [ ] and [ ] . due to the energy dependence of the effective electron - electron coupling",
    ", the cooper problem turns into an integral equation , similar to the liashberg equation in the strong coupling theory of superconductivity . @xcite",
    "our paper is structured as follows : + in sec .",
    "ii , we rederive the expression for the polarization operator as a function of momentum @xmath10 and matsubara frequency @xmath18 . using this result",
    ", we formulate the cooper problem and derive the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation for the pairing vertex @xmath19 .    in sec .",
    "iii , we consider spherical harmonics of the effective interaction @xmath20 and show that d - harmonic , which corresponds to the orbital momentum @xmath21 , yields the strongest effective attraction .    in sec .",
    "iv , we use the explicit expression for the interaction in the @xmath0 channel and derive an integral equation for the pairing vertex . studying this equation ,",
    "we show that the pairing vertex may diverge if the incoming particles have high enough energies .",
    "we estimate the temperature at which the pairing with the typical binding energy of @xmath18 commences .",
    "we conclude that at low enough temperature the system is a mixture of low - lying electron excitations and fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "we estimate the temperature @xmath22 at which the effect of this fluctuaing pairs becomes essential and may strongly change transport and thermodynamic properties of the system .    in sec .",
    "v , we briefly discuss the case of long - ranged coulomb interactions .",
    "we argue that kohn - luttinger physics strongly depends on the screening properties . in a purely two - dimensional system",
    "we do not expect any superconducting instability to survive .",
    "if transport is two - dimensional but screening is three - dimensional , the system is qualitatively described by our theory and ref . [ ] .",
    "let us start with calculating the effective electron - electron interaction @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the bosonic matsubara frequency ) .",
    "in second - order perturbation theory there are four diagrams to be considered , which are shown in fig .",
    "1 . if the bare potential @xmath25 is short - ranged the diagrams `` b'',``c '' , and `` d '' cancel each other out and only `` e '' contributes to the renormalized interaction .",
    "the latter diagram is functionally identical to `` b '' but depends on @xmath26 rather then on @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "thus , knowing the two - dimensional polarization operator we readily obtain the total effective electron - electron coupling .",
    "the polarization operator is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the matsubara green function , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the fermionic matsubara frequency .",
    "after the sum over @xmath33 is evaluated , eq.([p1 ] ) takes on the form @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the fermi distribution . at not very high temperatures",
    "@xmath36 , it can be written as @xmath37 and after a straightforward calculation we obtain : @xmath38,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the complex variable @xmath39 for compactness : @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the fermi - velocity .",
    "one can easily check that eq.([p2 ] ) reproduces eq.([p0 ] ) if @xmath42 . to get the expression for the polarization operator @xmath43 as a function of the real frequency,@xcite one has to do the analytical continuation in eq.([pires ] ) .",
    "let us note here that only the real part of the polarization operator renormalizes the scattering amplitude .",
    "the imaginary part is not relevant to this renormalization .",
    "the latter quantity is proportional to the density of the electron - hole pairs .",
    "let us now formulate the cooper problem for the case under consideration .",
    "we are looking for a singularity in the cooper channel ( see the diagrammatic equation in fig .  2 ) .",
    "after averaging over the spin indices , the bethe - salpeter equation can be written as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are fermionic matsubara frequencies , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath50 is the renormalized interaction which depends on momentum and energy transfer .",
    "let us now consider only electrons in the very vicinity of the fermi surface so that @xmath51 , where @xmath12 is the scattering angle .",
    "following the standard route in the kohn - luttinger theory , we expand @xmath52 and @xmath53 in series of the normalized eigenfunctions of the angular momentum : @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 then , eq.([bs ] ) takes on the form : @xmath57 where as usual @xmath58 is the cooperon , which is the source of the bcs logarithm : @xmath59 let us note that eq.([bs2 ] ) is exact at any temperature .",
    "however , we shall consider only the case of low temperatures to avoid technical difficulties connected with the analytical continuation in eq.([bs2 ] ) . in the limit @xmath60 , the procedure of the analytical continuation reduces to the simple feynman rotation and all the matsubara sums involved",
    "may be replaced by the corresponding integrals with the temperature serving as a `` low - energy cut - off . ''",
    "the main result we are deriving in the present paper can be noticed in this limit as well .",
    "the next step is to evaluate the spherical harmonics of the renormalized interaction . at this point ,",
    "let us assume that the initial electron - electron interaction is defined only for the energies smaller than some threshold value @xmath61 , which will be serving as the high - energy cut - off ( just as the debye frequency in the classical weak - coupling bcs theory ) .",
    "in this case when performing actual calculations we can expand on @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63-harmonics of the polarization operator ( [ pires ] ) can be written as : @xmath64 keeping in mind that @xmath65 and evaluating the integral with the logarithmic accuracy , we obtain for even orbital momenta @xmath66 : @xmath67   \\biggr\\}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath68 @xmath69 \\biggr\\ } \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma - function and @xmath71 is the euler s constant .    from eqs.([peven],[podd ] ) we see that the dependence on the orbital momentum is very weak .",
    "the effective interaction can be written as @xmath72 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fourier - component of the bare interaction potential .",
    "if the initial interaction is @xmath10-independent , we see that the effective interaction is attractive only for the even values of the orbital momentum @xmath73 .",
    "the effective attraction is the strongest for @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-harmonics reads : @xcite @xmath74",
    "we can substitute result ( [ vd ] ) into the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs2 ] ) which turns into an integral equation ( at @xmath60 ) with a well defined kernel @xmath75 .",
    "one can easily see that if the incoming particles have zero energies , the cooper singularity gets canceled . however , at finite energies the cooper logarithm survives being cut - off by the energy transfer .    for further treatment ,",
    "let us define the following auxiliary dimensionless variables and functions : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79^{-1 } { \\cal t }   ( \\varepsilon ,   \\varepsilon'),\\ ] ] and @xmath80 in these notations , eq.([bs2 ] ) takes on the form @xmath81 the integral in ( [ bsformal ] ) is defined in such a way that the large-@xmath82 singularities are cut - off by @xmath83 and low-@xmath82 singularities at @xmath84 .",
    "it is hard to solve eq.([bsformal ] ) exactly .",
    "however , we are mostly interested not in the detailed solution but in the possibility of a singularity in the pairing vertex @xmath85 which would be a signal of a superconducting pairing ( but not necessarily a global superconducting instability ) .",
    "let us emphasize here that @xmath86 by the construction and it can not diverge simply because there is no attraction in this case , unless we take into account the higher order diagrams . at finite energy transfers ,",
    "the large cooper logarithm appears which yields a divergence of @xmath85 which we interpret as an appearance of fluctuating cooper pairs built up of the electronic excitations with finite energies .",
    "one of the ways to search for the singularity is to consider the eigenvalue problem for the kernel of integral equation ( [ bsformal ] ) : @xmath87 the singularity exists if there is a non - trivial solution of this equation .",
    "to get some qualitative estimates let us approximate the corresponding eigenvector by the following trial function : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are some weak ( logarithmic ) functions of @xmath91 . from eqs.([delta],[trial ] ) we can derive the self - consistency equation which yields the estimate for the threshold temperature at which the pairing with the typical energy transfer of @xmath18 commences:@xcite @xmath92 this estimate can be alternatively derived by considering the resolvent of the integral equation straightforwardly .",
    "namely , one can formally re - write eq.([bsformal ] ) as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the operator with the kernel in @xmath91-representation being equal to @xmath95 .",
    "the solution of this equation has can be formally written as : @xmath96^{-1}\\ , g_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the resolvent , which can be also written as : @xmath98 where @xmath99 can be found by evaluating the convolution of the corresponding kernels in the @xmath91-representation : @xmath100 studying the geometric series ( [ res ] ) , one can see that its @xmath101 s term contains the logarithm @xmath102 , with @xmath18 being the typical energy of the electrons in the cooper channel . summing up the series , we reproduce eq.([tp ] ) .    the integral equation ( [ bsformal ] ) and the corresponding eigenproblem ( [ delta ] ) are mathematically well - defined for any @xmath103 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath104 ) .",
    "however , it does not make too much sense to study the structure of the solutions at such energies in the framework of our formalism based on the matsubara technique .",
    "thus , result ( [ tp ] ) has the following domain of applicability : @xmath105 working in this domain , the replacement of the matsubara sums by the integrals is legitimate and our interpretation of @xmath106 as a real energy of a pair is valid as well .",
    "aslamazov - larkin contribution to the conductivity .",
    "small wavy lines correspond to the factor @xmath107 .",
    "shaded boxes are the pairing vertexes which in the case under consideration are functions of the four variables @xmath108.,width=144 ]    let us now briefly discuss how the appearance of the fluctuating pairs affects the physical properties of the system .",
    "the correction to the conductivity is described by the diagrams similar to the ones in the conventional fluctuation theory @xcite ( see _ e.g. _ fig .  3 where the aslamazov - larkin - like diagram is shown ) .",
    "it is a rather difficult problem to calculate the corresponding contributions in the case under consideration .",
    "however , we can get some qualitative insight by noting that the analytical continuation to the real frequencies in the expression for the conductivity contains the factor @xmath109 , which is basically the bose - distribution for the fluctuating cooper pairs ( the density of the cooper pairs ) .",
    "this factor and the corresponding correction are exponentially small unless there exist cooper pairs with @xmath110 . using eq.([tp ] ) , we can estimate the temperature @xmath22 at which such pairs appear .",
    "it is defined by the condition @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we readily obtain:@xcite @xmath112\\ , { 1 \\over \\left ( \\lambda \\nu \\right)^4 } \\right\\}}.\\ ] ] at this temperature , contribution to the conductivity due to the preformed cooper pairs may become comparable to the drude conductivity of a normal metal .",
    "until now , we have been studying a fermi - system with the bare electron - electron coupling being short - ranged . it is worth considering the case when the initial interaction is the long - range coulomb repulsion . in this case",
    "our treatment is not applicable since the momentum - dependence of the coulomb interaction becomes crucial .",
    "however , we can get some qualitative insight into the problem without cumbersome calculations .",
    "there are several possibilities one can consider :    first , we can study a system in which both transport and screening are two - dimensional . in this case",
    ", we can readily conclude that there is no possibility for kohn - luttinger pairing because the long - wavelength thomas - fermi screening is weak @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the effective 2d screening length and the thomas - fermi dielectric function has the standard long - wavelength form : @xmath115 we can now calculate the spherical harmonics of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath116 which are certainly all repulsive and remain repulsive even after friedel oscillations are taken into account ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "thus , even going beyond this long - wavelength thomas - fermi analysis we do not expect any pairing instability for the long - ranged coulomb interaction to appear , as long as both transport and screening are two - dimensional .",
    "however , the account for the dynamically screened coulomb interaction may lead to other important effects such as renormalization of the fermi - liquid parameters ( effective mass , @xmath117-factor , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "this issue is currently being investigated by the authors and the results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "second , one can consider a system in which transport is two - dimensional but screening is three - dimensional . in this case",
    "the coulomb interaction is well screened and decays exponentially at large distances @xmath118 ( @xmath0 is the screening length ) . in the limit @xmath119 ,",
    "the potential becomes effectively short ranged and , thus , the theory developed in the present paper is qualitatively valid .",
    "let us note that in this model the high - energy cut - off is basically the fermi energy which violates the assumption @xmath120 we used in our calculations .",
    "this , however , should not change main qualitative result of the paper .",
    "there is also an intermediate situation which may exist when the two - dimensional fermi - liquid lives in the very close vicinity of a metallic substrate . in this situation ,",
    "each two - dimensional electron produces an image in the metallic substrate so that the bare electron - electron interaction decays only as @xmath121 at large distances . in this case",
    ", there is no simple answer whether the kohn - luttinger pairing exists or not .",
    "presumably , the kohn - luttinger pairing in such a setup is possible if the fermi - liquid is dilute enough , so that friedel oscillations may compete with the initial dipole - dipole coupling .",
    "before concluding , we point out that earlier theoretical work in the literature has considered @xcite the possibility of bound states and cooper pairing in a dilute 2d system of fermions interacting via a short - ranged repulsive interaction .",
    "engelbrecht and randeria have considered a regular expansion in the @xmath122-matrix in two - dimensions analogous to the expansion on the dilute gas parameter @xmath123 in 3d.@xcite apart from the three - dimensional result , they have found an unusual pole in the particle - particle channel . although we do not find any obvious connection between our microscopic analysis and this earlier work , @xcite the claim of a new 2d collective mode interpreted as a bound excitation of two holes is somewhat reminiscent of our finding in this paper that kohn - luttinger type superconducting pairing is possible at finite excitation energies .",
    "whether there is a deep connection between our work and the earlier results @xcite remains unclear at this stage .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that a clean two - dimensional fermi - system with a short - range repulsive interaction between electrons becomes unstable against a formation of @xmath0-wave cooper pairs with a finite binding energy at a low enough temperature .",
    "thus , the low - temperature state of the system is a mixture of low - lying electron excitations and preformed fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "the new type of carriers may noticeably change the physical properties of the system such as conductivity , susceptibility , _ etc .",
    "_ at a temperature @xmath22 [ see eq.([t * ] ) ] .",
    "let us note that from our theory it follows that the fluctuating pairs appear within the normal state having a finite gap which is connected with the binding energy . note that there is no global superconductivity specifically predicted in our theory , only a pseudo - pairing at finite excitation energies .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper may be relevant to the pseudogap experiments in high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
