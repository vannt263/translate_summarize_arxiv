    "the realization of dipolar bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with large magnetic moments is an important step towards the opportunity for a more detailed study of the effects caused by the nonlinear , anisotropic , non - local , and long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , such as structured ground states @xcite , solitons @xcite , and roton - maxon spectra @xcite .",
    "dipolar condensates have recently been realized with atoms of @xmath1cr @xcite , @xmath0dy @xcite and @xmath2er @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there has been vast progress in the realization of a condensate with polar molecules with an electric dipole moment @xcite .",
    "two examples for the recent study of effects due to the ddi have been the experimental investigation of the collapse dynamics @xcite and the inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud @xcite of a dipolar @xmath1cr bec . in the former case",
    "the scattering length was ramped down below the collapse threshold and absorption images were made after the collapse and explosion of the condensate .",
    "the density distribution inherited the d - wave symmetry @xmath3 of the ddi . in the latter case",
    "the dipolar forces were shown to inhibit the inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud , which usually occurs during a time of flight .",
    "an exhaustive review of the physics of dipolar quantum gases has recently been given by lahaye _",
    "_ @xcite and baranov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the extended gross - pitaevskii equation to calculate the dynamics of a condensate , which yields an accurate description for sufficiently low temperatures and reads    @xmath4    with @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the number of particles , @xmath7 is the dipole length , and @xmath8 denotes the scattering length .",
    "the dipoles are aligned along the @xmath9-axis , such that @xmath10 is the angle between the @xmath9-axis and the vector @xmath11 .",
    "this form implies that all lengths are scaled in units of @xmath12 and all energies in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 control the strength of the scattering and the dipole interaction , respectively , and are assumed to be independently adjustable .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 is a measure for the importance of the dipole interaction .",
    "the strength of short - ranged interactions , which can be described by a fermi - like contact interaction , can be controlled by means of a feshbach - resonance @xcite .",
    "an external magnetic field changes the coupling between a bound state and a state of an incoming particle and allows for the control of the scattering length .",
    "this can be used to increase @xmath17 and therefore to enhance the dipolar character of the condensate .",
    "however , since feshbach - resonances reduce the lifetime of a condensate , one prefers the realization of condensates with larger magnetic moments .",
    "of all the above mentioned species with permanent magnetic dipole moments , @xmath0dy stands out with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the bohr magneton .",
    "our results can be scaled and are therefore valid for all dipolar systems .",
    "however , we are in particular interested in a condensate with @xmath0dy , which means that in the following all parameters are adjusted to fit the needs of a condensate with this species . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first fully numerical three - dimensional study for a realistic set of parameters close to those in actual experimental setups .",
    "we emphasize that our calculations do not depend on any further simplifications or restrictions beyond the use of a mean - field ansatz .    in the next section",
    "we give a short introduction to our numerical method and present our results with respect to expansion dynamics , structured ground states and a self - induced josephson junction .",
    "we solve the gross - pitaevskii equation numerically exact on a grid by means of the split - operator method using the imaginary- and real - time evolution .",
    "this yields a series of fourier transforms , which we evaluate with a highly parallelized algorithm using the cuda - architecture of nvidia . a more detailed overview is given in @xcite . for the calculation of stability and phase diagrams",
    "we start with a simple gaussian for a set of parameters far away from the stability border .",
    "this border is given by the maximum value ( in this paper either the angle of rotation @xmath20 or the number of particles @xmath6 ) for which the imaginary - time evolution converges and a stationary ground state exists .",
    "after the calculation of the ground state , we use this wave function as the initial wave function for the calculation of the next set of parameters , where we keep the aspect ratio or @xmath17 constant until we reach the stability border . since our computational ressources allow for a very small step size",
    ", we can make very precise predictions with respect to stability and phase diagrams .",
    "one possible setup for the experimental investigation of dipolar signatures in condensates is to tilt the polarization axis with respect to the external confinement by means of an external magnetic field and investigate its expansion dynamics .",
    "the influence of the ddi should manifest itself in a deviation of the expansion dynamics as compared to a condensate which is strongly dominated by isotropic short - ranged interactions .",
    "the most clear evidence would be a tof ( time of flight ) sequence in which the direction of the largest width of the cloud coincides with the polarization axis , regardless of the initial confinement . in this paper",
    "we study the equivalent scenario , where we rotate the external trap and the dipoles remain permanently aligned in @xmath9-direction .",
    "a tilt of the polarization axis clockwise in the @xmath21-plane corresponds to a rotation of the trap anti - clockwise along the @xmath22-direction .",
    "the corresponding transformation of the coordinates reads    @xmath23    fig .",
    "[ fig : expansion ] shows absorption images of three tof sequences with @xmath24 and different rotation angles @xmath20 . for absorption images in the @xmath22- and @xmath9-direction",
    "we integrate @xmath25 along the @xmath22- and @xmath9-axis , respectively .",
    "the first seqence at the top shows a tof for initial harmonic trapping with @xmath26 hz and @xmath27 , where we have used the trapping parameters from @xcite . since an anisotropic confinement yields an anisotropic momentum distribution",
    ", we see an inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud .",
    "the tof does not show any signature of the dipole - dipole interaction since the dynamics of the condensate is dominated almost entirely by the anisotropic momentum distribution .",
    "therefore in the middle panels we reduce the aspect ratio of the trap and adjust the confinement to @xmath28 hz and @xmath29 . for this setup",
    "the dynamics of the condensate is in stark contrast to the tof above since the expansion seems to be governed by the direction of the strongest initial confinement and the polarization axis .",
    "this can be cleary seen by the fact , that the direction of smallest width for 0 ms is not the direction which dominates the tof , as is the case for the sequence above .",
    "therefore this expansion dynamics strikes a balance between the direction that is given by the anisotropic momentum distribution and the polarization direction which is energetically preferable .",
    "the last tof shows absorption images in @xmath9-direction for @xmath26 hz and @xmath30 .",
    "here we see a blood - cell structured condensate where the density peak is away from the center @xcite , which occurs about 6 ms after the release from the trap ( for better visibility see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_absorption_image ] ) .",
    "note that the initial density distribution in the @xmath31-plane is given by a gaussian .",
    "therefore the structured state is not an artifact from the stationary ground state but rather a product of the expansion dynamics .",
    "the crucial parameter for the experimental oberservation of structured states is the visibility    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    with @xmath34 as the maximum value and @xmath35 as the value in the center of the plane .",
    "the visibility @xmath36 should be at least at about 0.1 to allow for a high - contrast imaging of the density distribution .",
    "it turns out that for all angles @xmath20 the visibility is smaller than this benchmark . for the smallest angle @xmath30",
    "we find @xmath37 , whereas for @xmath38 the corresponding visibility is @xmath39 .",
    "additionaly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_absorption_image ] , where we depict the quantities    @xmath40    the rotation of the external confinement destroys the rotational symmetry in the @xmath31-plane and leads to a saddle - shaped structured state .",
    "the small value of @xmath36 during the expansion dynamics suggests that such structured states can only be seen if modern imaging systems are further improved or systems with very large dipolar moments such as polar molecules are used .",
    "structured states are not only a feature of dynamical processes , but do occur as stationary ground states as well . in this section",
    "we investigate where in the parameter space these structured states occur and if their visibility is large enough to satisfy the above mentioned criterion of @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : stability_visibility ] depicts the stability border for four different values of @xmath17 and a phase diagram of the visibility of structured ground states for @xmath42 with respect to the angle of rotation @xmath20 and the aspect ratio of the trap @xmath43 with @xmath44 hz , and @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 particles .",
    "an increase of the angle of rotation or a reduction of the aspect ratio results in more dipoles in the attractive head - to - tail configuration , and thus destabilizes the condensate .",
    "these parameters are therefore crucial for the stability properties of a dipolar condensate and can be used to investigate its stability borders .",
    "experimentally one would prefer to change the axis of polarization as opposed to the aspect ratio of the trap since this axis can be easily controlled by an external magnetic field .",
    "as one would expect , smaller values of @xmath17 , which correspond to a condensate less dominated by the ddi , stabilize the condensate against larger angles of rotation and smaller aspect ratios .",
    "structured states can be found in the vicinity of the border of stability .",
    "here we find a broad strip in which @xmath47 . for low values of @xmath20 , these structures resemble the blood - cell - like structured condensates ( in the plane @xmath48 polarization axis ) which also occur during the tof ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : expansion ] ) .",
    "the spatial size of the structures is limited by the external confinement . here",
    "the diameter of the ring @xmath49 1 @xmath50 m .",
    "this should be sufficient for an experimental observation .",
    "one fascinating feature of dipolar condensates is the possibility of a self - induced josephson junction , where the effective potential consisting of the external confinement and the dipolar potential has the form of a double well .",
    "these systems show well known phenomena such as josephson oscillations or running phase modes @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we are again interested in stability borders , now with respect to the number of particles @xmath6 , the angle of rotation @xmath20 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the self - induced josephson junction can be realized by adding a toroidal potential to the external confinement .",
    "the external potential then reads    @xmath51    with @xmath52 ( 2.5 @xmath50k ) and @xmath53 ( 5 @xmath50 m ) . for @xmath30 the gaussian potential is in the @xmath31-plane and therefore perpendicular to the axis of polarization .",
    "this is the most stable configuration of the toroidal confinement since most of the dipoles are in the repulsive side - by - side configuration and arranged in a circle .",
    "if we rotate the trap until we attain @xmath54 , the axis of polarization and the gaussian potential will be in the same plane and we obtain the anisotropic density distribution which corresponds to a double - well potential .",
    "[ fig : stability_josephson ] depicts the stability diagrams with respect to the number of particles @xmath6 and @xmath17 as well as the angle of rotation @xmath20 and @xmath17 . for the first diagram we have chosen @xmath54 and @xmath55 hz and depict the stability diagram for four different values of @xmath56 .",
    "as can be seen , self - induced josephson junctions can not be realized with large numbers of @xmath0dy particles .",
    "but it is possible to increase the number of particles by reducing the harmonic confinement @xmath56 . this leads to more dipoles in the repulsive side - by - side configuration and thus stabilizes the condensate . a more effective way of stabilizing the condensate is to choose a smaller angle of rotation .",
    "for the stability diagram with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath17 we have chosen three different values for the number of particles and @xmath57 hz .",
    "we see again that reducing the number of particles stabilizes the condensate , and also that the reduction of @xmath20 allows for a greater amount of particles in the condensate .",
    "the calculation of stability diagrams allows for the search of new quantum states along the stability border of the self - induced josephson junction .",
    "indeed , we find a new stationary state whose density distribution corresponds to the macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) state known from double - well potentials @xcite , in which only one well is occupied .",
    "we find this state in a small strip along the stability border in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability_josephson ] a ) for @xmath58 . fig .",
    "[ fig : mqst ] depicts the one- and two - dimensional absorption images in @xmath59-direction of this state , where @xmath60 is calculated analogously to .",
    "this state is robust with respect to small experimental imperfections like small perturbations in the horizontality of the toroidal trap .",
    "indeed , the whole trap , as well as exclusively , the toroidal trap , may be rotated by several degrees without destroying this mqst - like state .",
    "further imperfections like gradients in the magnetic field may affect in which well the particles of the condensate accumulate , but we do not expect any further consequences due to the small magnitude of the gradient ( usually @xmath61 1 gauss / cm ) .",
    "nonetheless , the effect of small gradients upon the accumulation of the particles can be investigated by aligning the dipoles parallel to the @xmath22-axis .",
    "note that disturbances in general can result in a shift of the stability diagram , thus slightly changing the parameters where structured states are expected to appear .",
    "signatures of this mqst - like state can also be observed in the dynamics of josephson junctions , where a large initial imbalance in the occupation of the wells can not be periodically compensated and is therefore dominated by the self trapping in one well .",
    "this results in a running phase mode , where the creation of vortex - antivortex pairs in regions of small density is responsible for a phase shift @xcite .",
    "we have presented a series of stability and phase diagrams with respect to parameters which are of great importance for the experimental investigation of a dipolar bec .",
    "our results are valid for all dipolar systems , but we have adjusted all parameters to fit the needs of a condensate with @xmath0dy .",
    "we studied the expansion dynamics of a dipolar condensate and found two sorts of dipolar signatures occurring during tof sequences : the effects of the ddi are noticeable in that the width of the spatially expanding cloud is not only governed by the anisotropic momentum distribution but also by the direction of the polarization axis . in addition ,",
    "structured states occur during the tof .",
    "the analysis of stability diagrams shows that structured ground states can be found along the stability border and that their visibility is large enough for modern imaging systems .",
    "we have shown that the realization of a self - induced josephson junction with @xmath0dy is restricted to a rather small amount of particles . however ,",
    "this can be compensated by a rotation of the external confinement or the polarization axis .",
    "finally , the analysis of the stability diagram shows that large values of @xmath17 allow for a macroscopic quantum self - trapping state .",
    "further investigations should include the determination of the scattering length @xmath8 of @xmath0dy , which can be accomplished by a comparison of experimentally measured and theoretically calculated in - trap radii and stability diagrams .",
    "our results should therefore stimulate experimental efforts to study dipolar becs .",
