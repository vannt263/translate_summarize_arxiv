    "in the past decade , there has been a rising practical significance for ad - hoc wireless networks . starting with the emergence of sensor networks and the increased importance and distribution of local wireless networks like wifi networks , and now with the new paradigm of heterogeneous networks",
    ", there is an interest to understand ad - hoc networks even for the design of cellular networks .",
    "further , the expected future popularity of device networks under the umbrella of the internet of things ( iot ) is drawing attention to research in the area of ad - hoc wireless networks .    at the core of the wireless communication task , lies the problem of interference management , as the interference limitation stands as a bottleneck towards increasing the reliable rate of communication . while there has been tremendous effort over the past two decades to tackle the interference management problem from both theoretical and practical aspects , most of the results obtained can not apply directly to recent ad - hoc networks .",
    "traditional results on the interference management problem are either tailored for fixed infrastructural cellular networks or rely on distributed approaches where cell association and transmission schedule decisions are based on local knowledge of the network .",
    "most interference management solutions for ad - hoc networks rely on local knowledge to make distributed decisions",
    ". many advances in distributed transmission schemes have accompanied the rise of sensor networks in the past decade .",
    "the reason is that prior to the new technology of cloud computing , the common wisdom was that centralized solutions or relying on global network knowledge would not be feasible for networks that are not supported by fixed planned infrastructure .",
    "further , the nature of cellular networks prior to the novel paradigm of heterogeneous networks did not include any form of ad - hoc networks .",
    "now , with these two new advances : cloud computing and heterogeneous networks , a centralized approach for managing wireless transmission in ad - hoc networks is both more feasible and enjoys significant practical relevance ( see e.g. ,  @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "we attempt to tackle the problem of managing interference in ad - hoc networks in this work through studying the information - theoretic model of a linear interference network ( introduced by wyner in  @xcite ) with no channel state information available at the transmitters ( no csit ) .",
    "transmitters are only aware of the network topology in our model .",
    "further , to capture the benefit of the cloud we make two assumptions .",
    "first , global information about the network topology is available .",
    "second , each receiver is interested in one message that can be available at @xmath0 transmitters .",
    "the constraints on the number of transmitters that can be aware of each message relects a limited backhaul capacity constraint .",
    "assigning messages to transmitters in this model mirrors taking cell association decisions in a cellular heterogeneous network .",
    "further , the flexibility of being able to assign any message to any subset of @xmath0 transmitters reflects a cloud - based centralized controller that takes message assignment ( cell association ) as well as transmission schedule decisions .",
    "system models that share similarities with the considered model have been studied thoroughly in the literature . in particular , with the availability of channel state information at the transmitters , the problem of finding message assignments to transmitters that maximize the asymptotic per user degrees of freedom ( dof ) has been solved for linear interference networks in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in this work that combining centralized decisions for message assignment with cooperative transmission can achieve significant dof gains through a simple delay - free zero - forcing transmit beamforming scheme .",
    "the question we answer in this work with regard to this previous work is whether the same insight hold even with no csit .",
    "the problem of interference management with no csit , known as the topological interference management problem , has been studied with no cooperative transmission in  @xcite and@xcite . in  @xcite and  @xcite , this problem was considered for both constant channel and time - varying channel models , respectively . while the constant channel model assumes that the channel coefficients remain the same during a whole block of communication time slots , the time - varying channel model assumes a coherence time of unity , meaning that the channel changes from each time slot to the next .",
    "the results in these works show that dof conclusions as well as the design of optimal interference management schemes differ dramatically between these two channel models . in this work ,",
    "we show that enabling centralized decisions for assigning messages to transmitters allows us to reach the same conclusion for both time - varying and constant channel models , as long as the coherence time is the same for all communication links .",
    "recently , the problem of interference management through cooperative transmission has been studied with weak and no csit in  @xcite-@xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that assigning each message to all the transmitters connected to the desired receiver is beneficial compared to assigning each message only to the transmitter having the same index as the desired receiver .",
    "however , the proposed coding scheme in  @xcite relies solely on interference avoidance and no cooperative transmission is exploited . in our problem , we try to understand the effect of cooperative transmission by allowing for a flexible assignment of messages to transmitters even when each message can be available at exactly one transmitter .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that cooperative transmission does not increase the per user degrees of freedom in large linear interference networks .",
    "we reach this conclusion by proving an information theoretic converse for the case when each message can be available at more than one transmitter , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "we prove that the asymptotic per user dof for any @xmath1 is the same as the one for the case when @xmath2 , which is achieved by interference avoidance .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : problem ] , we introduce the problem formulation . the main result is stated in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "we present the interference avoidance scheme for the case when @xmath2 in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "we then prove the information theoretic upper bound for the case when @xmath3 in section  [ sec : converse ] . before concluding , we discuss an extension of our problem to arbitrary network topologies in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "however , one can use a different argument for this network : all receivers in a fully connected network observe a linear combination of all transmit signals , but the coefficients of these linear combinations vary because of the different channel coefficients .",
    "however , since we are assuming that the channel coefficients are not known at transmitters and each is drawn independently from the same distribution , the following holds .",

    "we just provide this example to stimulate thinking about solving the problem for general network topologies .",
    "[ sec : identical ] while we have not made an assumption on the coherence time of the channel in section  [ sec : model ] , we have assumed that all channel coefficients are drawn from the same distribution .",
