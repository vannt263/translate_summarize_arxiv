    "the nonlinear regime of mesoscopic transport is unique because certain physical effects have no counterparts at linear response .",
    "a prominent example is the breakdown of the onsager - casimir relations that manifests itself in the differential conductance out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the effect is due to asymmetric properties of electron - electron interactions under reversal of an external magnetic field and has been extensively studied in the last decade both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "these results are relevant to characterize nonlinear rectification phenomena in ballistic conductors  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , all these works deal with purely electric transport .",
    "equally interesting is the investigation of magnetic - field asymmetries of _ thermoelectric and heat _ rectification transport .",
    "that is the goal we want to accomplish in this work .",
    "it is important to distinguish between magnetic - field asymmetries occurring in the linear and the nonlinear regime of transport . for two - terminal conductors coupled to equilibrium environments ,",
    "the linear conductance is always an even function of the magnetic field @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "however , under the same conditions the linear thermoelectric coefficient can exhibit @xmath0 asymmetries if carriers experience inelastic scattering inside the conductor  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the two - terminal thermopower need not be an even function of @xmath0 and its degree of asymmetry determines the thermodynamic efficiency of a system with broken time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries we discuss here survive in the purely elastic case and appear only in the nonlinear regime of transport .    a recent experiment by j. matthews _ et al .",
    "@xcite has detected an asymmetry of the seebeck coefficients in a multiterminal cross junction when the applied thermal gradient exceeds the linear response limit .",
    "intriguingly , the asymmetry depends on the measurement configuration .",
    "we consider below general expressions for the thermopower magnetoasymmetry and illustrate our method with an explicit calculation of a model system .",
    "we find that , quite generally , the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the nonlinear thermopower are different depending on the specific way that the generated voltage is measured in response to the applied thermal difference .",
    "our analysis is based on a scattering theory valid for nonlinear thermoelectric transport  @xcite .",
    "this approach considers leading - order contributions to the sample screening potential arising not only from an external dc bias  @xcite but also from applied temperature shifts  @xcite .",
    "thus , our self - consistent treatment takes into account charge injectivity  @xcite and entropic injectivity  @xcite contributions to the charge accumulation that builds up in the conductor out of equilibrium .",
    "recently , the scattering approach has been successfully applied to discuss thermodynamic efficiencies and figures of merit beyond linear response  @xcite .",

    "heat rectification ( a nonlinear heat flow in response to a temperature difference  @xcite ) has been investigated in carbon nanotubes  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite , just to mention a few .",
    "therefore , we naturally extend our analysis of magnetic - field asymmetries to the nonlinear heat transport coefficients .",
    "we show below that the leading - order heat rectification is @xmath0-asymmetric when the entropic injectivity is not invariant under reversals of the magnetic field .",

    "@xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite , the general expressions for all linear and leading order nonlinear coefficients are derived . in order to make this article self - contained , we write out those coefficients in  [ appena ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the linear response coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are evaluated at equilibrium and consequently are independent of the screening potential @xmath10 , while the weakly nonlinear coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 do depend on @xmath10 in response to the applied electrical and thermal biases .    in a situation",

    "the bare charge @xmath46 injected from lead @xmath15 is due both to a voltage imbalance and to a temperature shift in lead @xmath15 ; each contribution is respectively described by the particle injectivity  @xcite @xmath47 $ ] and the entropic injectivity  @xcite @xmath48 $ ] summing up to give @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "the screening charge @xmath51 builds up inside the conductor due to interaction with the injected charges , which we obtain from the response of the internal potential , @xmath52 , away from the equilibrium state @xmath53 .",

    "then , the net charge response of the system reads @xmath58 and the set of equations for the cps is closed when we relate this out - of - equilibrium net charge with @xmath59 via the poisson equation , @xmath60 .",
    "importantly , the self - consistent procedure discussed here is also applicable to inhomogeneous fields , i.e. , when the potential @xmath10 is position - dependent , as will be shown below when we apply our general model to a specific system .    in order to quantify the aforementioned magnetic - field asymmetry in the nonlinear transport regime",

    "thus , a deviation from 1 of these symmetry and asymmetry parameters is indeed an indication of the magnetic - field symmetry breaking in the nonlinear regime . in a recent experiment by j. matthews _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the authors tested the magnetic - field asymmetry for the thermoelectric coefficient , i.e. , @xmath70 [ eq .  ] , for which they defined a parameter quite analogous to @xmath79 used here to analyze the measured data , except they averaged the coefficient over the magnetic fields .",
    "it was shown that sufficiently strong thermal gradients may lead to magnetic - field asymmetries and that these asymmetries qualitatively differ between the diagonal ( @xmath80 ) and the off - diagonal [ @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) ] elements .",

    "the advantage of using the asymmetry parameters is that they provide pure measures of the magnetic - field asymmetry once they deviate from 1 .",

    "thus , the nonunity of @xmath95 is purely due to the magnetic - field asymmetry @xmath96 whereas @xmath97 does not guarantee the field asymmetry but indicates the importance of nonlinear effects , a part of which is the magnetic - field asymmetry . as shown in this example , to leading order in the external fields ,",
    "the symmetry parameter @xmath61 consists of the symmetric ( even ) combination between the nonlinear coefficients [ @xmath98 and @xmath99 in this case ] while the asymmetry parameter @xmath62 is comprised of the asymmetric ( odd ) combination , explaining the terminologies .",

    "but we emphasize that the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 which we use here are dimensionless quantities and have direct relevance to the experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these parameters are related to the efficiency of the thermoelectric power generation or the refrigeration  @xcite .",
    "thus , the gate - tunability of these parameters , which we demonstrate below for a quantum hall conductor , can pave the way for controlling the functionality of thermoelectric devices .",
    "armed with the general formalism described so far , we are now ready to apply it to a specific system ; a conductor in the quantum hall regime coupled to two terminals , as depicted in figure  [ fig : sys ] .",
    "we fix the external magnetic field @xmath0 such that only the lowest landau level is occupied ( filling factor 1 ) . hereafter , the magnetic field strength is constant and we only consider the reversal of its direction denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath108 .",
    "an antidot is formed inside the quantum hall bar by producing a potential hill with a gate control  @xcite , which can connect two counter - propagating edge states .",
    "we regard the antidot as a quantum impurity with a breit - wigner resonance at @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the interaction - driven potential shift at the antidot in the presence of magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the upper and the lower edge states are tunnel - coupled to the antidot via hybridization widths @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "suppose that the direction of the magnetic field is reversed .",
    "it follows that the direction of charge flows through the edge states is also reversed due to the chiral nature of the quantum hall system , and the resonant level at the antidot in this case forms at @xmath113 .",
    "it should be noted that the potential shift @xmath114 is in general magnetic - field asymmetric , i.e. , @xmath115 , once the screening effects are incorporated beyond the linear response regime  @xcite .",
    "this system serves a good test bed for the magnetic - field asymmetry as the symmetry can be broken either through the scattering asymmetry , @xmath116 , or through the electrical asymmetry provided the charges on the upper edge interact more strongly with the antidot than those on the lower edge .    , @xmath117 and temperature shifts @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",

    "the region - specific cps are then given by @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and the net charge response in eq .",
