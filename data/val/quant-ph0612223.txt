    "correlation effect plays an important role in physical phenomena . many interesting properties of the quantum systems are attributed to the existence of the entanglement @xcite , which is intrinsically related to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics and the direct product structure of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "entanglement is a kind of pure quantum correlation which does not exist in any classical systems , and regarded as a significant resource in quantum information processing , such as quantum teleportation , dense coding , and quantum cryptography @xcite .    due to the central role of the entanglement in quantum information , various issues on the entanglement",
    "have been studied intensively in recent fifteen years . among these issue , the effects of environmental parameters ( such as thermal fluctuation and external field ) to the entanglement in quantum spin systems have been attracted much attention @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some interesting properties of the entanglement which is beyond the traditional physical intuition were found . for examples ,",
    "the thermal fluctuation can enhance the entanglement in some special cases , the external field does not always suppress the entanglement @xcite .",
    "therefore , these studies shed new light on our understanding of the entanglement",
    ".    however , besides the quantum entanglement , a quantum system possesses the classical correlation @xcite .",
    "a simple example is the spin singlet state @xmath0 , besides the entanglement with value 1 , the state also has the classical correlation of the value 1 ( see section ii ) .",
    "another example is the mixed state with the density matrix as @xmath1 . in this state ,",
    "the quantum correlation between two spins is zero , while the classical correlation is 1 .",
    "therefore , some interesting questions arise . for examples ,",
    "what is the difference between the classical correlation and quantum correlation in a realistic system ? is the classical correlation always larger than the quantum one ?",
    "why we live in a classical world rather than a quantum world ? etc .. answering these questions from the point of view of different correlations are our main motivations in this work .    our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : definition ] , we define the measurements of total , quantum and classical correlations . in section",
    "[ sec : enviroment ] , we use a heisenberg dimer which interacts with the thermal environment as an example to study the effects of the temperature , external fields , and anisotropic interaction on the the correlations .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "in quantum information theory @xcite , for two subsystems 1 and 2 , the mutual information is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the entropy of the corresponding reduced density matrix . since the entropy is used to quantify the physical resource ( in unit of classical bit due to @xmath4 in its expression ) needed to store information of a system ,",
    "the mutual entropy then measures additional physical resource required if we store two subsystems respectively rather than store them together .",
    "let us look at a very simple example : a two - qubit system in a singlet state @xmath0 .",
    "we have @xmath5 and @xmath6 , hence @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , there is no information in a given singlet state .",
    "however , each spin in this state is completely uncertain .",
    "so we need two bits to store them respectively . here",
    "the mutual information is twice the entanglement , as measured by the von neumann entropy of either subsystem .",
    "this is due to the reason that besides quantum correlation , the state has also classical correlation between the two subsystems .",
    "therefore , the mutual information can be used to measure the total correlation between two subsystems . we will call the quanity @xmath8 as the `` total correlation entropy '' or simply `` total correlation '' hereafter .",
    "the quantum correlation only exists in the quantum world , and usually is called entanglement . for bipartite state , there are a few measures to quantify the entanglement of a general mixed state @xcite . among the measures ,",
    "the entanglement of formation @xcite is well known and a analytic formula for two - qubit system is found @xcite . consider a density matrix @xmath9 of two subsystems 1 and 2 .",
    "there are infinite pure - state ensembles @xmath10 of @xmath9 , where @xmath11 is the probability of @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 for each pure state @xmath14 , the entanglement @xmath15 is measured by the von neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "then the entanglement of formation @xmath16 of the density matrix @xmath9 is the average entanglement of the pure states of the decomposition , minimized over all the possible ensembles : @xmath17 ( note that if the system is in a pure state , @xmath16 is just @xmath15 . ) for a mixed state , it is usually difficult to evaluate @xmath16 .",
    "however , for a two - qubit system , it can be readily obtained from the concurrence of the system . given the density matrix @xmath9 of the pair qubits ,",
    "the concurrence is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the normal pauli operators , and @xmath23 is the complex conjugate operator of @xmath9 .",
    "the entanglement of formation can then be evaluated as @xcite @xmath24 @xmath16 is monotonically increasing and ranges from 0 to 1 as @xmath25 goes from 0 to 1 .",
    "@xmath26 if the system is unentangled and @xmath27 if it is maximally entangled . in fact , one can take the concurrence itself as a measurement of entanglement .",
    "since the mutual information has the unit of bit , for comparison purpose , we will take the entanglement of formation instead of concurrence to be our measurement standard in this paper .",
    "we will call the quantity @xmath16 as the `` quantum correlation entropy '' or simply `` quantum correlation '' hereafter",
    ".      the classical correlation of a bipartite system is defined in different scenarios @xcite .",
    "the measure defined in @xcite reflects the effect of one party s measurement on the other party s state .",
    "the measure defined in @xcite attempts to explain the total correlation coming from quantum part and classical part based on the distance concept of relative entropy .",
    "both these two measure coincides in the case of pure states . consider a pure state of bipartite system , @xmath28 unpon schmidt decomposition .",
    "the quantum correlation actually defines the amount of immediate effect on one subsystem during the performing measurement on another subsystem . for pure state",
    ", it is just the entropy of one subsystem .",
    "after the measurement , the density matrix becomes diagonal in the basis of the schmidt decomposition .",
    "then the classical correlation between these two subsystems corresponds to the maximum amount of change of uncertainty in one subsystem after knowing some new information of another subsystem through a classical channel .",
    "such a correlation equals to the entropy of one subsystems too . for the mixed state",
    ", the total correlation can not neatly divided into the quantum part and the classical part .",
    "these two parts are much more  entangled \" with each other .    in this paper , we follow the lines of @xcite .",
    "that is , roughly speaking , the total correlation comes from the quantum part and the classical one . intuitively , the quantum correlation is more flimsy than the classical one , and the classical correlation should be larger than the quantum correlation in the mixed state .",
    "an obvious instance is that for the separable state , there is no entanglement while classical correlation exists , in which case all the total correlation comes from the classical part .",
    "is it possible that the quantum correlation is larger than the classical part ?",
    "for this purpose , we would like to adopt the quantum entanglement measure as large as possible .",
    "it is proved that all the reasonable entanglement measures is not larger than the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "so , we take the entanglement of formation as the quantum correlation and the classical correlation is defined as the total correlation minus the quantum part . before we discuss the main result , we argue that the total correlation minus the entanglement of formation is the non - erasable correlation under the constraint that entanglement is preserved . recall that the entanglement of formation is originally proposed to describe the process of preparation of an entangled state under local operation and classical communication ( locc ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ef ] ) , we can see that the entanglement of formation corresponds to a specified decomposition of the density matrix . in experiment , to have a given decomposition , one of experimentalists , say alice , prepares the states @xmath29 according the probability distribution @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the actual state that describe the initial state of the preparation process is @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the flags , a set of orthogonal basis for alice to distinguish @xmath33 . after compression , alice",
    "send the subsystem through an ideal quantum channel to the another experimentalist bob who need to know which one he receives because in general he can not decompress the state without destroying the entanglement of the state .",
    "he requires the information to distinguish @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the flags state are also needed to be sent though this task does not require an ideal quantum channel .",
    "a classical channel is enough . in order to obtain the goal state @xmath9 from the prepared state @xmath34 ,",
    "both alice and bob are required to erase the flag memory which is used to store the information of the set of orthogonal basis .",
    "this procedure decreases the classical correlation but preserves the entanglement of formation .",
    "however any more information can not be erased further or entanglement will be destroyed .",
    "therefore , the remaining part of the correlation represents the non - erasable classical correlation between two subsystems @xmath9 under the preservation of quantum correlation , and is calculated by @xmath35    in short , we argue that the mutual information is taken as the total correlation , the entanglement of formation is taken as the quantum correlation , and difference of them is the classical correlation in the meaning of non - erasable classical correlation .",
    "especially for an arbitrary two - qubit system , the total , quantum and classical correlations can be easily calculated and we can compare the quantum correlation and the classical one quantitatively .",
    "in this section , we use the heisenberg dimer as a prototype model to show the interesting behavior of the total , quantum and classical correlations under different environment .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + b_1\\sigma_1^z+b_2\\sigma_2^z , \\label{eq : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the pauli matrices , @xmath39 is the strength of heisenberg interaction , and @xmath40 are the external magnetic fields . for simplicity ,",

    "first , at high temperature , all correlations approach zero .",
    "this is because that the occupation probabilities of the unentangled states will be enhanced and the correlations will be diluted .",
    "the thermal fluctuation is the leading effects .",
    "second , at certain temperature range , the classical correlation exceeds the quantum correlation .",
    "this is obvious in cases of small @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropic](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "third , when @xmath41 is close to 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropic](c ) ) , the classical correlation may exhibit a local minimum at low temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that the quantum correlation is smaller for a larger @xmath41 .",
    "the physical interpretation is that a larger @xmath41 corresponds to a more classical model , hence less amount of entanglement .",
    "when @xmath41 reaches 1 , the quantum correlation vanishes for all temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropic](d ) ) .",
    "this is expected because when @xmath56 all eigenstates of the hamiltonian are unentangled states , hence the resulting density matrix @xmath57 is separable for all temperature .",

    "the classical correlation , whose value is equal to the quantum one for a pure state , is also zero . the thermal fluctuation , as can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : xy_1 ] ( c and d ) , increases both the quantum and classical correlations at low temperatures . moreover , an interesting observation is that there exists a range where the quantum correlation exceeds the classical one . in addition , the larger the external field , the smaller the quantum correlation .",
    "it is because a large - field setting corresponds to a more classical model",
    ". it may be interesting to note that the threshold temperature of the quantum correlation is independent of the field @xcite .",
    "all three correlations approach or equal zero at high temperatures .",

    "the main difference is that the a larger @xmath82 here may leads to a higher threshold temperature @xmath59 . in order to see the role of the nonuniform field ,",
    "we show three correlations against fields at some fixed temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy_3 ] ( the results of quantum correlation , which have already been obtained by sun _ etal _",
    "@xcite , are also presented for comparison ) . at low temperature",
    ", we notice that the three correlations are sharply peaked at zero fields .",
    "they decay rapidly with the increasing fields if the fields have the same direction , while decay comparatively slowly if the fields have opposite directions .",
    "this means that the correlation effects can be adjusted by the uniform fields . at some higher temperature ,",
    "the peak of the quantum correlation splits into two in the region @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xy_3](b ) ) . therefore , the nonuniform fields may enhance the quantum correlation , while the uniform fields always destructs it .",
    "at very high temperature , the peaks are completely separated as shown in fig .",

    "a region with zero quantum correlation appears between the peaks .",
    "this implies that the nonuniform field can be used as a switch to turn on and off the quantum correlation @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , unlike the quantum correlation , the classical correlation always decreases with the increasing external magnetic fields . which means that the external magnetic fields have different effects to the quantum correlation and to the classical correlation .",
    "in this paper , we provide quantification of the total , quantum and classical correlations in a general bipartite system . in order to see their properties in a realistic system , we study them in an anisotropic heisenberg model at finite temperatures .",
    "we find that the quantum correlation always decreases with the increasing temperature , while the classical one may increase in some temperature range .",
