    "although the standard model ( sm ) is the simplest model that succesfully explain most of the phenomena and experimental observations in particle physics , it contains unanswered fundamental questions which many theorists associate to an underlying unified theory beyond the sm .",
    "for example , in the framework of the sm the enormous differences in the scale of masses exhibited among the elementary fermions is unnatural and unpredictable .",
    "this question can be addressed in family dependent models where a symmetry distinguish fermions of different families .",
    "an interesting alternative that may provide a clue to this puzzle are the models with gauge symmetry @xmath2 , also called 3 - 3 - 1 models , which introduce a family non - universal @xmath3 symmetry @xcite .",
    "these models have a number of phenomenological advantages .",
    "first of all , from the cancellation of chiral anomalies @xcite and asymptotic freedom in qcd , the 3 - 3 - 1 models can explain why there are three fermion families .",
    "secondly , since the third family is treated under a different representation , the large mass difference between the heaviest quark family and the two lighter ones may be understood @xcite .",
    "third , the models have a scalar content similar to the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which allow to predict the quantization of electric charge and the vectorial character of the electromagnetic interactions @xcite . also , these models contain a natural peccei - quinn symmetry , necessary to solve the strong - cp problem @xcite .",
    "finally , the model introduces new types of matter relevant to the next generation of colliders at the tev energy scales , which do not spoil the low energy limits at the electroweak scale .",
    "although the 3 - 3 - 1 models introduce a family non - universal property , it is exhibited only for the quark sector between the heaviest family and the remaining two lighter .",
    "thus , the model does not reproduce well the hierarchical strutures of the quark / lepton mass matrices .",
    "in addition , none of the current non - supersymetrical 3 - 3 - 1 models can be considered as an unification model at the planck scale but a model at an intermediate scale of energy .",
    "an alternative to connect 3 - 3 - 1 models with unification theories is to embed them into bigger gauge structures and to generate an appropriate spontaneuos symmetry breaking mechanism . although there are some attempts to achieve this with 3 - 3 - 1 models , there arise problems that either spoils some of the good features of the model or it simply does not improve the predictive power of the model .",
    "thus , for example , some authors have considered 3 - 3 - 1 models as a subgroup of an @xmath4 model @xcite and @xmath5 groups @xcite , which is possible only for the unrealistic case of one family .",
    "other authors have proposed to embed 3 - 3 - 1 models into the pati - salam @xmath6 model @xcite , which exhibit mass matrices analogous to the 3 - 3 - 1 case and without the unification of the interactions .",
    "there are other extensions inspired in the 3 - 3 - 1 models as for example @xmath7 models @xcite , which basically exhibit the same features as the 3 - 3 - 1 case , without neither explaining the hierarchical pattern of the mass structures nor to achive an unification of the interactions .",
    "on the other hand , there is another mechanism to generate hierarchical pattern of the fermion masses without a flavor symmetry , based in the old idea that in a three - family grand unified gauge model , each family transform differently under the unified group , producing a nontrivial flavor structure @xcite .",
    "the combination of this scheme with that where the masses of light fermions may arise out of radiative corrections whereas the heavy fermions obtain tree - level masses @xcite , leads to realistic texture structures for the quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "recently , these schemes have been reviewed and new ideas have been introduced by authors in @xcite in the context of so(10)- and su(n)-based models , and in @xcite for su(9 ) models .",
    "for example , in su(n ) models the way mass hierarchy emerges is characteristic of doubly lopsided models originally proposed in the framework of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "although the above works show that it is possible to obtain predictive flavor structures without flavor symmetry in a grand unification scheme , and applications to specific models have been described , the constructions and analyses have been done in a qualitative level , where general assumptions on the particle content and on the scheme of the breaking symmetry are considered . we intend to explore in a quantitative level these methods within a unified model with a specific particle content and breaking symmetry sequence .",
    "in contrast with the previous works where the su(5 ) `` language '' is used to descompose the irreducible representations of su(8 ) , we use a 3 - 3 - 1 language to identify particles within su(8 ) representations . in this paper",
    "we emphasize in the theoretical construction of the model , where we describe how to embed 3 - 3 - 1 into su(8 ) and a complete particle assignation into irreducible representations ( irreps ) of su(8 ) is obtained .",
    "we show that it is possible to construct a 3 - 3 - 1 model for three families that can be unified into a single unified group , and symmetry - breaking pattern from su(8 ) down to 3 - 3 - 1 may be generated .",
    "detailed numerical and phenomenological analyses including studies on the renormalization group equations , construction of higgs potential , one - loop calculations , etc . is intended to be done in future works .",
    "however , in order to illustrate the way mass hierarchy emerges from this model , one - loop diagrams for the up - quark sector are constructed and taking only dominant constributions , we estimate the hierarchical ratios among their masses . in sec .",
    "2 we show all the group structure and representations of su(8 ) , and from appropriate branching rules we generate decompositions of representations down to 3 - 3 - 1 . we obtain a complete three - family fermion 3 - 3 - 1 spectrum . in sec .",
    "3 we exhibit the complete su(8 ) particle content of the model .",
    "4 and 5 are devoted to the discussion of the fermion mass generation . in 4",
    "we show the most general yukawa terms that induce tree - level matrix masses , while in 5 we obtain an approximation of one - loop mass calculations for the up - type quark sector .",
    "we requiere that the unified group su(8 ) contains an @xmath8 with @xmath9 the color charge of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and @xmath10 the flavor sector of the electroweak interactions to be identified with the @xmath11 group .",
