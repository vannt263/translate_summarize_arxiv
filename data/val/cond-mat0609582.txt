    "random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) is an attractive model for a number of physical phenomena , including such different application as information processing @xcite and particle branching in impact ionization @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of rsa is the car parking problem ( cpp ) .",
    "of interest is the average number of particles ( `` cars '' ) adsorbed on a long line , as well as the variance of this number ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the review ) . in what follows",
    ", we shall use the term _ standard rsa _ for the classical 1-dimensional model corresponding to particles of fixed size that arrive randomly on a line and are deposited if empty space is available and rejected otherwise .",
    "extensions of this model include rsa with particles expanding in the adsorption process @xcite , two - size particle adsorption @xcite , and also rsa with an arbitrary particle - size distribution function @xcite .",
    "few of these models , especially physically relevant ones , have an exact solution . as a rule",
    ", only the fill factor is determined . however , for a number of applications fluctuations are of major importance .",
    "an example of such an application is the very important practical problem of particle energy branching ( peb ) where high - energy particle propagates in an absorbing medium and multiplies producing secondary electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs .",
    "the energy distribution of secondary particles is random to a good approximation .",
    "multiplication proceeds so long as the particle energy is above the impact ionization threshold @xcite .",
    "this connection was noticed as early as in 1965 by w. van roosbroek @xcite .",
    "the extension of rsa model proposed in @xcite , known as the `` crazy carpenter model '' was further exploited in @xcite .",
    "the peb process can be considered in terms of a cpp if one identifies the initial particle kinetic energy with an available parking length and the pair creation energy as the car size .",
    "full equivalence to cpp requires further that only one of the secondary particles takes on significant energy , otherwise one has to consider simultaneous random parking of two cars in one event @xcite .",
    "the number of created electron - hole pairs @xmath0 in peb serves to evaluate the initial energy .",
    "variance of this number limits the accuracy of energy measurements .",
    "both the yield @xmath1 and the e - h pair variance @xmath2 are proportional to initial energy .",
    "the ratio of the e - h pair variance to the yield is called the fano factor @xcite . the fano factor",
    "@xmath3 ( for a poisson - distributed @xmath0 one has @xmath4 ) is a parameter that quantifies the energy resolution of high - energy particle detectors . for semiconductor crystals ,",
    "the peb problem has many additional complications due to phonon losses , as well as features in energy dependencies of the particle density of states and the impact ionization matrix element .",
    "earlier attempts to evaluate the fano factor for the peb problem in semiconductors employed widely different approaches ( compare @xcite and @xcite ) . to obtain agreement with the experimentally observed @xmath5 ( for semiconductors ) ,",
    "different fairly rude and unjustified assumptions were made , so that the numerical coincidence is of little value .",
    "also available are numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "however , the relative importance of various factors ( e.g. phonon contribution to @xmath3 ) remains questionable within the numerical models , while the precision of results is difficult to assess .",
    "evaluation of the fano factor is important for predicting the energy resolution of detectors , especially those based on new materials and new principles @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the impact ionization process is the fact that the threshold impact ionization energy is usually larger than the minimum energy @xmath6 needed for e - h pair creation .",
    "this difference arises from kinematic restrictions imposed by momentum conservation , so that , e.g. , for equal effective masses of electrons and holes the minimal energy of pair production is @xmath7 . in crystals with",
    "non - equal electron and hole masses the threshold can vary from @xmath6 to @xmath8 . in terms of the rsa problem",
    "this is equivalent to the particle shrinking immediately after the adsorption ( parking ) , making larger available length for the next adsorption event .    for the peb problem",
    "only particle shrinking is pertinent .",
    "however , for a general rsa problem both the shrinking and the expansion of particles are relevant , due to such factors as , e.g. , repulsion between particles and surface attraction .    in this paper",
    ", we use a recursive approach to consider the general rsa problem for particles that either shrink or expand immediately upon adsorption .",
    "we present an analytical solution for both the average filling factor and its variance .",
    "the results are compared with approximate solutions obtained by the methods employed in earlier approaches to the energy branching problem @xcite and , for expanding particles , also with the results of a kinetic approach used in ref .",
    "exact solutions presented here allow to assess the errors introduced by the adopted approximations in the evaluation of both the yield and the variance .",
    "in this section we develop an analytical model of adsorption for shrinking or expanding particles . we shall be using the recursive technique @xcite . besides being the most direct approach",
    ", this technique has the further advantage of being applicable for the evaluation of both the average filling factor and the variance .",
    "the recursive approach has been confirmed by direct monte - carlo computer simulations@xcite for similar problems .",
    "consider adsorption of a particle on an initially empty line of progressively growing length @xmath9 .",
    "the final ( after shrinking or expansion ) size of the adsorbed particle is taken equal unity .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the random variable corresponding to the total wasted length for some configuration of adsorbed particles in the _ jamming limit _",

    "equations for the expected values of the moments of waste distribution can be obtained using moment generation function , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "moments of @xmath10 are obtained by differentiating @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "when a particle is adsorbed into gap @xmath9 , two new gaps appear , the size of the gaps being @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "equivalent equations can be derived for the mean filled length @xmath21 , which for a unit particle size equals the number of particles adsorbed on the line of length @xmath9 .",

    "is to consider a kinetic ( or rate ) equation that describes the sequential deposition of particles . in the kinetic approach",
    "the gap size distribution function @xmath26 representing the average density of voids of the length between @xmath9 and @xmath27 at a time @xmath28 obeys the equation @xcite = - g(x , t)_0^x ds p(s ) _ 0^x - sdy f(y , x - y - s|s ) + + 2 _ x^dy g(y , t ) _ 0^y - x ds p(s ) f(x , y - x - s|s ) .",

    "one can see that for a fixed @xmath31 the rate @xmath32 and our opdf are proportional to each other , @xmath33 , the only difference being due to the fact that @xmath34 is normalized to unity .    for the case when the randomly adsorbed particles change their size , the opdf depends on the particular model of size transformation in the adsorbed state .",
    "several such models are discussed below .    * shrinking particles . * first , we consider a model in which particles of initial length @xmath35 shrink to the length of unity by randomly retracting one of their endpoints ( either on the left or on the right with equal probability ) .    in this model , no particles",

    "this model accounts for the particle repulsion in a model of hard disks , when the distance between the particle centers can not be smaller than a certain length that serves as their effective size .",
    "that length can often be larger than the actual particle size used in the description of the resulting coverage .",
    "a similar model reasonably describes the peb process in semiconductors , when both secondary particles produced by impact ionization are of the same mass and acquire equal kinetic energies .    with this opdf , equation ( [ mastw1 ] ) takes the form w(x ) = _ ( l-1)/2^x-(l+1)/2w(y)dy .",
