    "according to the standard unification model for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , seyfert 2 galaxies are intrinsically the same as seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the observed differences between the two types of seyfert galaxies are primarily due to an orientation effect ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies is due to obscuration by an optically thick structure ( the so - called dusty torus ) from our line of sight .",
    "optical spectropolarimetry observations have detected hidden broad emission lines in a large fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies ( moran et al .",
    "2000 ; tran 2001 ) , providing strong evidence in favor of the unification model .",
    "further support for this model is given by the x - ray studies that have demonstrated that many seyfert 2 galaxies are absorbed by large hydrogen column densities ( typically @xmath1 @xmath2 ; e.g. , risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "however , recent observations have shown that a fraction of type 2 agns show no or very low x - ray absorption measured from their x - ray spectra ( @xmath3 @xmath2 ; e.g. , pappa et al .",
    "2001 ; panessa & bassani 2002 ; walter et al . 2005 ; gliozzi , sambruna & foschini 2007 ) , apparently in contrast to the standard unification model .",
    "panessa & bassani ( 2002 ) estimate the percentage of this type of source in the range 10%20% . this number is larger than that found by risaliti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ( 4% ) , but consistent with the estimate made by caccianiga et al .",
    "( 2004 , 12% ) .",
    "x - ray unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies may result from the dust reddening intrinsic to the broad line region ( blr ) rather than the orientation - based obscuration effects ( barcons , carrera & ceballos 2003 ; corral et al .",
    "2005 ) . alternatively ,",
    "the unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies may genuinely lack the blr as a result of low accretion rate ( georgantopoulos & zezas 2003 ; bianchi et al . 2008 ; panessa et al .",
    "in other words , low - accretion rate systems may not form a stable blr ( see nicastro 2000 for the model ) , so they would not show broad lines in their optical spectra , and not necessarily being obscured in x - ray . though the discovery of `` unobscured '' type 2 agns has important implications for the current unification model ( i.e. , in addition to the orientation effects , other physical effects should be invoked to interpret the difference observed between type 1 and type 2 agns ) , only few objects have yet been conclusively proven as a class .",
    "it has been argued that some `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxies are actually compton - thick ( e.g. , pappa et al . 2001 ) , in which the direct nuclear component below 10 kev is completely suppressed and we would only witness an unabsorbed spectrum due to scattered nuclear radiation and/or host galaxy emission from a circumnuclear starburst . more recently , brightman & nandra ( 2008 ) presented a detailed spectral analysis of six unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies , and found that four out of them are in fact heavily obscured ( see also ghosh et al .",
    "in addition , shi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) presented a multi - wavelength study of a sample of unobscured seyfert 2 galaxies , and found that most of them are actually intermediate - type agns with broad emission lines or compton - thick sources .",
    "therefore , one has to be cautious in identifying the candidates of the unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies . in this paper , we present new _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 7590 , one of the so - called `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "ngc 7590 ( @xmath4 ) belongs to the extended 12  @xmath5 m sample ( rush , malkan & spinoglio 1993 ) .",
    "no broad h@xmath6 emission line is visible in either direct or polarized light ( heisler , lumsden & bailey 1997 ) . the first x - ray spectrum observed by _",
    "asca _ was analyzed by bassani et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "their best - fit model is an unabsorbed power law with @xmath7 , and n@xmath8 @xmath2 .",
    "no fe k emission line is detected in the _ asca _ data .",
    "@xmath9 hri imaging has shown that there is an off - nuclear ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) that is probably associated with the galaxy ngc 7590 ( colbert & ptak 2002 ) .",
    "the better spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ allows us to see more directly the x - ray emission from the nuclear region . in the following",
    ", a cosmology with @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is assumed throughout .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ pointing observation of ngc 7590 ( denoted obs 1 ) was made on 2007 april 30 for a duration of about 45 ks . besides the pointing observation , the source was also detected @xmath14 9 arcmin away from the center of the field of view ( fov ) of ngc 7582 _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations during revolution 267 ( 2001 may , obs 2 ) for @xmath1423 ks and revolution 987 ( 2005 april , obs 3 ) for @xmath14 102 ks .",
    "the calibrated event lists for both the pn and the mos observations were extracted using the epchain and emchain pipeline tasks provided by the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) version 9.0.0 , using the latest calibration files available at the time of analysis ( 2009 august ) . in our analysis",
    "we deal only with events corresponding to patterns 0 - 4 for the pn and 0 - 12 for the mos instruments .",
    "we excluded the epochs of high background events with sas task @xmath15 .",
    "as an instance , we plot in figure 1 the pn and mos1 light curves of obs1 ( black ) , which was heavily polluted by high background flares , together with the derived good time intervals ( green ) by @xmath15 .",
    "the log of all the _ xmm - newton _ observations with net exposure times is shown in table 1 .",
    "details of both source and background spectra extraction are shown in section 3.2 .",
    "in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and fully utilize the spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ , we extracted a co - added mos image from three observations , which has better spatial resolution than pn detector , and re - binned with a pixel size of 1.1@xmath16 ( 1 mos pixel ) .",
    "the resultant image is displayed in figure 2 ( a ) .",
    "the cross marks the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "a bright point - like source ( source x-1 ) is detected by _ xmm - newton _ about 25@xmath16  away from the galaxy nucleus , which was originally detected in the @xmath9 all - sky survey , identified as a ulx by colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) .",
    "it can be seen from figure 2 ( a ) that the emission of ngc 7590 is resolved at the _ xmm - newton _ spatial resolution , extending to tens of arcsec from the center . to quantify this",
    ", we first extract the radial profile of the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 . to avoid the contamination from the bright off - nuclear x-1 , only photons below the dashed line in figure 2 .",
    "( a ) were extracted with 1.1  annular bins .",
    "the radial profile for x-1 was also extracted ( without excluding the extended emission from ngc 7590 ) for comparison .",
    "the resulting radial profiles normalized to the peak brightness of ngc 7590 are shown in figure 2(c ) .",
    "we then fitted the radial profiles with the mos point - spread function ( psf ) model from calibration files using the sas routine @xmath17 .",
    "it is obvious in the figure that the radial profile of ngc 7590 significantly differs from that of the off - nuclear source x-1 and mos psf model out to radii of @xmath1430 , showing that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is clearly extended .",
    "the radial profile of the ulx is in crude agreement with the psf model , as expected from a point source emission .",
    "we further used scisim ( version 2.1 ) to simulate a mos image of two point sources at the same position of the ulx and the nucleus of ngc 7590 .",
    "we first extracted the x - ray counts from the observed image for the ulx within an aperture responding to the @xmath1450% encircled energy radius ( @xmath149@xmath16)50% of all the x - ray photons are encircled within this radius .",
    "see _ xmm - newton _ users handbook , section 3.2.1 ] , and estimated total net counts of @xmath18 for ulx after aperture correction .",
    "we then subtracted 1730 from the total counts of ulx plus ngc 7590 within 40@xmath16  radius circle and obtained net counts of @xmath14 1380 for ngc 7590 itself . in our simulation",
    ", we assumed that both ngc 7590 and ulx would have a power law spectrum with @xmath19 .",
    "local background was added to the simulated image and the result is shown in figure 2(b ) . by comparing the simulated image with the observed one",
    ", we see that the observed x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is clearly extended .",
    "we also created a co - added pn image ( excluding obs 3 ) with a pixel size of @xmath20 ( 1 pn pixel ) , and extracted radial profiles from it for ngc 7590 and ulx .",
    "figure 2(d ) and ( f ) show the resulting pn image and radial profiles , which are similar to that of mos , confirming that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is extended .",
    "we also present archival rosat hri image for ngc 7590 ( figure 2(e ) ) , which has even better spatial resolution than _ xmm - newton _ .",
    "however , the hri image is too shallow for more detailed spatial analysis , and its soft x - ray coverage prevents us from estimating the nuclei hard x - ray emission .",
    "there is possibility that the observed spatial extent of ngc 7590 and ulx is due to the alignment errors when adding images of three _ xmm - newton _ observations for both pn and mos data respectively . to test this , we extracted the radial profile of x - ray emission of ngc 7590 and ulx , using only mos image of obs 3 ( figures 3.(a ) and ( d ) ) , which has the longest exposure . compared to figures 2.(a ) and ( c ) ,",
    "we do not found significant difference in the spatial extent of ngc 7590 and ulx , indicating it is unlikely that the observed extended emission of ngc 7590 is caused by image alignment errors .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) show the soft - band ( 0.52 kev ) and hard - band ( 210 kev ) mos images of obs 3 , and figures ( e ) and ( f ) are the extracted radial profile , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the spatial extent of soft - band emission of ngc 7590 and ulx agrees well with previous results .",
    "all these results suggest that the ulx is a point - like source , but the x - ray emission of ngc 7590 is clearly extended . indeed",
    ", it is presumable that the hard - band image of ngc 7590 will be more point - like .",
    "however , as one can see from figure .",
    "3(c ) , the hard - band emission of ngc 7590 is relatively rather weak . due to",
    "the poor s / n of the radial profile of ngc 7590 ( figure .",
    "3(f ) ) , we can not tell whether its hard - band emission is extended or more point - like .",
    "@xmath21 spectra for ngc 7590 and x-1 were both extracted for spectral analysis . for ulx x-1 , to minimize the contamination from the extended emission in ngc 7590 , we extracted source spectra using a 9@xmath16 radius circle ( encircles @xmath1450% of all the x - ray photons at off - axis angles less than 10 arcmin on the mos detector , see section 3.1 ) for both pn and mos cameras , and aperture correction was applied after spectral fitting . for ngc 7590 , we extracted source spectra from a circular region with a radius of 40  centered at the galaxy nucleus , but excluded all photons above the dashed line in figure 2(a ) to reduce the pollution from x-1 .",
    "assuming that the x - ray emission from ngc 7590 is symmetric to the dashed line , hereafter we applied flux correction by a factor of 2 to the spectral fitting results to estimate the total x - ray flux from ngc 7590 ( excluding x-1 ) .",
    "for both pn and mos data , the background events were then extracted from a source - free area on the same ccd using two circular regions with a combined area @xmath14 4 times larger than the source region .",
    "the response matrix and ancillary response file for the pn spectrum were generated using the rmfgen and arfgen tools within the sas software .",
    "we examined the source light curves of ngc 7590 and ulx , and found no significant intra - exposure variations .",
    "no spectral variations between individual exposures were detected either through preliminary spectral fitting .",
    "hereafter , we combined spectra from individual exposures to increase the spectral quality and finally obtained one pn and one mos spectra for each source ( ngc 7590 and x-1 ) .",
    "the combined spectra were then grouped to have at least 1 count per bin , and the @xmath22-statistics ( cash 1979 ) was adopted for minimization .",
    "spectral fitting was performed jointly to the pn and mos data in the 0.38 kev range using xspec ( version 11.3.2 ) .",
    "all statistical errors given hereafter correspond to 90% confidence for one interesting parameter ( @xmath23 ) , unless stated otherwise . in all of the model fitting ,",
    "the galactic column density was fixed at @xmath24 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "all model parameters will be referred to in the source frame .    _",
    "ngc 7590 : _ we first performed the spectral fitting with a simple absorbed power law .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xmath2 , with @xmath22=520.8 for 436 degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that the simple absorbed power law model does not provide a good representation of the data , leaving the significant residuals at the low energy of the spectra .",
    "x - ray studies of seyfert 2 galaxies have shown that their spectra often show a soft excess at lower energy band , presumably due to a thermal emission component ( e.g. , cappi et al .",
    "thus we added an optically - thin thermal emission component ( using the apec model in xspec ) to the absorbed power law .",
    "a significantly improved fit ( @xmath27 for two extra parameters ) is obtained with best - fitting temperature of the thermal component @xmath28 = 0.31@xmath29 kev .",
    "we then obtained the photon index @xmath30 , while the column density is constrained to be less than @xmath31 @xmath2 . when we add a narrow gaussian line , with energy fixed at 6.4 kev ( the rest energy of the fe  k@xmath6 line ) to the above model , the change of @xmath32 is less than 1 for addition of one free parameter , suggesting that the line is not detected .",
    "we therefore obtained an upper limit on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the line of @xmath14680 ev .",

    "ngc  7590 was previously identified as an `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxy , on the basis of the _ asca _ spectrum ( bassani et al . 1999 ) .",

    "data , nicastro , martocchia & matt ( 2003 ) estimated that the accretion rate for ngc 7590 is very low ( @xmath57 ) , suggesting it may intrinsically lack a blr .",
    "meanwhile , ngc 7590 has not shown a hidden blr in polarized light ( heisler et al .",

    "2006 ) and a black hole mass of 6.2@xmath59 derived from @xmath60 relation ( bian & gu 2007 ) , we obtain a rough estimate for ngc 7590 the accretion rate @xmath61 , a value close to the threshold ( @xmath62 ) for blr formation proposed by nicastro et al .",

    "however , xmm images suggest a compton - thick obscuration to the nucleus of ngc 7590 , thus supports the scenario that the non - detection of hidden blr in this source could be attributed to heavy obscuration ( see shu et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the intrinsic lack of blr is not necessarily required .",

    "<S> the nuclear x - ray emission is rather weak comparing with the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> based on its very low x - ray luminosity as well as the small ratio between the 2 - 10 kev and the [ o iii ] fluxes , we interpret ngc 7590 as compton - thick rather than being an `` unobscured '' seyfert 2 galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> future higher resolution observations such as _ chandra _ are crucial to shed light on the nature of the ngc 7590 nucleus . </S>"
