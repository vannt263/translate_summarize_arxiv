    "high energy meson electroproduction off complex nuclei offers a promising tool to study the physics of hadron formation . the nuclear environment makes it possible to investigate the properties of hadrons immediately after their creation . in addition one can vary the energy and virtuality of the exchanged photon to examine the phenomenon of color transparency @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study exclusive incoherent @xmath0 electroproduction off @xmath1n and @xmath2kr in the energy regime of the hermes experiment @xcite . in this kinematic regime",
    "the coherence length of the photon s @xmath0 component is large and quantum mechanical interference effects play an important role . in @xcite",
    "we presented a method to account for this so - called shadowing effect in photoproduction within a semi - classical buu transport model which we now apply for electron induced reactions .",
    "we distinguish between the initial state interactions of the photon that give rise to shadowing and the final state interactions ( fsi ) of the produced particles .",
    "the coupled channel treatment of the fsi within the transport model allows for a broader spectrum of fsi than the usually used glauber theory  @xcite .",
    "in addition we account for fermi motion and pauli blocking during the reaction and take the finite lifetime of unstable reaction products into account .",
    "the time that the products of an elementary photon - nucleon interaction need to evolve to physical hadrons is called formation time . any change in the reaction probability of a hadron @xmath3 during its formation time",
    "affects the so - called nuclear transparency @xmath4 if the formation length , i.e. the length that @xmath3 travels during its formation time , exceeds the average internucleon distance ( @xmath5  fm ) inside the nucleus .    in the case of diffractive vector meson electroproduction ( @xmath6 )",
    "the virtual photon initially produces a colorless @xmath7-pair whose size is expected to decrease with increasing photon virtuality @xmath8@xcite .",
    "as long as the @xmath7-pair is very small , i.e. in the early stage of its evolution into the physical vector meson , it mainly reacts via its color dipole moment .",
    "this leads to a cross section that is quadratic in the @xmath7-pair s size . at large enough energies",
    "the @xmath7-pair is frozen in this small sized configuration over a distance that , because of time dilatation , can exceed the diameter of a nucleus .",
    "this effect leads to a large nuclear transparency for vector meson production at large photon energy @xmath9 and virtuality @xmath8 ( color transparency ) . for a detailed review of color transparency see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is not clear whether the energy and the virtuality of the photon in the hermes experiment is large enough to see an onset of color transparency . in the present paper",
    "we do not find evidence for a finite formation time of the produced vector meson .",
    "the @xmath1n data for the transparency ratio as function of the coherence length is compatible with the assumption that the diffractively produced @xmath0 starts interacting with a hadronic cross section right after its production .",
    "kopeliovich et al .",
    "@xcite point out that this might be an accidental consequence of the specific correlation between the @xmath8 of the photon and the coherence length of the @xmath0 in the hermes data . in their work a light - cone qcd formalism was used to incorporate formation and coherence length effects in coherent and incoherent vector meson electroproduction .",
    "in addition the effect of gluon shadowing was studied , but found to be negligible in the case of incoherent @xmath10 production . in ref .",
    "@xcite the decrease of the transparency ratio due to the finiteness of the @xmath0 lifetime was discussed as well .",
    "this effect is automatically included within our transport model .",
    "our coupled channel calculation shows in addition that the effects of side - feeding in the fsi are unimportant because of the kinematic cuts of the hermes experiment .",
    "therefore glauber theory seems to be appropriate for these reactions .",
    "however , we find that for heavy nuclei the kinematic cuts lead to an additional reduction of the transparency ratio due to elastic fsi which scatter the produced particle out of the acceptance window .",
    "one must therefore be careful which cross section one uses to describe the fsi in glauber theory .",
    "our paper is structured in the following way : in section  [ subsec : shadowing ] we show how we describe the electron - nucleon interaction and how we account for shadowing within our model . in the limit of purely absorptive fsi our result for the incoherent vector meson production cross section turns out to be equivalent to the known glauber result of huefner et al .",
    "however , in contrast to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite our expression allows for an intuitive physical interpretation .",
    "the transport model itself is sketched in section  [ subsec : transport ] .",
    "the results of our calculations for the exclusive incoherent @xmath0 production cross section within the coupled channel treatment are presented in section  [ sec : results ] in comparison with experimental data from the hermes experiment .",
    "we close with a short summary and outlook in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the one photon exchange picture the interaction of an electron and a nucleon ( or nucleus ) can be reduced to the reaction of a virtual photon on the hadronic target .",
    "the exchange of more than one photon is suppressed by further factors of the fine structure constant @xmath11 .",
    "we follow the method of friberg and sjostrand  @xcite and use the event generator pythia  v6.2  @xcite to describe the interaction of the ( virtual ) photon and a nucleon .",
    "the basic idea is that in a photon hadron collision the photon not necessarily interacts as a point particle ( direct interaction ) but might fluctuate into a vector meson @xmath12 ( vector meson dominance ) or perturbatively branch into a @xmath7 pair before the interaction ( generalized vector meson dominance , gvmd ) . within the pythia model it turns out that the latter is very unlikely in the kinematic regime of the hermes experiment ( photon energy @xmath13  gev , @xmath14  gev@xmath15 ) as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pythia ] where we show the contribution of the different photon components to the total @xmath16 cross section at an invariant mass @xmath175  gev . in most cases",
    "the photon will therefore scatter deep inelastically from a parton of the target nucleon or fluctuate into a vector meson before it reaches the nucleon . in the latter case",
    "the vector meson might either scatter diffractively from the nucleon or a hard scattering between the constituents of the vector meson and the nucleon might take place .",
    "the hard scattering leads to the excitation of one or two hadronic strings which finally fragment into hadrons .",
    "we assume that the hadrons that emerge from the edges of these strings , i.e. those that contain quarks not originating from the string fragmentation , can interact with a hadronic cross section right after the photon nucleon reaction .",
    "consequently , for the diffractively produced vector meson we do not use a formation time since none of its constituents arise from a string fragmentation .",
    "if the struck nucleon is embedded in a nucleus one has to account for its fermi motion and binding energy as well as pauli blocking of final state nucleons .",
    "in addition one has to be aware that the nuclear environment influences the vmd part of the photon nucleon interaction , since the vector meson components get modified on their way through the nuclear medium to the interaction point .",
    "we express the physical photon state @xmath18 in terms of vector meson states @xmath19 and a state @xmath20 which consists of the point - like photon and the gvmd part .",
    "this makes sense if one assumes that the gvmd part does not get shadowed or as in our case is unimportant for kinematic reasons : @xmath21 the formfactor @xmath22\\left(\\frac{m_v^2}{m_v^2+q^2}\\right)^2\\ ] ] is taken from  @xcite and also accounts for contributions of longitudinal photons . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : formfactor ] ) @xmath9 denotes the energy of the photon , @xmath8 its virtuality and @xmath23 the mass of the vector meson @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the invariant mass of the photon nucleon system .    for a photon with momentum @xmath26 the wave function of the component",
    "@xmath24 can be written as @xmath27 on the way through the nucleus the vector meson components get modified .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath28 nucleons at positions @xmath29 which are labeled in such a way that @xmath30 . according to glauber theory",
    "@xcite the wave function @xmath31 behind the first nucleon looks like @xmath32 if one neglects off - diagonal scattering from one vector meson component into another ( diagonal approximation ) .",
    "the phase factor in the second term arises from putting the vector meson component on its mass shell , i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the corresponding momentum transfer .",
    "the profile function @xmath35 is related to the elastic vector meson nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath36 in the following way : @xmath37 after passing the second nucleon the wave function takes on the form @xmath38 at position @xmath39 the whole ensemble of @xmath28 nucleons has led to the modification @xmath40\\theta(z - z_k)e^{ik_vz}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\left\\{1-\\sum_{j=1}^a\\gamma_v(\\vec b-\\vec s_j)e^{iq_v(z_i - z)}\\prod_{k\\neq",

    "\\label{eq : av_profile}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to get to the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : av_profile ] ) we have followed the way of @xcite , i.e. making use of the independent particle model and the large @xmath28 limit and used the optical theorem to express the elastic forward scattering amplitude in terms of the total @xmath44 cross section @xmath45 : @xmath46 the nucleon number density is denoted by @xmath47 and normalized to @xmath28 .    neglecting any influence of the fsi ,",
    "the reaction amplitude for the process @xmath48 on a nucleon at position @xmath49 inside a nucleus changes compared to the vacuum due to these initial state interactions of the photon : @xmath50 by comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : vmd ] ) and ( [ eq : inmediumstate ] ) one sees that to account for shadowing in incoherent photoproduction one only has to multiply the amplitude of each vector meson states @xmath19 by the corresponding factor @xmath51 .",
    "this is equivalent to the method we used in  @xcite .",
    "we now compare our method of describing shadowing of incoherent electroproduction with conventional glauber results .",
    "we therefore calculate the incoherent vector meson electroproduction cross section off a nucleus and assume purely absorptive fsi for the moment .",
    "after averaging over all positions @xmath41 we get : @xmath52\\right|^2\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\quad\\times \\exp\\left[-\\sigma_v^{inel}\\intop_{z}^\\infty dz ' n(\\vec b , z')\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ eq : falter ] ) we again neglect off - diagonal scattering , i.e. @xmath24 production is triggered by the @xmath24 component of the photon only .",
    "the last factor in ( [ eq : falter ] ) includes the inelastic @xmath44 cross section @xmath53 and accounts for the fsi .",
    "the production process described by eq.([eq : falter ] ) can be understood as follows : the incoherent vector meson production takes place on a nucleon at position @xmath54 .",
    "the production is triggered either directly by the photon or via an intermediate vector meson which was earlier produced on a nucleon at position @xmath55 without excitation of the nucleus .",
    "the interactions of this vector meson on its way from @xmath56 to position @xmath39 are of optical potential type and leave the nucleus in its ground state .",
    "this propagation is described by the second exponential in ( [ eq : falter ] ) .",
    "the interference between the direct and the indirect process leads to shadowing .",
    "the nucleus gets excited in the incoherent reaction at position @xmath39 .",
    "the possibility that the vector meson is lost on its way from position @xmath39 out of the nucleus is taken care of by the last exponential .",
    "expression ( [ eq : falter ] ) formally differs only slightly from the approximate result for the incoherent vector meson production cross section which is given without derivation in ref .",
    "the latter can be obtained by making the following replacements in ( [ eq : falter ] ) : @xmath57 the last replacement simply means that one neglects the possibility of elastic @xmath44 scattering whereas the occurrence of the different phase factor is unclear .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have given a seemingly different result for incoherent @xmath24 electroproduction : @xmath58e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{v}^{inel}-\\sigma_{v}^{el})t_{z_2}(\\vec b)-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{v}t_{z_1}(\\vec b)}\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\quad-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(\\sigma_{v})^2}{\\sigma_{v}^{el}}\\left|\\intop_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}dzn(\\vec b , z)e^{iq_vz}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{v}t_z(\\vec b)}\\right|^2\\biggl\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "expression ( [ eq : kopeliovich ] ) can be interpreted as follows : the last term represents the coherent @xmath24 photoproduction cross section which is subtracted from the inclusive @xmath24 photoproduction cross section to yield the incoherent part . in appendix",
    "a we show that the physically more transparent expression ( [ eq : falter ] ) is mathematically identical to ( [ eq : kopeliovich ] ) .      up to now",
    "we have ignored the effects of fermi motion , binding energies and pauli blocking of final state nucleons in the process described by ( [ eq : transition ] ) .",
    "in addition we neglected the finite life time of the @xmath0 and took only absorptive fsi into account .",
    "these shortcomings are avoided when using the model of ref .",
    "the propagation of the final state @xmath61 through the nucleus is treated within a semi - classical transport model based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation .",
    "the buu equation describes the time evolution of the phase space density @xmath62 of particles of type @xmath63 that can interact via binary reactions . besides the nucleons these particles involve baryonic resonances and mesons ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath10 , @xmath66 , ... ) that are produced either in the primary reaction or during the fsi . for a particle species",
    "@xmath63 the buu equation can be written as : @xmath67.\\ ] ] for baryons the hamilton function @xmath68 includes a mean field potential which depends on the particle position and momentum .",
    "the collision integral on the right hand side accounts for the creation and annihilation of particles of type @xmath63 in a collision as well as elastic scattering from one position in phase space into another . for fermions pauli blocking",
    "is taken into account in @xmath69 via blocking factors .",
    "the buu equations of each particle species @xmath63 are coupled via the mean field and the collision integral .",
    "the resulting system of coupled differential - integral equations is solved via a test particle ansatz for the phase space density . for details of the transport model",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the classes of fsi that are included in the transport model goes far beyond what can be achieved within glauber theory . as a result",
    "the finally observed @xmath0 does not need to be created in the primary reaction but might be produced during the fsi via side feeding .",
    "it is therefore clear that a purely absorptive treatment of the fsi as in glauber theory can only be used if one is sure that one has eliminated the possibility of side feeding by applying enough constraints on the observable ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "we also stress that within our model instable particles might decay during their propagation through the nucleus . in case of the @xmath0",
    "this means that both pions have to escape the nucleus without further rescattering to make the identification of the @xmath0 still possible .",
    "before we turn to nuclear targets we first verify that the input of our model is reasonable .",
    "we therefore look at exclusive @xmath0 production off hydrogen .",
    "we use the same kinematical cuts as in the hermes experiment   @xcite , i.e. the final state has to consist of two oppositely charged pions with invariant mass between @xmath70  gev and @xmath71  gev .",
    "the four momentum transfer @xmath72 between the virtual photon and the @xmath73-pair has to be smaller than 0.4  gev@xmath15 and we apply the exclusivity measure @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the nucleon mass and @xmath76 the 4-momentum of the undetected final state . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : py ] ) @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the 4-momenta of the incoming photon and the detected @xmath73 pair and @xmath79 is the 4-momentum of the struck nucleon which , for the calculation of @xmath80 , is assumed to be at rest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : elementary ] we compare our calculation of the exclusive @xmath0 production cross section off hydrogen with experimental data  @xcite . in the whole @xmath8 region covered by the hermes experiment",
    "we find very good agreement for a broad range of the invariant mass @xmath25 of the photon nucleon system .",
    "also the slope of the differential production cross section is reproduced very well by the pythia model as can be seen from the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt ] where we show our calculation of @xmath81 together with the hermes data @xcite .    for our calculations on exclusive @xmath0 electroproduction off",
    "nuclei we again use the kinematic cuts of the hermes collaboration @xcite .",
    "this means that we restrict our exclusivity measure to the region @xmath82 and introduce a lower boundary for the four - momentum transfer @xmath830.09  gev@xmath15 as imposed by the hermes collaboration to get rid of coherently produced @xmath0 . from the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt ] one sees that the differential @xmath0 electroproduction cross section off @xmath1n is again in excellent agreement with the hermes data @xcite . throughout our calculations",
    "the effect of the nucleon potential turns out to be negligible .",
    "this is reasonable since the involved energies are much larger than the typical binding energies which are in the order of a few mev .",
    "a combined effect of fermi motion and pauli blocking on the incoherent differential production cross section is visible at @xmath84  gev@xmath15 . at @xmath85",
    "gev@xmath15 the differential cross section is about 25% smaller than the calculation without fermi motion and pauli blocking ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the reason for this reduction is that in the case that the bound nucleon moves towards the incoming photon the outgoing nucleon might be pauli blocked for small momentum transfers .",
    "note that this pauli blocking just means that the whole nucleus absorbs the transferred momentum , i.e. this event contributes to the coherent production cross section which we do not consider here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] we show the transparency ratio @xmath86 for exclusive @xmath0 production as a function of the coherence length @xmath87 .",
    "the solid line is the result that one gets if one uses eq .",
    "( [ eq : falter ] ) and accounts for two - body correlations by making the substitution  @xcite @xmath88 in ( [ eq : falter ] ) with @xmath89  gev .",
    "this is necessary to avoid unphysical contributions from processes where @xmath90 which would contribute for small values of the coherence length @xmath91 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that this bessel function parameterization yields a good description of shadowing in photoabsorption . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : falter ] ) we use for the total @xmath92 cross section @xmath93  mb and for the elastic part @xmath94 mb .",
    "these two values correspond to the @xmath95 cross sections used within the transport model for the involved @xmath0 momenta .",
    "the result of the transport model is represented by the open squares . for each hermes data point @xcite",
    "we have made a separate calculation with the corresponding @xmath9 and @xmath8 . in the case of @xmath1n",
    "the glauber and the transport calculation are in perfect agreement with each other and the experimental data .",
    "this demonstrates that , as we have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , glauber theory can be used for the fsi if the right kinematic constraints are applied . for comparison",
    "we also show the result of huefner et al .",
    "@xcite ( dashed curve ) as well as the result that one gets when using the approximate expression by yennie  @xcite including two - body correlations ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the somewhat larger transparency ratio of huefner et al .",
    "arises from the different density distribution that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite use which reduces the effect of fsi .",
    "the difference of the yennie result ( dotted curve ) and our calculation arises mainly from the different cross section in the fsi ( second replacement in ( [ eq : replacements ] ) ) .",
    "the different phase factor leads to the change in the transparency ratio at small coherence lengths , since @xmath96 .",
    "after applying all of the above cuts , nearly all of the detected @xmath0 stem from diffractive @xmath0 production for which the formation time is zero .",
    "the @xmath1n data seems to support the assumption that the time needed to put the preformed @xmath0 fluctuation on its mass shell and let the wave function evolve to that of a physical @xmath0 is small for the considered values of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the photon energy is too low to yield a large enough @xmath97 factor to make the formation length exceed the internucleon distance and make color transparency visible .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with that reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to @xmath2kr where we expect a stronger effect of the fsi .",
    "unfortunately there is yet no data available to compare with . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] the transport calculation for @xmath2kr gives a slightly smaller transparency ratio than the glauber calculation , especially at low values of the coherence length , i.e. small momenta of the produced @xmath0 .",
    "there are two reasons for this : about 10%  of the difference arises from the fact that within the transport model the @xmath0 is allowed to decay into two pions . the probability that at least one of the pions interacts on its way out of the nucleus is about twice as large as that of the @xmath0 .",
    "the other reason is that in the glauber calculation ( [ eq : falter ] ) only the inelastic part of the @xmath92 cross section enters whereas the transport calculation contains the elastic part as well .",
    "thus all elastic scattering events out of the experimentally imposed @xmath98-window are neglected in the glauber description .",
    "it is because of this @xmath98-window that also elastic @xmath92 scattering reduces the transport transparency ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] .",
    "both effects are more enhanced at lower energies and become negligible for the much smaller @xmath1n nucleus .",
    "we have developed a method to account for coherence length effects in incoherent electroproduction off nuclei which allows us to distinguish between the initial state interactions of the photon ( shadowing ) and the fsi of the reaction products .",
    "we have shown that our result is equivalent to the exact result of glauber theory if one treats the fsi as a purely absorptive one .",
    "we have then performed a coupled channel treatment of the fsi within a semi - classical transport model and calculated the transparency ratio for exclusive incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction off @xmath1n and @xmath2kr .",
    "the result for @xmath1n is in agreement with experimental data and with the glauber prediction .",
    "the latter shows that in the case of @xmath1n glauber theory is applicable after the kinematic cuts of the hermes experiment are applied .",
    "since we do not use a formation time for diffractively produced vector mesons we deduce that one can not see an onset of color transparency in the nitrogen data . for the @xmath2kr target",
    "no experimental data is available to compare with .",
    "however , we find deviations from the simple glauber model because of the finite life time of the @xmath0 and elastic scattering out of the kinematically allowed @xmath99-region . these effects should be taken into account when evaluating the @xmath2kr data in search of color transparency . as discussed by kopeliovich et al .",
    "@xcite one might see an onset of color transparency when investigating the transparency ratio as a function of @xmath8 for fixed coherence length @xcite . including a formation time for exclusive @xmath24 production is not straightforward within our model since a change of the @xmath44 cross section during the vector meson formation will influence both the initial as well as the final state interactions .",
    "this is planned for future work , when hopefully also the @xmath2kr data has become available .",
