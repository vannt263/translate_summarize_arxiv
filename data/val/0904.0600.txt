    "the population i _ sinusoidal _ or s - cepheids are a small group of the cepheids pulsating in the first radial overtone . in the galaxy , where individual cepheid distances are usually not accurately known ,",
    "the s - cepheids are discriminated from the fundamental mode pulsators with the fourier decomposition of their light curves @xcite .",

    "fortunately , it can be extended to longer periods with the help of the radial velocity curves , as was shown by @xcite .",
    "studies of the longer period overtone cepheids are of the great interest .",
    "the velocity fourier parameters of the s - cepheids display a very characteristic progression with period , which is attributed to the 2:1 resonance at @xmath4day between the first and fourth overtones @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , any detailed modeling of this progression and pinpointing of the resonance position is hampered by a scarcity of the s - cepheids with @xmath5day , with my  pup being the only secure identification .",
    "one more candidate , v440  per ( @xmath6day ) , has been identified by @xcite .",
    "they noted , that the velocity fourier phase @xmath2 places this cepheid away from the fundamental mode sequence and possibly onto the first overtone sequence . on this basis , @xcite proposed that v440  per is an overtone pulsator .",
    "this hypothesis was further supported by determination of the phase - lag between the light curve and the radial velocity curve , @xmath7 , which placed v440  per away from the fundamental sequence as well @xcite . however , v440  per is a small amplitude , nearly sinusoidal variable .",
    "even the best then available radial velocity data @xcite yielded large errors of the 1st harmonics fourier parameters .",
    "the measurement error of the phase - lag @xmath8 was large , too .",
    "this , and inconsistency with their hydrodynamic pulsation models led @xcite to dispute the mode identification of v440  per .",
    "they noted that the membership of this cepheid in the fundamental mode sequence could not be rejected at the @xmath9 confidence level .",
    "they argued that v440  per is not an overtone pulsator , but rather a fundamental mode cepheid of a very low amplitude .    in the present paper",
    "we report results of an extensive campaign of the observations of v440  per with the , lasting almost a year and aiming at obtaining high quality data suitable for the detailed diagnostic and comparison with the nonlinear models . in sect.[s1 ] we describe our instrument and observations . in sect.[s2 ] we discuss quality of our radial velocities and derive fourier parameters of v440  per .",
    "comparison with fourier parameters of other galactic cepheids and identification of the pulsation mode of v440  per is discussed in sect.[s3 ] . in sect.[rssec1 ] we perform detailed comparison of v440  per with the nonlinear overtone cepheid models .",

    ".fourier parameters of v440  per radial velocity curve [ t2 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     modeling of such a long period overtone pulsator is not an easy task . the satisfactory models have to reproduce fourier parameters and the long period of this variable .",
    "the current hydrocodes used for modeling of the radial pulsations adopt a time - dependent convection models ( e.g. stellingwerf 1982 , kuhfu 1986 ) .",
    "these models introduce several dimensionless parameters , that should be adjusted to match the observational constraints .",
    "v440  per with its exceptionally long period , offers an opportunity to impose interesting limits on the free parameters of the convection treatment .",
    "in our computations we use the convective hydrocode of @xcite .",
    "the code adopts @xcite dynamical convection model reformulated for use in stellar pulsation calculations .",
    "kuhfu model is physically well motivated and self - consistent .",
    "it contains 8 scaling parameters , summary of which , together with the detailed description of the model equations is provided by @xcite .",
    "the values of parameters used in the present paper are given in table  [ rstab1 ] .",
    "all our cepheid models are constructed in the way described in @xcite . in all computations we use galactic chemical composition ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and opal",
    "opacities @xcite computed with the @xcite mixture .",
    "we use the mass - luminosity ( @xmath16 ) relation derived from @xcite evolutionary tracks ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "theoretical instability strips ( is ) computed with the linear pulsation code for set a of the convective parameters are presented in fig.[rshr ] .",
    "instability strips for the first overtone and for the fundamental mode are enclosed with the thick and thin lines , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to constant values of the first overtone period , as indicated in the figure .",
    "first overtone is does not extend toward an arbitrarily high luminosity .",
    "the linear computations yield an upper limit for the first overtone pulsation period , reaching @xmath18day in fig.[rshr ] ( see also table  [ rstab1 ] ) .",
    "this limit depends mostly on the adopted convective parameters , but also on the @xmath16 relation and on the metalicity .",
    "however , to find a model , that satisfies v440  per period constraint , it is not enough to assure appropriate linear period limit ( @xmath19day ) .",
    "this is because the maximum overtone period at _ full amplitude pulsation _ is determined by the nonlinear effects .    between the linear blue edges of the first overtone and of the fundamental mode and below their crossing point",
    ", the first overtone pulsation is the only possibility . as one can see in fig.[rshr ]",
    ", such a region is very narrow .",
    "a significant part of the overtone is lays inside the fundamental mode is . for higher luminosity and overtone periods",
    "longer than 6days , the instability strips of both modes entirely overlap .    in the region , where both modes are linearly unstable , the final pulsation state is determined by the nonlinear effects ( modal selection ) .",
    "full amplitude pulsation in one of the modes usually suffices to saturate the instability . in principle , a double - mode pulsation is also possible , but it is very unlikely at long overtone periods that are of interest in this paper ( no double - mode pulsator with such a long overtone period is known either in the galaxy , or in the magellanic clouds ; see soszyski et al .",
    "2008 , moskalik & koaczkowski , 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , construction of models matching period of v440  per requires both linear and nonlinear computations and can be used to constrain parameters of convection model we use .",
    "it is hard to constrain all 8 parameters entering the model .",
    "as was shown by @xcite , different combinations of the convective @xmath20 parameters may yield essentially the same results .",
    "therefore , we decided to freeze four parameters , for which standard values are in use . in",
    "all studied sets of the convective parameters ( table  [ rstab1 ] ) , mixing - length is set to @xmath21 and for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 we use the standard values ( see smolec & moskalik 2008 for details ) . set a represents the simplest convection model , without turbulent pressure , turbulent flux or radiative losses .",
    "these effects are turned on in set b ( radiative losses ) and in set c ( turbulent pressure and turbulent flux ) .",
    "one of the crucial factors of the convection model is eddy - viscous damping , the strength of which is determined by the @xmath25 parameter .",
    "the lower the eddy - viscous damping is ( lower @xmath25 ) , the more linearly unstable become the models and , consequently , the higher are their pulsation amplitudes .",
    "the most interesting outcome of the linear computations are the period limits , @xmath26 , given in the last column of table  [ rstab1 ] . at the linear theory level",
    ", all sets of convective parameters listed in the table can satisfy v440  per period constraint .",
    "this was assured by adjusting eddy - viscous damping parameter , @xmath25 . in case of sets",
    "a and c ( no radiative losses ) low values of @xmath25 are required .    for each parameter",
    "set we computed a sequence of nonlinear models , running parallel to the first overtone blue edge , at a constant distance @xmath27 . in this section",
    "we use @xmath28k .",
    "this choice is arbitrary , but we believe , that such models should reproduce most of the observed first overtone variables .",
    "the static models were initialized in the first overtone mode ( as described in smolec & moskalik 2008 ) and their time evolution was followed , until the final pulsation state was reached .",
    "the computed radial velocity curves were then decomposed into fourier series . in fig.[rsperiodc ]",
    "we plot amplitude @xmath29 _ vs. _ pulsation period for three sequences of models .",
    "the most satisfactory results are obtained for set b of the convective parameters .",
    "the pulsation amplitudes for this sequence are moderate and they match well the observations ( this conclusion will be strengthened in sect.[rssec12 ] ) .",
    "also , for this sequence we obtain the overtone models with the longest periods .",
    "sequences computed with the parameter sets a and c extend to periods not exceeding 6days .",
    "all more massive models ( _ i.e. _ with longer overtone periods ) switched into the fundamental mode pulsation and therefore are not plotted in the figure .",
    "the amplitudes of the models computed with the parameter sets a and c are larger .",
    "this is due to the adopted low value of the eddy - viscous damping , needed to obtain high enough limit for the linear overtone period . any further decrease of @xmath25 does not help .",
    "although @xmath26 increases , yet models switch into the fundamental mode at periods well below of 7.57days required to match v440  per .",
    "additionally , at the short periods the amplitudes of the first overtone models become unacceptably high .",
    "we conclude , that inclusion of the radiative losses is necessary to reproduce the long overtone period of v440  per . as we will demonstrate in sect.[rssec12 ] , with the set b of the convective parameters we can also reproduce the fourier parameters of v440  per , as well as the overall progression of fourier parameters for all observed overtone cepheids .",
    "for three sequences of overtone cepheid models .",
    "model amplitudes scaled by constant projection factor of 1.4 . except of v440  per , observational data points are taken from @xcite and @xcite.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    our conclusion is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "for convection with the radiative losses , their models extend toward high overtone periods ( parameter set a of szab et al .",
    "2007 ) . without radiative losses ( set b of szab et al . 2007 ) and with much higher eddy - viscous dissipation than in our set a , their longest overtone periods fall below 3days . comparing our models with the overtone cepheid models of @xcite we note some inconsistency .",
    "@xcite obtain long overtone periods for all sets of convective parameters considered in their paper .",
    "their results are inconsistent with the results of @xcite ( set a of feuchtinger et al . 2000 and set b of szab et al .",
    "2007 are identical , but their linear results are significantly different ) as well as with our results .",
    "we trace this discrepancy to different evaluation of the superadiabatic gradient , @xmath30 , in our and in the vienna code used by @xcite . in the vienna code ,",
    "the radiative pressure contribution is neglected in computation of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this leads to higher values of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 far from partial ionization regions , see figs .",
    "3 and 4 of wuchterl & feuchtinger 1998 ) and lower values of the superadiabatic gradient .",
    "consequently , in their models convection is less pronounced and the models are more unstable .",
    "in fact , we were able to reproduce their linear results when we neglected the contribution of radiation in the evaluation of @xmath31 .          in this section",
    "we focus our attention on set b of the convective parameters . as demonstrated in the previous section",
    ", this parameter set allows to reproduce the long overtone periods and the observed pulsation amplitudes . in fig.[rsfourier ] we compare the velocity fourier parameters of galactic overtone cepheids with those of the hydrodynamical models computed with the parameters of set b. four sequences of models displayed in the plot run at different distances from the first overtone blue edge ( @xmath33k , 75k , 125k , 175k ) . the overall observed progression of fourier parameters is well reproduced with our models . for @xmath2",
    ", we notice that the model sequences are shifted toward somewhat shorter periods .",
    "this can be easily explained .",
    "the characteristic progression of velocity @xmath2 with period is caused by the 2:1 resonance between the first overtone and the fourth overtone @xcite .",
    "the center of this resonance is located at @xmath34day .",
    "the exact location of the resonance in hydrodynamic models depends mostly on the chosen mass - luminosity relation .",
    "this relation was not adjusted in our calculations to match the observed resonance progression relation to satisfy the resonance constraint is not an easy task .",
    "both the slope and the zero point of the adopted @xmath16 relation affect location of the resonance and the shape of the @xmath2 progression . in a forthcoming publication ( smolec & moskalik , in preparation ) we address this problem in detail . ] .",
    "as shown in fig.[rshr ] , the resonance center ( displayed with the dashed line ) crosses the center of the first overtone is for periods shorter than 4days , which explains the horizontal shift in fig.[rsfourier ] . taking into account this shift ,",
    "amplitudes , amplitude ratios and fourier phases agree satisfactorily with observations , although at the short periods theoretical @xmath2 values are slightly too high .",
    "considering v440  per , we see the very good agreement with the model sequence closest to the blue edge of the overtone instability strip ( @xmath35k ) .",
    "an exact match can be easily obtained for the model sequence located slightly closer to the blue edge .",
    "we note , that the progression of the overtone @xmath2 at long periods is insensitive to the choice of @xmath27 .",
    "the models predict slightly higher @xmath2 than actually observed in v440  per , but the two values are consistent within the error bar .",
    "using our new we obtained 158 high precision radial velocity observations of a low amplitude cepheid v440  per .",
    "we constructed the pulsation velocity curve of v440  per and we were able to reliably detect its 1st harmonic , with amplitude of only @xmath36 m/s .",
    "the measured fourier phase @xmath37rad differs from the values observed in fundamental mode cepheids of a similar period by 7.25@xmath3 .",
    "thus , we demonstrated on purely morphological ground that v440  per does not pulsate in the fundamental mode .",
    "this settles the dispute between @xcite and @xcite and allows to classify v440  per as an overtone pulsator , the one with the longest period identified so far ( @xmath38day ) .",
    "our results demonstrate that with suitable care , our inexpensive instrument featuring musicos echelle spectrograph and a small robotic telescope can achieve stability and precision surpassed only in the extrasolar planet searches .",
    "note , that we employed neither the iodine cell nor environment control .",
    "yet , our observations prove that the secure mode identification is feasible even for the very low amplitude galactic cepheids .",
    "the overtone pulsation of v440  per has interesting theoretical consequences . to investigate them we employed our convective linear and nonlinear pulsation codes @xcite .",
    "the first overtone linear models are already constrained by the value of the pulsation period at the center of the @xmath39 resonance @xcite .",
    "the very existence of v440  per imposes additional constraints .",
    "namely , to linearly excite the first overtone and then to obtain a _ nonlinear full - amplitude _ overtone pulsation of such a long period , one has to fine tune the dynamical convection model used in the pulsation calculations .",
    "our numerical experiments demonstrate that in the convective energy transport radiative losses must be properly accounted for to maintain consistency with the observations . with this effect taken into account , the nonlinear overtone cepheid models not only reproduce the exceptionally long period of v440  per , but they also reproduce neatly all fourier parameters of its pulsation velocity curve .",
    "no such agreement can be achieved with models pulsating in the fundamental mode .",
    "these results of the hydrodynamical modeling provide additional support for our empirical classification of v440  per as a first overtone pulsator .",
    "this publication is based on the first results from , a large instrumental project developed at a.  mickiewicz university in pozna in the course of many years .",
