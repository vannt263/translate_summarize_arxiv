    "the data indicate that inelastic couplings to vibrational resonances in the molecule lead to enhanced transport at finite bias in the kondo regime .",
    "we also show that nanometer - scale metal junctions can , under certain circumstances , exhibit pronounced negative differential resistance tunable by a proximal gate electrode .",
    "we argue that this ndr most probably originates from the adsorption of a specific contaminant at the nanometer - scale interelectrode gap .",

    "this `` prebreaking '' is stopped once the junction resistance exceeds a few hundred ohms .",
    "subsequent examination of such junctions by scanning electron microscope ( sem ) indicates that the junctions are nearly broken , so that the applied voltage drops almost entirely across the now nano - scale constriction .",

    "it is difficult to perform precise measurements of electrode morphology .",

    "transport at high bias is enhanced by these additional channels , manifested as peaks in the differential conductance that parallel the edges of the blockaded diamonds .",
    "when the island is a nanoscale molecule , several issues arise .",
    "first , source and drain couplings are established by overlap of the molecular wavefunction with that of the conduction electrons of the leads .",
    "these couplings broaden the energies of the single - particle states by @xmath20 , and depend crucially on the details of the metal surface , the molecular orientation , and the chemical nature of the molecular binding .",
    "furthermore , the classical capacitance is so small that electrostatic charging energies in excess of 100  mev are reasonable .",
    "similarly , the spacings between the single - particle molecular states can easily be hundreds of mev or more . while there is some evidence that significant renormalizations of both these quantities may occur@xcite , most experiments@xcite find accessing more than two charge states of a single molecule to be extremely challenging .",
    "because of these large level spacings , tunneling through excited electronic states is generally not seen in smts .",
    "however , molecules do exhibit vibrational excitations at the mev scale",
    ". observations of tunneling through such excited states have been reported@xcite , as have vibrational effects in other gated molecular devices@xcite .",
    "a single - electron device with an unpaired spin may demonstrate nontrivial transport physics@xcite due to the kondo effect@xcite , the formation of a many - body state comprising the unpaired spin and an antiferromagnetically coupled screening cloud of conduction electrons in the leads .",
    "the energy scale , @xmath21 , for the kondo effect depends exponentially on the total coupling @xmath22 .",
    "it is possible to have a high kondo temperature while still having a low total conductance , since the conductance is limited by the smaller of @xmath23 while @xmath24 is set by their total .",
    "the signature of a kondo resonance in a single - electron device is the appearance of a peak in the differential conductance near zero source - drain bias when the number of charges on the island changes from even to odd . in a well - coupled system for @xmath25 the peak conductance on resonance",

    "this value may be significantly reduced if the source and drain couplings are very asymmetric . for @xmath27",
    ", the peak conductance is expected to decrease logarithmically with temperature .",
    "the shape of this resonance ( @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 ) may deviate from a pure lorentzian due to fano - type competition between kondo resonant transport and other channels@xcite . in an external magnetic field , @xmath28 , large enough to zeeman split the localized , unpaired spin , the kondo peak is expected to split by an amount @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the bohr magneton and @xmath31 is the land factor .",
    "kondo physics has been reported in molecular devices incorporating metal ions@xcite .",
    "our observation of c@xmath0-based devices is described below .",

    "negative differential resistance is well known and understood in two - terminal devices such as @xmath32 junctions@xcite , quantum well resonant tunneling diodes@xcite , and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements@xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism for each involves energy - specific conduction of charge carriers ; as the source - drain bias is swept into and out of the relevant energy range , the current varies nonmonotonically , leading to ndr over some range of bias voltage . in esaki diodes the current peaks due to the alignment of the valence and conduction bands across the @xmath32 junction over a limited range of bias . in quantum well devices",
    "the increase in conduction occurs when the energy of the injected carriers is resonant with a quasi - bound state of the well . here",
    "we will explore the origin of ndr in the sts measurements@xcite in more detail because we believe a similar mechanism is responsible for our ndr observations .    consider a tunneling spectroscopy measurement with electrons flowing from a probe tip to a conducting substrate , with a molecule attached to the substrate . to explain the observation of ndr one must abandon the common notion of a featureless tip density of states , and describe the current through the sts system with the general expression : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electrochemical potential of the metallic substrate and probe tip , respectively , with @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the tunneling transmission of the system . using the transfer hamiltonian formalism",
    ", one can relate @xmath37 to the product of the local densities of states ( ldos ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the molecule and the tip .",
    "the current through the sts system is proportional to the convolution of @xmath40 and @xmath41 within the energy range defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "suppose both the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 contain sharp peaks ( such as those caused by localized surface states , for example@xcite ) . as the bias is applied the ldos shift relative to one another , and it is possible for the energies of the sharp features to become commensurate .",
    "if this alignment happens when one sharp feature is occupied and the other is empty , one may observe ndr .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ndrexp]b , c , e .",
    "as the ldos peaks move toward ( away from ) each other in energy while the bias is swept , the current will increase ( decrease ) .",
    "energetics of substrate / molecule and tip apex / probe in sts measurements on molecules , after .",
    "sharp features represent local densities of states of the molecule ( left ) and the tip apex ( right ) .",
    "weak coupling allows a potential difference to develop between the molecule and substrate under bias .",
    "( a ) at equilibrium , with substrate chemical potential , @xmath42 , and probe chemical potential , @xmath35 ; ( b ) a positive bias @xmath43 is applied to the probe , and weak apex - probe coupling is assumed , leading to the apex potential @xmath44 .",
    "the ldos of the apex atom moves up relative to @xmath35 under bias , and ndr results ; ( c ) a negative bias is applied to the probe , again with @xmath45 .",
    "the ldos of the apex atom move down relative to @xmath35 , and ndr results ; ( d ) a positive bias is applied to the probe , with strong apex - probe coupling that forces @xmath46 .",
    "no ndr results because of relative positions of molecule and apex ldos ( e ) a negative bias is applied to the probe , with @xmath46 .",
    "since the ldos of the molecule must move down with respect to the @xmath35 under bias , ndr results.,width=302 ]    it is important to consider whether one expects to find ndr under both signs of bias within this picture ; both cases are observed in sts . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical issue is whether there is significant voltage dropped between the apex of the probe tip ( source of the sharp ldos peak ) and the bulk of the probe tip ( and similarly between the molecule and the substrate ) .",
    "if the apex and bulk of the tip are essentially at the same chemical potential , then ndr is only expected under one bias direction ( figure  [ fig : ndrexp]d , e ) .",
    "note that a weak coupling between the apex and bulk of the tip , a necessary condition for the observation of ndr under both signs of bias , would also imply poor screening near the tip apex .",
    "this is relevant when considering the effects of a proximal gate electrode .",
    "at present no microscopy technique allows direct assessment of the presence of a single nanometer - scale molecule at the source - drain interelectrode gap",
    ". therefore one must infer such information from transport measurements and control experiments .",
    "every electrode pair produced by the electromigration process is different at the nanometer scale .",
    "similarly , the positions , orientations , couplings to source , drain , and gate electrodes , of possible molecules near the interelectrode gaps are all probabilistic . with this fabrication technique _",
    "a statistical approach with large numbers of devices is essential_.    conduction characteristics at low temperatures after electromigration may be divided into four general classes :    * _ no detectable source - drain current_. the most likely explanation , confirmed by sem observation , is that the resulting interelectrode gap is too large for detectable source - drain conduction by either tunneling , thermionic , or field emission .",
    "* _ weak nonlinearity , no gate response_. this is the result most commonly seen in bare metal control devices , and presumably corresponds to electrodes sufficiently close ( 1 - 2  nm ) for some conduction , but without a molecule in the gap .",
    "* _ strong nonlinearity , no gate response_. the most probable explanation for such @xmath47 characteristics is that a molecule or metal nanoparticle is positioned between the source and drain , but device geometry results in extremely poor gate coupling . *",

    ".[tab : stats ] device yield statistics of c@xmath0 smts . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given a gateable , nonlinear @xmath47 characteristic consistent with coulomb blockade , it is _ essential _ to consider four other issues to help determine whether the device is a smt or a result of metal nanoparticles produced in the electromigration process .",
    "first , is the electron addition energy ( the maximum source - drain bias of the blockaded region ) of a sensible size for the molecule under consideration ? as mentioned above , the _ minimum _ addition energy , even in the absence of molecular level spacings , should be sensibly large for coulomb charging of a nanoscale object in a dielectric environment .",
    "addition energies significantly less than 50  mev should be considered carefully .",
    "second , are the number of accessible charge states of the device reasonable for a molecule ?",
    "solution - based electrochemistry provides an upper limit to the number of valence states that one should reasonably be able to explore . in electrochemical experiments ,",
    "the excess molecular charge is compensated by the presence of ions in the solvent that can be within a nanometer of the molecule .",
    "this screening should be more efficient than any possible in a conventional field effect geometry , even with an extremely thin gate dielectric .",
    "for example , c@xmath0 may be reduced in solution only a few times .",
    "therefore if one finds that it is possible to add ten or twenty electrons to a candidate device via gating ( _ i.e. _ there are many coulomb blockade crossing points ) , it is extremely unlikely that the active region of the candidate device is a single c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "this issue makes interpretation of some data@xcite challenging .",
    "third , are the particular gateable , nonlinear characteristics observed only when molecules are present ? we have observed clear coulomb blockade with various electron addition energies in a small percentage of bare metal control devices .",
    "clearly coulomb blockade characteristics alone are not sufficient to confirm the molecular character of a smt .",
    "similarly , the ndr effects described below appear predominantly in devices prepared _ without _ c@xmath0 molecules , and therefore can not represent a property of c@xmath0-based conduction .",
    "finally , are there features in the data that uniquely specify the molecule ? known vibrational resonances in particular can be extremely useful , and have been identified in several experiments@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : c60]a is a conductance map of a c@xmath0-based smt measured at 5  k. coulomb blockade is clearly evident , as is an uncontrolled change in offset charge ( the discontinuity at @xmath48  v ) .",
    "note that the electron addition energy significantly exceeds 100  mev , and that there are vibrational resonance features at @xmath49  35  mev , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "much of the noise in the data are an artifact of the numerical differentiation procedure",
    ". scans out to higher gate voltages in both polarities revealed no further coulomb blockade crossing points .",
    "this indicates that we were only able to change the charge state of this device by a single electron .",
    "( a ) map of differential source - drain conductance of a c@xmath0-based smt at 5  k , as a function of bias and gate voltage .",

    "v , conductance is consistent with coulomb blockade , including a likely vibrational resonance at @xmath49  35  mev .",
    "when @xmath6 is swept past the charge degeneracy point , a pronounced peak appears at zero bias .",
    "notice that the 35  mev peak continues into this regime .",
    "in fact both the 35  mev conductance and the zero - bias conductance are enhanced relative to the conductances measured in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "some indications of vibrational signatures in the kondo regime were present in an earlier experiment@xcite . in the c@xmath0 case shown here ,",
    "however , the vibrational mode is known .",
    "we also note that enhanced coupling to vibrational modes in the presence of a strong coupling between adsorbed molecular charge and metal conduction electrons is known to occur in other cases , such as the `` chemical enhancement '' contribution to surface - enhanced raman scattering@xcite .    a detailed analysis of several samples similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : c60]b is presented in ref .",
    "several points are noteworthy .",
    "first , only @xmath491 - 2% of c@xmath0-decorated electrodes eventually resulted in devices that showed this kondo - like conductance map .",
    "this is unsurprising when one recalls that @xmath52 depends exponentially on @xmath53 , which itself is exponentially sensitive to molecule - metal geometry .",
    "similarly , presumably because of these steep dependences , we found it extremely difficult to perform characterization of such devices over a broad temperature range due to irreversible changes in device characteristics .",
    "figure  [ fig : c60xition ] shows an example of this instability . at left",
    "is the conductance map of the device showing the transition to having the zero - bias resonance . during an attempt to characterize the temperature dependence of the zero - bias peak , the device spontaneously changed to a different configuration .",
    "subsequent measurements of the device yielded conductance characteristics like that shown in the plot at right , looking like coulomb blockade with poor gate coupling .",
    "the typical maximum conductance remains @xmath54  s despite this change in coupling , consistent with the idea that the couplings to the leads are asymmetric , as discussed above .",
    "example of an irreversible change from kondo - like conduction ( a ) to conventional coulomb blockade conduction ( b ) in a single device , likely due to an uncontrolled rearrangement of the molecule - electrode tip geometry .",
    "conductance is from zero ( black ) to @xmath55  s ( white ) . , width=302 ]    from the limited @xmath56-dependence data acquired , the zero - bias peak is essentially independent of @xmath56 below @xmath49  20  k. within the kondo picture the width of the peak is proportional to @xmath24 when @xmath56 is sufficiently below @xmath24 .",
    "our data are consistent with values of @xmath24 of around 100  k or more .",
    "this energy scale is so large that resolving zeeman splitting of the peak is unfeasible .",
    "the high kondo temperatures inferred in the c@xmath0 system may explain another observation@xcite in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) using probe tips made from c@xmath0 adsorbed on platinum - iridium .",
    "those stm measurements indicated a surprisingly narrow , peaked density of states for the tips .",
    "one explanation for such a feature would be a kondo resonance between the physisorbed c@xmath0 and the tip , perhaps surviving even at 300  k. experiments on c@xmath0 smts with pt electrodes are planned .",
    "we note that fabricating smts that are mechanically and electrically stable and exhibit kondo physics at room temperature would have significant implications for practical devices . such smts would be switchable by gating from a coulomb blockaded state to resonant conduction with conductances approaching @xmath57 , the theoretical maximum per molecule .",
    "such devices would remain vulnerable to offset charge problems characteristic of single - electron architectures@xcite .",
    "they would , however , offer the only known means of modulating such high conductances per molecule apart from larger structures involving perfectly contacted carbon nanotubes .      in a series of control experiments , electromigrated control samples that were exposed to various solvents ( e.g. thf , toluene , methyl chloride ) prior to being place in the vacuum probe station were thermally cycled multiple times over the course of three to five days . in 10% of 175",

    "examples of @xmath47 characteristics ( @xmath58 , @xmath59  k ) for control samples ( no c@xmath0 ) exposed to non - uhv conditions repeatedly .",
    "ndr can occur for either one or both bias polarities.,width=302 ]    we suggest that the ndr results from sharp features in the densities of states of the source and drain electrodes due to adsorbed impurities .",
    "the role of unintended adsorbates seems clear , since the ndr tends to appear as surfaces are exposed for significant periods in non - uhv conditions .",
    "we believe that there is _ one particular kind of adsorbate _ that causes the ndr in our control devices .",
    "the evidence for our assertion is shown in fig .  [",

    "regions of ndr are indicated by the arrows .",
    "the concurrency of ndr in both bias directions and the gateablity of the devices reflects the extended screening length in the metal - molecule junction when the apex of the electrode is weakly coupled to the bulk of the electrode . if the screening length is long enough for the emergence of a voltage drop between the apex and the bulk of the electrode , then it would likely to be long enough for the gate to influence the electrostatic potential of the metal - molecule junction .",
