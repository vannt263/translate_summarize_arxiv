    "unique among the leptons , the tau is massive enough to decay semi - hadronically .",
    "many hadronic branching fractions are predicted with precision in the standard model , motivating correspondingly accurate measurements as probes of new physics .",
    "tau decays also furnish a remarkably potent production source for mesons , the properties of which are then available for study .",
    "although the internal inconsistencies and disagreements between measured and predicted branching fractions have diminished in the past several years , the process of rate measurements for every conceivable mode and unrelenting improvement of precision continues .",
    "the larger branching fractions are measured with relative errors below one percent , signals for rare decays are seen at the @xmath0 level , and forbidden decay rate upper limits approach @xmath1 . anticipating the completion of the lep  i and cleo  ii programs , experimenters are exploiting the large datasets and pursuing improved understanding of the detectors and better analysis techniques to further study hadronic tau decays .    in earlier workshops the experimental emphasis initially focussed on putting  detection on par with that of charged particles for modes with one or multiple s ; strange particle identification efforts moved from detached vertex finding for @xmath2 , to @xmath3 or rich calibration for @xmath4 , to calorimetry for @xmath5 .",
    "these techniques have been refined while datasets have grown , allowing more challenging modes involving _ multiple _ kaons and/or _ multiple _ s to be measured .    in order to make quantitative conclusions from the large number of new and old measurements , the common practice of forming weighted averages of all branching fractions is followed here .",
    "for each mode , the `` new world average '' ( nwa ) weights each of @xmath6 measurements by its inverse - square total error , which is the quadrature sum of statistical and systematic contributions .",
    "the nwa error is computed as the inverse of the quadrature sum of the inverse total errors , scaled up by the particle data group @xcite scale factor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . for this review ,",
    "i have omitted any entries that , by virtue of their errors relative to others , contribute less than 5% of the weight in the nwa .",
    "pdg98 @xcite contains the complete listings .",
    "these nwa s only are only approximate for a number of reasons : many newer measurements are preliminary ; some systematic errors may be correlated and therefore should not be combined in quadrature ; biased weighting can occur for statistics - limited measurements .",
    "in addition , measurements of the same quantity sometimes make different assumptions for cross - feed branching ratios or resonant content , and hence should be converted to a common basis before being averaged .",
    "finally , a set of measurements can be internally inconsistent ( have a scale factor @xmath9 significantly larger than unity ) , in which case the nwa does not have a clear interpretation .",
    "the scope of this summary does not allow for a complete or comprehensive compilation of every new result since tau96 ; in particular , measurements inclusive of neutrals have been largely neglected .",
    "the reader is referred to the other presentations at this conference for up - to - date information on v / a spectral functions and the determination of @xmath10 in tau decay @xcite , 3@xmath11 sub - structure @xcite , and the impact of tau decays on hadronic contributions to @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there have been several hadronic branching fraction results published since tau96 , so consulting pdg98 @xcite is quite worthwhile .",
    "a systematic compilation with averages by specific decay appears along with a global fit . in the fit ,",
    "measured decays are expressed in terms of a set of exclusive basis decay modes , and the sum of the basis mode branching fraction is constrained to unity .",
    "the key observation by the pdg for tau decays in this edition is that there was only one basis mode ( @xmath14 ) that changed from pdg96 @xcite by more than one standard deviation . here",
    "the most important feature of tau branching fractions is one of gradually improving precision , internal consistency , and stability of results .",
    "`` deficits '' or `` problems '' in topological branching fraction vs. itemized decay mode sums , or significant internal disagreements in individual modes are mostly `` old news '' .",
    "the usually more precise recent measurements tend to be consistent with each other , and the troubles of the past seem to have been caused by systematic errors in the older , ( now ) less precise measurements",
    ".    nevertheless it may be useful to probe the limitations of the pdg98 conclusions",
    ". the global fitting procedure does not handle explicit correlations between measured branching fractions in different modes , even though such correlations have sometimes been given along with the measurement results .",
    "six measured decay modes totaling ( 0.150.05)% are explicitly ignored in the fit because they can not be expressed in terms of the basis modes . a special unofficial fit with a catch - all",
    "unconstrained `` dummy '' decay mode results in this mode being attributed with ( 0.50@xmath15)% branching fraction @xcite .",
    "hence the basis mode averages sum to less than unity , and in the official global fit , some branching fractions are pulled noticeably higher to compensate .",
    "there may be unmeasured modes with branching fraction sum at the @xmath160.5% level , or there may be problems with some of the measurements , or this may be a statistical fluctuation",
    ". however , there are other odd features to the global fit that have led the pdg to plan for a new fitter @xcite , one that will better address the stated goal of pdg to attain 0.1% internal consistency .",
    "those tau decays that proceed through the vector current are subject to tests of the conserved vector current and therefore comparison with electron - positron annihilation to the same final states . with the increase in amount and quality of tau data , in recent years tests of cvc",
    "have become limited by both the lack of comparably precise data from low energy @xmath17 colliders and the subtlety of systematic effects such as radiative corrections , separation of isoscalar components , and interference .",
    "this situation is improving somewhat with recent data from the cmd2 and snd experiments operating at the vepp-2 m collider at binp in novosibirsk .",
    "a compilation @xcite of the measured versus predicted branching fractions for vector - current modes shows a 2.4 standard deviation excess in the overall sum of tau rates compared with cvc prediction , with the excess concentrated in the two modes with largest branching fraction : @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : fhpi0nu ] , [ fig : f3hpi0nu ] ) . at this point",
    "it is too soon to tell whether this is significant given the experimental and theoretical subtleties involved .",

    "the older aleph measurement of @xmath39 @xcite is larger but consistent with the new cleo result ; although it should be noted that @xmath40 has not yet been measured directly .",
    "measured six pion branching fractions ( for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are found to be consistent with isospin symmetry once the axial - vector @xmath43 contributions have been subtracted @xcite . finally , new upper limits on tau decays with seven charged particles plus neutrals have been made by opal @xcite ( 1.8@xmath44 at 95%cl ) and cleo @xcite ( 2.4@xmath45 at 90%cl ) .",
    "much of the focus of new work on hadronic decays focused on modes with strange particles .",
