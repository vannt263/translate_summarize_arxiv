    "the fuse data for this investigation were obtained during the commissioning and early science operations stages of the fuse mission . an observation log can be found in table [ tab : fuselog ] .",
    "each observation was performed with the source centered in the @xmath71 aperture of the lif1 spectrograph channel . in many cases ,",
    "the lif2 channel was co - aligned well enough with the lif1 channel that a second set of spectra covering the 10001187   wavelength range was obtained .",
    "exposure times ranged from 3 ksec to 27 ksec for the magellanic cloud stars observed .",
    "the time - tagged photon event lists were processed through the standard fuse calibration pipeline ( calfuse ) available at the johns hopkins university .",
    "pipeline version 1.5.3 was used for the 1999 observations , and version 1.6.8 was used for the february 2000 observations .",
    "the photon lists were screened for valid data with constraints imposed for earth limb angle avoidance and passage through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "corrections for detector backgrounds , doppler shifts caused by spacecraft orbital motions , and geometrical distortions were applied ( sahnow et al . 2000 ; see also blair et al .",
    "no corrections were made for optical astigmatism aberrations since the data were obtained prior to completion of in - orbit focusing activities .",
    "no flatfield solutions existed at the time of these observations ; therefore , we compared the lif1 and lif2 spectra whenever possible to determine the significance of the observed features .",
    "the processed data have a nominal spectral resolution of 2025 km  s@xmath20(fwhm ) , with a relative wavelength dispersion solution accuracy of @xmath72 km  s@xmath20  ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the zero point of the wavelength scale for each individual observation is poorly determined , although the absolute velocities of the material are not important for our purposes . when necessary , small velocity shifts were applied to individual spectral lines to ensure that the line strength comparisons were judged over a common velocity scale . in particular , the lines at 1142 , 1143 , and",
    "1144   were systematically shifted by @xmath74 km  s@xmath20with respect to those at 1112 , 1121 , and 1125   using the dispersion solution applied to the data used in this work .",

    "these spectra represent only data from the lif1 channel for each star .",
    "most of the narrow interstellar lines in this bandpass are due to fe@xmath1ii(see table [ tab : final ] ) .",
    "also present in these spectra are interstellar absorption from the lyman ( 0 - 0 ) band of molecular hydrogen ( near 1110.1 , 1112.5 , and 1115.5  ) , from at 1122.5  , and from a triplet of n@xmath1i  lines between 1134 and 1135  .",
    "these species are present in the milky way and the host galaxies of these stars , in some cases causing quite complex blending of the absorption .",
    "prominent stellar wind lines are also visible in this spectrum , particularly the strong p cygni profiles of @xmath481118.0 and 1128.0 and @xmath481122.5 and 1128.3 .",
    "we have measured equivalent widths of the fe@xmath1ii  lines in the spectra of all of the stars listed in table [ tab : fuselog ] in the same manner as described above for the ghrs data .",
    "the measured equivalent widths are summarized in table [ tab : fuseeqw ] . for gas arising in the lmc or smc , many of the fe@xmath1ii  lines with well - determined @xmath0-values are blended or in regions of uncertain continuum placement .",
    "hence , we only present the equivalent widths of absorption lines arising from gas in the milky way .",
    "the values in table [ tab : fuseeqw ] are averages of the equivalent widths measured in the lif1b and lif2a detector segments ( where the latter were available ) .",
    "when comparing spectra taken through the lif1 and lif2 channels , there are occasionally differences in the profiles of absorption lines in the two channels .",
    "this seems to be associated with the greater degree of fixed pattern noise in the lif2a channel .",
    "typically these profile differences result in large discrepancies in the measured equivalent widths between the two channels . in cases where the lif1 and lif2 measurements differ by more than @xmath75 ,",
    "we have discarded the measurements from both channels .",

    "the empirically - derived oscillator strengths of the remaining three lines , however , differ significantly from the theoretical values . of these",
    ", the 1121.975   transition is the most prone to systematic uncertainties in the curve of growth fitting technique .",
    "its strength places it between the 1125 and 1144   transitions .",
    "it is somewhat sensitive to the adopted @xmath51-value , which is determined in large part by the strong 1144   transition .",
    "this could , for sightlines whose curves of growth depart strongly from the single - component , doppler - broadened model assumed here , potentially cause systematic uncertainties in our @xmath0-value determination . furthermore , because we only measure one line stronger than the 1121   transition , the determination of @xmath51-values could be skewed by systematics in the measurement of the strong 1144 line .",
    "the good agreement of the three ghrs/_copernicus_determinations of @xmath77 , which are quite secure , with the majority of the _ fuse _",
    "determinations suggests these systematics play a minor role .",
    "systematics of this sort are likely of order @xmath78 given the the agreement of the _ fuse _  and ghrs/_copernicus_determinations .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are likely small for the weaker 1112 , 1127 , and 1142   transitions , which all fall on or near the linear part of the curve of growth for the sightlines studied . in these cases",
    "the systematics associated with measurements of weak interstellar lines in _ fuse _  data are more important than the peculiarities of the fitting procedures .",
    "it should be noted that we have found no systematic differences across our sample of sightlines between the equivalent widths measured in the lif1 and lif2 channels for the weak 1112 , 1127 , and 1142   transitions .",
    "we have presented a self - consistent set of empirically - derived @xmath0-values for the fe@xmath1ii  transitions in the range @xmath79  , which are placed on an absolute scale by reference to the nuv laboratory measurements of mullman et al .",

    "this is shown graphically in figure [ fig : fratio ] , which displays the ratio of our best @xmath0-values to the theoretical @xmath0-values of ru98 versus their values . over a factor of 30 range in oscillator strengths we find good agreement ( within @xmath80 ) between the ru98 strengths and those derived here for 8 of the 11 lines studied in this work .",

    "to some extent the agreement of our work with these empirical studies is expected since these studies used curve of growth fitting methods ( which carry the heaviest weight in our averages ) for some of the same sightlines used here .",
    "we note that our derived @xmath0-value for @xmath141142 , @xmath81 , is in disagreement with that of cardelli & savage ( 1995 ) , who derive @xmath82 using ghrsobservations of the star @xmath83 scorpii .",

    "<S> we report empirical determinations of atomic oscillator strengths , or @xmath0-values , for 11 ground - state transitions of fe@xmath1ii  in the wavelength range @xmath2  . </S>",
    "<S> we use ultraviolet absorption line observations of interstellar material towards stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds taken with _ copernicus _ , the goddard high resolution spectrograph on - board the _ hubble space telescope _ , and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer_. we derive absolute oscillator strengths by a combination of the apparent optical depth , component fitting , and curve - of - growth fitting techniques . </S>",
    "<S> our derived oscillator strengths are generally in excellent agreement with recent theoretical calculations by raassen & uylings using the orthogonal operator technique . however , we identify three of the eleven transitions studied here whose @xmath0-values seem to be incompatible with these calculations , by as much as a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest revisions to these @xmath0-values based upon our analysis . </S>"
