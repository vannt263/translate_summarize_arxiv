    "alkaline - earth atoms share with metastable noble - gas atoms ( excluding he ) the property of interacting through anisotropic forces .",
    "however , as was shown quantitatively by derevianko @xcite , the dominant electric quadrupole - quadrupole interaction is noticeably stronger among alkaline - earth atoms : their large quadrupole moment is a consequence of the relatively diffuse spatial distribution of the excited p - electron ; the lack of spherical symmetry of a metastable noble - gas atom , on the other hand , is due to the hole in the compact valence shell , shielded by an orbiting electron of s - symmetry . since metastable alkaline - earth atoms  in contrast to noble - gas atoms  do not suffer from trap losses via the phenomenon of penning ionization @xcite , they offer the exciting prospect of quantum degenerate gases with pronounced anisotropic interatomic interactions .",

    "the numerical results in ref .",
    "@xcite are based on the assumption that s - wave scattering of two metastable alkaline - earth atoms in the low - field seeking state mentioned above is sensitive only to the rotationally invariant part of the interatomic interaction potential .",
    "however , as we shall show in this paper , that approximation is not justified in the case of relatively strong anisotropic coupling and does not lead to quantitatively accurate predictions .    in order to provide a systematic framework for describing anisotropic interactions , we present in sec .  [ sec2 ] a detailed tensorial analysis of the leading interatomic interaction operators .",
    "in particular , we show that the electric quadrupole - quadrupole operator transforms like a spherical tensor of rank four , and we decompose the electric dipole - dipole dispersion operator into tensors of rank zero , two , and four .",
    "similar tensorial ideas have been applied , for instance , to the anisotropic interactions between molecules @xcite and these were crucial to formally demonstrate the surprising existence of a vector interaction  a tensorial coupling of rank one  between a high - angular momentum rydberg electron and an anisotropic ionic core @xcite .",

    "[ sec3 ] ) . at interatomic distances of a few hundred bohr radii , electronic interaction energies and rotational energies are comparable .",
    "anisotropic interatomic interaction leads to coupling between different rotational quantum states , and the classification of a diatomic eigenstate using just a single rotational quantum number ceases to be meaningful .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to the discussion of a concrete example : metastable @xmath2sr .",
    "we have calculated all relevant long - range parameters ( magnetic dipole moment , electric quadrupole moment , and dispersion coefficients ) , treating the correlation between the two valence electrons in atomic @xmath2sr fully . using these parameters , which are in generally good agreement with the ones presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain adiabatic potential curves by diagonalizing the complete diatomic hamiltonian as a function of interatomic separation .",
    "our calculations reproduce the phenomenon of a potential well in the low - field seeking state , correlating at large interatomic separations to a rotational s - wave state and fully polarized atoms with highest zeeman energy . we make use of perturbation theory to shed light on how the interplay of the different physical operators generates the long - range molecular potential well .",
    "our analysis clarifies how the magnetic - field strength affects depth and location of the potential minimum .",
    "it also shows that , at interatomic distances in the vicinity of and below the potential well minimum , the eigenstate acquires an appreciable admixture of higher rotational quantum states .",
