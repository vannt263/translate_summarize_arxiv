    "rotating bose - einstein condensates display a wealth of interesting physics .",
    "one of the most striking achievements in this field is the observation of the abrikosov lattice of vortices  @xcite . with increasing rotation speed , it has been predicted that this lattice will melt and is replaced by more exotic quantum phases . when the rotation frequency is close to the harmonic trapping frequency and strong confinement",
    "is applied along the rotation axis , strongly correlated states belonging to the family of quantum hall liquid states should appear  @xcite .",
    "here we study bosonic atoms with only one hyperfine species ( i.e. spinless bosons ) in such regime .",
    "we assume that the temperature is low and the interactions are weak enough so that the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation is valid .",
    "the system may then display the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) as in two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) under strong magnetic field .",
    "the coulomb interaction is replaced by the @xmath1-wave scattering between the ultracold atoms .",
    "an analog of the filling factor @xmath2 for 2des can be defined  : indeed @xmath3 is the ratio between the number of atoms @xmath4 and the number of vortices @xmath5 that would be present in the system if it was a bose condensate .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 is the equivalent of the number of flux quanta in 2des systems . in this regime ,",
    "several fractions have been predicted .",
    "the most prominent one  @xcite appears at @xmath6 , for which the laughlin state is the exact ground state  @xcite .",
    "evidences for other fractions from the jain principal sequence @xmath7 such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been pointed out  @xcite and can be understood within the composite fermion theory@xcite .",
    "hierarchical quantum hall states are not the only interesting states that have been predicted below the critical filling factor where the lattice of vortices melt  @xcite . due to the bosonic statistics ,",
    "if we assume that the equivalent cyclotron gap is large enough , we can have filling factors greater than one and still stay entirely in the lll . within this hypothesis",
    ", even more exotic states should appear for fractions @xmath0 .",
    "the first one is the moore - read ( mr ) state  @xcite ( or pfaffian state ) that should occur  @xcite at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this state was first introduced to explain the fermionic fraction @xmath12 in 2des .",
    "higher @xmath13 values are associated to the so - called read - rezayi ( rr ) states  @xcite . because of the parafermionic behavior of these states , their excitations have surprising non - abelian statistics .",
    "so far , there are no well - established physical situation where these states play a role .",
    "the original suggestion by read and rezayi is that they may explain the incompressible states observed in the second landau level on the flanks of the elusive @xmath12 state .",
    "the rr states ( or clustered states ) in ultracold rotating atomic gases have been already the focus of several works .",
    "numerically exact diagonalizations of small systems have provided some hints of the presence of rr states . in the seminal work by cooper , wilkin and gunn",
    "@xcite , spectra in the torus geometry exhibit the special ground state degeneracy associated with the topology of the rr states and have excellent overlaps with the explicit rr trial wavefunctions . in the spherical geometry",
    "there is also a set of incompressible states with the special relationship between the flux and the number of particles of the rr states  @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the gap points to a non - zero value for the mr @xmath10 case , whereas the @xmath14 and @xmath15 results do not show clear evidence for a smooth thermodynamic limit . on the sphere geometry ,",
    "the overlap is excellent for the mr state and tend to a nonzero value as the system size increases  @xcite .",
    "a more recent work  @xcite has been done on the @xmath14 case .",
    "it shows that the overlap can be improved by adding a longer range dipole - dipole interaction    our purpose is to go beyond existing studies and look at size effects for fractions @xmath16 using exact diagonalizations on the sphere .",
    "we also check if the quasihole ground states are present at these filling factors by evaluating overlap between subspaces spanned by these states and the lowest energy excitations of the delta function interaction , @xmath1-wave scattering system .",
    "appearance of such quantum states with the correct degeneracy predicted by conformal field theory arguments is a strong hint of the validity of the rr state hypothesis .    in section [ parafermion ] ,",
    "we give an overview of the clustered states and their excitations while section [ cft ] is devoted to the conformal field theory ( cft ) formulation .",
    "section [ numerical ] is a brief description of the numerical method we use . in section [ ground ] , we give the results for the overlap of the ground states .",
    "we discuss how the system size , longer range or higher order n - body interaction impact on the overlap .",
    "section [ excitations ] is devoted to the quasihole excitations .",
    "in addition to the overlap values , we also give numerical evaluation of quasihole degeneracy on sphere for fractions @xmath17 and compare them to a formula due to ardonne  @xcite to check the validity of the conformal field theory approach .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we use the disk geometry in this section . in the symmetric gauge ,",
    "the lll one - body wave functions are given by  :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and we take the magnetic length @xmath20 to be equal to unity . any @xmath4-body wave function of particles in the lll can be written as a polynomial @xmath21 in the particle @xmath22 coordinates  :    @xmath23    from now on , we drop the global gaussian factor .",
    "the @xmath13-type rr state is the exact zero energy ground state of the pure @xmath24-body @xmath25-function interaction hamiltonian  :    @xmath26    the corresponding wave function can be written@xcite  : @xmath27 where @xmath28 the sum is over all permutations @xmath29 of @xmath4 elements such that @xmath30 . the number of particles @xmath4 must be a multiple of @xmath13 .",
    "these states are also referred to as clustered states because the wavefunction ( [ parawavefunction ] ) vanishes when @xmath31 or more particles are at the same position .",
    "the @xmath13-type rr state is associated to the filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "each rr state is the zero - energy ground state of its corresponding hamiltonian with the smallest total angular momentum .",
    "the simplest case @xmath32 corresponds to the usual laughlin wave function  : @xmath33 and is the exact ground state for rotating bosons with @xmath1-wave scattering at @xmath6 whose effective hamiltonian is given by  : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath1-wave scattering length , @xmath36 is the characteristic length of the @xmath37 axis oscillator which is used for 2d confinement , and @xmath38 is the cyclotron rotation frequency .",
    "the case @xmath11 is the so called mr / pfaffian state .",
    "it can be rewritten as  : @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for the pfaffian defined as  : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a skew - symmetric @xmath43 matrix ( n even ) , the sum runs over all permutations of the index with n values and @xmath44 is the signature of the permutation .    if we deviate from the clustered state at filling factor @xmath45 by adding @xmath46 vortices ( or flux quanta in the 2des analog ) , quasihole excitations are generated .",
    "for each added vortex , @xmath13 quasiholes are nucleated .",
    "for the laughlin state , quasihole ground state wave functions can easily be obtained .",
    "any function of the form  : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a symmetric polynomial , corresponds to a zero - energy many quasihole state . for one quasihole at position @xmath49 ,",
    "the polynomial @xmath48 is just @xmath50 .",
    "read and rezayi have also obtained an explicit formula in the case of the mr state@xcite for two quasiholes at positions @xmath49 and @xmath51  : @xmath52 with @xmath53 . in the general case , the quasihole ground states can be written down using the cft formulation .",
    "this formalism also reveals their non - abelian statistics .",
    "there is an elegant way to introduce rr states involving cft@xcite .",
    "the key idea@xcite is to express the wave function as a correlator using the algebra of the @xmath54 parafermions@xcite .",
    "this algebra is defined a set of field @xmath55 obeying the following operator product expansion ( ope )  : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath59 is the conformal weight of the field @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the theory central charge and @xmath62 are numerical coefficients .",
    "the algebra of @xmath54 parafermions corresponds to the choice @xmath63 leading to the central charge @xmath64 and to uniquely determined @xmath62 coefficients .",
    "read and rezayi have shown that the following wave function  : @xmath65 is equivalent to expression . one can easily show that this expression vanishes quadratically as @xmath31 particles go to the same point using the ope rules above . within this formalism , it has been argued that the zero energy quasihole states can be built by inserting a spin field for each quasihole into the correlator of . for @xmath11 , this spin field",
    "@xmath29 is equivalent to the magnetization operator of the ising model . in the ising case ,",
    "the fusion rules are given by  : @xmath66 for @xmath67 quasiholes , the candidate state is then  : @xmath68 the fusion rule leads to a non - trivial degeneracy of the quasihole states  : there are @xmath69 ways to fuse the spin operators leading to a non zero correlator , thus giving as many different wavefunctions .",
    "this so - called intrinsic degeneracy is the key of non - abelian statistics  : exchanging two quasihole coordinates of a given quasihole state will result in a linear combination of states of the same family instead of an overall multiplicative phase factor . in the case of the spherical geometry that we will discuss later , an additional ( extrinsic ) degeneracy arise from the laughlin - like part of eq .. determining the multiplet decomposition of quasihole states in such a case is a challenging task  @xcite and constitutes a non - trivial check of the cft approach when compared to numerical calculations .",
    "more details will be given in section [ excitations ] .",
    "for @xmath70 , the spin field that we have introduced has to be replaced by one of the primary field operators of the @xmath54 parafermion algebra .",
    "the guess is to use the operator @xmath71 which minimizes the charge of the quasiholes .",
    "the wavefunction can then be generalized to  : @xmath72 the fusion rules involving @xmath71 are more complex  @xcite but the same remarks as for the @xmath11 case apply , meaning they lead to non - abelian statistics .",
    "notice that for @xmath73 , such states have been proposed to be a robust way to implement quantum computation@xcite .",
    "we use exact diagonalizations to study if the rr states are relevant to the physics of the fast rotating boson gases at filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "numerical calculations can be done on various geometry such as the disk , the torus or the sphere .",
    "the disk geometry is plagued by edge effects and thus closed geometries are preferred when dealing with bulk properties . in this paper ,",
    "all calculations are done on the spherical geometry @xcite . due to the @xmath74 symmetry",
    ", states can be classified with respect to their total angular momentum @xmath75 and its projection along one axis @xmath76 .",
    "solutions of the one - body problem are given by the monopole harmonics  @xcite ( a generalization of the spherical harmonics ) , which take the following form in the lll  : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the projection of the angular momentum , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the spinor components in spherical coordinates  : @xmath82 the radius @xmath83 of the sphere is related to the number of vortices ( or flux quanta in the 2des language ) @xmath5 that pierce it  : @xmath84 the one particle angular momentum @xmath85 is such that @xmath86 . due to sphere topology , the relation between the number of particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a given fraction is linear with a non - zero shift .",
    "for each trial wavefunction for a given fraction , there is a unique shift , which is a characteristic of the quantum hall state . in the case of parafermionic states ,",
    "the relation between the magnetic flux and the number of particles is given by  : @xmath87 this can be deduced from the expression of the ( [ parawavefunction ] ) on the sphere by applying a stereographic projection .",
    "formally , we just have to drop the gaussian factor and make the substitution  : @xmath88    the two - body interaction is completely characterized by a set of @xmath89 numbers @xmath90 called the pseudo - potentials  @xcite .",
    "the integer @xmath91 is the _ relative _ angular momentum between the two particles . for spinless bosons ,",
    "only even-@xmath91 potentials are relevant .",
    "@xmath1-wave scattering interaction corresponds to the case where all pseudo - potentials are equal to zero except @xmath92 .",
    "longer range interactions involve additional pseudopotentials , the next one for spinless bosons being @xmath93 .",
    "thus , adding some @xmath93 component allows to test the effect of longer range interactions .",
    "comparison between the rr states or their quasihole excitations with the true ground states is achieved by computing overlaps . for two states",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 , the overlap is defined as @xmath96 . this definition can be extended to the case of subspaces of same dimension @xmath4 and spanned by vector sets @xmath97 and @xmath98  : latexmath:[\\ ] ] and is equal to zero if @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath105 is the number of quasiholes .",
    "it is linked to the number of added quantum fluxes @xmath46 by the relation @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126 is the identity dimensional matrix and @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the cartan matrix of the @xmath129 algebra  :      @xmath131 is a vector of @xmath132 non - negative integer such that @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a multiple of @xmath13 .",
    "when we look at a system of @xmath4 bosons , we are only interested in the values @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath134 has to be understood as the number of unclustered bosons . in the simplest case @xmath11",
    ", @xmath136 corresponds to the number of parafermionic fields that appear when using ope .",
    "each @xmath112-polynomial in front of given @xmath137 monomial , is associated to the multiplet decomposition of the intrinsic degeneracy of a given @xmath134 value .",
    "it will be of the form  : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a global shift of the @xmath112 power and @xmath140 is the number of multiplet of momentum @xmath141 .",
    "thus the multiplet decomposition of the intrinsic degeneracy can be directly read - out from the polynomial expression .",
    "for example , let evaluate ( [ ardonneformula ] ) for @xmath142 , for the @xmath143 bosons case , we only need the partial development given in ( [ ardonneformulaexample ] ) up to @xmath144  : @xmath145 thus the multiplet decomposition for the intrinsic degeneracy is one singlet @xmath102 for @xmath146 , one multiplet @xmath147 for @xmath148 and one singlet @xmath102 for @xmath149 .",
    "the extrinsic part gives the following multiplet : one singlet @xmath102 for @xmath149 , one multiplet @xmath150 for @xmath148 , one multiplet for @xmath151 for @xmath146 . using the standard momentum addition rules",
