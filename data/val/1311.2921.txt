    "a long - standing question is how this restoration manifests itself in the hadron spectrum , _ i.e. _ , what its observable consequences are .",
    "dilepton data from ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics )  @xcite are now providing strong evidence that the @xmath1 resonance  melts \" when the system passes through the pseudo - critical region  @xcite , while experimental access to the in - medium @xmath4 spectral functions ( e.g. , via @xmath7 ) remains elusive .",
    "thus , to test whether the @xmath1 melting in the vector channel signals chiral restoration , a theoretical evaluation of the in - medium axialvector spectral function is needed .",
    "a straightforward approach to calculate the in - medium axialvector spectral function , by using a chiral lagrangian paralleling the treatment of the @xmath1 meson , turns out to be challenging  @xcite .",
    "for example , the widely used scheme of implementing the @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons into the pion lagrangian through a local gauging procedure causes considerable problems in describing the vacuum spectral functions as measured in hadronic @xmath0 decays  @xcite , which led some groups to abandon the local gauging procedure  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt a more modest approach to this problem , by utilizing in - medium sum rules .",
    "specifically , we adopt the well - known weinberg sum rules ( wsrs )  @xcite which relate ( moments of ) the difference between vector and axialvector spectral functions to operators signifying sbcs . using available calculations of the in - medium @xmath1 spectral function together with temperature dependent order parameters as an input , we ask whether _ a _ ( not necessarily _ the _ ) axialvector spectral function can be found to satisfy the in - medium sum rules . to tighten our constraints , we simultaneously employ finite - temperature qcd sum rules ( qcdsrs )  @xcite in vector and axialvector channels , which additionally involve chirally invariant condensates .",
    "related works have been carried out , e.g. , in the low - temperature limit  @xcite , for heavy - quark channels  @xcite , or focusing on chirally odd condensates in the vector channel only  @xcite .",
    "the present analysis builds on our previous work  @xcite where qcd and weinberg sum rules have been tested in vacuum with vector and axialvector spectral functions that accurately fit hadronic @xmath0-decays .",
    "the combination of four wsrs turned out be a rather sensitive probe of the spectral functions , allowing , _",

    "this makes for a promising tool at finite temperature ( @xmath9 ) , aided by an experimentally tested in - medium vector spectral function and in - medium condensates from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . in the absence of reliable microscopic models for the @xmath4 and the excited states , the price to pay is the _ a priori _ unknown in - medium behavior of these states .",
    "however , with guidance from model - independent chiral mixing theorems to constrain the @xmath9 dependence of the higher states , one can still hope for a sensitive test of the in - medium @xmath4 spectral function , and to gain novel insights into ( the approach to ) chiral restoration in the @xmath10 chiral multiplet .",

    "we define pertinent ratios @xmath69 .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows .",
    "we first evaluate the qcdsr for the vector channel . with a small reduction in the vector dominance coupling , we find acceptable @xmath70 values ranging from 0.43% to 0.67% for all @xmath9=0 - 170mev ( cf .  tab  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "this is a nontrivial result by itself . for the axialvector channel , the qcdsrs and two wsrs",
    "are used simultaneously to search for in - medium @xmath4 parameters which minimize @xmath71 while requiring a smooth @xmath9 dependence .",
    "the thus obtained finite-@xmath9 axialvector spectral functions are shown in fig .",

    ", the percentage deviation of wsr-1 and wsr-2 is below 0.1% , and @xmath72 remains below 0.6% .",
    "deviations of wsr-3 are much larger , but comparable to the vacuum up to @xmath9@xmath6150mev . at @xmath9=160 and especially 170mev , the magnitude of the rhss is small and enters into the denominator of @xmath73 , thus greatly magnifying residual deviations .",
    "the @xmath74 measures decrease monotonically with @xmath9 suggesting acceptable deviations even for wsr-3 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our spectral functions are compatible with both qcdsrs and wsrs .    to probe the uncertainties in our method , we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : axialband ] ranges of axialvector spectral functions with relaxed constraints , at an intermediate temperature of @xmath9=150mev .",
    "the dashed lines border a regime of spectral functions which are obtained by only requiring @xmath72=1% for the axialvector qcdsr ( the band could be larger if all spectral functions with @xmath72@xmath751% were included ) . from this collection of curves , we then select those whose agreement with wsr1 is within @xmath76 , producing a much narrower ( shaded ) region bordered by dotted lines .",

    "a visual inspection of the in - medium spectral functions supports the trend toward restoration , cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] : the @xmath4 peak gradually merges into the @xmath1 while the excited states degenerate somewhat earlier through chiral mixing .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath4 merging is largely dictated by the wsrs , but the concrete shape close to chiral restoration is more sensitive to the qcdsrs . note that our analysis not only complies with a  trivial \" degeneracy at the restoration point , but rather provides a systematic temperature evolution , starting from the vacuum , compatible with current best estimates for the @xmath9 dependent chiral order parameters and condensates ( at @xmath9=170mev , our condensates are close to zero , undershooting the lqcd data for the 2-quark condensate ; our axialvector spectral function at this temperature is thus more of an illustration of the expected degeneracy at higher @xmath9 where @xmath79@xmath60 ) .",
    "the in - medium @xmath4 mass shift is consistent with a leading @xmath80 behavior , in line with model - independent constraints from the chiral lagrangian .",
    "our analysis also suggests that the approach toward restoration  burns off \" the chiral mass splitting between the @xmath1 and @xmath4 , while  bare \" masses of @xmath81@xmath60.8gev essentially persist , similar to ref .",
    "the objective of this work was to test whether in - medium vector spectral functions which describe dilepton data in heavy - ion collisions are compatible with chiral symmetry restoration . toward this end , we deployed qcd and weinberg sum rules in a combined analysis of vector and axialvector spectral functions , using lattice - qcd and the hadron resonance gas to estimate the in - medium condensates and chiral order parameters , and chiral mixing to treat the @xmath9 dependence of excited states .",
    "we first found that the qcdsr in the vector channel is satisfied with a small ( order 5% ) amendment of vector dominance .",
    "we then introduced a 4-parameter ansatz for the in - medium @xmath4 spectral function and found that a smooth reduction of its mass ( approaching the @xmath1 mass ) and large increase in width ( accompanied by a low - mass shoulder ) can satisfy the axialvector qcdsr and 3 wsrs over the entire temperature range from @xmath9=0 - 170mev , ultimately merging with the vector channel .",
    "this establishes a direct connection between dileptons and chiral restoration , and thus the answer to the originally raised question is positive .",
