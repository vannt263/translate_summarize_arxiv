    "the aperiodic x - ray variability in seyfert active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been well - quantified over multiple timescales .",
    "seyfert broadband fluctuation power spectral density functions ( psds ) show characteristic breaks at temporal frequencies corresponding to timescales of a few days or less ( uttley , m@xmath4hardy & papadakis 2002 , markowitz et al .",
    "2003 , m@xmath4hardy et al .  2004 ) .",
    "markowitz et al .  ( 2003 ) and m@xmath4hardy et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have shown that the psd break timescales measured so far are consistent with scaling roughly linearly with black hole mass @xmath5 .",
    "remarkably , the mass  timescale relation is consistent with extrapolation to stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) , and agn and bhxrb broadband psd shapes are similar , suggesting that a similar variability process is at work over at least 6 decades in black hole mass .    in bhxrbs , the psd shape and characteristic break timescales are known to correlate with the x - ray spectral state , which is thought to depend on the global accretion rate relative to eddington , @xmath6 ( e.g. see reviews by mcclintock & remillard 2003 , van der klis 2004 ) . in general , shorter characteristic timescales are correlated with steeper x - ray power - law components and stronger thermal emission and reflection components , which suggests a model where the inner edge of the accretion disk moves inwards at higher accretion rates and hence characteristic timescales become shorter ( e.g. gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ) .",
    "the difference in characteristic timescales is clear when comparing the psds of the low / hard spectral state , in which psd breaks appear at a few hz , with the high / soft state , where a similar steepening occurs at higher frequencies @xmath7  hz ( e.g. churazov , gilfanov & revnivstev 2001 ) .",
    "recently , m@xmath4hardy et al .  (",
    "2004 ) noted that higher accretion rate narrow line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) agn appear to have relatively shorter psd break timescales for their black hole mass than normal seyferts ( and also appear most similar to the psds of bhxrbs in the high / soft state , m@xmath4hardy et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "since nls1 are thought to accrete at high rates ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) , this observation would suggest that characteristic timescales in agn follow a similar dependence on accretion rate to those in bhxrbs .",
    "however , the accretion rates of agn with good - quality psds measured so far are estimated to be a few per cent of eddington or greater . since the low / hard  high / soft state transition in bhxrbs seems to occur at @xmath8 of eddington ( maccarone 2003 ) , it is not yet clear whether any agn observed so far should be in the low / hard state ( with the possible exception of ngc  3783 , markowitz et al .",
    "therefore , in order to better test the analogy with bhxrbs and search for evidence of different states in agn , it is useful to measure the psds of x - ray light curves of agn accreting at significantly lower rates than the existing sample , which may be analogues of bhxrbs in the low / hard state .    in this letter , we make a first step towards measuring a high - quality psd for a low - accretion rate agn , by measuring a preliminary psd for the llagn ngc  4258 ( @xmath6@xmath910@xmath10 , e.g. , lasota et al .",
    "1996 ) , using monitoring data obtained in 19972000 by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) . ngc  4258 s black hole mass of @xmath0  @xmath1 is highly accurately measured via vlbi studies of its water megamaser ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 , herrnstein et al .",
    "1999 ) , allowing us to make an accurate comparison with the psd expected from both high / soft and low / hard accretion states .",
    "we constructed a high - dynamic - range psd for ngc  4258 by combining monitoring on complementary timescales ( e.g. , edelson & nandra 1999 ) .",
    "ngc  4258 was monitored regularly once every 23 days by _ rxte _  from 1997 dec 27 to 2000 mar 1 ( `` long - term '' monitoring ) .",
    "each visit lasted @xmath91  ksec .",
    "there was also intensive , simultaneous _",
    "rxte _   and _ asca _  monitoring during 2000 may 1520 , when the source was observed every orbit ( `` short - term '' monitoring ) . for consistency",
    "we only use the short - term _ rxte _  pca data here , binned to 5760  s ( i.e. single orbit ) intervals , but note that the 210  kev _ asca _  short - term light curve is consistent with the _ rxte _  light curve .",
    "data were obtained from _ rxte _",
    "s proportional counter array ( pca ) , using standard extraction methods and selection criteria appropriate for faint sources ( see markowitz et al .",
    "2003 for further details ) .",
    "light curves were generated over the 210 kev bandpass .",
    "all count rates quoted herein are normalized to 1 proportional counter unit ( pcu ) .",
    "the light curves are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "one can see that ngc  4258 displays minimal variability on short timescales ; other observations ( e.g. , pietsch & read 2002 ) also show minimal variability on @xmath11day timescales .",
    "in contrast , there is strong variability on long timescales . the fractional variability amplitude @xmath12 , as defined in e.g. , vaughan et al .  ( 2003 ) ,",
    "is 4.2 @xmath13 0.8 @xmath3 and 27.9 @xmath13 0.2 @xmath3 for the short- and long - term light curves , respectively account for observational noise only , not intrinsic stochastic variability . ] .",
    "the 210 kev x - ray emission is dominated by the direct nuclear emission in this source ( e.g. , fiore et al .",
    "variability due solely to variations in the intrinsic column density is negligible , as the column density is not strongly variable , even on timescales of years ( risaliti , elvis & nicastro 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , a plot of the binned 24 kev flux versus the 710 kev flux ( which , for brevity , we do not show here ) shows a continuous , virtually linear distribution of points , suggesting a lack of strong absorption events during the monitoring .",
    "we used the psresp monte carlo method of uttley et al .",
    "2002 ( and see markowitz et al .",
    "2003 ) to constrain the shape of the psd .",
    "monte carlo simulations are required to take account of aliasing effects due to sparse and/or irregular sampling , which distorts the psd shape .",
    "furthermore , simulations are essential to properly determine confidence limits and goodness of fit of models while using the full dynamic range of the psd , since the lowest frequencies in the psds of the long- and short - term light curves are not well - sampled enough to allow standard , gaussian errors to be assigned to the psd .",
    "the method is fully described in uttley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , markowitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and see also m@xmath4hardy ( 2004 ) .",
    "the long- and short - term psds spanned the temporal frequency ranges @xmath14@xmath15  hz and @xmath16@xmath17  hz respectively .",
    "the power due to poisson noise over the 210  kev bandpass was 860 hz@xmath18 and 8.3 hz@xmath18 for the long- and short - term psds , respectively .    to constrain the location of any psd break , we employed a broken power law model of the form @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where the normalization @xmath21 is the psd amplitude at the break frequency @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 is the high frequency power law slope , with the constraint @xmath24 .",
    "this simple model provides a good description of the psds of seyfert galaxies measured so far , with psd breaks detected in nine of those agn .",
    "the range of @xmath23 tested was 1.02.3 in increments of 0.1 .",
    "break frequencies were tested from @xmath25@xmath26  hz , in multiplicative steps of 1.5 .",
    "the best - fitting model is one with a break at @xmath27  hz , although an unbroken power - law is also formally acceptable ( i.e. the break frequency could lie out of the observed range ) .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath28 , @xmath29  hz@xmath18 , and the  rejection probability \" ( corresponding to the fraction of simulated psd sets which are a better fit to the assumed model than the real data ) is 0.43 , i.e. the model is formally acceptable .",
    "contour plots showing the rejection probabilities for a given @xmath23 and @xmath30 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "on the contour plot we also show the expected break frequencies assuming linear scaling with mass from typical values of break timescale in the low / hard and high / soft states of the bhxrb cyg  x-1 ( assuming a 10  @xmath1 black hole in cyg  x-1 , e.g. , herrero et al .",
    "1995 , and the well - determined maser mass of @xmath31  @xmath1 in ngc  4258 ) .",
    "the high / soft state break frequency ( corresponding to 4.5 d ) is ruled out at @xmath290% confidence , while the low / hard state break ( @xmath945 d ) is acceptable at this level of confidence .",
    "fiore et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report a 1998 december _ bepposax _ 3 - 10  kev light curve of ngc  4258 which shows almost a factor 2 change in flux in one day .",
    "this behavior is atypical of the source , which shows much smaller variations on timescales of a few days in both the _ rxte _ long - term monitoring and the much more intensive monitoring .",
    "we investigated whether this relatively large variation in the _ bepposax _ observation was consistent with the psd derived from _",
    "rxte _ monitoring , by including the _ bepposax _ light curve ( obtained directly from the public archive ) in our fits .",
    "we find that the rejection probability for the broken power - law psd is increased to 0.77 , but the overall confidence contours for @xmath30 and @xmath23 are only made marginally wider .",
    "we conclude that the _ bepposax _ light curve is consistent with the _ rxte _ _ psd _ and simply represents a statistical outlier in the stochastic variability process .",
    "the psd of the llagn ngc  4258 does indeed appear to be better explained by scaling from a low / hard state psd than from a high / soft state psd , _ unlike _ the psds of some of the seyfert galaxies measured so far which rule out a low / hard state interpretation and are consistent with a high / soft state interpretation ( e.g. ngc  4051 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , m@xmath4hardy et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ; ngc  3227 , uttley & m@xmath4hardy 2005 ) . to demonstrate this difference in the psds",
    ", we show in figure 3 a relatively model - independent comparison between the psd of ngc  4258 and that of a normal seyfert with nearly identical black hole mass , ngc  3516 ( @xmath5 = 4.3@xmath131.5  @xmath32  10@xmath33  @xmath1 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , together with the psds of cyg  x-1 in low / hard and high / soft states for further comparison .",
    "ngc  3516 s accretion rate is likely @xmath95@xmath3 of eddington , given its 210 kev luminosity of 10@xmath34 erg s@xmath18 and assuming the x - ray - to - bolometric luminosity scaling of padovani & rafanelli ( 1988 ) . within the errors , the psd break timescale of ngc  3516 is more consistent with linearly scaling from the high - frequency break of cyg x-1 in the high / soft state , though scaling from the low / hard state can not be ruled out . from the figure , although its amplitude at low frequencies is similar to that of ngc  3516 , ngc  4258 s psd is consistent with being shifted downward in temporal frequency by a factor of @xmath9100 relative to ngc  3516 s psd .",
    "given the similarity in black hole mass between the two objects and the overlapping temporal - frequency range of the psds , the fact that a psd break was unambiguously detected in the psd of ngc  3516 but not in that of ngc  4258 reinforces this notion .",
    "furthermore , the fact that ngc  4258 shows similar levels of long - timescale variability to normal seyferts of comparable mass ( @xmath12 @xmath9 30@xmath3 , markowitz & edelson 2004 ) rules out the possibility that the normalization of ngc  4258 s psd is significantly lower compared to that for normal seyferts",
    ". the psds are thus consistent with the notion that for a given mass , a psd shifted towards relatively lower temporal frequencies is associated with a lower accretion rate .",
    "ngc  4258 , and by extension , other llagn , may thus be a low accretion rate version of normal seyferts , as far as x - ray continuum variability is concerned .",
    "we have shown that the psd of ngc  4258 is consistent with having the same shape and normalization as the psds of more - luminous seyfert galaxies , but with a break on longer timescales than expected by scaling from the high / soft state of cyg  x-1 , unlike a seyfert galaxy with similar mass , ngc  3516 . from a purely phenomenological point of view",
    ", this result may help to explain the differences in short - term ( @xmath35day ) variability amplitude between llagn and seyfert galaxies reported by ptak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who showed that llagn do not follow the well - known anticorrelation between x - ray luminosity and short - term variability amplitude which is shown by normal seyferts ( e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) , but instead populate the low - luminosity , low - variability part of the variance - luminosity diagram .",
    "ngc  4258 also shows a very low variability amplitude on short timescales , and our psd suggests that this is due to a long break timescale in this agn , rather than a low overall normalization of the psd .",
    "the same might also be true of other llagn .",
    "the comparison with break - timescale expected from mass - scaling of the timescales from cyg  x-1 , and the comparison with the psd of ngc  3516 , both suggest that the break timescale in ngc  4258 is intrinsically longer ( given its mass ) than in more luminous agn",
    ". this difference may reflect the low accretion rate in ngc  4258 .",
    "ngc  4258 appears to be consistent with scaling from the low / hard state psd of cyg  x-1 , although it is possible that the break timescale is even longer than that scaling would suggest .",
    "an analogy with other bhxrbs which display a larger range of @xmath6 than cyg x-1 supports this possibility .",
    "for example in the outburst decays of transient bhxrb candidates , after transition from the high / soft spectral state to the low / hard spectral state , there is evidence that psd timescales , particularly qpos , continue to migrate towards lower frequencies as the luminosity and accretion rate of the source decrease and the source approaches quiescence ( van der klis 2004 , kalemci et al .",
    "2004 , rodriguez et al .",
    "2004 , nowak , wilms & dove 2002 ) .    despite the consistency with bhxrb behavior",
    ", it is still not clear whether the dependency of the mass  timescale relation on agn accretion rate is a continuous scaling , or if it exists in the form of a high vs.  low accretion rate dichotomy akin to that seen in bhxrbs .",
    "however , there are differences in the observed energy - spectral features of llagn and normal seyferts which are suggestive of differing accretion modes in the two classes of objects .",
    "specifically , llagn are more radio loud compared to normal seyferts , and the so - called optical / uv `` big blue bump '' in normal seyferts , inferred to be thermal accretion disk emission , is absent in llagn ( ho 1999 ) .",
    "similar discrepancies arise when comparing the spectral energy distributions of low / hard and high / soft - state bhxrbs ( though in this case , due to the much smaller , hotter disks of bhxrbs , the thermal emission appears in the x - ray band ) .",
    "nagar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have suggested that both llagn and low / hard state bhxrbs are low - efficiency accreting sources , as both classes of objects are often associated with strong radio jet emission and low levels of thermal disk emission .",
    "higher - efficiency accreting sources , namely normal seyferts and high / soft - state bhxrbs , meanwhile , usually lack strong radio emission but have a strong disk signature , with the supermassive systems also having gas - rich nuclei .",
    "additionally , a fundamental plane between @xmath5 and x - ray and radio luminosities is seen in both stellar - mass and supermassive systems ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) . however , this relation breaks down for high - state objects ; radio power is reduced e.g. , for high / soft state bhxrbs and normal seyferts ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ; maccarone , gallo & fender 2003 ) , further supporting the notion of a similar dichotomy of states for both agn and bhxrbs . finally , based on the distributions of @xmath5 and bolometric luminosities , jester ( 2005 )",
    "has suggested that in agn , there is tentative evidence for the existence of a critical accretion rate , @xmath6 @xmath9 0.01 , which separates high- and low - efficiency accretion modes .",
    "the number of low - efficiency accreting sources in that sample was small , but all were llagn .    for llagn and low / hard - state bhxrbs , the longer variability timescales for a given mass , reduced emission from the optically thick , radiatively - efficient disk , and relative weakness of fe k@xmath36 emission ( e.g. , pietsch & read 2002 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ) are all consistent with the suggestion that the inner accretion disk is truncated , possibly existing at smaller radii as an optically thin , radiatively inefficient , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "adaf models have frequently been invoked to explain the spectral energy distributions in ngc  4258 and other llagn ( e.g. , yuan et al .  2002 ) .",
    "as one example , one popular geometrical model for the accretion configuration is the so - called `` sphere + disk '' model of dove et al .  ( 1997 ) and esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) .",
    "this model features a geometrically - thick , sometimes spherical , adaf flow , at the innermost radii , surrounded by a radiatively efficient , geometrically thin disk .",
    "the transition radius between the adaf and thin disk appears at relatively larger radii for lower accretion rates .",
    "also , considerations of how an adaf / coronal accretion flow can form from evaporation of the optically thick disk have suggested that the inner disk may evaporate completely into an optically - thin flow if the accretion rate transitions from above to below a critical accretion rate ( raska & czerny 2001 ; meyer - hofmeister & meyer 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "further progress in this area can be made by firmly establishing whether such a critical accretion rate exists in agn and if it is indeed responsible for the dominance of high- or low - efficiency accretion modes as a function of accretion rate .",
    "measuring psd breaks for a larger number of agn , including llagn , is also necessary to critically test the dependence of the mass  timescale relation on accretion rate .",
    "clarification of these issues in agn as well as in bhxrbs will help to unify the behavior of stellar - mass and supermassive accreting black holes .",
    "the authors acknowledge useful discussions with j.  cannizzo . this work has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa goddard space flight center , and the nasa@xmath37ipac extragalactic database which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
