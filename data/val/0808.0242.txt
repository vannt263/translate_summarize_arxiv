    "recently , quantum phase transition @xcite has received great attention due to its intimate correlation to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , especially to the concept of quantum entanglement @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for a comprehensive review ) . in general the quantum phase transition",
    "happens when the degeneracy of the ground states occurs , which can not be characterized completely by the pattern of symmetry broken ( order parameters of some kind ) .",
    "instead the universal quantum order or topological order is needed for the description of properties of the ground state in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "recently the connection between the geometric phase of the ground state and the quantum criticality has been displayed in spin - chain systems by displaying the singularity of the geometric phase closed to the critical points @xcite .",
    "moreover in ref @xcite the author showed that the scaling behavior of the geometric phase of the ground state near the critical points can also display the universal class of the phase transitions .",
    "many works have been devoted to this interesting issue @xcite ( or see ref.@xcite for a review ) .    although great progresses has been made in the understanding of quantum phase transition from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , an important question is not yet resolved : whether there exists a universal way to characterize the different phases and their boundaries .",
    "more specifically , could the geometric phase of the ground state in many - body systems serve this purpose ?",
    "this conjecture is natural since the quantum phase transition generally emerges from the degeneracy of the ground state in many - body systems .",
    "geometric phase as a measurement of the curvature of the hilbert space , could mark the fantastic changes of the ground state when degeneracy happens .",
    "however the critical point is how to obtain the geometric phase of the ground state .",
    "the earlier method is to impose a local rotation about some special orientations , as has been done in @xcite . in our own viewpoints ,",
    "the connection built by this method is fragile ; the geometric phase is trivial when the system is symmetrical about this rotation .",
    "recently the differential information - geometry analysis of quantum fidelity in many - body systems displayed the intimate correlation between quantum phase transition and the singularity of fidelity between the states across the transition point @xcite . in these papers the quantum geometric tensor , which is intimately related to the degeneracy of the ground state , was introduced for the determination of the fidelity . as shown in these papers , the imaginary part of this tensor actually described the curvature two - form whose holonomy is the berry phase , and the degeneracy of the ground state would induce the singularity of fidelity @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion , it seems not transparent to directly define the geometric phase in this coupling - parameter space since a cyclic evolution may be difficult to construct .",
    "moreover , the explicit expression for the ground state is necessary for the construction of this tensor , which in general is difficult .",
    "furthermore it is also unknown in the case where the degeneracy of the ground state is broken . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bargmann phase , a generalization of the berry phase , has also been constructed for detecting the phase transition in many - body systems .",
    "however the connection between degeneracy of the ground state and the bargmann phase was unclear in this case since there was a lack of simple interpretational underpinnings for the bargmann phase in terms of physical adiabatic processes @xcite .",
    "with respect to the points stated above , it is urgent to find a popular way for construction of geometric phase in many - body systems .",
    "for this purpose , a nonlocal operator -the twist operator- is introduced to obtain the geometric phase of the ground state in this paper .",
    "our calculation shows that the geometric phase , decided by the ground - state expectation value of the twist operator , can serve as the quantity to distinguish different phases and boundaries between them , as shown below .",
    "the general form for the twist operator can be written as in the lattice systems , @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath2 denotes the coordinates of lattice sites and @xmath3 is generally related to the physical quantities located at site @xmath2 , such as the total spin or charge , or particle number at site @xmath2 and so on .",
    "the twist operator was first introduced by lieb , schultz and mattis for the proof of gapless excitation in one - dimensional spin-1/2 chains@xcite .",
    "then resta pointed out that its ground state expectation was direct to the berry - phase theory of polarization in strongly correlated electron systems @xcite .",
    "moreover aligia found that the ground - state expectation value of the twist operator eq .",
    "allows one to discriminate conducting from nonconducting phase in the extended quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the ground - state expectation value , i.e. @xmath4 , has been shown the ability to detect the boundaries of different valence - bond - solid phases in spin chains @xcite . however these studies were implemented in some special examples and a general discussion was absent .",
    "moreover since the previous calculations were numerical or approximate , the details of @xmath5 adjacent to the phase transition points are unclear .",
    "hence it is of great interest to find the exact expression for @xmath5 , even for special cases .",
    "our paper serves this purpose , and the exact results can be found for a special case .",
    "it is of great interest to note that the twist operator @xmath5 actually creates a wave - like excitation since it rotates all the particles with a relative angle between the neighboring lattices @xmath6@xcite . under the large @xmath1 limit",
    "the ground state has an adiabatic variation , and its ground - state expectation value is exactly a geometric factor , of which an argument is the geometric phase .",
    "applying @xmath5 to the unique ground state , one obtains a low - lying excited state .",
    "the important quantity is the overlap between the ground state and this excited state , i.e. @xmath7 in which @xmath8 denotes the many - body ground state .",
    "in general @xmath9 is a complex number and its argument is just the geometric phase , determined by @xmath10=i \\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\phi{\\langle g(\\phi)|}\\partial_{\\phi}{|g(\\phi)\\rangle},\\ ] ] in which @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath12 in fact came from the continued deformation of the boundary condition of systems @xcite and then slightly related to the symmetry of the hamiltonian , this construction of the geometric phase is more popular than the previous method .",
    "an important character is that @xmath12 is related to the correlation functions for the ground state , and numerical evaluation could be implemented efficiently @xcite .",
    "it is an immediate speculation that @xmath9 and @xmath12 may be singular near the critical points , where the degeneracy of the ground state happens and the macroscopic properties of the system have fantastic changes .",
    "however , our findings are more subtle ; the exact calculations show an unexpected ability for @xmath12 or @xmath9 to distinguish the different phases in many - body systems ; one case is that @xmath9 tends to be zero and then @xmath12 is ill - defined when one approaches the phase transition points , in which the degeneracy of the ground state happens .",
    "the other is that @xmath12 has different values for different phases and displays the singularity at the transition points , where no degeneracy happens .",
    "the physical reason , as shown in the following discussions , is directly related to the energy gap above the ground state .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the exact expression of @xmath9 and the geometric phase @xmath12 are presented in the two - band model for a special case , in which the ground state is the filled fermi sea . in sec .",
    "iii , two representative examples are provided for the demonstration of this connection .",
    "one is the @xmath13-dimensional free - fermion model , in which there are quantum phase transitions originated from the ground - state - energy degeneracy .",
    "the other example is the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model , in which the energy gap is non - vanishing at the quantum phase transition points and a topological order , defined by the geometric phase @xmath12 , provides a clear description of the phase diagram for this model .",
    "consider the one - dimensional ( 1d ) translational invariant hamiltonian with two bands separated by a finite gap @xcite , @xmath14 in which @xmath15 defines a pair of fermion annihilation ( creation ) operators for each site @xmath16 and the form of @xmath17 is decided completely by the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix and its elements can be determined by the hermiticity of eq .",
    ", @xmath20 in which @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "although our discussion is restricted to 1d system in this section , it should point out that this situation can be easily generalized to higher dimension systems .    without the loss of generality ,",
    "it is conventional for the translational invariant system to impose the periodic boundary condition . in spite of the simplicity , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "has a wide range of applications , such as the bogoliubov- de gennes hamiltonian in superconductivity , graphite systems @xcite . applying the fourier transformation and considering the periodic boundary condition , @xmath23 in which @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",

    "obviously there is a finite gap between the two bands since @xmath39 .",
    "the ground state is defined as the filled fermi sea @xmath40 , in which @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the vacuum state of @xmath43 .",
    "now it is time to determine the geometric phase eq . , given by the ground - state expectation value of the twist operator eq . .",
    "in this model the twist operator can be expressed explicitly as @xmath44 in which @xmath45 .",
    "seemingly @xmath46 could define the particle number at the site @xmath2 , however the physical meanings for it may be different for different systems , dependent on one s interests ; for spin systems it may denote the total spin at site @xmath2 , and for electron systems it may also denote the total charge number at site @xmath2 .",
    "the geometric phases in the both situations have been defined respectively as the spin berry phase and the charge berry phase , which have extensive applications in determining the phase diagram in strongly correlated electron systems @xcite .",
    "it is a crucial step to determine @xmath9 .",
    "first with the periodic boundary condition , one can rewrite @xmath5 in the moment space @xmath47 now , introduce the new fermion operators @xmath48 in which @xmath32 is defined in eq . and both of @xmath49 satisfy the anti - commutative relation .",

    "substitute eq . into eq .",
    "@xmath51,\\ ] ] in which @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54    the last two terms in eq . precludes the further exact calculations .",
    "an important case is that if @xmath55 , one then can properly choose @xmath32 so that the new fermi operator @xmath49 can be converted into each other by exchanging @xmath56 .",
    "then the terms in eq .",
    ", @xmath57 can cancel each other .",
    "an exact result in this special case can be obtained for @xmath9 @xmath58\\ ] ] in which @xmath59 and from this formula , the geometric phase @xmath12 can also be obtained exactly .",
    "the exact determining of @xmath9 provides the ability to detect the distinguished behaviors of @xmath12 or @xmath9 near the phase transition points .",
    "although the exact results can be obtained only for this special case , some different connections between the geometric phase @xmath12 or @xmath9 and quantum phase transitions are disclosed , as shown in the following calculations .",
    "in this section two representative models are presented to display the distinguished characteristics of @xmath12 or @xmath9 for the determination of the phase diagram in many - body systems .",
    "one is the @xmath13-dimensional free - fermion model , in which the quantum phase transition is originated from the degeneracy of the ground - state energy @xcite .",
    "the other is the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model , in which the quantum phase transition happens with the non - vanishing energy gap above the ground state @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that these examples include two important cases of quantum phase transition ; one is the degeneracy of the ground - state energy , whereas not for the other .",
