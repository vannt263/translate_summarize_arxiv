    "magnetic trapping is an important enabling technology for the active research field of neutral atomic quantum gases .",
    "a variety of trap potentials can be developed using magnetic ( b- ) fields with different spatial distributions and time variations .",
    "for instance , the widely used quadrupole trap and the ioffe - pritchard trap @xcite are usually created with static b - fields , while the time averaged orbiting potential ( top ) @xcite and time orbiting ring trap ( tort ) @xcite are created using oscillating b - fields with frequencies larger than the effective trap frequencies .",
    "atom chips @xcite have brought further developments to magnetic trap technology , as they can provide larger b - fields and gradients at reduced power - consumptions or electric currents using micro - fabricated coils .",
    "today , magnetic trapping is a versatile tool used in many laboratories around the world for controlling atomic spatial motion in regions of different scales and geometric shapes , e.g. , 3d or 2d traps , double well traps , and storage ring traps @xcite .",
    "recently , magnetic traps based on adiabatic microwave @xcite and adiabatic radio frequency ( rf ) potentials ( arfp ) @xcite have attracted considerable attention .",
    "an arfp is typically created with the combination of a static b - field and an rf field .",
    "the idea for an arfp has been around for some time @xcite , and experimental demonstrations recently have been carried out for confining both thermal @xcite and bose condensed atoms @xcite .",
    "further development of improved arfp with atom chip technology likely will assist in practical applications of atom interferometry .",
    "for instance , a double well potential was constructed recently using low order multi - poles capable of atomic beam splitting while maintaining tight spatial confinement @xcite .",
    "several interesting recent proposals outline the construction of small storage rings with radii of the order @xmath0 m @xcite , which could become useful if implemented for atom sagnac interferometry @xcite setups on atom chips .",
    "when a neutral atom is confined in a magnetic potential , its hyperfine spin is assumed to follow adiabatically the spatial variation of the b - field direction during its spatial translational motion . as a result of this adiabatic approximation , the center of mass motion for the atom experiences an induced gauge field @xcite , giving rise to a geometric phase ( or berry s phase ) to the atomic internal spin state @xcite .",
    "the effect of this geometric phase is widely known , and is first addressed carefully in a meaningful way for atomic quantum gases by an explicit calculation of the resulting geometric phase in a static or a time averaged magnetic trap in ref .",
    "several important consequences are predicted to occur for a magnetically trapped atomic condensate in a quadrupole trap , a ioffe - pritchard trap @xcite , or a tort based storage ring @xcite . to our knowledge , this geometric phase effect has not been investigated in any detail for an atom inside an arfp .    in a recent paper , we show that this geometric phase causes an effective aharonov - bohm - type @xcite phase shift in a magnetic storage ring based atom interferometer @xcite .",
    "in addition , our studies imply that the spatial fluctuation of the geometric phase can lead to a reduction of the visibility of the interference contrast . in view of this",
    ", we decided to carry out this study as reported here for the atomic geometric phase in an arfp in order to shed light on the proposed high precision atom sagnac interference experiment @xcite .",
    "analytical derivations for this study at some places become rather tedious and complicated .",
    "we therefore first will summarize our major results here for readers who may not be interested in the intricate details .",
    "we find that the geometric phase in an arfp generally takes a more complicated form in comparison to the case of a static trap or a time averaged trap . in an arfp",
    ", this phase factor is found to be determined by the trajectory of the time independent component of the trap field as well as an  effective b - field \" that depends on the total b - field .",
    "in contrast to the earlier result found for a static trap or a time averaged trap @xcite , the final result turns out to be not expressible as a functional of the trajectory for the direction of the total b - field in the parameter space .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we generalize the semi - classical approach as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite for the operating principle of an arfp to a form more convenient for discussing the geometric phase . section iii parallels that of sec .",
    "ii by reformulating a full quantum theory for discussing the geometric phase inside an arfp @xcite .",
    "the explicit expression for the geometric phase inside an arfp is given in a readily adaptable form for specifical calculations . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the effect of the geometric phase in several types of arfp recently proposed for atomic splitters and storage rings @xcite and beam splitters @xcite . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "in this section , we provide a semi - classical formulation for calculating the atomic geometric phase inside an arfp . the semi - classical working principle for an arfp",
    "is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , although only for the special case when the atomic center of mass is assumed at a fixed location . in order to calculate the geometric phase",
    ", our formulation allows for the explicit consideration of atomic center of mass motion classically . in our approach , the geometric phase",
    "is obtained naturally , and the validity conditions for both the adiabatic and the rotating wave approximations are clearly shown for an arfp .    inside an arfp @xcite ,",

    "@xmath13 is assumed .    for a static or a time averaged magnetic trap , the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) varies slowly over time scales of the larmor precession of the atomic spin in the total b - field .",
    "during the effectively slow trapped motion , the atomic hyperfine spin is assumed to be fixed at the instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . the geometric phase then can be calculated straightforwardly from the variation of the b - field direction in the parameter space @xcite .    in an arfp ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "although the variation of @xmath14 $ ] remains much slower than the larmor precession , the rf frequency @xmath6 usually is assumed to be nearly resonant with the precession frequency .",
