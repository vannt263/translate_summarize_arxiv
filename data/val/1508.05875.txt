    "fragmentation reactions induced by protons and light nuclei of energies around 1 gev / nucleon and below on light target nuclei are involved in different applications , like cosmic - ray - induced single event upsets ( seu s ) , radiation protection , and cancer therapy with proton and ion beams , among others .",
    "it is impossible to measure all nuclear data needed for such applications ; therefore , monte carlo transport codes are usually used to simulate impacts associated with fragmentation reactions .",
    "it is important that available transport codes simulate such reactions as well as possible .",
    "the los alamos monte carlo transport code mcnp6 @xcite uses by default the latest version of the cascade - exciton model ( cem ) as incorporated in its event generator cem03.03 to simulate fragmentation of light nuclei at intermediate energies for reactions induced by nucleons , pions , and photons , and the los alamos version of the quark - gluon string model ( laqgsm ) as implemented in the code laqgsm03.03 ( see @xcite and references therein ) to simulate fragmentation reactions induced by nuclei and by particles at energies above @xmath1 gev , up to about 1 tev / nucleon .",
    "generally , both cem and laqgsm assume that nuclear reactions occur in three stages .",
    "the first stage is the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) , completely different in cem and laqgsm , in which primary particles can be re - scattered and produce secondary particles several times prior to absorption by , or escape from the nucleus .",
    "when the cascade stage of a reaction is complete , cem and laqgsm use the coalescence model to  create \" high - energy d , t , @xmath2he , and @xmath0he via final - state interactions among emitted cascade nucleons , already outside of the target .",
    "the subsequent relaxation of the nuclear excitation is treated in terms of an improved version of the modified exciton model of preequilibrium decay followed by the equilibrium evaporation / fission stage of the reaction .",
    "but if the residual nuclei after the inc have atomic numbers with @xmath3 , cem and laqgsm use the fermi breakup model to calculate their further disintegration instead of using the preequilibrium and evaporation / fission models . thus , for targets with @xmath3 , reactions are assumed to occur only in two stages .",
    "the `` standard '' version of cem and laqgsm account for possible multiple emission of only n , p , d , t , @xmath2he , and @xmath0he during the preequilibrium stage of reactions ( see ref .",
    "their latest , `` f '' , version ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) considers a possibility of preequilibrium emission of light fragments ( lf ) heavier than @xmath0he , up to @xmath4 mg .",
    "it also simulates coalescence of lf heavier than @xmath0he , up to @xmath5 , in cem03.03f ( see @xcite ) , and up to @xmath6 , in laqgsm03.03f ( see @xcite ) .    in recent years , mcnp6 , with its cem and laqgsm event generators , has been extensively validated and verified ( v&v ) against a large variety of nuclear reactions on both thin and thick targets ( see , e.g. refs .",
