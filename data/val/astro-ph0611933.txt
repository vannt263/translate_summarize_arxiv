    "the study of transient and variable phenomena has historically been one of the main drivers of optical astronomy .",
    "this field is now widely expected to undergo a revival , thanks to the dawn of dedicated facilities , such as skymapper @xcite , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ? * ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of precursor surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are already informing us of the difficulty of finding genuine new classes of transients .",
    "solar system objects @xcite and flares from m dwarfs @xcite are now demonstrated to be the most common variable objects .    in this paper",
    "we report on follow - up observations of four optical transients discovered in the rotse - iii sky patrol @xcite , the mpg / eso wide field imager ( wfi ) search for orphan afterglows @xcite . and the sdss supernovae search .",
    "our findings show that cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in general form an additional thin layer of foreground , which also must be pierced through before we can discover new classes of optical transients .",
    "the transient was discovered in rotse - iii sky patrol fields on ut 2006 may 28.94 at an unfiltered magnitude of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "no counterpart was found in previous rotse - iii observations , the digitized sky survey nor the 2-micron all - sky survey . following the discovery ,",
    "the source brightened by @xmath4mag within a day and quickly faded back to around 18th magnitude , where it seemed to stabilize for several days .",
    "observations with the 1.5-m russian - turkish telescope in bakyrlytepe , turkey , on june 1.88 ut , 2006 , detected the source at @xmath5 , v=@xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 color of 0.6mag was commented to be redder than expected for an outburst of a cataclysmic variable .",
    "thus , the source identification remained uncertain .",
    "our photometric follow  up of the transient ( figure  [ fig : r3fc ] ) started on ut 2006 june 4.95 , two days after the discovery was announced and six days after the discovery itself .",
    "our first epoch of observations were obtained with the 1-m telescope at the wise observatory , israel , in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "monitoring in @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the automatic palomar 60-inch telescope ( p60 ) began two days later and a final epoch was obtained with the large field camera at the palomar 200-inch telescope ( p200 ) .",
    "a summary of the observations is presented in table  [ tab : imglog ] .",
    "the first imaging epoch found the source at a brightness of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the subsequent observations with p60 traced the decay which was interrupted by several re - brightening phases with amplitudes of @xmath17mag and color changes from @xmath18mag to @xmath19mag during the variations ( figure  [ fig : r3lc ] ) .",
    "the total galactic foreground extinction in the direction of the candidate is @xmath20 @xcite .    during the first nights of p60 observations the brightness of the transient allowed",
    "a variability study on short time scales using the individual consecutive 150s @xmath12-band exposures ( inset of figure  [ fig : r3lc ] ) .",
    "we inspected images generated by the near - earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) program for past outburst episodes at the position of the transient .",
    "no source was detected in 17 epochs between june 1998 and july 2003 with limiting magnitudes ( roughly @xmath12-band ) of 2021.5 .",
    "similarly , no x - ray counterpart was found in the rosat all - sky survey with a limit of @xmath21count s@xmath22 ( 0.12.4kev ) .",
    "we conclude that the source is mostly in a quiescent state and rarely undergoes outbursts .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained with the double - beam spectrograph ( dbsp ) mounted on the hale-5-m telescope at palomar observatory ( see table  [ tab : speclog ] ) .",
    "dbsp , as suggested by the name , operates with a dichroic and spectra can be obtained in two ( blue and red ) channels simultaneously .",
    "the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : r3spec ] ) shows a flat continuum with strong emission features which we identify with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the emission lines are clearly broadened with a full width at half maximum ( 45@xmath262  for @xmath23 ) suggesting velocities of @xmath272000 km s@xmath22 .",
    "they are structured and double peaked in case of h@xmath28 and h@xmath29 .",
    "in addition , a strong heii emission line at @xmath304686 , blended with the bowen fluorescence @xcite of niii , ciii and civ is detected .",
    "the line properties are summarized in table  [ tab : r3lines ] .",
    "the decaying light curve matches a fast classical novae ( cn ) burst .",
    "however , the absolute peak magnitude of a fast cn is @xmath31mag which would place the transient at a distance of 1mpc .",
    "the absence of a host galaxy makes this interpretation unlikely .    however , a dwarf nova hypothesis is entirely reasonable and in agreement with the emission spectrum .",
    "dwarf novae constitute an important subgroup of cataclysmic variables which undergo outbursts with a brightness increase of 28mag and repetition time scales of days to decades . the large amplitude ( @xmath32mag ,",
    "see figure  [ fig : r3lc ] ) of rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7  along with the outburst duration of @xmath33days resembles a _ superoutburst _ of su  uma - like dne .",
    "superoutburst light curves of these sources typically exhibit a plateau phase with a slow decay of @xmath34mag in 810days after the initial brightening , followed by a steep decline with periodic luminosity modulations , called _",
    "superhumps_. the observed light curve differs by showing an early flare and a shallower ( quasi - exponential ) decay at late times .",
    "however , we found that this temporal behavior is very similar to the superoutburst of the su  uma dwarf nova ru peg in 1981 @xcite . although our data are too sparse to detect clear evidence for superhumps , the re - brightenings and variability on short times scales ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : r3lc ] ) could be interpreted as signatures of such .",
    "the spectrum shows strong similarities to iy uma ( an su  uma dn ) during its superoutburst in 2000 @xcite",
    ". the large flux ratio of heii/@xmath35 is also a popular indicator for a highly magnetic cv , e.g. a polar or an intermediate polar .",
    "however , the temporal behavior of rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7  with its large amplitude outburst from a long lasting quiescent state is entirely inconsistent with the long - term variability expected for a magnetic cv . in addition , the double peaked emission lines and lack of pronounced cyclotron lines clearly provide further evidence that this system is a typically disk cv .",
    "finally , we note the large @xmath36 color ( @xmath34 ) could suggest a cold accretion disk in the system resulting from a low mass accretion rate .",
    "a low mass transfer is reminiscent of cataclysmic variables in the period gap between 2 and 3hours ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which extents to @xmath37hrs for dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "thus , we conjecture that rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7  is a hibernating @xcite su  uma dwarf nova .",
    "in 1999 , a transient and variability survey ( dedicated to the search for orphan afterglows ) was performed at the mpg / eso 2.2-m telescope equipped with the wide field imager ( wfi ) .",
    "12square degrees were monitored in up to 25nights down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the search netted four candidates after filtering for moving or known solar system objects and known variables . for two sources , a classification as a cv and",
    "a flare star were suggested based on their temporal behavior .",
    "follow  up observations for remaining two will be described here and in the following section .",
    "wfi  j161953.3 + 031909  is an uncataloged transient found in the wfi survey when it showed a brightening from a persistent @xmath39 to @xmath40 within two days at ut 1999 june 17.14 .",
    "based on the subsequent optical decay and the detection of a faint x - ray source in the rosat all - sky survey , the source was preliminarily classified as a dwarf nova of the su  uma class .",
    "photometry was obtained in seven epochs in may 2006 with the p60 .",
    "a total of 220 @xmath12-band images with exposures of 150s were taken .",
    "the photometric calibration was tied to the original wfi discovery image ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "relative photometry was applied to correct the series of p60 observations to a common reference system .",
    "the light curve revealed periodic occultations ( figure  [ fig : n3lc ] ) and we derived a firm ephemeris from the timing of six individual eclipses as    @xmath41    with the numbers in brackets giving the uncertainty in the last digits .",
    "the accumulated cycle count between the wfi and p60 observations is too large to derive a unique period solution from 1999 to 2006 .",
    "spectroscopy was performed with the low resolution imager and spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) mounted on the keck i 10-m telescope ( see table .",
    "[ tab : speclog ] ) .",
    "the lris light beam is split by a dichroic and spectra were obtained in the blue and red channel simultaneously .",
    "we obtained two 900s spectra with mid - exposure times corresponding to orbital phases of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the spectra show blue continua with a number of strong emission features which we identify with balmer emission ( @xmath44 ) and hei at @xmath305876 and @xmath306678 .",
    "all lines are double - peaked and clearly broadened with respect to the instrumental line width ( see inset of figure .  [",
    "fig : n3spec ] ) .",
    "in addition , a broad emission feature centered around @xmath45  is found at phase 0.49 .",
    "we associate this with a bowen blend of niii , ciii and civ .",
    "a summary of the line properties is given in table  [ tab : n3lines ] .",
    "the periodic light curve and the spectrum resemble those of a dwarf nova in quiescence .",
    "the detection of deep orbital eclipses ( figure  [ fig : n3lc ] ) , together with the double peaked emission lines indicate a high inclination of the system . out of eclipse , the light curve appears flatter than typically observed in eclipsing dwarf novae . in addition , no strong asymmetry is seen between ingress and egress , suggesting that the hot spot , the region where the gas stream collides with the accretion disk , would be weaker than usual .",
    "this is in agreement with the low mass transfer rate assumed for cvs in the period gap , in which wfi  j161953.3 + 031909  falls .",
    "the double peaked emission lines ( figure  [ fig : n3spec ] ) , the absence of pronounced cyclotron features and the non - detection of heii indicate a disk system .",
    "the detection of the bowen blend around @xmath304665 bears evidence of irradiation in the disk or the secondary .",
    "heii emission , which leads to the bowen fluorescence , is not detected , though .",
    "this suggests a considerable heii opacity .",
    "the orbital period of @xmath46min implies that observations taken at the same ut but over different nights , will result in the source being observed at nearly identical orbital phases .",
    "in retrospect , we now realize that the original survey data were obtained at phases at which the object exhibited extreme brightness .",
    "the maximum brightness in the wfi detections of @xmath40 corresponds to the median brightness out of eclipse ( see figure .  [",
    "fig : n3lc ] ) and the ( falsely interpreted ) quiescent brightness of @xmath39 is similar to what is observed during the eclipse .",
    "summarizing , we found no evidence for a dwarf nova outburst of wfi  j161953.3 + 031909  and thus are left with the rough classification of the source as a disk cv .",
    "indeed , the brighter quiescent magnitude than previously thought , implies @xmath47 , consistent with a larger variety of cvs .",
    "the source was detected on june 26.07 ut , 1999 , at a maximum brightness of @xmath39 . as a result of the scheduling ,",
    "no observations could be obtained during a subsequent decay . however ,",
    "a faint uncataloged and persistent object ( @xmath48 ) was found , offset by 08 from the location of the transient source .",
    "this apparent association allowed for a possible extragalactic origin of the transient with the persistent source being the underlying host galaxy .",
    "it was therefore interpreted as the best candidate for an orphan afterglow found in the survey .",
    "however , given the sparse data coverage , other interpretations ( extra - galactic , galactic and even solar system ) could not be excluded .",
    "spectroscopy of the of the persistent source associated with wfi  j132813.7@xmath0214237   was performed with lris .",
    "we find strong absorption features which we identify with ca h&k , g - band , @xmath24 and @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2spec ] ) .",
    "the narrow lines allow to estimate the velocity with respect to the local standard rest frame to 0@xmath2650 km s@xmath22 .",
    "no significant emission lines are detected .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with that of a galactic g - star .",
    "thus , we can rule out an extra - galactic origin for the persistent source . as a result ,",
    "there is little justification to assume that the transient source was extra - galactic .",
    "instead the detection was likely the misleading alliance of a moving solar system object superimposed on a background star .",
    "the position in the ecliptic plane ( ecliptic coordinates @xmath49 & @xmath50 ) supports this scenario .",
    "sdss - sn15207 was discovered on 2006 october 11 as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) search for supernovae at ra(j2000)=20@xmath5158@xmath5243@xmath5345 , dec(j2000)=01@xmath5402@xmath5547@xmath560 .",
    "sdss imaging prior to the eruption shows no underlying host galaxy to a limit of @xmath57=24 .",
    "the sdss optical light curve showed a peak magnitude of @xmath57=19.8 on oct 12 followed by a decline by 1.2mag over 5days . continued monitoring with p60 during the first 80days",
    "did not detect additional outbursts to a limiting magnitude of @xmath57=22 .",
    "we obtained a spectrum with the gemini multi object spectrograph ( gmos ) on gemini - south on 2006 november 17 ( table  [ tab : speclog ] ) . at this time , the event had faded to @xmath58 .",
    "this resulting low - signal - to - noise spectrum ( figure  [ fig:15207 ] ) shows a blue continuum and a single emission line ( fwhm@xmath59km / s ) , which we identify with h@xmath60 .",
    "the line centroid suggest a galactic origin .",
    "we also obtained a 4.77ks exposure with the x - ray telescope aboard swift on 2006 november 4 .",
    "not counterpart was found with a 2@xmath61 flux limit of @xmath62ergs @xmath63 s@xmath22 ( 0.210kev ) .      the peak magnitude of this transient rules out the possibility that it is a nova in the milky way . the optical light curve , in particular ,",
    "the steep decline of 1.2 mag in 5 days and 1.6 mag in 9 days does not suggest a typical supernova either . on the other hand ,",
    "the observations are consistent with a super outburst ( @xmath32mag ) of a galactic dwarf nova .",
    "the non - detection of the quiescent counterpart to @xmath64 and the lack of significant foreground extinction in the optical colors and spectrum , suggest sdss - sb15207 to have be located a a relative large distance from the earth . assuming a absolute quiescence magnitude of @xmath65 ( white dwarf with @xmath66k , @xmath67 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lower limit on the distance is 2.5kpc .",
    "here we reported on photometric and spectroscopic follow  up observations for four recently communicated transient sources .",
    "we found that wfi  j132813.7@xmath0214237 , the best orphan afterglow candidate detected in the wfi survey @xcite , was with high probability a misidentified solar system object spatially coincident with a background source .",
    "next , the potential outburst light curve of a second source from the same survey , wfi  j161953.3 + 031909 , was recognized as serendipitous observations in and out of eclipse of a high - inclination cataclysmic variable .",
    "finally , rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7 , discovered by rotse - iii @xcite and ( potentially sdss - sn15207 ) were identified as the superoutbursts of su  uma - like dwarf nova .    in the following ,",
    "we restrain from exploring the two wfi sources any further , except noting again the interesting coincidences which had lured us to incorrect conclusions previously . instead , we want to address the implications of the faint quiescent magnitudes of rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7  ( @xmath68 ) and sdss - sn15207 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we start by noting that a very similar event ( 1955 + 22c var vul 05 ) has been discovered in august 2005 with 15.8mag at maximum and an amplitude of at least 9mag .",
    "this quiescent faintness of these three events indicates an important factor for future wide - field transient searches , namely , dwarf novae which stay most of the time below the limiting magnitude of a survey , but appear as new transient sources during outbursts .",
    "this includes cvs which appear faint in quiescence because of large distance or galactic extinction and intrinsically low - magnitude systems .",
    "the latter group is dominated by systems with low mass transfer , typical for cvs in the period gap and in hibernation @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the vast majority of non - magnetic cvs with @xmath70hrs are dwarf novae ( @xmath71% ) while this is true only for @xmath72% with @xmath73hrs @xcite .    as an example , let us consider the proposed 3@xmath74 steradian survey with panstarrs-1 ( ps1 ) which is expected to reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath75 and @xmath76 in a single 30s and combined images over 3yrs , respectively .",
    "in such a survey , sources similar to rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7  at twice the distance would no longer be detectable in quiescence , but only during the rare outburst periods .",
    "this directly leads to the question of how important these events will be in future wide - field surveys .",
    "the expected number of dne events in an all - sky snapshot can be obtained rather crudely , given the large number of involved parameters ( e.g. , intrinsic quiescent magnitude , superoutburst amplitude , superoutburst cycle ) .",
    "let the quiescent absolute magnitude of the dn be m@xmath7712 @xcite .",
    "for the volume distribution we assume a local scale height of 300pc perpendicular to the galactic disk and isotropy in the radial direction in the disk .",
    "furthermore , we consider for simplicity an upper limit for the distance in the galactic plane of 2kpc , above which extinction will dominate at low galactic latitude . for the observed local density of dwarf novae we use @xmath78pc@xmath79 @xcite and theory",
    "allows for even higher values ( @xmath80 to @xmath81pc@xmath79 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting number of expected dwarf novae in the considered volume , independent of their activity , is given in table  [ tab : dnstats ] for three different ranges of galactic latitude .",
    "how many of those will be in superoutburst at any given time ? assuming a mean cycle duration of 1yr and a mean plateau length of 10days we find that between 40 and 1.5@xmath82 events , depending on the galactic latitude and assumed space density , can be expected in an all - sky snapshot with maximum depth .",
    "most of these ( @xmath83 ) will be at low and medium galactic latitude and only a small fraction ( @xmath84 ) is expected to occur at @xmath85 .",
    "the space density of cvs decreases rapidly with distance from the galactic plane .",
    "similarly , at low galactic latitude extinction limits the observable . as a result ,",
    "the number of dwarf novae with quiescent brightness below the survey limiting magnitude ( here @xmath86 ) will be negligible .",
    "however , shallower surveys will detect less quiescent systems as indicated in figure  [ fig : prediction ] .",
    "thus , mainly these surveys will be contaminated by dwarf novae superoutbursts with undetected quiescent counterparts",
    ".    the yearly all - sky rate of less than @xmath87 detectable superoutbursts is in the range of the local volume rates ( gpc@xmath79 yr@xmath22 ) for core - collapse sne ( @xmath88 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but considerably lower than the rates of novae ( @xmath89 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galactic m - dwarf flares ( @xmath90yr@xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , one has to remember that the theoretical cv space densities typically imply a large fraction of systems with cycle periods of years to decades ( e.g. , wz sge ) .",
    "thus , the yearly all sky rate is probably much less than value given above .",
    "this suggests that dwarf nova superoutbursts will not produce a dominant contamination in future wide - field surveys .",
    "however , they will still be of concern for observers mining the optical transient sky .    how can the small number of dwarf novae outbursts be distinguished in practice from other kinds of interesting transients ? the most important factors will be the choice of cadence and the field selection . a good sign for a dn will be a location close to the galactic disk or inner galaxy .",
    "indeed , the positions of rotse3  j160213.1@xmath0021311.7  ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) and also of 1955 + 22c var vul 05 ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) are consistent with being part of the disk population .",
    "however , the galactic plane is known to harbor plentiful of variable and transient sources .",
    "choosing the right observing strategy ( cadence , filter ) will help to distinguish between short lived phenomena ( e.g. , flare stars ) and dwarf novae",
    ". the main confusion at high galactic latitude will be by novae and supernovae .",
    "novae , however , will be distinguishable by their enormous brightness ( if galactic ) or by their association with a nearby galaxy .",
    "supernovae may similarly identified by their host galaxies .",
    "spectroscopy of the remaining candidates would require significant amounts of time on large telescopes and is thus not a feasible approach .",
    "photometric colors vary considerably from one event to another and will therefore not be useable as reliable indicators either .",
    "the best confirmation , however , can be obtained by photometric follow - up searches for the expected superhump structures .",
    "we close this paper noting the role of future large surveys for our general understanding of cataclysmic variables .",
    "complete wide - area surveys on long times scales will allow the in - depth study of the distribution of orbital periods and outburst behaviors ( amplitudes , cycles ) .",
    "this will provide important informations on the evolution of cvs and the processes of mass accretion in these systems .",
