    "in entanglement - based protocols for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite two honest parties ( alice and bob ) can obtain a secure secret key by performing measurements on shared epr pairs @xcite .",
    "they can also certify that they have epr pairs by observing sufficiently strong violations of bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "when the epr pairs are noisy , measurements lead to noisy and partially secret correlations . in order to obtain perfect secret bits , error correction and privacy amplification have to be performed , with the assistance of local operations and public communication ( lopc ) @xcite . before implementing this procedure , however , an estimate of the quality of the correlations needs to be performed . formulated in a different way ,",
    "an estimate of the maximal amount of information that an eavesdropper ( eve ) has about alice s and bob s bits has to be performed .",
    "this is done by exploiting the monogamy of entanglement , which imposes trade - offs between the entanglement between alice and bob , and eve s correlations with them @xcite .    a way of estimating the degree of entanglement that alice and bob share is to perform quantum tomography @xcite .",
    "in order to do so , they have to assume that the quantum systems they measure live on a state space of a particular dimension @xmath0 ( usually two ) .",
    "this assumption , though strong , is usually not mentioned in the presentations of qkd . in particular",
    ", it implies that alice and bob must trust their apparatuses ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .    a framework in which one can analyze quantum correlations without knowledge of the dimension @xmath0 is to consider them in the larger set of no - signaling correlations @xcite .",
    "no - signaling correlations are characterized by the assumption that _ no measuring process can be used to send information between distant locations_. in this framework , the origin of the correlations , the kind of system that has been measured , and in particular , the dimension @xmath0 of the underlying quantum system , do not matter .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , if the obtained correlations violate some bell inequality then there is some degree of privacy in them  in the sense that secret key is needed to create these correlations by lopc .",
    "the first protocol proved secure against a no - signaling eavesdropper is the bhk - protocol , introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the security analysis provided was limited , it only applies to the noiseless regime and has a vanishing secret key rate . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the bhk - protocol with a positive key rate is secure against individual attacks , even in the noisy regime . in the present paper",
    "we generalize this result to completely general attacks .",
    "the security definition that we use is the strongest one , the so called _ universally - composable security_. one calls a cryptographic primitive ( for instance key distribution ) universally composable if it is secure in any arbitrary context ( for instance one - time pad encryption ) @xcite .",
    "the secret key rate that we obtain is comparable to the one obtained when the eavesdropper is constrained by quantum mechanics , and when the devices are fully specified and trusted .    in order to do so",
    ", we introduce an exponentially - accurate scheme for estimating symmetric properties of arbitrary multipartite probability distributions . also , we prove the security of privacy amplification in a similar way as in @xcite .",
    "our proof has the advantage that can accommodate any error - correction scheme .",

    "we prove this according to the strongest notion of security , the so - called universally - composable security @xcite .",
    "the only assumption used in the security proof is the impossibility of arbitrarily - fast signaling between subsystems by performing local measurements .",
    "we introduce an exponentially - accurate scheme for estimating symmetric properties of general distributions .",

    "assumption .",
    "our approach to qkd goes beyond the philosophy of @xcite in which there is still quantum mechanics , in particular , the validity of tsirelson s bound @xcite is assumed .",
    "in contrast , our approach is conceptually simpler in that _ all _ we assume is no - signaling .",
    "it is remarkable that , although our security is based on weaker assumptions , the secret key rates that we obtain are comparable to the ones where the adversary s attack is constrained by no - signaling plus quantum mechanics @xcite . in particular , we obtain the optimal rate of one secret bit per singlet consumed .",
