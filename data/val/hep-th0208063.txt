    "it is well known that black holes have thermodynamical properties , i.e. entropy@xcite and temperature@xcite , which can be understood in the framework of general relativity@xcite and quantum theory of matter in curved spacetime@xcite . in these formalisms , the entropy for a black hole",
    "is given by a quarter of its horizon area and hawking radiation can be explained as a particle creation caused by existence of the horizon .",
    "some years ago , in the string theory , which seems to be most promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity , it was found that the d - brane can also describe black hole spacetime and its thermodynamical properties@xcite . in this prescription ,",
    "the entropy for a black hole is derived by counting the number of microscopic states on the d - brane@xcite , and hawking radiation can be recognized as emission process of closed strings from the d - brane@xcite .    as for the scattering processes of a particle or a wave in a black hole spacetime ,",
    "we can observe a good agreement between a d - brane picture and an analysis based on the corresponding supergravity description .",
    "especially the absorption cross section for a dilaton by the d3-brane in a low - energy region , which is evaluated by means of the world volume approach , has been shown to coincide with the result obtained by solving the wave equation for the dilaton field propagating in the 3-brane background@xcite .",
    "taking account of the above results in the scattering processes , it seems to be quite natural to pose a question whether the agreement is hold even for quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole or not .",
    "qnms characterize the emission of a gravitational wave which represents a response to a perturbation affected to a black hole spacetime@xcite .",
    "as briefly reviewed in appendix a , it is obtained by solving the wave equation on the background with the suitable boundary conditions that the flux at the horizon is ingoing and outgoing at spatial infinity .",
    "qnm is characterized by a complex frequency whose imaginary part represents the time scale in which the perturbation to the black hole spacetime decays . since black holes are interpreted as thermal objects that are characterized by thermal quantities such as the temperature and entropy , the imaginary part of the qnm frequency can be recognized as the relaxation time within which black holes approach to the thermal equilibrium .",
    "as was well known , the relationship between d - branes and black holes in string theory is an important precursor to the ads / cft correspondence . and",
    "connection between qnms and the decay of perturbations in the dual cft was first suggested in the work of @xcite based on the numerical computation of qnms for ads - schwarzschild black holes in several dimensions .",
    "qnms of ads black holes and btz black holes are investigated in @xcite and those of near extremal black branes are found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore in @xcite , it was shown that the frequencies of qnms for btz black holes are in exact agreement with the location of the poles of the retarded correlation function describing the linear response on the cft side .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the d3-brane as an other example of the correspondence in qnms .",
    "our analyses for the d3-branes will be performed in the two different parameter regions in type iib string theory , one is large number of the d3-branes and the other is only one d3-brane . in the first region , the classical supergravity is effective so that gravity is described by the curvature of space - time . in the later , the perturbative field theory on the d3-brane , which is embedded in a flat spacetime , is effective . in such flat spacetime , how qnms can be calculated ?",
    "this is our main interest and motivation in this paper .",
    "we will apply feynman s space - time approach to this problem , which gives alternative intuitive methods to quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "we perturbatively solve the equation derived from the low energy effective action for the d3-brane , i.e. the dirac - born - infeld action , which describes propagation of a dilaton wave in the bulk flat spacetime and its interaction with d - branes .",
    "and we apply a general condition for qnms which is obtained in appendix a to the scattering problem of this flat d3-brane case .",
    "it is shown that the obtained condition of qnms is qualitatively equivalent to that evaluated in the framework of the usual scattering of the dilaton wave based of the supergravity description .",
    "a brief outline of this paper is following . in the next section",
    ", we obtain the qnms for the 3-brane by solving the wave equation propagating on its background in classical supergravity analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "only one d3-brane are considered and the condition of the qnms are obtained by the feynman s space - time approach .",
    "these two results are compared and discussed in section 4 . in appendix",
    "a , we give a brief review of qnms .",
    "absorption of a scalar for d3-brane is also investigated by space - time approach and the result is compared with the result of @xcite in appendix c.",
    "in this section , we evaluate the qnm of 3-brane solution of type iib supergravity .",
    "the main analysis of this section is based on the results obtained in @xcite , which studies absorption probability of a dilaton by the d3-brane .",
    "we consider the dilaton as a minimally coupled scalar , which obeys the wave equation @xmath0 in the spacetime whose metric is given by @xmath1 the characteristic length of the 3-brane @xmath2 is related to 10-dimensional gravitational coupling constant @xmath3 as follows , @xmath4 in the case of the scattering in the low energy region @xmath5 , the dominant contribution to the cross section comes from spherical symmetric process so that we concentrate the radial equation for s - wave of energy @xmath6 derived from eq.([min - eq ] ) @xmath7 \\phi(r ) = 0 .",

    "as we describe in appendix a , qnms are given by the condition , @xmath24 in order to compare the obtained results ( [ cond.qnm ] ) with the evaluation of qnms in the next section based on dirac - born - infeld action which is the low energy effective theory of the d3-branes , we consider the qnm condition ( [ cond.qnm ] ) in the low energy region , i.e. , @xmath25 , that can be expanded with respect to @xmath26 as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is written by the characteristic length of the 3-brane @xmath2 and the euler constant @xmath29 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a phase factor , @xmath32 let us solve approximately the above qnm condition up to the lowest order @xmath33 , @xmath34 in the usual evaluation to qnms @xcite , their frequencies are characterized by the curvature scale of the black hole space time , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "contrastingly , our calculation , which is valid in the range to @xmath36 , gives qnms in the low energy region . from the observational point of view",
    ", the frequencies for qnms obtained in this paper might not be important .",
    "however recall that our main interest is to confirm the equivalence between two different pictures , i.e. the d3-branes and black 3-branes , in the case of qnms .    from the condition ( [ eq.for qnm to 8 ] ) in the region @xmath36",

    "there are two cases for the solution of eq.([r= ] ) and eq.([eq for theta ] ) as follows , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an integer .",
    "the condition @xmath46 is satisfied when @xmath49 .",
    "let us consider the case ( i ) .",
    "we put @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "then eq.([eq for theta ] ) can be written as follows , @xmath52 @xmath53 must be much less than unity in order that the second term of the above equation cancels the first term .",
    "it follows that , @xmath54 in the case ( ii ) , we put @xmath55 . after a similar analysis",
    ", we have the same result eq.([delta_n ] ) for @xmath53 .",
    "this @xmath53 are very small number as long as @xmath37 , so that the solution of eq.([eq.for qnm to 8 ] ) is just below the real axis of complex @xmath33 plane .",
    "the radial parameter @xmath41 can be written as , @xmath56 the qnms frequency are @xmath57 times eighth roots of @xmath58 .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of a small number of the d3-brane in string theory , so that the description of the system based on the field theory with dirac - born - infeld action is effective one rather than that in terms of the supergravity which has been used in the previous section . for simplicity ,",
    "we treat one d3-brane in flat space - time and field theory with dbi action on it . in the case of the dilaton absorption by d3-brane@xcite ,",
    "the evaluation of the cross section is based on the world - volume interpretation , in which bulk dilaton field is recognized as a source of the world - volume fluctuation .",
    "in other words , it is assumed that quantum fluctuation of the bulk fields decouples and the dynamics is strictly on the brane .",
    "as explained in the appendix a , qnms are determined by the condition ( [ general cond of qnm ] ) which states no incident wave in the scattering of the dilaton field in the black hole spacetime , and the reflective amplitude is needed to evaluate qnms frequency .",
    "the world - volume approach @xcite do not give reflective amplitude which is concerned to bulk propagation .",
    "thus the world - volume approach@xcite is not suitable for investigation of qnms . since the above definition of qnms ( [ general cond of qnm ] ) based on the scattering processes of the dilaton",
    ", we have to take account of its bulk propagation at least . in order to keep close similarity to the evaluation of qnms in previous section based on the classical supergravity",
    ", we throw a dilaton into a d3-brane from spatial infinity , which is treated as a wave in field theory such as r.p.feynmans space - time approach @xcite .",
    "incident dilaton propagates in the bulk space and eventually interacts with a d3-brane . by perturbatively solving the wave equation for the dilaton , we can obtain its reflective amplitude .",
    "another reason for using this space - time approach is that we bear its waveform in mind , which is one of the other important aspects of qnms .",
    "the calculation based on cft @xcite might be enough to evaluate the frequencies of qnms which are given by positions of poles of the retarded cft correlator .",
    "however our approach can tell us actual wave forms observed at infinity .",
    "thus it is possible to discuss relation between two pictures of black hole spacetime , i.e. the supergravity and the d - brane description , from the viewpoint not only of the frequencies of qnms but also their wave forms . in the appendix c , for a proof of the validity of our calculation based on the feynman s spacetime approach",
    ", the dilaton absorption cross section is evaluated by the formalism which developed in the present paper . and",
    "we show that our result agrees in the lowest order with that obtained by the world volume approach@xcite .    for a low - energy dilaton",
    ", dbi action can be expanded in einstein frame as follows@xcite ,    @xmath59    where@xmath60 and @xmath61 is the tension of the d3-brane .",
    "the term @xmath62 is field strength of the gauge field on the 3-brane describing its longitudinal dynamics , while its transverse oscillations do not couple with dilaton . for @xmath63 case ,",
    "gauge fields on the d3-brane are photon , and we take coulomb gauge for it on the d3-brane . then the action for the dilaton in the bulk and the gauge fields on the brane is given by    @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "for a low energy dilaton , the scattering process is dominated by s - wave so that we can put its form as @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the evolution of the dilaton in the bulk and the gauge filed on the brane are expressed by the wave equations , @xmath69 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{t_3}\\partial_a \\left [ ( \\epsilon^{lmn } \\dot{a}_l \\partial_m a_n)\\epsilon^{bai}\\dot{a}_b \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we change the variable as @xmath70 .",
    "we can solve these wave equations by means of perturbation with respect to interaction with gauge fields , i.e , the coupling constant @xmath3 , and four point interaction of gauge fields , whose coupling constant is @xmath71 . at first , these waves are formally expanded in terms of the two coupling constants , @xmath72 we are interested only in response of the d3-brane to the incident dilaton wave .",
    "so we omit terms @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the above expansions , since these terms represent excitation which exists before arrival of the injected dilaton at 3-brane .    at @xmath75-order",
    ", we obtain wave equations @xmath76 which express that the dilaton wave does not interact with the d3-brane at the origin @xmath77 , and pass through it .",
    "so , regularity of the dilaton at the origin requires that the wave is reflected with the same amplitude as that of incidental one .",

    "we prepare the wave function in the lowest order , @xmath83 , to express its vacuum fluctuation of the photon so that its normalization is taken to be as same as that in the corresponding quantum field theory .    at @xmath84-order ,",
    "the wave equations for the gauge field is @xmath85 here we choose a negative energy photon @xmath86 in eq.([(1,0)eq ] ) .",
    "thus this equation shows that the positive energy photon @xmath87 is created from the positive energy dilaton @xmath88 and the negative energy photon @xmath83 .",
    "because , in standard prescription of quantum field theories , a negative energy wave function is interpreted as an anti - particle which moves opposite direction , eq.([(1,0)eq ] ) describes a dilaton annihilation on the d3-brane and pair creation of photons as the calculation based on cft in @xcite . in order to construct the solution of eq.([(1,0)eq ] ) , we use the retarded green s function for 4-dimensional dalembertian , @xmath89 satisfying @xmath90 which leads to created photon on the d3-brane , @xmath91 the wave equation for the dilaton at ( 2,0)-order is given by @xmath92 the homogeneous part of the solution for the above equation should be zero , since there is no incident dilaton at ( 2,0)-order . and the eq.([(2,0)eq ] ) represents the process that the excited gauge field @xmath93 and positive energy photon @xmath94 annihilate to emit a dilaton wave away from the d3-brane",

    "the eq.([(2,0)eq ] ) tells us that @xmath101 is created through annihilation of two photons , @xmath83 and @xmath87 , which are described by eq.([(1,0)eq ] ) .",
    "as discussed before , it can be interpreted that two photons are emerge via the pair creation process .",
    "thus in the framework of quantum field theories , the external line corrected by the 1-loop self energy feynman diagram depicted in fig . [ fig:1-loop ] would correspond to the dilaton wave function @xmath101 .",
