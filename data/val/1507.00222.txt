    "it is widely recognized that time dependent current fluctuations due to the discreteness of the electrical charges  shot noise power ",
    "provide further physical information of an electronic system than other transport quantities such as the conductance .",
    "for instance , the shot noise takes into account the pauli principle and it can reveal electron correlations .",
    "markus bttiker and collaborators recognized the importance of the shot noise for the understanding of the problem of quantum electron transport and made major contributions to this topic .",
    "the shot - noise power can be studied by using a scattering approach to quantum transport . within this framework",
    ", bttiker found that the shot - noise power spectrum @xmath0 , in the zero frequency limit and zero temperature , can be written as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the conductance quantum , @xmath3 the applied voltage , while the @xmath4 s are the transmission eigenvalues of the hermitean matrix @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the @xmath7 transmission matrix .",
    "if there were no correlations among electrons , the shot noise is given by the poisson value @xmath8 .",
    "the shot noise power has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically in small electronic devices such as quantum wires and quantum dots , in which quantum coherence is preserved .",
    "the literature on this topic is very extensive , we thus refer the reader to the review articles refs .",
    "@xcite .    in general",
    ", electron correlations reduce the shot noise respect to the case of fully uncorrelated electrons .",
    "the fano factor @xmath9 measures that suppression of the shot noise and it is defined by the ratio @xmath10 , where the brackets indicate energy or ensemble average . using random matrix theory to quantum transport , it has been predicted that the fano factor takes the value 1/3 for disordered quantum wires in the diffusive regime limit @xcite , while for ballistic chaotic quantum dots @xmath11 , in the limit of large number of channels supported by the leads attached to the dots @xcite .",
    "thus , universal values of the shot noise suppression have been predicted for both transport regimes .    with respect to graphene , several electronic properties",
    "have been intensively studied since its discovery in 2004 and the shot noise is not an exception ( for a review , see @xcite and @xcite ) . for pristine graphene structures",
    "whose lengths are shorter than their widths , it has been predicted a 1/3 shot - noise suppression , at the dirac point @xcite .",
    "this suppression value coincides with the fano factor value for disordered normal - metal wires in the diffusive regime .",
    "although pristine graphene structures show many interesting electronic properties , in real graphene - based devices those properties may be affected by the presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "in general , different sources of disorder can be present in graphene such as ripples , vacancies , adatoms , or distortions of the lattice produced by interactions with the substrate @xcite , however , even suspended graphene structures are not free of defects @xcite .    in particular , effects of the presence of disorder on the shot noise in graphene sheets",
    "have been experimentally and theoretically investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the fano factor is affected by the strength of the disorder , as well as the length - to - width ratio of the graphene sample .",
    "most of those studies , however , have been concentrated on wide geometries and models of disorder that break the chiral symmetry of the graphene sublattices .     with zigzag ( a ) and armchair ( b ) edges with perfect",
    "graphene leads ( non - shaded areas ) attached .",
    "the width @xmath12 of the nanoribbons has been fixed : @xmath13 and 5@xmath14 for zigzag and armchair nanoribbons ( @xmath14 being the lattice constant @xmath15 ) , respectively . with those widths",
    ", the attached perfect leads have gapless metallic band structures . ]    here , we are interested in the properties of the shot noise at the dirac point in finite disordered graphene samples , i.e. , disordered nanoribbons , in which the edge terminations as well as the symmetry of the graphene sublattices play a crucial role in the electronic properties .",
    "we thus investigate the random fluctuations of the shot noise power for the two different edge terminations : zigzag and armchair , fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] . for both terminations",
    ", we consider the so - called off - diagonal disorder ( random hopping connecting the two graphene sublattices ) in order to preserve the chiral symmetry of the graphene sublattices .",
    "this kind of short - range disorder might model distortions like ripples in the graphene lattice .",
    "actually , experimental evidence of short range disorder in graphene has been observed @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we are interested in studying the effects of the nanoribbon edge terminations and the presence of disorder on the statistical properties of the shot noise power .",
    "the most interesting properties of graphene are found at low energies , i.e. , near the dirac point where a linear dispersion relation holds and an analogy with relativistic massless particles has attracted much attention . also , the lattice symmetry of graphene or chiral symmetry , resulting in a symmetric energy spectrum around the fermi energy plays an important role in the description of the electronic properties ; hence , we are interested in calculating statistical properties of the shot noise near the dirac point .",
    "we recall that in clean graphene nanoribbons the band structure is determined by the edge termination and the width of the nanoribbons . here",
    "we consider disordered nanoribbons with attached perfect leads whose band structure is metallic . in the next section",
    "we introduce a statistical model to describe the random fluctuations of the shot noise power , eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "the statistical properties of the shot noise power in disordered graphene nanoribbons can be analyzed through the statistical properties of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath4 , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "a well established theoretical framework to study the transmission statistics of disordered systems is the one - parameter scaling approach to localization @xcite and random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "our statistical analysis of the shot noise is based on that scaling approach to anderson localization and a recent extension to the case of anomalous localization @xcite . in general",
    ", the manner in which electrons are localized determines the statistical properties of quantum transport .",
    "therefore , the statistics of the transmission , or conductance , for standard ( anderson ) and anomalous localizations is different .",
    "for instance , the average of the conductance of disordered systems in the presence of anderson localization decays exponentially with the system length , whereas the conductance average has a power - law decay with the length for disorder systems with anomalous localization .",
    "both kind of localizations have been investigated in disordered zigzag and armchair nanoribbons @xcite .    on the one hand , near the dirac point , only a single transmission eigenvalue contributes to the electronic transport .",
    "therefore , since we are interested in the shot noise near the dirac point , we only need to consider one transmission eigenvalue and the shot - noise power in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) is reduced to @xmath16 . for convenience",
    ", we introduced the dimensionless shot - noise power @xmath17 defined as : @xmath18 thus , along this work we will be interested in describing the statistical properties of the shot noise power @xmath17 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , within the scaling approach to localization and random matrix theory , the distribution of the transmission @xmath19 is given by the solution of the so - called melnikov s equation , which is an evolution equation of @xmath19 with the length of the disordered system @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the melnikov s equation is known in terms of quadratures . to simplify the calculations and provide analytical expressions for shot noise distribution",
    ", we find convenient to consider an approximation to the exact solution @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a normalization constant and @xmath22 is the ratio @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the length of the system and @xmath25 , the mean free path .",
    "the above distribution , eq . ( [ poft ] ) , has been verified in a number of numerical simulations for any practical value of the disorder strength ( measured by the value of @xmath22 ) as well as in microwave experiments @xcite .",
    "additionally , the value of the parameter @xmath22 can be obtained from the numerical or experimental data through the linear dependence of the average @xmath26 with @xmath24 : @xmath27 .",
    "we point out that the distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ poft ] ) is appropriate for systems in which the presence of disorder leads to an exponential localization of electron wavefunctions ( anderson localization ) with the distance @xmath28 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 being a constant .",
    "this exponential decay has been experimentally and theoretically studied in several different disordered systems @xcite .",
    "the presence of disorder , however , can lead to a different electron localization , or anomalous localization , in relation to the above - mentioned standard exponential decay .",
    "for example , in one - dimensional disordered systems , at the center of the band , the wavefunction decays as @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xcite . for disordered armchair nanoribbons",
    ", it has been also shown that electrons are anomalously localized ( @xmath33 ) @xcite .",

    "the model is summarized by the following equation which gives the distribution of the transmission in terms of two quantities : the average @xmath38 and @xmath35 : @xmath39 where we have defined @xmath40 .",
