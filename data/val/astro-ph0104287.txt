    "efforts to understand the newly identified classes of neutron stars , in particular anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps - mereghetti 1999 ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs - woods et al .",
    "1999 ) have followed two avenues .",
    "magnetar models , involving neutron star dipole magnetic fields @xmath1 g , above the quantum critical field @xmath2 g , were advanced to explain the mechanism and energetics of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "alternative models propose to explain the new classes of neutron stars in terms of conventional @xmath3 g fields .",
    "these models involve accretion or propeller ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) torques from an accretion disk surrounding the isolated neutron stars ( alpar 1999 , 2001 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "alpar ( 1999 , 2001 ) argued that radio pulsars , dim thermal neutron stars ( dtns ; treves et al .",
    "2000 ) , axps and radio quiet neutron stars ( rqnss ; chakrabarty et al . 2001 ) and perhaps sgrs represent alternative pathways of young neutron stars , distinguished by the history of mass inflow ( @xmath4 ) from a fall - back accretion disk .",
    "this work classified young neutron stars according to ranges of @xmath4 , taken as representative constant values , with radio pulsars corresponding to zero or very weak @xmath4 , such that the disk does not quench the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the inner radius of the disk must lie at or beyond the light cylinder .",
    "disks around radio pulsars were first proposed by michel & dessler ( 1981 , 1983 ) and michel ( 1988 ) . for the axps chatterjee , hernquist & narayan ( 2000 ) studied a fall - back disk with a specific time dependent mass - inflow rate @xmath5 taken to follow a self - similar thin disk solution , which entails a power - law decay of @xmath5 ( cannizzo , lee & goodman 1990 , mineshige , nomoto & shigeyama 1993 ) . according to this model",
    "some neutron stars go through propeller and accretion ( axp ) phases as @xmath5 evolves while others , at magnetic fields @xmath6 become radio pulsars after a very brief initial accretion phase .",
    "what are the implications of a fall - back disk for radio pulsars ?",
    "marsden , lingenfelter and rothschild ( 2001a , b ) argued that the presence of a propeller spin - down torque from a fall - back disk in conjunction with the magnetic dipole radiation torque may explain the large discrepancy ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) between the real ( kinematic ) age and the `` characteristic '' age @xmath7 corresponding to pure dipole spin - down for the pulsar b1757 - 24 , and that pulsar - snr age discrepancies can be explained in a similar way .",
    "menou , perna and hernquist ( 2001b ) showed that this combination of dipole and propeller torques can explain the braking indices @xmath8 of five young pulsars .",
    "in this letter we apply the combined spin - down torque , using the model of menou , perna and hernquist ( 2001b ) , to the distribution of pulsars in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "presence of torques other than dipole radiation torques , in particular torques that might arise from the ambient medium near a young pulsar in a supernova remnant was proposed first by yusifov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to explain qualitatively the measured braking indices @xmath8 of young pulsars , the discrepancy between real and characteristic ages and the distribution of pulsars in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "gvaramadze ( 2001 ) invokes torques from circumstellar clumps in the snr to derive a `` true '' age for psr b1509 - 58 in agreement with the snr age . in section 2",
    ", we explore the combined torque model , using the canonical magnetic dipole torque together with the model of menou , perna and hernquist ( 2001b ) for the propeller spin - down torque , with a constant mass inflow rate @xmath4 .",
    "evolutionary tracks in the @xmath0 diagram are presented in section 3 along with analytical expressions for timespans of various phases , braking indices and other properties of the tracks .",
    "the @xmath0 diagram is divided into strips delineated by tracks of constant magnetic field and mass inflow rate .",
    "each strip is divided into period bins and a histogram is constructed for the number of pulsars in each period bin .",
    "a curve for the expected number of pulsars as a function of period is calculated according to the model and compared with the histogram for each strip .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we model spin - down of a pulsar under the combined action of magnetic dipole radiation and propeller spin - down torques as @xmath9 adopting the model of menou , perna and hernquist ( 2001b ) with their notation .",
    "the neutron star will continue to act as a radio pulsar as long as the fall - back disk does not protrude into the light cylinder .",
    "if the disk were detached from the light cylinder , it would not exert any torque on the neutron star and its magnetosphere . assuming that the disk is attached to the light cylinder",
    ", the torque can be estimated as : @xmath10 \\cong-2\\dot{m}r_{lc}^2\\omega = -2\\dot{m}c^2/\\omega \\equiv -\\gamma/\\omega\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the mass inflow rate interacting with the light cylinder and being ejected from the disk ; @xmath11 is the light cylinder radius , and @xmath12 is the specific angular momentum extracted from the pulsar magnetosphere , since the keplerian rotation rate @xmath13 in the disk is small compared to the rotation rate @xmath14 of the neutron star and its magnetosphere . the parameter @xmath15 erg / s is the rate of energy loss of the neutron star due to the propeller torque ; @xmath16 is the mass inflow rate in units of @xmath17 gm / s",

    "pulsar activity will turn off at reaching a critical voltage ( the `` death lines '' , `` the death valley '' ) at a period satisfying @xmath66 ( see fig 1 ) .",

    "we find @xmath77 . at times close to @xmath75 evolution",
    "few pulsars are observed at late times ( long periods ) along the propeller spin - down tracks .",
    "therefore pulsar turnoff will not effect the distribution of pulsars in the @xmath0 diagram except for the lowest @xmath4 .",

    "a time dependent disk would reach @xmath78 gm s@xmath68on timescales @xmath79 yrs . if the disk is depleted before the pulsar completes its evolution the pulsar will switch to the pure dipole spin - down track corresponding to its magnetic field .",
    "the number @xmath80 of pulsars with magnetic field @xmath81 and mass inflow rate @xmath4 in a period interval @xmath82 at period @xmath39 is @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the birthrate of pulsars in the galaxy , and f(@xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , the fraction of the galactic disk volume in which pulsars of period @xmath39 and period derivative @xmath40 are observable , describes selection effects . for simplicity",
    "we take f(@xmath39 , @xmath40 ) to be constant , assuming that the variation in f(@xmath39 , @xmath40 ) is negligible compared to the variation of @xmath40 .",
    "we further assume that one and only one track ( @xmath85 ) passes through each point in the @xmath0 plane , such that the plane can be divided into strips separated by chosen ( @xmath85 ) tracks . for each strip",
    "we count the pulsars in equal sized period bins and construct the histogram of @xmath80 .",
    "we then choose a representative track ( @xmath86 ) for the strip such that the function @xmath87 = constant/@xmath88;@xmath89 matches the histogram .",

    "the model predicts that @xmath91 will increase in proportion to @xmath39 at short periods , and decrease in proportion to @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "the histograms do have this property .",
    "for each strip , we fit the histogram by choosing @xmath94 to have the average value for the strip and choosing @xmath95 such that @xmath54 is in the period bin with the maximum number @xmath96 of pulsars .",

    "for the upper four boundary tracks @xmath102 s , and for the lowest boundary track at @xmath103 , @xmath104 s.",
    "the number distribution of pulsars in the @xmath0 plane is fitted remarkably well with the combined effect of dipole and propeller spin - down .",
    "the mass inflow rates range from a few 10@xmath105 gm / s for the youngest pulsars to a minimum of @xmath106 gm / s .",
    "the histograms for the four strips shown in fig.2 show reasonable agreement with representative model curves .",
    "the model curves representing the four strips are characterized by @xmath107 , @xmath108 s ( fig.2a ) ; @xmath109 , @xmath110 s ( fig.2b ) ; @xmath111 , @xmath110 s ( fig.2c ) and @xmath112 , @xmath113 s ( fig.2d ) .",
    "the agreement with the model is not sensitive to the choice of strip boundaries except for @xmath114 where a second peak appears in the histograms at @xmath115 s , as seen in fig.2d .",
    "this excess may reflect disk depletion resulting in pulsars dropping down , from many propeller spin - down tracks at higher @xmath81 and @xmath4 , to their corresponding pure dipole spin - down tracks at periods close to death lines .",
    "@xmath54 is found to vary between 0.15 s and 0.8 s. from eq.(7 ) , the limited range of @xmath54 suggests a correlation between @xmath116 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a correlation is not expected physically .",
    "it arises because a model with constant @xmath4 is used to represent the real spindown which occurs under a time - dependent @xmath5 .",
    "the period @xmath54 reflects the value of @xmath4 at time @xmath117 , when @xmath40 is minimum . to understand the effect in a simple way ,",
    "suppose at @xmath118 the dipole and propeller torques experienced by the pulsar are equal .",
    "suppose the mass inflow rate follows a power law decay @xmath119 .",
    "the pulsar is initially evolving down its dipole spindown track , with @xmath120 .",
    "we can define a @xmath121 , the turning point into the propeller track , according to the current @xmath5 . from eq.(7 ) , @xmath122 . for early times",
    "one can imagine the pulsar moving along its dipole track with @xmath120 while the junction with the propeller track at the current @xmath5 moves down the dipole track , ahead of the pulsar , but at a slower rate @xmath124 . at @xmath125 , @xmath126 and",
    "the pulsar is just turning into its current propeller track .",
    "for @xmath127 , the pulsar follows its current propeller track while the track itself continues to shift towards the bottom - right corner of the @xmath0 diagram , as @xmath5 continues to decrease . to derive the form of @xmath5",
    "let us use the observation that @xmath128 is similar for all pulsars .",
    "taking @xmath110 s gives @xmath129 .",
    "dipole spindown ( eq.(6 ) ) until @xmath125 yields @xmath130(yr)@xmath131 s or @xmath132(yr ) .",
    "thus we find that @xmath133(gm / s)@xmath134(yr)@xmath68 , that is , @xmath135 . for @xmath136 , @xmath137 yr and @xmath138 gm / s are obtained .",
    "the application here to all pulsars accross the @xmath0 diagram and its success in fitting the pulsar distribution require and support the presence of low mass , low @xmath4 disks , which are active for pulsar lifetimes of the order of @xmath139 yrs and remain attached to the light cylinder .",
    "the time dependence of the disk and the mass inflow rate it supplies could be incorporated in a more detailed calculation .",
    "the self similar isolated thin disk models with a power law decay of @xmath5 were employed by menou , perna and hernquist ( 2001b ) who point out that for the crab pulsar , psr b0540 - 09 and psr b1509 - 58 , thin disks in the @xmath4 ranges indicated by the braking indices of these pulsars are consistent with observational constraints in the optical though most of the disk luminosity would be in the uv where detections are much harder . for the vela pulsar",
    "only a very small and highly inclined disk could be compatible with observational constraints . according to the classification of alpar ( 2001 ) disks",
    "are present around all classes of young neutron stars , providing accretion for axps and acting as propellers on dtns and rqnss . for two axps and the rqns in cas",
    "a luminosities predicted by thin disk models are ruled out or tightly constrained by observations in the optical and ir ( coe & pightling 1998 , hulleman et al 2000 , hulleman , van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2000 , kaplan , kulkarni & murray 2001 ) .",
    "further , it is likely that disks under propeller boundary conditions are not standard thin disks ( alpar 2001 ) .",
    "as the mass inflow is stopped at the disk - magnetosphere boundary and largely ejected from the system , the disk may be enshrined in a corona and outflow of ejected matter , possibly with larger effective area and softer spectrum .",
    "menou , perna and hernquist ( 2001a ) have shown that the thin disks may become neutral and stop evolving as thin disks .",
    "the transition would quench the disk s luminosity , but it would also suppress the dynamical evolution of the disk if the viscosity of mhd origin is no longer operational .",
    "however , a smaller but nonzero viscosity should be operating in a neutral disk .",
    "furthermore irradiation by the pulsar will probably keep the disk ionized and allow the mass inflow to continue , possibly as a power law decay .",
    "the minimum rotational energy loss rate of the pulsars is of the order of @xmath140 erg s@xmath68 .",
    "the luminosity of the irradiated disk may be shifted to different spectral bands ( perna and hernquist 2000 ) .",
    "the present application to the @xmath0 diagram shows no indication of an effect on the pulsar distribution due to depletion of the disk before pulsar turnoff , except possibly for the oldest pulsars , well advanced in their evolution on propeller spin - down tracks , dropping down to pure dipole tracks near death lines .",
    "this may indicate that there is no separate disk timescale .",
    "disks interacting with pulsars via propeller torques may be driven by these torques to evolve on the propeller spin - down timescales of the pulsars .",
    "these problems , as well as the assumption that the disk remains attached to the light cylinder require further work on the coupling between the disk and the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation of the @xmath0 diagram will test the present model with independent random distributions of @xmath116 and @xmath4 and selection effects .",
    "we predict that some pulsars have braking indices @xmath141 , like the vela pulsar ( though the @xmath142 braking index measurement for this pulsar should be treated with some caution as its timing behaviour is dominated by interglitch relaxation ) .",
    "about 2/3 of all pulsars will be on the propeller spin - down branch , with @xmath143 , at @xmath144 .",
    "half of these pulsars will have negative braking indices , @xmath145 .",
    "measurement of braking indices is unfortunately very difficult since the timing behaviour is dominated by noise ( baykal et al 1999 ) and it seems also by interglitch recovery ( alpar and baykal 2001 ) .",
    "the model also predicts very small numbers @xmath146 of the oldest pulsars , which have long periods and large @xmath40 values .",
    "these pulsars would give magnetic fields @xmath147 , perhaps @xmath148 g with the combined dipole - propeller spin - down model .",
    "for these pulsars the pure dipole spin - down model would yield higher fields , extending into the magnetar range , and young ages .",
    "thus kinematic age measurements of pulsars wih long periods and large @xmath40 can distinguish between pure dipole spindown and propeller spindown .",
    "propeller spin - down also increases the rate of energy dissipation in pulsars and in neutron stars evolving under propeller torques after pulsar activity is over .",
