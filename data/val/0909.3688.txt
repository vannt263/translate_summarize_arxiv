    "the internet and its main application  the web  have been growing continuously in recent years .",
    "just in the last two years the web content has doubled in size from @xmath0 billion to over @xmath1 billion pages , according to results from google and yahoo @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such growth has been accompanied by a parallel increase of nefarious activities , as reported by  @xcite .",
    "the web represents a very appealing platform for various types of electronic fraud , of which phishing and typosquatting are two examples .",
    "_ phishing _ is the well - known activity aimed at eliciting sensitive information ",
    "e.g. , usernames , passwords and credit card details  from unsuspecting users .",
    "it typically starts with a user being directed to a fake web site with the look - and - feel of a legitimate , familiar and/or well - known web site .",
    "consequences of phishing can range from denial - of - service to full - blown identity theft , followed by real financial losses . only in 2007 ,",
    "more than 3 billion u.s .",
    "dollars were lost to such attacks  @xcite .",
    "_ typosquatting _ is the practice of registering domain names that are typographical errors ( or minor spelling variations ) of well - known web site addresses ( target domains ) @xcite .",
    "it is often related to domain parking services and advertisement syndication , i.e. instructing browsers to fetch advertisements from a server and blending them with content of the web site that the user intends to visit @xcite .",
    "in addition to displaying unexpected pages , typo - domains often display malicious , offensive and unwanted content , install malware ( @xcite ) and certain typo - domains of children - oriented web sites redirect users to adult content @xcite .",
    "worse yet , typo - domains of financial web sites can serve as natural platforms for _ passive _ phishing attacks .",
    "recent studies have assessed the popularity of both types of malicious activities @xcite .",
    "for example , in fall 2008 , mcafee alert labs found more than @xmath2 domains typosquatting on just the top @xmath3 web sites  @xcite . also , according to the anti - phishing working group , the number of reported phishing attacks between april 2006 and april 2007 exceeded @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the problem remains far from solved and continues to be a race between the web - fraudsters and the security community .",
    "our goal is to counter web - fraud by detecting domains hosting such activities .",
    "our approach is inspired by several recent discussions and results within the security community .",
    "security researchers and practitioners increasingly advocate transition to https for all web transactions , similar to that from telnet to ssh .",
    "eminent examples of such discussions can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent study  @xcite has pointed out the emergence of phishing attacks abusing ssl certificates .",
    "the main goal is to avoid raising the suspision of users by masquerading as legitimate `` secure '' site .",
    "this leads us to the following questions :    1 .",
    "how prevalent is https on the internet ? 2",
    ".   how _ different _ are ssl certificates used by web - fraudsters from those of legitimate domains ? 3 .",
    "can we use the information in the ssl certificates to identify web - fraud activities such as phishing and typosquatting , without compromising user privacy ?    0",
    "this paper makes several contributions , by answering the above questions : * first * , we present a novel technique to detect web - fraud domains using https .",
    "it relies on a classifier that analyzes certificates of such domains .",
    "we validate the classifier by training and testing it over data collected from the internet .",
    "the classifier achieves a detection accuracy of 80% and , in some cases , as high as 95% , with few false positives .",
    "our classifier is orthogonal to existing mitigation techniques and can be integrated with other methods that do not rely on https . *",
    "second * , to justify using https , we measure the overall prevalence of https in popular and randomly sampled internet domains .",
    "we then consider the popularity of https in the context of web - fraud by studying its use in phishing and typosquatting activities .",
    "we then analyze , for the first time , all fields of ssl certificates .",
    "we identify useful features and patterns that represent possible symptoms of web - fraud ; they guide the design of our detection technique .",
    "finally , our findings serve as an additional motivation for increasing the use of https , not only to guarantee confidentiality and authenticity , but also to combat web - fraud .    * contributions . *",

    "also the integration with pre - existing solutions could improve their efficiency in the context of potentially critical applications enforcing https .",

    "we are concerned with the public key certificate portion of x.509 . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we refer to the public key certificate format of x.509 as a _ certificate _ , or an _ ssl / https certificate_.    according to x.509 , a certification authority ( ca ) issues a certificate binding a public key to an x.500 distinguished name ( or to an alternative name , e.g. , an e - mail address or a dns - entry ) .",

    "the general structure of an x.509 v3 @xcite certificate is shown in figure [ fig : x509format ] . as discussed later in section [ sec : experiments ] , we analyze _ all fields _ for certificates of both legitimate and malicious domains .",
    "we first describe our data sets and how we collect them .",
    "we then present our analysis and show how these results guide the design of a classifier that detects web - fraud domains .",
    "our measurement data was collected mainly during september 2009 .",
    "it includes three types of domain sets : _ legitimate , phishing and typosquatting_. each domain is probed twice .",
    "we probe each domain for web existence ( by sending an http request ) and for https existence ( by sending an https request ) .",
    "if a domain responds to https , we harvest its ssl certificate .",
    "below , we describe the data sets and the state of http / https utilization in them , also summarized in table  [ table : data set - desc ] .",
    "* legitimate and popular domain data sets . *",
    "the following data sets are considered for measurements and analysis of popular and legitimate domains : + * @xmath5 * : @xmath6 most popular domains according to  @xcite + * @xmath5 * : @xmath6 random samples of  domain zone file , collected from verisign@xcite . + * @xmath5 * : @xmath6 random samples of  domain zone file , collected from verisign@xcite .",
    "@xcite is a subsidiary of amazon.com known for its web - browser toolbar and for its web site that reports traffic ranking of internet web sites .",
    "the company does not provide information on the number of users using its toolbar , but it claims several millions @xcite .",
    "we use  ranking as our measure of popularity of legitimate domains .",
    "we also randomly sample  and  to ensure an unbiased data - set . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we use , , and  to denote three respective data sets containing the domains or certificates harvested as described above .",

    "we consider this data set as a baseline for phishing domains .",
    "we find that a significant percentage  @xmath13  of these phishing web sites employ https .",
    "this represents a 5% increase over earlier measurements conducted in october 2008 .",
    "a similar trend has also been independently observed in a recent study by symantec @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we discovered a number of phishing domains using https ( @xmath1410% ) for which we can not obtain corresponding certificates , due to various ssl errors ( e.g. , illegal certificate size ) .",

    "* to collect ssl certificates of typosquatting domains we first identified the typo domains in our  and  data sets by using google s typo correction service  @xcite to identify possible typos in domain names .",

    "we identified the typosquatting domains in this set by detecting the parked domains among these typo domains using the machine - learning - based classifier proposed in @xcite .",

    "based on the analysis of https usage in our data sets , we attempt to answer the first question posed in section   [ sec : introduction ] and assess how prevalent is the usage of https today , we find that a significant percentage of popular and legitimate domains already use https , and so do a relevant percentage of phishing domains . as a result , we proceed by analyzing the differences between the certificates of legitimate and fraudulent web sites .      the goal of this analysis is to guide the design of our detection method , the classifier .",
    "one side - benefit of the analysis is that it reveals the differences between certificates used by fraudulent and legitimate / popular domains . in total",

    "19% of  certificates ( 24% and 22 % of   and , respectively ) use `` md5withrsaencryption '' .",
    "this feature has a much higher ratio ( 35% ) in  but only 26% in .",
    "the higher ratio for  suggests a possible correlation between phishing domain certificates and `` md5withrsaencryption '' signature algorithm .",
    "we were surprised that such a high percentage of legitimate domains is using `` md5withrsaencryption '' as the signature algorithm despite the well - known fact that rogue certificates can be constructed using md5 ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".      indicates whether the subject fields have some bogus values ( e.g. , `` st = somestate '' , `` o = someorganization '' , `` cn = localhost '' , ... ) .",
    "11% of  certificates ( 7% and 8% of  and , respectively ) satisfy this feature .",
    "this percentage is much higher ( 20% ) in  ( 29% in ) .",

    "we did not expect such a high percentage among legitimate domains .",
    "an interesting open question is to investigate the reason(s ) for all these certificates being self - signed ; however , this is out of the scope of our present work .",
    "the percentages of self - signed certificates in  and  are 36% and 53% , respectively .",
    "this is expected , since miscreants running such domains avoid leaving a trail by obtaining a certificate from a ca , which requires some documentation and payment . despite high ratios in legitimate sets",
    ", there is a significant variance between the ratios in the legitimate sets and  ( 8 - 12% ) .",
    "this variance is even larger between legitimate sets and  ( 25 - 29% ) .",

    "we use openssl 0.9.8k @xcite to validate certificates and find that 29% of  certificates ( 40% and 37% of  and ) fail verification .",
    "also , 36% and 70% of  and  certificates fail verification . the percentages in  and   sets are higher than in  maybe because these are random domains and mostly unpopular thus , having a valid certificate is not essential to these domains . 0",

    "such observations alone are not enough to discriminate phishing from popular / legitimate domains , but they can be combined with others for more effective discrimination .",
    "it is also interesting to see that a non - trivial percentage of phishing domains still obtain certificates from legitimate cas .",
    "the usa ( us ) and south africa ( za ) are responsible for around 50% and 20% ( respectively ) of the certificates for both legitimate / popular and malicious domains .",

    "2 .   around 20% of legitimate popular domains are still using the signature algorithm ",
    "md5withrsaencryption  despite its clear insecurity .",
    "3 .   a significant percentage ( @xmath27 ) of legitimate domain certificates are expired and/or self - signed .",
    "several user studies ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) show that an overwhelming percentage ( up to 70 - 80% in some cases ) of users ignore browser warning messages .",
    "this may explain the unexpected high percentages of expired and self - signed certificates that we find in the results of all our data sets .",
    "users simply ignore those warnings and this gives no incentive for organizations to update and pay attention to their certificates .",
    "4 .   duplicate certificate percentages are very high in phishing domains , which points to the possibility that phishers use certificates only to display the familiar lock icon in the browser , hoping that users will not pay attention .",

    "we acknowledge that our data sets should be extended through longer observation periods .",
    "furthermore , additional data sets of legitimate domains need to be taken into consideration , e.g. popular web sites from dns logs in different organizations and countries .",
    "data sets of typosquatting domains can be strengthened by additional and more effective name variations . also , we acknowledge that our phishing(typosquatting ) classifier may incur false positives when actually deployed",
    ". however , this is a common problem to many machine - learning - based mitigation solutions ( spam filtering and intrusion detections based on machine - learning algorithms ) and the number of false positives can be minimized by training the classifier on larger and more comprehensive data sets ( and continuing to do so for new samples ) .",
    "our classifier does not provide a complete standalone solution to the phishing(typosquatting ) threat since many domains do not have https .",
    "instead , integrated with pre - existing solutions ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , it improves their effectiveness in the context of potentially critical applications enforcing https and it contributes to face a complete range of malicious domains .    finally , we note that our classifier does not identify all kinds of typosquatting domains .",
    "for instance , typo - domains displaying unexpected pages and ads might have no incentive to use https , since they do not attempt to elicit private information from users .",
    "however , in the case of a further increase of https usage , our technique will be as a consequence increasing its effectiveness .",
    "generic typosquatting detection remains at the moment an interesting open issue that has not found effective solutions so far .",
    "* using information in certificates . * our results show significant differences between certificates of legitimate domains and those of malicious domains . not only is this information alone sufficient to detect fraudulent activities as we have shown , but it is also a useful component in assessing a web site s degree of trustworthiness , thus improving prior metrics , such as  @xcite .",
    "our method should be integrated with other techniques to improve the effectiveness of detecting malicious domains .    * keeping state of encountered certificates .",
    "* we deliberately chose to conduct our measurements as general as possible , without relying on user navigation history or on user specific training data .",
    "these components are fundamental for most current mitigation techniques  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we believe that keeping track of navigation history is detrimental to user privacy",
    ". however , our work yields effective detection by analyzing certain coarse - grained information extracted from server certificates and not specific to a user s navigation patterns .",
    "this is not privacy compromising as keeping fine - grained navigation history .    0 for example ,",
    "suppose that a user misspells the domain name of her bank and ends up in a passive phishing web site .",
    "it is quite likely that , in the phishing site s certificate , several fields would be encountered for the first time . according to our measurements ,",
    "this could be interpreted as an indicator of fraud . as future work",
    ", we plan to consider an enhanced version of our classifier assuming that it is possible to keep track of such privacy - insensitive information .",
    "* how malicious domains will adapt .",
    "* web fraud detection is an arms race and web - fraudsters are diligent and quickly adapt to new security mechanisms and studies that threaten their business .",
    "we hope that this work will raise the bar and make it more difficult for web - fraudsters to deceive users .",
    "if web - browsers use our classifier and start analyzing ssl certificate fields in more detail , we expect there will be two scenarios for web - fraudsters to adapt : ( 1 ) to get legitimate certificates from cas and leave a paper trail pointing to `` some person or organization '' which is connected to such an activity , ( 2 ) to craft certificates that have similar values like those that are the most common in those of legitimate domains .",
    "some fields / features will be easy to forge with legitimate values ( e.g. , country of issuer , country of subject , subject common and organization name , validity period , signature algorithm , serial number ... etc ) but for some this will not be possible ( issuer name , signature ... etc ) because otherwise the verification of the certificate will fail . in either case",
    "the effectiveness of web - fraud will be reduced .",
    "the authors in @xcite conducted a measurement study to measure the cryptographic strength of more than 19,000 public servers running ssl / tls .",
    "the study reported that many ssl sites still supported the weak ssl 2.0 protocol . also , most of the probed servers supported des , which is vulnerable to exhaustive search . some of the sites used rsa - based authentication with only 512-bit key size , which is insufficient .",
    "nevertheless , the authors showed encouraging measurement results such as the use of aes as default option for most of the servers that did not support aes .",
    "also , a trend toward using stronger cryptographic function has been observed over two years of probing , despite a slow improvement . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors performed a six - month measurement study on the aftermath of the discovered vulnerability in openssl in may 2008 , in order to measure how fast the hosts recovered from the bug and changed their weak keys into strong ones . through the probing of thousands of servers",
    ", they showed that the replacement of the weak keys was slow .",
    "also , the speed of recovery was shown to be correlated to different ssl certificate characteristics such as : ca type , expiry time , and key size .",
    "the article in @xcite presented a profiling study of a set of ssl certificates .",
    "probing around 9,754 ssl servers and collecting 8,081 ssl certificates , it found that around 30% of responding servers had weak security ( small key size , supporting only ssl 2.0 , ... ) , 10% of them were already expired and 3% were self - signed .",
    "netcraft @xcite conducts a monthly survey to measure the certificate validity of internet servers .",
    "recently , the study showed that 25% of the sites had their certificates self - signed and less than half had their certificates signed by valid ca .",
    "symantec @xcite has observed an increase in the number of urls abusing ssl certificates . only in the period between may and june 2009 ,",
    "26% of all the ssl certificate attacks have been performed by fraudulent domains using ssl certificates .",
    "although our measurement study conducts a profiling of ssl certificates , our purpose is different from the ones above .",
    "we analyze the certificates to show how malicious certificates are different from benign ones and to leverage this difference in designing a mitigation technique .",
    "the importance and danger of web - fraud ( such as phishing and typosquatting ) has been recognized in numerous prior publications , studies and industry reports mainly due to the tremendous financial losses @xcite that it causes .",
    "one notable study is @xcite which analyzed the infrastructure used for hosting and supporting internet scams , including phishing .",
    "it used an opportunistic measurement technique that mined email messages in real - time , followed the embedded link structure , and automatically clustered destination web sites using image shingling . in @xcite ,",
    "a machine learning based methodology was proposed for detecting phishing email .",
    "the methodology was based on a classifier that detected phishing with 96% accuracy and false negative rate of 0.1% .",
    "our work differs since it does not rely on phishing emails which are sometimes hard to identify . an anti - phishing browser extension ( antiphish ) was given in @xcite .",
    "it kept track of sensitive information and warned the user whenever the user tried to enter sensitive information into untrusted web sites .",
    "our classifier can be easily integrated with antiphish . however , antiphish compromised user privacy by keeping state of sensitive data .",
    "other anti - phishing proposals relied on trusted devices , such as a user s cell phone in @xcite . in @xcite , the authors tackled the problem of detecting malicious web sites by only analyzing their urls using machine - learning statistical techniques on the lexical and host - based features of their urls .",
    "the proposed solution achieved a prediction accuracy around 95% .",
    "other studies measured the extent of typosquatting and suggested mitigation techniques .",
    "wang , ed al .",
    "@xcite showed that many typosquatting domains were active and parked with a few parking services , which served ads on them .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that , for nearly 57% of original urls considered , over 35% of all possible url variations existed on the internet .",
    "surprisingly , over 99% of such similarly - named web sites were considered phony .",
    "@xcite devised a methodology for identifying ads - portals and parked domains and found out that around 25% of ( two - level ) .com and .net domains were ads - portals and around 40% of those were typosquatting .",
    "mcafee also studied the typosquatting problem in  @xcite .",
    "a set of 1.9 million single - error typos was generated and @xmath28 suspected typosquatting domains were discovered . alarmingly , the study also found that typosquatters targeted children - oriented domains .",
    "finally , mcafee added to its extension site advisor  @xcite some capabilities for identifying typosquatters .",
    "user studies analyzing the effectiveness of browser warning messages indicated that an overwhelming percentage ( up to 70 - 80% in some cases ) of users ignored them . this observation  confirmed by recent research results",
    "( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite) might explain the unexpected high percentage of expired and self signed certificates that we found in the results of all our data sets .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a solution to simplify the process ( for the users ) of authenticating the servers public keys ( or ssl certificates ) by deploying a set of semi - trusted collection of network servers that continuously probed the servers and collected their public keys ( or ssl certificates ) . when the user was exposed to a new public key ( ssl certificate )",
    ", he referred to these semi - trusted servers to verify the authenticity of public keys ( ssl certificates ) .",
    "we conclude that , to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has explored the web - fraud problem in the context of https and proposed analyzing server - side ssl certificates in more detail .",
    "our work yields a detailed analysis of ssl certificates from different domain families and a classifier that detects web - fraud domains based on their certificates .",
    "in this paper , we study the prevalence of https usage in popular and legitimate domains as well as in the context of web - fraud , i.e. , phishing and typosquatting . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first effort to analyze information in ssl certificates to profile domains and assess their degree of trustworthiness .",
    "we design and build a machine - learning - based classifier that identifies fraudulent domains using https based solely on their ssl certificates , thus also preserving user privacy .",
    "our work can be integrated with pre - exisiting detection techniques to improve their effectiveness in the context of potentially critical applications enforcing https .",
    "finally , we believe that our results may serve as a motivating factor to increase the use of https on the web , showing that besides its intended benefits of confidentiality and authenticity , the use of https can help identifying web - fraud domains ."
