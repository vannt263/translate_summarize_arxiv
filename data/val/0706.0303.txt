    "fusion cross sections of two heavy nuclei at sub - barrier energy have been studied extensively for last several years , since it was realized that the experimental measurements are enhanced by several orders of magnitude over the predictions of a simple barrier penetration model ( bpm ) at energies near and below the coulomb barrier @xcite . in this bpm picture ,",
    "fusion reaction at sub - barrier energies is governed by the tunneling through the columb barrier followed by an absorption inside the barrier which is often simulated through an incoming wave boundary condition .",
    "since bpm model is one dimensional in nature , it fails to explain sub - barrier fusion enhancement and broad spin distribution for several systems as heavy ion fusion is a complex process involving tunneling in multi - dimensions .",
    "although several theoretical models ( both macroscopic and microscopic ) have been proposed to account for this large sub - barrier fusion enhancement , the most successful model that has emerged out of these studies is the description of fusion within a coupled channel framework where the presence of couplings to various low lying inelastic and transfer channels are treated explicitly . under certain approximation",
    ", the channel couplings result in a distribution of barriers , one or more of which having height less than the original coulomb barrier , thus giving large enhancement .",
    "therefore , a better understanding of the fusion process followed through the distribution of barriers which can be obtained from the second derivative of the product of the fusion cross section with energy @xcite . in most experiments ,",
    "fusion cross sections have been measured down to the @xmath4 level and the coupled channel calculations have been quite successful in reproducing the general trends of the measured yields .",
    "while efforts are still being put to improve upon the techniques of these calculations to understand the nature of fusion enhancement and the associated barrier distribution , some of the early @xmath5 induced measurements at extreme sub - barrier energies @xcite ( cross section below the @xmath6 level for systems like @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) have brought out new surprises which show supression in fusion cross section with respect to the same coupled channel calculations that explains the enhancement at sub - barrier energies .",
    "subsequent measurements of fusion excitation functions for many other systems like @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath2 , and @xmath12 @xcite , together with analysis @xcite suggest that fusion hindrance is a general phenomena expected to occur for all the systems at extreme sub - barrier energies irrespective of the @xmath13 value of the reactions .",
    "the most striking feature of these measurements is sharp increase of the logarithmic derivative @xmath14/de$ ] with decreasing energies which can not be reproduced with normal coupled channel calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations also fail to explain the behavior of @xmath15-factor which shows a maxima at deep sub - barrier energies particularly for ( near ) symmetric systems .    to resolve these anomalies ,",
    "several models have been proposed .",
    "one of the earlier model which has been successful in explaining the fusion suppression for most of the systems was first proposed by misicu and esbensen @xcite where coupled channel calculations are carried out using a modified ion - ion potential that includes a repulsive core in addition to the normal double - folding potential with m3y interaction .",
    "the resulting potential is much more shallower as compared to standard double - folding potential . both shallower pocket and thicker potential barrier result in fusion hindrance at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "based on this potential , coupled channel calculations have also been carried out for symmetric light system like @xmath16 to extrapolate @xmath15 factor at deep sub - barrier energies which is of interest in astrophysical studies @xcite and also to explain fusion hindrance of highly asymmetric @xmath2 system @xcite .",
    "however , the above model provides only part of the explanation , but can not be the complete picture as the shallow model has no potential pocket to trap higher angular momenta and also fusion is not possible below the cut - off energy which is a technical drawback .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath7 system , the minimum value of the potential pocket @xmath17 mev which is about @xmath18 mev below the coulomb barrier .",
    "this would imply that fusion cross section @xmath19 will vanish for @xmath20 although compound nucleus formation is still possible as long as @xmath21 is positive i.e. compound nucleus can in principle be formed down to a threshold energy of @xmath22 mev .",
    "the experimental measurements also do not suggest a sharp cut - off in @xmath19 for @xmath23 .",
    "the approach of misicu and esbensen is based on the sudden picture where the nuclear reaction takes place so rapidly that the colliding nuclei overlap with each other without changing their density .",
    "fusion of two nuclei has also been studied in the adiabatic picture where fusion trajectory is obtained after optimizing in other collective variables like neck and mass asymmetric degrees of freedom .",
    "both adiabatic and sudden approaches may lead to the similar results in the region where the colliding nuclei do not overlap significantly . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors consider the fission like adiabatic potential energy surface with neck configuration after the colliding nuclei come in contact with each other .",
    "their model consists of a capture probability in the two body potential pocket followed by the penetration of the adiabatic one body potential to reach a compound state after the touching configuration .",
    "similarly , there are models based on density constrained time dependent hartree - fock formalism which are used to estimate fusion cross sections at deep sub - barrier energies @xcite with varying degrees of success .",
    "it is also found that the deep sub - barrier suppression patterns are different for different systems .",
    "the precision measurement of fusion cross sections for @xmath2 system at deep sub - barrier energies show a steep but almost saturated logarithmic slope @xcite unlike earlier @xmath5 induced reactions where logarithmic slope increases with decreasing energy .",
    "this has been interpreted as the quantum decoherence effect of the channel wave functions caused by the coupling to the thermal baths @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic method of ref .",
    "@xcite has not been applied to @xmath2 system and also the shallow potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite can not explain this suppression pattern unless coupling to transfer channel is included with increased coupling strength @xcite .",
    "recently , an improved coupled channel method has been suggested @xcite to explain the fusion supression pattern of @xmath24 and @xmath2 systems .",
    "the use of the variable damping factor simulates a smooth transition between the two - body and the adiabatic one - body state .",
    "while the deep sub - barrier suppression seems to be a general feature for many systems , another recent measurements of the fusion cross section for @xmath3 system @xcite shows no suppression although data exists for both above and deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "it is interesting to note that a normal coupled channel calculation using breakup coupling with standard ion - ion potential can explain the above experimental observations quite well .",
    "therefore , the fusion reaction study at sub - barrier energy has now become a controversial topic and requires further investigations .    in this work",
    ", we propose a hybrid coupled channel model based on both sudden and adiabatic pictures as follows .",
    "initially , the colliding partners are required to overcome the conventional coulomb barrier through tunneling along the radial direction .",
    "after tunneling this sudden barrier at @xmath25 , the di - nuclear system rolls down upto the bottom of the pocket at @xmath26 . since beyond @xmath27 ,",
    "the sudden potential becomes repulsive , the radial motion becomes slower and the di - nuclear system undergoes shape relaxation making a transition to the mono - nuclear regime that subsequently leads to complete fusion .",
    "it will be shown in this work that the shape relaxation involves a second tunneling through an adiabatic barrier along the neck degree of freedom .",
    "the coupled channel calculations based on this double penetration model is able to explain the deep sub - barrier suppression pattern for several systems including @xmath2 experimental data .",
    "although the present formalism is quite similar in spirit to that of two step model of ref.@xcite , the second tunneling in this work is calculated explicitly along the neck direction .",
    "it is argued that for highly asymmetric projectile target combinations , the tunneling along the neck degree is not essential and the transition to adiabatic trajectory occurs automatically once the system overcomes the sudden coulomb barrier .",
    "this feature , at least qualitatively , may explain why @xmath3 system does not show any deep sub - barrier fusion hindrance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we take two examples of ion - ion potentials , one based on akuyz - winther ( aw ) parameterization and second one , a recently introduced m3y+repulsion ( m3yr ) double folding potential @xcite .",
    "these potential models are sudden in nature .",
    "the adiabatic aspect is incorporated by adding an extra term due to neck formation which is estimated using a simple macroscopic model of nuclear shape evolution .",
    "it is shown that the adiabatic potential has a barrier along the neck direction which the fusing system needs to overcome while making a transition from a di - nuclear to a mono - nuclear regime .",
    "the fusion cross sections are estimated using both adiabatic and sudden potential in one dimension . in section iii",
    ", we propose a coupled channel formalism based on a double penetration model which explains various aspects of experimental measurements at deep sub - barrier energy .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the ion - ion potential is one of the important factor that governs the reaction mechanism at sub - barrier energy .",
    "attempts have been made to learn about the nuclear part of the ion - ion potential at short distances from the measured fusion cross sections at deep sub - barrier energies using inversion technique @xcite .",
    "although the inverted potentials for many systems are found to be thicker than phenomenological potentials and may partly explain fusion hindrance , the inversion procedure is based on the assumption that the experimental data can be fully explained on the basis of coupled channel calculations and ignores any additional dynamical effects which may be playing important role at short distances .",
    "we will discuss about one such missing dynamical component in the subsequent section . in the following ,",
    "we consider only the ion - ion potentials which are of sudden and adiabatic nature .",
    "the purpose here is to examine how much the deep sub - barrier fusion process is affected by the shape of the ion - ion potential in the nuclear interior region .      as part of the sudden ion - ion potential , we use both akuyz - winther ( aw ) and the m3y+repulsion double - folding potential ( m3yr ) .",
    "the parameterized form of aw potential is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an adjustable parameter used to reproduce the barrier height of double - folded potential with normal m3y interaction . here",

    "the blue curve is the wood - saxon ( ws ) parameterization that reproduces the m3yr potential in the region of interest . for m3yr potential ,",
    "we use this ws parameterization in calculations for convenience . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the parameters are so adjusted that both aw and m3yr potentials result in same barrier height , but differ significantly in the nuclear interior region .",
    "the m3yr potential is more shallower as well as more thicker as compared to the aw potential .",
    "these two aspects of m3yr potential result in the reduction of fusion cross section at deep sub - barrier energies . as mentioned before ,",
    "these potentials are of sudden nature where the shape of the nucleon density distributions are kept frozen .",
    "this approximation is valid if the relative motion is fast enough so that there is no time for internal rearrangements .",
    "when the relative motion slows down , the potential becomes adiabatic and the presence of other degrees of freedoms ( like neck and mass asymmetry ) can not be ignored . in the following ,",
    "we consider an adiabatic correction to these sudden potentials which is shown to be important at nuclear interior region .     and radius @xmath50 .",

    "are considered three independent collective variables which affect the fusion - fission dynamics . however , some macroscopic models as in refs . @xcite and @xcite consider the neck degree of freedom as a collective variable only for nuclear interior region @xmath57 and completely omit the neck dynamics at the approach stage assuming that neck is not an independent collective variable for @xmath65 .",
    "since the position of the coulomb barrier @xmath58 is much larger than the half density radius @xmath66 , the overlap density in the region at @xmath67 is very small as compare to the central saturation density .",
    "such a di - nuclear system which is formed purely due to geometrical overlap of the diffused nuclear surfaces at the approach stage ( @xmath68 ) will only affect the nuclear potential , but can not grow into a fully relaxed di - nuclear configuration .",
    "the role of neck dynamics has been investigated at the approach phase of reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite using realistic mass parameters and friction coefficients .",
    "the analysis suggests that a macroscopic model with neck variable leads to a relative motion of the nuclei that is similar to the motion in a potential obtained in the frozen density approximation .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any further correction in the nuclear potential at the exterior region due to neck formation as the standard double folding potential or its equivalent parameterization already accounts for the overlap correction under the frozen density approximation .",
    "however , as the colliding nuclei overcome the coulomb barrier , the nucleon density in the neck region approaches the saturation value resulting in a nuclear interaction which is repulsive at some point @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "since the relative motion in @xmath44 direction becomes slower , the shape relaxation through neck growth ( beyond the geometrical overlap @xmath71 ) becomes meaningful at @xmath72 .",

    "the @xmath86 value is fixed at @xmath18 fm corresponding to the distance where m3yr potential has the pocket . ]",
    "the above expression is a simple cubic order polynomial which vanishes at @xmath87 and has a minimum at @xmath88 as long as @xmath89 . between @xmath87 and @xmath90 ,",

    "[ fig4 ] , for @xmath95 , the height of the minimum at @xmath93 is higher than the value at @xmath87 . since the state at @xmath93 is metastable , neck relaxation is not favored until the system reaches @xmath96 which corresponds to a inter nuclear separation of @xmath97 ( say @xmath86 ) . at @xmath96 ( i.e. @xmath98 ) , @xmath99 at @xmath87 and @xmath99 at @xmath93 are degenerate ( both are zero ) .",
    "so , neck relaxation is possible i.e. the system can make transition from the di - nuclear state at @xmath87 to a mono - nuclear state at @xmath93 after overcoming the barrier at @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath100 , @xmath99 at @xmath93 is always lower than @xmath99 at @xmath87 so that neck relaxation is possible for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can define @xmath86 as the adiabatic distance at which the di - nuclear state in principle can make transition to a mono - nuclear state through shape relaxation .",
    "the value of @xmath86 varies depending on how @xmath102 is defined i.e. whether it represents half density or hard sphere radius .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the plot of adiabatic potential as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "since neck potential is metastable for @xmath109 , we set @xmath110 for @xmath109 and estimate @xmath111 for @xmath101 which adds a negative correction to eq .",
    "[ ad ] . for the adiabatic plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have taken m3yr for @xmath107 and fixed @xmath49 fm . note that the potential in fig.[fig4]b represents the adiabatic potential @xmath85 in the neck direction where as the black curve in fig.[fig1 ] represents the adiabatic potential as a function of @xmath44 for an optimum neck opening ( @xmath112 ( see eq . [ v1 ] ) . it may be mentioned here that the choice of m3yr for @xmath107 part is purely arbitrary .",
    "the adiabatic correction can be added to the aw parameterization as well .",
    "it is only to show that since the correction begins at @xmath101 , the adiabatic corrected potential is no longer repulsive and also the potential pocket does not exist any more .",
    "the fusion reaction is still possible by tunneling through this adiabatic potential even for @xmath113 which was problematic with pure m3yr potential .",
    "another important aspect is that the adiabatic potential is always thiner than its sudden counterpart .      to demonstrate how the shape of the nuclear potential in the interior region affects the deep sub - barrier fusion cross section , we first consider a simple one dimensional barrier penetration model ( bpm ) , although coupled channel calculations are carried out later on to explain the experimental data .",

    "it is shown here only to demonstrate the basic difference between aw type of potential which is commonly used in many coupled channel calculations and the m3yr double folding potentail with short distance repulsive correction which has been proposed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain deep sub - barrier suppression .",
    "as expected , the m3yr potential being thicker and shallower shows fusion suppression as compared to aw potential ( see blue and red curves in fig . [ fig2]a ) . in case of aw potential , the @xmath124 asymptotically",
    "saturates with decreasing energy where as calculations with m3yr potential shows a sharp increase in @xmath124 with decreasing energy , ( see corresponding red and blue curves in fig . [ fig2]b ) a similar trend as found in experimental measurements .",
    "however , this could be an artifact of shallow nature of the m3yr potential which results in an abrupt cut - off of fusion cross section for energy @xmath130 mev .",
    "in reality , the di - nuclear configuration has to move towards a mono - nuclear configuration followed by compound nucleus formation .",
    "therefore , it will be more appropriate to use an adiabatic potential which is of sudden nature for @xmath131 and truly becomes adiabatic for @xmath132 ( see black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the results obtained using the adiabatic potential .",
    "note that using the adiabatic potential , it is now possible to estimate fusion cross section for @xmath133 and also @xmath124 shows saturation as one finds in case of aw potential . in the present work",
    ", we have added adiabatic correction to m3yr sudden potential only to show how the cut - off effect can be eliminated , although adiabatic correction is also applicable to aw potential for @xmath134 .",
    "in the conventional picture , fusion occurs automatically once the fusing system overcomes the coulomb barrier . while passage over this coulomb barrier at @xmath25 is the necessary condition for fusion , it is not sufficient enough to ensure that fusion will lead to compound nucleus formation .",
    "further nuclear shape evolution is necessary for the di - nuclear system to make transition from the initial sudden trajectory to final adiabatic trajectory .",
    "if the system follows only the sudden trajectory , fusion leading to compound nucleus formation is not possible as the potential becomes repulsive beyond @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , it will be more appropriate to study fusion using the adiabatic trajectory ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) which has been obtained minimizing over the neck coordinate , i.e. by allowing the system to relax from @xmath87 to @xmath93 .",
    "however , tunneling through the adiabatic trajectory alone may overestimate the fusion probability particularly at deep sub - barrier energy unless the barrier along the neck direction is taken into account . as shown in fig.[fig4 ] , a barrier along the neck direction exists between @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) having a maximum height at @xmath98 and is given by ( estimated from eq.[vneck ] at @xmath96 and @xmath138 ) , @xmath139 and vanishes at @xmath140 .",
    "recall that we have now three different distance parameters , @xmath58 ( position of the coulomb barrier ) , @xmath86 ( the distance at which neck relaxation possible ) and @xmath69 ( the distance at which the sudden potential has a minimum ) . since , for fusion of stable nuclei , short distance repulsion and neck relaxation requires significant nuclear density overlap , we expect @xmath141 .",
    "ideally , fusion process should be studied using the two dimensional adiabatic potential as defined in eq.[ad ] which , for a given mass asymmetry , depends on both elongation and neck degree of freedoms . in the absence of such a dynamical tunneling calculation in multi - dimensions , we propose here a simple two step model as follows . first the system needs to tunnel through the coulomb barrier at @xmath142 which can be estimated using wkb or hill - wheeler approximation . since for @xmath109 the potential is sudden in nature , this tunneling is same as what is being used under frozen density approximation and the di - nuclear system follows the sudden trajectory until adiabatic transition becomes favorable at @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , after overcoming the coulomb barrier , the system rolls down upto the point @xmath26 beyond which the potential becomes repulsive .",
    "since the fusing di - nuclear system can not proceed in reducing @xmath44 direction beyond @xmath69 , it undergoes shape relaxation at @xmath72 and is captured into the adiabatic valley that ultimately leads to compound nucleus formation .",
    "however , for adiabatic transition ( moving from @xmath87 to @xmath144 along neck direction ) , the system needs to overcome a barrier of height @xmath145 at @xmath69 or at @xmath86 with available energy @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the pocket minimum .",
    "the fusion cross section can be written as ,    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the tunneling probability through the sudden barrier at @xmath58 with energy @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the adiabatic tunneling probability in the neck direction at @xmath26 with energy @xmath152 .",
    "the above factorization is approximate and can be justified for the fact that at the approach stage ( @xmath153 ) , the relative motion is fast enough over the neck relaxation time and at the nuclear interior stage ( @xmath72 ) , the neck grows rapidly as relative motion slows down .",
    "so , the total tunneling probability is written as the product of two factors , the first tunneling along the relative degrees of freedom at @xmath25 and second tunneling along the neck degree of freedom at @xmath98 or @xmath69 . for sub - barrier energy ,",
    "the second tunneling is almost unity , but provides hindrance for fusion at deep sub - barrier energies .    for simplicity",
    ", we will use hill - wheeler approximation given by eq.[hill ] to estimate the above two tunneling probabilities . under this approximation , it is now equivalent to say that the second tunneling needs to be calculated through a neck barrier , @xmath154 at energy @xmath150 . in the above equation , @xmath147 is the potential minimum at @xmath69 , @xmath155 is the maximum neck barrier at @xmath94 and the last term represents the rotational energy of the mononuclear configuration at @xmath156 and @xmath94 .",
    "however , for simplicity , we use the same term @xmath157 as in eq.[bar1 ] .",
    "although this is an over simplification , the results will not be affected much as the second tunneling is important only at deep sub - barrier energy where higher partial waves do not have significant contributions .    in the present model",
    ", the adiabatic neck barrier @xmath158 can be written as @xmath159 as an example , for @xmath7 system , the neck barrier @xmath160 mev if we consider a nominal @xmath161 mev@xmath64 .",
    "assuming @xmath162 mev for m3yr potential , the adiabatic barrier will have a height of about @xmath163 mev .",
    "therefore , fusion cross section will be suppressed at a threshold energy @xmath164 mev which is consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "similarly , for light symmetric system like @xmath16 , the neck potential @xmath155 is about 1 mev .",
    "this system should have an adiabatic neck barrier of the order of 3.5 mev where @xmath147 of 2.5 mev has been assumed @xcite .",
    "next we will examine whether fusion hindrance will occur for all projectile target combinations .",
    "all along we have been arguing that the shape relaxation requires transition from @xmath87 to @xmath93 which is separated by a barrier at @xmath165 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "an important aspect which we have not considered yet is the magnitude of initial neck radius @xmath166 which is formed purely due to geometrical overlap of the diffused nuclear surfaces . in an approximate way we can estimate an upper limit of @xmath166 by assuming that two times the geometrical neck radius ( the diameter of the cylinder ) should not exceed the length of the cylinder ,",
    "@xmath167 this gives an acceptable solution , @xmath168 for symmetric projectile target combinations .",
    "we generalise this expression for asymmetric combinations as well @xcite , @xmath169 at @xmath83 , @xmath166 turns out to be @xmath170 for all symmetric systems which is less than @xmath138 . at @xmath26 ,",
    "the geometrical neck @xmath166 lies to the left of @xmath165 and transition to @xmath90 requires further tunneling .",
    "therefore , for symmetric projectile target systems , fusion hindrance seems to be a general phenomena at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "however , for asymmetric projectile target combinations , @xmath166 can be different depending on the asymmetry . if @xmath171 , further tunneling is required for shape relaxation which will lead to fusion hindrance .",
    "on the otherhand , if @xmath172 , there is no barrier to tunnel through and shape relaxation occurs automatically .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath3 , @xmath173 and lies to the right of @xmath138 .",
    "thus , for this system , shape relaxation occurs automatically without any hindrance . using this model",
    ", we notice that @xmath2 system may undergo barrier tunneling in neck direction . however , the present model is too simple to give any quantitative prediction at which asymmetry supression will be absent .",
    "this is only to demonstrate the mechanism for fusion hindrance which may not be found for highly asymmetric combinations .",
    "the value of @xmath174 as given in eq.[v_ad ] is only an indicative and may not be valid for highly asymmetric system .",
    "further , the present macroscopic calculation does not include any shell correction which is very important at low excitation energy .",
    "therefore , in the actual coupled channel calculations , we will treat @xmath174 as a parameter which will be varied to fit the experimental measurements .",
    "the above double barrier penetration model can be extended to calculate fusion cross section using coupled channel formalism . in this formalism , the sudden tunneling probability @xmath175 is estimated as a weighted sum over the tunneling through a distributions of eigen barriers .",
    "this concepts was first introduced in @xcite that resulted in the computer code popularly known as ccfus @xcite .",
    "we use the same ccfus code with suitable modification ( ccfusm ) to incorporate the second tunneling phenomena . since , we use the parabolic approximation , the potential parameters of the model are @xmath123 , @xmath58 , @xmath176 ( corresponding to the sudden barrier ) and @xmath174 and @xmath177 for adiabatic barrier .",
    "the sudden potential parameters are fixed by fitting the fusion data around the coulomb barrier where as adiabatic parameters are varied to fit the data at deep sub - barrier energy .     as a function of @xmath129 for @xmath178 , @xmath7 and @xmath179 systems .",

    "this peak position correlates well to the threshold energy @xmath197 beyond which the experimental fusion cross section falls - off steeply .",
    "next , we apply the modified coupled channel ( ccfusm ) calculation using a second tunneling factor as discussed previously . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose @xmath198 , although these two parameters are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the barrier height @xmath192 is adjusted to reproduce the experimental data at deep sub - barrier energies . in fact , @xmath192 turns out to be same as that of @xmath197 .",
    "the blue curves show the results of ccfusm calculations which explain the data quite well .",
    "the @xmath124 is quite sensitive to the @xmath177 parameter . as an example , we have used a smaller @xmath199 mev for @xmath124 calculations for all the above three systems .",
    "the rise is still sharper as can be seen from the black curves in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath193 is an important parameter and needs to be estimated properly although we have set it to @xmath176 for simplicity .",
    "we also consider @xmath2 system for which new measurements of fusion cross sections are available at deep sub - barrier energies @xcite complementing existing above barrier measurements @xcite .",
    "unlike , @xmath5-induced reactions , the logarithmic derivative shows saturation as shown in fig .",
    "the coupled channel calculations can not reproduce the data ( see the red curves ) .",
    "the blue curves show the results of modified coupled channel calculations with @xmath200 mev and @xmath201 mev .",
    "the black curve in fig.[fig8]b is obtained using a higher @xmath193 of @xmath202 mev .",
    "note that the saturation phenomena can be understood using a suitable @xmath203 value .",
    "it may be mentioned here that in our model , @xmath124 will ultimately lead to a saturation value depending on the @xmath177 value .",
    "another measurable quantity of interest is the average spin value which is defined as @xmath204 fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows @xmath205 as a function of energy for @xmath7 system .",
    "although the results obtained using normal coupled channel calculations and ccfusm are identical at near and above barrier energies , the results differ at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "we have proposed a hybrid coupled channel model for fusion using an ion - ion potential which has same form as that of frozen density approximation at the nuclear exterior region and becomes adiabatic in the nuclear interior region where the potential strongly depends on both radial and neck degree of freedom .",
    "ideally , the tunneling probability should have been calculated through a two dimensional potential landscape .",
    "instead , we follow a two step approach under the assumption that initial radial motion is fast enough so that nuclear density is frozen at the approach stage and after passage over the coulomb barrier , the radial motion becomes slower and the neck degree of freedom becomes important .",
    "accordingly , the total tunneling probability is written as the product of two factors , one for tunneling through the coulomb barrier and the other one through the barrier along the neck direction . for energy above and just below the coulomb barrier ,",
    "the tunneling probability along the neck barrier becomes almost unity and the hybrid model is just the normal coupled channel model which is being used for fusion calculations .",
    "however , the second tunneling probability becomes significant only at deep sub - barrier energy which becomes responsible for fusion hindrance .",
    "it is also very important to use the right form of sudden ion - ion potential .",
    "the commonly used aw parameterization does not include any short distance repulsive correction . on the otherhand ,",
    "the m3yr potentail is much thicker and shallower as the repulsive parameters have been adjusted to fit the deep sub - barrier data under the assumption that shape of the ion - ion potential in the interior region decides the fusion hindrance and neglects any other effects of dynamical origin like transition to di - nuclear to mono - nuclear state through shape relaxation .",
    "therefore , we believe , both aw and m3yr potentials are two extreme representations and the actual sudden ion - ion potential should follow the intermediate behavior . therefore , in this work we use a simple code like ccfus which adopts parabolic approximation for tunneling calculations . as a result , whatever be the form of potential ,",
    "the tunneling probability is only sensitive to three parameters , barrier height , barrier width and barrier position .",
    "although , this is an over simplification particularly at deep sub - barrier energy , we still follow the ccfus approach to study the effect of tunneling along the neck direction on fusion cross section without giving much emphasis on the shape of the ion - ion potential in the nuclear interior region .",
    "interestingly , it is found that the magnitude of this adiabatic neck barrier @xmath174 is quite close to the threshold energy @xmath197 and can be written as @xmath206 where @xmath147 is the minimum of the potential pocket of the sudden potential and @xmath99 is the additional barrier due to neck formation which is estimated about @xmath207 mev to @xmath208 mev depending on the colliding systems .",
    "this finding is consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "our model also suggests that after a steep rise , the logarithmic derivative will attain saturation asymptotically .",
    "another important finding of this model is that the deep sub - barrier fusion hindrance is a general phenomena for all symmetric systems whereas hindrance may not be seen for highly asymmetric projectile target combinations , although it has not been possible to give a asymmetric cut - off above which fusion hindrance will be found .",
