    "island nucleation and growth during the early stages of thin film deposition has attracted much attention over the last few decades @xcite .",
    "the islands that arise from the aggregation of the deposited material form the building blocks for nanostructure growth @xcite and subsequent film morphology @xcite , and so are of direct technological interest .",
    "the growth process is amenable to monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , which in turn have inspired many theoretical analyses which revisit meanfield rate equations ( for example see references @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking aspect to arise from these models has been the identification of scale invariance in the growth process , exemplified in the island size distribution ( isd ) @xcite .",
    "it has been recognised that in order to understand the isd , one can not simply rely on mean field equations since they do not always yield the correct form for it @xcite and in some cases do not even display the fundamental scaling property seen in simulation and experiment @xcite .    in order to better understand the isd",
    ", we must consider the growth rate of an island that has nucleated on the substrate .",
    "it grows by capturing deposited monomers , which diffuse to it across the substrate .",
    "the growth rate of the island is therefore dependent on its capture zone , defined as the region of substrate closer to this island than to any other @xcite ; monomers deposited into the island s capture zone are more likely to diffuse to it than to any other competing island .",
    "this concept has been successfully used for the isd found in growth on both two- @xcite and one - dimensional substrates @xcite .",
    "the latter model is of particular interest , since it can be analysed in great detail , and it is the subject of the current paper .    recently there has been renewed interest in the capture zones and associated size distribution ( czd ) where it has been proposed that the czd follows the generalised wigner surmise @xcite . in particular , it has been suggested @xcite that the czd obeys @xmath2 where @xmath3 ^ 2\\ ] ] are normalisation constants so that @xmath4 and @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the capture zone size @xmath7 scaled to its average @xmath8 at any time @xmath9 in the aggregation regime @xcite .",
    "the aggregation regime is such that the island density is greater than the monomer density , so that further nucleation is a slow process compared to the island growth due to monomer capture .    despite the excellent visual comparisons between equation ( [ gws ] ) and mc data taken from the literature @xcite , the validity of the gws has already been challenged .",
    "shi et al .",
    "@xcite studied @xmath10 point island models in @xmath11 dimensions , finding that the czd is more sharply peaked than the gws suggests for @xmath12 and a better choice of @xmath13 rather than @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite also question the @xmath10 , @xmath16 gws form for the czd , proposing their own form based on a sophisticated theory for capture zone evolution in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "we also note that there is a conflict in the small and large size form of ( [ gws ] ) and that of the theory presented in @xcite for the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) nucleation and growth of point islands .",
    "the work in @xcite focused on the case with critical island size @xmath10 , where we impose the condition that @xmath17 monomers must coincide in order to nucleate a stable , immobile island .",
    "the analysis in @xcite utilises a fragmentation theory approach ( as described below ) which we consider to be physically reasonable .",
    "it is therefore of interest to ask whether a similar conflict exists for other critical island sizes . in this work",
    "we extend the 1-d point - island fragmentation approach to @xmath18 and show that the small - size conflict with @xcite holds for all non - negative integers @xmath0 . the case of @xmath10 in this model has recently been considered in @xcite , where the form of equation ( [ gws ] ) has been extended in light of mc simulation data . here",
    "we retain a focus on the comparison between the original gws of equation ( [ gws ] ) and the fragmentation model for general @xmath0 .    in @xcite a mc simulation was presented , where monomers are randomly deposited at rate @xmath19 onto a line of points which represents the substrate .",
    "the monomers diffuse ( with diffusion constant @xmath20 ) by nearest neighbour hops until they nucleate a new island , or are adsorbed by hopping onto an existing island .",
    "since nucleation is a rare event in the aggregation regime , it is assumed @xcite that the average monomer density @xmath21 in the gap ( length y ) between two neighbouring islands obeys its saturated form @xmath22 where we have set @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , this density profile is then used to predict the probability of a nucleation occurring at position @xmath7 in the gap , which we take to be proportional to @xmath24 . in adopting this form",
    ", it is assumed that the nucleation arises from the congregation of @xmath25 `` mature '' monomers that have explored their gap and lost memory of their deposition events .    in this work",
    "we will adopt the same approach as in @xcite and derive a gap - size evolution equation for @xmath26 . from this equation ,",
    "we obtain information on similarity solutions which involve a reduced gap size distribution function @xmath27 .",
    "we are then able to construct the czd under the assumption used in @xcite that due to the stochastic nature of the nucleation process there are no neighbour - neighbour gap size correlations in the system . under this assumption , we can write @xmath28    we shall then show that the small size form for @xmath29 given by equation ( [ eq : czd ] ) is different to that of equation ( [ gws ] ) .",
    "in particular , the small size power dependence from equation ( [ eq : czd ] ) will prove to be an odd power of @xmath30 , whereas equation ( [ gws ] ) always gives an even power for one - dimensional substrate .",
    "we also prove that the large - size forms in equations ( [ gws ] ) and ( [ eq : czd ] ) for the spontaneous nucleation model ( @xmath1 ) are in similar disagreement .",
    "we model the one - dimensional aggregation regime by regarding nucleated islands as points on a line . our aim is to obtain an equation that describes the evolution of the gaps between adjacent islands .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the number concentration of gaps of width @xmath7 at time @xmath9 .",
    "since any new nucleation event that occurs in a ` parent ' gap of width @xmath32 will result in the creation of two ` daughter ' gaps of widths @xmath7 and @xmath33 , it is clear that the evolution of the system of gap sizes can be interpreted as a fragmentation process .",
    "processes of this type are usually modelled by the linear fragmentation equation @xmath34 in the case of gap sizes , @xmath35 represents the rate at which gaps of width @xmath7 fragment ( due to nucleation ) and @xmath36 describes the distribution of gaps of width @xmath7 resulting from the fragmentation of a parent gap of width @xmath37 .",
    "since each new nucleation leads to the birth of only two daughter gaps , and since the total length of all the gaps is preserved , we require @xmath38 to satisfy @xmath39 to obtain appropriate functions @xmath40 and @xmath38 , as explained above , we follow the approach used by blackman and mulheran @xcite . therefore",
    ", we assume that , in the aggregation regime , the density of monomers in a gap of width @xmath32 is given by ( [ md ] ) .    by the reasoning given in the introduction",
    ", the probability of a new nucleation occurring in a gap of width @xmath32 may be taken as being proportional to @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the beta function . then , given that a nucleation event has caused a gap of width @xmath32 to fragment , with fragmentation rate @xmath43 , the probability that it will occur at a scaled position @xmath44 in @xmath45 \\subseteq [ 0,1]$ ] is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 since @xmath48 \\leftrightarrow x / y \\in [ x_0/y , x_0/y + dx / y ] \\leftrightarrow r \\in [ r_0,r_0 + dr]$ ] , the probability that the nucleation occurs at @xmath49 $ ] is given by @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath51 where @xmath52 so that ( [ bconds ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 and equation ( [ 1 ] ) therefore becomes @xmath54 a simple re - scaling of the time variable then yields the gap - size evolution equation @xmath55 this equation is a particular case of the linear , homogeneous fragmentation equation @xmath56 for some @xmath57 in which @xmath58 , a homogeneous function of degree zero , determines the number of daughter `` particles '' of size @xmath7 obtained when a parent `` particle '' of size @xmath37 fragments .",
    "there is a considerable literature on equations of this type , and various mathematical techniques have been used in the analysis of ( [ lhe ] ) .",

    "the questions of existence and stability , in an appropriately defined sense , of similarity solutions to fragmentation equations of homogeneous type have also been addressed in @xcite .    in the case of the gap fragmentation equation ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ as1 ] ) and ( [ as2 ] ) lead directly to the following result .",

    "the derivation of the asymptotics is non - trivial and requires the use of a multi - dimensional version of laplace s method .",
    "this is the content of the next two sections .",
    "the small @xmath30 behaviour of @xmath29 for arbitrary @xmath0 can be obtained immediately from part i of theorem [ theo : cr ] and equation ( [ eq : czd ] ) :    [ smalls ] for the critical island size @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 where @xmath29 is the 1-d czd .",

    "we remind the reader that @xmath109 is a * critical point of the third kind * of @xmath107 if it is an extremum point of @xmath113 on @xmath20 belonging to the boundary of @xmath20 through which pass two intersecting tangent lines , neither of which coincides with the tangent to the level curve @xmath114 at @xmath109 .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the blackman and mulheran model @xcite for the nucleation and growth of point islands on a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) substrate , based on a fragmentation equation approach , yields a capture zone distribution ( czd ) that is different to the generalised wigner surmise ( gws ) in equation ( [ gws ] ) @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics of the czd are measurable in mc simulation , allowing these theories to be tested , and we will present our analyses of simulations elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we will conclude this current work with a discussion of how the two theoretical approaches differ and how they might be reconciled .",
    "it is interesting to note that the justification for the relationship between the parameter @xmath141 in equation ( [ gws ] ) and the critical island size , as given in equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) , is based on the same physical model analysed in this paper . in @xcite ,",
    "the island nucleation rate is discussed in terms of the monomer density n , and the probability of @xmath25 monomers coinciding is used to give the nucleation rate as @xmath142 .",
    "this of course is exactly the physical basis we have used , so it is worthwhile considering why @xcite end up with different power - law behaviour for small capture zone sizes .    let us summarise the phenomenological arguments used in @xcite .",
    "firstly the authors consider the nucleation rate within capture zones with size @xmath30 , which have a relative density @xmath29 , using the mean field value of the monomer density @xmath143 .",
    "they then reconsider the nucleation rate within a small zone of size @xmath30 using the locally averaged monomer density . in one space dimension",
    ", they argue that this density @xmath144 . equating the two rates , @xmath145 yields their law for @xmath141 in 1-d nucleation so that @xmath146 for small @xmath30 .",
    "we note that recently the originators of equation ( [ gws ] ) have considered alternative forms to the gaussian tail following evidence from their own mc simulations with @xmath10 .    from our perspective , we see a number of problems with this argument .",
    "firstly , the method of constructing the two alternative nucleation rates appears internally inconsistent , using both the mean field monomer density @xmath143 and a local approximation .",
    "usually this approach would involve taking averages of the latter to reach consistency with the former @xcite , however this was not done in @xcite .",
    "the second criticism , more pertinent to this paper , is that the nucleation rate using the locally averaged monomer density within a capture zone has not been justified .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the authors revise their argument for two dimensional substrates and use a spatially dependent monomer density @xmath147 within a capture zone to derive the nucleation rate for the zone .",
    "this involves integrating @xmath148 over the zone , reminiscent of the approach used elsewhere for the two dimensional substrate @xcite , resulting in a different relationship @xmath149 which better fits monte carlo data . ,",
    "@xmath150 , with @xmath151 and @xmath152 being the island and circular capture zone radii .",
    "it is not clear what motivated the choice of boundary conditions for this form ; we would have expected the monomer density to be zero at the island edge , rising to a maximum at the capture zone radius so that its gradient is zero at this boundary @xcite . ]",
    "presumably , this type of modification can be taken forward to the 1-d case discussed here .",
    "following the same line of argument , we might take the local monomer density in a small capture zone size @xmath30 as that from two gaps of size @xmath153 , using the form of equation ( [ md ] ) above .",
    "if we do this , we will end up with the formula @xmath154 , thereby agreeing with the small - size czd behaviour we have derived in this work .",
    "although this does go some way to reconciling the two approaches , we consider that this line of reasoning is heuristic at best , and much prefer the more rigorous methods adopted in our work presented here in this paper .",
    "the second component of the gws in equation ( [ gws ] ) is the large - size behaviour of the czd . here",
    "too we see a conflict with the fragmentation theory approach we adopt , again despite the same physical basis for the models . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors are motivated by the idea of a large fluctuating capture zone being constrained by its neighbours , rather than any attempt to consider in detail how the nucleation process impacts on the large size czd behaviour . in this work",
    "we have been able to prove that for @xmath1 , the large size dependence of the czd following equation ( [ eq : czd ] ) mirrors that of the corresponding gap distribution @xmath27 . in particular , we have @xmath155 rather than the gaussian tail of equation ( [ gws ] ) .",
    "furthermore , whilst it remains unproved , we can conjecture that the czd for larger values of @xmath0 will similarly follow the asymptotics of the corresponding gsd and follow @xmath156 for some constants @xmath157 in stark contrast to the gaussian tail .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the gws of @xcite is in conflict with the asymptotic solutions to the fragmentation theory analysis of point island nucleation and growth in one dimension .",
    "given that the physical basis of the two approaches is the same , we believe that these differences show important failings of the gws .",
    "of course , this is not to claim that the blackman and mulheran model , embodied in equations ( [ md ] ) and ( [ eq : czd ] ) above , has been proven to be correct ; confrontation with simulation and experiment will ultimately arbitrate between these theories .",
    "along these lines , we note the recent analysis of the case of @xmath10 in @xcite , and our own detailed comparisons with extensive simulation data for @xmath158 presented in @xcite .                                            oneill k p , grinfeld m , lamb w , and mulheran p a 2011 gap size and capture zone distributions in one - dimensional point island nucleation and growth simulations : asymptotics and models , e - print arxiv:1110.2332 ( submitted to _ phys ."
