    "although jaffe ( 1983 ) , hernquist ( 1990 ) , and dehnen ( 1993 ) introduced their highly useful density - profile models to match the deprojected form of de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath11 model , these models do not immediately yield the types of structural quantities measured nightly by observers .",
    "for example , observers typically refer to a galaxy s ( projected ) half - light radius and surface density at this radius . on the other hand",
    ", modelers frequently use the navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 , hereafter nfw ) model  a modified version of hernquist s model  and report scale radii and scale densities ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) where the slope of the ( internal ) density profile equals @xmath14 . or , typically , they might report on the ` concentration ' , related to the ratio of @xmath13 with the average background density of the universe , or the ratio of @xmath12 with the halo s virial radius .",
    "recently , alternatives to both the nfw model , and it s generalization with arbitrary inner profile slope @xmath0 , have been shown to provide better fits to the density profiles of simulated dark matter halos ( e.g. , merritt et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter paper  i , and references therein ) .",
    "considering fits to galaxy- and cluster - sized dark matter halos built from hierarchical @xmath15cdm simulations , and fits to dark matter halos constructed from cold spherical collapses , two density models stand out ( paper  i ) .",
    "the first is einasto s ( 1965 ) model ; see tenjes , haud , & einasto ( 1994 ) for a more recent application .",
    "this model has the same functional form as srsic s ( 1963 , 1968 ) model but is applied to internal ( 3d ) density profiles rather than projected surface density profiles .",
    "although we will not be using einasto s model in this paper , having studied it in paper  i and graham et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter paper  ii ) , we note that it has recently been applied to halos by navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , diemand , moore , & stadel ( 2004b ) , and merritt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the second density model , by prugniel & simien ( 1997 ) , which _ is _ used here , is of particular interest because it is defined using two of the three parameters contained in srsic s @xmath1 ( light - profile ) model .",
    "indeed , the prugniel - simien model was developed to match the deprojected form of srsic s model .",
    "specifically , the ( projected ) effective radius @xmath16 and the ( projected ) profile shape @xmath10 are common to both .",
    "the third parameter in prugniel & simien s model , @xmath6 , an internal density term at @xmath7 , can readily be used to obtain the associated surface density , @xmath17 , at the projected radius @xmath18 .",
    "this model therefore allows one to directly compare the structural properties of simulated dark matter halos with the structure of real galaxies and clusters , and to do so using a better fitting function than the generalized nfw model .",
    "in addition , terzi & graham ( 2005 ) have already shown that the prugniel - simien model describes the deprojected light - profiles of real elliptical galaxies better than the jaffe , hernquist and dehnen models .",
    "for both real spheroidal stellar systems and simulated dark matter halos alike , we have been able to plot their location on diagrams of mass versus : profile shape , effective radius , effective surface density , and effective internal ( 3d ) density . in the latter three figures ,",
    "the galaxy - sized dark matter halos are observed to be consistent with the high - mass extension of ordinary elliptical galaxies .",
    "moreover , the cluster - sized dark matter halos are seen to coincide with the location of real galaxy clusters in all four diagrams , and possibly define a trend in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 diagrams .",
    "this is suggestive that the same ( mass - dependent ) physical processes are in operation in the real and simulated systems .    while it remains unclear as to why the simulated galaxy - sized halos do not follow the mass versus profile shape ( @xmath19 ) relation defined by real elliptical galaxies ( although see nipoti & ciotti 2006 ) , we have been able to use this observation to constrain the galaxy - to - halo size ratio . in order for ( dwarf and giant ) elliptical galaxies to be dark matter",
    "dominated at large radii , we show that this ratio must increase with galaxy mass .    due to the use of the prugniel - simien density - profile model",
    ", we have also been able to show , for the first time , the location of simulated dark matter halos in the kormendy ( 1977 ) diagram . within this plane of effective surface density versus effective radius , luminous elliptical galaxies",
    "are observed to follow the relation @xmath21 ( e.g. , hamabe & kormendy 1987 ; graham 1996 ; la barbera et al .",
    "intriguingly , the galaxy - sized dark matter halos also appear consistent with this relation .",
    "furthermore , we present a new diagram , and relation , using the internal ( 3d ) effective density . not only do the galaxy - sized dark matter halos follow the same linear trend defined by luminous elliptical galaxies , but the real galaxy clusters and cluster - sized dark matter halos follow their own linear relation which is offset in density by two orders of magnitude . such scaling laws refelct important regulatory mechanisms that dictate the formation and growth of galaxies and their dark matter halos , and as such these relations provide both inisght into these processes and useful constraints for galaxy modelling .    in the following section we present the mathematical form of the prugniel - simien model . in section",
    "3 we introduce the simulated and real data sets which are subsequently compared with each other in section  [ results ] . section  [ mass ] shows trends with mass while section  [ seccomp ] presents the @xmath22@xmath4 and the @xmath23@xmath4 diagrams .",

    "the density model presented in prugniel & simien ( 1997 , their equation  b6 ) was designed to match the deprojected form of srsic s @xmath1 ( 1963 ) function used for describing the projected distribution of light in elliptical galaxies .",

    "( 2004a ) .",
    "although a standard quantity , we do note in passing that the virial radii associated with these masses do not actually denote the outer boundary of each halo .",

    "the virial radii are @xmath481.5 times larger than the ( projected ) effective radii .",

    "it consists of 250 dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies spanning a range in absolute magnitude from @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xmath52-mag .",

    "<S> we have recently shown that the 3-parameter density - profile model from prugniel & simien provides a better fit to simulated , galaxy- and cluster - sized , dark matter halos than an nfw - like model with arbitrary inner profile slope @xmath0 ( paper  i ) . by construction , </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the prugniel - simien model equate to those of the srsic @xmath1 function fitted to the projected distribution . using the prugniel - simien model , we are therefore able to show that the location of simulated ( @xmath2 ) galaxy - sized dark matter halos in the @xmath3@xmath4 diagram coincides with that of brightest cluster galaxies , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , the dark matter halos appear consistent with the kormendy relation defined by luminous elliptical galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> given the shapes of the various density profiles , we are able to conclude that while dwarf elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters can have dark matter halos with effective radii of comparable size to the effective radii of their baryonic component , luminous elliptical galaxies can not . for increasingly large elliptical galaxies , with increasingly large profile shapes @xmath10 , to be dark matter dominated at large radii requires dark matter halos with increasingly large effective radii compared to the effective radii of their stellar component . </S>"
