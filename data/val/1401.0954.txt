    "the fruitful concept of the _ maximal globally hyperbolic development _ of cauchy data was introduced in 1969 by choquet - bruhat and geroch @xcite . these solutions to einstein s field equations have , in particular , the property of being uniquely determined ( up to isometries ) by the cauchy data on a cauchy surface .",
    "sometimes , however , such a maximal globally hyperbolic spacetime can be extended .",
    "the extension is not globally hyperbolic and hence there is a _ cauchy horizon _ whose topology and smoothness may in general be very complicated .",
    "a famous example is the taub solution @xcite , a two - parametric family of spatially homogeneous cosmological models with spatial @xmath1-topology .",
    "this solution can be extended through smooth complete cauchy horizons with @xmath1-topology to the taub - nut solutions @xcite . however , there are several non - equivalent extensions @xcite",
    ". moreover , there exist _ closed causal curves _ in the extended regions , which is a violation of causality .",
    "these unexpected properties have raised the question as to whether such pathological phenomena occur only under very special circumstances , like the high symmetry of the taub solution . or would quite general solutions in general relativity always suffer from such defects ? the former alternative is proposed in penrose s famous strong cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , according to which the maximal globally hyperbolic development of `` generic '' cauchy data is inextendible .",
    "this means that models like the taub solution would belong to a ( in some sense ) negligibly small subset of `` non - generic spacetimes '' .",
    "however , this hypothesis is far from being proven in the general case .",
    "the interesting features of the taub - nut models have motivated the investigation of larger classes of solutions with similar properties . in @xcite , moncrief studies _",
    "generalized taub - nut spacetimes _ with a @xmath2 isometry group and spatial @xmath1-topology under the assumption of analyticity . without analyticity , just assuming smoothness , existence of a class of solutions with @xmath3 symmetry ( and again @xmath1-topology ) was shown in @xcite . these _ smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions _ have two functional degrees of freedoms , i.e. , for any choice of two smooth functions ( subject to a periodicity condition ) a corresponding solution exists . like the taub models",
    ", they always have a smooth past and ( with exception of special singular cases ) a smooth future cauchy horizon of @xmath1-topology , through which they can be extended .",
    "properties of these spacetimes have been studied by means of fuchsian methods and soliton methods  however , without explicitly solving einstein s vacuum equations . nevertheless , it is desirable to have exact solutions that can be studied in more detail than possible with abstract considerations alone . in this paper",
    "we derive and study such an exact solution : a three - parametric , spatially inhomogeneous generalization of the taub solution .",
    "this solution is a particular case of the smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions and can be derived with soliton methods .",
    "the application of methods from soliton theory to the equations of general relativity has a long tradition , in particular for axisymmetric and stationary equilibrium configurations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , to mention just a few of many interesting publications ) , but also for plane waves and inhomogeneous cosmologies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are based on the integrability of the einstein equations in the case of symmetric spacetimes and make use of reformulations of the nonlinear field equations in terms of associated linear matrix problems . in particular , it is possible to reduce boundary or initial value problems to linear integral equations . here",
    "we will apply a particular approach due to sibgatullin @xcite in order to construct our exact solution .",
    "a particular motivation for a detailed study of the exact solution described in this paper is the following . since the works of berger and moncrief @xcite on the singularity of gowdy - symmetric solutions of the vacuum equations with spatial @xmath0-topology",
    ", there has been increasing evidence that spiky phenomena are a general feature of singular solutions of einstein s field equations @xcite .",
    "while in the @xmath0-gowdy case , solutions with spikes can be `` manufactured '' @xcite using certain solution generating techniques , the existence and properties of spikes in the case of @xmath1- or @xmath4-gowdy solutions is less well understood , in particular due to the degeneracy of the action of the symmetry group at its axes .",
    "there are only a few discussions of this in the literature , see @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the family of solutions derived here is the first example of a family of exact @xmath1-gowdy solutions where spiky features develop _ on _ the symmetry axes .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : spikes ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gowdy ] we summarize some properties of smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions .",
    "then we construct the exact solution in sec .",
    "[ sec : construction ] .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : prop ] , we study various properties of this cosmological model . in particular , we show that the taub spacetimes are a special case of our solution .",
    "then we look at symmetries of the solution , we show that it is regular in the maximal globally hyperbolic region , and we visualize particular 2-surfaces by embedding them into 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "moreover , we study singularities that are present for special parameter choices , we extend the solution beyond the cauchy horizons , and we identify `` false '' and `` true spikes '' on the symmetry axes .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "without going into the details , let us give a quick summary of geroch s symmetry reduction @xcite with particular emphasis on the resulting wave map structure of the vacuum field equations ; more details which are relevant for our particular case here can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be an oriented and time - oriented globally hyperbolic @xmath6-dimensional lorentzian manifold endowed with a metric @xmath7 of signature @xmath8 , a smooth global time function @xmath9 and a cauchy surface @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the chosen volume form associated with @xmath7 by @xmath11 and the hypersurfaces given by @xmath12 for any constant @xmath13 by @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a smooth globally defined spacelike killing vector field which is tangent to the hypersurfaces @xmath16 .",
    "the flow generated by @xmath15 induces a map @xmath17 from @xmath18 to the space of orbits @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath17 maps every @xmath20 to the uniquely determined integral curve of @xmath15 starting at @xmath21 .",
    "the quotient manifold @xmath19 has a canonical smooth structure and is hence a smooth manifold .",
    "next , we denote the ( square of the ) norm of @xmath15 by @xmath22 the twist @xmath23-form of @xmath15 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the covariant derivative compatible with @xmath26 , and the `` @xmath27-metric '' as @xmath28 it turns out that there is a unique smooth lorentzian metric on @xmath19 which pulls back to @xmath29 along @xmath17 , which we refer to with the same symbol @xmath30 . in the same way",
    "there are a unique function and @xmath23-form on @xmath19 which pull back to the function @xmath31 and the @xmath23-form @xmath32 , respectively , on @xmath18 ; hence we also denote them by the same symbols .",
    "the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 on @xmath19 completely characterize the local geometry of @xmath34 .",
    "geroch found that einstein s vacuum field equations on @xmath34 imply that the @xmath23-form @xmath33 is closed , @xmath35 .",
    "we therefore locally find a twist potential @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .",
    "let us define a new smooth lorentzian metric @xmath38 on @xmath19 as @xmath39 we refer to the associated covariant derivative operator as @xmath40 , ricci tensor as @xmath41 , and raise and lower indices with @xmath38 .",
    "geroch was able to show that the vacuum field equations for @xmath34 ( and certain geometric identities ) are equivalent to the following set of equations on @xmath19 : @xmath42 these equations can be interpreted as @xmath43-dimensional gravity @xmath44 coupled to the wave map @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47-dimensional half - plane model of the hyperbolic space with coordinates @xmath48 and metric @xmath49 the right - hand side of eq .",
    "can be interpreted as the energy - momentum tensor associated with this wave map .",
    "given any smooth curve @xmath50 in @xmath19 and a solution @xmath51 and @xmath38 of the equations above , the quantity @xmath52 is referred to as the _ hyperbolic speed _ and then to refer to it as _ hyperbolic velocity_. in this paper , we refrain from doing this .",
    "] of @xmath53 .",
    "now , we specialize to the case @xmath54 .",
    "we think of @xmath55as the submanifold of @xmath56 determined by @xmath57 .",
    "we are interested in smooth effective actions of the group @xmath3 on @xmath1 . from the smooth effective action of @xmath2 on @xmath58 by rotations around the origin ,",
    "we construct an action of @xmath3 on @xmath56 by demanding that the first factor of @xmath3 generates rotations in the @xmath59-planes around the origin , while the second factor generates rotations in the @xmath60-planes around the origin .",
    "clearly , this action is well - defined also when it is restricted to the subset @xmath1 of @xmath56 .",
    "as summarized in @xcite , all smooth effective actions of @xmath3 are equivalent to this action .",
    "it is useful to introduce coordinates @xmath61 on @xmath1 so that the @xmath62-surfaces ( wherever they are defined ) equal the orbits of the group action .",
    "the _ euler coordinates _",
    "@xmath61 on @xmath1 are @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . clearly , these coordinates break down at the points @xmath66 and @xmath17 , which we refer to as `` poles '' or `` axes '' of @xmath55 in the following .",
    "we also make use of the coordinates @xmath67 ( which we also call euler coordinates ) with @xmath68 as above and @xmath69    let us fix any value @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "then , the @xmath71-periodicity of @xmath72 and @xmath73 implies that , for each choice of @xmath74 , all conditions of the form @xmath75 given by all integers @xmath76 yield the same subset of @xmath1 ; in the same way , for each choice of @xmath77 , all conditions of the form @xmath78 given by all integers @xmath76 yield the same subset of @xmath1 . in this sense , the coordinates @xmath79 and @xmath80 are @xmath71-periodic .",
    "however , each of these subsets is a closed curve which is @xmath81-periodic in @xmath80 in the first case and @xmath81-periodic in @xmath79 in the second case .",
    "the coordinate fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( which can be characterized geometrically without making reference to any coordinates in terms of left- and right - invariant vector fields of the standard action of @xmath84 on @xmath55 ) are smooth non - vanishing vector fields on @xmath55 .",
    "they are linearly independent everywhere except at the axes where they are parallel : @xmath85 at @xmath66 and @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "the integral curves of both fields are closed circles .",
    "the smooth field @xmath88 on the other hand vanishes at @xmath87 , while @xmath89 vanishes at @xmath66 .",
    "both of the two sets of vector fields span the algebra of generators of the @xmath3-action on @xmath1 .",
    "given this action @xmath90 for @xmath91 , we find an action @xmath92 where @xmath93 is equipped with the global smooth time function @xmath9 above and where @xmath21 represents any point in @xmath1 . as a consequence",
    "the generators of this action are globally defined smooth spacelike vector fields .",
    "we assume that we have chosen coordinates @xmath94 so that @xmath95 are euler coordinates on each @xmath16 and so that @xmath82 and @xmath83 generate the @xmath3-action as before .",
    "we shall demand now in addition to the above that @xmath3 acts _ by isometries _ on @xmath34 and hence that @xmath82 and @xmath83 span the algebra of killing vector fields .",
    "let @xmath96 be any other two generators of the algebra of killing vector fields where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are real numbers with @xmath101 .",
    "as long as @xmath102 ( which is assumed in all of what follows ) , it follows that @xmath103 never vanishes ( in particular not at the axes ) .",
    "this allows us to perform the geroch reduction with respect to @xmath103 globally and hence to define the corresponding projection map @xmath17 , quotient manifold @xmath19 , and objects @xmath31 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 as above .",
    "notice that the twist scalar @xmath36 is defined globally because @xmath18 and @xmath19 are simply connected .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath104 ( i.e. , for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 such that @xmath101 ) , the quotient map is the special hopf map in @xcite and @xmath108 .",
    "notice that the @xmath23-parameter subgroup of @xmath3 generated by @xmath103 is not necessarily isomorphic to @xmath2 since its integral curves are not necessarily closed ; indeed , this is the case if and only if @xmath109 .    since @xmath110=0 $ ]",

    "[ sec : construction ] and in some parts of sec .",
    "[ sec : prop ] , this is not a problem .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : spikes ] , it is important to use the smooth manifold structure which is obtained by only _",

    "we summarize the definition and some properties of the class of inhomogeneous cosmological models that we have called _ smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions_. for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "such a spacetime is a gowdy - symmetric , oriented , time - oriented maximally extended globally hyperbolic vacuum solution to einstein s field equations whose spatial topology is that of the three - sphere @xmath1 .",
    "the main property is that it can be extended ( not necessarily as a solution of the vacuum equations ) to a non - globally hyperbolic gowdy - symmetric spacetime in the past .",
    "the corresponding cauchy horizon is supposed to be a smooth null surface with @xmath1-topology and its null generator is parallel to a generator of one of the @xmath2-factors of the symmetry group on the horizon ; in particular , the orbits of the generators are therefore closed . in terms of a time function @xmath113 and",

    "remarkably , this turns out to be possible , and we will illustrate this in the special case @xmath337 , where the relevant formulae become simpler . by way of example , we give some curves with the desired properties in the form @xmath402 or @xmath403 .",

    "we conclude that we can approach the singularity at point @xmath182 either along curves such that @xmath410 , or along curves such that @xmath292 has any prescribed finite limit . in other words ,",

    "this is similar to the behaviour of the kretschmann scalar in the curzon solution @xcite , where it turned out that the singularity contains some `` hidden structure '' , and it is actually possible to extend the solution beyond that singularity .",
    "the original construction of the extended curzon spacetime by scott and szekeres can be found in @xcite , and for a detailed overview we refer to @xcite .",
    "the curzon singularity was classified later on as a so - called _",
    "directional singularity_. roughly speaking , this means that it is possible to approach the singularity either along curves such that the curvature becomes singular ( e.g.  the kretschmann scalar diverges ) or along curves at which everything remains regular .",
    "moreover , it is possible to extend the spacetime through the singularity and to reach further regular regions . for a precise definition and explanation of directional singularities from the point of view of abstract boundary constructions ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and to @xcite .",
    "the directional behaviour described above for our smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solution might lead to the conjecture that the singularity for @xmath362 is also a directional singularity .",
    "however , for this it is not enough that the kretschmann scalar remains finite along some curves .",
    "instead , the entire geometry must remain regular .",
    "in particular , there must be curves approaching the directional singularity along which _ every _ curvature invariant is bounded .",
    "hence , if we could only find one invariant that diverges , even though the kretschmann scalar remains finite , we would not have a directional singularity .",
    "interestingly  or unfortunately , if one likes directional singularities  such a quantity can indeed be provided , namely the invariant @xmath411 which is cubic in the riemann tensor , in contrast to @xmath292 , which is quadratic .",
    "the explicit calculation shows that @xmath412 where @xmath413 is another ( very lengthy ) polynomial in @xmath290 and @xmath291 ( of 24th degree in @xmath290 and 36th degree in @xmath291 ) . in terms of the polar coordinates , @xmath414 becomes @xmath415 with @xmath416 again , the expansion holds uniformly in @xmath373 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath417 correspond to directions in which @xmath414 diverges slower , or , potentially , remains finite  similarly to the above mentioned properties of @xmath292 in relation to the zeros of @xmath378 .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for the existence of a curve along which both @xmath292 _ and _ @xmath414 remain finite is a simultaneous zero of @xmath417 and @xmath378 .",

    "hence , @xmath414 necessarily diverges along all curves on which @xmath292 remains finite and vice versa .",
    "we conclude that , even though the kretschmann scalar exhibits some directional behaviour , the singularity is actually not a directional singularity in the strict sense .",
    "in particular , there can not be any reasonable extension of the spacetime through the singularity .",
    "this provides an interesting example of a solution for which the kretschmann scalar does not contain all information about the singular behaviour , but where , in addition , other invariants have to be studied .      in all of our previous discussion we have considered the situation between the two boundaries @xmath118 and @xmath123 , where , unless in the singular cases , smooth cauchy horizons are located",
    "however , since it is a general property of smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions that they can be extended through the horizons @xcite , it might also be interesting to study some properties of _ extensions _ of our exact solution .    for a given spacetime @xmath34 , another spacetime @xmath420",
    "is called an extension of @xmath34 , if there exists an isometric embedding @xmath421 and if @xmath422 is `` larger '' than @xmath18 in the sense that @xmath423 .",
    "we refer to the article by chruciel and isenberg @xcite for detailed definitions and discussions of spacetime extensions .",
    "in particular , extensions of the taub solutions have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "there are two `` standard '' past extensions and two `` standard '' future extensions of the taub solutions .",
    "chruciel and isenberg have shown that the two standard past extensions are equivalent ( i.e.  related via an isometry ) , and also the two standard future extensions are equivalent . combining the two future and the two past extensions , one obtains four spacetimes that include both types of extensions .",
    "interestingly , these four extensions can be divided into two groups .",
    "both groups contain two equivalent extensions .",
    "however , each extension in the first group is _ not _ equivalent to either extension in the second group .",
    "hence there are _ inequivalent _ extensions of the taub spacetimes . in the following",
    "we will see that our exact solution has similar properties .",
    "the starting point for the construction of extensions of arbitrary smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions in @xcite was the observation that the representation of the metric in terms of our coordinates is singular at @xmath118 and @xmath123 , where @xmath424 holds , see . however , it is possible to introduce new coordinates @xmath425 with respect to which we can extend the solution in a regular way through the cauchy horizons .",
    "an extension is then obtained by extending the domain of @xmath426 and keeping the same form of the metric also for @xmath426-values that correspond to points beyond the cauchy horizons . to this end , appropriate smooth extensions of the metric potentials @xmath18 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 also have to be chosen .",
    "the required isometry @xmath427 is then just given by the identity map @xmath428 .",
    "here we follow the same idea and construct extensions of our solution by first introducing new coordinates . however , instead of the new time coordinate @xmath426 from @xcite , we can also use @xmath121 .",
    "this is particularly useful since all metric potentials are already given as functions of @xmath291 ( and @xmath120 , for which reason we will also use @xmath290 as new coordinate , even though this would not be necessary for guaranteeing regularity at the cauchy horizons ) .",
    "in addition , we perform transformations of the coordinates @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which will be given shortly .",
    "the potentials @xmath18 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are then extended from the domain @xmath429 to @xmath430 by choosing their analytic continuations ( which is possible in our case , since our solution is not only smooth but even analytic ) . in other words",
    ", we use the same formulae , also for @xmath431 . in the following ,",
    "we separately discuss future extensions , past extensions , and combinations of both .",
    "we start by extending the solution through the past cauchy horizon at @xmath118 ( @xmath122 ) . for that purpose ,",
    "we introduce new coordinates @xmath119 via @xmath432 where @xmath433 . in terms of these coordinates ,",
    "the metric becomes @xmath434.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the apparently singular component @xmath435 remains regular at @xmath436 if we choose @xmath437 note that this is only possible because @xmath438 does not depend on @xmath290 , so that @xmath439 is indeed a constant .",
    "however , this is not a coincidence for our particular solution , but holds in general for all smooth gowdy - symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions as a consequence of the einstein equations .",
    "the above coordinate transformation removes the coordinate singularity at the past cauchy horizon .",
    "consequently , we will use the transformed version of the metric also for @xmath440 , i.e.  in the region beyond the past cauchy horizon .",
    "this provides us with the required extension .",
    "note that the two possible sign choices for @xmath439 correspond to two different past extensions . adopting the notation from @xcite",
    ", we denote these as @xmath441 , where ` @xmath442 ' specifies the sign of @xmath439 .    using the explicit solution ,",
    "it is easy to show that the metric coefficients have no singularities in the extended region ( with exception of the usual axes singularities at @xmath443 , which could be removed by another coordinate transformation ) , provided @xmath275 holds .",
    "moreover , the determinant of the metric is now @xmath444 , i.e.  the metric is invertible wherever @xmath275 holds .",
    "therefore , the question of regularity of our extensions reduces to a discussion of zeros of @xmath270 .",
    "we have seen earlier that , in the regular cases with @xmath268 , @xmath270 has no zeros inside the gowdy square",
    ". however , there might be zeros in the extension @xmath445 . and",

    "one _ zero in this region . since we have already seen that the kretschmann scalar diverges at zeros of @xmath270 , cf .",
    ", these zeros do not correspond to mere coordinate singularities , but to physical curvature singularities .",
    "hence we conclude that _ there is always one singularity in each of our two past extensions_. this singularity can be represented as a point in an @xmath290-@xmath291 diagram , but due to the additional degrees of freedom @xmath446 and @xmath447 , it actually has the topology of a 2-torus .",
    "( an exception are singularities on the axes , which appear exclusively in the singular cases @xmath283 .",
    "these have the topology of a circle . )    in a next step , we consider a future extension of our solution .",
    "to this end , we perform a slightly different coordinate transformation , @xmath448 with constants @xmath449 and @xmath450 . similarly to the above discussed past extension , this transformation removes the coordinate singularity at the future cauchy horizon , provided we choose @xmath451 again we have the freedom to choose a sign , which gives rise to two different future extensions .",
    "we denote these as @xmath452 , where ` @xmath442 ' indicates the sign of @xmath450 .",
    "an investigation of the transformed metric shows that its regularity is again equivalent to @xmath275 .",
    "we show in [ app1 ] that @xmath270 has either one or two zeros in the future extension , depending on the value of @xmath208 .",
    "hence , _ there is at least one curvature singularity in each of our two future extensions_.    as mentioned above , in the case of the taub solution ( i.e.  the special case @xmath352 of our solution ) , the two standard future / past extensions are equivalent .",
    "we can easily show that this is also true for our future / past extensions with general @xmath251 .",
    "the extensions @xmath453 and @xmath454 are related via the isometry @xmath455 and therefore equivalent .",
    "similarly , the extensions @xmath456 and @xmath457 are equivalent , which follows from the same isometry .    finally , we look at simultaneous past and future extensions",
    ". these could be constructed by pasting together one of our past extensions with one of the future extensions , which leads to four different spacetimes .",
    "each of these would be described in terms of two coordinate patches , namely one for the past region and one for the future region .",
    "however , it is even possible to obtain past and future extensions for which a single coordinate patch is sufficient . to this end , we start again from our original , not yet extended solution and perform the coordinate transformation @xmath458 which essentially combines the earlier transformations and . with the same choices for the constants @xmath439 , @xmath449 and @xmath450 as before we arrive at an extended spacetime that is regular wherever @xmath275 .",

    "it is easily possible to generalize ( i ) and ( ii ) to our solution .",
    "this follows immediately from the isometry @xmath455 .",
    "the interesting question now is whether ( iii ) also applies in our situation .",
    "the proof of ( iii ) in the taub case made essential use of properties of null geodesics and their extendibility through the cauchy horizons . since the taub solution has four killing vectors , there are enough conservation laws to determine all geodesics up to quadrature , see @xcite . in our case , however , there are `` only '' two killing vectors , which makes the calculation of geodesics more complicated",
    ". hence we do not aim for a rigorous proof of ( iii ) for our solution .",
    "however , the behaviour of those special null geodesics that are restricted to the axes @xmath188 is very similar to the geodesics of the taub solution .",
    "this is discussed in [ app2 ] . and",
    "it might well turn out to be sufficient to study the extendibility of _ axis _ geodesics to prove ( iii ) and @xmath475 necessarily maps an axis geodesic to an axis geodesic .",
    "this could possibly be shown using the following observation .",
    "the boundaries @xmath443 , @xmath476 of the gowdy square can be characterized in terms of the killing vectors @xmath477 , @xmath227 ( where @xmath478 , @xmath479 in our coordinates ) as zeros of @xmath480 .",
    "note that @xmath481 is a scalar and therefore invariant under coordinate transformations .",
    "moreover , also a change of the killing basis leaves the zeros of @xmath481 invariant , since @xmath481 is then only multiplied by a positive factor .",
    "hence the hypothetical isometry would map the coordinate set @xmath443 , @xmath476 of @xmath482 to the same set in @xmath475 .",

    "based on these observations , we conjecture that also ( iii ) generalizes to our solution .",

    "the limit @xmath521 of the hyperbolic speed @xmath505 is constant with value @xmath47 if @xmath492 .",

    "we find that the hyperbolic speed @xmath505 with respect to this choice converges pointwise on @xmath543 to the constant function @xmath47 at @xmath123 ( i.e. , @xmath285 ) .",

    "what can we say about the solution at @xmath123 when we now consider the whole spacetime @xmath18  including the previously removed axis ?",
    "the choice of @xmath103 and @xmath111 above , which is well - defined on @xmath543 , yields a singular geroch reduction at @xmath66 .",
    "nevertheless for our explicit solution , we can compute the limit @xmath546 ( corresponding to @xmath66 ) of the hyperbolic speed @xmath505 at each @xmath547 ( corresponding to @xmath113 ) .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out the function which yields this limit of @xmath505 at every @xmath291 is smooth , and its limit @xmath548 is @xmath6 .",
    "hence , although the hyperbolic speed @xmath505 with respect to this choice of @xmath103 and @xmath111 extends nicely to the future horizon as a constant function with value @xmath47 , it does not extend to a continuous function when the axis is taken into account .",
    "this discontinuity therefore appears precisely where the curvature is unbounded ( sec .",
    "[ sec : singularcases ] ) .",
    "it follows that in the singular cases @xmath362 ( and similarly @xmath356 ) , the discontinuous behaviour at @xmath123 can not be `` undone '' by a reparametrization of the killing orbits and hence , the solution has a true spike at @xmath123 as expected .",
    "the work in @xcite by sthl is the first attempt in the literature to formulate a singular initial value problem for gowdy solutions with spatial @xmath4-topology and @xmath1-topology using fuchsian techniques similar to the results obtained in @xcite for the case of spatial @xmath0-topology .",
    "however , there are unexpected limitations as the results do not yield a family of solutions as large as expected from the @xmath0-gowdy case .",
    "sthl conjectures that these are possibly related to the formation of spikes at the axes of symmetry under general conditions . in order to shed light on this let us study this question for our solution here . to this end , we must first relate the different sets of variables used here to these in @xcite .",
    "sthl chooses @xmath549 and @xmath550 ( i.e. , @xmath551 , @xmath552 in eq .  ) throughout , for which , as described above , the geroch reduction becomes singular at one of the axes .",
    "this , however , is not a problem , since sthl focusses on the vicinity of the _ other _ axis , namely the one at @xmath66 . with respect to this basis of the algebra of killing vectors , sthl s quantity @xmath553 corresponds to our quantity @xmath539",
    ", his quantity @xmath554 corresponds to our @xmath555 and his @xmath556 is the same as our @xmath557 . in order to distinguish these quantities for this choice of killing basis from the ones which we use above",

    "now there is an interesting relation between these sets of variables .",
    "namely , it turns out that the pair @xmath558 satisfies the wave map equations with the hyperbolic target metric @xmath559 and the same source manifold as the pair @xmath510 ; one can check this easily by writing the wave map part of the field equations , namely eqs .   and , in terms of @xmath560 and @xmath539 instead of @xmath561 and @xmath562 .",
    "however , since @xmath563 , the quantity @xmath560 is singular at each time @xmath9 at , at least , one of the axes .",
    "hence @xmath558 is a _ singular _ wave map .",
    "this is different in the case of gowdy solutions with @xmath0-topology where @xmath564 and the main reason why the _ gowdy - to - ernst transformation _ does not work in the vicinity of the symmetry axes in the @xmath1- and @xmath4-gowdy cases ; for more details see @xcite .",

    "the hyperbolic speed is therefore well behaved without signs of false spikes in contrast to our regular wave map parametrization above ; cf .",

    "@xmath356 , the same discontinuity occurs at @xmath87 .",
    "this is a further hint that these discontinuities must be considered as true spikes .",
    "we notice that the limit values @xmath23 and @xmath27 of @xmath567 , which we have found to occur for our solutions , are in consistency with sthl s argument about the behaviour of general solutions at the axes in @xcite .",

    "consequently , the singularities are not directional singularities in the sense used in abstract boundary constructions .",
    "furthermore , we have explicitly constructed several extensions of our solution . in particular , we have argued that it is likely that some of these extensions are not isometric , i.e.  our solution seems to have inequivalent extensions , similar to the taub spacetimes .",

    "we point out that there might be other extensions that are not isometric to the discussed ones . moreover , among these there might be extensions that do not have singularities .",

    "in the following , we consider null geodesics that are restricted to either @xmath66 or @xmath87 .",
    "note that in the case of the spatially homogeneous taub solution , one can find geodesics with @xmath599 for arbitrary values of @xmath68 . here , however , due to the @xmath68-dependence of the metric potentials @xmath18 and @xmath116 , only the special values @xmath345 and @xmath17 lead to geodesics .",
    "we start by looking at the globally hyperbolic region @xmath137 , before we study whether geodesics from that region can also be extended beyond the cauchy horizons .",
