    "_ amplitude death _ occurs when coupled oscillators drive each other to fixed points and stop oscillating @xcite .",
    "initial studies of this phenomenon were on systems wherein the interaction between the subsystems were assumed instantaneous . in the absence of coupling the dynamics in the individual subsystems were on limit cycles of different periods , near hopf bifurcations .",
    "new stable fixed points are created by the coupling , and these become the attractors of the dynamics .",
    "there has been considerable recent interest @xcite on the effects of coupling in a variety of nonlinear systems , not only in the physical sciences , but also in biological and social systems in which in addition to the possibility of chaotic dynamics , complex phenomena such as synchronization , spatiotemporal intermittency , hysteresis have been investigated .",
    "theoretical as well as experimental studies of coupled systems have addressed a number of issues which include phase - shifting , phase locking @xcite as well as amplitude death .",
    "it is often necessary to take account of inherent time delays in the coupling , and reddy @xcite investigated the collective dynamical behavior of limit  cycle oscillators interacting diffusively through time delay at a hopf bifurcation ( see also sec . [ sec : reddy ] ) .",
    "they observed amplitude death of oscillations , regardless of the frequencies of individual oscillators , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in other work , amplitude death phenomenon has been studied theoretically in distributed time - delay @xcite and in a ring of delayed - coupled @xcite oscillators and experimentally in coupled electronic circuit @xcite and coupled thermo - optical oscillators @xcite .",
    "phenomena similar to amplitude death are also observed in time - delayed self - feedback in limit - cycle oscillators @xcite and chaotic oscillators @xcite .    that this phenomenon can occur for",
    "coupled _ chaotic _ oscillators as well is the main result of the present work . by introducing time ",
    "delay in the coupling of chaotic subsystems , irrespective of their type , one can achieve amplitude death .",
    "this transition can be direct , namely from chaotic motion to fixed points , or indirect , when first a pair of limit cycles ( rather than a pair of fixed points ) are stabilized through the coupling .",
    "the motion then asymptotically becomes periodic , and the subsystems oscillate at a common frequency . as a function of the time  delay , however , this limit cycle motion can go from being in  phase to being out  of  phase .",
    "this transition is signaled by a dramatic change in two indicators : the phase difference between oscillators , and their common frequency .",
    "further variation of the time - delay eventually leads to amplitude death via stabilization of new fixed points .    in the following section",
    "we show that identical coupled chaotic systems with matching or mismatched parameters , and indeed even completely different chaotic systems , all show amplitude death .",
    "the in  phase to out  of  phase transition in coupled limit cycle oscillators can be treated analytically .",
    "we estimate the common frequency for a particular case in section iii , and although similar analysis can not be carried out for chaotic oscillators , this provides some insight into how the phenomenon arises more generally .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion and summary in section iv .",
    "the basic phenomenology of amplitude death in limit ",
    "cycle systems has been described in some detail @xcite .",
    "we consider the general case of chaotic coupled systems , @xmath0 where * x * and * y * denote the variables of the two subsystems .",
    "the dynamical equations are specified by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 specify the couplings , @xmath5 being the time  delay .",
    "several scenarios are possible . in the simplest case , the subsystems specified by the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be identical .",
    "this is dealt with in subsection a below . by altering the parameters ,",
    "the two subsystems can be made nonidentical , and this case is treated in subsection b. finally , the two chaotic systems can be completely different , and this case is presented in subsection c. in all cases we demonstrate that amplitude death is possible , though the mechanism in each case is somewhat different . for simplicity ,",
    "the results are presented through applications to specific rssler or lorenz dynamical systems which have been extensively studied in the context of chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the present results are mainly numerical since analytic results for such nonlinear systems are difficult to obtain .    in each of the cases ,",
    "we address the possibility of amplitude suppression , namely the stabilization of limit cycles .",

    "both types of periodic motions ( either in or out of phase ) can arise from the following reasons @xcite .",
    "either the coupling stabilizes one of the ( infinitely many ) unstable periodic orbits ( upo ) @xcite which are embedded in the chaotic set , or creates new periodic solutions with time period ( @xmath24 ) different from the time delay , @xmath25 ( the perturbation term does not vanish here ) . in the former case only those upos will be stabilized whose time periods are equal to the time delay , namely @xmath26 .",
    "a trajectory will settle on an upo and remain there since the feedback function becomes zero : the coupling term vanishes when @xmath27 becomes equal to @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the perturbation does not change the original solution . in the latter situation ,",

    "[ fig : ident](b ) ( red line with circles ) . since this is negative in the fp region ( where @xmath33 ) , the fixed point is stable .",
    "any attempt by the subsystems to move from this state increases the coupling term and brings the entire system back to the fixed point .",

    ", the mechanism is the same as that of the coupled limit cycle case @xcite ( see also sec . [",

    "simultaneously the stability of the fixed point is lost as a pair of eigenvalues cross the axis from left to right .",

    "amplitude death in chaotic systems is a consequence of time  delays that stabilize fixed points that might either have existed in the uncoupled system , or that might have been created through the interaction .",

    "this stabilization is initiated via riddling phenomenon .",
    "we have used the as indicator to detect the different dynamical regimes , and to detect transitions , as for example , in the case of identical oscillators , when the subsystems are oscillating in or out of phase with each other .",
    "when the subsystems are maximally stable , namely the largest is minimum , a `` phase '' transition occurs , and motion goes from being in phase to being out of phase .",
    "measures that detect this transition are the phase difference and frequency ; although not possible to analyze in chaotic systems , it is possible to get some understanding of this transition for a limit  cycle case .",
    "apart from its mathematical interest , the possibility of using a transition from dynamics on a limit cycle which is in phase to that which is out of phase in practical applications suggest itself . in experimental application of amplitude death phenomena ,",
    "where transient dynamics always persists , it will be important to know the parameters where motion is either in - phase ( low frequency ) or out of phase ( high frequency ) .",
    "an important possible use of it could be a coupled chaotic lasers @xcite , where relatively higher degree of constant output could be obtained by keeping the parameters of the lasers and the time - delay coupling in the out of phase regime compared to that of the in - phase @xcite .",
    "experimental verification of this generalization of the conventional amplitude - death phenomenon that occurs in limit - cycle oscillators may in fact , prove to be technically simple to achieve since it persists even after parameters mismatch , and occurs for different types of coupled oscillators , bypassing the need for irregular oscillations ( ref .",
