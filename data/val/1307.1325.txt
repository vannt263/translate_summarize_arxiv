    "entanglement quantifies quantum correlations between various parts of the system , and it has been recognized as a resource for quantum computational tasks@xcite .",
    "quantum correlations act as markers for both thermal and quantum phase transitions , being able to indicate a critical point ( cp ) through singularities . in recent years",
    "the study of quantum correlations and entanglement in spin 1/2 spin systems has gained importance due to their potential application in building quantum computers .    for many - qubit spin systems , it is interesting to study phase transitions from the perspective of how quantum entanglement and information are shared between different pairs of spins .",
    "in particular there are many well - studied spin models , for which the entanglement and information distribution can be studied easily , as these systems have known diagonal and off - diagonal correlation functions exhibiting critical behavior near a phase transition point@xcite .",
    "various measures of entanglement have been used to study phase transitions in spin systems @xcite .",
    "the spin - spin correlations become long - ranged in the vicinity of a quantum or classical critical point . however",

    "the quantum discord , has been explored by oliver and zurek@xcite , and vedral@xcite , which incorporates how measurements on subsystems affect the quantum correlations shared between two subsystems .",
    "they argued that the quantum discord quantifies the minimum amount of quantum correlations for mixed states , thus the discord characterizes the quantumness of the system .",
    "it is shown that a nonzero discord can provide quantum advantage over classical systems even when the system has zero concurrence measure @xcite the quantum discord has been explored in the recent years@xcite in the context of quantum phase transitions . in this paper",
    "we study the behavior of quantum correlations and quantum discord near a critical point in general , and then explicitly study pairwise quantum correlations in heisenberg spin chain .",
    "we will show that the quantum discord has a long range behavior if the two - point diagonal correlation function is long ranged , for isotropic and translationally - invariant systems .",
    "thus , the quantum discord can track the critical behavior of systems , near either a classical thermal critical point or a quantum critical point , in an analogy with the spin correlation functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first derive an analytic formula , in the next section , for the quantum discord for a class of two - qubit mixed states .",
    "this is an improvement to the previous formulas @xcite that this method completely characterizes the optimal measurement basis . in the third section we study the discord in spin systems with different symmetries . for isotropic states ,",
    "we show that the discord between any pair of spins is completely determined by their diagonal correlation functions .",
    "we show that the discord exhibits a kink at the kosterliz - thouless transition for the anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "we investigate the behavior of the discord with the distance between spins . in the fourth section",
    "we investigate the distribution of conditional entropies as the measurement basis is varied for the subsystem . instead of just picking the minimum value of the conditional entropy , as is done while computing the quantum discord ,",
    "a distribution of conditional entropies is associated with a given two - qubit mixed state .",
    "we study the average conditional entropy and the mean - square fluctuations of this distribution for the ground state of the anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "we will first consider two - qubit mixed states , and study the information - theoretic measure of discord between two spins .",
    "this measure will be used later , in the next section , to study the quantum correlations between a given pair of qubits in a particular many - qubit state , for example the ground state of a spin chain with anisotropic heisenberg interactions between neighboring spins . in this section ,",

    "<S> the quantum discord , which quantifies the amount of quantum correlations present between parts of a system , is investigated for antiferromagnetic spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> the discord for a pair of spins in the many - spin ground state is related to the diagonal and off - diagonal spin - spin correlation functions and the local magnetization . for isotropic and translationally invariant states , </S>",
    "<S> the discord is shown to be a function of the diagonal correlation function only . </S>",
    "<S> thus , near a thermal / quantum critical point , the discord for a pair of spins shows long - range behavior , analogously of the correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the discord exhibits a kink singularity as a function of the anisotropy parameter for the the ground state of the heisenberg model , for both nearest - neighbor spins as well as for well - separated spins . the preferred measurement basis for the minimum conditional entropy , which determines the discord , changes discontinuously across the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional entropy distribution over all possible the measurement basis is investigated . for the isotropic model , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is just a @xmath0-function , whereas it has a twin - peak structure for anisotropic model . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the average value and the mean - square fluctuation of the conditional entropy also show a signature of the critical - point behavior . </S>"
