    "at first glance , yang - mills ( ym ) theory and gravity seem to have little in common .",
    "this is especially true from the point of view of calculating perturbative scattering amplitudes : then the einstein - hilbert lagrangian contains an infinite number of vertices , but the yang - mills lagrangian contains only three and four - point vertices . while it is often said that both theories are gauge theories , the enormous differences between the theories from the point of view of computation makes this point of comparison seem rather poetic .",
    "but a deeper study reveals concrete relationships between gauge and gravity scattering amplitudes .",
    "early in the first heyday of string theory , kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt ) derived a relation , valid in any number of dimensions , expressing any closed string tree amplitude in terms of a sum of products of two open string tree amplitudes  @xcite . taking the field theory limit of the string amplitudes ,",
    "these klt relations imply in particular that any graviton scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of a sum of products of colour - ordered gluon scattering amplitudes .",
    "the klt relations are very simple for low point amplitudes ; for example , the three - point graviton scattering amplitude is simply the square of the three - point yang - mills amplitude . for higher - point amplitudes , however , the sum in the klt relations becomes complicated , presenting an algorithmic obstacle to computing graviton amplitudes via klt relations .",
    "a more insightful  squaring \" relationship between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes was conjectured recently by bern , carrasco and johansson ( bcj )  @xcite .",
    "this relationship implies a set of identities satisfied by gauge theory amplitudes , which were proven in @xcite .",
    "bcj conjectured that scattering amplitudes in gravity can be obtained from yang - mills scattering amplitudes , expressed in a suitable form , by a remarkably simple squaring procedure . in brief , the bcj procedure involves expressing yang - mills amplitudes in terms of feynman - like diagrams which only have cubic vertices . associated with each cubic diagram is a colour factor and also a kinematic numerator .",
    "bcj observed two remarkable things about these kinematic numerators .",
    "first , when a set of three colour factors satisfies a jacobi identity , then the kinematic numerators can be chosen so that they also satisfy the same jacobi identity .",
    "second , the graviton scattering amplitude is obtained from the yang - mills amplitude by simply replacing the colour factors by the kinematic numerators ; this  squaring \" relationship has been proven in @xcite assuming that appropriate gauge theory numerators exist .",
    "explicit numerators have been described in @xcite . moreover , the relations are conjectured to hold off - shell  @xcite .",
    "the bcj relations have been discussed extensively in recent work , see  @xcite for example .",
    "the left - right factorization of the gravitational feynman rules to all orders in perturbation theory has been recently demonstrated by hohm @xcite .",
    "it is especially intriguing that the kinematic numerators appearing in the bcj relations satisfy jacobi identities .",
    "indeed , at four - point level this relation was found in the early 1980s  @xcite .",
    "the fact that these jacobi identities are satisfied at all points strongly suggests that there is a genuine infinite dimensional lie algebra at work in the theory .",
    "moreover , since the gravitational amplitudes are formed by replacing yang - mills colour factors with these kinematic numerators , this group seems to entirely determine the gravitational scattering amplitudes .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the kinematic numerators which bcj discuss are gauge dependent , so that the presence of this kinematic algebra seems to be manifest only in a class of gauges . in these gauges ,",
    "the relationship between yang - mills theory and gravity is especially simple .    in order to study this kinematic algebra in its simplest habitat",
    ", we consider the self - dual sectors of yang - mills theory and of gravity .",
    "the scattering amplitudes in these sectors vanish at tree level ( with the exception of the three - point amplitude ) . however , a scattering amplitude is a rather perverse object to study in a classical field theory .",
    "it is more natural to study solutions of the field equations ; indeed , tree - level scattering amplitudes can easily be obtained by taking a limit of a series expansion of an appropriate classical solution .",
    "we find that the kinematic algebra is manifest by a simple comparison of the equations governing self - dual yang - mills and gravity .",
    "the algebra is associated with area - preserving diffeomorphisms in a certain two - dimensional space .",
    "our understanding of this algebra makes it completely trivial to see that the bcj relations extend to the classical solutions of yang - mills theory and gravity which describe scattering of an arbitrary number of positive helicity particles , and measuring the resulting field at a point .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the hidden symmetries of self - dual gauge theory and gravity ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we further study the consequences of these results for the full yang - mills and gravitational theories .",
    "it is useful to consider these theories in the light - cone gauge , where they can be formulated in terms of positive and negative helicity particles . using a procedure inspired by chalmers and siegel @xcite , we are able to relate the mhv amplitudes to the self - dual sector , and to show that the corresponding bcj relations are a result of the self - dual kinematic algebra .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : bfreview ] we open with a review of some background material . with this review in hand",
    ", we turn in sections  [ sec : sdym ] and  [ sec : sdgr ] to a discussion of the self - dual yang - mills and gravity theories , respectively . in these sections ,",
    "we discuss the details of the kinematic algebra and bcj relations for classical backgrounds . we discuss the implications of this algebra for the bcj structure of mhv amplitudes of the full yang - mills theory in section  [ sec : full ] , and of gravity in section  [ sec : gravity ] .",
    "we close with some final remarks in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "since this article deals with classical background fields applied to topics of interest in the recent literature on scattering amplitudes , it may be helpful to provide some review of our methods .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the bcj relations , then provide an overview of the relationship between classical field solutions and tree amplitudes , and finally discuss the spinor - helicity method and a slight extension of this method which has been helpful in previous work on self - dual yang - mills theory and gravity .",
    "let us set the scene with a description of the bcj relations  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to express the @xmath0-point yang - mills amplitudes as a sum over the cubic diagrams , @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the colour factors , the denominators @xmath3 are products of the feynman propagator denominators appearing in the cubic graphs , and @xmath4 are kinematic numerators .",
    "the cubic diagrams can be thought of as diagrams showing how the yang - mills structure constants are sewn together to make the various appropriate colour factors for the scattering amplitudes ; at four points there are three diagrams ( for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels ) , at five points there are 15 diagrams and so on .",
    "contact terms which appear in the feynman diagram expansion of the amplitudes are assigned to appropriate cubic diagrams based on their colour structure ; missing propagators in these contact terms are simply reintroduced by multiplying and dividing the contact term by such propagators .",
    "given this decomposition , bcj asserted that one can always choose numerators @xmath4 such that whenever the colour factors @xmath7 , and @xmath8 of three diagrams @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related by a jacobi identity , then so are their kinematic numerators : @xmath11 where the appropriate signs depend on the definitions of the colour factors .",
    "furthermore , the kinematic numerators can be chosen so that they enjoy the same antisymmetry properties as the colour factors under exchanging particle labels : @xmath12 taken together , these requirements indicate that the kinematic numerators @xmath4 have the same algebraic properties as the colour factors @xmath2 .",
    "given an expression for the yang - mills scattering amplitude in terms of numerators which satisfy the kinematic jacobi identity , bcj further noticed that the gravitational scattering amplitude is simply given by replacing the yang - mills colour factors by another copy of the kinematic numerator , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational coupling .",
    "it is worth remarking on the nature of the choices one has to make in defining appropriate numerators .",
    "indeed , these numerators are not unique .",
    "for example , at four points the yang - mills scattering amplitude is written as @xmath15 since @xmath16 , the amplitude can also be written in terms of new numerators @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an entirely arbitrary function of the momenta and polarizations .",
    "similar redefinitions are possible at higher points .",
    "bcj described these redefinitions as generalized gauge transformations , since ordinary gauge transformations are a familiar way of moving terms between various feynman diagrams .",
    "in the on - shell four - point case , the numerator redefinitions are such that the kinematic jacobi identity , @xmath19 , is maintained . however , as bcj discuss , this is not true at higher points , even on shell .",
    "thus , one must choose an appropriate gauge to find numerators which satisfy the kinematic jacobi identity .",
    "we know turn to reminding the reader of the connection between tree - level feynman diagrams and classical field solutions @xcite . in a few words ,",
    "tree feynman diagrams arise as the diagrammatic representation of terms in a perturbative series for the classical solution in the presence of a source , @xmath20 .",
    "this can be understood from the functional approach in quantum field theory .",
    "consider the generating functional @xmath21 = \\int d \\phi \\ ; e^{i ( s[\\phi ] + j \\phi ) } = e^{i w[j ] } , \\ ] ] where the fields are symbolically represented by @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 $ ] is the generating functional for connected correlation functions .",
    "amplitudes are computed from the connected correlators by the lsz procedure .",
    "since our focus in this work is on tree level , we take the limit @xmath24 . in this limit",
    ", the path integral is dominated by solutions @xmath25 $ ] of the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 = s[\\phi_{\\mathrm{cl}}[j ] ] + j \\phi_{\\mathrm{cl}}[j ] .\\ ] ] the @xmath27-point connected correlators are obtained by the @xmath27th functional differentiation of @xmath23 $ ] with respect to @xmath20 . however , by the equations of motion , @xmath28}{\\delta j } + \\phi_{\\mathrm{cl}}[j ] =   \\phi_{\\mathrm{cl}}[j ] .\\ ] ] thus , the @xmath27-point connected correlators are generated by @xmath29 differentiations of the background field created by the source .",
    "much of the recent progress in our understanding of scattering amplitudes for massless particles has relied on the fact that the external legs of the amplitudes are on - shell , that is , their momenta @xmath30 satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "there is a limit of these generating functionals for which all but one of the legs are on - shell .",
    "this technique has been used , for example , in the classic paper of berends and giele on recursion relations in gauge theory  @xcite , as well as in a beautiful paper of brown  @xcite to sum tree graphs contributing to threshold particle production .",
    "let us now illustrate how this technique works in the simple setting of scalar field theory .",
    "we will consider a massless cubic scalar field theory , with lagrangian ( including the source ) @xmath32 the classical equation of motion is simply @xmath33 it is convenient to fourier transform to momentum space ; then the classical equation is written as @xmath34 where we have introduced a short - hand notation @xmath35 we will solve this equation order - by - order in perturbation theory .",
    "thus , we write @xmath36 where @xmath37 is of order @xmath38 . at zeroth order",
    ", we must simply solve the free equation , so we learn that @xmath39 at next to leading order , counting powers of @xmath40 , we find that @xmath41 satisfies the equation @xmath42 so that @xmath43 diagrammatically , this equation is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : scalar3 ] .",
    "one can construct the three - point scattering amplitude from this expression by functionally differentiating twice with respect to the source @xmath20 , and amputating the three lines .",
    "that is , @xmath44     consists of a single interaction between two particles sourced by @xmath20.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( 0,0)@xmath20 ( -45,15)@xmath41 ( 0,30)@xmath20    it is useful to note that the operation of differentiating with respect to sources and multiplying by @xmath45 is equivalent to differentiating with respect to the solution @xmath46 of the zeroth order equation .",
    "indeed , one can then consider the limit @xmath47 in this limit , the equation of motion becomes @xmath48 subject to the boundary condition that as @xmath49 , the complete solution @xmath22 tends to a non - trivial solution @xmath50 of the free equation ( note that @xmath50 has support on @xmath51 ) .",
    "working in this limit has the advantage that the background field is built from the objects @xmath50 which have the interpretation of on - shell particles .",
    "the amplitude is given by @xmath52 note , however , that if we think of @xmath22 not as a background field , but simply as a generating functional for tree amplitudes , then we do not need to take the limit .",
    "the difference is that , in the latter case , we can take all legs to be off - shell , while if @xmath22 is a legitimate solution of the source - free field equation , then all but one legs ( i.e. all legs representing sources ) must be on - shell .",
    "let us continue to one more order in perturbation theory .",
    "the next correction @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 inserting our expressions for @xmath46 and @xmath41 , we find @xmath55 the feynman diagram corresponding to this expression is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar4 ] .",

    "thus we may write @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two component spinors .",
    "notice that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not uniquely defined ; indeed , new spinors @xmath73 and @xmath74 are just as good",
    ". we will exploit this freedom below .",
    "the only lorentz invariant associated with a single momentum @xmath75 is @xmath76 .",
    "however , given two momenta @xmath75 and @xmath77 , there are non - trivial invariants .",
    "we may form invariants from the spinors @xmath78 and @xmath79 associated with the two momenta .",
    "lorentz transformations act on these spinors via a single copy of su(2 ) ; therefore the object @xmath80 is a lorentz invariant .",
    "similarly , the object @xmath81 \\equiv \\epsilon^{\\dot \\alpha \\dot \\beta } \\tilde \\lambda_{1 \\dot \\alpha}\\tilde \\lambda_{2 \\dot \\beta}$ ] is an invariant .",
    "all other lorentz invariants are built from these .",
    "in particular @xmath82 $ ]",
    ".    it will be convenient for us to define analogues of the spinorial products for off - shell momenta .",
    "in doing so , we follow the notation of @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath71 is now dimensionless ; correspondingly , @xmath72 has ( mass ) dimension 1 .",
    "we then compute that @xmath84 where @xmath85 the spinor products are then given by @xmath86 & \\rightarrow x(p_1 , p_2 ) \\equiv p_{1 w } p_{2 u } - p_{1 u } p_{2 w } , \\\\",

    "the benefit is that the definition of @xmath89 extends to arbitrary off - shell momenta .",
    "we shall have more to say about the freedom to rescale spinors in the later sections of this paper .",
    "in this section , we begin our study of classical background fields . since our goal is to investigate any possible bcj - like structure of the fields , we choose to study the simplest non - trivial fields available .",
    "these are the self - dual solutions .",
    "firstly , we consider the self - dual yang - mills ( sdym ) equations in minkowski spacetime , @xmath90 the gauge field is necessarily complexified , and the physical interpretation is that it is a configuration of positive helicity waves .",
    "our set - up follows bardeen and cangemi @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "we work with the coordinates , such that the metric is given by @xmath91 we choose the light - cone gauge , where @xmath92 .",

    "thus , our problem reduces to studying a scalar equation with a cubic coupling .    following the discussion in the last section ,",
    "let us now solve the scalar equation with the boundary condition that , when @xmath49 , @xmath98 . in momentum space , we can write this equation as @xmath99 where we have defined @xmath100 we shall use an integral einstein convention for the contraction of the indices of @xmath101 , @xmath102 moreover , we can lower and raise indices using @xmath103 it is straightforward to see that @xmath104 is totally antisymmetric , e.g. @xmath105 our notation is designed to emphasize the fact that the coefficients @xmath106 have the same algebraic properties as the structure constants @xmath107 .",
    "however , we will learn below that the significance is deeper , and that @xmath106 are , in fact , structure constants for a certain infinite - dimensional lie algebra .",
    "equipped with this formalism , we solve the equation of motion for @xmath108 iteratively , as a series expansion in the coupling constant @xmath40 .",

    "the obvious question now is : what is the algebra whose structure constants are the @xmath106 factors ?",
    "the answer appears naturally once we look at the gravity case .    for completeness ,",
    "let us remark that there is a simple expression valid to all orders @xcite , @xmath115 however , this form is not convenient for our purposes , since the feynman diagram expansion is not explicit .",
    "moreover , unlike the preceding discussion , this expression is only valid if @xmath50 has support on @xmath116 , i.e. if the legs representing sources correspond to on - shell particles .",
    "we consider now self - dual gravity ( sdg ) with lorentzian signature , using an approach analogous to the one we used for sdym .",
    "previously , mason and skinner  @xcite have computed the mhv amplitudes in gravity by perturbing the classical , self - dual background field , in work analogous to that of bardeen and cangemi @xcite on self - dual yang - mills theory . our focus here will be on the background field itself rather than perturbations around it .",
    "the self - dual equations are @xmath117 inspired by the gauge field , we try as a solution the metric @xmath118 where @xmath14 is the gravitational coupling , @xmath119 is the minkowski metric , and the non - vanishing components of @xmath120 are @xmath121 the sdg equations then imply that the scalar field @xmath22 obeys . ]",

    "we introduced here the poisson bracket @xmath125 from which we construct the poisson algebra @xmath126 this is the kinematic algebra that we were looking for in the last section .",

    "however , the relationship is not given by @xmath139 because this would involve squaring a delta function .",
    "one algorithm for deducing the gravitational expressions from the yang - mills formulae involves extracting the overall momentum conserving delta function , and then following the bcj procedure of identifying a kinematic numerator which is to be squared .",
    "let us illustrate this at the level of the second corrections , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",

    "in fact , this three - point amplitude is the same as the amplitude in the full theory .",
    "let us briefly explain why this is so . in yang - mills theory ,",

    ". then this yang - mills amplitude is given by the same expression as in the self - dual sector .",
    "it is important to note that , while we started from a spinor - helicity on - shell expression , the final result can be obtained off - shell .",
    "similar comments hold for the @xmath155 yang - mills amplitude ; a basis of polarization vectors can be found so that the ym amplitude is given by the three - point amplitude in the anti - self - dual sector .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath156 then the anti - self - dual three - point amplitude ( and the @xmath155 ym amplitude ) is simply @xmath157 where @xmath158 are the structure constants for the anti - self - dual kinematic algebra .",
    "note that , if @xmath75 and @xmath77 are on - shell , then the quantities @xmath159 and @xmath160 are related by @xmath161    in the gravitational case , it is also true that a polarization basis can be chosen so that the three - point functions in the full theory are identical to the three - point functions we have discussed in the self - dual sector .",
    "we have seen that the kinematic algebra is present in the full theory , at least at the level of the three - point amplitudes .",
    "however , it seems that two algebras appear : one for the mhv three - point amplitude , and another for the @xmath162 case . to study how these algebras interact , it is convenient to turn to the chalmers - siegel formulation of yang - mills theory in light - cone gauge  @xcite .",
    "their action describes yang - mills theory as a theory of interacting positive and negative helicity degrees of freedom , and therefore is very helpful to connect the full theory with the discussion of section  [ sec : sdym ] .",

    "there are several feynman diagrams contributing to this amplitude , including the four - point vertex diagrams .",
    "we choose a gauge by taking @xmath179 to be a reference leg in the sense of chalmers and siegel @xcite .",
    "thus we take the limit @xmath180 , is on - shell . ] so that the four - point vertex is eliminated .",
    "@xmath181 where we introduced the mandelstam variables , @xmath182 there is no divergence in the amplitude as @xmath180 since it is cancelled by @xmath183 .",
    "the form of the amplitude indicates that the bcj kinematic numerators are @xmath184 where @xmath18 is a proportionality factor .",

    "@xcite details the procedure by which the amplitude can be put in the standard spinor - helicity form , so we will not address this .      in our study of the four - point yang - mills amplitude , we found it helpful to make the reference leg choice @xmath193 .",
    "any reference leg must be attached to a three - point vertex of the same self - duality ; that is , a negative helicity reference leg must be attached to a @xmath194 vertex . in the case of the four - point function",
    ", this choice of reference leads to the off - shell amplitude being written in terms of products of a single @xmath194 vertex and a single @xmath147 vertex .",
    "moreover , with this choice both vertices are proportional to the structure constants of the self - dual kinematic algebra .",
    "we shall again exploit this simplification to clarify the relationship between the jacobi identities satisfied by the mhv amplitudes and our kinematic algebra .",
    "we will show that all the feynman diagrams contributing to an mhv @xmath27-point amplitude , containing @xmath195 particles of positive helicity and 2 particles of negative helicity , contain only three - point vertices . by choosing a negative helicity line to be the reference leg ,",
    "we ensure that the vertex attached to that leg is a @xmath155 vertex , while all the other vertices are @xmath147 vertices .",
    "to see this , let @xmath196 be the number of @xmath147 three - point vertices in a given feynman diagram , while @xmath197 is the number of @xmath155 vertices .",
    "similarly , let @xmath198 be the number of four - point vertices .",
    "we suppose there are @xmath199 internal lines at @xmath27 points .",
    "it is straightforward to establish a number of identities relating these quantities . counting the powers of the coupling @xmath40 , we find that @xmath200 meanwhile , the positive helicity ends of internal or external lines must terminate in the vertices , and similarly for the negative helicity lines : @xmath201 manipulation of these identities leads to the conclusion that there is a strong constraint on the sum of the number of @xmath155 vertices and four - point vertices : @xmath202 since we choose one negative helicity line as a reference , it follows that @xmath203 and so @xmath204 .",

    "the negative helicity line represented in bold is the reference leg , which is connected to the only @xmath155 vertex .",
    "the contribution from this diagram is proportional to @xmath211    just as in the four - point case , the choice of reference line attached to the single @xmath155 vertex in the amplitude means that the quantity @xmath212 appearing in the vertex is proportional to @xmath89 . expressed in this way , the jacobi relations satisfied by the numerators are nothing but the jacobi relations of the self - dual kinematic algebra .",
    "in this section , we will see how the kinematic algebra arises for gravity , and confirm that it indeed corresponds to the bcj `` square '' of the yang - mills case .",
    "we need a formulation of the theory in terms of positive and negative helicity particles , analogous to the chalmers - siegel action , in order to make a connection with section  [ sec : sdgr ] .",
    "fortunately , such a lagrangian was obtained by ananth _",

    "\\label{lagg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the self - dual equation is easily recovered from the general equations of motion by setting @xmath225 , @xmath226 .    in momentum space ,",
    "the equations of motion take the form @xmath227 we already see the squaring of the kinematic factors in the cubic vertices , when comparing with the analogous expression in yang - mills theory , equation . more explicitly , we can determine the tree - level @xmath175 ( off - shell ) amplitude .",
    "we saw in the yang - mills case that the reference leg choice @xmath228 was very useful .",
    "the same procedure leads now to @xmath229 the @xmath185 vertex associated with the reference leg is proportional to @xmath89 , as we saw before .",
    "the amplitude is finite , due to the contribution from the polarization vectors , which are taken to be the squares of the yang - mills polarization vectors , @xmath230 notice that it is crucial that the four - point vertex vanishes in the limit @xmath228 .",
    "this can be seen directly from the lagrangian : @xmath231 never acts on a single particle ( @xmath221 or @xmath222 ) in the @xmath232 contribution .",
    "it is no surprise that the bcj squaring holds for this mhv amplitude .",
    "in fact , under a certain assumption , we can show that it holds for any mhv amplitude .",
    "the argument is the same as the one used in section  [ subsec : higherpoint ] to show that the four - point vertex is irrelevant for mhv amplitudes , if we use the reference leg gauge .",
    "again , we consider an @xmath27-point mhv amplitude @xmath233 , and denote the number of internal lines by @xmath199 , the number of @xmath147 vertices by @xmath196 , and the number of @xmath194 vertices by @xmath197 .",
    "the additional vertices are labeled by the number of incoming positive helicity lines @xmath234 and the number of incoming negative helicity lines @xmath235 ; the number of such vertices is denoted by @xmath236 .",
    "these additional vertices all satisfy @xmath237 , which can be explicitly checked by extending the lagrangian above to higher orders in @xmath14 .",
    "then , the expressions analogous to ( [ ngym]-[nmym ] ) are @xmath238 from which we conclude that @xmath239 we assume that , as in yang - mills theory , the reference leg must be attached to a cubic vertex .",
    "we choose a negative helicity particle as our reference leg , so that @xmath240 .",
    "it follows that the mhv amplitudes can be computed only from cubic vertices . for our assumption to be true",
    ", it is required that no higher - order term in the lagrangian contains @xmath231 acting on a single particle .",
    "@xcite presents the @xmath241 contribution to the lagrangian , and this is indeed the case .",
    "we conjecture that this is valid to all orders .",
    "in the early sections of the paper , we described how a study of the self - dual sectors of yang - mills theory and of gravity sheds light on the bcj relations .",
    "cubic feynman diagrams appear quite naturally in the self - dual sectors , and it is easy to see that the numerators of these diagrams have the properties which bcj described .",
    "this occurs for a very simple reason : the numerators are built out of structure constants of an infinite dimensional lie algebra . in the case of gravity , the presence of an infinite dimensional algebra seems entirely reasonable , and it is pleasing to see such an algebra play the role in gravity that the finite dimensional colour algebra plays in yang - mills theory .",
    "indeed , mason and newman  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) previously proposed a very similar relationship between gauge theory and gravity .",
    "but it is quite remarkable that the klt relations somehow work in reverse , so that this algebra is also present in the yang - mills theory .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is that the yang - mills cubic vertices are dressed by the straight product of the structure constants of the colour algebra and the kinematic algebra .    to make the kinematic algebra manifest in the case of mhv amplitudes of yang - mills theory",
    ", it was useful for us to work in the chalmers - siegel formulation of the theory . by choosing a special gauge",
    ", we removed the four - point vertex , so that the mhv amplitudes are computed off - shell by cubic diagrams .",
    "this is reminiscent of the bcfw computation of the mhv amplitudes .",
    "the close connection between bcfw and the chalmers - siegel action has already been pointed out by vaman and yao  @xcite .",
    "it seems that to clarify the structure of the kinematic algebra beyond mhv amplitudes will require understanding how to formulate these amplitudes in terms of cubic diagrams .",
    "such a formulation must be related to the pure - spinor calculation of the bcj numerators described by mafra , schlotterer and stieberger @xcite .",
    "similarly , it would be interesting to see the supersymmetric version of this algebra .",
    "the work of broedel and kallosh @xcite on the light - cone formulation of @xmath242 sym and @xmath243 supergravity would be a good starting point .    on the gravitational side ,",
    "we have seen how to compute mhv amplitudes from cubic diagrams in light - cone gauge , up to a mild assumption about the behaviour of the higher terms in the gravitational light - cone lagrangian .",
    "the fact that the bcj relations hold ( at least on - shell ) for all graviton amplitudes suggests that there is some cubic theory which can be used to compute these amplitudes .",
    "finding this theory would be a great step forward in our understanding of both gauge theory and gravity .",
