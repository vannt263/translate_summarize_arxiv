    "the successful application of effective field theories ( eft s ) to two - body scattering has revived interest in developing model - independent treatments of few - body systems , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case of two - body systems eft s",
    "provide a framework within which the old idea of the effective - range expansion @xcite can be extended systematically to describe electromagnetic or weak couplings .",
    "their application to three - body systems requires the addition of three - body forces .",
    "the observation that such forces are essential for describing low - energy three - body observables goes back to the work of phillips @xcite .",
    "one model - independent way of introducing them is the boundary - condition method developed by brayshaw @xcite .",
    "the eft approach provides a more practical way of doing so , and one which can be extended to include couplings to external currents .    in the case of two - body scattering , these eft",
    "s have been well explored . if there is a clear separation between the low - energy scales of interest and the high - energy scales characterising the underlying physics , then the interactions terms in the effective lagrangian can be organised systematically as an expansion in powers of ratios of low - energy to high - energy scales . for weakly interacting systems",
    "the power counting in this expansion is just that of naive dimensional analysis . since this is the same as the counting in chiral perturbation theory @xcite , it is usually known as `` weinberg counting '' .",
    "in contrast , in strongly interacting systems with shallow resonances or bound states , simple dimensional analysis is no longer appropriate because of the appearance of new low - energy scales .",
    "these result in a need to resum certain terms @xcite .",
    "this has been done within various frameworks @xcite , all of which lead to the the same power counting .",
    "the resulting scheme is often referred to as `` ksw counting '' . for systems with short - range forces only , it is in fact equivalent to the effective - range expansion developed by bethe and others @xcite .",
    "this expansion is the relevant one for few - nucleon systems at low energies , where the deuteron and the @xmath0 virtual state lie very close to threshold .",
    "it may also apply to atomic systems where feshbach resonances can be tuned to give large scattering lengths .    both of these power - counting schemes can be understood using the wilsonian renormalisation group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "fixed points of the rg describe scale - free systems .",
    "the rg flow near these points can then be used to define a power counting for organising the perturbations around them .",
    "weinberg counting arises from the expansion around the trivial fixed point of the rg , corresponding to a noninteracting system .",
    "ksw counting , or the effective - range expansion , is associated with a second , nontrivial fixed point corresponding to a system with a bound - state exactly at threshold .",
    "the rg approach can also be extended to systems with known long - range interactions , such as the coulomb or one - pion - exchange potentials , provided one has identified all the low - energy scales . in ref .",
    "@xcite we applied this to examples including coulomb and repulsive inverse - square potentials , for which well - defined distorted waves ( dw s ) exist .",
    "we refer to this extended version as the distorted - wave rg ( dwrg ) . in it ,",
    "a cut - off is applied to the basis of dw s of the known long - range potential so that that potential is unaffected by the cut - off .",
    "the advantage of the method is that it provides a clean separation between the short- and long - range physics .",
    "the resulting nontrivial fixed point corresponds to a dw or `` modified '' version of the effective - range expansion @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the dwrg to determine the power - counting for three - body forces .",
    "a very brief account of these ideas was previously presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and a much more extensive one can be found in the ph.d .",
    "thesis , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the eft description of systems of three particles must include three - body forces , represented by six - point interactions in the lagrangian . to develop a model - independent treatment of these systems , we use a two - body eft with couplings fixed by two - body data , and augment it with three - body terms . however a consistent",
    "power counting needs to be determined for these new interactions .",
    "complications arise in three - body systems because there can be long - range forces resulting from the exchange of one of the three particles .",
    "the range of these forces is controlled by the two - body scattering lengths . in weakly interacting systems , where the size of the scattering lengths is determined by the scale of the underlying physics , these forces can be treated as short - range and weinberg counting applies to the three - body interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "systems with shallow bound or virtual states have large two - body scattering lengths and hence long - range forces .",
    "hence for systems where the two - body forces can be organised with ksw counting , the correspnding power - counting for the three - body forces is difficult to determine .",
    "bedaque _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first to look at the problem of short - range three - body forces in eft s .",
    "their method is based on the equation originally derived by skorniakov and ter - martirosian ( stm ) @xcite for systems with zero - range two - body forces . in higher partial waves and in @xmath1-wave nuclear systems with spin or isospin",
    "@xmath2 they found that the three - body interactions are irrelevant ( in the technical rg sense that they vanish as the cut - off is lowered ) .",
    "this is because centrifugal forces or the pauli exclusion principle act to ensure that these systems are insensitive to short - range physics .",
    "in contrast , for three bosons in @xmath1-waves or three @xmath1-wave nucleons with total angular momentum and isospin @xmath3 , there is nothing to prevent all three particles from coming together .",
    "et al . _  found that three - body forces are not merely important in these systems , they are in fact essential for producing well - defined results @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . more recently ,",
    "a power - counting scheme for the three - body forces in these systems has been constructed by renormalising the stm equation order - by - order in the energy @xcite .",
    "our work confirms this power counting within the framework of a full rg analysis .",
    "in other recent work on this problem , phillips and afnan @xcite have looked at the stm equation in the case of three @xmath1-wave bosons .",
    "they were able to reproduce the results of bedaque _ et al . _  by using a subtractive renormalisation and introducing a single piece of three - body data , namely the three - body scattering length .",
    "the introduction of this piece of data is equivalent to the lo three - body force of ref .",
    "similar results have also been obtained by mohr @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the stm equation for three - body systems with contact interations is provided by the work of efimov @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "in general , efimov s equations are difficult to solve ( see , for example , @xcite ) because they involve a nonseparable boundary condition . however ,",
    "in the case of infinite two - body scattering length , the equations become separable in suitable cooordinates and can be solved exactly . in this limit",
    "the hamiltonian becomes scale free , which should not be surprising given that this is the nontrivial fixed point of the two - body system .",
    "in hyperspherical coordinates , the corresponding three - body hamiltonian contains an inverse - square potential ( isp ) .",
    "the strength of the isp is determined by the statistics of the system . in systems with nonzero orbital angular momentum or where the pauli exclusion principle keeps the particles apart",
    ", the potential is repulsive .",
    "however if there is no angular momentum or exclusion principle , as for three @xmath1-wave bosons , there can be an attractive isp .",
    "this corresponds to the cases where bedaque _ et al . _",
    "found a need for a three - body force .",
    "because of its relevance to three - body efts , the attractive isp has been the subject of several recent papers @xcite .",
    "it will also play a central role in this paper , since the dwrg analysis for scattering in the presence of this potential will also provide the basic power counting for the three - body system .",
    "the attractive isp is particularly interesting from a mathematical point of view because it is sufficiently singular that its wave functions have a logarithmic oscillatory behaviour near the origin @xcite .",
    "this makes it impossible to define a `` regular '' boundary condition on the wavefunctions at the origin .",
    "mathematically , the resolution of this quandary is well known : we need to form a self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "more physically , one can think of this as introducing a boundary condition to fix the phase of the oscillatory solutions near the origin .",
    "although choosing a self - adjoint extension ensures that all observables are uniquely defined , it does not lead to a ground state .",
    "instead the bound states form an infinite tower with geometrically spaced energies .",
    "this pattern was found by efimov in the context of three - body systems @xcite , although the lack of a ground state was noted first by thomas @xcite .",
    "the pattern is not quite scale - free since it requires the input of a new scale , such as the energy of one of the bound states .",
    "this scale is provided by the self - adjoint extension .",
    "an alternative to introducing a boundary condition to fix the self - adjoint extension of the isp is to regulate the singularity of the potential at short distances and introduce a counterterm @xcite .",
    "in essence this is what the momentum - space regularisation of the stm equation does for the three - body problem @xcite .",
    "again , one piece of three - body data is needed to fix the scale in the extension , as also noted by phillips and afnan @xcite .",
    "other authors have shown explicitly how a short - range force can be used to select an extension @xcite , but have not developed the power counting for all possible terms in that force .",
    "furthermore , the three - body forces obtained in this manner turn out to be multi - valued , with no obvious procedure to resolve this @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the approaches based on regularisation of the singular interaction is that they exhibit a cyclic behaviour as the scale of the cut - off is varied @xcite .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by wilson @xcite , they form a novel kind of limit cycle of the rg .",
    "several examples of this have only recently been highlighted @xcite .",
    "in addition , braaten and hammer have pointed out that a rather minor fine tuning of the quark masses in qcd would bring the infrared limit of the theory to the effective - range fixed point in the two - nucleon channel , and hence to a limit cycle for three nucleons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the dwrg method , first to the attractive isp corresponding to three - body systems with infinite two - body scattering length , and then to more general attractive three - body systems .",
    "we apply a cut - off to the deeply bound states as well as the continuum , and this leads to an rg equation with single - valued but discontinuous solutions .",
    "as already mentioned , the results confirm the power counting found by bedaque _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . by taking advantage of efimov s separation of the full three - body wave function",
    ", we are able to show that this power counting is not limited to the stm `` slice '' through it , where two of the particles coincide .",
    "because of the clean separation of short- and long - range physics in the dwrg , we are able to derive this counting in a more transparent way .",
    "the lowest - order three - body interaction is marginal , in the sense that its rg flow is only logarithmic in the cut - off . as we shall explicitly show",
    ", it represents the same degree of freedom as the choice of self - adjoint extension .",
    "the resulting three - body interaction is built out of perturbations around a single - valued limit - cycle solution of the dwrg . by constructing the corresponding physical scattering amplitudes ,",
    "we are able to directly relate the coefficients in the three - body potential to observables , through a version of the dw effective - range expansion .",
    "for simplicity , we consider here a system of three bosons of mass @xmath4 , in a state of zero orbital angular momentum .",
    "we assume that the two - body interaction produces a single shallow bound state with binding energy @xmath5 , corresponding to a `` binding momentum '' @xmath6 .",
    "we start by considering the effects of two - body forces only and we denote the corresponding three - body green s function by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is defined in terms of the total centre - of - mass energy by @xmath9 .",
    "this function has the spectral decomposition , @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the unit step function .",
    "note that in a system with two - body contact interactions , we require an additional boundary condition to define the dw s and hence the green s function , as discussed below .",
    "three types of wave appear in this decomposition .",
    "in the first term , we have the bound states of three particles , @xmath12 . in the final term",
    ", we have states with three incoming free particles , @xmath13 , which we label by their total centre - of - mass energy , @xmath14 , and relative momentum , @xmath15 . in the middle are states with one incoming free particle and a bound pair @xmath16 .",
    "these states are normalised as described in appendix a.    in this paper we work with the coordinate - space representation of the dw s .",
    "our eft s are expressed in terms of contact interactions and so we are interested in the region where all three particles are close together .",
    "a natural measure of the proximity of the three particles is the hyperradius , @xmath17 , defined in appendix a. we write the dw s as functions of @xmath17 and the five hyperspherical angles , collectively denoted by @xmath18 , which represent the other degrees of freedom in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the precise specification of these angles is not needed since all @xmath18 dependence will factor out of our results .",
    "now consider the effect of introducing a three - body interaction , @xmath19 .",
    "this could be inserted directly into the faddeev equations @xcite . however , for our purposes , it is sufficient to use the `` two - potential trick '' @xcite to define a @xmath20-matrix for the additional scattering produced by @xmath19 .",
    "we write a full @xmath21 @xmath20-matrix , @xmath22 , in terms of the one with two - body forces only , @xmath23 , plus an additional piece , @xmath24 , that acts between the dw s for the two - body forces : @xmath25 the dw term @xmath24 satisfies the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation , @xmath26 there is no problem with connectedness in this equation since the kernel contains the three - body force .    for zero - range two - body interactions , the small-@xmath17 behaviour of the wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullgreen ] ) can be found from the approach of efimov @xcite .",
    "the essential elements of this , in our notation , are outlined in appendix a. since the wave functions do not have well - defined limits as @xmath27 , we choose our effective three - body interaction to act at some small , but nonzero hyperradius , @xmath28 . at this point",
    "the separations of all three particles are less than or of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "this additional regularisation is quite separate from the running cut - off which will give the rg flow . as with the singular long - range potentials studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is needed to make all wave functions appearing in the rg equation well - defined .",
    "provided we choose @xmath29 to be in the region where the waves have reached their asymptotic small-@xmath17 forms , the common dependence on @xmath17 can be factored out of the problem .",
    "one could therefore imagine taking the @xmath27 limit of the results , corresponding to a zero range force .",
    "in addition , we take the interaction to act at some fixed set of hyperangles @xmath30 .",
    "since the wave functions at small @xmath17 are separable , all hyperangular behaviour can be factored out and this arbitrary choice will not affect the results",
    ". we can therefore define @xmath31    in an eft we aim to integrate out all the unknown short - range physics and replace it by a three - body force which can be expanded in powers of the low - energy scales of the system .",
    "the tool which allows us to determine the scaling behaviour of the terms in @xmath19 is the renormalisation group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "the first step in setting this up is to impose a cut - off , @xmath32 , to separate the low - energy states which we wish to treat explicitly from the high - energy states which will be integrated out .",
    "we then renormalise the theory by making the effective interaction @xmath32-dependent and demanding that observables should be independent of the cut - off .    as in the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we impose this cut - off on the dw s of our pairwise forces . by applying the cut - off to these waves rather than the apparently simpler free waves ,",
    "we ensure that the role of the three - body force is related purely to short - range three - body physics .",
    "if the cut - off were applied to the free waves , it would also remove parts of the physics associated with the two - body forces .",
    "this would have to be compensated by the three - body force , which would then satisfy a far more complicated evolution equation .",
    "we impose the renormalisation condition that amplitude @xmath33 be independent of cut - off , @xmath34 . differentiating the ls equation ( [ eq : tlse ] ) for @xmath33 then leads , after the elimination of @xmath33 , to a differential equation for @xmath19 , @xmath35 the rg equation is then obtained by rescaling the potential @xmath19 and and all the low - energy scales in this equation .",
    "as described below , the definition of the rescaled potential @xmath36 depends upon the form of the dw s close to the origin .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath36 are that it should been analytic in all rescaled energies and momenta .",
    "these follow from our requirement that the terms in the three - body force arise from local six - point vertex terms in the eft lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath32-dependence of the corresponding terms in @xmath36 then allows us to classify them according to some power counting .",
    "so far we have said nothing about the nature of the two - body interaction , except that it leads to a single low - energy bound state .",
    "this could be represented as a contact interaction , whose terms correspond to the effective - range expansion .",
    "equivalently it can be thought of as a boundary condition on the logarithmic derivative of the wave function when two of the particles coincide .",
    "combining this with the overall symmetries of the wave function leads to efimov s boundary condition @xcite , as outlined in appendix a.    this boundary condition becomes separable in the limit where the hyperradius , @xmath17 , is much smaller than the two - body scattering length , @xmath37 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then diagonal in the hyperangular momentum variable , @xmath1 .",
    "the potential in each hyperangular - momentum channel is an isp ( as it must , since all scales have been eliminated from the problem ) .",
    "the resulting schrdinger equation can be solved analytically in terms of bessel functions of general order .    in the cases of three bosons in @xmath1-waves or two neutrons and a proton with total spin @xmath3 , the lowest hyperangular momentum gives rise to an attractive isp .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , there is an ambiguity in the wave functions for this potential . in order to resolve this",
    ", we need to introduce an additional boundary condition to form a self - adjoint extension .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the form of the resulting dw s at small @xmath17 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the magnitude of the smallest hyperangular momentum , @xmath40 is defined in eq.([eq : theta ] ) , @xmath41 is the hyperangular wavefunction , and @xmath42 is the scale introduced by forming a self - adjoint extension .",
    "this form is invariant ( up to an overall sign ) under the replacement , @xmath43 as a consequence all observables are invariant under this transformation and so all of the values of @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p*transf ] ) define the same self - adjoint extension .",
    "in the limit of infinite two - body scattering length , the hamiltonian due to pairwise forces is separable . if we assume also that the three - body force is diagonal in the hyperangular momentum then the rg equations for the various channels are uncoupled .",
    "this approximation neglects parts of the interaction that couple the channels .",
    "we introduce it here so that we can focus on the lowest hyperangular - momentum channel , which contains the leading interactions .",
    "later , when we derive general results , we shall not require it .    the higher hyperangular - momentum channels , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , correspond to repulsive isp s .",
    "their rg analysis is thus identical to that described in ref .",
    "it leads to a power - counting scheme in which the lo term in the force scales with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the scale of the underlying physics .",
    "the most important of the interactions based upon this power counting is the lo term in the @xmath48 channel , but even this term is heavily suppressed .",
    "similarly , in systems which do not lead to attractive isp s , the lowest - order three - body forces are always suppressed by powers of @xmath49 .",
    "here we concentrate on the @xmath50 channel in attractive systems , where the effects of three - body forces are enhanced .",
    "the hyperradial green s function in the @xmath50 channel is given by @xmath51 we use lower case to denote quantities in this channel , for example this green s function and the potential @xmath52 , to differentiate them from those for the full problem .",
    "the dw s @xmath53 are simply solutions of the isp schrdinger equation ( [ eq:2dse ] ) .",
    "the bound states @xmath54 have energies which , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsmom ] ) , form a tower with geometric spacing , @xmath55 these respect the symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p*transf ] ) .",
    "they accumulate at zero energy and extend deeper and deeper with no ground state .",
    "the shallow states are referred to as efimov states , although the lack of a ground state had been noted much earlier . in 1935 ,",
    "thomas @xcite pointed this out for three - body systems bound by contact two - body forces .",
    "before we can write down the dwrg equation for the three - body force in this channel we must first decide how to handle the bound states . in the previous examples studied with the dwrg method @xcite ,",
    "the cut - off was applied purely to the high - energy continuum states . in those examples ,",
    "any bound states were shallow , with typical momenta much smaller than the scale of the underlying physics , and so lay within the domain of the eft . here",
    ", however , the lack of a ground state means that this is no longer true .",
    "the deeply bound states are consequences of our use of contact interactions to represent the two - body forces , and hence are unphysical artefacts . in keeping in the eft philosophy",
    "these states should be truncated and their effects absorbed into the effective three - body force .",
    "we chose to cut - off the green s function by removing all states with energy outside the range @xmath56 : @xmath57 we shall see that truncation of bound states will allow us to get an rg equation with single - valued solutions .    using the separable form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sepwfn ] ) , of the wave functions , we can project the differential equation for the potential ( [ eq : potdiff ] ) onto the @xmath50 channel .",
    "we can then absorb the common angle - dependent factor @xmath58 into into the potential by defining @xmath59 note that we have chosen to focus on potentials that depend only on energy since , as discussed in refs .",

    "this rg equation is the same as that for an attractive isp in two dimensions .",
    "in fact an attractive isp in any number of dimensions leads to an equation of this form , because the different real power of @xmath29 which appears in the short - distance wave functions exactly compensates for the radial factor in the jacobian .",
    "all that differs is a numerical factor in the definition of @xmath64 , associated with the angular integration .",
    "the physically acceptable short - range potentials are given by solutions to the rg equation ( [ eq : dwrg ] ) which satisfy the boundary condition of analyticity in @xmath71 for small @xmath72 .",

    "( [ eq : dwrg ] ) means that no other fixed - point solution can be found .",
    "however that dependence is only logarithmic and so we may look for slowly evolving solutions which also depend logarithmically on @xmath32 .",
    "perturbations about such a solution can still be used to construct a power counting .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our starting point for constructing a nontrivial solution to the rg is the basic loop integral , which in this case is given by @xmath79(\\hat p^2-\\hat q^2)}.\\ ] ] by substituting this for @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwrg2 ] ) , it is straightforward to verify that it satisfies the continuous version of the equation ( without the discontinuities of the final term ) .",
    "however it is not yet an acceptable solution since , apart from missing the bound state discontinuities , it is nonanalyitic for small @xmath72 .",
    "the propagator pole at @xmath80 in the integrand approaches the endpoint of the integral as @xmath81 .",
    "this leads to logarithmic dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath72 . to avoid this troublesome endpoint , and also to introduce the required discontinuities , we need to find a similar integral over some contour in the complex @xmath83-plane avoiding the singular region .",
