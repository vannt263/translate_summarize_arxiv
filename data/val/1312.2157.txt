    "the reflection amplitudes are related to the incidence amplitudes by the four reflection coefficients entering the 2@xmath492 matrix in the following relation : @xmath50 the co - polarized reflectances of the scm half space are denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the cross - polarized ones by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "parametric calculations were made with the scm assumed to be structurally right handed ( @xmath57 ) , with all three of @xmath18 chosen to have very small and positive imaginary parts ( that are indicative of weak dissipation ) .",
    "the reflectances @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 were computed as functions of the angle of incidence @xmath21 and either ( i ) the normalized wavelength @xmath62 for fixed angle of rise @xmath63 or ( ii ) @xmath63 for fixed @xmath62 .    in order to set a baseline for discussion , fig .",

    "the huge excess of @xmath60 over @xmath58 accompanied by very small values of the two other reflectances is the chief manifestation of the circular bragg phenomenon .",

    "[ fig4 ] as functions of @xmath62 and @xmath21 , the following parameters were used : @xmath77 , @xmath66 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows all four reflectances computed as functions of @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath83 , when @xmath65 , @xmath84 , @xmath67 , and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , only one of the three eigenvalues of @xmath16 has a negative real part .",
    "at least four distinct zones of high values of @xmath60 accompanied by almost - zero values of @xmath58 and very low values of both cross - polarized reflectances can be identified in this figure .",
    "similar data computed for @xmath77 , @xmath66 , and @xmath78 are displayed in fig .",

    "to conclude , the concept of hyperbolic structurally chiral materials was introduced in this communication .",
    "the hyperbolicity was found to significantly alter  but not eliminate  the exhibition of the circular bragg phenomenon , which has long been known to be the distinctive signature of non - hyperbolic scms such as cholesteric liquid crystals fergason and chiral sculptured thin films whl00 .",
