    "since the discovery of an extragalactic component for the ir background a decade ago  @xcite , numerous studies have demonstrated the key importance of ir galaxies to reconstruct the history of galaxy star formation and stellar mass assembly .",
    "recent surveys conducted with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ have allowed for the resolution of more than 70% of the mid and far - ir background light  @xcite and a quite detailed understanding of the evolution of ir galaxies with cosmic epoch , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the ir galaxy luminosity function has a strong positive luminosity evolution from redshifts @xmath3 to 1 ( see  @xcite ) , implying that more luminous ir galaxies dominate the ir output with increasing redshift . beyond @xmath4 ,",
    "basically all the ir light is produced by luminous and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , respectively ) with bolometric ir luminosities @xmath5 .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have some significant ( but not yet well - determined ) contribution to the ir background and govern the shape of the bright - end of the mid - ir lf at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the study of the optical spectra of ir galaxies can reveal several aspects of the physical conditions in which star formation and agn activity take place .",
    "what is the evolutionary stage of the hosts of ir activity ?",
    "what is the relationship between dust emission and the observed reddening in optical bands ? does the ir phase accompany all the process of star formation or is it set at a particular time ?",
    "the large sample of zcosmos spectra  @xcite being taken over the 2 deg@xmath7 cosmos field offers a perfect opportunity to address these questions .",
    "the cosmos survey  @xcite is composed of multi - wavelength observations over 2 deg@xmath7 of the sky at nearly equatorial latitudes . among these observations , a large spectroscopic campaign is being carried out with the vimos spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt ) , namely the zcosmos survey  @xcite .",
    "the zcosmos survey consists of two parts : 1 ) zcosmos - bright , whose aim is to obtain 20,000 optical spectra for a magnitude - limited @xmath8 ( ab mag ) source sample and which is now half - way complete ; 2 ) zcosmos - deep , which will yield 10,000 optical spectra in the central 1 deg@xmath7 of the field , for galaxies colour - selected to be at high redshifts .",
    "the cosmos field is also completely covered by deep _ spitzer _",
    "maps from 3.6 through 160 @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these data have been obtained as part of two _ spitzer _ legacy programs in the observation cycles 2 and 3 .",
    "we present some of the first results of a series of studies we are conducting to analyse the optical spectral properties of 24 @xmath0-selected galaxies in the cosmos field .",
    "we particularly focus here on the brightest ir galaxies ( @xmath1 ) found at redshifts @xmath2 , whereas a complete study of the zcosmos - bright spectra of more than 600 @xmath9 galaxies is presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the completed first half of the zcosmos - bright program provides us with good - quality redshifts and spectra for 24 ir galaxies with @xmath1 over 1.5 deg@xmath7 of the cosmos field .",
    "these galaxies are tracers of the most intense star - formation and/or agn activity and , within zcosmos - bright , 22 out of 24 are found at redshifts @xmath2 . among these 24 brightest ir galaxies with @xmath8 ( ab mag ) ,",
    "only 3 are identified with agn from their optical spectra and/or x - ray emission .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ @xmath10-band postage stamps and zcosmos spectra for four of these ir sources with @xmath1 .",
    "the four examples correspond to galaxies at redshifts @xmath11 . in all these cases ,",
    "the optical spectra display prominent emission lines , which are characteristic of actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , the intrinsic emission is even larger in all these galaxies , as all of them have at least mildly important degrees of dust obscuration , with @xmath12-band extinctions ranging between @xmath13 and 2.5 ( as obtained by equating the [ ir+uv ] and the optically - derived star formation rates ) .",
    "the _ acs _ stamps of the four example galaxies reveal compact nuclear morphologies , where two different objects can be resolved in each case .",
    "these are probably galaxies in an advanced stage of a merger , as most of the brightest ir galaxies are thought to be .",
    "_ acs _ @xmath10-band postage stamps and zcosmos spectra for four galaxies with @xmath1 in the cosmos field .",
    "all these four galaxies are probably in the last stage of a merger.,width=453 ]    the equivalent widths of the emission lines provide information on the strength of the emission produced by the new generations of stars with respect to the underlying older stellar populations , which mostly contribute to the spectral continuum . figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the h@xmath14 and h@xmath15 equivalent widths , respectively , for the @xmath16 galaxies ( filled circles ) , in comparison to the equivalent widths of all the other @xmath9 sources ( cross - like symbols ) .",
    "h@xmath14 measurements have been performed for galaxies at @xmath17 and h@xmath15 measurements correspond to galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "the equivalent widths are only shown in the cases that they are larger than 5 @xmath19 .",
    "the h@xmath14 equivalent widths of the ir galaxies with @xmath16 as a function of redshift ( filled circles ) , in comparison to all the other galaxies with @xmath9 ( cross - like symbols).,width=302 ]     the h@xmath15 equivalent widths of the ir galaxies with @xmath16 as a function of redshift , in comparison to all the other galaxies with @xmath9 .",
    "symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig2].,width=302 ]    inspection of figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] shows that some of the brightest ir galaxies display very large h@xmath14 or h@xmath15 equivalent widths .",
    "however , in many other cases , the equivalent widths are much smaller and indistinguishable of those of fainter ir galaxies . thus , as other optical spectral characteristics  @xcite , the balmer line equivalent widths have little correlation with the ir photometric properties .",
    "this simple comparison of equivalent widths illustrates the heterogeneity of the sources making the brightest ir - galaxy population at low redshifts .",
    "the differences in equivalent widths are to some extent due to the different relative importance that the previously formed stars have in these galaxies .",
    "some of the brightest ir galaxies are relatively young systems still in the process of chemical enrichment , while others are already - massive galaxies with strong stellar continua , which might possibly be forming their last generations of stars  @xcite .",
    "with the availability of the deepest 24 @xmath0 images for the cosmos field down to flux limits @xmath20 , we will be able to explore the variations of optical spectral properties of mid - ir galaxies over a wide range of ir luminosities .",
    "on the other hand , by next year , zcosmos - deep will already have produced one of the largest samples of optical spectra for galaxies at redshifts @xmath21 .",
    "this will enable us to conduct an unprecedented study of the rest - frame uv spectral properties of ir galaxies and to compare them to the spectra of other known high-@xmath22 galaxy populations , as e.g. lyman - break galaxies ."
