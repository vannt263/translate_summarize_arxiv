    "in usual hydrodynamic description of high - energy heavy - ion collisions , one customarily assumes some highly symmetric and smooth initial conditions , which correspond to mean distributions of velocity , temperature , energy density , etc .",
    ", averaged over several events .",
    "however , our systems are not large enough , so large fluctuations are expected . what are the effects of the event - by - event fluctuation of the initial conditions ?",
    "are they sizable ?",
    "do they depend on the equation of state ? which are the most sensitive variables ?",
    "these are some questions which arise regarding such an initial - state fluctuation , and we try to shed some light on these matters in the present study@xcite .",
    "in order to study the problem stated above , first we generate events by using the nexus event generator@xcite , from which initial conditions are computed at the time @xmath1fm .",
    "then , the hydrodynamic equations are solved , starting from these initial conditions , assuming some equation of state ( eos ) . to see the eos dependence of the effects we are treating , we consider two different eoss@xcite :    1 .",
    "resonance gas ( rg ) : @xmath2 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath3    the resolution of the hydrodynamic equations deserves some special care , since our initial conditions do not have any symmetry nor they are smooth .",
    "we adopt the so - called smoothed - particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) approach@xcite , first used in astrophysics and which we have previously adapted for heavy - ion collisions@xcite , a method flexible enough , giving a desired precision .",
    "the main characteristic of sph is the parametrization of the flow in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates attached to small volumes ( called `` particles '' ) with some conserved quantity . in the present work , besides the energy and momentum , we took the entropy as our conserved quantity .",
    "then , its density ( in the space - fixed frame ) is parametrized as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and we have @xmath6    the equations of motion are then written as the coupled equations @xmath7\\ ,         { \\bf\\nabla}_i w({\\bf x}_{\\,i}-{\\bf x}_{\\,j};h)=0\\,.\\ \\ \\ ] ]    following this procedure , we computed some observable quantities , event - by - event , for @xmath8130@xmath9gev @xmath10 collisions .",
    "the results are presented in the next section .",
    "having solved the coupled equations ( 3 ) , we have computed the particle spectra at @xmath12 and from which the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath13 on an event - by - event basis . in figure 1 , we show its distributions for a fixed impact parameter @xmath14 , for the two eos considered .",
    "as expected , @xmath11 exhibits a large fluctuation , which depends on the eos .",
    "one should take care in looking at this figure that our @xmath14 is the true impact parameter ( not determined in the way experimentalists do ) , so for instance in the rg case , there are some events with negative @xmath13 , which experimentally would not appear . as for the average values",
    "@xmath15 , it is almost independent of the eos",
    ". this is shown in figure 2 , where @xmath16 is plotted as function of the centrality and compared with data@xcite .",
    "it is seen that @xmath17 reproduces well the experimental trend , whereas the dispersions @xmath18 are much wider than the experimental errors . as for the eos dependence ,",
    "@xmath18 is smaller when qgp is produced .",
    "= 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    = 6.2 cm    = 6.2 cm      in figure 3 , we show the @xmath19 distributions for 5 events . as expected , @xmath19 distributions are in general steeper when qgp is produced . as for fluctuations ,",
    "the resultant fluctuation in @xmath19 spectrum ( or in the slope parameter @xmath20 ) is very small .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results of our study on multiplicity fluctuation in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "it is seen that _",
    "i ) _ as @xmath21 , @xmath22 becomes much larger with the qgp eos ; _ ii ) _",
    "@xmath23 shows the same tendency in this limit ; _ iii ) _ as for the ratio @xmath24 , it is not sensitive to the eos .",
    ".eos dependence of the multiplicity fluctuation in two different rapidity intervals @xmath25 , as function of the impact parameter @xmath14 .",

    "the present study shows that the effects of the event - by - event fluctuation of the initial conditions in hydrodynamics are sizable and should be considered in data analyses .",
    "they do depend on the equation of state . among the quantities examined here ,",
    "@xmath18 is the most sensitive to the equation of state .    in the present work ,",
    "many important factors have not been considered : baryon - number conservation , strangeness production , resonance decays , continuous emission effects , spectators , etc . , which should indeed taken into account in order to get more precise results .",
    "especially , use of the same procedure for the determination of the centrality as used by experimentalists , as in@xcite , will make the results more directly comparable with data . in any event , we believe that the effects we studied will be present and",
    "will be sizable , even with these improvements .",
