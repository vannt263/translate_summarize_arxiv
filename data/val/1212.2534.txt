    "recent years have seen the growth of complex networks theory , a research area concerned with the general theory of systems of interacting elements  @xcite .",
    "its relevance has been illustrated in a number of problems , such as infectious disease propagation  @xcite , the strength of social ties  @xcite , data routing in technological networks  @xcite , and motifs in biological networks  @xcite .",
    "an underlying driver for the growth of this field has been the increased availability of digitized information , which can be efficiently analyzed to uncover relations between system elements .",
    "a simplifying assumption that is made in networks theory is to characterize interactions as being exclusively pairwise ( each interaction represented by a link between two nodes ) , often with an associated interaction intensity or weight , generating so - called weighted networks ( also known as weighted graphs in mathematics ) .",
    "the reason for this approach is that usually the information available for real systems is relatively limited . despite these limitations , weighted networks",
    "have proven very useful , as a number of measurable network quantities have shown their relevance in application .",
    "examples of these quantities are the distribution of node degree  @xcite ( number of links connecting to a node ) , optimal path lengths between network nodes  @xcite , and node clustering  @xcite ( a measure of loops of length three ) .",
    "other properties that depend on specific groups of links ( e.g. , network communities ) have also proven quite useful  @xcite .",
    "there are situations , however , where it is known that interactions extend to groups larger than two ( multiway interactions ) , and one can use such information to create more accurate models , avoiding the possibility of oversimplified or misleading results . examples of these situations are , for instance , networks of affiliations  @xcite , where nodes representing individuals connect to each other by virtue of their membership to a group such as their family or workplace colleagues ; another example are folksonomies  @xcite , systems that encode information of triplets of the following three ingredients : objects , descriptors of the objects , and the individuals making the descriptions .",
    "characterizing these examples by avoiding the pairwise simplification should lead to more informative and reliable results .    through various independent approaches ,",
    "researchers focusing on problems of multiway interactions have proposed mechanisms by which pairwise network weights are generated as a consequence of these interactions ( see , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , in affiliation networks , when two nodes belong simultaneously to multiple groups , a feature called co - membership , it is assumed that their relationship intensity is equal to the number of groups they both belong to .",
    "perhaps the most appealing feature of these ideas is that they provide a unifying principle to the structure of some interacting systems : the presence of a group generates links , and being part of multiple groups generates weights .",
    "surprisingly , these unifying ideas have received limited attention , perhaps because some of the mathematical models that are required are less straightforward than typical networks .",
    "here , i focus on a systematic approach grounded in statistical mechanics to relate multiway interactions to weighted networks .",
    "to model multiway interactions , it is appropriate to use hypergraphs , which are generalizations of networks  @xcite .",
    "they are composed of a set of nodes and a set of hyperedges .",
    "each hyperedge is a group of interconnected nodes ( a clique ) , and the hypergraph is the collection of all the hyperedges and isolated nodes ; networks are the specialization of hypergraphs in which all hyperedges are cliques each with only two nodes , i.e. , links .",
    "the size of a hyperedge is called rank . in a statistical mechanics formulation ( random )",
    "hypergraphs are called homogeneous when all hyperedges are equally likely to be present , or heterogeneous when each hyperedge has its own ( possibly unique ) probability to appear . for the examples mentioned above : in a folksonomy , for instance , hyperedges are all of rank three , whereas in affiliation networks , in principle , hyperedges can have different ranks ; both examples are likely to be heterogeneous hypergraphs .",
    "the notion of hypergraphs generating weights is equivalent to constructing networks that represent a projection of a hypergraph . in other words , starting from a hypergraph , one can create an associated set of links that form a _ weighted projected network _",
    ", where each link weight is given by the structure of the hypergraph and a projection rule .",
    "this construction suggests some intriguing possibilities : some data that is typically studied as a network may in fact emerge from underlying hypergraphs .",
    "if that is the case , it should be possible in principle to construct hypergraph models and accompanying projections that can fit observed data and narrow down its origins .    in this article",
    ", i study homogeneous and heterogeneous entropy maximizing hypergraph ensembles of arbitrary uniform rank @xmath0 and define general projections of hypergraphs that lead to ensembles of weighted projected networks .",
    "some specific projection examples that have been used in the literature are explored  @xcite , the properties of their respective projected networks calculated , and their interpretations briefly discussed .",
    "the percolation threshold and size of the largest connected component of hypergraphs of arbitrary uniform rank are also derived by use of the mapping between the potts model and percolation theory  @xcite , and the results are then translated into the percolation properties of the projected networks .",
    "these results show that the transition is of second order .",
    "i find that , as a function of size , the link weights on weighted projected networks can display a signature of the presence of hidden multiway relations : when faced with a weighted network , this signature could provide indications that there is an associated hypergraph hidden in the data .    the article is structured in the following way : sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] with some discussion and conclusions .",
    "consider a hypergraph , represented by @xmath1 , consisting of a set of nodes @xmath2 , and for each possible hyperedge of @xmath0 nodes @xmath3 , an indicator @xmath4 equal to 1 if the hyperedge is present and 0 if it is absent ; all subindices @xmath3 take non - repeated values from the set @xmath5 . in general , a hypergraph does not require @xmath0 to be the same for all hyperedges .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , i focus on single rank ( all hyperedges have the same @xmath0 ) undirected hypergraphs , with the indicator @xmath4 symmetric under permutations of @xmath3 ( if one is interested in studying combinations of rank , one merely requires the introduction of the proper parameters for this , but the qualitative nature of the problem is the same as that studied here ) .",
    "unweighted undirected networks correspond to @xmath6 .",
    "the general hypergraph projection onto a network is defined as a function @xmath7 applied over hyperedges of @xmath1 that produces the adjacency matrix @xmath8 for the weighted projected network @xmath9 .",
    "network @xmath9 is formed by the same node set as @xmath1 , and its adjacency matrix is @xmath8 .",
    "if a node does not belong to any hyperedge , it is isolated in both @xmath1 and @xmath9 . for given @xmath1",
    ", one can define the subset @xmath10 of its hyperedges that include simultaneously nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the kinds of projections studied here are of the type @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the size ( cardinality ) of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the weight of link @xmath16 in @xmath9 only depends on the number of hyperedges that contain @xmath11 and @xmath12 , an intuitive choice , although certainly not the only possible model ( in the literature , all examples i have found are limited to this kind of projection  @xcite ) .    on a concrete empirical case",
    ", the projection @xmath7 should reflect the understanding of the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "here , i present results for some reasonable sample choices of @xmath17 , namely @xmath18 ( additive projection ) and @xmath19 ( nominal projection ) , where @xmath20 is the heaviside step function ( @xmath21 if the argument is 0 or less , and 1 otherwise ) .",
    "in addition , i show some features satisfied by the projected networks generated by a large class of projections with the general form of eq .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ wij - project - illustration ] .    in the literature , both hypergraphs and projections have been used to study interaction data qualitatively embedded in complex networks theory , but without a sense of unification .",
    "for instance , the choice @xmath26 is implicit in work such as  @xcite ; there , if @xmath4 is interpreted as a specific motif ( structural pattern ) , the model generates unweighted networks guaranteed to posses those motifs . in another approach , found in refs .",
    "@xcite , each hypergraph ( containing @xmath6 and 3 only ) treats each rank separately in that the interactions of nodes by way of pairs is counted independently to the triplet interactions , with no notion of projection onto a simple network .",
    "@xcite do consider projections in some form , but are limited by rank @xmath0 of hypergraph and by the nature of the projection .",
    "projection @xmath24 is in fact common  @xcite , and it is often used as a way to characterize the one - mode networks that emerge from bipartite graphs  @xcite ( recent work also uses the notion of projection in the context of time evolving networks  @xcite ) .",
    "( [ wij - p ] ) offers a unified way to relate networks and hypergraphs , which can be applied to the models cited above to develop additional understanding of the problems .    to build unbiased statistical models , i adapt to hypergraphs the canonical ensemble approach developed in ref .",
    "the set of all possible hypergraphs @xmath1 is given by @xmath27 ( the ensemble ) , or in other words , @xmath27 is the union of all possible unique hypergraphs @xmath1 . to analytically formulate the ensemble problem ,",
    "consider the entropy @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the probability of a given configuration within the hypergraph ensemble , and the sum over configurations is equivalent to summing over all hyperedge combinations , or @xmath31 .",
    "the canonical ensemble approach finds the distribution @xmath30 that maximizes @xmath28 while satisfying conditions that define the ensemble of interest .",

    "the solution to the problem can be expressed as @xmath38 the partition function @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( _ defined _ as the hamiltonian ) , are respectively given by @xmath41 and @xmath42    among the simplest non - trivial problems one can address is that of the fully random hypergraph with equal probability for any hyperedge to exist .",
    "the constraint associated with this example is the requirement that there is a given average number of hyperedges , @xmath43 , over the hypergraph ensemble . since",
    "@xmath44 for a given configuration @xmath1 is given by @xmath45 , the set of constraints reduces to two lagrange multipliers , one for the normalization , and another parameter , labelled @xmath46 , for @xmath43 . introducing this in eq .",
    "( [ lagrange - problem ] ) generates the hamiltonian @xmath47 and the partition function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the set of all possible hyperedges @xmath50 , i.e. , the complete hypergraph of single rank @xmath0 and size @xmath51",
    ". the last equality can also be obtained from the symmetry of the hamiltonian over exchange of indices among @xmath4 .",
    "the result expresses that there are @xmath52 possible hyperedges @xmath53 among the @xmath51 nodes . using this result",
    "one can show that the @xmath43 constraint is satisfied for the proper choice of @xmath46 , as seen from averaging @xmath54 in the @xmath30 ensemble @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the probability for a hyperedge to be present , which is evident from writing @xmath57 ; @xmath58 also corresponds to the expectation value of any hyperedge @xmath59 , i.e. , the probability for any hyperedge to exist .",
    "the fact that all hyperedges are equally likely suggests referring to this case as the _ homogeneous hypergraph ensemble_. the probability of a specific hypergraph configuration to be observed is given by eq .",
    "( [ lagrange - solution ] ) , which in this case yields @xmath60 where the relations @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been used .",
    "the application of the @xmath24 and @xmath63 to the homogeneous ensemble is tackled below in a more general ensemble .",
    "the solution to the simple homogeneous problem above , helps to identify some basic features of the canonical approach , including quantities such as the probability of a hyperedge , and of a specific hypergraph @xmath1 .",
    "building on this , one can construct the more general _ heterogeneous _ case , where each hyperedge has its own expectation @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath65 in analogy with the homogeneous case , one defines @xmath66 .",
    "the partition function becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the hyperedge expectations @xmath69 .",
    "the probability of a hypergraph configuration @xmath1 is then @xmath70 which is the joint probability that hyperedges with @xmath71 are present , and those with @xmath72 are absent . if for all @xmath73 , @xmath74 , one recovers the homogeneous case .",
    "the heterogeneous ensemble possesses the most degrees of freedom among non - interacting undirected hypergraph models .",
    "if more specific constraints are imposed such as , for instance , conditions on the average number of hyperedges visiting a node , they would translate into additional constraints on the values of the set @xmath68 ( see e.g. discussion at end of sec .",
    "[ applications ] ) .",
    "since only projections of the form @xmath75 are considered here , the statistical properties of the projected networks depend on the statistical properties of @xmath76 .",
    "it is most useful to focus on the distribution of @xmath76 in the heterogeneous ensemble , @xmath77 , and determine how this translates into the homogeneous case ( table  [ table - phi_oij ] summarizes the notation used to compute @xmath77 ) .",
    "let us define @xmath78 as the set of all hyperedges on the complete hypergraph that visit @xmath11 and @xmath12 simultaneously .",
    "i also define @xmath79 , the complement of @xmath78 with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , for each configuration @xmath1 , @xmath80 is the set of hyperedges visiting @xmath11 and @xmath12 which may or may not have cardinality @xmath76 ( if it does , it is represented as before with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the complement of @xmath80 with respect to @xmath78 is @xmath81 , and thus @xmath82 . taking this into account",
    ", @xmath77 can be calculated through the expression @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the kronecker delta which can have two or more arguments , and is equal to 1 if all the arguments are equal , and 0 otherwise . in the sum",
    "above , only those configurations for which delta is 1 contribute to @xmath77 , and this occurs only when there are exactly @xmath76 hyperedges in @xmath1 that include @xmath16 .    to perform the calculation , note the independence of each component of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ psigma_hetero ] ) .",
    "this allows factoring the sum over configurations in eq .",
    "( [ phi_oij_def ] ) into a product of i ) the configurations of hyperedges @xmath79 , which can not affect the delta , and ii ) the configurations of hyperedges @xmath78 , which can .",
    "the hyperedges @xmath85 each contribute a factor @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the remaining factors of eq .",

    "equation  ( [ phi_oij_final ] ) has been expressed in a way that makes it straightforward to explain and convert into an algorithm for calculation , as i attempt to explain now .",
    "the expression can be described in the following terms : i ) separate the hyperedges from @xmath49 into two groups , one that can influence @xmath16 over all possible configurations , namely @xmath78 , and another that can not ( @xmath79 ) , ii ) identify out of @xmath78 the hyperedges of @xmath1 visiting @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath80 , iii ) only when @xmath91 , @xmath1 contributes to @xmath77 , and iv ) since there are numerous ways to choose @xmath15 from @xmath78 , one requires the set @xmath89 , which contains all those choices , i.e. , is the ensemble of allowed configurations .",
    "consequently , the last line of eq .",
    "( [ phi_oij_final ] ) can be read as the sum of probabilities over all possible configurations @xmath89 of hyperedge sets @xmath15 , where each hyperedge belongs to @xmath78 .",
    "note that there are @xmath92 hyperedges to choose from and each @xmath15 ( configuration @xmath1 ) picks @xmath76 of them , and therefore @xmath93 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath1 is used in @xmath15 to emphasize its origin as a particular hypergraph configuration , but that it becomes redundant when the meaning of @xmath89 is fixed as the collection of configurations ( the ensemble ) contributing to @xmath77 ; at this point , each @xmath94 specifies a unique configuration and no further reference to @xmath1 is necessary .    in fact , dropping @xmath1 from @xmath94 offers a combinatorial picture for the last line of eq .",
    "( [ phi_oij_final ] ) and other distributions in this section .",
    "since each @xmath1 is a set of hyperedges connecting non - repeated nodes in cliques of rank @xmath0 , one can think of each hyperedge as an @xmath0-tuple of non - repeated indices taken from @xmath5 , and a configuration @xmath1 as a collection of non - repeated @xmath0-tuples .",

    "the cardinalities of all the sets calculated before follow naturally .    the average of @xmath76 can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ phi_oij_final ] ) , through @xmath95 , or by calculating @xmath96 .",
    "the result is @xmath97 which fits intuition , stating that the expectation of the number of hyperedges visiting the pair @xmath16 , is the sum of expectations of each hyperedge that can visit @xmath16 to be present over the ensemble .    in the homogeneous case , where @xmath74 for all @xmath53 , @xmath98 becomes @xmath99 a binomial distribution with @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "[ distributions](a ) ) . both this average , and more generally eq .  ( [ avg_oij_final ] ) , have an interesting interpretation explained below regarding signatures of multiway interactions in observational studies . another noteworthy fact exhibited by eq .",
    "( [ phi_oij_homo_final ] ) , even in this very simple case of homogeneous @xmath58 , is that @xmath76 does not have a fixed value but instead follows a probability distribution consequence of the projection process .",
    "some general features of @xmath7 can now be described if one conditions it to be a monotonic smooth projection , satisfying the inverse function theorem .",
    "this condition offers a way to formally write the distribution of @xmath8 from the distribution of @xmath76 because there is a one - to - one relation between the two quantities .",
    "furthermore , one can make use of the monotonicity in both the discrete and continuous variable cases . for the discrete case , defining the distribution @xmath101 of weights , it is simple to see that @xmath102 and the set of possible @xmath8 is obtained by applying eq .",
    "( [ wij - p ] ) to the domain of @xmath76 . in the continuous case ,",
    "introducing the densities @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the change of variables theorem for probability distributions implies @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the derivative of @xmath7 .",
    "the additive projection @xmath24 satisfies monotonicity in a trivial way because it is just the identity function .",
    "however , a large class of functions also satisfy monotonicity , including all power law and logarithmic growth functions . the nominal projection , on the other hand ,",
    "does not satisfy the condition because any value of @xmath107 leads to the same weight @xmath108 , and thus the inverse of @xmath63 is not uniquely defined . regarding the influence of @xmath109 ,",

    "let us assume that @xmath51 increases to @xmath117 , and each new node @xmath118 connects to @xmath16 via new hyperedges .",

    "( [ phi_oij_homo_final ] ) .",
    "the relevance of this result lies in the fact that there is a qualitative change in the behavior of @xmath111 for @xmath6 and @xmath112 . in the former @xmath131 which does not scale with @xmath51 , but",
    "in the later it scales as @xmath132  @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath112 makes @xmath111 monotonically increasing with @xmath51 . to appreciate the importance of this , consider a weighted network where one observes that link weights @xmath133 and size @xmath51 evolve together with positive correlation ( say , both @xmath51 and the set of @xmath133 grow together ) .",
    "two possible qualitative pictures come to mind to explain this behavior : i ) the underlying system is in fact composed of a number of multiway interactions that superimpose to produce a weighted network , roughly as described in this article , or ii ) the system is pairwise , but the addition of nodes not only introduces edges between each new node and an old existing node , but also the existing nodes tend to strengthen the connections between each other by some additional mechanism . the later model ,",
    "although possible , is much less natural , and represents a less economical explanation of the correlation between @xmath51 and link weights .",
    "therefore , being conservative in our interpretation , if @xmath51 is positively correlated with some or all of the @xmath133 , this should be taken as a first indication that multiway interactions can be present .",
    "note that the absence of correlations between @xmath51 and @xmath133 does not exclude the presence of multiway interactions , as specific cases may have additional effects not covered here that may obscure the signatures , e.g. , local multiway relations , interactions between hyperedges , etc .",
    "certainly , one could argue that for there to be a weighted network with the behavior described here , it is also necessary to impose conditions on the type of projection that applies .",
    "this is indeed true , but the conditions necessary to obtain correlation between @xmath133 and @xmath51 are relatively modest and well justified in numerous circumstances .",
    "for instance , here i focus on a monotonically increasing @xmath7 , which proves sufficient .",
    "furthermore , it is even acceptable to have a @xmath115 that decreases with @xmath51 , just as long as the decrease is slower than @xmath134 .",
    "the level of detail known about @xmath7 and @xmath113 goes hand in hand with the detail that can be learned about the multiway interactions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath135 ( homogeneous ) and @xmath136 , then @xmath137 vs. @xmath138 would yield the value of @xmath0 .",
    "if , on the other hand , all one knows is that @xmath7 is monotonically increasing , the @xmath137 vs. @xmath138 would offer an estimate of the combined effects of @xmath7 and @xmath113 .",
    "overall , the present discussion suggest that _ in the case of evolving networks with correlations between @xmath51 and the set of @xmath133 , it is reasonable to suspect multiway interactions active in the background , and further exploration for evidence of such interactions is well justified . _",
    "these results are general , and do not need to be specialized into a particular example .",
