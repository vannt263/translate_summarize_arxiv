    "in the quark model , the baryons are represented as bound states of three quarks , confined by strong forces .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) aknowledged as the theory of strong interactions , is however not able to describe unambigously the strong - coupling regime , which requests alternative theories , like flux - tube model , bag model , qcd string model , lattice qcd , or phenomenological potential models .",
    "we will use in this work a phenomenological potential model describing explicitely the qcd characteristics , and taking into account some relativistic effects .",
    "the potential model is essentially motivated by the experiment , and its wave functions are used to represent the states of strong interaction and to describe the hadrons .",
    "the most used is the harmonic oscillator potential which requires very simple calculations and qualitatively in agreement with the experimental data ; on the other hand , the most usual potential models are using non relativistic kinematics , which is convenient for the heavy flavors systems , but can not be suitable for the hadrons containing light flavors .    in this paper , we study the non - strange baryons spectrum in two different orbital momentum states within a quark model framework .",
    "we calculate the mass of baryons in the ground - state ( @xmath0 ) with positive parity , and in the first excited state ( @xmath1 ) with negative parity .",
    "the method used is variational calculation using schrdinger equation .",
    "the baryon being a three - quarks system , we expose a three - body problem , and the method used to resolve it .    in section 2 , we first introduce the hamiltonian of our system .",
    "we use a potential of the coulombian+linearform , which reproduces well the confinement and asymptotic freedom in qcd . for the kinetic part of our hamiltonian",
    ", we have added a semi - relativistic correction .    in section 3 , we develop the wave function of our system corresponding to ground - state using jacobi variables .",
    "then we diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix and minimise it to extract the baryon mass value . to improve this value , we add the hyperfine correction which contains two terms .",
    "the first one ( called the contact term ) takes into account the spin - spin interaction , and it correlates the splitting of @xmath7 , @xmath8 in the ground state . the second one , called the tensor term , averages to zero for orbital momentum @xmath0 .    in section 4 , we study the case of p - wave baryons with negative parity .",
    "we use the same development as for the s - wave baryons to extract masses for the first excited state @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the tensor term is operative , and allows us to obtain mixing angles .",
    "our results are then compared with the work of isgur and karl @xcite .",
    "several potential models were carried out until now for the determination of the baryon mass spectrum in non - perturbative qcd . in general , one uses the harmonic oscillator ( @xcite , @xcite ) approach in the quark model .",
    "the result obtained is in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this approach provides a good determination of ground state and excited states of the baryon energy spectrum .",
    "the hamiltonian used is in the form :    @xmath9    where * @xmath10 * is the kinetic part , and the harmonic oscillator potential is in the following form :    @xmath11    @xmath12 represents the hyperfine correction .    a more appropriate potential is to be the so - called `` coulombic+ linear '' one : complicated non - perturbative effects are assumed to be largely absorbed into the constituent quark masses and into a lorentz scalar linear confinement potential , the known short range behaviour of qcd is included in the one gluon exchange `` coulombic '' potential . in this approach",
    "the potential is defined as follows @xcite :    @xmath13    the @xmath14 factor represents the color term , with @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the constants ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , c ) are the phenomenological parameters determined from an experimental fit .    in the present work ,",
    "the calculation of the non - strange baryons spectrum is carried out , by using the parameters of reference @xcite .",
    "the results obtained will be discussed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the relativistic schrdinger equation describing a system with three quarks is in the form :    @xmath19    but another term , essentially relativistic and more convenient for many - body problems than the kinetic part of the hamiltonian given by equation ( ( ei ) ) , can be used : @xmath20    with the conditions :    @xmath21    as in reference @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* @xmath22 * represents the quark dynamical masses .",

    "this energy will be minimized w.r.t the variational parameters of the test wave function and ( @xmath22).the potential @xmath25 is treated overall here like a non - perturbative term . in reference",
    "@xcite , @xmath25 is written in the form of harmonic oscillator potential ( @xmath26 ) plus an unknown u - term ( treated like a perturbation ) added to shift the energies of some states ( using the oscillator harmonic wave function ) .    in our work ,",
    "we concentrate on the determination of the ground - state nucleon mass , by minimizing the total energy .",
    "this method allows us to fix the auxiliary dynamical masses ( * @xmath22 * ) and the wave function parameters .",
    "we use the same method to determine the excited - state nucleon mass .",
    "the wave function parameter and * @xmath22 * found for @xmath0 are different from the ones found for @xmath1 .",
    "the baryon being a three - body system , so the problem is in the calculation of the energy eigenvalue , which contains an integral of nine variables . before choosing the form of the test wave function ,",
    "one defines the coordinates of jacobi @xmath27 , which make it possible to pass from a three - body system to an equivalent two - body system .",
    "these two relative coordinates represent respectively the distance between the first two quarks ( @xmath28 ) , and the distance between the third quark @xmath29 and the center of mass of the system @xmath30 .",
    "the jacobi coordinates are defined as @xcite :    @xmath31    using these coordinates , we obtain the relative hamiltonian @xmath32 written in the following form :    @xmath33    with :    @xmath34  ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the quark flavors )    @xmath37    the potential @xmath38 is written in the form    @xmath39",
    "in this part , one concentrates on the determination of the ground - states masses of non - strange baryons with orbital momentum l=0 .",
    "the parameter of the wave function and masses ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) are determined using the variational treatment .",
    "the total wave function @xmath42 of the system is in general constructed from the sum of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 represent respectively the color , spin , spatial and flavor wave functions , with * @xmath45 * totally antisymmetric .",
    "@xmath46    the indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 mean the antisymmetry and symmetry under the exchange of any pair of quarks of equal masses .",
    "@xmath49    one restricts oneself here to the spatial wave function for the calculation carried out with the hamiltonian @xmath32 . to calculate the hyperfine correction",
    ", one will take the total wave function defined in section @xmath50 .",
    "these corrections will give us the mass splitting between nucleon and @xmath51 . the spatial wave function @xmath52 selected to describe our system in the fundamental state @xmath53 , is a gaussian that one develops on the possible states of the angular momenta of the systems @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "these states are indexed by @xmath54 , @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the spatial wave function used in our calculation is in the following form :    @xmath57y_{l_{\\rho } } ^{m_{\\rho } } ( \\omega _ { \\rho } ) y_{l_{\\lambda } } ^{m_{\\lambda } } ( \\omega _ { \\lambda } )   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 are coefficients determined by diagonalisation of the @xmath32 matrix .",
    "the minimization of the system energy allows the determination of the variational parameters of the spatial wave function @xmath59 and the dynamical masses @xmath60 .",
    "the average value of the energy over the function @xmath61 is given by the following relation :    @xmath62    the only clebsch - gordan coefficients different from zero are those which couple the orbital momentum associated to the jacobian coordinates ( @xmath63 ) with the total orbital momentum @xmath0 , and we have : @xmath64the expression ( [ l ] ) yields the constraint ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "so the states of this subsystem ( @xmath63 ) which contribute to the spatial wave function have all the same orbital momentum , starting with @xmath66 . from parity we have @xmath67 , so ( @xmath68 ) is even .",
    "we do our treatment up to order @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 , since for higher orders the analytical calculation becomes very complicated , moreover the contribution of the orbital momentum terms @xmath71 is less important @xcite .",
    "the total wave function must obey the pauli exclusion principle . in the baryon we have two identical quarks ,",
    "so the spatial wave function must be symmetrical in the exchange of these two quarks @xmath72 , this implies that in the relative system , the function should be even in @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "so in expression ( [ psilm ] ) , @xmath75 must be even .",
    "finally , by eliminating the contribution of the odd states in @xmath75 , only two terms contribute to the construction of the spatial wave function , which is a superposition of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "so the calculation of energy reduces to the calculation of the matrix elements of @xmath32 on the states @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if one notes the spatial wave function in the representation of dirac , one will have :    @xmath80    equation ( [ psi00 ] ) shows that the physical state is a mixing of the relative orbital momentum states ( @xmath75,@xmath81 ) and ( @xmath75,@xmath82 ) , with mixing coefficients ( c1 , c2 ) . to calculate the energy of the physical state @xmath83 ,",
    "one starts by evaluating the matrix elements of @xmath32 on the base \\{@xmath84 , @xmath79}. the @xmath85 matrix is not diagonal .",
    "if one notes @xmath86 the kinetic energy and @xmath87 the potential energy , the @xmath88 matrix is written :    @xmath89    it should be noted that by analogy with the work of capstick @xcite , one has @xmath90 @xmath91 , because in the case of the harmonic oscillator @xmath90 and @xmath92 are proportional to the masses @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the case of baryons with the same quark masses .",
    "so one replaces in the function @xmath83 , @xmath90 @xmath95 .",
    "the calculation of the elements @xmath96 is treated in detail in appendix ( [ cake ] ) .",
    "the non - zero elements are the two diagonal elements @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "these elements are thus given according to ( @xmath99 , @xmath100,@xmath101 ) .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements of the potential energy requires to evaluate an integral of dimension six on the potential @xmath38 which contains terms coupled in ( @xmath102 ) and the angle @xmath103 between the two vectors @xmath27 , see fig([jacobi ] ) .     and",
