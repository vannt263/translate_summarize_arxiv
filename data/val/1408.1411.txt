    "the total hall conductivity of the two quasihole bands is hence @xmath332 .",
    "this corresponds to the hall conductivity evaluated in the mott gap .",
    "bulk - edge correspondence implies that edge modes exist in the gap between the two quasihole bands , fig .",
    "[ fig : figexc1 ] .",
    "the quasiparticle bands have @xmath333 , which follows from an analogous calculation .",
    "small finite inverse lifetime @xmath285 results in a shift of quasiparticle poles away from the real axis .",
    "the results of this subsection for @xmath334 remain valid as long as a gap exists between quasiparticle bands .",
    "[ fig : figexc1 ] shows that whenever the inverse lifetime @xmath285 is on the order of the kinetic energy strength @xmath10 , the mott gap and the two gaps between excited bands are smeared off .",
    "it is therefore necessary to require @xmath300 . moreover ,",
    "this allows to resolve intra - gap edge modes from bulk states in the density of states .",
    "the edge modes discussed in this section should be visible either in cold  atom experiments using bragg spectroscopy @xcite and photoemission spectroscopy @xcite or in photonic systems , where the frequency of the incoming - wave can be adjusted . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : nimodel ] , artificial gauge fields have already been synthesized in photonic systems @xcite .",
    "the more challenging requirements are photon  photon interactions .",
    "however , on a single  cavity level it has been shown that photon ",
    "photon interactions can be induced by coupling an off  resonant superconducting qubit to a cavity @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the bosonic haldane  hubbard model at unit filling . by combining several numerical and analytical approaches ,",
    "we have mapped out the phase diagram as a function of two hopping amplitudes and local interaction and found that it consists of two competing types of superfluid and a mott insulator supporting local plaquette currents . in particular",
    ", we found using methods beyond mean - field theory that there is a reentrant transition into the mott insulator .",
    "we have discussed two distinct superfluid ground states .",
    "these are connected either by a first order transition in the weakly interacting regime , or via two second order mott insulator transitions in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "different physical properties of the phases are reflected in the ground state density fluctuations and plaquette currents between next  nearest neighbors .",
    "all these observables are accessible in present  day ultracold atom experiments .",
    "in addition to the study of the ground states , we have addressed the excitation spectra in the weakly interacting superfluid and in the mott domain and found that the corresponding quasiparticle or quasihole excitations consist of bands with non - zero chern numbers which predict the existence of edge states in the gaps between excited bands .",
    "we expect that our findings can be probed in the near future in ongoing experiments .",
    "this work paves the way to open questions about emergent phases at different filling fractions or in multi - component systems , which we will address in future work . for example , related recent studies @xcite of fermions on the half  filled honeycomb lattice have identified emergence of @xmath335-wave superconducting state close to the mott transition .",
    "recent ref .",
    "@xcite discusses a chiral spin superfluid phase of two - component bosons in a double - well potential realized on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this shares some features with our proposal but is nevertheless different .",
