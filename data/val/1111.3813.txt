    "solid state realization of q - bits that do not decohere easily is a challenging task in the field of quantum computation .",
    "topological defects in strongly correlated quantum many body systems are protected from decoherence and have been suggested as q - bit candidates @xcite . in this context , kitaev constructed a remarkable two dimensional quantum spin model that exhibits abelian and non - abelian anyons and is exactly solvable for its spectrum @xcite .",
    "it was later shown that the spin correlation functions are also exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "this model is also extremely interesting form point of view of frustrated spin models and the physics of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) states@xcite .",
    "it realizes , in an exact fashion , the phenomenon of quantum number fractionization and emergent gauge fields that were conjectured and approximately realized in 2d models for rvb states or quantum spin liquids@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the jordan - wigner transformation in this model yields a local fermionic theory@xcite .",
    "this makes the kitaev model an important one that warrants further investigation ; and no wonder that an extensive body of research @xcite has already been carried out exploring its many fascinating aspects .",
    "kitaev showed that the model has a natural formulation in terms of a majorana fermion interacting with z@xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "the remarkable feature of the kitaev model is that the gauge fields turn out to be static .",
    "this greatly simplifies the dynamics leading to the exact computation of the spectrum and spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "the gauge theory of spin-@xmath2 models has a recent history .",
    "it was initially formulated @xcite in the context of strongly correlated electronic systems such as a spin-@xmath2 mott insulator , as a way of implementing the single electron occupancy constraint , @xmath3 this equation is the gauss law constraint for a @xmath4 lattice gauge theory .",
    "it resulted in a strongly interacting u(1 ) gauge theory formalism of spin-@xmath2 models .",
    "soon it was realized that in spin-@xmath2 systems , the @xmath4 gauge invariance always implied an @xmath1 invariance @xcite .",
    "the consequent @xmath1 gauge theory formalism was found to be useful in the context of relating apparently different mean field solutions of the model .",
    "the extended hilbert space of the spin-@xmath2 system is much smaller than that of normal lattice gauge theory where the gauge degrees of freedom on the links are @xmath1 group elements .",
    "consequently , it was shown that the essential physics of the spin-@xmath2 system is captured by a z@xmath0 gauge theory @xcite , where the z@xmath0 gauge group is the center of the original @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "the z@xmath0 gauge theory formalism has been effectively used to bring out the physics of quantum number fractionization in spin-@xmath2 systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow the route charted out above in the context of the kitaev model and show that the z@xmath0 gauge theory can indeed be thought of as the center of the @xmath1 gauge theory of rvb theory .",
    "this sheds light on kitaev s assertion @xcite that the model represents the same universality class of topological order as rvb .",
    "we examine the degeneracy of states in the system defined with periodic boundary conditions in detail .",
    "we show that this degeneracy , which characterises the topological order in the system , arises from the so called large gauge transformations .",
    "namely , gauge field configurations which correspond to the same flux configuration that are not related to each other by local gauge transformations .",
    "these topologically distinct gauge field configurations can be labelled by the value of the wilson loops that wind around the torus in the two different directions .",
    "we find these gauge configurations for the ground state and demonstrate the four - fold degeneracy of the ground state by explicity computing the energies .",
    "further , we generalise this proof to all eigenstates by constructing the operators that generate the large gauge transformations and showing that they do not change the energy of the system in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the @xmath1 gauge symmetry of the model is reviewed in section ( [ su22z2 ] ) where we show that kitaev s choice of the representation of the spin operators in terms of majorana fermions amounts to a @xmath1 gauge fixing procedure which fixes the gauge upto the center z@xmath0 gauge transformations . in section ( [ z2gtkm ] )",
    ", we construct a generalized jordan - wigner transformation and show that it is a z@xmath0 gauge fixing transformation in the kitaev formalism .",
    "we derive the fermionic hamiltonian and simplify the conserved quantities in terms of gauge invariant jordan - wigner operators . in section ( [ gsd ] ) , we explicitly work out the four fold degeneracies of the kitaev model on a torus .",
    "we derive the fermionic spectrum for flux free sector in ( [ gsd1 ] ) and show that it leads to four degenerate ground states in thermodynamic limit . following this in section ( [ tpg ] ) ,",
    "we demonstrate that every eigenstate of the kitaev model has four fold degeneracy . to this end",
    "we derive four mutually anticommuting operators that commute with the hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the minimum dimension of the representation of the 4-dimensional clifford algebra is 4 .",
    "thus we are able to prove that all eigenstates are at least four fold degenerate .",

    "the kitaev model is a spin-@xmath2 system on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 run over the sites of the honeycomb lattice , @xmath7 denotes the nearest neighbor links oriented in the @xmath8th direction as shown in fig .",

    "interacting quantum spin systems often lead to spontaneously broken symmetric states such as a ferro , antiferro or spiral magnetic states . low energy physics of these ordered states are captured by the well known spin wave approximations , reasulting in goldstone mode type bosonic low energy effective theories @xcite .",
    "a quantum spin liquid , on the other hand , has no classical long range order .",
    "experiments in lacuo@xmath38 and other low spin mott insulators , according to anderson , indicated possible presence of neutral fermionic excitations in a quantum spin liquid @xcite . a theory to describe such a quantum spin liquid or resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state needed a paradigm shift from spin wave theory .",
    "it was also clear that a quantum spin liquid , in view of different possible phase coherence among disordered spin configurations , could offer a variety of quantum spin liquid states to be realized in nature .",
    "rvb gauge theory attempted to capture these new possibilties , through an approach involving enlarged hilbert space and emergent gauge fields in strongly correlated electron systems . through the work of wen@xcite and others",
    "it has become clear that there is a plethora of spin liquid phases , characterized by _ quantum order and projective symmetry groups . _",

    "( [ u1cons ] ) is exactly equivalent to the @xmath1 gauss law , @xmath54    before we close this section , we wish to mention that the above gauge theory formalism offers a possible way to understand quantum spin liquid states as and when they exist .",
    "this formalism does not gaurantee a simple gauge theory structure at all energy scales in the physics of the problem .",
    "it only suggests that in some systems ( for some hamiltonians ) at low energy scales there could be emergent gauge fields and interesting consequences of quantum number fractionization , quantum order etc . at high energy scales",
    "gauge fields interact and it is no more simple or useful to talk in terms of emergent gauge fields . as we will see soon , the hamiltonian invented by kitaev on a honeycomb lattice is very special .",
    "it offers static z@xmath0 gauge fields and makes the z@xmath0 gauge theory meaningful at all energy scales .",
    "we can make connection to kitaev s representation of the spins by writing , @xmath55 where @xmath56 are majorana fermions . the single occupancy constraint , eq .",
    "( [ u1cons ] ) reduces to exactly kitaev s form , @xmath57 kitaev s representation of the spins then get written as , @xmath58 note that these three operators are not equal to the gauge invariant spin operators in the extended hilbert space but are exactly equivalent to them in the physical hilbert space . substituting the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ kitsprep ] ) for the spin operators in the hamiltonian is then equivalent to adding gauge fixing terms .",
    "since the @xmath1 gauge generators are invariant under the z@xmath0 center of the gauge group , these terms only fix the gauge upto the central z@xmath0 group represented by @xmath59 .",
    "the hamiltonian will therefore continue to have a z@xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "the simple example of a spin-@xmath2 in a magnetic field illustrates these issues .",
    "if we take the hamiltonian to be @xmath60 then the theory has @xmath1 gauge symmetry , the degenerate ground states in the extended space are @xmath61 for arbitrary @xmath62 . the last two states in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ su2gs ] ) transform as a doublet under the @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "gauge averaging therefore projects out the ground state in the physical subspace , namely @xmath63 .",
    "if the hamiltonian is taken to be , @xmath64 the theory has only z@xmath0 gauge invariance , the degenerate ground state in the extended hilbert space are , @xmath65 the second state in the above equation transforms non - trivially under the z@xmath0 gauge transformation .",
    "thus again , under gauge averaging , the ground state in the physical sector is projected out .",
    "thus kitaev s representation of the spin operators can be interpreted as adding gauge fixing terms to the @xmath1 gauge invariant hamiltonian which leave an unbroken ( unfixed ) z@xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "following kitaev @xcite , we write the hamiltonian in terms of the majorana fermions , @xmath66 where the link variables are defined as @xmath67 .",
    "it is natural to express them in terms of the bond fermions @xcite defined as , @xmath68 the link variables are then given in terms of the occupancy number of the bond fermions , @xmath69 it is easy to see that , @xmath70&=&0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the link variables can be interpreted as static z@xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "it is remarkable that at one shot kitaev hamiltonian has been solved exactly for the entire many body spectrum !",
    "infact , two related phenomena occur : i ) the z@xmath71 gauge theory is exact at all energy scales and ii ) the enlarged hilbert space gets decomposed into sectors that are identical gauge copies having the same energy eigen values ( fig .",
    "[ hlpt1 ] ) .",
    "the hilbert space enlargement does not produce any unphysical state , but only gauge copies . in the standard u(1 ) rvb gauge theory for a heisenberg antiferromagnet , for example , it is easy to see how unphysical states are brought in by hilbert space enlargement .",
    "for example , an unphysical state containing m doubly occupied and m empty sites gives spectrum of a heisenberg antiferromagnet containing 2 m missing sites .",
    "a remarkable feature of the kitaev model is that the jordan - wigner transformation yields a local fermionic hamiltonian @xcite . in this section",
    "we show that the jordan - wigner transformation in the kitaev model can be interpreted as a z@xmath0 gauge fixing procedure resulting in gauge invariant ( gauge fixed ) majorana and bond fermions",
    ". the choice of the jordan wigner path amounts to a choice of the z@xmath0 gauge .",
    "we define the jordan - wigner transformation as follows  @xcite .",
    "take any hamilton path on the lattice defined by a sequence of sites @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the number of sites in the lattice .",
    "the path will classify each bond as normal or tangential as defined in section [ spconsq ] .",
    "the normal bonds will form a dimer covering of the lattice . for a given site ` @xmath12 '",
    "we attach three vectors , two tangential vectors denoted by @xmath74 and one normal vectors @xmath75 , such that they follow eq .",
    "( [ nidef ] ) .",
    "then we can define the jordon - wigner transformations in the following compact way ,      to define the jordan - wigner transformations we associate two majorana fermions ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) at a given site ` @xmath78 ' .",
    "these jordan - wigner ( majorana ) fermions are defined in terms of the gauge invariant spin - operators in the following way , @xmath79 it can be easily checked that the above definitions refer to the usual anti - commutations relations for majorana fermions , @xmath80 since the jordan - wigner fermions are constructed entirely from the spin operators , they are manifestly gauge invariant",
    ". however , it is also interesting to see this by rewriting equations ( [ xidef ] ) and ( [ etadef ] ) in terms of the original majorana fermions and gauge fields , @xmath81    the transformation can be inverted to write the spins in terms of the fermions , @xmath82 these completes the definitions of jordan - wigner fermionisations used in this article .      the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the gauge invariant fermions as , @xmath83 where the gauge fixed z@xmath0 fields , @xmath84 are , @xmath85 @xmath86 is a well known conserved quantity in the one - dimensional applications where it corresponds to the total number of fermions modulo 2 and determines the boundary conditions on the fermions .",
    "thus the jordan - wigner transformation is equivalent to a gauge fixing procedure where all the gauge fields on the tangential bonds ( except one ) are set equal to 1 .",
    "the choice of the hamilton path amounts to a gauge choice since it defines which of the bonds are tangential .",
    "it also defines the sign in the definition of @xmath87 for the normal bonds . in eq .",

    "the appearance of a ` - ' sign in the expression of @xmath189 for choices 2 and 4 can be accounted for by shifting the @xmath193 integral to @xmath194 .",
    "thus it is clear that in thermodynamic limit ground state has four fold degeneracy .      in the preceding section ,",
    "we have shown that four degenerate ground states are characterized by four different topologically distinct gauge field configurations . from the section [ z2gtkm ] , we infer that every flux configuration is characterized by such four topologically distinct gauge field configurations .",

    "though jordan - wigner transformations has been used earlier to solve for kitaev model , our formalism reveals many new features , for example , our definition of j - w transformation is applied to a torus .",
    "we focused on the gauge field contents of the kitaev model and the issue of topological degeneracy .",
    "we showed that ground state is four fold degenerate on the torus _ in both phases_. while it indicates non - trivial topological order , the ground state degeneracy does not distinguish between the gapless and gapped phases .",
    "finally we have shown the equivalence between the fermionised hamiltonian obtained in kitaev gauge and j - w gauge .",
    "lastly we have constructed four mutually anti - commuting operators on a torus to illustrate explicitely the four fold degeneracy for every eigenstate .",
    "our analysis reveals that jordan - wigner analysis can be used even in quantum spin liquid problems , as a general method , to bring out non trivial gauge field content , thereby providing an alternative method in resonating valence bond theories .",
    "as we were completing our manuscript , we learned of a very recent paper by f. j. burnell and chetan nayak ( ref .",

    "then we define complex fermion @xmath262 on each normal internal z - bond in the following way , @xmath263 similarly on each normal slanted y - bond which is joined with a z - link @xmath264 and @xmath265 we define , @xmath266 with this we have alway @xmath267 . at last on each z - link",
