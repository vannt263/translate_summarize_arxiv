    "most of the energy of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) is emitted in the energy band around 30  kev @xcite .",
    "however , the exact nature of the source population responsible for the background at these energies is unknown .",
    "the primary reason is low sensitivity of the previous x - ray telescopes operating above 20 kev .",
    "studies of the high energy sources are also motivated by the recent work at lower energies , 210  kev .",
    "most of the x - ray background at these energies is resolved into sources @xcite but the spectrum of those sources does not match that of the cxb at high energies , indicating the existence of a population of highly obscured sources , which should be detectable more easily above 20  kev ( e.g. , worsley et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .    the telescopes",
    "integral _ provide a major improvement in sensitivity for x - ray imaging above 20  kev @xcite . during its first year , _ integral _ has conducted a number of deep pointings to the galactic center region @xcite and the galactic plane @xcite , as well as to several extragalactic targets .",
    "one of the deepest extragalactic observations was that of the coma cluster region for a total exposure of 500  ksec .",
    "the coma cluster is located very close to the north galactic pole and this field is minimally contaminated by the sources within our galaxy which dominate the hard x - ray sky .",
    "in addition , the image is not `` polluted '' by a bright target and so it is excellent for detection of faint sources .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the analysis of faint serendipitous sources in the coma field .",
    "our image reaches a @xmath8 detection threshold of 1  mcrab in the 2050  kev energy band , above which we detected 12 serendipitous sources . using this sample",
    ", we are able to extend the extragalactic @xmath9 in the hard x - ray band to a flux limit of @xmath1  , a factor of @xmath10 deeper than the extragalactic part of the heao-1 a4 source catalog @xcite .",
    "the coma region was observed by _ integral _ in 2003 on january 2931 ( revolution 36 ) for 170  ksec and on may 1418 ( revolutions 7172 ) for 330  ksec .",
    "the observations consist of 221 shorter pointings which form a @xmath11 grid around the target with a @xmath12 distance between the grid points .",
    "the january and may datasets have different position angles , which leads to larger total sky coverage and helps to minimize the systematic residuals in the final image .",
    "the data quality in both series of observations is similar so they can be combined in a single @xmath13500  ksec dataset .",
    "we used the data from ibis / isgri instrument which is the most suitable for the imaging surveys in the hard x - ray band among the major instrument onboard _",
    "integral_. ibis @xcite is coded - mask aperture telescope .",
    "its cdte - based isgri detector @xcite has a high sensitivity above @xmath14  kev and has a high spatial resolution .",
    "the telescope field of view is @xmath15 ( @xmath16 full coded ) .",
    "all coma pointings cover a @xmath17 region .",
    "the ibis data analysis involves special techniques for coded - mask image reconstruction , for which we used the software suite developed by one of us ( ec ) .",
    "the essential steps are outlined below .",
    "the event energies were calculated following the off - line scientific analysis software v3.0 ( goldwurm et al .",
    "2003 ) using the gain table v9 and the event rise time correction v7 . using the detector images accumulated in a broad energy band , we searched for hot and dead pixels and then screened the data to remove these artifacts .",
    "this resulted in rejection of several percent of the detector area .",
    "we then computed raw detector images for each pointing location and reconstructed the sky images individually .",
    "the reconstruction starts with rebining the raw detector images into a grid with the pixel size equal to 1/3 of the mask pixel size .",
    "this is close but not exactly equal to the detector pixel size .",
    "therefore , the rebining causes a moderate loss of spatial resolution but leads to straightforward application of the standard coded mask reconstruction algorithms ( e.g. , fenimore & cannon 1981 , skinner et al .",
    "basically , the flux for each sky location is calculated as the total flux in the detector pixels which `` see '' the location through the mask , minus the flux in the detector pixels blocked by the mask : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the source flux , @xmath20 is the detector image , @xmath21 or @xmath22 corresponds to transparent or opaque mask pixels , respectively , and @xmath23 is so called balance matrix . the balance matrix accounts for non - uniformity of the detector background . for a given location it is calculated as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the detector image accumulated over large number of observations without strong sources in the field of view ( i.e. , the background ) .",
    "thus the expectation value of @xmath19 is zero for a source - free field ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : conv],[eq : bal ] ) .",
    "the images reconstruction is based on the dld deconvolution procedure ( see notations in fenimore & cannon 1981 ) when the mask pixel corresponds to @xmath26 detector pixels . the original detector is treated as @xmath26 independent detectors and @xmath26 independent sky images are reconstructed and then combined into a single image . the point source in such image",
    "is represented by a @xmath26 square . in our case",
    ", this leads to the effective point spread function ( psf ) being approximately a square of @xmath27 detector pixels or @xmath28 .",
    "periodic structures in the mask produce sky images with a number of prominent peaks accompanying every real source .",
    "an iterative removal procedure was used to eliminate `` ghosts '' associated with the brightest sources ( ngc 4151 , ngc 4388 and coma ) .",
    "no iterative removal of sources was performed for weak sources .",
    "the reconstructed images for each pointing grid location were co - added in the sky coordinates . finally , we computed the statistical uncertainty of flux in the reconstructed image .",
    "this is a straightforward procedure because the noise is poisson in the original data and it can be easily propagated through the image reconstruction algorithm ( i.e. , data rebining and dld deconvolution ) .",
    "we used the 2050  kev energy band for detection of the serendipitous sources in the coma field .",
    "the choice was motivated by the following considerations .",
    "the lower boundary of the energy range where ibis is usefully sensitive is near 20  kev .",
    "the choice of the upper boundary is driven by the desire to extend the energy band to the highest energy possible without sacrificing the sensitivity .",
    "an upper boundary of 50  kev is a reasonable choice because at higher energies , the ibis sensitivity rapidly decreases @xcite .",
    "we checked that at higher energies , there are no sources which are not detected in the 2050  kev band .",
    "the reconstructed image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : img ] .",
    "most of the extragalactic sources are very faint in the hard x - ray band . their detection with",
    "_ integral _ is challenging and requires sensitive techniques .",
    "our approach is based on the so - called matched filtering technique . a similar method applied to the source detection in the _ rosat _ pspc images",
    "is extensively described in vikhlinin et al .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper and present only a brief overview below .",
    "the matched filter source detection is based on the convolution of the original image with the psf .",
    "this method provides the most sensitive detection algorithm for finding faint , isolated sources ( e.g. , pratt 1978 ) . the only difference between the traditional matched filtering and our approach is to slightly modify the filter so that it can provide automatic background subtraction .    the image reconstruction algorithm for coded - aperture imaging implies , in principle , that the background in the reconstructed image is already subtracted ( see eq .  [ eq : conv ] ) .",
    "however , some detector imperfections not fully accounted for by the balance matrix and other practical problems might lead to residual small - amplitude , large - scale intensity variations .",
    "the automatic background subtraction is therefore a desirable property of the detection algorithm .",
    "the solution is to build the detection filter , @xmath29 , from two components .",
    "the positive component in the center matches the psf and provides sensitive detection .",
    "the second one forms a negative `` ring '' at larger radii so that the average value of @xmath29 is zero .",
    "we decided to implement @xmath29 at the difference between the psf and a gaussian of larger width , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ibis psf , and the amplitude satisfies @xmath32    the psf calibration was obtained from the analysis of crab observations .",
    "crab is essentially a point source for _ integral _ ( the source size smaller than @xmath33 or 1 detector pixel ) , therefore its image can be used as a representation of the psf ( we actually used the average of 4 possible reflections of the crab image around the @xmath34- and @xmath35-axis to reduce statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "the derived psf is essentially a square of @xmath27  pixels ( or @xmath28 ) surrounded by fainter larger - scale wings ; its one - dimensional slice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] .    given the psf , the only free parameter in the filter defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : filter],[eq : filter : gauss ] ) is the gaussian width , @xmath36 .",
    "the choice of @xmath36 is driven by two conflicting requirements : a ) the larger values of @xmath36 lead to better signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratios in the convolved images , and b ) smaller values of @xmath36 lead to more accurate subtraction of small - scale background variations .",
    "we chose @xmath37 which results in the signal - to - noise ratio of 99% of its maximum value ( that for @xmath38 ) .    .",
    "the psf is the result of coadding of many real images ( crab nebula ) with different orientations .",
    "the resulting effective psf is then more round and smooth than the ideal psf ( single pointing , no rebinning , perfect detector ) which is a flat 3 by 3 pixels square in the dld sky . ]",
    "the sources are identified as local maxima in the the filter - convolved image .",
    "to sort out statistical fluctuations , we computed the convolved noise as @xmath39 this equation is strictly correct only if the individual image pixels are statistically independent , which is not fulfilled in our case because of rebinning of the detector images (   [ sec : data : reduction ] ) .",
    "however , the effect is small because the correlation length of the noise in the reconstructed images is smaller than the size of the filter .",
    "it can be corrected by uniform rescaling of the noise map given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise : map ] ) so that the _ rms _ variation of the ratio of the convolved image and @xmath40 is 1 .",
    "the required correction factors are @xmath41 .",
    "note that such adjustment effectively corresponds to noise determination directly from the data , which is the most trustworthy approach .",
    "accepted sources are the maxima in the convolved image with the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath42 .",
    "this threshold is lower than what is often used in wide - area surveys .",
    "our choice was motivated by the following considerations .",
    "detection threshold is the result of compromise between our desire to exclude as many false detections as possible ( this drives the threshold high ) while retaining the maximum of real sources in the sample ( this drives it low ) .",
    "the @xmath43 detection threshold results in manageable contamination of the sample by false detections , @xmath44 on average or @xmath45 of the total sample , which still can be reliably subtracted in the final @xmath9 analysis (   [ sec : false : detections ] ) .",
    "source fluxes can be obtained directly from filter - convolved images .",
    "the peak value in the convolved image is proportional to total source flux because convolution with the detection filter is a linear image transformation .",
    "the conversion factor between the peak value and flux was obtained using the reconstructed crab images , for which we assumed the crab spectrum @xmath46  phot  @xmath47  s@xmath48  kev@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the conversion factor is a function of position because of several effects .",
    "first , the psf degradation at large off - axis angles changes the peak value in the filter - convolved images .",
    "second , off - axis psf contains weak side - lobes which leads to over - subtraction of the source flux by a wavelet - like filter with a negative annulus , such as ours .",
    "third , there is s vignetting effect most likely caused by absorption in the mask holes .",
    "these effects were calibrated using a large number of crab observations with the source at different locations within the fov .",
    "these observations were reduced identically to the coma field .",
    "the derived peak - to - flux coefficient decreases by @xmath49 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 off - axis and then stays approximately constant .",
    "we used the conversion factor derived at @xmath51 and ignored the trend at smaller off - axis angles because it affects only a small fraction of the image area .",
    "the source locations were measured as flux - weighted mean coordinates within @xmath52 of the maxima in the filter - convolved images .",
    "the accuracy of this method was tested using a large number of integral observations in which there were sources with @xmath53 .",
    "the distribution of coordinate offsets for these sources is well described by a gaussian with a 68% uncertainty radius of @xmath54 .",
    "the noise in the reconstructed image increases near the edge of the field of view .",
    "this region , if included in the survey , can pollute the source catalog with high - flux false sources .",
    "therefore , we excluded the regions where the _ rms _ level of the image noise is a factor of 10 greater than that in the center of the field of view .",
    "this reduced the image area by 28% .",
