    "quantized vortices appeared in quantum fluids and other systems play a fundamental role in the properties of the latter .",
    "for that reason they have been an object of intensive study for many years ( for review and bibliography see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the greatest success in investigations of dynamics of quantized vortices has been achieved in relatively simple cases such as a vortex array in rotating helium or vortex rings .",
    "however these simple cases are rather exception than a rule . due to extremely involved dynamics initially straight lines or rings",
    "evolve to form highly chaotic structure , so called vortex tangle ( see e.g. papers @xcite , @xcite and review @xcite ) .",
    "the vortex tangle consists of a set of vortex loops of different lengths .",
    "the individual vortex loops evolves obeying the biot - savart law , undergoing the friction force and the applied external velocity field .",
    "all these processes are good understood , although the according equations of motion are highly nonlinear ( and nonlocal ) therefore general analysis can be made with use of numerical methods .",
    "besides motion of each of the individual loops there is one more element of general evolution of the vortex tangle related to collision of loops , or intersection of elements of vortex lines . during intersection of lines the very complicated process , related to arrangement of the vortex core takes place @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this process is relatively short , therefore it is usually accepted that the filaments instantly reconnect whenever they intersect each other .",
    "it is widely appreciated that the reconnection processes influence both the structure and evolution of vortex tangle .",
    "however the questions how it happens and what mechanisms are responsible for these remain open .",
    "for instance , feynman in his pioneering paper devoted to superfluid turbulence proposed scenario how the vortex tangle decays in absence of applied external counterflow .",
    "according to this scenario a fusion of small vortex rings into larger ones as well as a breakdown into smaller ones is possible at the moments of the reconnection events ( see fig .  [ feynman ] ) .        in assumption that _  on the average _ the last property dominates i.e. the cascade like process of formation of smaller and smaller loops forms .",
    "when the scale of the small rings becomes of the order of the interatomic distances , which is the final stage of the cascade , the vortex motion is degenerated into thermal excitations .",
    "this key idea that degeneration of the vortex tangle occurs due to cascade - like transferring of the length in space of scale of sizes of vortex loops was indirectly confirmed only in numerical calculations , where the procedure of artificial elimination of small loops had been used @xcite-@xcite . in spite of the recognized importance of the reconnecting loops kinetics , the numerical results remain main source of information about this process .",
    "the obvious lack of theoretical investigations interferes with deep insight in the nature of this phenomena ( this question had been recently discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "for instance it is not clear how the cascade of length in space of vortex loops sizes is formed , what mechanisms are responsible for this , what quantities determine an intensity of cascade , and why at all breakdown of the loop prevails .    of course the scarcity of analytic investigations related to incredible complexity of the problem .",
    "indeed we have to deal the set of objects with not fixed number of elements , they can born and die .",
    "thus , some analog of the secondary quantization method is required with the difference that objects ( vortex loops ) themselves possess an infinite number of degree of freedom with very involved dynamics .",
    "clearly this problem can hardly be resolved in nearest future . recently in @xcite much more modest approach , based on the  rate equation  for distribution function @xmath13 was elaborated in context of cosmic strings . following this work we introduce distribution function @xmath14 of density of loop in",
    " space  of their lengths .",
    "it is defined as a number of loops ( per unit of volume ) with lengths between @xmath7 and @xmath15 . due to",
    "reconnection processes @xmath14 can vary .     and",
    "@xmath16.,width=302 ]    we discriminate two types of processes , namely the fusion of two loops into the larger single loop and the breakdown of single loop into two daughter loops .",
    "the kinetic of vortex tangle is affected by the intensity of the introduced processes .",
    "the intensity of the first process is characterized by the rate of collision @xmath17 of two loops with lengths @xmath3and @xmath4 and forming the loop of length @xmath5 .",
    "the intensity of the second process is characterized by the rate of self - intersection @xmath16 of loop of the length @xmath7 into two daughter loops with lengths @xmath8 and @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ a_b_loops ] ) . in view of exposed above",
    "we can directly write out the master  kinetic ",
    "equation for rate of change distribution function @xmath14 . @xmath18",
    "all of the processes are depicted at the left of each line .",
    "clear that the  kinetic ",
    "equation has  bookkeeping  character .",
    "physics of this approach lies in the  correct  determinations of coefficient of that equations @xmath17 and @xmath16 on the base of some more or less plausible model . in the present work we derive some",
    "general ( independent on the model ) relations for reconnection rates @xmath0 and @xmath19 ( section ii ) . then in sec .",
    "iii we apply these relations to evaluate the reconnection rates on the base of gaussian model of the vortex tangle elaborated earlier @xcite .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusion and plans for future investigations .",
    "in this section we will formulate mathematical definition for quantities @xmath21 and@xmath22@xmath16 .",
    "we will start with the latter quantity @xmath23 by definition its physical meaning is just frequency of events when part of line with total length @xmath24 intersects the same line to create two two daughter loops with lengths @xmath25 and @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ a_b_loops ] ) , that is self - crossing event .",
    "as it is already stated we assume that each crossing event leads to reconnection of lines .",
    "the elements of vortex line are described as a function @xmath26  ( see fig .",
    "[ intersection ] ) that is time dependant radius - vector of the points resting on loop .",
    "variable @xmath27 labels the points of the loop .",
    "it is convenient to choose variable @xmath27 to be equal to the arc length , @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider function @xmath29 that is just @xmath30 vector connecting points @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "clearly that condition @xmath33 implies that the self - crossing event of parts of line with label - coordinates @xmath34 occurs at moment of time @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is fluctuating 3-component function of three arguments @xmath36 .",
    "we are interested in how often @xmath35 vanishes in cube of space @xmath37 .",
    "points in space @xmath38 where function @xmath35 vanishes , are points of cross of @xmath39 surfaces @xmath40 in space @xmath37 as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ 3_sufaces ] .    , where the label variable @xmath41 is taken here as the arc length .",
    "we associate the moment of intersection with the vanishing of vector @xmath42 connecting points @xmath43 and @xmath44 .  , width=226 ]    . in space of its variables",
    "@xmath45 these points are cross of @xmath39 surfaces @xmath46.,width=264 ]    from theory of generalized function it follows that number of these points ( we denote them below as @xmath47 ) can be expressed via @xmath48-function of quantity @xmath49 with the help of following formula .",
    "@xmath50 here @xmath51 are the components of vector @xmath52 . by integration of both parts of ( [ s_zeroes_number ] ) over @xmath53",
    "we would obtain the full number of intersections ( per unit time ) .",
    "if , further to introduces additional constraint @xmath54implying that the distance ( along line ) between chosen points is equal to @xmath7 and to integrate over @xmath55 , we obtain the rate of self - intersection of line with length @xmath7 and breakdown it into pieces @xmath3 and @xmath56 .",
    "in addition we have to do averaging  over all possible fluctuating configurations .",
    "thus the coefficient @xmath57 with dimension @xmath58 = s^{-1}cm^{-1}$ ] is equal to @xmath59    to obtain coefficient @xmath0 we use the similar procedure .",
    "let us consider two loops with length @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our purpose now to find the rate @xmath0 of fusion of these two loops into one loop of length @xmath60 .",
    "dimension of @xmath0 is @xmath61=cm^{3}s^{-1}$ ] .",
    "as previously we describe vortex filaments by positions of radius vectors their elements @xmath62 and @xmath63 . here",
    "we have two label variables @xmath64 belonging to different loops and running in limits @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "one more important difference with the previous case is that both functions @xmath62 and @xmath67 should depend on  initial  positions @xmath68 and @xmath69 , chosen arbitrary .",
    "of course in previous case of self - intersection of single loop , quantity @xmath70 also depended on  initial ",
    "positions @xmath71 , but it did not influence the rate of self - intersection . now for case of the fusion this dependance is important , since very distant loops have small probability to collide . let us introduce the  fusion  functions @xmath72 repeating the considerations for case of the single loop we find that number of reconnection ( per unit of time ) of points @xmath73 formally coincides with ( [ s_zeroes_number])@xmath74 with the difference that @xmath73 belong to different curves . since intersections of any elements of lines lead to fusion of the loops we have to integrate ( [ m_zeroes_number ] ) over @xmath55 .",
    "the result obtained is valid for chosen pair of loops . to obtain the total number of events we have to multiply the result obtained by quantity @xmath75 , which is just a full number of loops of chosen sizes in the whole volume .",
    "comparing with the master kinetic equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) we find the final expression for fusion coefficient @xmath17    @xmath76    thus we obtained expressions ( [ b_def])and ( [ a_def ] ) , which allow to calculate the rates of reconnections of the fusion and breakdown vortex loops .",
    "they are however just formal mathematical identities .",
    "concrete results depend on statistics of individual lines .",
    "therefore to move further we have to ascertain the procedure for averaging .",
    "it will be done in the next section .",
    "to evaluate quantities @xmath77 and @xmath0 written in form ( [ b_def ] ) and ( [ a_def ] ) one needs to know statistics of individual loops . in general case this statistics should be extracted from investigation of the full dynamical problem .",
    "the according statement of such problem includes equation of motion ( biot - savart law for quantum vortices ) , dissipative effects ( interaction with normal component ) and additional langevin force responsible for chaotic behavior .",
    "the problem becomes more involved by circumstance that other loops also influence dynamics of the chosen loop . at this stage",
    "we choose another way , namely we use the gaussian model of the vortex tangle elaborated by author @xcite . to develop this approach",
    "the trial distribution functional of gaussian form had been consructed .",
    "this functional absorbed all properties of the superfluid turbulence known from both experimental studies and numerical simulations . according to this model the  average  vortex loop has a typical structure shown in fig .",
    "[ rw ] .",
    "parts of the line are separated in @xmath30 space by distance @xmath78 the distant parts @xmath79 are separated in @xmath30 space by the distance @xmath80 , i.e. the vortex loop has the typical random walking structure . , width=264 ]    the close parts of the loop separated ( along line ) by distance @xmath81 smaller then the mean radius of curvature @xmath82 are strongly correlated , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is the tangent vector ) and line is smooth .",
    "remote parts of the line @xmath85 are not correlated at all , @xmath86 .",
    "thus for large separations the vortex loop has a typical  random walking structure  with the wiener distribution",
    ". this  semifractal ",
    "behavior satisfies to the generalized  wiener distribution .",
    "namely , the probability @xmath87to find some particular configuration @xmath88 is expressed by the probability distribution functional ( see for details in @xcite ) @xmath89 here @xmath90 is normalizing factor , @xmath7 is the length of curve , it is supposed to be much larger then mean radius of curvature @xmath91 .",
    "the probability distribution functional ( [ gauss_model ] ) introduced in @xcite distribution considered anisotropy and  polarization of vortex tangle in counterflowing turbulent helium .",
    "this fact is reflected by the circumstance that @xmath92 is the full matrix . in practice",
    "it is more convenient to deal with characteristic functional @xmath93 defined as @xmath94 the characteristic functional enables us calculate any averages depending on vortex lines configuration @xmath88 by simple functional differentiation .",
    "for instance the average tangent vector @xmath95 or the correlation function between orientation of the different elements of the vortex filaments @xmath96 are readily expressed via characteristic functional accordingly to the following rules :    @xmath97    calculation of the characteristic functional @xmath98 ( [ cf_def ] ) on the base of the probability functional ( [ gauss_model ] ) is reduced to functional integration , which , in turn , reduces to the  full square procedure  .",
    "the result is    @xmath99    to avoid unnecessary lengthy calculations we simplify the model expressed by the probability distribution functional ( [ gauss_model ] ) , namely we omit both the anisotropy and polarization . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath100 used in ( @xcite ) can be taken as @xmath101 -\\frac{2\\xi _ { 0}\\sqrt{\\pi } } { l}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{n_isotrop}\\ ] ] for small separation @xmath102 , @xmath103  that guarantees that @xmath104 as it should be for smooth lines ( we recall that for pure random walking  line the quantity @xmath105 does not exist at all ) . for large separation @xmath106 exponents tends to @xmath107 and correlation between tangent vectors weakens ,  @xmath108  the second term in parenthesis of expression ( [ n_isotrop ] ) appears due to closeness of the loops .",
    "it ensures that @xmath109 as it should be for the closed lines ( see explanations in ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "thus the characteristic functional with function @xmath110 satisfies to necessary  semifractal  behavior of line  and will be used further for evaluation of the rate reconnection coefficients . here",
    "it is necessary to do two important comments .",
    "first one concerns the  semifractal  structure of the vortex loop . in principle",
    ", reconnections events occur due random walking behavior with non - zero probability of the meeting of any two elements . however , to evaluate the according rates on base of relations ( [ b_def ] ) , ( [ a_def ] ) , we need to know not only an average of @xmath111 but also an average of the jacobian .",
    "but the latter includes averaged derivatives ( with respect two both label variable@xmath73 and time ) .",
    "it is known fact however that quantities like @xmath112 etc .",
    "are ill - defined for pure random walking structure , for that reason we need to smooth away the curve on small scales .",
    "the second remark concerns the mean radius of curvature @xmath91 .",
    "this quantity  appears here as important parameter of theory of random walk .",
    "it is frequently called as  an elementary step  or persistence length . in fact",
    "the theory described by the wiener distribution is failed for small scales less then @xmath91 , therefore usually this value appears as a low cut - off of the whole approach .",
    "let us come back to the rate coefficients .",
    "we start with the self - intersection processes .",
    "positions of line elements @xmath114 and relative vector @xmath115 are strongly fluctuating quantities having the gaussian statistics . due to the wick theorem  the average in integrand of ( [ b_def ] )  can be taken as a sum of all possible pairs of quantity @xmath116and its derivatives .",
    "because of uniformity in @xmath27 space , quantity @xmath117  depends on @xmath118 for that reason all averages of structure @xmath119 vanish , therefore only pairs separately from @xmath117 and from its derivatives survive . as a result",
    "the average of production is equal to production of  averages and each of the factors can be evaluated separately @xmath120 as mentioned , the use of the characteristics functional ( [ cf_def ] ) , ( [ cf_n ] ) allows to calculate any averaged functional of configurations @xmath121 let us show how to evaluate @xmath122 . with use of the standard integral representation for @xmath123-function @xmath124 we rewrite @xmath125 as @xmath126 \\right\\rangle d^{3}% \\mathbf{y= }   \\notag",

    "relation ( [ teta ] ) implies that we choose in integrand of the characteristic functional only points lying in interval from @xmath131 to @xmath10 on  the curve . substituting this value @xmath132 expressed by ( [ teta ] ) in cf ( [ cf_n ] ) with function  @xmath133 in form ( [ n_isotrop ] ) we obtain @xmath134 d^{3}\\mathbf{y=}\\left ( \\frac{3}{2\\pi ^{3/4}\\xi _ { 0}\\left ( ( \\xi _ { 2}-\\xi _ { 1})-(\\xi _ { 2}-\\xi _ { 1})^{2}/l\\right ) } \\right ) ^{3/2 }   \\label{delta_self}\\ ] ] evaluation of absolute value of jacobian in ( [ self_separate ] ) we perform by use of @xmath135",
    "furthermore it would be convenient for the sake of generalization to use vector velocity @xmath136 instead of calculation of it in explicit form , expressing velocity via the vortex filament configuration @xmath137 calculation of @xmath138 can be fulfilled writing  jacobian in explicit form and subsequent applying the wick theorem .",
    "simple but tedious calculations leads to result that @xmath139 where @xmath140 all permutations with respect to @xmath141 .  estimating @xmath142 and similar terms as @xmath143 we obtain that @xmath144  after use of the integration @xmath145  ( see [ b_def ] ) we finally obtain @xmath146 where constant @xmath147 we introduced in coefficient @xmath148 the additional factor @xmath149 in order to avoid the over - counting of the reconnection events , since decays @xmath150 and @xmath151 describe the same process , though the both enter into equations .",
    "let us recall that the quantity @xmath91 is the mean radius of curvature .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath152 is the result of particular approximation used in paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "if for instance we used pure wiener distribution  with the persistency length @xmath153 and disregard the closeness of line , we would have for coefficient",
    "@xmath57 the expression @xmath154 where @xmath155 this result is very similar to result obtained earlier in paper @xcite from the qualitative consideration . yet it is important also that in this way it is not clear how to relate the persistency length @xmath153 with the mean radius of curvature .",
    "let us now evaluate quantity @xmath0 defined by relation ( [ a_def ] ) .",
    "we again ( as for the previous case ) evaluate average from jacobian and @xmath123-function separately .",
    "contribution from jacobian coincides with the previous result@xmath156 .",
    "the rest @xmath123-function part can be evaluated with the help of the cf obtained above . unlike previous case we have to know two - loop distribution function .",
    "since we omit interaction of loops ( until the reconnection event occurs ) the cf  for two loops with lengths @xmath3and @xmath157 is just production of the expressions of type ( [ cf_n ] )    @xmath158    quantities @xmath159 and @xmath160 differ from each other only by lengths of loops @xmath25and @xmath157 , entering expressions for @xmath161 .",

    "thus we obtain the remarkable result , that for noninteracting loops quantity @xmath0  responsible for merging of loops does not depend on statistics of individual loop at all and is equal @xmath175 here @xmath176 as earlier we introduced additional factor @xmath149 to avoid the over - counting of the reconnection events",

    "this fact confirms the validity of approach made in our work , which allows to use it for more complicated ( in comparison with random walk ) cases .",
