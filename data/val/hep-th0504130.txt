    "it is interesting to notice that  @xcite , in the asymptotic limit at large distances , the local geometry of the background of salam - sezgin vacuum approaches the ns5-brane near - horizon geometry  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a difference in that string coupling constant goes to zero in the asymptotic limit of the background , while it blows up in the throat region of the ns5-brane . in this limit , it is valid to study non - bps d - branes in terms of dbi type effective theory .",

    "since the background fields are obviously invariant under the transformation , the solution indeed describes the same object as in the previous section embedded in a different direction in s@xmath11 ( in the limit @xmath102 ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the dbi type effective action of a non - bps d5-brane in the asymptotic limit of the ten - dimensional lift of the salam - sezgin vacuum . in the limit the background approaches r@xmath159t@xmath47s@xmath11 and exact tachyon kink solutions were found for the d5-brane on @xmath160 .",
