    "the angular distribution of galaxies has been of recent interest with increased data from large surveys and the possibility of these data to relate the orientations of galaxies to their halos in a statistical way ( e.g. , sales & lambas 2004 ; brainerd 2004 ; azzaro et al .",

    "they showed that the conclusions of k05 were incorrect for two reasons : first , the statistical analysis of k05 was not valid for small samples , such as the @xmath5 observed mw satellites , and for such samples the statistic they used is non - discriminatory ; second , k05 incorrectly assumed that the null hypothesis for cdm should be an isotropic satellite distribution .     from the major axis of the host halo mass distribution as a function of @xmath6 .",

    "this is shown explicitly in the left panel of figure  [ f1 ] for a sample of @xmath7 simulated approximately mw - sized , cdm halos ( see z05 for details ) .",
    "the angle between the major axis of the primary halo and the position of the subhalo is @xmath10 and an isotropic distribution is uniform in the variable @xmath11 .",
    "the principal axes of the host halo were computed using only particles within @xmath12 of the halo virial radius , to focus on the region where the central galaxy resides .",
    "the satellites were selected to have maximum circular velocities @xmath8 , where @xmath13 is that of the host halo .",
    "these satellites are roughly the size required to host the observed mw dwarf satellites ( e.g. , kravtsov et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov probability of selecting the simulated subhalo sample from an isotropic distribution is @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , z05 demonstrated that planar distributions of subhalos , similar to that of the mw satellites , are not unlikely due largely to accretion along preferred directions .",
    "such planes are typically aligned with the major axis of the primary halo .",
    "thus , the mw satellites are consistent with cdm predictions , provided that the pole of the mw is aligned with the major axis of the surrounding halo .",
    "the metal - poor globular clusters surrounding the mw and the satellites of m31 show evidence of a similar alignment and new techniques may yield constraints on the orientation of the mw halo ( e.g. , gnedin et al .",
    "however , such alignments present a challenge for simple scenarios of disk galaxy formation because the angular momenta of dm halos tend to be perpendicular to halo major axes .",
    "the results of z05 , kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and l05 are all based on dissipationless @xmath15-body simulations ; however , one of the effects of baryonic dissipation is to make dm halos more spherical than their counterparts in dissipationless simulations ( e.g. , kazantzidis et al .",
    "one may inquire whether the alignment of satellites along the principal axes of host halos is as prevalent in dissipational simulations .",
    "one might expect differences between dissipational and dissipationless simulations to be small in this regard because both the major axis and the positions of satellites reflect the directions of recent accretion along filaments and because subhalos are biased toward large halo - centric distances compared to dm ( @xmath16 ) , where the change in shape is small .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ f1 ] is an explicit demonstration that dissipational processes do not significantly alter the alignment of halo and satellites .",
    "the figure shows an analysis of the eight cluster halos of kazantzidis et al .",

    ", width=415 ]    it is interesting to quantify the relationship between the spatial distributions of the smooth , dm components of host halos and the subhalos that reside within them .",
    "do the subhalos simply follow the triaxial mass distribution ?",
    "there are several potential ways to address this issue , such as computing angular correlations etc . , and i discuss two intriguing quantifications in this section . one way to address the relationship of subhalos and dm is through the ratios of the principal axes of inertia denoted @xmath19 . for subhalos ,",
    "the inertia tensor can be computed in two ways . in the first ,",
    "each subhalo is counted equally and in the second method , each subhalo can be counted in proportion to its bound mass .",
    "the result is a `` number - weighted '' inertia tensor and a `` mass - weighted '' inertia tensor .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows a comparison between the axis ratios of host dm halos using , computed as specified above , and the mass- and number - weighted axis ratios of their subhalo populations .",
    "the sample consists of @xmath20 hosts with @xmath21 and their subhalos simulated with the art code ( kravtsov et al .",
    "the particle mass is @xmath22 , the spatial resolution is @xmath23 , and each host contains @xmath24 particles within its virial radius .    the number - weighted axis ratios in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] show that the full number - weighted satellite populations broadly trace the dm distributions of their host halos .",
    "however , notice that the mass - weighted axis ratios are systematically smaller than that of the dm in the host halo .",
    "more massive subhalos are more strongly biased toward a flattened distribution than small subhalos , a result consistent with the studies of z05 , l05 , and a05 .",
    "the robustness of this result has been checked by randomly re - assigning the weights ( masses in this case ) among the subhalo populations .",
    "the axis ratios based on these randomized weights are generally similar to the number - weighted axis ratios shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "this angular bias for large subhalos is not entirely surprising .",
    "the smallest subhalos have generally been accreted over an extended period of time and interact gravitationally as dm particles , adopting a self - consistent configuration with the host potential .",
    "the largest subhalos have typically been accreted more recently so they more faithfully reflect the directions of recent infall , and they tend to be more strongly biased to form in overdense filaments .    as a second comparison between substructure and smooth mass ,",
    "consider the 2d projected fraction of mass in substructure , @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity is constrained by measurements of flux ratio anomalies in multiply - imaged quasar systems ( e.g. , dalal & kochanek 2002 ) , and can be used as a probe of cosmological parameters that influence the growth of small - scale structure .",
    "zentner & bullock ( 2003 ) and mao et al . (",
