    "equilibrium crystal shapes typically consist of various flat facets connected by rounded surfaces .",
    "the way this structure changes with temperature has been studied for many years  @xcite .",
    "most aspects are well established .",
    "for example , rounded parts are associated with crystal orientations where the surface is rough , and flat facets can disappear from the equilibrium shape at the roughening temperature of those specific facets .",
    "roughening transitions belong to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "many details follow from the scaling properties of the kt transition , e.g. , that the facet diameter vanishes exponentially with reduced temperature , and that the curvature of the surface is universal just above the kt transition at that facet orientation .",
    "flat facets typically connect smoothly to rounded , rough surface areas .",
    "the surface orientation in the rounded part varies continuously and connects without a jump in angle onto the flat facet .",
    "such phase boundaries are described by pokrovsky - talapov ( pt ) transitions  @xcite .",
    "the angle difference vanishes with a @xmath2 power .",
    "the most salient feature of pt transitions is their anisotropic scaling .",
    "the rounded surface on the rough side of the pt transition can be interpreted as a stepped surface from the perspective of the flat facet .",
    "the characteristic lengths along , @xmath3 , and perpendicular to these steps , @xmath4 , scale as @xmath5 , with @xmath1 .",
    "two dimensional equilibrium statistical mechanical systems are mathematically equivalent to one dimensional quantum systems at zero temperature .",
    "the transfer matrix formalism of the first is the path integral representation of the second .",
    "pt transitions are equivalent to metal - insulator transitions in one dimensional fermion systems .",
    "the steps represent the world lines of fermions , and the lattice direction parallel to the steps plays the role of time . in the rough phase ( the metal phase )",
    "the fermions behave relativistically , i.e. , time , @xmath3 , scales compared to space , @xmath4 , with dynamic exponent @xmath6 , @xmath7 . at the pt metal - insulator transition",
    "the fermions behave non - relativistically , with dynamic exponent @xmath1 instead of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the rough - to - facet interface can also be first - order , with a discontinuity in the surface orientation angle instead of the pt - type smooth connection .",
    "the critical endpoint between such first - order and pt - type segments provides an example of a quantum field theory with dynamic exponent @xmath0 . to our knowledge",
    "an explicit example of such a pt critical endpoint ( pte ) has not been reported before .",
    "we will do so in this paper .",
    "our current interest in these issues stems from the discovery that the scaling properties at facet ridge endpoints ( fre ) are related to kpz - type growth  @xcite .",
    "fre points are the endpoints of ridges where two facets connect directly .",
    "the ridge splits into two pt or two first - order transitions with a rounded , rough surface in between .",
    "the exactly soluble body - centered solid - on - solid ( bcsos ) model on a square lattice ( with only next nearest neighbour interactions ) contains such a fre point  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the transfer matrix of this model becomes stochastic at the fre point and maps exactly onto the master equation time evolution operator for the so - called brick model in one dimension lower  @xcite .",
    "the latter describes a growing 1d crystal .",
    "the 1d growing interface is rough , and its scaling properties belong to the kpz universality class .",
    "the @xmath8-direction represents the spatial direction and the @xmath9-direction represents time , just as in mapping of the pt transtion to 1d fermions mentioned above .",
    "the dynamic exponent is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the characteristic time needed to reach the stationary growing state diverges as @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the size of the 1d lattice .",
    "this translates into non - trivial scaling properties of kpz - type fre points  @xcite .",
    "when approached from the rounded phase in the direction parallel to the facet ridge , see fig .",
    "[ 6vertex ] , the surface orientation jumps",
    ". moreover , at the rough side the characteristic length scale in the direction along the facet ridge , @xmath3 , scales as @xmath5 with @xmath10 .",
    "this exact mathematical mapping between the scaling properties of equilibrium phase transitions to those of dynamic non - equilibrium transitions in one lower dimension is intriguing .",
    "but it leaves us with an important question .",
    "the above bcsos model satisfies a special symmetry at its fre point .",
    "the transfer matrix is  accidentally \" stochastic .",
    "it has full rotational symmetry in the spin-@xmath13 operators ( the step variables ) .",
    "this implies , e.g. , a complete degeneracy of the free energy with respect to all surface orientations .",
    "such a symmetry is too special .",
    "fre points are a more general phenomenon , not limited to kpz - type stochastic transfer matrices .",
    "we need to investigate whether the kpz - type scaling exponent @xmath10 is generic .",
    "maybe stochasticity is restored at large length scales , asymptotically close to the fre point , with non - stochasticity an irrelevant operator .",
    "more likely , the fre point changes its character . in this paper",
    "we present such an investigation , a numerical study of a model with a complex crystal shape .",
    "we define this model in section 2 .",
    "it originates from our earlier study of possible spontaneous low - angle faceting in fcc(111)-type facets  @xcite .",
    "this model has the required property that its crystal shape is complex and that accidental symmetries are unlikely .",
    "section 3 contains an overview of the phase diagram and crystal shapes . in section 4",
    "we describe our numerical method .",
    "the crystal structure is actually much richer than we anticipated .",
    "entire facets vanish as functions of the coupling constants .",
    "fre points become triple points .",
    "we also find a more exotic feature , like a first - order ( for ) line inside the rough phase emerging from the fre point ( section 5 ) . at this line the surface orientation angle inside the rough phase jumps . in their paper about the exact solution of the fre point in the square lattice bcsos model , bukman and shore  @xcite speculate about the possible generalizations of fig .",
    "[ 6vertex ] .",
    "the for line structure corresponds to their so - called ridge scenario .",
    "however , they doubted that it would be realized . in our model , for lines",
    "are clearly present although they remain very short .    in a nearby section of the phase diagram , the for lines disappear .",
    "the rough - to - faceted ridge becomes sharp with a jump in the surface orientation angle .",
    "these first - order lines terminate further away from the fre point in pte points and the edge continues as a second order pt line . in section 6",
    "we study the scaling properties at these pte points .",
    "they display anisotropic scaling with exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 7 .",
    "our model emerges naturally at a coarse grained level in a study of spontaneous low angle faceting in fcc(111 ) facets .",

    "it is more appropriate to introduce the model from a different perspective .",

    "we break the symmetry between the @xmath15- and @xmath17-type columns , such that two distinct ( 001 ) facets can be cut from this crystal , those with @xmath15 s or those with @xmath17 s on top . @xmath15 and @xmath17 could be different type of molecules , but that is not what we have in mind . the interactions between the next nearest neighbour columns , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , would then be different . instead",

    "we can model this by adding a nearest neighbour coupling in the bcsos model @xmath23 where , in the sum over nearest neighbors , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) always refers to @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) sublattice .",

    "the surface molecules rotate due to surface relaxation .",
    "typically they do so differently with the @xmath15 s or the @xmath17 s on top .",

    "these first - order segments connect at pte critical endpoints to conventional pt - type segments where the rough phase connects to the facet without a jump in orientation .",

    "the main object of this study is to establish how general and universal the kpz scaling properties of the fre point in the square lattice bcsos model are .",
    "our conclusion is that the stochastic nature of their transfer matrix makes kpz - type fre points special and unstable . in general the local crystal shape around fre points",
    "is more complex than simply one facet ridge splitting into two pt lines .",
    "instead there are for lines sticking into the rough phase and/or the rough - facet phase boundaries become first - order . even more complex structures (",
