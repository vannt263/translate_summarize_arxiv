    "seventy years ago , kramers  @xcite proposed an equation for the thermal escape of a brownian particle out of a metastable well .",
    "this problem is considered an issue of fundamental interest and it has received great attention from an impressive number of scientific areas  @xcite .",
    "we present here a minor contribution to this vast field : a detailed numerical study , by using langevin dynamics simulations , of the activation problem in the moderate - to - high and high damping regime of the system .",
    "this work is motivated by a recent numerical study of the kramers problem at low damping  @xcite . there , important finite barrier effects were described , a very slow convergence to the infinite barrier limit of the system was reported and the accuracy of the drozdov - hayashi ( dh ) theory  @xcite was proved . as it is shown there , an accurate theory is of fundamental interest to understand experiments in this physical regime .    on the other side of the same coin , the high damping limit of the problem is found .",
    "this is the typical case for many of the current friction  @xcite and biological - physics works  @xcite , where escape rate is the fundamental concept to understand force spectroscopy experiments . in many of these",
    "works the kramers result for the escape rate at high damping : @xmath1 appears as the theoretical starting point to understand experimental results .    in his famous work@xcite",
    ", kramers also derived an expression for the escape rate in the moderate to high damping limit , @xmath2 where the damping dependent prefactor is given by @xmath3^{1/2}-(\\gamma/2\\omega_b)$ ] .",
    "there , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related with the potential curvature at the well and the barrier respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] , @xmath6 stands for the potential barrier and @xmath7 for the damping of the system . for high damping , @xmath8",
    ", we have @xmath9 for the prefactor and we recover the extensively used result of eq .",
    "( [ kramers_hd ] ) .",
    "the given results were obtained for a parabolic barrier  @xcite in the so - called infinite barrier regime of the system , where @xmath10 .",
    "another important concept in thermal activation theory is the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) .",
    "this is defined as the mean time @xmath11 for particles injected with zero velocity at point @xmath12 , to reach a point @xmath13 , where they are absorbed . in the overdamped limit ,",
    "given the potential @xmath14 , the mfpt can be exactly computed as  @xcite @xmath15    there exist an important literature studying the relation between transition rates and mean first passage times  @xcite",
    ". it has been usually assumed , and theoretically proved , that there is a close relation between both quantities and in fact @xmath16 whenever the injection and adsorbing points correspond to two potential minima separated by a barrier .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ mfpt ] ) and ( [ r_t ] ) allow for computing the exact escape rate in the overdamped limit of the system and for comparing to the kramers infinite barrier and other escape rate results in this physical regime .",
    "we devote section ii of the paper to this end where a critical review of existing theories is presented .",
    "there , we propose a relatively simple equation , eq .  ( [ rmhd ] ) , to compute the escape rate for any barrier and damping in the moderate - to - high and high damping domains .",
    "then , in section iii we study the time to reach the barrier problem .",
    "this time , @xmath17 , differs from the previously calculated @xmath11 by a factor that changes from 1 to 1/2 when damping increases , and it is the relevant quantity in some situations .",
    "armed with our previous results , we attack in section iv the so - called _ force spectroscopy _ problems .",
    "there , the system is continuously biased by an external field and the escape field probability distribution function is recorded .",
    "we compare results for the mean escape field based in different theories .",
    "we stress the differences between results for field to reach the next metastable state and field to reach the barrier .",
    "we also show that damping times field ramp is the relevant parameter in the overdamped limit , and that there exists a value of this parameter beyond which important nonequilibrium effects dominate the problem .",
    "we finish by showing results in the full damping spectrum .",
    "we use langevin dynamics simulations to compute the mean time for a particle with a given initial condition to reach a defined point beyond the barrier . to be precise",
    ", we will be first interested in computing the mean time for a particle sited with zero velocity in the minimum of a metastable well @xmath18 to reach for first time the next available potential minimum @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] . for us",
    "this will be the definition of the relevant mean first passage time ( mfpt ) @xmath11 of the problem .    to be definite we study the dynamics of a brownian particle in a metastable potential : @xmath20 where for the potential we use @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the stochastic force describing the thermal fluctuations .",
    "here we consider white thermal noise , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the tilted sinusoidal potential describes a particle in a periodic potential subjected to an external field , a situation of interest in many fields .",
    "in particular , eq .  ( [ langevin ] ) is experimentally realized by a biased josephson junction , and the high damping regime can be addressed with resistively shunted tunnel junctions or with superconducting - normal - superconducting ones@xcite .",
    "we compute the escape rate of a particle out of the metastable well ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] ) as a function of the damping of the system and for different values of the @xmath25 ratio , which is the most relevant parameter of the problem .",
    "some authors , using different approaches , have addressed the problem of including finite barrier effects in the theory  @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting issue since in many cases escape occurs at relatively small barriers . in our model system ,",
    "the energy barrier depends on the normalized external force @xmath26 as @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "another important parameter in the theory is the value of the curvature in the metastable minimum ( @xmath4 ) and the barrier ( @xmath5 ) . in this case @xmath28 .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of langevin equation  ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "the equations were numerically integrated using the stochastic runge - kutta algorithm  @xcite and the mfpt was computed typically over 10000 realizations . as in our previous work  @xcite",
    ", we have used @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in most of the simulations we use @xmath31 and change @xmath32 and @xmath7.@xcite      first",

    "we show also the pollak and talkner  @xcite ( pt ) and drozdov  @xcite results , which include finite barrier corrections to the escape rates . as a reference we also plot the @xmath33 result  @xcite [ eq .  ( [ tst_e ] ) in the appendix ] .",
    "these results were proposed for the high damping limit of the system .",
    "the figure gives a quantitative estimation of the accuracy of the kramers high damping result for every barrier .",
    "as it can be seen , finite barrier effects are not very severe ( below @xmath34 ) for normalized barriers above 5 .",
    "however some care have to be taken when considering effects involving barriers below this value .",
    "figure also shows the convergence of the escape rate to the kramers infinite barrier result .    as we also see in fig .",
    "[ fig : hdt ] , pt theory gives a _ simple _ expression very close to the exact result except for small barriers .",
    "drozdov gives an even better approach , however its final equation is _ more complex _ and only valid for very high values of the damping .",
    "pt approach fails at low barriers and drozdov is a good approximation only in the overdamped limit .",
    "we propose below an expression for the escape rate which gives a good approximation for any barrier height and damping .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt ] ) is exact in the overdamped limit of the system .",
    "however there is no result for the mfpt at other values of the damping of the system .",
    "our proposal is based in observing our numerical results for the escape rate at different values of damping as a function of the normalized barrier @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hd ] shows results for @xmath36 ( inset ) and @xmath37 [ note that , different from fig .",
    "[ fig : hdt ] , now we normalize the rate with respect to eq .",

    "( [ mfpt ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hd ] also shows that , except for the @xmath40 curve ( we will show below that this value of damping corresponds to the moderate damping region where @xmath41 gets a maximum ) , all data approximately lie in a same curve when compared to the @xmath42 prediction . thus , we propose the following simple extension of the mfpt results of eq .",
    "( [ mfpt ] ) to the moderate - to - high damping region : @xmath43 the formula recovers the correct @xmath44 result for @xmath8 and incorporates the @xmath7 dependence suggested in fig .  [ fig : hd ] .",
    "as we will see , this expression gives account of our numerical results in the moderate - to - high damping regime of the problem in a simpler and better way than any previous approach .    in order to evaluate the accuracy of eq .",
    "( [ rmhd ] ) , we have performed numerical simulations of the escape rate of the system as a function of @xmath7 for different values of the barrier . in particular , fig .",

    "smaller values of @xmath7 sets in the moderate - to - low damping regime that we studied previously  @xcite .",

    "we plot the escape rate normalized by our theoretical expression , @xmath51 versus @xmath47 .",
    "we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ rmhd ] ) reproduces our numerical results in a better way than previous theories for any barrier and in the full moderate - to - high damping regime .",

    "( [ rmhd ] ) for damping values above @xmath52 in our units . at this",
    "intermediate values of the damping parameter we are into the so - called turnover region , which characterizes the transition between the moderate - to - low and the moderate - to - high damping regimes . there , the classical transition state theory establishes @xmath53 .      in order to supplement the information given in previous works , fig .",
    "[ fig : rgw](a ) shows the escape rate divided by the @xmath54 result for a wide range of damping values with special emphasis in the turnover region . as expected ,",
    "when plotted as a function of the normalized damping @xmath47 all curves collapse one each other only in the high damping limit . as barrier increases , the maximum moves to lower values of @xmath47 . in any case rate approaches very slowly to the infinite barrier limit .",
    "the figure also shows the theoretical results studied in ref .   and here .",
    "we see that the combination of the drozdov - hayashi  @xcite result for moderate - to - low damping values and our extension of the mean first passage time result for moderate - to - high ones , give a fairly good approximation to the numerically computed result for all damping of the system .",
    "[ fig : rgw](b ) shows the results for @xmath55 and also plots three other theoretical approaches . on the one hand we use the kramers moderate to high damping result and the buttiker - harris - landauer  @xcite ( bhl ) one .",
    "we see that the latter deviates importantly in the moderate damping region of the system .",
    "to finish we also plot the result of the simplest analytical expression which approach the escape rate for all damping , which is given by the following interpolation formula@xcite : @xmath56 where for a linear - cubic barrier we have @xmath57 and @xmath42 is given by eq .",
    "( [ kramers ] ) .",
    "this is a simple expression which , as seen in the figure , gives a first glance good idea of the escape rate behavior in the full damping spectrum of the system .",
    "the general expression for the mfpt , eq .  ( [ mfpt ] ) , depends on the injection , @xmath12 , and absorption , @xmath13 , points .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the adequate choice for both numbers in order to keep eq .",
    "( [ r_t ] ) valid usually relies on relatively vague criteria since for particles starting in a metastable well _ far enough _ the barrier and adsorbed in another well _ well beyond _",
    "the barrier , the dependence on @xmath12 and @xmath13 is negligible .",
    "thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be both far from the barrier .",

    "figure  [ fig : mfpt_x ] explores @xmath58 as a function of @xmath13 for @xmath59 ( the potential minimum position ) and different values of the model parameters . as it can be seen , the mfpt changes importantly in the barrier region .",
    "as expected the time to reach the next potential minimum approximately doubles the time to get the maximum .",
    "a similar study can be done to know the dependence of the mfpt on the injection position of the system , @xmath12 .",
    "there exist problems where the relevant physical magnitude is the mean time spent by the system to reach the maximum of the potential barrier ( the transition state @xmath60 in fig .  [",
    "fig : pot ] ) .",
    "we call here this time @xmath61 to distinguish it from @xmath11 , defined above as the time to reach state c beyond the barrier .",
    "let us introduce the factor @xmath62 for the ratio between both times . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpt_x ] , a rough estimation in the high damping limit is that @xmath63 , showing that a particle in the maximum has a probability close to one half to cross the barrier and close to one half to move backwards to the original well .",
    "however , this is not exactly the case and as it is well known  @xcite the so called stochastic separatrix is sited beyond the barrier and differs from the deterministic separatrix .",
    "there , interesting dynamic effects appear in the brownian dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath61 can be computed in the overdamped limit from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt ] ) fixing absorption limit @xmath13 at the potential barrier position .",
    "we have numerically explored how @xmath64 depends on the normalized barrier height @xmath45 and damping of the system .",
    "we should expect a weak dependence on the barrier at high enough values of @xmath45 .",
    "with respect to the damping , @xmath64 changes smoothly from a value close to 0.5 for high damping to 1 for small damping . at",
    "small damping any particle that reaches the maximum has enough energy to overcome the barrier and rapidly slides down to the next potential minimum .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp](a ) plots @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 at different values of the damping @xmath7 . figure  [ fig : comp](b ) shows @xmath64 as a function of the normalized damping @xmath47 at different values of the normalized barrier @xmath45 .",
    "we can see that @xmath64 depends very weakly on the barrier except for values of @xmath66 .",
    "in which respects to the damping dependence , @xmath64 changes from @xmath67 at our parameters for @xmath68 to @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    in a similar way that for evaluating escape rates , it would be useful to get an analytical expression to computing the mean time to reach the maximum at different values of the parameters of the system . from fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](b ) we see that for every barrier we can write @xmath71 . following the ansatz used to derive eq .",
    "( [ rmhd ] ) we now propose  @xcite @xmath72 for the case of a parabolic barrier . there @xmath73 is computed from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp ] compares this equation to the numerical results for two possible values of @xmath74 , 0.5 and 0.545 .",
    "though agreement is worse than that for the escape rate case , to our knowledge this is the first attempt to propose an expression for the @xmath75 dependence .",
    "in a typical force spectroscopy experiment the probability distribution function of the escape force @xmath76 is measured performing many experiments where force is continuously increased at a given rate @xmath77 . from these results the mean escape force @xmath78 and its standard deviation can be trivially computed .",
    "such @xmath76 can be easily related to the escape rates @xmath79 as  @xcite @xmath80 alike , escape rates can be computed from measured @xmath76 . in this section",
    "we will show results of the mean escape force in our system for different parameter conditions and compare to available theories .    as in the case of the escape rate and its relation with the mfpt , it is possible to introduce different definitions of escape force . in our simulations we start at zero force with particles in a metastable state ( state a in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] ) and increase the force at a given ramp .",
    "then we define the escape force as the mean force for which particles first reach the next metastable state ( state c ) .",
    "however , in some circumstances the relevant escape force can be related with a different state , for instance the potential barrier ( state b ) . in the first case",
    "we say that a particle has escaped if it has reached a new potential minimum , in the second if it has just passed the potential maximum .    figure  [ fig : mm ] shows the results of the mean escape force computed for both cases . as expected , @xmath78 increases with the damping and both curves overlap for moderate damping and differ at larger ones .",
    "figure also shows the theoretical results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(f ) ] ) with @xmath79 computed as eqs .",
    "( [ rmhd ] ) and ( [ rmhd_m ] ) , in this last case using @xmath81 .",
    "as expected , such curves give account of the numerical results in all the studied range .",
    "we want to remark that the difference between both curves at high damping is due to the factor close to 0.5 between the mfpt for reaching states b or c. thus , a factor of 0.5 in the prefactor of the rates has a measurable effect in the measured critical force value , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] .",
    "we also compare our results with predictions from eqs .",
    "( [ kramers ] ) and ( [ kramers_hd ] ) and analytical results by garg  @xcite , see appendix . based on the small error found in the estimation of the system escape rates , we can advance that even the simplest theories give fairly good results .",
    "such analysis is made in the top inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] where the theoretical results obtained from the kramers high damping and the kramers moderate - to - high damping results ( red lines ) and the first order garg theory ( black dashed lines ) for high and moderate damping are shown .",
    "it is interesting to remark that in this numerical experiment escape happens at moderate to low values of the barrier over temperature ratio ( see bottom inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] ) .",
    "thus we see that results obtained from the infinite barrier limit give reasonable estimations for physical processes involving such small barrier values .",
    "next , we are going to discuss an important issue , regarding the validity of the available theories at very high damping values or force rates , where strong nonequilibrium effects plays a role . at high damping escape events",
    "are very rare and , if the force is varied fast enough the critical force of the model ( for which barrier disappears ) is reached before particles have reached the barrier .",
    "then we can say that the escape problem is somehow ill - defined .",
    "these observations are studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc_gr ] where the high @xmath0 limit is reached . at high damping the probability distribution function @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 and @xmath7 through the @xmath0 product .",
    "as seen in the figure , the nonequilibrium high @xmath0 regime appears in our simulations for @xmath82 ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "there we observe that an increasingly important fraction of the realizations do not escape before getting the critical force value ( @xmath30 ) for which the potential profile does not show a metastable well structure anymore .",
    "this situation is shown by the filled circles curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc_gr ] where the mean escape force of the fraction of particles that have escaped from the potential well for @xmath85 is plotted .",
    "an adequate theoretical calculation based on the mfpt results allows for reproducing the observed results even in this regime . to compare ,",
    "we have also computed the mean force for the particles to advance from the starting point @xmath12 to a point @xmath86 .",
    "result is show by open circles in the figure and , as expected , the theoretical results based in mfpt theory are also able to explain our results .    for the sake of completeness we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : esp ] a plot of the normalized mean escape force for a wide range of damping values , @xmath87 and two different force rates . as shown before , the escape rate has a maximum for @xmath88 and thus the escape force presents a minimum for such damping value . for larger values of @xmath7 our eq .",
    "( [ rmhd ] ) , correctly estimates the escape force . for smaller values of @xmath7 ,",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the dh equation for low damping escape  @xcite is valid .",
    "however , given the relative complexity of both approaches , we want to compare the results to those obtained with a simple interpolation formula , and the garg analytical predictions .    the simplest analytical expression which approach the escape rate for all damping is given by the interpolation formula of eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : esp ] , such expression gives a very good approach to the computation of the mean escape force and can be useful to analyze experiments at moderate damping values .",
    "in addition , figure also shows the simple approximation published by garg ( see also appendix ) .",
    "we plot first order approach for moderate and high damping cases and second order for the low damping one .",
    "such results also give a good approach to our numerical results in a wide damping area .",
    "it is important to remark now that as ramp is decreased , the moderate damping area enlarges .",
    "thus , the border between the different damping regions is also given by the force ramp and a good knowledge of both parameters is needed to correctly understand any experimental result .",
    "in this article we have presented a number of results concerning the escape problem for moderate - to - high and high damping and its consequences in force spectroscopy experiments .",
    "such problems include for instance cell to cell adhesion and molecular bond experiments  @xcite , dissociation of molecular complexes  @xcite , mechanical unfolding of proteins  @xcite , single - molecule pulling experiments  @xcite , free - energy reconstruction  @xcite , and study of friction at the nanoscale  @xcite .",
    "our work gives an accurate expression , eq .",
    "( [ rmhd ] ) , for the escape rate in the moderate - to - high and high damping domains and allows for a quantitative evaluation of errors made in the use of different approaches to the problem . this result combined with the dh one for the moderate - to - low and low damping regime allows for an study of the thermal activation problem over a parabolic barrier for any barrier and damping and a comparison with other simpler theoretical approaches .",
    "then we have quantitatively study some issues concerning the relation between mean first passage time and the very definition of a escape rate .",
    "we have considered also the time to reach the barrier problem and compute its ratio with the usual definition of escape rate at different values of the damping .",
    "activation theory at high damping is a central concept in order to understand force spectroscopy results .",
    "we have focused in comparing predictions from the different available theories .",
    "infinite barrier results are usually assumed in literature without an estimation of the real barrier values involved in each case .",
    "we have explored this issue and showed that finite barrier effects do not importantly affect force spectroscopy results though escape indeed may occur at very low barrier values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] ) .",
    "this was also obtained in ref .  .",
    "we have also discussed the role of @xmath89 as the relevant parameter at high damping .    as discussed in section iii and fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpt_x ] , the very concept of _ escape rate _ loss its significance if position initial conditions play a role .",
    "this happens when the two relevant time scales , equilibration at the metastable well and escape time are not separate .",
    "separation of time scales is a central issue in the theory that has been qualitatively discussed in most of the seminal papers .",
    "[ fig : mfpt_x ] summarizes our quantitative study .",
    "then , it appears that the concept of an escape rate becomes questionable for barrier heights below 3 ( in units of @xmath90 ) . in relation to this ,",
    "[ fig : hd ] shows that theory correctly accounts for our numerical expectations at lower barriers , but certainly it has been obtained with well defined initial conditions",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] also shows a good agreement and there , see bottom inset of the figure , escape happens at very low normalized mean barriers . in this case force has been adiabatically increased and results are not affected by the chosen initial conditions at @xmath91 .",
    "to finish , fig .",
    "[ fig : fc_gr ] gives , in terms of the @xmath0 product , the limit of validity of theory when applied to force spectroscopy problems .",
    "this limit is certainly reached when the separation of time scales concept fails .",
    "another important issue is the role played by the damping parameter .",
    "this is a pretty difficult issue to evaluate in many real systems , although the validity of the high damping approach is usually assumed .",
    "we see that , on the one hand , high damping theories works fine for dimensionless damping @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath0 product goes above @xmath93 , important non - equilibrium effects appear and usual escape rate theories are not valid any more .",
    "we have pointed out the existence of a high @xmath89 limit beyond which the escape problem is not well defined ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fc_gr ] ) .    frequently , the main source of uncertainty in the problem is the potential profile itself .",
    "then , sometimes it is assumed @xmath94 with @xmath95 some empirical prefactor . in such cases ,",
    "all interest is focused on the barrier value and the field dependence of this barrier , and the _ weak _ @xmath95 dependence with @xmath32 is neglected . however , in general , @xmath95 contains information about the damping , the bias field and the barrier shape .    in adhesion and other similar problems ,",
    "free energy is frequently modeled by a tilted morse - type potential .",
    "then , the applied field creates a barrier  @xcite .",
    "however , next potential minimum is sited at @xmath96 and escape rate is vaguely defined in terms of being far ( but not too far ) from the potential barrier . in addition , in some force spectroscopy experiments , the measured maximal spring force corresponds to a rupture event  @xcite .",
    "then the particle over barrier picture may fail and the problem can be studied as time to reach a given force , position or a maximum of a potential profile .",
    "mean time to reach the maximum can be an useful concept for some specific problems and sometimes , when a cusplike barrier is assumed , it is the only meaningful one .",
    "however , since in many cases the prefactor is not carefully considered , possible errors on choosing the correct picture are unwittingly integrated in uncertainties on the different parameters involved in the escape rate prefactor .",
    "this is an interesting problem that we are currently studying in depth .    in force friction experiments ,",
    "mean friction force is computed from the maximum force in each stick - slip  @xcite cycle .",
    "a study using expressions for the escape rate beyond the usual kramers approach to the escape rate is lacking .",
    "most of the previously discussed issues are also relevant when analyzing single - molecule pulling experiments  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question here is that of the reconstruction of free - energy landscapes  @xcite .",
