    "phase coherence is one of the fundamental properties of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "it is also a key feature in the present developments of the research on condensates which , ten years after the first experimental realization , go in the direction of integrating this powerful tool into other branches of physics , of which metrology and quantum information are two promising examples @xcite .",
    "the problem of the condensate phase dynamics due to atomic interactions at zero temperature has been analyzed by different authors in theory @xcite and in experiment @xcite .",
    "it is now well understood that an initially prepared relative phase between two condensates will spread in time due to the corresponding uncertainty in the relative particle number as the relative phase and the relative particle number are conjugate variables .",
    "the phase dynamics of a two component condensate in realistic situations including harmonic traps , non stationarity and fluctuations in the total number of particles was analyzed in @xcite , where a comparison to the experiments of @xcite is also performed .",
    "an important conclusion was that the zero temperature theory could not account for the coherence times observed in experiment , which raises the question of the role of the non - condensed fraction .    in this paper",
    "we address the fundamental problem of phase spreading of a bose - einstein condensate in a finite temperature atomic gas . in order to obtain simple and general results ,",
    "we consider the ideal case of a spatially uniform condensate at thermodynamic equilibrium , and we assume that one has access to the first order temporal correlation function @xmath0 of the component @xmath1 of the atomic field in the condensate mode . in real life , the situation is more complex : the atoms are trapped in harmonic potentials , and the measurement of phase coherence is a delicate procedure , usually relying on the interference between two condensates @xcite . in the literature two",
    "well distinct predictions exist for the long time spreading of the condensate phase at finite temperature , either a diffusive behavior ( variance growing linearly in time ) @xcite or a ballistic behavior ( variance growing quadratically in time ) @xcite .",
    "we study this problem first with a classical field model @xcite , where exact numerical simulations can be performed .",
    "we then explain the numerics analytically , and extend the analytical approach to the quantum case .",
    "the important result that we obtain is that the variance of the phase increases quadratically in time .",
    "this is at variance with the prediction of phase diffusion from the  quantum optics \" open system approaches of @xcite assuming the condensate to evolve under the influence of langevin short memory fluctuating forces .",
    "our prediction results from two ingredients , ( i ) the system is prepared in an initial state with an energy fluctuating from one experimental realization to the other , here sampling the canonical ensemble , and ( ii ) the system is isolated in its further evolution and therefore keeps a constant energy .",
    "as we shall see , the combination of these two ingredients prevents some temporal correlation functions to vanish at long times .",
    "our prediction qualitatively agrees with the one of @xcite , but not quantitatively , as we obtain a different expression for the long time limit of the variance of the phase over the time squared .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that we take into account ergodicity in the system resulting from the interactions among bogoliubov modes such as the beliaev - landau processes .    in section [ sec : tcfm ]",
    "we present the classical field model ; numerical predictions for this model are presented in section [ sec : cfnr ] , and analytical results reproducing the numerics at short or long times are given in section [ sec : cfar ] .",

    "we conclude in section [ sec : c ] .",
    "in this section we develop a classical field model that has the advantage that it can be exactly simulated numerically .",
    "this will allow us to understand the physics governing the spreading of the condensate phase and to test the validity of various approximations , paving the way to the quantum treatment .",
    "we consider a lattice model for a classical field @xmath2 in three dimensions .",
    "the lattice spacings are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 along the three directions of space and @xmath6 is the volume of the unit cell in the lattice .",

    "the evolution of the field is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dispersion relation of the non - interacting waves , and the binary interaction between particles in the real gas is reflected in the classical field model by a field self - interaction with a coupling constant @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath26-wave scattering length of two atoms .    in general",
    ", we expect the predictions of a classical field model to be cut - off dependent , i.e.  the predictions of our model may depend on the lattice spacings @xmath27 .",
    "we use here a refinement to the usual classical field model , which makes it cut - off independent for _ some _ observables like the condensate fraction , a quantity expected to play an important role here .",
    "an obvious example of a quantity which will remain cut - off dependent is the mean value of the hamiltonian @xmath28 in thermal equilibrium .",
    "let us consider first the non - interacting case ( @xmath29 ) in presence of a condensate .",
    "for a thermalized classical field the occupation numbers of the excited plane wave modes are given by the equipartition formula @xmath30 we adjust the dispersion relation @xmath23 in order to reproduce the bose law for the occupation numbers of the quantum field in the bose - condensed regime : @xmath31 for all modes with large occupation number @xmath32 , while the occupation of modes with @xmath33 , whose quantum dynamics is not well approximated by the classical field model anyway , is exponentially suppressed as in the quantum theory .    in the interacting case , one could adapt the same trick of a modified dispersion relation , by including the fact that the relevant spectrum is not @xmath34 but the bogoliubov spectrum @xcite .",
