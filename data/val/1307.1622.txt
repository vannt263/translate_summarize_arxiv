    "the images show three main peculiarities : an inner cavity ( inside @xmath7 ) with light depleted by a factor down a few tenths , a quasi - circular rim surrounding the cavity , and two spiral arms extending from the rim outward",
    ".    apart from the spiral structure ( probably due to a companion orbiting at large scale , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* muto et al . 2012 ) ) , the most tantalizing aspect suggested by these images is the different cavity size of small grains ( 28 au ) with respect to large grains ( 39 au , ( * ? ? ?",

    "similar discrepancies were recently pointed - out by ( * ? ? ? * dong et al .",

    "the cavity for small grains is likely to be due to tidal interaction with a companion .",
    "photoevaporation and dust grain growth are indeed ruled - out : because of high accretion rate ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sitko et al . 2012 ) ) and sub - au inner dust belt ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fedele et al . 2008 ) ) the former , abrupt radial profile ( this work ) and absence of mm - size grains ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brown et al . 2009 ) ) the latter .",
    "the scenario with clearing by a companion orbiting inside the cavity may also explain the observed dissimilarity in the cavity sizes .",
    "in fact , the pile - up of large grains due to a giant planet can occur at up to 10 tidal radii ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pinilla et al . 2012 ) ) , whereas the outer edge of the gaseous halo can not exceed 5 tidal radii ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dodson - robinson & salyk 2011 ) ) .",
    "we suggest a scenario ( see fig.[sketch ] ) where a giant planet is generating a pressure bump at 39 au , which holds back mm - size grains but allows @xmath0m - size grains to be dragged inward along with the gas as down as 28 au .",
    "non - keplerian flows of gas and small dust grains can still be present in the cavity , thus to sustain the inner dust belt and the high accretion rate of the source .",
    "we analytically find that a 5 to 15 @xmath8 at 17 to 20 au is consistent with the observed cavity sizes .",
