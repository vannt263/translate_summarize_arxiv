    "electromagnetic ( em ) waves are vastly used in our daily life and their generation is considered as one of most developed scientific and technological fields .",
    "however there still exists a region around terahertz ( thz ) frequencies which have wide applications such as radar , drug detection , safety - check , and so on , lacking of compact solid - state generator.@xcite    it has been known for a long time that the josephson junctions can work as oscillators to excite high - frequency em waves.@xcite artificial josephson junctions were used first,@xcite but the frequency is below thz due to the small superconducting energy gap in conventional superconductors . the discovery of intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs ) in layered high - t@xmath2 superconductor provides a fantastic chance to achieve strong coherent thz radiation.@xcite the advantages of ijjs over conventional low - temperature junctions are as follows .",
    "first , the junctions are homogeneous at the atomic scale guaranteed by the high quality of single crystals , and second the superconductivity gap is large , which in principle permits the frequency to cover the whole range of thz band .",
    "much effort has been made to stimulate powerful radiation based on ijjs .",
    "@xcite    an experimental breakthrough was made in 2007 , where the thz radiation was observed based on ijjs from bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bscco ) mesa by biasing a dc voltage.@xcite the key experimental results are following : the frequency of the radiation em wave and the bias voltage obey the ac josephson relation , and the frequency equals one of the cavity modes determined by the lateral size of mesa.@xcite    a novel @xmath3 kink state has been proposed , which can explain the important experimental results.@xcite this state is characterized by static @xmath4 phase kinks in the lateral directions of the mesa , which align themselves alternatingly along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "the @xmath3 phase kinks provide a strong coupling between the uniform dc current and the cavity modes , which permits large supercurrent flow into the system at the cavity resonances , thus enhances the plasma oscillation and radiates strong em wave from the mesa edge.@xcite        even with this novel mechanism , the radiation power based on ijjs is still weak due to the small radiation area limited by the mesa thickness ( @xmath6 ) , and enhancement of the radiation power remains a problem . here",
    "we propose to use a long cylindrical bscco single crystal embedded in a dielectric material as shown schematically in fig.1 . in this way",
    ", on one hand we can increase the radiation area , and on the other hand we can have a cavity .",
    "then there is a question : what is the optimal dielectric material for strong radiation ?    in order to answer this question , we solve the cavity modes and quality factor through maxwell s equations , and analyze the phase dynamics in ijjs according to the coupled sine - gordon equations .",
    "we find that the radiation power has a maximum when the dielectric constant is tuned .",
    "it turns out that the maximum is achieved when the radiation power equals the plasma dissipation .",
    "this gives us the optimal dielectric constant of wrapping material in terms of the property of the superconductive single crystal .",
    "the maximal radiation power is proportional to the typical superconducting current squared and the typical normal resistance , or the gap energy squared divided by the typical normal resistance .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the cavity modes and quality factor of the system according to maxwell s equations . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the phase dynamics associated with @xmath3 phase kink state in ijjs based on coupled sine - gordon equations . in sec .",

    "there are two kinds of cavity modes , namely perfect magnetic conductor ( pmc ) like one , and perfect electric conductor ( pec ) like one.@xcite here we take the pmc - like ( 1,1 ) mode as an example , and the extension for other modes is straightforward .",
    "the spatial part of electric field in the @xmath5 direction for pmc - like ( 1,1 ) mode inside the bscco cylinder is given by@xcite @xmath13 with the cylindrical coordinate @xmath14 , @xmath15 the eigen wave number of pmc - like ( 1,1 ) mode , as shown in fig .",

    "the maximal radiation power is not affected by the radius of the bscco cylinder .",
    "the reason for this is that when the radius of the bscco cylinder increases , more current can be injected in , but the eigen frequency will decrease ( proportional to the inverse of radius ) , with these two factors canceling each other . the optimal radiation power eq.([optimalp ] ) is apparently similar to the result in ref . , but there the discussion was limited to nonresonant junctions .",

    "the maximal radiation power is therefore given by power per unit length .",
    "bulaevskii and koshelev discussed the case that synchronization is achieved by the coupling between josephson plasma and em wave.@xcite therefore , their maximal radiation power is achieved when the length of bscco single crystal at @xmath5-axis equals the em wave length .",

    "we find that the radiation power has a maximum when the dielectric constant is tuned .",
    "the maximum is achieved when the radiation power equals the plasma dissipation which yields the optimal dielectric constant of wrapping material in terms of the properties of the superconductive single crystal .",
    "the maximal radiation is proportional to the typical superconducting current squared and the typical normal resistance , or the gap energy squared divided by the typical normal resistance , which offers a guideline for choosing superconductor as a source of strong radiation .",
