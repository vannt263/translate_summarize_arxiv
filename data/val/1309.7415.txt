    "the study of the boundary structure of polyhedra arising from combinatorial optimization problems has been a very successful undertaking in the field of polyhedral combinatorics .",
    "part of this success relies on a very rich interplay between geometric and algebraic properties of the faces of such polyhedra and corresponding combinatorial structures of the problems they encode .",
    "this remains true even in the context of some np - hard problems , where one is generally resigned to seek partial characterizations of the boundary structure via some families of facets .",
    "a different line of attack on combinatorial optimization problems , which has become quite popular , is that of utilizing semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations . for the stable set problem on perfect graphs ,",
    "semidefinite formulations provide the only known approach for efficient solution .",
    "feasible regions of sdps , known as _ spectrahedra _ , are in general much richer in complexity than polyhedra .",
    "however , or perhaps owing to that , it is reasonable to presume the existence of a wealth of combinatorial information encoded in the boundary structure of spectrahedra arising from combinatorial optimization problems . indeed , since semidefinite optimization is a strict generalization of linear optimization , sdps should in principle encode at least all that is known via polyhedral combinatorics",
    ".    nonetheless , currently , results relating the boundary structure of sdps and combinatorial properties of the corresponding problems are rather scarce . in fact , even the study of the boundary structure of sdps _ per  se _ is somewhat limited .",
    "a representative sample seems to be given by  @xcite .",
    "a plausible reason behind this scarcity is simple to guess . from the viewpoint of linear conic",
    "optimization , a ( pointed ) polyhedron is the intersection of the nonnegative orthant  @xmath0 with an affine subspace of  @xmath1 , whereas a spectrahedron is the intersection of the positive semidefinite cone  @xmath2 with an affine subspace of the set  @xmath3 of @xmath4 symmetric matrices . by regarding @xmath3 as  @xmath5 ( and thus stripping off the extremely convenient algebraic structure of  @xmath3 ) , one could argue that nothing is gained in terms of ambient space or affine constraints when moving from polyhedra to spectrahedra ( though we shall question this very statement later on ) . on the other hand , the boundary structure of the cone @xmath2 , while completely understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "is far more intricate than that of  @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is in fact separable in that it may be written as the direct sum of  @xmath6 copies of the nonnegative line  @xmath7 . in this context",
    ", one is comparing the rich boundary structure of  @xmath2 with the trivial boundary structure of  @xmath7 .",
    "this difference in complexity goes even further when contrasting the boundary structure of spectrahedra and polyhedra , since the intersection of an affine subspace with  @xmath2 can be so pathological that strong duality as well as strict complementarity may fail for sdps .    in this paper , we are interested in the _ vertices _ of spectrahedra arising from combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "we focus on sdps relaxations of the two combinatorial problems most successfully attacked via sdps , namely ,  and the stable set problem .",
    "the aspects of the boundary structure we shall study revolve around the concept of _ normal cone_. by carefully analyzing a simple expression for the normal cone , we identify all vertices of some of the spectrahedra arising from these two problems .",
    "we also point out a simple relation between normal cones and strict complementarity , which may be helpful in proving that the latter holds for specific sdps .",
    "vertices are naturally among the first objects to understand in a study of the boundary structure .",
    "recall that a _ vertex _ of a convex set is an _ extreme point _ of that set whose normal cone is full - dimensional . for a polyhedron ,",
    "extreme points and vertices coincide , and there are only finitely many of them . on the other hand , the unit ball @xmath8 , which is linearly isomorphic to a spectrahedron , has infinitely many extreme points and no vertices whenever @xmath9 . indeed , the extreme points of the unit ball  @xmath10 in  @xmath1 centered at the origin are precisely the unit vectors , but the normal cone at each such vector is one - dimensional . this example illustrates why an extreme point of a set whose normal cone is one - dimensional is called _ smooth _ , and how the dimension of a normal cone at a point is a measure of the `` degree of non - smoothness '' of the set at that point .",
    "vertices of a convex set can also be regarded as the only likely points to optimize a uniformly chosen linear function , in the following sense .",
    "fix a full - dimensional convex set  @xmath11 and a point  @xmath12 . now choose a unit vector @xmath13 uniformly at random .",
    "then the probability that @xmath14 is an optimal solution for the optimization problem @xmath15 is positive if and only if @xmath14 is a vertex of  @xmath16 .",
    "the property described above may have practical significance in some contexts where one formulates an sdp relaxation to a problem and the vertices of the feasible region correspond exactly to the combinatorial ( or non - convex ) objects from that problem .",
    "this kind of situation may be useful in low - rank recovery schemes ; see  @xcite .",
    "other instances occur in combinatorial optimization , in some previous results which suggest that vertices of feasible regions of sdps play an analogous role to that of extreme points in polyhedral combinatorics .",
    "we discuss these next .",
    "we start with the _ elliptope _",
    "@xmath17 , the spectrahedron arising from the famous sdp relaxation for utilized by goemans and williamson  @xcite in their approximation algorithm .",
    "laurent and poljak  @xcite proved that all the vertices of the elliptope are rank - one , i.e. , they correspond precisely to the _ exact _ solutions to the  problem .",
    "next , we consider the _ theta body _  @xmath18 of a graph  @xmath19 , introduced in  @xcite as a relaxation of the stable set polytope of  @xmath19 .",
    "shepherd  @xcite observed that , by a result of  @xcite , the vertices of  @xmath18 are precisely the incidence vectors of stable sets of  @xmath19 , i.e. , again the _ exact _",
    "solutions for the stable set problem .",
    "as far as we know , these are the only results in the literature about vertices of spectrahedra arising from combinatorial optimization problems",
    ".    one of our main results is both a generalization of the aforementioned result by laurent and poljak and a different version of shepherd s observation .",
    "we describe it briefly .",
    "the theta body  @xmath18 of a graph  @xmath20 is naturally described as the projection onto  @xmath21 of the feasible region of an sdp lying in the space of symmetric matrices indexed by  @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a new element .",
    "we denote this feasible region by @xmath24 .",
    "when the graph  @xmath19 has no edges , then @xmath24 is a well - known relaxation of the _ boolean quadric polytope _ and it is linearly isomorphic to the elliptope  @xmath25 .",
    "we will prove that , for any graph  @xmath19 , all vertices of  @xmath24 are rank - one , i.e. , they are the _ exact _ solutions for the stable set problem in the sense that they are the symmetric tensors of incidence vectors of stable sets in  @xmath19 .",
    "using similar arguments , we shall find all vertices of some well - known variants of @xmath24 and  @xmath17 .",
    "these include the sdp usually presented to introduce the lovsz theta number and its variants , and also the sdp studied by kleinberg and goemans  @xcite for the vertex cover problem .",
    "we should remark that throughout the paper we only study spectrahedra in a very special form . in the literature ,",
    "it is common to define spectrahedra as sets of the form @xmath26 for given matrices @xmath27 ; the defining constraint is known as a linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) . for the sake of convenience , we shall instead focus only on spectrahedra defined as the intersection of the cone  @xmath2 with an affine subspace of  @xmath3 .",
    "an advantage is that , by confining ourselves to subsets of symmetric matrices , we retain the ability to use directly the simple but powerful algebraic structure of the underlying space  @xmath3 .",
    "we start the next section with a general set - up for convex optimization problems in conic form . in this general form , we state and",
    "prove a dual characterization of the normal cone .",
    "then we turn to the vertices of spectrahedra arising from interesting combinatorial optimization problems . continuing with the normal cone , duality and boundary structure themes ,",
    "we conclude with a discussion of characterization of strict complementarity via the normal cone and facially exposed faces of the polar convex bodies .",
