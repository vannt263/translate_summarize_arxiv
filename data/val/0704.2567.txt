    "this work addresses the problem of explaining the second law of thermodynamics on the basis of the microscopic laws of mechanics . as discussed earlier @xcite the second law of thermodynamics",
    "is commonly understood as composed of two parts which we shall conventionally label as `` part a '' and `` part b '' .",
    "`` part a '' is essentially a statement about the _ existence of entropy_. it says that there exists an integrating factor @xmath1 , interpreted as inverse temperature , such that @xmath2 is an exact differential , where @xmath3 is the heat exchanged during a very small variation of the thermodynamic state @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that there exists a function of the thermodynamic state , the entropy @xmath5 , that generates the exact differential @xmath6 `` part a '' of the second law evidently pertains to _ equilibrium thermodynamics_. its mechanical foundations have been studied in a previous work @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion drawn in that work was that the laws of ergodic hamiltonian mechanics alone are sufficient for providing a rather satisfactory explanation of this part of the second law .",
    "the approach adopted was that of establishing a correspondence between the _ thermodynamic _ quantities @xmath7 and certain suitably chosen time - averaged _ mechanical _ quantities .",
    "thanks to a generalization of helmholtz theorem , then we were able to find the proper _ mechanical analogue _ of thermodynamic entropy .",
    "this is the so called _ volume entropy _ : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the system s hamilton function .",
    "this is a function of the @xmath10 dimensional phase - space vector @xmath11 and the external parameter @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is an arbitrary constant with the dimensions of action .",
    "the present contribution completes the previous one by addressing `` part b '' of the second law .",
    "`` part b '' is essentially the law of entropy increase , and as such is a statement that pertains to _ non - equilibrium thermodynamics_. to avoid any possible confusion , here by `` part b '' of the second law and `` law of entropy increase '' , we mean clausius formulation of the entropy principle @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the entropy principle : for every _ nicht umkehrbar _ process in a thermally isolated system which begins and ends in an equilibrium state , the entropy of the final state is greater than or equal to that of the initial state . for every _ umkehrbar _ process in a thermally isolated system the entropy of the final state is equal to that of the initial state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the expressions _",
    "nicht umkehrbar _ and _ umkehrbar _ could be translated into the current scientific english as _ non quasi static _ and _ quasi static _ respectively .",
    "it must be stressed that the entropy principle refers to transformations caused by the variation of some external field , and is not at all a statement about the _ spontaneous tendencies _ of physical systems .",
    "if the variation of the external field is acted in such a way as to drive the system out of equilibrium ( non quasi static process ) the entropy will increase .",
    "if it is acted in such a way that the system will remain arbitrary close to equilibrium ( quasi static process ) then the entropy will not change .",
    "indeed the volume entropy already well accounts for the `` quasi static '' part of the entropy principle . in facts , as it is known since the work of @xcite , the volume entropy is an _ ergodic adiabatic invariant_. namely a quantity that does not change during a quasi - static transformation of the external field .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the laws of ergodic hamiltonian mechanics alone provide a quite satisfactory explanation of the `` quasi static '' part of the entropy principle : no statistics is needed to explain the equal sign in the entropy principle .",
    "it must be emphasized that here we are establishing a correspondence between the thermodynamic concept of quasi static process and the classical mechanical concept of adiabatic transformation .",
    "in particular the expression `` adiabatic '' will not be used as synonym of `` thermally insulated '' as customarily happens in thermodynamics text - books .",
    "obviously the fact that the volume entropy well accounts for `` part a '' and the quasi static part of `` part b '' of the second law , suggests that it might turn out to be very useful in addressing the non quasi static part of `` part b '' .",
    "simple considerations suggest that the latter could be proved only in some statistical or averaged sense , though .",
    "consider for example a 1d particle of mass @xmath14 in a 1d box of length @xmath15 .",
    "the particle bounces forth and back inside the box .",
    "let @xmath16 be the energy of the particle .",
    "imagine that we can change to length of the box by moving the right wall of the box .",
    "the volume entropy of this elementary ergodic system is simply @xmath17 .",
    "now imagine that we perform a very fast compression of the box , much faster than the particle period of motion @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the final length of the box .",
    "imagine that during this transformation the particle is far from the moving wall and does not bounce against it .",
    "its energy would not change but the change of its volume entropy would be @xmath20",
    ". namely it would be negative .",
    "this simple argument should convince that any purely mechanical attempt to prove the entropy principle on the basis of volume entropy would be vain .",
    "we certainly need to add some statistical ingredient if we want to prove it .",
    "thus we are going to assume that the initial energy of our insulated system is not known .",
    "all we know is that it is within some range @xmath21 with some probability @xmath22 .",
    "the symbol @xmath23 denotes the `` density of states '' at energy @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath23 is also named surface integral @xcite or structure function @xcite . for example , if we first place the system in thermal contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath24 , and then we remove the contact , we will not know for certain what the energy of the system will be , but we will know that @xmath25 .    in this work we will prove that , provided that @xmath26 is a decreasing function of @xmath16 , the _ expectation value _ of the volume entropy",
    "will be larger than its initial one .",
    "it turns out that such proof is much easier in quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics .",
    "therefore we shall first quantize the volume entropy and then study its behavior under the action of a varying field , that is a time - dependent perturbation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qve ] we introduce the quantum counterpart of the classical volume entropy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] we prove that the expectation value of such quantum operator can only increase , if the initial conditions is represented by a decreasing ordering of probabilities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kelvin ] we discuss how this result relates to thomson s formulation of the second law , whereas in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we compare the quantum volume entropy with other quantum entropies present in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ sec : classical case ] we show how to adapt the quantal proof of sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] to the classical case .",
    "the role of the initial equilibrium is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : initial - condition ] .",
    "we will discuss the fact that the results proven in the paper are direct consequences of the time - reversal symmetric microscopic laws , and that , besides the law of entropy increase , there exists a law of entropy decrease as well .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us first consider the 1d case . in 1d",
    "the volume entropy reads : @xmath27 this can be conveniently reexpressed as the logarithm of the _ reduced action _",
    "@xcite @xmath28 this is also known as the helmholtz entropy @xcite .",
    "quantization of the helmholtz entropy is almost immediate . indeed , using a colorful expression , i would say that eq .",
    "( [ eq : helment ] ) invites the reader to quantize .",
    "using the semiclassical approximation of bohr - sommerfeld @xcite and setting @xmath13 equal to plank s constant allows to see that @xmath29 is a quantized quantity whose possible values are ( within the range of validity of the approximation ) : @xmath30 we can extend this reasoning to multidimensional systems whose dynamics is ergodic . in this general case",
    "the volume entropy is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : volumeentropy ] ) . again using the quasi - classical viewpoint @xcite the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : volumeentropy ] ) approximately counts the number of quantum states not above a certain energy @xmath31 .",
    "since the levels are non degenerate this number is @xmath32 , where one considers that the vacuum state counts as a half state .",
    "the levels are non - degenerate because the corresponding classical dynamics is ergodic .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that ergodicity implies that the hamiltonian is the only integral of motion .",
    "this , translated into the language of quantum mechanics , says that the hamiltonian alone constitute a complete set of commuting observables , so that the only quantum number is @xmath33 .    at this point , it is quite easy to construct the quantum version of volume entropy .",
    "consider a finite ( i.e. , not necessarily macroscopic ) _ non - degenerate _",
    "quantum systems .",
    "let @xmath34 be the _ quantum number operator _",
    ", i.e. : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the complete orthonormal set of hamiltonian s eigenstates .",
    "@xmath37 , the total number of energy levels , can be infinite .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath34 are the energy eingenvectors , and the eigenvalues are the corresponding quantum numbers .",
    "then the _ quantum volume entropy operator _ can be defined as : @xmath38 we adopt a system of units where @xmath39 , boltzmann constant , is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "armed with a quanto - mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy ( [ eq : s = logn ] ) , we can now study its evolution under a time - dependent perturbation .",
    "as prescribed by the entropy principle we shall assume that the system is thermally isolated from the environment .",
    "as discussed previously , the system energy is not known .",
    "this means that the system is assumed to be in a statistical mixture of states , described by a density matrix @xmath41 , rather than a pure state @xmath42 .",
    "as prescribed by the entropy principle we shall also assume that the system be initially at equilibrium .",
    "we will translate this thermodynamic notion into the quantal requirement that @xmath43 .",
    "so the system is at equilibrium whenever @xmath44 and it is out of equilibrium whenever @xmath45 . at @xmath46 ,",
    "we switch on a perturbation .",
    "this is implemented by changing the value of some external parameter @xmath47 during the course of time : @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath47 can be for example the volume @xmath12 of a vessel containing the system , or the value of some external field like an electric or a magnetic field . at time @xmath49",
    ", the perturbation is switched off .",
    "we assume that at some time @xmath50 any transient effect will be vanished and the system attains a new equilibrium state described by some @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 .",
    "thus , before time @xmath53 and after @xmath54 , the system is at equilibrium , and for @xmath55 it is out of equilibrium . due to the perturbation the hamiltonian changes from the initial value @xmath56 to the final value @xmath57 , and accordingly",
    "the quantum entropy operator will change in time and move from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "we introduce the following time - dependent orthonormal basis set @xmath60 .",
    "the vectors @xmath61 are defined as the eigenvectors of the `` frozen '' hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "that is : @xmath63 since at time @xmath53 @xmath64 , then @xmath65=0 $ ] .",
    "this means that @xmath41 is diagonal over the initial basis @xmath66 : @xmath67 as anticipated in the introduction we shall assume that @xmath68 is decreasing : @xmath69 our definition of quantum entropy ( [ eq : s = logn ] ) , is essentially an _ equilibrium _ definition . using the bases @xmath60",
    ", we can extend the definition to the _ out of equilibrium _ case , as following : @xmath70 we shall assume that non - degeneracy is kept at all times .",
    "this implies that there is _ no level crossing _ , and ensures that the quantum number operator gives the correct eigenvalues at all times .",
    "the same assumption is used by @xcite to ensure the proper ordering of energy eigenvalues .",
    "note that , unlike the hamiltonian s spectrum ( [ eq : spectum - h ] ) , the spectrum of the quantum entropy ( [ eq : spectrum - s(t ) ] ) is time - independent .",
    "we define the transition probabilities : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the time evolution operator expressed in terms of the time - ordered exponential @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74 s represent the probabilities that the system will be found in the state @xmath75 at time @xmath76 provided that it was in the state @xmath77 at time @xmath53 .",
    "they satisfy the relations @xcite : @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the change in the expectation value of the quantum entropy @xmath80 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s = logn ] ) we have : @xmath81- tr \\left[\\rho_i      \\mathcal{s}_i\\right ] =   \\sum_{n=0}^k ( p'_n - p_n ) \\ln \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the probability that the system is in state @xmath75 provided that the initial probabilities were @xmath83 .    using the `` summation by parts '' rule @xcite : @xmath84 eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf - si ] ) becomes @xmath85 we have : @xmath86 from eq.s ( [ eq : sum - a - nk ] ) and ( [ eq : a - nk>0 ] ) we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 , therefore using the ordering of probabilities ( [ eq : orderingprobabilities ] ) we get ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath89 where we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum - a - nk ] ) in the last line .",
    "noting that @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltas ] ) , we finally reach the conclusion that : @xmath91 this inequality holds for any transformation acted on a thermally insulated , non degenerate quantum system which is initially at equilibrium with a decreasing ordering of probabilities . to complete the proof of the entropy principle we have to prove that the equal sign holds for adiabatic transformation .",
    "note that the non - degeneracy assumption ensures that the _ quantum adiabatic theorem",
    "_ holds @xcite .",
    "this ensures that the transition probability between states with different quantum number will be null during an adiabatic transformation : @xmath92 therefore , for an adiabatic transformation we get @xmath93 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : pn ] ) , which brings to @xmath94 this concludes our quanto - mechanical proof of the entropy principle .",
    "note that the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - f = s - i ] ) is not surprising because the quantum entropy operator has been defined as the quantum counterpart of a classical adiabatic invariant .    also note that we have established and used the following correspondences between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics :    * entropy @xmath95 * equilibrium @xmath96 * ( non)quasi - static process @xmath97(non)adiabatic perturbation    since the equilibrium condition for the final state has never been used in the proof , inequality ( [ eq : entropy - increase ] ) holds for any @xmath98 .",
    "note that this by no means implies that @xmath99\\ ] ] is a monotonic increasing function of time .",
    "all we can say is that if at times @xmath100 the density matrix is diagonal and its spectrum is monotonic decreasing , then : @xmath101 in general there can well be two times @xmath102 , where for example the system is out of equilibrium , such that @xmath103 .",
    "it is important to stress that , when the system is out of equilibrium the quantity @xmath104 should nt be regarded as the system s thermodynamic entropy , which is essentially an equilibrium property .",
    "thus @xmath104 is only one of the many possible out of equilibrium generalizations of entropy .",
    "what makes it special is that it proves effective in addressing the entropy principle .",
    "the present proof of the entropy principle is very close , in the approach and methods , to a result discussed recently by @xcite .",
    "they considered the following alternative formulation of the second law , which they attribute to kelvin ( w. thomson ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ thomson s formulation : no work can be extracted from a closed equilibrium system during a cyclic variation of a parameter by an external source .",

    "indeed that work has been a major source of inspiration for the present one . in this case one wants to study the following quantity : @xmath107 - tr [ h_i\\rho_i]\\ ] ] for a cyclic process .",
    "this means that the final hamiltonian is assumed to be equal to the initial one @xmath108 .",
    "thus : @xmath109 where @xmath110 are the eigenvalues of @xmath111 .",
    "these are ordered according to @xmath112 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath110 , play here the same role as the entropy eigenvalues @xmath113 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf - si ] ) .",
    "thus it is immediate to see that , under the assumption of decreasing probabilities ( [ eq : orderingprobabilities ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : w=0 ] ) holds quanto - mechanically .    in a subsequent work @xcite have extended this result to the case of possibly non cyclic transformation .",
    "they have found that @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the eigenvalues of the final hamiltonian , @xmath105 is the work actually performed on the system and @xmath116 is the work that would have been performed if the same transformation would have been carried adiabatically .",
    "the proof is formally equivalent to the one discussed here .",

    "( [ eq : w > tildaw ] ) and eq . ( [ eq : sf - si ] ) proves that the formulation of the second law as a principle of minimal work or as an entropy principle are _ equivalent_. in particular it is easily seen that : @xmath117 thus the two principles are equivalent .",
    "further , whenever one is violated , the other will be too .",
    "cases where the minimal work principle is violated because of level crossing are discussed by @xcite . in those case",
    "the entropy principle would be violated too .    the history behind this kind of quanto - mechanical proofs of the second law is relatively recent , and can traced back at lest to the works of @xcite and @xcite . due to the lack of a suitable quanto - mechanical analogue of entropy , though , the application of such quantal approaches has remained restricted to the analysis of statements that concern work , whose mechanical definition is quite straightforward . to the best of the author s knowledge , similar arguments and approaches have been previously proposed for addressing the entropy principle only in the relatively un - known work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite already proposed the quantum entropy operator in the form @xmath118 , but the connection with the generalized helmholtz theorem ( which has been introduced later @xcite ) was not made , neither the importance of the volume entropy as a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy for possibly low dimensional systems was recognized .",

    "( [ eq : w > tildaw ] ) .",

    "the employment of the quantum volume entropy improves quite a lot over previous attempts at explaining the entropy principle based on quantum entropies .",

    "the corresponding change in @xmath121 is non - negative @xcite .",
    "but this does not ensure that for any _ finite _ non - adiabatic transformation the change would be non - negative as required by clausius formulation .",
    "tolman s argument according to which any finite transformation could be reproduced by a sequence of many infinitesimal abrupt transformations each followed by the reaching of a canonical equilibrium does not seem to be tenable .",

    "thus if initially we had some accumulation of balls towards the left side of the box , we expect the final state to be more flat . if we look at the average value of @xmath33 or any other increasing function of @xmath33 , like for example @xmath113 , we would record an increase of such values .",
    "this is a mere consequence of the fact that initially we had an accumulation towards the left .",
    "if initially we have had an accumulation towards the right , again the shaking would flatten out the distribution , but this time we would see a decrease of the average value of @xmath33 and of @xmath158 . if instead the initial distribution were flat , we would see no change in those quantities .",
    "indeed it is quite easy to see that the sign of inequality ( [ eq : entropy - increase ] ) would be reversed if an increasing ordering of initial probability is assumed .",
    "therefore , for such subset of the set of all possible initial distributions , we actually have a law of entropy decrease !",
    "this reflects the fact that there is no asymmetry in the time evolution of the volume entropy operator .",
    "thus , in principle , it should be possible to observe a decrease of entropy if the initial equilibrium would be given by an _",
    "inverted population_. in other words , we should be able to observe an inverted second law of thermodynamics in _ negative temperature _ systems .",
    "indeed experimental evidence of this exists since the very pioneering works of pound , purcell and ramsey on spin systems @xcite .",
    "they observed that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` when a negative temperature spin system was subjected to resonance radiation , more radiant energy was given off by the spin system than was absorbed @xcite '' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this means that it is possible to extract work from a negative temperature system by means of a cyclic transformation .",
    "in other words , for negative temperature systems we already have experimental evidence that : @xmath159 because of the _ equivalence _ of the minimal work principle and the entropy principle , in this case we would also have : @xmath160 the fact that the law of entropy increase is overwhelmingly more often observed than its symmetrical law of entropy decrease is a consequence of the fact that positive temperatures are overwhelmingly more common than negative ones .",
    "the former in fact is the _ natural _ state of matter , whereas the second can only be created _ artificially _ and only in few very special cases .",
    "@xcite already pointed out that very strict conditions must be met for a system to be capable of negative temperatures : ( a ) the system must be at equilibrium ( b ) there must be an upper limit in the hamiltonian s spectrum ( c ) the system must be thermally isolated from the environment .",
    "the second requirement is very restrictive as most systems have an unbounded kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "also the requirement ( c ) is restrictive in the sense that thermal insulation can be achieved only approximately and for a certain amount of time . on the contrary the inevitable thermal contact of our system with its environment",
    "would eventually bring it to the monotonic decreasing gibbs state @xmath161 the latter describes the natural state of matter , and as such is the _",
    "inevitable _ initial condition of any thermodynamic experiment .",
    "thus the time asymmetry of the laws of thermodynamics arises at the level of the initial thermal equilibrium , rather than in the second law itself .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with the view expressed by @xcite , according to which the second law does not entail any time asymmetry .",
    "the origin of the arrow of time should be looked for , instead , in the minus first law of thermodynamics , namely the _ equilibrium principle _ @xcite .",
    "adopting an approach similar to those adopted previously to prove the thomson s formulation of the second law , here we have proved the entropy principle on the basis of quantum mechanics , for initial conditions characterized by decreasing probabilities .",
    "this completes a programme devoted to the study of the mechanical foundations of thermodynamics initiated with a previous work @xcite . that work addressed the equilibrium part of the second law ,",
    "whereas the present one addresses the out of equilibrium part .",
    "the key tool of investigation adopted in both studies is the volume entropy . here",
    "we have compared it to other quantum entropies and shown that it proves more effective in addressing the entropy principle .",
    "we discussed the equivalence of the entropy principle and thomson s principle and have seen that the entropy principle can be proved classically as well . the apparent time asymmetry expressed by",
    "the second law stems from the fact that initial decreasing probabilities are overwhelmingly more common and natural in ordinary experimental set - ups than increasing ones . indeed a reversed entropy principle can be observed in artificially prepared negative temperature systems ."
