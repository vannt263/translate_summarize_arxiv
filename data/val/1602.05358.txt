    "chaos synchronization appears in networks of interacting non - linear units @xcite . due to the finite velocity of signal transmission ,",

    ", interaction enforces synchronization . under certain circumstances ,",
    "even when the time delay is much larger than the internal time scale , the units lock to a common chaotic trajectory without any time shift @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been demonstrated both numerically and experimentally in small networks of nonlinear oscillators @xcite and coupled semiconductor lasers @xcite , and is of natural interest in the fields of neuroscience @xcite and secure communication @xcite . for any network of identical non - linear units with a single time delay ,",
    "the stability of chaos synchronization is determined by the maximum lyapunov exponent of a single unit with delayed feedback , and the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix .",
    "firstly , two chaotic regimes are possible depending on the scaling of the single unit lyapunov exponent , namely strong and weak chaos .",
    "synchronization is only possible in the regime of weak chaos , where the exponent is positive and scales inversely with the delay time @xcite .",
    "secondly , the stability of the synchronized trajectory is determined by the difference in magnitude between the largest and the second largest eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "if there is a gap , stable chaos synchronization is possible , otherwise it is ruled out .",
    "for example , a ring of nonlinear units with unidirectional bonds has no eigenvalue gap , hence it can not synchronize @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the number of synchronized groups , is determined by the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of the network loop lengths @xcite .",
    "complete synchronization is linked with a non - zero eigenvalue gap and is possible if @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , for @xmath1 , the network shows a pattern of @xmath2 synchronized groups , where units belonging to the same group are not connected to each other , only to units from other synchronization groups .",
    "this is called sublattice synchronization @xcite .",
    "the gcd condition is exact for networks with a single large delay time and is related to mixing of information between the units @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that it is also true for networks with multiple large delay times with a fixed ratio , as resonances between the delayed signals influence the stability of synchronization . while the problem of 2 coupled units is solved @xcite ,",
    "an analytic proof is still not available for general networks .",
    "nontheless , the extended gcd condition has been demonstrated in numerical simulations and in experiments on semiconductor lasers : in @xcite , two lasers interacting by transmitting their laser beams with a single delay time , become chaotic but can not synchronize at zero lag . when a second , twice as long delay time is added with beam splitters",
    ", the two lasers could synchronize to a common chaotic intensity .",
    "hence , adding the second delay time produced synchronization .",

    "firstly , complete and sublattice synchronization triggered by time delay resonance , as predicted by the gcd condition , are demonstrated analytically in networks of iterated maps .",
    "secondly , the scope of the gcd condition is investigated beyond chaos synchronization showing that time delay resonances also trigger high correlations among units in non - synchronizable networks .",

    "complete and sublattice synchronization are explained by means of the master stability function symmetries and we give special time delay ratios for which complete synchronization is not possible . in section [ s : phasemaps ] we study complete and sublattice synchronization induced by different time delay resonances in doubly connected rings of tent and bernoulli maps .",

    "aditionally , along the transverse modes @xmath29 , the msf should be negative , @xmath30 for all @xmath27 , to guarantee the stability of the synchronized state .    in this manuscript",

    "secondly , we study correlations in directed rings of coupled linear oscillators with noise , identifying correlation peaks for the time delay ratios predicted by the gcd condition .",
