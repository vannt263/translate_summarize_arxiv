    "over the past 50 years , many different techniques have been devised and employed to study strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "unfortunately , advantages of the successful attempts were usually outweight by their limitations . recently , because of the progress in computer technology , complex diagramatic approaches have received increased attention .",
    "although baym and kadanoff s @xmath1 derivability @xcite does not guarantee the physical validity of a theory , their framework enables the generation of conserving approximations which are guaranteed to satisfy a variety of ward identities . for these reasons , the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite has been intensively studied over the years .",
    "its major disadvantage however is that it represents a conserving approximation at the single - particle level only .",
    "thus , the physical validity of the approximation appears to be questionable as the vertices are either overestimated or underestimated and the pauli exclusion principle is not respected properly @xcite . in contrast , the parquet formalism @xcite introduced by de dominicis et al .  in 1964",
    "is a conserving approximation which is self - consistent also at the two - particle level and one may hope that it resolves at least some of the limitations flex has .",
    "unfortunately , it has extremely complicated structure and was , apart from applications to the anderson impurity model and the 1-d hubbard model with small system size @xcite , hitherto also computationally out of reach . to circumvent this limitation , bickers et al.introduced the so - called pseudo - parquet approximation @xcite which attempts to improve on the flex without introducing the complexity of the full parquet equations .",
    "but this approach fails to properly address the full frequency and momentum dependence of the scattering processes . only very recently ,",
    "due to the great advance of the parallel computing and the tremendous increase in computer memory , has it become possible to fully solve this approximation for the first time .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in part",
    "i we present the formalism and the resulting equations . in part ii , we discuss the algorithm and the numerical difficulties that arising .",
    "in part iii , we present first results obtained from the parquet approximation ( pa ) for the 2-dimensional hubbard model and their comparison to other conserving approximaton methods such as flex and self - consistent second - order approximation ( sc2nd ) .",
    "as a benchmark , we compare these results against the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) which provides a numerically exact result .",
    "standard perturbative expansions attempt to describe all the scattering processes as single- or two - particle feynman diagrams . in the single - particle formalism",
    "the self - energy describes the many - body processes that renormalize the motion of a particle in the interacting background of all the other particles . in the two - particle context , with the aid of the parquet formalism ,",
    "one is able to probe the interactions between particles in greater detail using the so - called vertex functions , which are matrices describing the two particle scattering processes .",
    "for example , the reducible two - particle vertex @xmath2 describes the amplitude of a particle - hole pair scattered from its initial state @xmath3 into the final state @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 represents a set of indices which combines the momentum @xmath6 , the matsubara frequency @xmath7 and , if needed , the spin @xmath8 and band index @xmath9 .    in general , depending on how particles or holes are involved in the scattering processes , one can define three different two - particle scattering channels .",
    "these are the particle - hole ( p - h ) horizontal channel , the p - h vertical channel and the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel . for the hubbard model , the spin degree of freedom",
    "further divides the particle - particle channel into triplet and singlet channels while the particle - hole is divided into density and magnetic channels .",
    "one can further discriminate the vertices according to their topology .",
    "starting from the reducible vertex @xmath10 introduced above , we may define the irreducible vertex @xmath11 corresponding to the subclass of diagrams in @xmath10 that can not be separated into two parts by cutting two horizontal green s function lines .",
    "similarly , the fully irreducible vertex @xmath12 corresponds to the subclass of diagrams in @xmath11 that can not be split into two parts by cutting two green s function lines in any channel .",
    "an illustration of these different types of vertices is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle produces the so - called crossing symmetries which in turn yield relationships between these vertices in the different channels .",
    "this enables us to reduce the independent channels defined for the theory to the particle - particle and the particle - hole horizontal channels .",
    "the parquet formalism assumes the complete knowledge of the fully irreducible vertices and provides a set of equations which are self - consistent at both the single- and two - particle levels .",
    "the connection between the single- and two - particle quantities is through the schwinger - dyson equation which connects the reducible vertex @xmath10 to the self - energy @xmath13 .",
    "it is an exact equation derived from the equation of motion and has the following form :    @xmath14    where g is the single - particle green s function , which itself can be calculated from the self - energy using the dyson s equation : @xmath15 here , the indices @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 combine momentum @xmath19 and matsubara frequency @xmath20 , i.e.  @xmath21 .",
    "the reducible and the irreducible vertices in a given channel are related by the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 for the density and magnetic channels respectively and @xmath24 for the singlet and triplet channels , and we are using the vertex ladders which are defined as : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the direct product of two single - particle green s functions and is defined according to the particle - particle or the particle - hole channel .    in a similar manner ,",
    "the irreducible vertex and the fully irreducible vertex are related by the parquet equation .",
    "this set of equations expresses the fact that the irreducible vertex in a given channel is still reducible in the other two channels .",
    "the parquet equation has the following form in the different channels :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    the bethe - salpeter and parquet equations are also exact and derived from the categorization of the feynman diagrams .",
    "the above discussion of the structure of the parquet formalism is far from being exhaustive and is merely intended to make the paper reasonably self - contained . for a more detailed description of the parquet formalism ,",
    "we refer the reader to bickers et al .",
    "our actual goal is to numerically solve these equations self - consistently for the hubbard model on a two dimensional cluster .",
    "the algorithm for this solution is described in the next section .",
    "the set of equations dicussed above are solved self - consistently as illustrated in the self - consistency loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : al ] .",
    "one starts with a guess of the single - particle green s function or self - energy .",
    "this can , for example , be taken from the second - order approximation .",
    "the reducible and the irreducible vertices are also initialized with the bare interaction .",
    "the self - consistency loop can then be described as follows :    1 .",
    "first we calculte the bare susceptibility @xmath31 which is given by the product of two green s functions 2 .   next this bare susceptibility",
    "is used to calculate @xmath10 through the bethe - salpeter equation 3 .",
    "we then proceed with updating the irreducible vertices @xmath32 by solving the parquet equation.this step requires the input of the fully irreducible vertex @xmath33 . in the context of the parquet approximation which we study here it is taken to be the bare interaction .",
    "it however can also be extracted from some more sophisticated methods .",
    "it is followed by a calculation of the new @xmath10 through the bethe - salpeter equation 5 .",
    "this value of @xmath10 is then used to update the self - energy through the schwinger - dyson equation 6 .",
    "the dyson s equation is solved for the green s function @xmath34 .",
    "this loop is repeated until convergence of the self - energy @xmath35 is achieved within a reasonable criterion .",
    "unfortunately , this loop becomes unstable when the strength of the coulomb interaction is increased or the temperature is lowered . as we believe that this instability is purely numerical in origin and related to the iterative nature of the algorithm , we have to extend the above scheme to account for this problem .",
    "for example , one possibility is to start with an overestimated self - energy and to damp it along with the irreducible vertex between two iterations according to : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are some damping parameters .",
    "another possibility is to rewrite the coupled bethe - salpeter and parquet equations in the form @xmath39 and apply a variant of a newton s root searching method .",
    "then we can take advantage of the existing linear solvers such as bicgs @xcite , gmres @xcite or the broyden algorithm @xcite .",
    "one major advantage that the parquet formalism has over exact diagonalization ( ed ) or quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is that it scales algebraically with the volume of the system in space - time for any choice of parameters including those that lead to a sign problem in qmc .",
    "the most time - consuming part of the formalism is the solution of the bethe - salpeter and the parquet equations , where the computational time scales as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the number of sites on the cluster and @xmath43 the number of matsubara frequencies .",
    "although the scaling is better than that of ed or qmc when the sign problem is severe , one can see that the complexity quickly grows beyond the capacity of usual desktop computers with incrasing system size , and large - scale supercomputer systems have to be employed .",
    "our parallel scheme and our data distribution are based on the realization that the bethe salpeter equation is the most time - consuming part of our calculation .",
    "one can easily see that it decouples nicely with respect to the bosonic momentum - frequency index @xmath18 .",
    "this enables us to distribute the vertices across processors with respect to this third index and to solve the bethe - salpeter equation with a local matrix inversion .",
    "however , this storage scheme puts a limit on the size of the problem that we can address . for a node with 2  gbytes of memory , the maximum value of @xmath44 that we can use if our variables are complex double precision is about @xmath45 .    unlike the bethe - salpeter equation",
    ", one can readily observe that the parquet equation does not decouple in terms of the third index .",
    "solving this equation requires a rearrangement of the matrix elements across processors and this is the communication bottleneck in the algorithm .",
    "the rearrangement is necessary to obtain the form of the vertex ladder @xmath46 or @xmath47 that is required in the parquet equation . for instance , in the @xmath48 channel , we need @xmath49 .",
    "this form of the vertex ladder is obtained by employing the three - step process described in the following equations : @xmath50    the first step in this transformation only moves data locally in memory .",
    "this does not require much time .",
    "the second step is actually just a 2d matrix transpose but with matrix elements spreading on many nodes .",
    "this is where communication across nodes is required .",
    "it is achieved by using the standard message passing interface ( mpi ) collective directives @xcite .",
    "the final step is also local and can equally be done very fast .",
    "in the following section , we will show the pa results for a @xmath51 hubbard cluster at half - filling .",
    "the calculations are done for @xmath52 and different temperatures .",
    "the calculations are performed for a finite number of matsubara frequencies @xcite . however , for the observables we calculated , such as the local moment and magnetic susceptibility in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] , we performed an extrapolation to an infinite number of frequencies so that the cutoff error in frequency is minimized . to see how good pa works for the lattice model , we use the dqmc result as the benchmark . in the dqmc calculation , @xmath53 is used and the combined statistical and systematic errors are smaller than the symbols used . to further compare pa to other approximations ,",
    "flex and self - consistent second - order results are also included .       for the three diagrammatic approaches and the dqmc . for this temperature , the pa result ( solid line ) looks very close to the dqmc one ( symbol solid line ) as compared to sc second - order ( dashed line ) or flex ( dash - dotted line ) . ]",
    "first , one can get a rough idea of how pa improves the accuracy of physical observables by comparing the single - particle green s function from different levels of approximation .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gtau ] are @xmath55 with @xmath56 calculated from the self - consistent second - order approximation , flex , pa and dqmc .",
    "the parquet result is significantly closer to the dqmc result than the second - order approximation and flex results as can readily seen from the figure .",
    "this confirms the intuition that one would get better results if the approximation is made on the vertex which is most irreducible .",
    "next we present results for the local magnetic moment defined as @xmath57where @xmath58 denotes the number operator for electrons of spin @xmath59 . in the context of a conserving approximation",
    ", it can be re - expressed in terms of the self - energy and the single - particle green s function as @xmath60where the trace sums over both the momentum and the frequency degrees of freedom .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] . among the three diagrammatic approaches ,",
    "the pa result comes closest to the dqmc one .",
    "if we look more carefully at the dqmc curve , we can find the existence of two humps .",
    "the hump at @xmath61 , which is well reproduced by the pa , designates the energy scale for the charge fluctuation , and is directly related to the suppression of charge double occupancy .",
    "the other hump beginning at @xmath62 is related to the virtual exchange interaction , @xmath63 between nearby spins .",
    "it is believed to be related to the synergism between the development of the long - range antiferromagnetic correlation and enhancement of the local moment . as a result ,",
    "a pseudogap is opened which increases the entropy of the system @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath64 can be estimated by noticing @xmath65 for the strong coupling limit and @xmath66 in the weak coupling limit @xcite .",
    "therefore it basically interpolates between these two limits for that @xmath52 is in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "this hump is not well captured by pa .",
    "the increasing importance of envelop - shape diagram contribution @xcite not included in pa is responsible for this deviation in the low temperature region .",
    "finally , we look at the uniform magnetic susceptibility which is defined as @xmath67 with magnetic moment defined as @xmath68    the @xmath69 from different approaches are presented in fig .",
    "fig : chi .",
    "the uniform magnetic susceptibility calculated from dqmc follows a nearly linear dependence on @xmath70 this mimics closely the curie - weiss law of weakly interacting moments and implies that the dominant effect in the system is the short range magnetic fluctuation .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath71 dependence of the local moment presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] .",
    "as the temperature still dominates over the spin energy scale of the system , it suppresses the long range fluctuation .    from this figure , the improvement of pa over the other two approximations is also easy to see .",
    "similar to the local moment , the difference between results from pa and dqmc at the low temperature region can be explained by the omission of envelop - shape diagrams in pa .",
    "we have presented the parquet formalism , pa method and in particular the implementation we use to solve large - sized problem .",
    "the preliminary application of pa on the @xmath51 hubbard cluster shows that it can yield better results than the self - consistent second - order or flex calculations .",
    "this is the first step in our work , next we are going to use the parquet formalism in the so - called multi - scale many - body ( msmb ) approach @xcite . within msmb ,",
    "correlations at different length scales are treated with different methods .",
    "the short length scales are treated explicitly with qmc methods , intermediate length scales treated diagrammatically using fully irreducible vertices obtained from qmc and long length scales treated at the mean field level .",
    "note that in this approach the fully irreducible vertex is approximated by a qmc calculation on a small cluster , while in pa it is approximated by the bare interaction .",
    "therefor this approach should provide superior results to the pa .",
    "another advantage is that it can also avoid the exponential increase of the computational cost as the system size increases , and thus can take full advantage of the most up - to - date computer resources available",
    ". we will combine it with the local density approximation ( lda ) to gain some predictive power from the first principle electronic structure calculation .",
