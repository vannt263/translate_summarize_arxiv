    "why the stars and galaxies are rotating ? what is the origin of the angular momentum ? it is known that the planets in our solar system show a remarkable scaling relation between the angular momentum @xmath1 and the mass @xmath2 for each planet , @xmath3 where the unit mass and the angular momentum are measured respectively by the planck mass @xmath4 g  and the reduced planck constant @xmath5erg@xmath6sec .",
    "only exceptions are the mercury and the venus whose rotations are locked with their orbital rotation around the sun . although the sun by itself deviates from the above scaling , the whole solar system is also on this line . because the relation eq.([jmplanets ] )",
    "holds for the conserved quantities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it strongly suggests some fundamental origin of the planet system .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we summarize our study and discuss on further extension and possible applications of it .",
    "we started our study from an interesting scaling law but @xmath7 within the cluster series .",
    "the same index is suggested for star series .",
    "see below . ]",
    "@xmath8 which holds for angular momentum @xmath1  and the mass @xmath2  of astronomical objects from the scale of planets toward that of clusters of galaxies . focussing on the cluster series , such as globular clusters , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , we extracted the nature of the fully non - linear stage of dark matter , after the formation of caustic surface , in analogy between sgs and the fluid turbulence .",
    "the essential kolmogorov laws were rederived from the fourier transformed navier - stokes equation and equations for sgs , by demanding the existence of a steady energy flow characterized by a single parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this is an analogue of the case of smoluchowski coagulation equation , which admits scaling solution by demanding the steady mass flow .",
    "then we tried to test our considerations in several cosmological observations , such as the velocity dispersion , mass - luminosity ratio , @xmath10 relation , power spectrum of density fluctuations , and the cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "they all point the concordant value for the constant energy flow per mass : @xmath11@xmath12sec@xmath13 .      1 .",
    "we would like to evaluate the energy flow @xmath9 for dm , which may be associated with the hierarchical coalescence process in which smaller clusters continuously form larger clusters .",
    "this process provides the bottom - up scenario for the formation of large scale structure especially in the cold dm model .",
    "we would like to check whether the value we used @xmath14@xmath15 $ ] is consistent with the hierarchical coalescence evolution of dm .",
    "roughly estimated , this accumulation rate of kinetic energy yields a galaxy within about @xmath16 years .",
    "if the above is the case for dm , then we would like to apply the same analysis to our planet system , which is also considered to have the coalescence evolution as its origin [ 35 ] .",
    "actually in the left half of figure [ fig3 ] , the planet and star systems seem to admit the fitting line with the same slope @xmath17 as the case for dm but with larger parameter value for @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that the appropriate value for @xmath18  becomes of order @xmath19 , which seems to be too large to be explained from a simple coalescence process as in the case for dm . some violent mechanism , which allow huge energy transfer rate or catastrophic coalescence , is expected in the case for planet formation process .",
    "3 .   in the fluid turbulence",
    ", there holds another relation often called kolmogorov 4/5 law @xmath20which is essential to explain the energy flow takes place from low frequency modes to high frequency modes on average .",
    "then what is the analogous relation for sgs and how is it relevant in the universe ?",
    "although we do not know the answer , it will be important to notice the fact that sgs [ 36 ] shares some common properties with the fluid turbulence [ 37 ] , such as the negative skewness and the exponential distribution function of the velocity - difference , etc .",
    "these common properties will be a good starting point for further discussion .",
    "4 .   it would be interesting if we could actually transform eq.(ftjeans2 ) into the smoluchowski form like eq.([smoluchowski ] ) which directly expresses the coalescence evolution of sgs .",
    "if this is the case , the possible scaling solution , which may asymptotically realize , may correspond to the schechter function [ 3 ] which has a typical form , @xmath21where @xmath22 represents the frequency of the object of luminosity @xmath23 . if the cosmological objects are formed after many coalescence processes , then the smoluchowski equation will be more appropriate than the press - schechter theory [ 3 ] , in which a single collapse determines the population of objects at the corresponding scale",
    ". if this is the case , the index @xmath24 for the kernel @xmath25 ( see just below eq.([smoluchowski ] ) ) should be about @xmath26 .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath27 seems to be a natural tail of the distribution which is gradually evolving without runaway coalescence .",
    "we could not complete the argument on the velocity - luminosity ( or mass ) relation [ 38 ] which holds within a single species of object , from our point of view .",
    "if we simply apply our argument for luminous objects , we would have , from @xmath28 , the luminosity @xmath29as a function of the velocity @xmath30 or the velocity dispersion @xmath31  at that scale , provided appropriate reference ratio @xmath32 is given .",
    "for dm , we have , from @xmath33 , the mass expression @xmath34on the other hand , several tight relations are obtained for each type of galaxies . for spiral galaxies , tally - fisher relation of the form eq.(lv - rel ) holds with the variation of index from 3 for b - band to 4 for k band observations . for elliptical galaxies , a tight relation on the fundamental plane",
    "is established , @xmath35const.@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average surface brightness .",
    "although we can simply apply our argument to yield @xmath38which is almost consistent with the above , we can not obtain the relation in the form of a plain among three independent parameters ; all quantities are functions of only @xmath39 in our case .",
    "the authors would like to thank osamu hashimoto , hidenori takahashi for relevant discussions on the turbulence , osamu iguchi , yasuhide sota , and tohru tashiro for discussion on the local virial relation , nozomi mori for the cosmic magnetic fields and dynamo theory , masaaki morita , hideaki mouri for turbulence and fate of cosmic vorticity , kiyotaka tanikawa for showing us his paper before publication and providing us relevant references on @xmath10 relation , takayuki tatekawa for higher - order density perturbation theories .",
