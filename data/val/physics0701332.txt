    "the study of the propagation of intense laser pulses in underdense plasmas is relevant to several highly advanced applications , including electron @xcite and ion acceleration @xcite , development of x- and @xmath0-ray sources @xcite , and fusion neutron production @xcite .",
    "it is also of fundamental interest , due to the variety of relativistic and nonlinear phenomena which arise in the laser - plasma interaction @xcite . among these , self - focusing and self - channeling of the laser pulse arise in this regime from the intensity dependence of the relativistic index of refraction @xcite .",
    "strong space charge electric fields are generated during the early stage of the propagation of a superintense laser pulse through an underdense plasma as the ponderomotive force acts on electrons , pushing them away from the axis .",
    "thus , for a transient stage the pulse may propagate self - guided in a charged channel @xcite , while the space - charge field in turn drags and accelerates the ions to mev energies@xcite .",
    "so far , experiments have provided evidence of channel formation and explosion using optical diagnostics  @xcite . or by detecting radially accelerated ions  @xcite , while a direct detection of the space - charge fields has not been obtained yet .",
    "the development of the the proton projection imaging ( ppi ) technique  @xcite has provided a very powerful tool to explore the fast dynamics of plasma phenomena via the detection of the associated transient electric field structures . the technique is based on the use of laser - accelerated multi - mev protons ( @xcite and references therein ) as a charged probe beam of transient electromagnetic fields in plasmas , a possibility allowed by the low emittance and high laminarity of the proton source  @xcite , as well as by its ultra - short duration and the straightforward synchronization with an interaction laser pulse . the experimental ppi implementation takes advantage from the broad energy spectrum of protons , since in a time - of - flight arrangement protons of different energy will probe the plasma at different times , and thus an energy - resolved monitoring of the proton probe profile allows to obtain single - shot , multi - frame temporal scans of the interaction  @xcite .",
    "ppi and the related `` proton deflectometry '' technique permit to gather spatial and temporal maps of the electric fields in the plasma , and therefore have proven to be an unique tool to explore the picosecond dynamics of laser - plasma phenomena  @xcite via the associated space - charge fields .    in this article",
    ", we report on an experiment using the ppi technique to study of the formation and subsequent evolution of a charge - displacement channel in an underdense plasma .",
    "these investigations have led to the first direct experimental detection of the transient electric fields in the channel , providing an insight of the fundamental physical processes involved .",
    "the comparison of the experimental data with two - dimensional ( 2d ) electromagnetic ( em ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations and a simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) electrostatic ( es ) pic model allows to characterize in detail the electric field dynamics at different stages of its evolution .",

    "the short pulses were preceded by an amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) pedestal of 300  ps duration and contrast ratio of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "one of the beams ( @xmath2 ) was directed to propagate through he gas from a supersonic nozzle , having a 2  mm aperture , driven at 50 bar pressure .",
    "the interaction was transversely probed by the proton beam produced from the interaction of the second cpa beam ( @xmath10 ) with a flat foil ( a @xmath7 thick au foil was typically used ) , under the point projection imaging scheme @xcite .",
    "the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig.[expt_setup](a ) . due to the bragg peak energy deposition properties of the protons ,",
    "the use of multilayered stacks of radiochromic film ( rcf ) detector permits energy - resolved monitoring of the proton probe profile , as each layer will primarily detect protons within a given energy range .",
    "this allows to obtain single - shot , multi - frame temporal scans of the interaction in a time - of - flight arrangement @xcite .",
    "the spatial and temporal resolution of each frame were of the order of a few @xmath11 , and of a few microns , respectively , while the magnification was 11 .",

    "the images ( a ) and ( b ) have been obtained from the same shot at an intensity @xmath14 , while ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to a shot with @xmath15 .",
    "the signal in the frames is mainly due to protons [ of energies e = 13 mev , 12.5 mev , 13 mev and 12 mev in ( a)-(d ) respectively ] reaching the bragg peak within their active layers .",

    "[ channel],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    this can be interpreted as the result of the expulsion of electrons from the central region .",
    "the central dark line observed at later times in the channel suggests that at this stage the radial electric field must change its sign , i.e. point inwards , at some radial position . as discussed below , this field inversion is related to the effects of ion motion .    due to multi - frame capability of the ppi technique with ps temporal resolution",

    "in order to unfold the physical mechanisms associated with the dynamics of the charged channel , a 1d es pic model in cylindrical geometry was employed , in which the laser action is modeled solely via the ponderomotive force ( pf ) of a non - evolving laser pulse .",

    "meanwhile , the force @xmath55 accelerates the ions producing a depression in @xmath40 around the axis [ see fig.[pic1d ] ( b ) ] ; at the end of the pulse ( @xmath56 ) we find @xmath57 [ see fig.[pic1d ] ( a ) ] , indicating that the ions have reached the electrons and restored the local charge neutrality . however , the ions retain the velocity acquired during the acceleration stage . for @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the position of the pf maximum , the force on the ions , and thus the ion final velocity , decrease with @xmath60 ; as a consequence , the ions starting at a position @xmath61 are ballistically focused towards a narrow region at the edge of the intensity profile , and reach approximately the same position ( @xmath62 ) at the same time ( @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 after the peak of the laser pulse ) ; here they pile up producing a very sharp peak of @xmath40 .",
