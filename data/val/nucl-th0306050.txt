    "the interest to electric dipole moments ( edm ) of elementary particles and more complex systems like nuclei and atoms exists since 1950 , when it was first suggested that there was no experimental evidence for symmetry of nuclear forces under parity transformation  @xcite .",
    "the interest was renewed after 1964 when it was discovered that the invariance under cp transformation , which combines charge conjugation with parity , is violated in @xmath2-meson decays .",
    "this provided a new incentive for edm searches . since the combined cpt transformation is expected to leave a system invariant , breakdown of cp invariance should be accompanied by t violation .",
    "thus , there is a reason to expect that p and t violating edms should exist at some level .    the experimental upper limit on the neutron edm is @xcite @xmath3 the measured value for the proton edm is @xcite @xmath4 and is compatible with zero .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit which is three order of magnitude weaker than the one for the neutron .",
    "the best upper limit on edm ever obtained was in an atomic experiment with @xmath0hg  @xcite .",
    "the result for the dipole moment of this atom is @xmath5 unfortunately , the implications of this result are somewhat less impressive , due to the electrostatic screening of the nuclear edm in this essentially coulomb system .",
    "the point is that in a stationary state of such a system , the total electric field acting on each particle must vanish .",
    "thus , an internal rearrangement of the system s constituents gives rise to an internal field @xmath6 that exactly cancels @xmath7 at each charged particle ; the external field is effectively switched off , and an edm feels nothing @xcite .",
    "still , some p and t odd component of the electrostatic potential survives due to final nuclear size .",
    "it is created by the next moment in the nuclear electric dipole density distribution .",
    "this is the schiff moment defined as @xcite @xmath8 the schiff moment generates a p and t odd electrostatic potential in the form @xmath9 interaction of atomic electrons with the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) produces an atomic dipole moment @xmath10 because of the contact origin of the potential , only the electrons in @xmath11 and @xmath12 atomic orbitals contribute to the dipole moment given by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the eq.([1 ] ) is valid for any system of point - like charges @xmath13 .",
    "let us split the sum in eq.([1 ] ) into the sum over coordinates of nucleons and the sum over coordinates of charges inside the nucleons : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a nucleon position and @xmath16 is the position of the @xmath17th charge inside the nucleon .",
    "combining the terms of the zeroth and first order in @xmath18 and using @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we obtain an expression for the schiff moment as a sum of two terms .",
    "the first of them is similar to ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 for a proton and zero for a neutron .",
    "the mean value of this operator is nonzero only in the presence of the parity- and time - invariance violating nucleon - nucleon interaction    the second term in the operator ( [ 1.1 ] ) is related to the internal dipole moments of the nucleons @xmath24    the previous calculations of the schiff moment of a heavy nucleus @xcite were performed in a simplified manner , without taking into account the residual interaction between a valence nucleon and the core nucleons .",
    "only recently more microscopic studies of the schiff moment of @xmath0hg @xcite and @xmath25ra @xcite appeared where effects of the core polarization with the effective forces for @xmath0hg and the octupole deformation for @xmath25ra based on skyrm - hartree - fock method were discussed . in this work",
    "we would like to concentrate on the nucleon edm contribution to the schiff moment of the @xmath0hg nucleus . in the picture of independent particle model only an edm of a valence nucleon",
    "contributes to the schiff moment . in case of @xmath0hg",
    "it is a neutron edm .",
    "however , when a residual quasiparticle interaction between the valence neutron and the protons in the core is taken into consideration , the proton edm contribution to the nuclear schiff moment becomes nonzero .",
    "we calculated this contribution using a random phase appriximation with effective forces . from the relation between the schiff moment and the electric dipole moment of the hg atom @xcite",
    "the new upper limit on the proton edm was obtained .",
    "in our calculations we used full single - particle spectrum including continuum .",
    "the single - particle basis was obtained using partially self - consistent mean - field potential of @xcite .",
    "the potential includes four terms .",
    "the isoscalar term is the standard woods - saxon potential @xmath26 with the parameters @xmath27 mev , @xmath28 fm , and @xmath29 fm .",
    "two other terms @xmath30 , and @xmath31 were obtained in a self - consistent way using two - body landau - migdal - type interaction of @xcite for the spin - orbit and isovector parts of the potential .",
    "the last term is the coulomb potential of a uniformly charged sphere with @xmath32 fm .",
    "the mean field potential obtained in this way produces a good fit for single particle energies and r.m.s .",
    "radii for nuclei in the region around @xmath33pb .",
    "the effects of the core polarization for a single particle operator can be treated by introducing a renormalized operator @xmath34 satisfying the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bare schiff moment operator given by ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 1a ] ) or ( [ 1b ] ) . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are single particle occupation numbers and energies . for static moments the external frequency @xmath39 .",
    "the value of the schiff moment is given by the diagonal matrix element of the z - component of the renormalized operator ( [ 11 ] ) between mean field states of the last unpaired nucleon with a maximal angular momentum projection .",
    "@xmath40    for the residual interaction @xmath41 we use the phenomenological landau - migdal interaction that has the form @xmath42\\delta({\\bf",
    "r}_1-{\\bf r}_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath43 300 mev @xmath44 .",
    "the values of the empirical interaction constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 are crucial for our calculations .",
    "the proton contribution is proportional to the proton - neutron interaction @xmath47 .",
    "the constant @xmath46 is determined from magnetic properties of nuclei and positions of gamow - teller resonances .",
    "its adopted value varies between @xmath48@xmath49 depending on details of the mean field potential used @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath45 is not so well defined .",
    "the magnetic moments and m1 transitions are to large extent isovector and they do not fix @xmath45 .",
    "an attempt to fix it from the structure of high spin states in @xmath33pb has been done in @xcite .",
    "they found that @xmath50 had to be used in order to reproduce the excitation energies of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states .",
    "another value @xmath53 was quoted in the review paper @xcite .",
    "the schiff moment operator can be presented in coordinate space in the form @xmath54 where we have introduced the set of linear independent tensor operators @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the vector spherical harmonic .",
    "for @xmath57 we have @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "for a spherical nucleus we can separate the angular variables and solve the obtained equations in coordinate space .",
    "the equations are @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the radial part of the schiff moment operator ( [ 1b ] ) multiplied by @xmath63 .",
    "the kernel of the integral equation @xmath64 was calculated by means of the green functions of the radial schrdinger equation .",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the radial wave functions , and @xmath69 are the occupation numbers .    the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) for @xmath70 are shown in fig.1 and 2 .    ; the dashed curve is the bare operator @xmath71.,width=302 ]    ; the dashed curve is @xmath72.,width=302 ]    figure 1 demonstrates the magnitude of the core polarization effects .",
    "repulsive residual interaction ( [ 15 ] ) leads to not very significant decrease of the mean value of the schiff moment .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial dependence of the proton contributions induced by the core polarization .",
    "note 1 order of magnitude difference in the scales in fig . 1 and 2 . the full curve in fig .",
    "2 is the radial dependence at the first operator @xmath73 and the dashed curve is the radial dependence at the second operator @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 changes sign inside the nucleus , therefore its mean value is smaller than the mean value of @xmath72 which is mostly negative inside the nucleus .",
    "the value of the schiff moment of @xmath0hg can be presented as a sum of proton and neutron contributions @xmath76 in table i we list the values @xmath77 and @xmath78 calculated for different combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .       from table [ tabr ]",
    "one can see that the uncertainties in @xmath77 and @xmath78 due to uncertainties in @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath79 the main contribution to @xmath77 and @xmath78 comes from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 1b ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the first term is only -0.7 @xmath80 in @xmath78 and 0.006 @xmath80 in @xmath77 .",
    "the constraint for the schiff moment of mercury nucleus from the experiment @xcite can be obtained using the results of ref .",
    "they calculated edm of an atom created by the nuclear schiff moment .",
    "for @xmath0hg they found @xmath81.\\ ] ] from eq.([exp ] ) we obtain the following upper bound for the schiff moment @xmath82 from eq .",
    "( [ sm ] ) we can give the following constraints for edm of nucleons : @xmath83 the constraint for the neutron edm is worse than the existing result @xmath84 @xcite , therefore , we shall not discuss it below . for proton edm the estimate ( [ an1 ] )",
    "is 1 order of magnitude lower than the existing experiment @xmath85 e cm @xcite . in these circumstances",
    "the question about a real theoretical accuracy of our approach becomes important .",
    "it is clear that the value @xmath86 cited in eq.([spsn ] ) does not reflects the real accuracy of the theory .",
    "it just came from the difference in adopted values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty appears from two sources .",
    "first , it is an uncertainty in the atomic calculations that couple the nuclear schiff moment and edm of an atom .",
    "we shall not discuss it here referring to the work @xcite .",
    "second , it is an uncertainty in calculations of the core polarization effects using rpa with effective forces .",
    "the latter can be estimated from the following considerations . using rpa with the effective forces we can fit different nuclear moments in one nucleus .",
    "then , in neighbor nuclei the calculated moments will differ from the data .",
    "this difference can be regarded as an uncertainty in the theory . in our experience",
    "this difference is of the order of 20% on the average , reaching sometimes the value of 30% @xcite . to be safe ,",
    "we can adopt a conservative 30% uncertainty in calculations of @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , instead of ( [ spsn ] ) we would prefer to write for @xmath77 @xmath87 since the error in ( [ sp ] ) is not statistical , we can not give a probability distribution for @xmath77 .",
    "if one takes @xmath88 as a minimal value of @xmath77 , then it gives the following value for the proton edm upper bound @xmath89    in summary , we calculated the contributions of the proton and neutron edm to the schiff moment of @xmath0hg .",
    "the effects of core polarization were accounted for in the scope of rpa with the effective residual forces .",
    "a new upper bound of the proton edm has been obtained from the upper bound on the atomic edm of @xmath0hg atom .",
