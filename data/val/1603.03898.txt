    "spatial modulation ( sm ) is emerging as a promising multi - antenna modulation scheme ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "sm uses multiple antenna elements but only one radio frequency ( rf ) chain at the transmitter .",
    "the single - rf chain feature of sm brings in several advantages including reduced rf hardware complexity , size and cost , no spatial interference , and simple detection at the receiver , while offering the capacity and diversity benefits of multi - antenna systems . in sm , only one antenna element is activated in a given channel use and a qam / psk symbol is sent on the activated antenna ; the remaining antenna elements remain silent .",
    "the index of the active antenna element also conveys information bits .",
    "it has been shown that sm can achieve better performance than spatial multiplexing ( smp ) under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) is a generalization of sm , where the transmitter uses multiple ( @xmath0 ) antenna elements and more than one ( @xmath1 ) rf chain @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 among the @xmath0 available antenna elements are activated in a given channel use , and @xmath1 qam / psk symbols are sent simultaneously on the active antennas .",
    "the indices of the @xmath1 active antennas also convey information bits .",
    "both sm and smp can be seen as special cases of gsm with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that for a given modulation alphabet and @xmath0 , there exists an optimum @xmath6 that maximizes the spectral efficiency @xcite .",
    "further , for the same spectral efficiency , gsm can perform better than both sm and smp @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which shows the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding for different configurations of mimo systems each with @xmath7 and same spectral efficiency of 8 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) .",
    "we can see that the ( 8,8,2)-gsm mimo system outperforms both the ( 8,8,1)-system ( i.e. , sm system ) and ( 8,8,8-system ( i.e. , smp system ) .",
    "this superior performance of gsm - mimo motivates us to study its capacity limits .",
    "while most studies on sm / gsm in the literature so far have focused mainly on performance analysis and receiver algorithms , capacity of sm / gsm systems remains to be studied .",

    "another contribution is the proposal of low complexity encoding ( i.e. , bits - to - gsm signal mapping ) and detection methods suited for gsm - mimo systems with large number of antennas and rf chains .",

    "figure [ sim1 ] presents a performance comparison between the proposed lamp detection , ml detection , and csr based detection for different @xmath246- gsm mimo systems with bpsk .",
    "it can be seen that the lamp performance is away from ml performance by about 3 db and 1.6 db for @xmath247- and @xmath240-gsm mimo systems , respectively , at @xmath248 ber .",
    "thus , the performance of lamp improves as the system dimensions increase . also , lamp detection performs better than the csr detection in @xcite  e.g. , by about 1.8 db at @xmath248 ber in @xmath240-gsm mimo system .",
    "figure [ sim2 ] presents a performance comparison between the lamp detection , mmse detection ( performed as @xmath249^{-1}{{\\bf h}}^h{{\\bf y}}$ ] ) , csr detection in @xcite for the following large - scale gsm - mimo system configurations : ( @xmath34 ) @xmath250-gsm , 4-qam , @xmath251 , @xmath252 bpcu , ( @xmath253 ) @xmath242-gsm , 4-qam , @xmath254 , @xmath255 bpcu , and ( @xmath256 ) @xmath241-gsm , 4-qam , @xmath257 , @xmath258 bpcu .",
    "it can be seen that the proposed lamp algorithm performs better and its performance improves as the dimensionality of the gsm signal increases .    in fig .",
    "[ sim3 ] , we plot the average snr required by the lamp detection algorithm to achieve a target ber of @xmath259 as the number of receive antennas @xmath5 is varied .",
    "we consider two gsm mimo systems here , ( @xmath34 ) @xmath260 , 4-qam , @xmath252 bpcu , and ( @xmath253 ) @xmath261 , 4-qam , @xmath262 bpcu . from fig .",
    "[ sim3 ] , it can be seen that as @xmath5 increases the snr required to achieve the target ber reduces .",
    "it can also be observed that the lamp detection algorithm performs well even when the system is underdetermined , i.e. , @xmath263 .",
    "this is because the lamp detection algorithm exploits the sparse structure of the gsm transmit signals to efficiently perform detection .     as the number of receive antennas @xmath5 is varied for @xmath264 , and @xmath265 gsm mimo systems with 4-qam.,width=336,height=249 ]",
    "we studied gsm mimo capacity and low complexity methods for gsm encoding and detection .",
    "we made the following key contributions in this paper : 1 ) we derived lower and upper bounds on the gsm mimo capacity , 2 ) we proposed an efficient gsm encoding method using combinadics for large number of transmit antennas and rf chains , and 3 ) we also proposed a message passing based low - complexity detection algorithm suited for large - scale gsm mimo systems .",
