    "the thermodynamics of asymptotically anti de - sitter ( aads ) black holes has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "first this is due to the fact that it produces an aggregate of ideas from thermodynamics , quantum field theory and general relativity , and second because of its role in the ads / cft duality @xcite . according to this duality the low energy limit of string theory in aads ( times some compact manifold ) is equivalent to quantum field theory living on the boundary of aads .",
    "this equivalence between the two formulations means that , at least in principle , one can obtain complete information on one side of the duality by performing a computation on the other side .",
    "for example , one can gain some insight into the thermodynamic properties and phase structures of strong t hooft coupling conformal field theories by studying the thermodynamics of aads black holes .",
    "an interesting application of the ads / cft correspondence is the interpretation of hawking - page phase transition between thermal ads and aads black hole as the confinement - deconfinement phases of the yang - mills ( dual gauge ) theory defined on the ads boundary @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is now a fundamental concept that furnishes a means for calculating the action and thermodynamic quantities intrinsically without reliance on any reference spacetime @xcite .",
    "it has extended to the case of asymptotically de sitter spacetimes @xcite . although the ( a)ds / cft correspondence applies for the case of a specially infinite boundary , it was also employed for the computation of the conserved and thermodynamic quantities in the case of a finite boundary @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has also been applied for the case of black objects with constant negative or zero curvature horizons @xcite .    for aads spacetimes ,",
    "the presence of a negative cosmological constant makes it possible to have a large variety of black holes / branes , whose event horizons are hypersurfaces with positive , negative , or zero scalar curvatures @xcite .",
    "the aads rotating solution of einstein s equation with cylindrical and toroidal horizon and its extension to include the electromagnetic field have been considered in ref .",
    "the generalization of this aads charged rotating solution of einstein - maxwell s equation to the higher dimensions has been done in ref .",
    "many authors have been considered thermodynamics and stability conditions of these black holes @xcite . in this paper , we study the phase behavior of the charged rotating black branes in @xmath1 dimensions with zero curvature horizon and show that there is no hawking - page phase transition in spite of the angular momentum of the branes .",
    "this is in commensurable with the fact that there is no hawking - page phase transition for black object whose horizon is diffeomorphic to @xmath2 ( @xmath3-brane solution ) and therefore the system is always in the high temperature phase @xcite . according to the ads / cft dictionary , this means that the corresponding field theory , which now lives on @xmath4 , has no phase transition as a function of temperature in the large @xmath5 limit .",

    "the ads / cft correspondence states that if the metric near the conformal boundary ( @xmath17 ) can be expanded in the aads form @xmath18 with nondegenerate metric @xmath19 , then one may remove the non logarithmic divergent terms in the action by adding a counterterm action @xmath20 which is a functional of the boundary curvature invariants . it is worthwhile to mention that the induced metric on the boundary is @xmath21 where @xmath22 . the counterterm for asymptotically ads spacetimes up to seven dimensions is @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the ricci scalar , riemann , and ricci tensors of the boundary metric @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the step function which is equal to one for @xmath29 and zero otherwise .",
    "although other counterterms ( of higher mass dimension ) may be added to @xmath20 , they will make no contribution to the evaluation of the action or hamiltonian due to the rate at which they decrease toward infinity , and we shall not consider them in our analysis here .",
    "these counterterms have been used by many authors for a wide variety of the spacetimes , including schwarzschild - ads , topological schwarzschild - ads , kerr - ads , taub - nut - ads , taub - bolt - ads , and taub - bolt - kerr - ads @xcite .",

    "<S> we compute the euclidean actions of a @xmath0-dimensional charged rotating black brane both in the canonical and the grand - canonical ensemble through the use of the counterterms renormalization method , and show that the logarithmic divergencies associated with the weyl anomalies and matter field vanish . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a smarr - type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy , the angular momenta , and the electric charge , and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . using the conserved quantities and the euclidean actions , we calculate the thermodynamics potentials of the system in terms of the temperature , angular velocities , and electric potential both in the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a stability analysis in these two ensembles , and show that the system is thermally stable . </S>",
    "<S> this is commensurate with the fact that there is no hawking - page phase transition for a black object with zero curvature horizon . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtain the logarithmic correction of the entropy due to the thermal fluctuation around the equilibrium . </S>"
