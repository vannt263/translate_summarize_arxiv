    "the properties of low - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin systems have been subject of many studies in recent years .",
    "a lot of activity in this area was stimulated by the possible connection of such systems with the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "but , the rather unusual properties of quantum magnets deserve study on their own to gain a deeper understanding of these quantum many - body systems , especially at low temperatures .",
    "one of the main issues studied is the presence of long - range order ( lro ) in the ground state of two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets ( haf ) , described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 on different two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors on the lattice under consideration and the coupling @xmath6 is positive .",
    "it is rather well established that lro is present in the ground state of the spin-@xmath0 haf on bipartite lattices ( square @xcite , honeycomb@xcite , 1/5-depleted square@xcite , square - hexagonal - dodecagonal@xcite ) and , contrary to some early works@xcite , also on triangular lattice@xcite .",
    "those results were obtained and confirmed by different methods : exact diagonalization ( ed ) , monte - carlo simulations , spin - wave and variational approaches , series expansions and others .",
    "it is also worth noticing that recent experiments show that real systems can be modeled by spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets with different couplings on some uniform @xcite and even depleted lattices @xcite .    a regular depletion of the triangular lattice by a factor of 1/4 yields the kagom lattice with coordination number @xmath2=4 .",
    "contrary to the triangular lattice the ground state of the spin-@xmath0 haf on the kagom lattice is most likely a spin liquid.@xcite however , the kagom lattice is not the only regularly depleted triangular lattice .",
    "as recently has been pointed out by betts @xcite a regular depletion of the triangular lattice by a factor of 1/7 yields another translationally invariant lattice .",
    "the coordination number of this lattice is @xmath1 and lies between those of the triangular ( @xmath3 ) and the kagom ( @xmath4 ) lattices .",
    "according to betts we will call this lattice in what follows the maple leaf lattice . since ,",
    "in general , magnetic order is weakened by frustration and low coordination number @xmath2 , it is natural to ask whether the magnetic lro , present for the haf on triangular lattice but absent for the haf on kagom lattice , will survive this 1/7 depletion of the triangular lattice or not . in this paper",
    "we will study this problem using several analytical and numerical methods to calculate the ground state of model ( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly illustrate the geometrical properties of the lattice and the classical magnetic ground state , in section iii exact diagonalization data for finite lattices of @xmath7 and @xmath8 spins are presented and compared with approximate data ( spin - wave and variational ) , in section iv a linear spin - wave approach to this problem is presented , results of variational calculations are described in section v , and the summary is given in section vi .",
    "the maple leaf lattice is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it belongs to the class of uniform tilings in 2d built by a periodic array of regular polygons . in each of the equivalent sites 4 triangles and one hexagon meet .",
    "the maple leaf lattice has no reflection symmetry .",
    "its unit cell ( marked by dashed lines in fig.[fig1 ] ) consists of 6 sites and 15 bonds .",
    "the underlying bravais lattice is a triangular one .",
    "the basis vectors are @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the distance between neigboring sites .",
    "more information can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the ground state of a classical spin system on such a lattice forms the starting point for the calculation of the ground state properties of the quantum haf within the spin - wave method ( section iv ) and variational method ( section v ) .",
    "as reported previously@xcite , this ground state is a non - collinear ( canted ) planar state with six sublattices . it can be characterized as follows : we denote the position of @xmath12-th hexagon ( unit cell ) by lattice vector @xmath13 and label the sites in the unit cell by the running index @xmath14",
    ". then we can write @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are arbitrary orthogonal unit vectors .",
    "for the angles @xmath18 we have + @xmath19 for nearest neighbors on the hexagon within the unit cell .",
    "the corresponding product of two spin vectors reads @xmath20 the classical ground state corresponds to two sets of wave vector * q * and pitch angle @xmath21 , namely @xmath22 ,   \\alpha_1=-\\frac{5}{6}\\pi \\;$ ] and @xmath23 ,   \\alpha_2=\\frac{5}{6}\\pi$ ] .",
    "this is a kind of trivial degeneracy which one can also encounter in the system of classical spins residing on the triangular lattice .",
    "the classical ground state energy is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of sites .",
    "for spin @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we have the energy per bond @xmath28 .",
    "notice that for the haf on triangular and kagom lattices @xmath29 .",
    "the classical ground state for @xmath30 is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "one has six triangular sublattices a , b, ... ,f .",
    "the classical spins attached to the sublattices are rotated from one unit cell to the next one by the angle @xmath31 in the direction of basis vector @xmath32 and by the angle @xmath33 in the direction of @xmath34 .",
    "the angle between the nearest spins on each hexagon is @xmath35 or @xmath36 and three spins residing on each equilateral triangle ( marked by light and dark grey in fig.[fig1 ] ) coupled to three nearest hexagons form a @xmath37-structure .",
    "though the classical ground state of the maple leaf lattice is more complex than that of the triangular lattice both are nel states , however , with more than two sublattices . at the same time",
    "the classical ground state properties of the kagom lattice exhibiting a nontrivial ground state degeneracy are completely different .",
    "we used the lanczos algorithm to calculate the lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenstate of finite lattices of @xmath38 sites .",
    "this method has sucessfully applied to finite triangular and kagom lattices .",
    "unfortunatly , for the maple leaf lattice only the lattice with @xmath7 has the complete p6-symmetry of the infinite lattice and only multiples of 18 fit to the symmetry of the classical ground state .",
    "hence we focus on the lattices with @xmath7 and @xmath39 shown in fig.[fig2 ] . to reduce the hilbert space of the hamiltonian we use all possible translational and point symmetries as well as spin reflection .",
    "the number of symmetries of the @xmath39 lattice is lower than that of corresponding @xmath39 triangular and kagom lattices and the number of symmetrized basis in the @xmath40 ground state sector is 378,221,361 .",
    "the ground state energy per bond for @xmath7 is @xmath41 and for @xmath39 is @xmath42 .",
    "the spin - spin correlation functions for @xmath7 are collected in table [ tab1 ] and for @xmath39 in table [ tab2 ] where they are compared to those obtained within spin - wave and variational approach ( see below ) . in the fully symmetric @xmath7 lattice",
    "we have three different nearest - neighbor ( nn ) correlations .",
    "the nn correlation @xmath43 ( solid lines in fig.[fig2 ] ) corresponds to the classical @xmath37 bond ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) ; the respective averaged value for @xmath39 is @xmath44 .",
    "both values are very close to the nn correlation for the triangular lattice .",
    "the nn correlation along a hexagon ( dashed lines in fig.[fig2 ] ) is strong @xmath45 ( the respective averaged value for @xmath39 is @xmath46 ) and is close to the nn correlation of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "finally , the nn correlation corresponding to a classical @xmath47 bond ( dotted lines in fig.[fig2 ] ) is very small @xmath48 ( the respective averaged value for @xmath39 is @xmath49 ) .",
    "hence the nn correlations of the quantum system reflect very well the classical ground state .",
    "the finite - system order parameter corresponding to the classical ground state is the structure factor ( square of sublattice magnetization ) @xmath50 the values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are listed in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "a finite - size scaling of the order parameter with only two points seems to be not reasonable , however , doing so with a @xmath51 scaling we obtain a finite value of @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "a better way is the direct comparison of the spin - spin correlations with those for the haf on triangular and kagom lattices@xcite . for the presentation of the data we have to take into account that in the classical six - sublattice nel state we have for instance spins with a relative angle of @xmath47 leading to special correlations being zero for arbitrary distances .",
    "therefore we consider as a measure for magnetic order the strongest correlations .",
    "consequently we present in fig.[fig3]a the maximal absolute correlations @xmath54 versus euclidian distance @xmath55 .",
    "as expected we have very rapidly decaying correlations for the disordered kagom case , whereas the correlations for the nel ordered triangular lattice are much stronger for larger distances . though the correlations for the maple leaf lattices are smaller than those of the triangular lattice they are significantly stronger than those of the kagom lattice and a kind of saturation for larger distances is suggested .",
    "the results for the spin - spin correlation are used to estimate the quality of the spin - wave and variational method used below by comparing the exact and approximate correlations @xmath54 for the finite lattice of @xmath39 ( fig.[fig3]b ) .",
    "taking into account that we have six sites in the geometrical unit cell the appropriate representation of the general hamiltonian ( [ eq0 ] ) reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 label the unit cells and @xmath58 the different sites in one unit cell .",
    "of course , the sum runs over neighboring sites , only . the linear spin - wave theory ( lswt )",
    "is carried out as usual .",
    "however , we need at least six different types of magnons , which makes the calculation more ambitious than for the triangular or the kagom lattice . we use as quantization axis the local orientation of the spins in the classical ground state . performing the linear holstein - primakoff transformation the scalar product @xmath59 in ( [ eq0a ] ) ) is replaced by the bosonic quadratic form @xmath60 where @xmath58 label the different magnons in a unit cell @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath61 represents the angle between the respective classical spin vectors . after transforming the hamiltonian ( [ eq0a ] ) into the @xmath62-space one obtains @xmath63 where @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and with @xmath11 being the distance between two neighboring spins",
    "this hamiltonian can be diagonalized by the bogoljubov transformation @xmath69 the new bosonic operators @xmath70 describe the normal modes @xmath71 . in order to determine them and the bogoljubov coefficients one has to solve the following equations @xmath72_{-}=\\omega_{m{\\bf",
    "k}}\\alpha_{m{\\bf k}}\\quad,\\quad   \\left[\\alpha_{m-{\\bf k}}^{+},h\\right]_{-}=-\\omega_{m{\\bf k}}\\alpha_{m-{\\bf k}}^{+}. \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] the solution gives six different , non - degenerated spin - wave branches  five of them are optical whereas the remaining one is an acoustical branch .",
    "the acoustical branch becomes zero in the center ( @xmath73 ) and at the edges of the brillouin zone ( @xmath74 with @xmath75 $ ] ) .",
    "the expansion of the zero modes in the vicinity of those points gives the spin - wave velocities @xmath76 the acoustical branch of the maple leaf lattice is similar to that of the haf on the triangular lattice@xcite , where one has a threefold degenerated acoustical branch being zero for @xmath73 and at the edges of the brilloiun zone @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the situation for the haf on the kagom lattice is completely different .",
    "starting from the so - called classical @xmath73 state one obtains three branches , one dispersionsless ( flat ) mode @xmath78 and two degenerated acoustical branches @xcite .    in analogy to the triangular lattice@xcite it can be shown that the zero modes @xmath79 of the maple leaf lattice describe out - of - plane and in - plane oscillations , respectively .",
    "therefore , we denote @xmath80 as @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 .",
    "together with the spin - wave velocity the spin stiffness constitutes the fundamental parameters which determine the low - energy dynamics of magnetic systems @xcite . to calculate the spin stiffness @xmath84 in the leading order @xmath85",
    "one can use the hydrodynamic relation @xmath86 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibilities @xmath87 ( out - of - plane ) and @xmath88 ( in - plane ) can be determined minimizing the classical energy in the limit of a vanishing external field .",
    "we find @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 as the volume of the lattice and from the hydrodynamic relation one obtains @xmath92 the comparison with the corresponding parameters calculated in the same order in @xmath93 for the square and the triangular lattice are given in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "we find that the spin stiffness parameters for the maple leaf lattice are lower than the corresponding values of the triangular lattice indicating that the nel is stronger influenced by quantum fluctuations in the maple leaf lattice than in the triangular one .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 which leads in the thermodynamic limit to an energy per bond @xmath96 the sublattice magnetization @xmath97 calculated in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath98 a comparison between all those values for haf on square , triangular and maple leaf lattices is given in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "obviously , for all these parameters @xmath99 , @xmath84 and @xmath100 the same tendency is found , namely to be largest for the unfrustrated lattice and to be lowest for the frustrated maple leaf lattice with @xmath1 .",
    "notice , that for the kagom lattice the lswt yields divergent contributions in the sum over @xmath101 in @xmath102 indicating a vanishing sublattice magnetization @xcite .",
    "finally , we compare the spin - spin correlations @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 runs over all spins in the system ) obtained within the lswt for the finite lattice with @xmath39 shown in fig.[fig2 ] with the exact numerical lanczos data ( see fig.[fig3]a and table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "one finds a surprisingly good agreement between the approximative lswt data and the exact lanczos data .",
    "hence the finding of finite sublattice magnetization obtained within lswt is supported by the lanczos data .",
    "the classical ground state , described in section ii , is the basis for the construction of the variational huse - elser @xcite ground state which , expanded in the ising basis states @xmath105 of the total spin component @xmath106 @xcite , reads @xmath107 the operators @xmath108 are diagonal in the base @xmath109 .",
    "the term @xmath110 produces a proper classical phase for a given state @xmath109 in the expansion given by eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "the sum runs over all spins in the system ( i.e. the index @xmath104 corresponds to a pair @xmath111 of indices in eqs .",
    "( [ order ] ) and ( [ eq0a ] ) .",
    "@xmath112 is the angle specified in fig.[fig1 ] .    the second operator containing variational parameters @xmath113 @xmath114 provides the amplitude for a given basis state @xmath109 and introduces the quantum corrections to the classical function by taking into account spin - spin correlations .",
    "it means that in this approach one starts from the state with a broken rotational symmetry and this is still present during the minimization procedure producing the final symmetry - broken ordered state @xcite .",
    "finally , the third operator which contains the variational parameter @xmath115 and the corresponding sign factors @xmath116 @xmath117 describes an additional possible change of the classical phase due to the quantum fluctuations . following the ideas of huse and elser @xcite",
    "we assume that the wave function of the quantum ground state ( i.e. @xmath118 from eq . ( [ eq17 ] ) with all three terms @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) has the same symmetry properties as its classical part ( i.e. @xmath118 from eq . ( [ eq17 ] ) with only @xmath119 ) : the sign of the imaginary part of the wave function changes under the rotation @xmath122 by the angle @xmath123 whereas remains unchanged under the rotation @xmath124 by the angle @xmath125 about the center of a hexagon .",
    "this transformation determines the shape of three - spin terms @xmath115 and the proper sign of @xmath116 in eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) . similarly to the triangular lattice @xcite the most simple three - spin terms are dog legs with @xmath104 and @xmath126 being nearest neighbors of @xmath127 . for example , for spin number 5 of the @xmath7 lattice shown in fig .",
    "2 ( top ) there exist four such interactions : @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "each @xmath130 is connected with its corresponding @xmath131 factor , i.e. @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , where the letters a , b , c , d , e , f correspond to the 6 equivalent triangular sublattices illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . taking into account that @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , i.e. , the @xmath37 structure ace ( dark triangles in fig .",
    "1 ) transforms into @xmath37 structure bdf ( grey triangles in fig .",
    "1 ) under @xmath122 or into itself under @xmath140 one obtains a proper signs of @xmath131 factors @xmath141 the index @xmath142 means that two ( different ) spins in the three - spin term belong to the same @xmath37 structure , the remaining one belongs to the other @xmath37 structure. thus , for example , if one puts @xmath143 it follows that @xmath144 ( or @xmath145 and @xmath146 , see fig .",
    "2 ) .    how does one choose the variational parameters @xmath113 and @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) for the haf on the maple leaf lattice ?",
    "we have applied two criteria : a better choice of parameter space should give a lower value of the ground state energy and , if two energies for different parameter spaces are approximately the same , one should choose the parameter space which leads a lower value of the variance @xmath147 . in order to find an optimal choice of the wave function",
    "we have tested some possibilities for the parameter space for the fully symmetrical @xmath7 lattice taking into account the whole @xmath106 basis in the expansion ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "the best choice found is the following five - parameter space ( results for the correlation are collected in table i ) : @xmath148 . spins interacting _ via _ @xmath149 are nearest neighbors lying on a hexagon : _ hex _",
    "= ab , bc , cd , ... , fa , those interacting _ via",
    "_ @xmath150 are nearest neighbors belonging to the @xmath37 structure : _ tr _",
    "= ec , ca , ae or bf , fd , db ; and all remaining nearest neighbors are coupled by @xmath151 , thus _ others _",
    "= be , bc , ef .",
    "note that there is no long - range variational parameter for pairs of spins not being the nearest neighbors .",
    "moreover , one takes into account only three , from the four existing dog leg interactions , i.e. , dog legs around a hexagon are absent .",
    "for example , in each point f one has @xmath152 and @xmath153 and @xmath154 is absent ( or correpondingly for spin number 5 in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 and @xmath157 is absent ) .",
    "all the expectation values of operators reported in the following are calculated for this choice of the variational parameters .",
    "having obtained the ground state function one can calculate the expectation values of the operators which characterize the ground state of a given , finite spin system .",
    "this can be accomplished by a monte - carlo approach@xcite and the finite size scaling @xcite tells how to extrapolate those expectation values to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have investigated the finite systems of 18 , 72 , 162 , 288 spins with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "note that they have the full symmetry of the maple leaf lattice .",
    "the relevant quantities are collected in table [ tab4 ] and the finite size analysis is presented in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the leading term of the finite - size correction of the ground state energy per bond @xmath158 is @xmath159 .",
    "the data in table [ tab4 ] can be fitted to this dependence ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) and hence the energy per bond @xmath160 in the thermodynamic limit is obtained : @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "this value for @xmath160 is about 3% higher than the value obtained from spin - wave theory ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) ) .    in fig.[fig5 ] the finite - size extrapolation of the square of sublattice magnetization defined in eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) is shown .",
    "we find @xmath164 with @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 suggesting that the long - range magnetic order persists in the ground state of this spin system .",
    "note , however , that the applied variational ansatz tends to overestimate the magnetic order ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and table [ tab2 ] as well as fig.[fig3]a ) .",
    "the variational approach enables us to calculate the spin gap @xmath168 , where @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) is the variational energy in the subspace of total @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "this new aspect of the huse - elser ansatz was used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the spin gap for the haf on the square - hexagonal - dodecagonal lattice .",
    "magnetic lro is connected with gapless goldstone modes whereas quantum disorder in the ground state is accompanied by a finite spin gap .",
    "therefore the calculation of @xmath173 yields an additional argument for or against the existence of magnetic lro order in the ground state .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] shows the finite - size extrapolation of the spin gap according to the relation @xmath174 with @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the negative @xmath177 is a result of the limitted accuracy of the approximation but nevertheless suggests a zero spin gap .",
    "hence we have an additional indication for the existence of lro .",
    "in this paper the results of exact diagonalization , linear spin - wave theory and a huse - elser like variational investigation for the ground state of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a new 1/7-depleted triangular ( maple leaf ) lattice are presented .",
    "the coordination number of this frustrated lattice @xmath1 lies between those of the triangular and the kagom lattices .",
    "quantum fluctuations and frustration tend to destroy classical magnetic ordering .",
    "their influence becomes the stronger the smaller the coordination number .",
    "but contrary to the kagom lattice with @xmath4 for the maple leaf lattice we find strong arguments that the classical six - sublattice nel lro survives the strong quantum fluctuations present in this frustrated quantum magnet .",
    "this conclusion is drawn from the calculated values of the spin - spin correlation , sublattice magnetization , spin stiffness , spin - wave velocity as well as the spin gap .",
    "the comparison between exact data and approximate data for the spin - spin correlation on finite lattices gives a surprising well agreement between the linear spin - wave and the exact - digonalization data whereas the variational approach tends to overestimate the strength of correlations .",
    "finally , we mention that on the passage from the triangular to the 1/7 depleted ( maple leaf ) lattice ( i.e. , some interactions @xmath6 in spin system on triangular lattice are varied from @xmath27 to @xmath178 ) , one would encounter a transition between three - sublattice and six - sublattice nel lro which may have interesting features worth to be considered in future . + * acknowledgement *    we acknowledge support from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( projects no . ri 615/10 - 1 and 436pol 17/5/01 ) and from the polish committee for scientific research ( project no .",

    "<S> a linear spin - wave approach , a variational method and exact diagonlization are used to investigate the magnetic long - range order ( lro ) of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two - dimensional 1/7-depleted triangular ( maple leaf ) lattice consisting of triangles and hexagons only . </S>",
    "<S> this lattice has @xmath1 nearest neighbors and its coordination number @xmath2 is therefore between those of the triangular ( @xmath3 ) and the kagom ( @xmath4 ) lattices . calculating spin - spin correlations , sublattice magnetization , spin stiffness , spin - wave velocity and spin gap </S>",
    "<S> we find that the classical 6-sublattice lro is strongly renormalized by quantum fluctuations , however , remains stable also in the quantum model . </S>"
