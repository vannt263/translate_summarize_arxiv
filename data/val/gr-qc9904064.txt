    "the study involved in the attempt to detect gravitational waves represents one of the most exciting field in modern physics . the detection will provide a decisive test of general relativity and open a new window for astrophysical observation . unfortunately , in spite a great deal of effort , no one has yet succeeded in the detection of the gravitational waves . however ground - based laser interferometers , such as ligo,@xcite virgo,@xcite tama@xcite and geo600,@xcite",
    "are being constructed and will soon enter a stage of data taking .",
    "strong sources of gravitational waves should be regions where gravity is general relativistic and where the velocities of bulk motion are near the speed of light .",
    "many researchers have theoretically investigated coalescing and colliding black holes and neutron stars as candidates for detection .",
    "in addition , gravitational waves emitted during stellar collapse to black holes have been studied by perturbative calculations of a spherically symmetric background.@xcite  because of the existence of event horizon , the emitted gravitational waves are dominated by the quasi - normal modes of the schwarzschild black hole in the asymptotic region .",
    "some other realistic candidates exist , e.g. , supernovae , rapidly rotating neutron stars , relic gravitational waves of the early universe , stochastic gravitational waves from cosmic strings , and so on .",
    "in this paper we attempt to investigate whether a naked singularity , if such exists , is a strong source of gravitational radiation , and , moreover , to understand the dynamics and observational meaning of naked singularity formation .",
    "several researchers have shown that the final fate of gravitational collapse is not always a singularity covered by an event horizon .",
    "for example , in the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) spacetime,@xcite a naked shell - focusing singularity appears from generic initial data for spherically symmetric configurations of the rest mass density and a specific energy of the dust fluid.@xcite the initial functions in the most general expandable form have been considered.@xcite   the matter content in such a spacetime may satisfy even the dominant energy condition . in this case with a small disturbance of the spacetime , very short wavelength gravitational waves , which are created in the high density region around a singularity , may propagate to the observer outside the dust cloud because of the absence of an event horizon . if this is true , extremely high energy phenomena which can not be realized by any high energy experiment on earth can be observed . in this case information regarding the physics of so - called ` quantum gravity ' may be obtained .",
    "also , these waves may be so intense that they destroy the cauchy horizon . in this paper the generation of gravitational waves during the collapse of spherical dust ball with small rotational motion is considered .",
    "nakamura , shibata and nakao@xcite have suggested that a naked singularity may emit considerable gravitational wave radiation .",
    "this was proposed from the estimate of gravitational radiation from a spindle - like naked singularity .",
    "they modeled the spindle - like naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse by the newtonian prolate dust collapse for a sequence of general relativistic , momentarily static initial data .",
    "it should be noted that the system they considered is different from that considered in this article and that their result is controversial .",
    "there are numerical analyses that both support and do not support the results of nakamura , shibata and nakao for prolate collapse@xcite and for cylindrical collapse.@xcite    due to the non - linear nature of the problem , it is difficult to analytically solve the einstein equation .",
    "therefore , numerical methods will provide the final tool .",
    "however , its singular behavior makes accurate numerical analysis very difficult at some stage . in this article",
    ", we investigate odd - parity linear gravitational waves from the collapse of an inhomogeneous spherically symmetric dust cloud .",
    "even for the linearized einstein equation , we must perform the numerical integration .",
    "however , in contrast to the numerical simulation of the full einstein equation , high precision is guaranteed for the numerical integration of the linearized einstein equation , even in the region with extremely large spacetime curvature .",
    "furthermore , the linear stability of known examples of naked singularity formation is necessary as a first step to understand the general dynamics near the `` naked singularity formation . ''",
    "recently , iguchi , nakao and harada @xcite ( inh ) studied odd - parity metric perturbations around a naked singularity in the ltb spacetime . in inh , it was found that the propagation of odd - parity gravitational waves is not affected by collapse of a dust cloud , even if there appears a central naked singularity .",
    "when we consider the generation of gravitational waves from the dust collapse , we should analyze the perturbations including their matter part . here",
    "we investigate the evolution equation of the odd - parity quadrupole mode for metric and matter perturbations .",
    "this matter perturbation relates to small rotational motion , and it produces gravitational waves during the collapse .",
    "we follow the derivation of the evolution equations of the perturbations and the numerical method to integrate these equations of inh .",
    "we investigate the time evolutions of the gauge invariant metric variables at the symmetric center , where a naked singularity appears , and at a constant circumferential radius @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the gauge invariant variable diverges only at the center and it does not propagate to the outside .    as we know , the ltb spacetime is one candidate as a counterexample of the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) , which was introduced by penrose.@xcite the cch is a very helpful assumption , because various theorems on the properties of black holes were proved under this assumption . here",
    "the precise formulation and validity of cosmic censorship is not our concern .",
    "we only consider the situation in which the extremely high - density and large - curvature region can be seen by some observer from the gravitational collapse .",
    "such a situation can be regarded as a naked singularity in a practical sense since we are not yet able to predict phenomena beyond the planck scale .",
    "however , here it should be noted that even from this practical point of view , the stability of the cauchy horizon with respect to gravitational - wave perturbations still has an important physical meaning . since in the system considered here ,",
    "the mode propagating with the speed of light is the gravitational waves only , the instability of the cauchy horizon implies that the gravitational wave introduces an extremely large spacetime curvature along the null hypersurface near the cauchy horizon from the region near the central singularity .",
    "hence , if the cauchy horizon in this system is unstable , naked singularity formation of this type might be a strong source of gravitational radiation .    here",
    "we comment on the problem motivated in inh , i.e. , `` nakedness of the naked singularity . ''",
    "odd - parity matter perturbations are produced by rotational motion of the dust cloud .",
    "therefore the growth of the matter perturbation would cause the centrifugal force to dominate the radial motion of the cloud .",
    "hence , an angular momentum bounce would occur .",
    "if this occurs at the center , the central singularity will disappear .",
    "this situation seems to be inevitable for the dipole mode of odd - parity matter perturbations . in the case of a spherically symmetric system composed of counter - rotating particles",
    ", the angular - momentum bounce can actually prevent the naked singularity formation.@xcite   however , for a system without spherical symmetry , it is still an open question how the non - linear asphericity works in the final stage of singularity formation with rotational matter perturbations because of the difficulty of both the analytic and numerical treatment .",
    "further , if the initial matter perturbation is sufficiently small , it might still be possible that the radius of the spacetime curvature becomes the planck length . in this case , the behavior of other modes of perturbations is crucial to understand the classical dynamics in the region of the planck scale . as will be shown below ,",
    "since there is no gravitational wave of the dipole mode and the quadrupole mode generated in the dust cloud does not propagate to the outside , the cauchy horizon is marginally stable against odd - parity perturbations originating in the aspherical rotational motion of matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : be ] , the basic equations are developed ; in  [ sec : results ] , the numerical results are presented ; these results are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] ; in  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we adopt the geometrized units , in which @xmath1 . the signature of the metric tensor and sign convention of the riemann tensor follow ref .  @xcite .",
    "we consider the evolution of odd - parity perturbations of the ltb spacetime up to linear order . the background spacetime and perturbation method",
    "are described in inh .",
    "@xcite  in this section we briefly review them .    using the synchronous coordinate system ,",
    "the line element of the background ltb spacetime can be expressed in the form @xmath2 the energy - momentum tensor for the dust fluid is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rest mass density and @xmath5 is the 4-velocity of the dust fluid . in the synchronous coordinate system ,",
    "the unit vector field normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces is a geodesic , and there is a freedom of which timelike geodesic field is adopted as the hypersurface unit normal . using this freedom , we can always set @xmath6 , since the 4-velocity of the spherically symmetric dust fluid is tangent to an irrotational timelike geodesic field .",
    "then the einstein equations and the equation of motion for the dust fluid reduce to the simple equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath10 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) , @xmath9 is related to the misner - sharp mass function,@xcite @xmath11 , of the dust cloud in the manner @xmath12 hence eq .",
    "( [ eq : energyeq ] ) might be regarded as the energy equation per unit mass .",
    "this means that the other arbitrary function , @xmath8 , is recognized as the specific energy of the dust fluid .",
    "the motion of the dust cloud is completely specified by the function @xmath9 ( or equivalently , the initial distribution of the rest mass density , @xmath13 ) and the specific energy , @xmath8 . when we restrict our calculation to the case that the symmetric center , @xmath14 , is initially regular , the central shell focusing singularity is naked if and only if @xmath15 is initially satisfied for the marginally bound collapse , @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite   for a collapse that is not marginally bound , there exists a similar condition as an inequality for a value depending on the functional forms of @xmath9 and @xmath8.@xcite let us now derive the perturbation equations . the perturbed metric tensor is expressed in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a metric tensor of a spherically symmetric background spacetime and @xmath19 is a perturbation .",

    "these components diverge where and only where @xmath48 diverges . from the linearized einstein equations we obtain the linearized evolution equation for the odd - parity perturbation as @xmath49",
    "the regularity conditions at the center are also considered in inh .",

    "we solve this partial differential equation numerically .    before getting into the detailed explanation of the numerical techniques , we comment on the behavior of the matter perturbation variable @xmath50 around a naked singularity on the slice @xmath67 .",
    "the regularity conditions of @xmath50 and @xmath68 determine the behavior of @xmath69 near the center as @xmath70 this property does not change even if a central singularity appears . however , the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath62 near the center changes at that time . assuming a rest mass density profile of the form @xmath71 we obtain the relation @xmath72 from eqs .",
