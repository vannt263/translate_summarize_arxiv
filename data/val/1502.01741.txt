    "the aim of this article is to study the existence and give a consistent approximation procedure of the boundary value problem for the conservative dynamical system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a smooth potential on @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is an open subset of @xmath4 as this is the relevant case for the applications we have in mind ; extensions to a more general setting are possible but not discussed here .    for the boundary conditions , we write @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here , @xmath8 is part of the problem and has to be determined ( however , the total energy @xmath0 , defined as the sum of kinetic and potential energy , is fixed ) .",
    "the focus on the boundary - value problem is motivated by applications , as discussed below .",
    "equation   ( furnished with various initial or boundary conditions ) can be reformulated as the classic hamiltonian problem @xmath9 for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the _ hamiltonian _ @xmath12    mathematically , the existence of solutions to  , often more succinctly written as @xmath13 with @xmath14 , is a classical problem .",
    "periodic solutions have been a particular focus , and existence results obtained until the early 1980s are discussed in the beautiful survey article  @xcite .",
    "already for periodic solutions , a clear distinction has to be made for local results ( that is , short time solutions ) and global solutions describing solutions in the large . apparently the first global global result was obtained by seifert  @xcite for a hamiltonian which is slightly more general than the one in  .",
    "the key idea of his proof is based on differential geometry , using an equivalent reformulation of   in which solutions can be found as a geodesic in a ( degenerate ) riemannian metric , the so - called jacobi metric .",
    "a curve shortening procedure proposed by g.  d.  birkhoff  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section v.7 ) can then be applied to show the existence of a geodesic .",
    "this result has later been extended by weinstein , and a more general result based on a different variational approach was given by rabinowitz  @xcite .    in the sciences , the interest in non - periodic long time solutions",
    "has recently been rejuvenated by various applications .",
    "namely , complex systems in physics , chemistry or biology can often be described by a potential energy landscape with many wells , separated by barriers .",
    "a common problem is then to find a trajectory joining a given initial point ( configuration ) with a given final point .",
    "we study this problem in the situation where the dynamics is determined by  , and the points given in   are potentially far apart .",
    "in particular , the two configurations will generically be located in different wells of the energy landscape .",
    "rare events are an example of these transitions between two wells .",
    "typically , thermally activated reactions have many deep wells separated by large energy barriers .",
    "reactants will then spend most of the time jostling around in one well before a rare spontaneous fluctuation occurs that lifts the atoms of the reactant over the barrier into the next ( product ) valley .",
    "information on rare events is crucial since they represent important changes in the system , such as chemical reactions or conformational modifications of molecules .",
    "a major challenge in molecular dynamics ( md ) is that these hopping events take place so rarely that the computational limits of md simulations can be easily exceeded .",
    "since the problem   is central in md , a number of solution strategies have been proposed ; see  @xcite for a brief review of some methods .",
    "further , for practitioners of md , the question arises whether any numerical approximation shadows a physical one  @xcite ( and if so , whether it shadows a generic physical trajectory ) .",
    "the lack of hyperbolicity rules out standard tools to prove shadowing ( e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 18.1.3 ) ) .",
    "thus , for md , computations are `` based on trust ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3 ) .",
    "birkhoff s algorithm , for the toy example of the euclidean metric in @xmath15 and for @xmath16 .",
    "the initial curve is plotted as a dashed line .",
    "points with odd index are marked by black dots , points with even index by grey dots . in the first step ,",
    "the points with even indices are kept fixed , and joined by a geodesic .",
    "new positions for the points with odd indices on the new curve are determined ( solid curve ) . in a next step , these points are joined by geodesics , which determines new positions for the points with even indices ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the curves ( slowly ) converge to the geodesic line segment connecting @xmath17 and @xmath18.,height=226 ]    one further difficulty for the computation of hamiltonian trajectories , in particular for md , is that these trajectories are often chaotic , and one has to restrict oneself to averaged statistical information .",
    "however , of particular interest in the analysis of rare events are trajectories going directly from one well of a potential to another one ; such transition paths can be used to define so - called reaction coordinates . often the most efficient algorithms using for example path sampling assume a knowledge of these coordinates and thus these non - chaotic trajectories are of significant practical importance .",
    "the method presented in this article is concerned with the calculation of such non - chaotic transition trajectories .",
    "even these relatively `` simple '' trajectories are in practise very hard to compute , since they correspond to rare events and take place on very long time scales .      rather working with the hamiltonian boundary value problem   directly",
    ", we use an equivalent variational formulation , namely the maupertuis principle , according to which trajectories to   with total energy @xmath0 are suitably re - parametrised geodesics with respect to the _ jacobi metric _ @xmath19 ( more generally , if @xmath3 is equipped with a riemannian metric @xmath20 , then @xmath21 ) .",
    "so hamiltonian trajectories are critical points of the length functional associated with  .",
    "while the equivalence has been known for centuries , it seems that little advantage has been taken of the fact that this variational formulation has a very convenient mathematical structure .",
    "note that hamiltonian problems such as   are commonly indefinite , while a geodesic problem is elliptic and thus bounded from below .",
    "so the problem reduces to that of finding geodesics in the jacobi metric .",
    "this problem has been addressed by birkhoff , who described a curve shortening procedure to find global geodesics under the assumption that local ( sufficiently short ) geodesics can be found explicitly .",
    "this assumption is not met here since local geodesics have to be approximated ; the main task is to show that nevertheless global convergence can be obtained for a suitably devised local approximation scheme . since the local scheme we propose also relies on a birkhoff curve shortening idea , we present his idea in the global setting first to keep the presentation self - contained . initially , one joins the given initial and final point @xmath22 and @xmath23 by an arbitrary curve .",
    "then sufficiently many points are marked on the curve so that a local geodesic can be computed between next to nearest neighbours ( see figure  [ fig : birkhoffeuclid ] ) .",
    "note that the argument assumes that local geodesics can be computed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "in the first step , the points with even indices are kept fixed , and joined by a geodesic .",
    "new positions for the points with odd indices on the new curve are determined ( solid curve in figure  [ fig : birkhoffeuclid ] ) .",
    "the procedure of joining next to nearest neighbouring points by local geodesics is then repeated for the points with odd indices ( dotted curve in figure  [ fig : birkhoffeuclid ] ) .",
    "it is not hard to show that this iterative procedure decreases the length . under suitable assumptions ( e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    ", this method can be shown to converge to a global geodesic ; however , there are situations such as for degenerating metrics where convergence will not take place .",
    "the central result of this article is an analogous local result , introducing a sequence of approximating sequences converging to a sufficiently short geodesic .",
    "the trade - off is that the result is local ( applicable only to sufficient short geodesics ) , but does not assume that the approximating sequences consist of exact geodesic segments .",
    "we rely on the observation that the global birkhoff argument localises the geodesic problem in a geometrically tractable way .",
    "that is , one can restrict the local analysis to points which are sufficiently close .",
    "we then show that they can be joined by a geodesic which in addition can be represented as a graph and prove consistency and convergence of the proposed local approximation .      the main result of this article is a consistent approximation of what we call local geodesics ; important aspects are that the proof is constructive and yields bounds on the allowed distance between points to be joined by local geodesics .",
    "the bounds are not in terms of the usual estimates from differential geometry ( such as the injectivity radius , that is , the radius for which there is a unique geodesic starting at the centre , with arbitrary velocity ) , but are expressed explicitly in terms of the total and potential energy of the molecular hamiltonian system  .",
    "we point out that locality of the geodesics does not necessarily require that the two end points are very close ; an important aspect of the proof is that we may consider local geodesics which can be represented as graphs .",
    "global geodesics can violate this assumption , while suitably small segments of geodesics remain geodesics and can be represented as graphs .",
    "birkhoff s idea to segment an original connecting curve allows us to confine our algorithm to such local geodesics .",
    "the efficiency and applicability of a global birkhoff method as in  @xcite will depend on the chosen parametrisation ( number and location of points in figure  [ fig : birkhoffeuclid ] ) .",
    "for example , it is possible that refinements in a numerical implementation are required .",
    "however , the proof shows that in the setting studied in this article , no refinement or reparametrisation is required .    as a by - product",
    ", we show the existence of a continuous ( physical ) trajectory for suitable points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , using the jacobi formulation as seifert  @xcite , but replacing the periodic boundary conditions considered there by equation  .",
    "there are some related existence results  @xcite , which also rely on the jacobi formulation .",
    "the novelty of the results presented here are twofold : ( i ) while a formulation using the jacobi metric is natural , a difficulty is that the metric degenerates at the boundary @xmath24 of the configuration space , where kinetic energy @xmath25 and potential energy @xmath26 agree .",
    "we provide _ a priori _ bounds to ensure that the geodesic stays away from @xmath24 ; the bounds depend on the location of the boundary points @xmath22 and @xmath23 or on the total energy @xmath0 .",
    "bounds could be obtained along the lines of thought presented in this paper , but in a simpler fashion .",
    "the reason why we give a more complicated argument is that the approximation we give here is constructive , giving existence of a solution and at the same time a consistent approximation procedure .",
    "thus , we obtain an approximation procedure which may not necessarily be the most efficient but one for which can dispense with the need for trust .",
    "since the algorithm we develop is consistent , the issue of shadowing is answered in an affirmative way for the procedure we propose , under the assumptions made on the potential energy @xmath2 and the bounds in term of total energy @xmath0 made on the end points .",
    "the existence of geodesics joining a given initial and final point in open domains @xmath3 , which is trivial within the radius of injectivity , is not obvious if the two points are further away from each other .",
    "we point out that the argument of this paper automatically proves the existence of such a geodesics for the jacobi metric with sufficiently large total energy @xmath0 .",
    "other existence results , proceeding along quite different lines , can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we remark that we will not address the question of how to choose @xmath0 ; this choice typically requires insight in the physics , chemistry or biology of the problem in question and thus can not be answered in the general mathematical framework considered here .",
    "however , the existence result given here can be interpreted in two ways : given the initial point @xmath22 and the total energy @xmath0 , the arguments provide estimates on possible locations of the final point @xmath23 so that @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be joined by a trajectory with total energy @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , given @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the analysis provides lower bounds on @xmath0 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be joined with this total energy .",
    "it is easy to see that no general existence theorem can hold if @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 are unrestricted ( @xmath0 determines the configuration manifold @xmath3 , and in particular for small @xmath0 the configuration manifold may be disconnected , so @xmath22 and @xmath23 could be in different components ) .",
    "approximations which are proven to be consistent , such as godunov s scheme for hyperbolic equations , are often less efficient than algorithms for which consistency can not be shown .",
    "the approximation introduced in this article is no exception .",
    "yet , it is often possible to take inspiration from a consistent approximation and deduce efficient ( but not provably consistent ) formulations .",
    "this is the case for the formulation introduced here ; a related flow model approximation has been shown to be able to detect different trajectories joining points in different wells of the energy landscape of the mller potential and the collinear reaction @xmath27  @xcite . while our formulation relies both on the choice of maupertuis formulation and birkhoff s curve shortening , which seems to be new to the field of numerical methods for molecular dynamics , the curve - shortening procedures resembles other rubber - band algorithms  @xcite .",
    "for the isothermal case , a nudged elastic band method has been proposed by e , ren and vanden - eijnden  @xcite . there , the aim is to find minimal energy paths , which are defined as paths along which the orthogonal component of the deterministic vector field vanishes .",
    "the approach in  @xcite to reduce the orthogonal contributions iteratively bears many similarities with the method presented here . as examples of string methods with temperature",
    ", we refer to the pioneering work by e , ren and vanden - eijnden  @xcite .",
    "maupertuis principle has been used before in md  @xcite , but without the connection to birkhoff s curve shortening method .",
    "we also refer the reader to the recent work by cameron , kohn and vanden - eijnden which gives an analysis and in particular convergence results for a steepest descent string method  @xcite .",
    "the usual numerical approach for a boundary value problem is a shooting method ; there , the existence of a solution is assumed as well as the closeness of an initial guess to the solution .",
    "( there are abstract existence results available , see for example  @xcite ; however , as noted by stoer and bulirsch  @xcite , the abstract formulation of the boundary conditions to be imposed rules out the condition  , for the first - order system considered there , even for the case @xmath28 . )",
    "the method discussed in this paper provides both an explicit existence proof and estimates on the closeness required .",
    "we point out that the birkhoff algorithm also provides a strategy for gluing together local geodesics to obtain global paths , which converge to a global geodesic .",
    "note that this latter aspect of the birkhoff approach defines a natural tool to localise the computation of geodesics which can be exploited for parallelisation .",
    "this aspect is discussed in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of birkhoff s method is that these local steps are intrinsically parallelisable .",
    "finally , we mention connections to the onsager - machlup / freidlin - wentzell theory . there , an action functional is derived , with the minimal action path describing the most likely trajectory .",
    "the connection between that theory , hamilton - jacobi theory and the maupertuis principle as discussed here is a topic with many open questions ; we refer to  @xcite for results in this direction together with applications to rare events .      throughout the presentation",
    ", @xmath3 is the _ configuration manifold _ of a system and thus describes all possible states the system can occupy .",

    "analogously , the coordinates of the tangent bundle @xmath31 are @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the velocity .",

    "is often called the _ energy _ of @xmath50 ; the _ length _ of the curve is then @xmath52 { : = } \\int_a^b \\sqrt{r{\\left(}\\gamma,\\gamma'{\\right ) } } { \\ , \\mathrm{d}}\\tau .\\ ] ] it is trivial to verify that critical points of the energy functional are critical points of the length functional ; the converse is true for curves parameterised by arc length .",
    "the length functional is invariant under re - parametrisations , while a minimiser of the energy functional is automatically parameterised by arc length .",
    "the maupertuis principle seeks geodesics , that is , stationary solutions of the functional   with the metric  .",
    "maupertuis principle has been employed in a number of computational approaches and is regarded as a very accurate method for the verification of other algorithmic formulations  @xcite .",
    "we already mentioned in passing that solutions of   are re - parametrisations of solutions of   ( or , equivalently ,  ) .",
    "the re - parametrisation is such that the physical time for a solution of   can be recovered via the explicit formula @xmath53    with the exception of  @xcite , numerical methods for   seem , to the best of our knowledge , not have taken advantage of the geodesic formulation   ( see  @xcite for a recent survey and a method that relies on observations similar to , but simpler than , those made in the present article ) .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since the _ birkhoff curve shortening algorithm _ is a classic method for the convergent approximation of geodesics .",
    "birkhoff s curve shortening method  @xcite is a constructive way to find extended geodesics , based on the assumption that local ( short ) geodesics ( that is , geodesics joining points within the radius of injectivity ) can be computed exactly . in this subsection , we recall the classic birkhoff method ; the main part of the paper then addresses the question of how to find the local geodesics constructively , for the case of the jacobi metric .",
    "a straightforward implementation of the birkhoff method relies on an approximation of local geodesics within the radius of injectivity and thus requires knowledge of the radius of injectivity . for the complex energy landscapes we have in mind , this radius is not easily computable in a quantitative way .",
    "thus , we have here two aims .",
    "firstly , we present an algorithm for the numerical approximation of local geodesics in an explicitly given neighbourhood . secondly , we obtain a quantitative description of the size of this neighbourhood . a birkhoff method then glues together these local geodesics to obtain an extended piecewise geodesic curve .",
    "the aim of this article is to develop a discrete framework that mimics the birkhoff procedure . besides the usual difficulty of discretisation errors inherent in any numerical approach , we face the challenge that even the computation of local geodesics , as in birkhoff s algorithm , is time - consuming and difficult to control for non - euclidean metrics .",
    "we propose an approximation of jacobi s metric   by the trapezoidal rule .",
    "the key observation is that the difference between the jacobi metric and the euclidean metric occurs on a fine scale , described in greater detail below .",
    "the analysis of section  [ sec : discr - sett - birkh ] will show that crucial bounds on the discrete curvature in a birkhoff procedure can be obtained since it is possible to show that in some ( quantitatively characterised ) situations the birkhoff procedure for the jacobi metric is locally identical to that for the euclidean metric .",
    "the analysis will also reveal that for other configurations , that is , other geometric configurations , the two approximations differ , which results in the jacobi procedure making steps which seem counter - intuitive if regarded within a euclidean picture .",
    "obviously , such a disagreement of the two approximations is necessary as we need to compute a geodesic in the jacobi metric and thus have to differ at some point from the euclidean picture .",
    "this section mimics the continuous framework laid out in section  [ sec : continuous - setting ] in a discrete setting .      throughout this section , we assume that the total energy @xmath0 is sufficiently large , as described in the next paragraph .",
    "we point out that the choice of @xmath0 determines the configuration manifold @xmath54 , which we take as the set of points @xmath39 where @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath56 be given ; define @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the euclidean distance on @xmath3 ( not the jacobi distance ) .",
    "we choose an orthonormal basis for @xmath3 such that @xmath59 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "we write @xmath61 , and in particular @xmath62 .",
    "let us write the jacobi metric in the form @xmath63    we require @xmath0 to be sufficiently large so that the line segment joining @xmath22 and @xmath23 is contained in @xmath3 as well .",
    "in fact , we will work in a framework where either @xmath0 is chosen large enough , depending on the given points @xmath22 and @xmath23 , or , given @xmath0 , we choose points @xmath22 and @xmath23 in @xmath3 with sufficiently small distance @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 .",

    "show the computational error of the polygonal approximation compared to the explicit geodesic ( measured in the @xmath419 norm ) in the left panel and the computational effort , measured in the number of affirmative birkhoff steps , in the right panel .",
    "the error decreases as @xmath420 decreases for @xmath416 .",
    "in fact , the calculation shows the error is proportional to @xmath417 , where the exponent @xmath421 varies from 0.40 to 0.53 , depending on the choice of @xmath422 in the metric .",
    "the effort increases as @xmath121 decreases , and the simulation shows that the effort turns out to be ( inversely ) proportional to @xmath423 , where @xmath421 ranges from 1.71 to 2.2 , as @xmath414 is taken from @xmath410 , @xmath411 , @xmath412 .    hence , for geodesics of larger curvature variation , the birkhoff procedure starts closer but converges with smaller rate in @xmath121 , whereas the effort increases with largely uniform rate in @xmath121 of about @xmath424 .",

    "<S> this article studies the existence of long - time solutions to the hamiltonian boundary value problem , and their consistent numerical approximation . such a boundary value problem is , for example , common in molecular dynamics , where one aims at finding a dynamic trajectory that joins a given initial state with a final one , with the evolution being governed by classical ( hamiltonian ) dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the setting considered here is sufficiently general so that long time transition trajectories connecting two configurations can be included , provided the total energy @xmath0 is chosen suitably . in particular , the formulation presented here can be used to detect transition paths between two stable basins and thus to prove the existence of long - time trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is the formulation of the equation of motion of classical mechanics in the framework of jacobi s principle ; a curve shortening procedure inspired by birkhoff s method is then developed to find geodesic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can be viewed as a string method .        dedicated to professor armin leutbecher on the occasion of his 80th birthday </S>"
