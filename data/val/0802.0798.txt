    "while progress in theoretical modeling and computer simulations of ion channeling through carbon nanotubes has reached a mature level , as recently reviewed in ref . , efforts of experimentalists have only recently begun to bear fruit in this important research area . because the best level of ordering and straightening of carbon nanotubes is achieved when they are grown in a dielectric matrix , such structures are perhaps the most suitable candidates for ion channeling through carbon nanotubes .",
    "it thus came as no surprise when zhu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recently reported the first experimental data on he@xmath1 channeling through an array of well ordered , multi - wall carbon nanotubes ( mwnts ) which were grown in a porous anodic aluminum oxide ( al@xmath2o@xmath3 ) membrane . on the other hand ,",
    "carbon nanotubes have also been grown selectively within etched ion tracks in sio@xmath2 layers on si by another experimental group @xcite , thus offering an interesting possibility for realization of ion channeling through individual , single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) at a wide range of ion energies .",
    "in addition , in many applications of carbon nanotubes it is desirable to have them embedded in a dielectric such as sio@xmath2 @xcite , or clamped by a metal shield @xcite made of nickel , which is known to most readily bind to carbon nanotubes @xcite .    for ion channeling at the low ( kev ) and high ( gev ) ends of the energy range , the surrounding material would predominantly serve as a passive container of carbon nanotubes when the dynamics of ion motion is concerned .",
    "however , ions moving with medium ( mev ) energies will induce strong dynamic polarization of valence electrons in the nanotubes which in turn will give rise to a sizeable image force on the ions , as well as a considerable energy loss due to the collective , or plasma , electron excitations . the dynamic image force has been recently shown to give rise to the rainbow effect in the angular distributions of protons channeled through short ( 11 ,  9 ) single - wall @xcite and double - wall carbon nanotubes @xcite in free space , which is not otherwise observable in simulations of ion channeling through chiral carbon nanotubes using the continuum approximation for the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "obviously , the presence of dielectric media may affect these dynamic polarization forces , as well as the resulting ion trajectories , making the analysis of such effects in ion channeling through carbon nanotubes a timely task , which we take up in this contribution .",
    "in particular , we are interested here primarily in the effects of dielectric media on the dynamic image force on channeled ions and their angular distributions .",
    "the rainbow effect occurs and plays an important role in photon scattering from water droplets @xcite , nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite , atom or ion collisions with atoms or molecules @xcite , electron - molecule collisions @xcite , atom or electron scattering from crystal surfaces @xcite , and ion channeling in crystals @xcite .",
    "moreover , the rainbow effect has been investigated recently in the context of grazing scattering of atoms from metal surfaces under channeling conditions by schller _",
    "@xcite who showed that precise measurements of the well - defined maxima in the angular distributions of scattered atoms , attributed to the rainbow effect , can give detailed information on the interaction potential of the atoms with the metal surfaces . on the other hand ,",
    "the theory of crystal rainbows has been formulated as the proper theory of ion channeling in thin crystals @xcite , and has been subsequently applied to ion channeling in short carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that , in analogy with the surface channeling experiments @xcite , measurements of the rainbow effect in carbon nanotubes may give precise information on both the atomic configuration and the interaction potentials within such structures , which are not completely known at present .",
    "previously reported simulations of ion channeling in carbon nanotubes @xcite paid virtually no attention to the effects of dynamic polarization of the nanotube valence electrons .",
    "however , this process is expected to contribute to the ion energy loss and to give rise to strong image forces on the medium - energy ions @xcite , as was recently demonstrated in the computer simulations of angular distributions of protons channeled through chiral single - walled carbon nanotubes in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the importance of the image force has also been emphasized in the related area of ion transmission through cylindrical channels in metals @xcite . whereas interesting parallels can be drawn between ion channeling through carbon nanotubes and ion transmission through capillaries , it is important to notice several crucial differences .",
    "namely , while the lengths of capillaries in metals can be comparable to those of nanotubes considered here for ion channeling , their diameters are typically an order of magnitude , or more , larger than those of carbon nanotubes , making their aspect ratios considerably smaller .",
    "more importantly , the inner surfaces of such broad channels in metals usually appear to be quite rough , which does not seem to affect too much the transmission of slow , highly - charged ions through such structures @xcite .",
    "however , it is questionable whether conditions required for channeling of fast ions leading to the rainbow effect can be met in capillaries with such characteristics @xcite . on the other hand , in cases where carbon nanotubes are grown in amorphous channels in a dielectric such as al@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite and sio@xmath2 @xcite , or",
    "are coated by an amorphous layer of metal @xcite , it is precisely the regular atomic structure of carbon nanotube that acts as a smooth `` sleeve '' , or `` mantle '' covering the underlying rough surface of the surrounding material , thus enabling ion channeling through such structures .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , whether large , multi - walled carbon nanotubes can be grown inside the broad capillaries in metals enabling some sort of ion channeling in their interior hollow regions .",
    "we shall investigate here how dynamic polarization of carbon valence electrons influences the angular distributions of protons channeled in ( 11 ,  9 ) swnts with different dielectric media surrounding the nanotubes .",
    "we consider proton speeds between 3 and 10 a.u . , and nanotube lengths between 0.1 and 1 @xmath0 m .",
    "the image force acting on an ion moving in a nanotube surrounded by a dielectric medium has been recently calculated by means of a two dimensional ( 2d ) hydrodynamic model for the carbon valence electrons , while the surrounding medium was described by a suitable frequency dependent dielectric function @xcite . in the present simulations",
    ", we shall use the van der waals radius of a carbon atom ( 0.17 nm ) to approximate the distance between the nanotube wall and various dielectric media @xcite .",
    "this value also agrees with our density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the average equilibrium separation between graphene and a ni ( 111 ) surface , based on the methodology described in ref . .",
    "other details of our simulation are similar to those reported earlier @xcite .    after outlining the basic theory used in modeling the dynamic polarization effects of carbon nanotubes",
    ", we shall discuss the results of our ion trajectory simulations and give our concluding remarks .",
    "atomic units will be used throughout unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the system under investigation is a proton moving through an ( 11 ,  9 ) swnt surrounded by a dielectric medium . the z - axis coincides with the nanotube axis and",
    "the origin lies in its entrance plane .",
    "the initial proton velocity vector , @xmath4 , is taken to be parallel to the z - axis .",
    "proton speeds between 3 and 10 a.u . , corresponding to energies of 0.223 and 2.49 mev , are considered , with the nanotube s length varied between 0.1 and 1 @xmath0 m .",
    "we also assume that the repulsive interaction between the proton and the nanotube atoms may be treated classically , using the doyle - turner expression for the proton - carbon atom interaction potential @xcite , averaged axially @xcite and azimuthally @xcite .",

    ".    the dynamic polarization of the nanotube is treated by a 2d hydrodynamic model of the nanotube valence electrons , based on a jellium - like description of the ion cores on the nanotube wall @xcite .",

    "therefore , when calculating the dynamic image force on a proton one may safely consider its longitudinal velocity component as constant equal to its initial speed @xmath42 , while changes in the perpendicular components of the proton velocity @xmath67 can be neglected under channeling conditions .",
    "consequently , one may consider the radial position @xmath68 of a channeled proton to evolve adiabatically under the action of an axially symmetric force field , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . because our numerical calculations of proton trajectories will be executed under the assumption of a homogeneous , mono - directional beam of protons incident in the direction parallel to the nanotube axis",
    ", the resulting simulation code will be essentially two - dimensional ( 2d ) .",
    "the effects on proton channeling coming from a divergent beam and non - parallel incidence will be studied by a full 3d code in future reports .",
    "it should be also mentioned that the assumption that proton charge remains fixed at @xmath6 = 1 , which is used in our channeling simulations , needs careful consideration .",
    "making analogy with the analysis of experiments on grazing scattering of protons on an al surface @xcite and referring to the data on proton transmission through carbon foils @xcite , one may expect that the @xmath6 = 1 charge state would be the most dominant fraction for protons channeled in carbon nanotubes at the speeds in excess of @xmath42 = 3 .",
    "nevertheless , simultaneous measurements of the angular distributions of transmitted particles in different charge states could reveal a wealth of information on both the image interactions and the charge transfer processes taking place in short nanotubes , in close analogy with the experiments done by winter @xcite . on the other hand , for ion channeling through longer nanoubes",
    ", the image force itself can be quite strongly affected by the dynamics of the charge - changing events near the nanotube wall , as was shown recently for grazing scattering of protons from an al surface @xcite .",
    "the effects of charge transfer will be included in our future ion channeling simulations .",
    "the angular distributions of transmitted protons are generated using a monte - carlo computer simulation method .",
    "the cartesian components of the proton impact parameter , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are chosen from a random uniform distribution within the nanotube cross - sectional area . with the bond length between the nanotube atoms being 0.144 nm @xcite",
    ", we obtain for the radius of the ( 11 ,  9 ) nanotube of @xmath9 = 0.689 nm .",
    "any protons with an impact point inside the annulus with radii in the interval @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75^\\frac{1}{3}a_\\mathrm{0}$ ] is the screening length ( with @xmath76 being bohr s radius ) , are treated as if they were backscattered and are disregarded from the simulation .",
    "the initial number of protons used is 3  141  929 .",
    "the cartesian components of the proton scattering angle , i.e. , of the deflection function , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are obtained via the expressions @xmath77 = @xmath79 and @xmath78 = @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the cartesian components of the final perpendicular velocity vector , @xmath83 , obtained in our simulation of transmitted protons .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the proton channeling in nanotubes can be analyzed successfully via the corresponding mapping of the impact parameter plane , the @xmath84 plane , to the scattering angle plane , the @xmath85 plane .",
    "however , as the total interaction potential in the case under consideration is axially symmetric and the incident protons are moving parallel to the nanotube axis , the analysis of the mapping may be reduced to the analysis of the scattering angle , @xmath86 , as a function of the impact parameter , @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , we may take @xmath73 = 0 , and analyze the deflection function @xmath88 only .",
    "the extrema of this function are the rainbow extrema , and the corresponding singularities appearing in the angular distribution of channeled protons are the rainbow singularities @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall first discuss in figures [ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] respectively the image force and the total interaction force for a proton channeled in an ( 11 ,  9 ) swnt in vacuum and encapsulated by sio@xmath2 , al@xmath2o@xmath3 and ni channels .",

    "all our findings indicate that it is important to carefully consider in future simulations and experiments the role played by dielectric media in ion channeling through carbon nanotubes at the mev energies .",
    "for example , the best well ordered carbon nanotubes have been grown in porous dielectric media , such as al@xmath2o@xmath3 , so that in any analysis of ion channeling experiments through such structures one may not realistically ignore the influence of dielectric media . moreover , in the experiment by zhu _",
    "@xcite , angular distributions of ions channeled through the nanotubes grown inside the pores in al@xmath2o@xmath3 were compared with those coming from ion channeling through the pores of pristine al@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to perform comparative simulations of ion channeling through channels in different materials , with and without carbon nanotubes embedded in them , while taking proper account of the dynamic polarization effects .",
    "while a detailed study of this problem is in progress , some qualitative predictions can be made here for channels inside conducting materials .",
    "based on recent calculations of the dynamic polarization of such structures @xcite , it follows that the image force would be expected to play similar role as described in the present work , at least judging by its magnitudes for a nanotube in vacuum and for an empty channel in metal having the same radius as nanotube ( compare thin solid lines with dashed lines in fig.[fig01](c ) ) .",
    "however , it is questionable whether the atomic structure of walls in such channels would be smooth enough to support the rainbow effect @xcite .",
    "this leaves the zdf as probably the most robust feature associated with the image force , which could be probed with comparable degrees of experimental detail for ion channeling through both pristine channels and carbon nanotubes grown in those channels .",
    "we finally note that such studies may further elucidate dielectric properties of carbon nanotubes in the presence of dielectric media of relevance to nanoelectronic , such as sio@xmath2 .",
