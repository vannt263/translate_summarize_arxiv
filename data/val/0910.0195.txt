    "one of the main challenges of the many - body theory and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is to understand the properties of relaxation of large interacting quantum systems .",
    "there are two common approaches to this type of problems .",
    "one important direction is to try to define dynamics in the thermodynamic limit and to investigate its properties with rigorous mathematical methods of operator algebras @xcite .",
    "however , in this context explicit results which go beyond existence proofs are quite limited .",
    "a second approach is to split a large system into a tensor product of a smaller system of interest , and the rest ( environment ) , and trying to eliminate all the degrees of freedom of the large , macroscopic environment ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this approach , although involving a series of approximations , is usually more fruitful for explicit calculations and quantitative analyses .",
    "we may be interested either in relaxation to equilibrium or non - equilibrium steady states , depending on the equal or non - equal values of thermodynamic potentials assigned to possibly several pieces of environment - which we shall call _ the baths_. such calculations of the quantitative properties of steady states may be very useful , for example in the realm of transport theory @xcite as may complement the linear response calculations and suggest non - linear response or far - from - equilibrium effects .",
    "however , to date we have had a very few explicit calculations of non - equilibrium properties of open many body quantum systems , and mainly they had to focus on small systems with a single or a pair of degrees of freedoms ( such as spins , or bosons ) , see for example @xcite .",
    "the reason is that there has been no theoretical techniques to deal with open many - body problems except for the keldysh formalism of non - equilibrium green s functions , which however can easily get too involved for explicit calculations .",
    "recently , two new directions have been proposed , both in the direction of numerical simulation and theoretical analysis .",
    "namely , in the context of numerical simulations of open many - body systems , time - dependent density matrix renormalization group techniques @xcite have been demonstrated to efficiently simulate relaxation to steady states with the lindblad master equation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the lindblad equation for general quadratic fermionic systems , for example for xy - like quantum spin chains which are mappable to quadratic fermionic systems , can be solved explicitly with the technique of canonical quantization in the fock space of operators - _ third quantization _ for short .    in this paper",
    "we shall show how the third quantization can be generalized to treat quadratic systems with arbitrary markovian master equations , which is not necessarily of the lindblad form .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on the redfield dissipator in terms of which we can simulate simple thermal reservoirs , and thermal driving of the system under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "after giving a short account on mathematical formulation of markovian master equations and the basic physical assumptions and approximations involved in the derivation - in section [ sect : markovian ] , we shall in section [ sect : method ] present a short but self - contained generalization of the theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , we shall outline the calculation of dynamical correlation functions in liouvillean dynamics , and formulate an exact treatment of explicitly time - dependent quantum liouville problems . in section [",
    "sect : xy ] we shall apply our technique to treat an open xy spin chain in the non - equilibrium redfield model . we shall outline several intriguing exact numerical results on large spin chains . in particular , we show that recently announced quantum phase transition in the open xy chain in the local lindblad bath model , generalizes also to non - equilibrium thermal redfield model with qualitatively identical characteristics .",
    "the transition is characterized by spontaneous emergence of long range magnetic correlations , and hypersensitivity of the steady state to external system s parameters , when the transverse magnetic field drops bellow the critical value @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "furthermore , we analyze in some detail the heat transport in xy chain , and find regions of _ negative differential heat conductance _ for strong thermal driving , namely non - monotonic dependence of the heat current on the temperature difference between the baths .",
    "decomposing the hilbert space of the universe into a tensor product @xmath4 of the _ central system _ @xmath5 and the _ bath _ ( or a set of baths ) @xmath6 ( environment ) , one writes the total hamiltonian as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , are linear operators over @xmath5 , and @xmath9 linear operators over @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath10 can always be chosen to be hermitian , so this shall be assumed throughout this paper .",
    "the markovian quantum master equation for the time evolution of the central systems s density matrix @xmath11 is derived @xcite using three main assumptions : ( i ) weak coupling ( assuming @xmath12 to be small ) , ( ii ) factorizability of the initial density matrix @xmath13 , and ( iii ) born - markov approximation which rests upon the assumption that the bath - correlation functions @xmath14 decay on much shorter time scale than the central systems dynamics @xmath15 .",
    "we use units in which planck s constant @xmath16 , and may use different inverse temperatures @xmath17 for different pieces of the environment ( for different baths ) .",
    "the resulting master equation is referred to as the redfield equation @xmath18 + \\hat{\\cal d}\\rho(t ) , \\label{eq : master}\\ ] ] where the dissipator - map has a memoryless kernel with the following general form @xmath19 + h.c .",
    "\\label{eq : redfd}\\ ] ] if one additionally assumes the so - called rotating wave - approximation , one arrives at the dynamical semi - group which manifestly preserves the positivity of density matrix at all times,[eq : redfd ] ) which allows for possible breaking of positivity at initial short time interval , the so called _ sleapage time_. ] and can be generally described by the dissipator in the lindblad form @xmath20 + h.c .",
    ", \\label{eq : lindd}\\ ] ] where the only condition is that @xmath21 is a hermitian @xmath22 and positive definite matrix .",
    "the standard lindblad form is obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath21 whose eigenvectors yield the usual lindblad operators . the important property of the bath - correlation functions ( [ eq : spectf ] ) ( which constitute all that we need to know about the baths ) is the kubo - martin - schwinger(_kms _ ) condition @xmath23 which is needed to prove that the thermal state @xmath24 is a steady state of the master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) , provided that all baths are thermalized to the _ same _ inverse temperature , see the discussion at the end of subsection [ bilinear ] ] . however , in case of several thermal baths with possibly different temperatures we may expect that @xmath11 relaxes to a physically very interesting _ non - equilibrium - steady - state _ ( ness ) .",
    "in this section we give a short account on the general technique of canonical quantization in the liouvile space ( ` third quantization ' ) and complete diagonalization of markovian master equations ( [ eq : master ] ) , with ( [ eq : redfd ] ) or ( [ eq : lindd ] ) , for quadratic fermionic problems .",

    "in fact it is easy to show that @xmath47 is a fermionic fock basis , and powers @xmath50 in the product ( [ eq : defp ] ) can be considered like a sort of fermionic excitations , if we define the following set of linear _ annihilation maps _ @xmath51 over . ]",

    "we define @xmath87 hermitian majorana maps @xmath88 @xmath89 and express the liouvillean as @xmath90 where the @xmath1 complex antisymmetrix matrix @xmath91 , later referred to as a _ structure matrix _ , and a scalar @xmath92 , can be expressed as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a @xmath31 bath - matrix which can be compactly written as @xmath95 defining the bath - spectral functions @xmath96 for which the kms condition reads @xmath97 and extending the range of integration in ( [ eq : zdef ] ) to @xmath98 $ ] , or better to say , neglecting the cauchy principal value parts in the integrals - which exactly amounts to neglecting the _ lamb - shift hamiltonian term _",
    "@xcite in the master equation - we obtain a very simple expression ( involving only finite sums ) for the bath - vectors @xmath99    at this point a remark on neglecting the lamb - shift term is in order .",
    "as the redfield model already involves a series of physical assumptions and approximations it is somewhat difficult to argue under what conditions these terms can be dropped on the same level of approximations .",
    "however , one can straightforwardly show using the kms condition ( [ eq : kms ] ) and hermiticity @xmath100 that _ only if _ the cauchy principal value terms are dropped ( i.e. if the range of integration in ( [ eq : redfd ] ) is extended to @xmath98 $ ] ) the redfield dissipator annihilates the gibbs state @xmath101 , and hence gibbs state is the steady state of equilibrium thermal redfield model .",
    "note again that the inverse temperature in ( [ eq : znu ] ) could in principle be a function of the bath - index @xmath102 in case one would be interested in non - equilibrium situation with couplings to several different temperatures .",
    "but we should stress that _ different _ temperatures only make sense among _ uncorrelated baths _ for which @xmath103 for any @xmath17 .",
    "we note also that the present formalism uniformly covers both the redfield and the lindblad master equations , as the lindblad dissipator ( [ eq : lindd ] ) is obtained from ( [ eq : redfd ] ) by simply taking the limit @xmath104 , and then the bath - matrix reduces to a hermitian form @xmath105 which is equivalent to the one used in @xcite .      having the compact form of the liouvillean ( [ eq : liouva ] )  and assuming for the time being that the structure matrix @xmath91 is _ static _ i.e. there is _ no explicit time dependence _ in the matrix @xmath32 or coupling vectors @xmath106  we follow ref.@xcite and explicitly construct its normal form , the ness which is exactly the right - vacuum state of ( [ eq : liouva ] ) @xmath107 , the spectral gap , and the full spectrum of liouvillean decay modes , all in terms of spectral decomposition of @xmath1 matrix @xmath91 .",

    "therefore , in ness the expectation value of the current @xmath273 should be independent of the position @xmath206 . by looking at the dependence of the steady - state current on the system size",

    "[ fig : tok ] we plot @xmath273 versus @xmath181 and @xmath183 and find a maximum of the current for intermediate driving , namely when one of the temperatures is less than one @xmath275 and the other temperature is about @xmath276 .",
    "this is a clear signature of _ negative differential heat conductance _ which could perhaps be related to similar far - from - equilibroum effects recently observed in spin and charge transport @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be nicely characterized by computing the gibbs entropy of ness . since ness is completely characterized by quadratic correlations @xmath277 and the wick theorem",
    ", one can adopt the recipe which has been proposed in ref.@xcite for computing block entropies ( or entanglement entropies ) applied to the entire lattice .",
    "in fact , taking an arbitrary block region @xmath278 , one can compute von neumann entropy @xmath279 ( in base @xmath280 ) , where @xmath281 is a reduced density matrix and @xmath282 denotes the complement of @xmath283 , as @xmath284 and @xmath285 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath286 part of the correlation matrix @xmath287 defined by @xmath288 , restricted to majorana operators @xmath289 corresponding to spins from the block @xmath283 .",
    "the same general procedure has been applied to thermal ( gibbs ) states in ref.@xcite . when taking the maximal block @xmath290 we obtain exactly the standard gibbs entropy of ness .",
    "in figure [ fig : entropy ] we plot the gibbs entropy @xmath291 as a function of two bath temperatures and show that , quite remarkably , the regions of large ( maximal ) heat current correspond to regions of large ( locally maximal ) gibbs entropy .",
    "this is not unexpected as the product of the heat current and the inverse temperature difference @xmath236 may be understood as the _ entropy production rate_.    calculation of gibbs entropy of ness provides also a nice way of controlling the positivity of ness as a density matrix , since this is by no means guaranteed by the redfield master equation .",
    "indeed we find that for very small temperatures ( large @xmath17 s ) , or for very strong bath coupling @xmath12 , the positivity of ness might be slightly violated ( red region in figure [ fig : entropy ] ) , namely some of the correlation matrix eigenvalues @xmath292 become slightly larger than @xmath50 ( but in our numerical experience never by more than @xmath293 or so ) .",
    "versus two inverse temperatures @xmath181 and @xmath183 for the non - equilibrium thermal redfield model of an open xy chain with @xmath227 , sistem size @xmath294 , and bath parameters given in the text .",
    "note that the ` shoulders ' of maxima , around @xmath295 , and with @xmath296 and @xmath297 exchanged , could be interpreted as _ negative differential heat conductance_. ]    we can use the concept of block entropy of ness to further characterize the non - equilibrium phase transition . for example , we may compute the total ( quantum plus classical ) correlations between two halves of the spin chain in ness as given by _ quantum mutual information _",
    "qmi @xmath298 .     and @xmath183 for the same parameters as in the figure [ fig : tok ] .",
    "note that in the red region ( of both large inverse temperatures ) , ness is no longer a density matrix ( at least one of the eigenvalues becomes slightly negative ) hence the gibbs entropy is strictly no longer defined there . ]",
    "interestingly , we find ( see figure [ fig : qmi ] ) that qmi saturates @xmath299 in the non - lrmc phase ( for @xmath216 ) , whereas in lrmc phase ( for @xmath214 ) qmi becomes extensive @xmath300 indicating a drastic enhancement of correlations in ness .",
    "this is again very similar to the behaviour of _ operator space entanglement entropy _ ( osee ) ( analized for the lindblad model in @xcite ) , so one may extend the relationship between qmi and osee which has been conjectured for thermal states in ref.@xcite to ness .     and @xmath301 ( lightest blue , saturated curve ) , @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath304 ( from lighter to darker blue curves ) .",
    "thin red lines indicated the linear growth of qmi for @xmath305 . ]    in the context of energy transport it is interesting to look at the energy density profiles in ness . in figure",
    "[ density ] we plot the relative spatial fluctuation of the energy density @xmath306 where @xmath307 is the averaged energy density .",
    "quite strikingly , we observe a big variation of @xmath308 from site to site for lrmc phase and very smooth ( non - fluctuating ) behaviour for the non - lrmc phase which is characterized with a bulk - constant @xmath308 which is exponentially small in @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour can again be considered as a manifestation of hypersensitivity of ness and lrmc .     where @xmath309 is the bulk average of energy density @xmath310 .",
    "three curves correspond to @xmath207 and @xmath311 ( black curve ) , @xmath253 ( dark blue curve ) and @xmath312 ( light blue curve ) , while the system size is @xmath313 . ]     versus the coupling strength @xmath12 for the non - equilibrium thermal redfield model of an open xy chain with @xmath314 ( black curve ) , @xmath253 ( dark blue curve ) and @xmath315 ( light blue curve ) , system size @xmath316 and other bath parameters as given in the text .",
    "note that the full line gives numerically excellent fit to the karevski and platini formula @xcite @xmath317 for best fitted parameters @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and @xmath320 for the three cases of @xmath321 , respectively . ]",
    "at last we check the dependence of the heat current @xmath273 on the system - bath coupling strength @xmath12 .",
    "it was recently reported by karevski and platini @xcite that the _ spin current _ @xmath322 in the local lindblad model of an open isotropic xx chain @xmath323 has a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath12 which can be universally described by a formula @xmath324 where @xmath325 are some constants .",
    "for the anisotropic xy model and general non - equilibrium thermal redfield driving we are unable to derive an exact analytic result , however our numerical simulations suggest a very similar behaviour for the heat current @xmath326 where @xmath327 are again some constants which may depend on all system s parameters except @xmath12 .",
    "this is particulary interesting as in the anisotropic xy model the spin current is not even well defined as there is no corresponding conservation law .",
    "this behaviour is demonstrated in figure [ karevski ] where on may also notice small but detectable deviations between numerics and the best fit to ( [ eq : karformula ] ) .",
    "we note that the error of the fit does not decrease but is roughly constant when we increase the system size @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper was three - fold .",
    "firstly , we have outlined a general method for exact treatment of quadratic many - body markovian master equations .",
    "our formalism , which rests upon treating density operators as elements of a suitable operator fock space ( or liouville - fock space ) is quite flexible and allows for explicit solution of static and time - dependent quantum many - body liouvillean problems , for example computation of arbitrary physical obsevables in the non - equilibrium steady state , decay rates of approach to the steady state , or even time - evolution of the density matrix of externally forced systems described by explicitly time - dependent liouvilleans , all with polynomial computation complexity in number of particles ( fermionic degrees of freedom ) .",
    "secondly , we have analyzed in detail the redfield model of thermal baths within our framework . in spite of the fact that the redfield model does not define a proper dynamical semigroup , namely it is not guaranteed to preserve positivity of the density operator ,",
    "we have confirmed that steady states typically correspond to proper ( positive ) density operators .",
    "tiny deviations from positivity have only been observed in some test cases for very small temperatures or very large couplings to the baths ( which anyway violate _ weak coupling assumption _ ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that coupling the central system with several thermal baths of the redfield type at different temperatures produces physically interesting non - equilibrium steady states , for example such states which carry non - vanishing heat current .",
    "we wish to stress this physically obvious but mathematically delicate point with a particular care , as we have found a qualitatively different result for lindblad - davies dissipators which generate proper dynamical semigroups and satisfy detailed balance condition with respect to gibbs states @xcite .",
    "namely when we constructed a lindblad - davies dissipator with respect to two baths with two different temperatures coupled to two ends of the system ( spin chain ) , we have found that the resulting steady state ( fixed point of the liouvillean dynamics ) is simply some convex combination of two gibbs states corresponding to the bath temperatues , and as such has always zero heat current and can not represent physical steady state .",
    "this implies that the _ secular approximation _ ( sometimes called the rotating wave approximation ) which is the one - step from the redfield to the lindblad - davies bath model prohibits the emergence of the physical out - of - equilibrium steady states with currents , therefore the seemingly harmless rapidly oscillating terms in the redfield dissipator may be absolutely essential for non - equilibrium physics .",
    "thus we conjecture that the thermal redfield model is somehow a minimal mathematical model which can describe non - equilibrium thermal driving of a ( non - self - thermalizing , e.g. integrable ) open quantum system .",
    "thirdly , we have applied our theory to analyze non - equilibrium quanutm phase transition and heat transport in an open xy spin 1/2 chain .",
    "we have carefully compared numerical results for the non - equilibrium thermal redfield model and the local lindblad model , which has been discussed before @xcite .",
    "we have found that the phase diagram of the non - equilibrium xy model is insensitive to the theory with which we describe the baths , and the differences were only quantitative . in particular",
    "we wish to stress that thermally driven heat current in the xy chains exhibits non - monotonic dependence on the temperature difference which may be interpreted as _ negative differential heat conductance_. we believe that our numerical results on non - equilibrium open xy chain provide a strong motivation for further analytical work .",
    "in particular , we believe that the block - tridiagonal plus block - bordered structure of the liouvillean structure matrix ( [ eq : struct1],[eq : bb ] ) could be explored in combination with the non - equilibrium green function formula for the observables ( [ eq : wwg],[eq : green ] ) to yield explicit asymptotic results for large @xmath0 .",
    "note added : formally quite similar approach to non - equilibrium quasi - particles has recently been developed independently by kosov @xcite .",
