    "a study of fluctuations in continuous media is of great interest in physics and it can provide a link between the macroscopic and microscopic points of view . a macroscopic theory such as hydrodynamics",
    "provides a simplest possible description of a complicated many - body system in terms of space - time evolution of the mean or averaged quantities like energy density , pressure , flow velocity etc .",
    "the fluctuation theory studies small deviations from the mean behavior and it can help in calculating correlation functions for the macroscopic variables@xcite . in context of relativistic hydrodynamics , results of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref.@xcite authors have studied the fluctuation in the contexts of general - relativistic navier - stokes theory .",
    "a more general framework of hydrodynamics described as the divergence type theory(dtt)@xcite was considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "it ought to be noted that recently in an interesting work in ref.@xcite , the authors have applied results of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the relativistic _ navier - stokes _ theory of hydrodynamics and calculated the two particles correlators for the one - dimensional hydrodynamics ( bjorken ) flow relevant for the relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic and lhc .",
    "the authors obtained several analytical results for two particle correlation functions .",
    "further , in ref.@xcite , the authors have studied the effect of thermal conductivity on the correlation function using the bjorken - flow .",
    "it should be noted here that it is well - known that relativistic navier - stokes theory exhibit acausal behavior and it can give rise to unphysical instabilities@xcite . however the causality can be restored if the terms with higher orders are included in the hydrodynamics as indicated by the maxwell - cattaneo law@xcite . indeed these issues do not arise in the second - order causal hydrodynamics theory developed by mller , israel and stewart ( mis)@xcite .",
    "form of the navier - stokes equations can be determined from the second law of thermodynamics @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the equilibrium entropy current@xcite . however ,",
    "in general it is not possible for an out - of - equilibrium fluid to have an equilibrium entropy current@xcite . in mis hydrodynamics out - of - equilibrium",
    "current can have contributions from dissipative processes like the effect of viscosity and the heat conduction .",
    "this has an interesting analogy with the irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "further the mis hydrodynamics has been extensively applied to study the relativistic heavy - ion collisions@xcite and also in cosmology@xcite .",
    "later this formalism was extended to include the effect of third order terms in the gradient expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the derivation of the mis equations from the underlying kinetic equation may not be unique , there may exist a more general set of hydrodynamic equations which may allow one to obtain mis equations as a special case@xcite .    finally , it should be mentioned here that although the divergent type theory ( dtt ) of relativistic fluid of geroch - lindblom@xcite allows for a consistent proof of causality and stability of its solutions , it is far from direct thermodynamic intuition . moreover ,",
    "the connection between the dtts and mis or other causal hydrodynamics theories is not yet clearly established .    in this work",
    "we apply onsager theory to mis equations and also to the hydrodynamics models developed by denicol , koide and rischke ( dkr ) @xcite , jaiswal , bhalerao and pal ( jbp)@xcite and other models based on mis approach @xcite .",
    "further , we apply these results to study the hydrodynamical evolution using 1 + 0 dimensional bjorken flow . in particular , we calculate the correlators using the onsager coefficients for various relativistic hydrodynamical theories .",

    "but in case of dtt kind of hydrodynamics , it is not clear if divergence of the entropy four - current can be expressed directly in terms of scalar product of the viscosity and heat - flux tensors .    in order to understand the evolution of the correlation functions in some details we have calculated the normalized correlation functions given by eqn.([96 ] ) for an expanding one - dimensional boost - invariant ( bjorken ) flow . in this case all the correlations are proportional to @xmath257 .",
    "however , the details of temporal evolution of @xmath258 varies with the choice of different hydrodynamical models . in figures ( 1 - 2 )",
    ", we plot the normalized correlation function @xmath223}$ ] ( eqn.[96 ] ) as a function of time @xmath195 , where [ e ] stands for mis , jbp , dkr , to ( third order ) and ns hydrodynamics .",
    "each figure has five kind of curves : the solid ( red ) color curve describes the navier - stokes case while the dotted - dashed ( blue ) , the dashed ( purple ) , the dotted ( green ) and large - dashed ( black ) curves respectively describe mis , jbp , dkr and to cases.the left panel shows the case when the initial value for the viscous stress @xmath259 , while the right panel represents the case when the initial value of @xmath144 same as the navier - stoke case",

    "in one such comparison the energy - independent cross - section @xmath239 [ see eqns .",
    "( [ 101 ] , [ 102 ] ) ] is kept same for all the different versions of the hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , one can write the viscosity coefficient for the different models of hydrodynamics as @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "thus the relation between different @xmath263 are given by the scaling : @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "in the another way of comparing @xmath223}$ ] , the ratio @xmath266 is kept same for the different models of the hydrodynamics , while the @xmath239 is varied for the different models .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows the case when the transport cross - section is kept same for all the models of hydrodynamics .",
    "the inset figure in all the diagrams shows the plots of correlation functions with better resolution in @xmath195 range between @xmath267 to @xmath268",
    ". cases ( a - b ) , ( c - d ) and ( e - f ) corresponds to @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "values of @xmath266 for other models can be found using the scaling relation discussed above . the initial temperature @xmath226 and initial time @xmath271 are respectively chosen to be @xmath272 and @xmath273fm / c .",
    "one can notice for figures 1(a - b ) that when @xmath274 is close to the minimum possible value ( @xmath275 ) , all the correlation overlaps with each other .",
    "this is expected as all the viscous hydrodynamics models should approach the ideal hydrodynamics limit when @xmath276 .",
    "figures 1(c - d ) corresponds to the case when @xmath277 , i.e. almost seven times larger than the most minimum value , the correlations only marginally differ from each other .",
    "overall difference between the correlation functions obtained using initial condition @xmath259 and @xmath278 is not significant .",
    "however , when @xmath259 case navier - stoke correlation slightly dominates over the correlation functions obtained using the causal models . while for the case when the initial value of @xmath144 is same as navier - stoke value , it is the mis correlation function dominates over the other correlation functions .",
    "figures 1(e - f ) , correspond to the case when @xmath266 almost twenty times larger than the minimum value . in figure 1(e ) the navier - stokes correlation first increases with time and then decreases .",
    "however , all the causal models correlation decreases with time .",
    "rise in the navier - stokes correlation can be attributed to the unphysical behavior noted in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "it may be possible to distinguish between the correlation function from the navier - stoke theory from the causal hydrodynamics models .",
    "however , the correlation function of the causal models overlaps with each other .",
    "but when the navier - stokes value for the initial stress @xmath279 is chosen for the causal models , all the correlation function first increases with time and later the plummet with time .",
    "this case can be considered to be unphysical as for all the hydrodynamics models initially @xmath280 .",
    "the condition @xmath280 violates the validity of the second order hydrodynamics .",
    "figure ( 2 ) corresponds to the case when the ratio of the viscosity coefficient to the entropy density is kept same for all the five models of hydrodynamics .",
    "cases ( 2a-2b ) , ( 2c-2d ) and ( 2e-2f ) respectively corresponds to the situation when @xmath281 equal to @xmath282 and @xmath270 .",
    "the initial temperature and the initial times are kept same as in the case for figure ( 1 ) .",
    "one can notice that as @xmath283 in eq.([96 ] ) remains same for all the hydrodynamical models , all the correlation functions , starts at the same initial value .",
    "this was not the case in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "otherwise the general features about the correlation function remain same as in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "moreover , we have changed the values of initial temperature and initial time . in these cases also",
    "the general features of the correlation function remains similar to those discussed in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "finally we would like to discuss the importance our results .",
    "we first like to note that in the present work we have extended the formalism to calculate hydrodynamic fluctuations given in ref@xcite to the relativistic causal theories .",
    "we have demonstrated that the form of the correlation functions in causal hydrodynamic theories remains same as in the relativistic navier - stoke case@xcite .",
    "this result is not expected apriori , as the underlying hydrodynamic equations for the causal theories@xcite are very different than the navier stokes equation . equations ( ( [ 27]-[29]),([47]-[49 ] ) , ( [ 57 ] ) , ( [ 65]-[67 ] ) , ( [ 82 ] ) and ( [ 85 ] ) ) can be employed to calculate the two particle correlators [ see ref@xcite ] , which can be compared with the experimental data .",
    "however , this would require the solution of inhomogeneous ( with noise term ) hydrodynamical equations ( of different types ) in 3-dimension .",
    "further , in the present example we have dealt with boost invariant one dimensional flow . however , for a non - central heavy - ion collision , the vorticity can play a significant role@xcite . the presence of finite vorticity can cause the difference in the evolution in the correlation function for the different models of hydrodynamics remains to be seen .",
    "one can notice from eq.([69 ] ) that vorticity can drive dynamics of the viscous stress in dkr hydrodynamics .",
    "however this will require to solve hydrodynamical equation in @xmath284 or @xmath285 dimensions .",
    "this is at present , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "finally the numerical example that we have considered here , we plot the correlation function vs time .",
    "however , this numerical result can not be compared with the experimental data .",
    "but , this can give us some idea about how the correlation - function of different hydrodynamics compare with each other .",
    "we find that the correlation functions obtained using various causal theories do not significantly differ from each other for a variety of values of initial conditions and @xmath266 .",
    "however , the correlation function obtained using ns - theory can have unphysical behavior for higher values of @xmath266 and the ns - correlation function differ from the correlation functions obtained using the causal hydrodynamics .",
    "we have studied fluctuations in various models of relativistic causal hydrodynamics .",
    "we have found that the general properties of the dissipative part of the energy - momentum tensor due to the viscosity and heat - flux play an important role in determining the onsager coefficients and the correlation functions .",
    "we find that the analytic form of the correlation functions remains same for all the causal hydrodynamics that considered here and do not depend explicitly on the relaxation time .",
    "further our numerical investigations also suggest that the qualitative behavior of the correlation functions for the various models of the causal hydrodynamics remains similar to those of the navier - stokes theory at least for a one dimensional boost - invariant flow .",
    "_ note added : _ after this manuscript was prepared , we have found in ref@xcite on arxiv that the authors have applied the fluctuation - dissipation relation to the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics with the memory effects .",
    "we have also found that in ref@xcite the authors have calculated hydrodynamic fluctuation for mis hydrodynamics .",
    "ours and their results match with each other . in this work",
    "@xcite the author has obtained dynamics of the noise - function , while in our approach the noise - function is assumed to be given .",
    "however , we believe that one can obtain the noise function dynamics from the arguments similar to the one given in ref@xcite to obtain the dynamics of dissipative fluxes .",
    "the authors ( ak , jrb ) would like to thank to prof .",
