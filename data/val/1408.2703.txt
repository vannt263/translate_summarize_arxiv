    "mechanical alloying / milling is a non - equilibrium process and corresponds to a widely used low cost technique to produce metaestable alloy phases , amorphous phases and intermetallics compounds from crystalline elementary powder mixtures . as a remarkable point , in the case when a single elementary powder is employed , mechanical milling is able to produce nanoparticles  @xcite , although it involves a complex process and requires optimization of a few parameters to obtain the required phase , absence of residues and control of the particle size .",
    "in general , nanoparticles ( nps ) are of great interest because they can be employed in a wide range of technological applications , from magnetic data storage to chemical and biomedical uses . considering biological applications ,",
    "the primary interest resides in the therapeutic potential of heat they can generate , since magnetic hyperthermia is a promising approach to cancer therapy .",
    "in particular , the well - known therapeutic procedure named hyperthermia corresponds simply to raising the temperature of a tumor up to @xmath1c , causing its necrosis without overheating and damaging the surrounding normal tissue . with this spirit",
    ", magnetic hyperthermia becomes an important issue because the ferromagnetic nps can generate heat at a localized area by different mechanisms ( hysteresis , eddy currents , nel switching , and brownian rotation ) when submitted to an external alternating magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the complete characterization of the particles becomes fundamental to obtain further information on the nature of the heating and dynamical magnetic behavior of the nanoparticles .    in this respect , several materials",
    "have already been studied and tested . in particular , most of them have low saturation magnetization , like ferri / ferromagnetic iron oxides nps  @xcite .",
    "however , the increase of magnetization provided by the metallic fe nps allows possibly more effective generation of local heat than , e.  g. , ferrimagnetic magnetite or maghemite , when subjected to an alternating magnetic field in a frequency range from @xmath2 khz to a few hundred khz .    in this sense ,",
    "fe nanoparticles are of great interest in technological applications due to properties such as high saturation magnetization value at room temperature and high reactivity . in fact , the last one can be a drawback for its application since fe nps are immediately oxidized through an exothermic reaction with air or water traces .",
    "therefore , their synthesis must be conducted under controlled atmosphere . to reduce or avoid problems with respect to the high reactivity of the fe particles ,",
    "passivation of the surface by an iron oxide layer has appeared as a valuable approach for the stabilization of such nps .",
    "the feo phase is thermodynamically stable only above @xmath3 k and under low partial pressures of oxygen .",
    "below @xmath3 k , the iron oxide decomposes into iron and magnetite . at low temperatures",
    ", there is the propensity that the iron is trivalent , avoiding the formation of stoichiometric feo when quenched to temperatures of @xmath4 k , in which it is metaestable with long life  @xcite .    in this paper , we report an experimental study on fe nps passivated in a wstite matrix prepared using high energy mechanical milling , in which the properties are investigated by x - ray diffraction , dynamic laser light scattering , mssbauer spectroscopy , field cooling and zero field cooling curves , magnetization curves , and magnetic hyperthermia .",
    "we identify that the produced sample is like fe nanoparticles embedded in a wstite matrix , with high stability in time , and shows noticeable features such as exchange bias effect at low temperatures and promising temperatures reached in a short time interval when considered magnetic hyperthermia , becoming an interesting candidate for biological applications , such as the one employed for cancer therapy .",
    "the studied sample , named fem40h , is a powder prepared using a planetary high energy mechanical milling fritsch pulverisette 7 - premium line system .",
    "the precursor material employed to produce the sample is fe powder ( @xmath5 purity ) from sigma - aldrich .",
    "the masses considered for the synthesis are @xmath6 g and @xmath7 g for fe and water , respectively .",
    "the milling is performed with a hardened steel vial with a total volume of @xmath2 ml .",
    "the ball to powder mass ratio is of @xmath8 and the rotation speed is of @xmath9 rpm .",
    "the balls and powder are deposited in the vial in normal atmosphere and are effectively milled during a time period of @xmath10 h , with standby time of @xmath11 min between each hour . the vial remains hermetically closed until reaching the whole milling time . at the end of the 40th hour milling time",
    ", the cap s vial is removed and it is allowed the sample to cool down to room temperature .",
    "phase characterization of the produced powder is carried out via x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a rigaku miniflex ii diffractometer , with cu k@xmath12 radiation of @xmath13 nm . diffraction measurement is performed in the angular range of @xmath14 , and the obtained xrd pattern is refined by rietveld method .    for measuring the particle size of the nps , dynamic laser light scattering is employed .",
    "the sample is dispersed in water , @xmath15 mg / ml , using a water - bath sonicator for @xmath16 min and the particle size is measured using a glass cuvette brookhaven instruments corporation zetaplus potential analyzer .",
    "the @xmath17fe mssbauer characterization is performed in the transmission mode in a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer from wiessel and using a @xmath17co(rh ) gamma ray source with activity of @xmath18 mci .",
    "the mssbauer spectroscopy ( ms ) measurements are performed at room temperature .",
    "isomer shifts ( iss ) are reported having as reference the is from @xmath12-fe at room temperature .",
    "magnetic characterization is obtained through zero field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) magnetization measurements as a function of the temperature , from @xmath2 k to @xmath19 k , as well as fc magnetization ( @xmath20 ) curves acquired at selected temperatures , with a quantum design model versalabtm vibrating sample magnetometer . in the fc magnetization measurements as a function of the temperature , a dc magnetic field of @xmath21 oe is applied , while for the fc @xmath20 magnetization curves , the sample is submitted to a dc magnetic field of @xmath11 koe and cooled down from @xmath19 k to the set temperature .",
    "finally , thermal characterization of the produced sample is performed via magnetic hyperthermia ( mh ) using a home - made system .",
    "the sample is submitted to an alternating magnetic field with frequency of @xmath22 khz and selected maximum amplitudes in the range between @xmath23 and @xmath24 oe . the temperature data acquisition is performed using an infrared thermometer with sampling rate of @xmath25 sample per second .",
    "the measurements are carried out at room temperature . in this case , the sample is thermally isolated from the solenoid and the temperature changes due to resistive heating are negligible since the whole system responsible by the field generation is refrigerated .",
    "in this section , we present the experimental results of the structural , magnetic and thermal characterization of the produced sample .",
    "figure [ fig_01 ] shows the x - ray diffraction patterns obtained for the fem40h sample and for the fe powder precursor material employed in the synthesis .",
    "the diffractogram for the fem40h sample is refined via the rietveld method . from the fit ,",
    "it is clear that the size and amount of the fe powder decreases with the milling time , since after @xmath10 h of milling only the ( @xmath26 ) fe peak is present , having a very low intensity when compared to the iron oxide phase .",
    "the result indicates that the produced sample is a two phases system , composed by wstite and @xmath12-fe , both with particles of reduced sizes .",
    "the fem40h sample contains a fraction of @xmath27 w% of @xmath28 nm wstite particles and @xmath28 w% of @xmath29 nm @xmath12-fe particles .",
    "in particular , the xrd pattern does not show any evidence of a third phase , namely magnetite or hematite .",
    "the lattice parameters @xmath30 for the @xmath12-fe and wstite phases are of @xmath31 nm and @xmath32 nm , respectively . according to results previously published for single crystals of iron oxide , fe@xmath33o , with variable stoichiometry , the lattice parameter found in our sample is related to a @xmath34 , as calculated from the formula @xmath35 , with @xmath30 in nm  @xcite .",
    "the iron oxide has a nacl - type crystal structure .",
    "although the ideal wstite uses to have cubic nacl structure , stoichiometric feo is unknown at normal pressure . the deviation from stoichiometry observed in our sample fe@xmath36o",
    "is related to cation vacancies and to ferric ions occupying octahedral and tetrahedral sites  @xcite .",
    "the number of these defects is so massive that complex interactions between them lead to the formation of defect clusters  @xcite .    as a remarkable point , after the first run of measurements and analysis , the sample was kept in capped plastic vials without any special enclosure .",
    "several weeks later , the xrd measurements have been repeated and it is found that the newer pattern is identical to that previously obtained for the fem40h sample , indicating that the relative mass concentrations for both phases are unchanged .",
    "this result shows that the wstite phase is stable and may be protecting the @xmath12-fe phase from oxidation .",
    "as previously mentioned , there are some missing fe@xmath37 ions at the wstite constitutional structure . to satisfy the charge neutrality , some ferrous ions oxidize to fe@xmath38 .",
    "this leads to the occupancy of fe@xmath38 in both octahedral ( @xmath39 ) and tetrahedral ( @xmath40 ) interstitial sites  @xcite .",
    "thus , the chemical formula of wstite can be written in terms of the iron occupancy as : @xmath41_{1 - 3x } [ \\textrm{fe}^{3 + } _ o]_{2x - t } [ \\textrm{fe}^{3 + } _ t]_t [ \\square _ o ] \\textrm{o}^{2-}\\,,\\ ] ] in which @xmath42 is an octahedral cation vacancy , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 measure the proportion of missing @xmath39 and @xmath40 iron ions .",
    "figure [ fig_02 ] shows the dynamic laser light scattering analysis for the fem40h sample . whereas the @xmath12-fe and fe@xmath36o crystallite size calculated by analyzing the xrd peaks are of @xmath29 and @xmath28 nm , respectively , here , the obtained mean particle size is @xmath45 nm . in this case , the larger particle size measured through this technique , which indicates the hydrodynamic diameter , is associated to @xmath12-fe particles embedded in a polycrystalline matrix of fe@xmath36o .",
    "this may be a consequence of aggregation of the nps , a fact commonly verified in milled samples due to successive processes of cold welding between the particles .",
    "mssbauer spectroscopy is an attractive technique to study the produced sample due to the presence of iron cations in different environments .",
    "figure  [ fig_03 ] shows the room temperature mssbauer spectrum obtained for the fe powder and the fem40h sample . for the @xmath12-fe powder ,",
    "the ms shows only one component with hyperfine magnetic field ( bhf ) of @xmath46 t and is of @xmath47 mm / s . in the case of the fem40h sample ,",
    "the ms reveals a spectrum that can be modeled with five subspectra : a sextet related to fe , three doublets and a singlet related to wstite .",
    "the sextet has similar hyperfine parameters as the pristine sample , a result in agreement with the one usually verified for magnetically blocked @xmath12-fe particles . on the other hand ,",
    "wstite is paramagnetic at room temperature and antiferromagnetically ordered at temperatures below @xmath48 k  @xcite .    in previous studies on fe@xmath33o samples ,",
    "several physical models have been proposed to analyze the ms from samples with different @xmath49 values and prepared by sintering stoichiometric amounts of powdered fe@xmath50o@xmath51 and @xmath12-fe . for samples with @xmath52  @xcite ,",
    "the fitting model consists in one singlet ascribed to fe@xmath38 and two doublets related to fe@xmath37 at different distorted environments in @xmath39 sites . for samples with @xmath53  @xcite the model consists in one singlet due to fe@xmath38 in @xmath39 sites , two doublets associated to fe@xmath37 in @xmath39 sites and one doublet attributed to fe@xmath38 in @xmath40 site . here",
    ", we adopt the fitting model reported in references  @xcite , where the singlet is associated to o ferric ions , the two doublets are related to o ferrous ions located near to vacancies and interstitials cations .",
    "the fourth subspectra , doublet , is associated to fe@xmath37 ions occupying @xmath40 interstitial sites .",
    "the hyperfine parameters obtained from the fit are presented in table  [ table_01 ] .",
    "the values of area - wstite show the percentile of fe distributed at different environments in the fe@xmath36o phase .",
    "these values are calculated from the absolute areas obtained from the fits .",
    "substitutional octahedral fe@xmath38 ions , which are provided to allow charge neutrality , are subjected to a crystal field with cubic symmetry and thus the electric field gradient ( efg ) is zero at the iron nucleus  @xcite .",
    "since the fe@xmath37 radi is larger than fe@xmath38 ions , some of the fe@xmath38 ions at @xmath39 sites may diffuse to interstitial @xmath40 sites . at these sites ,",
    "the adjacent cation defects develop an efg which splits the i@xmath54 nuclear level , leading to a quadrupole interaction .",
    "the larger quadrupole splitting ( qs ) for fe@xmath38 at @xmath40 site must result from a lattice contribution to the efg .",
    "the fe@xmath37 ions are located at @xmath39 sites and exhibit hyperfine parameters typical for high spin fe@xmath37 .",
    "the parameters obtained are similar to the results reported for fe@xmath37 cations in a non cubic environment , probably due to vacancies as near neighborhoods of the fe@xmath37 ions  @xcite .",
    "the qs for the fe@xmath37 cations are larger than the ones reported in  @xcite , and this feature may be devoted to the high disorder degree induced by the milling process .",
    "the linewidths of all subespectra are broad , indicating that more than one site with slightly different parameter is represented by each component .",
    "the obtained relative absorption areas for the sextet and the subspectra ascribed to wstite are respectively of @xmath55% and @xmath56% .",
    "this result indicates a reasonable agreement with the mass percentage obtained from the xrd analysis .",
    "+     [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure  [ fig_04 ] presents the magnetization behavior of the produced fem40h sample as a function of the temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig_04](a ) shows the fc and zfc magnetizations measured in the temperature range between @xmath19 k and @xmath2 k. both zfc and fc magnetization measurements exhibit peculiar features , mainly in the temperature interval between @xmath57 k and @xmath58 k. in this case , for the fc curve , a broad peak is observed in this region , evidenced by the increase of the magnetization signal as the temperature decreases from @xmath19 k to @xmath58 k , reaching the maximum value , and a subsequent decrease , until a nearly constant value below @xmath59 k. for the zfc curve , the magnetization continuously decreases as the temperature goes from @xmath19 k to @xmath2 k , in which a more intense decrease of the @xmath60 value is verified in the range between @xmath58 k and @xmath57 k.    the derivative of the zfc curve , presented in fig .  [ fig_04](b ) , indicates that the maximum of variation occurs at @xmath61 k , being this value close to the nel temperature of the wstite phase . for temperatures above @xmath58",
    "k , the condition of derivative close to zero is satisfied indicating that the system becomes magnetically blocked at this temperature .",
    "the zfc and fc curves separates at temperatures below @xmath19 k , it can be attributed to the existence of magnetic anisotropy barriers in the @xmath12-fe phase .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that because wstite is not stoichiometric , some ferro / ferrimagnetism is expected due to their uncompensated magnetic moments , thus the sudden increase at @xmath58 k in magnetic signal in the zfc and fc curves could be related to this contribution .",
    "small @xmath12-fe nps use to exhibit anisotropy energies with one or two orders of magnitude larger  @xcite than the bulk one , whose value is @xmath62 j / m@xmath63 .",
    "thus , by using the well - known equation @xmath64 , it is possible to estimate the blocking temperature @xmath65 from the magnetic anisotropy . in this case , considering @xmath66 j / m@xmath63 and fe nps with diameters of @xmath29 nm , we obtain @xmath67 k. in this sense , the calculated @xmath65 seems to indicate that the particles may be already blocked at @xmath19 k.     +     figure  [ fig_05 ] presents the magnetic properties of the produced fem40h sample as a function of the magnetic field at selected temperatures . in this case , fig .",

    "all the hysteresis loops reach the saturation at magnetic field @xmath70 koe . at higher fields ,",

    ", it is verified a noticeable increase as the temperature is reduced , from @xmath73 to @xmath74 oe .",
    "the exchange bias field quantifies the magnetic coupling effect between the phases and is defined by @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 being the points where the loop intersects the axis of the applied field .",
    "since the exchange bias effect is observed and the magnetization curves are shifted , the coercive field is calculated according to @xmath78 .",
    "the field cooling hysteresis performed at @xmath68 k and @xmath58 k did not show exchange bias effect , but below @xmath58 k , the @xmath72 values continuously increases .",
    "thus , it is clear that the exchange bias effect is a result of the coupling of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials composing the sample .    at higher fields , @xmath79 koe ,",
    "magnetization saturation @xmath80 can be calculated by fitting the magnetization data using the expression @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the magnetic susceptibility of the antiferromagnetic phase . from this point ,",
    "considering the obtained @xmath80 value and assuming that the saturation magnetization for the @xmath12-fe is m@xmath83 emu / g  @xcite , it is possible to calculate the @xmath12-fe mass contribution to the magnetic signal .",

    "it is known that the heating effect strongly depends on the magnetic particle s properties , measurement conditions , particle size distribution and particle dispersion , as well as on the experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_06](a ) shows the plot of the temperature of the fem40h sample as a function of the time in a magnetic hyperthermia experiment in which the external alternating magnetic field with frequency of @xmath22 khz and maximum amplitude varying between @xmath23 to @xmath24 oe is employed .",
    "in particular , it is verified a clear dependence of the reached temperature with the field amplitude , as expected .",
    "however , the most striking feature resides in the temperature reached when the sample is submitted to an alternating field with amplitude of @xmath89 oe . in this case , the temperature increases up to @xmath0c in a short time interval , @xmath90 s.    thus , due to this reached temperature value , the time interval of temperature elevation , high stability of the fe particles in time , the produced fe nanoparticles embedded in a wstite matrix powder becomes an interesting candidate for biological applications , such as the one employed for cancer therapy , since they are in principle suitable for heat ablation of cancer cells and the maximum value to preserve healthy tissues .    for purpose of discussion , here",
    ", we assume that the specific absortion rate ( sar ) , which is the amount of energy absorbed from an alternating magnetic field and converted to internal energy per time unit per fe mass unit , verified through an increase of temperature of the sample , can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the iron s heat capacity , @xmath93 is the initial slope of the @xmath40 vs.  curve @xmath44 presented in fig .",

    "the sar values vary from @xmath15 to @xmath96 w / g .",
    "these values are in quantitative agreement with the ones obtained using similar experimental conditions for nanoparticle systems grown by evaporating targets of fe and fe@xmath51o@xmath97 with different stoichiometry  @xcite .",
    "the reduced values can be related to several factors . as a first point ,",
    "high particle concentration is employed in the experiment , due to the considerable fe mass .",
    "second , since the field applied in the hyperthermia experiment is smaller than the coercive field of the sample , it is expected that the just part iron nanoparticles are responsible by the magnetization changes in this field interval , i. e. , a considerable portion of the fe nps are not contributing to the sample heating .",
    "third , nel switching mechanism can not be considered because the nanoparticles are not in the superparmagnetic regime , as well as the brownian mechanism is largely irrelevant , since our sample is a powder non - immersed in an aqueous medium  @xcite . anyway , despite the sar values , very interesting temperatures can be reached in a reduced time interval , similarly to several results find in literature  @xcite .",
