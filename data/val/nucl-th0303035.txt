    "notice that in some of our earlier afdmc calculations we have used @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 , as given in the original papers proposing the urbana ix potential @xcite and the @xmath1 model interaction @xcite .",
    "changing @xmath56 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 leads to a @xmath59 additional increase of the three - body force contribution in neutron matter . in the following",
    ", we will denote with @xmath60 the @xmath1 plus urbana ix interaction , with @xmath61 the @xmath2 plus urbana ix interaction .",
    "we have also considered the recently developed illinois three - body potentials , which include two @xmath62 intermediate state diagrams @xcite , and denoted with il1,@xmath63 , il4 .",
    "standard green s function or diffusion monte carlo methods for central potentials sample only the particle positions since the spin or isospin of the particles can be fixed .",
    "the green s function monte carlo method used in light nuclei also samples the particle positions , but a complete description of the spin degrees of freedom is kept for each position sample leading to an exponential growth of the number of spin - isospin states with particle number @xmath13 .",
    "this exponential behavior can be removed by sampling rather than summing the spin - isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "we define a walker to be the @xmath64 coordinates of the @xmath13 particles and @xmath13 spinors each giving the four amplitudes for a particle to be in the proton up , proton down , neutron up and neutron down states . for the special case where walkers are sampled from the usual neutron - proton up - down basis",
    ", the spinors would be one of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for each particle .",
    "our auxiliary field method requires the more general definition as shown below .    as usual ,",
    "the overlap of the walker bra with the trial ket is the wave function amplitude , @xmath69    direct sampling of the spin - isospin in the usual spin up / down basis requires a good trial function that can be evaluated efficiently .",
    "this can be most easily seen for the variational formalism , but the same analysis applies to green s function or diffusion monte carlo .",
    "a variational monte carlo calculation can be formulated by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian , @xmath70 where for a @xmath3 interaction we would have @xmath71 + \\langle r s ' | v | r s \\rangle \\ , , \\ ] ] with a straightforward generalization for spin - orbit terms .",
    "variational monte carlo can be implemented with either spin sums @xcite @xmath72 or spin samples @xcite @xmath73 in these equations , @xmath38 is the probability density to be sampled and @xmath74 is the local energy . a typical variational calculation would use the metropolis algorithm to sample either @xmath75 or @xmath75 and @xmath37 from @xmath38 , and average the value of the local energy over these samples .",
    "notice that for an eigenstate of @xmath76 , both @xmath77 and @xmath78 are constant .",
    "so , as for central potentials , the variance will be low if the trial function is accurate .",
    "notice also that the spin sum @xmath79 in the definition of @xmath77 is polynomial rather than exponential in @xmath13 .",
    "for example a pair potential will have only order @xmath80 terms where two particles have different spin - isospin .",
    "the variance per sample for complete spin sums will be lower than for spin samples .",
    "however , since the spin sums grow exponentially with particle number spin sampling should be more efficient for large particle number if the trial function can be evaluated efficiently for a single many - particle spin state @xmath37 .",
    "unfortunately , all of the good trial wave functions currently used for large numbers of particles can not be evaluated efficiently for a single many - particle spin state @xmath37 .",
    "for example light nuclei variational monte carlo calculations are typically done using a pair product ( or more complicated ) wave function , @xmath81    operator products , and @xmath82 is the antisymmetric model state .",
    "while the symmetrizer produces all possible orderings of the operators and therefore gives @xmath83 terms , normally the commutator terms are fairly small and the ordering of the operators is sampled .",
    "however , even within a fixed ordering , each operator in the product term when operating on a single many - particle spin - isospin state will produce 4 or 8 new states depending on whether isospin exchange gives a new state .",
    "@xmath84 operators out of the @xmath85 total acting on a single state are enough to populate all the states",
    ". therefore a straightforward evaluation of @xmath86 , for this wave function will have the same computational complexity as evaluating a complete set of spin - isospin states at the position @xmath75 . since computing all the states have the same cost as a single state , full spin sums",
    "are used for these calculations .",
    "if good trial functions for spin - isospin dependent interactions can be devised which can be evaluated or sampled efficiently at a single many - particle space position and spin - isospin state , straightforward generalizations of standard central potential monte carlo methods , both variational and green s function , with spin - state sampling will solve the nuclear many - particle hamiltonian .",
    "since direct evaluation of the pair product wave function is not computationally feasible for large numbers of particles , and so far we have no good methods of sampling these wave functions , we instead drop the operator terms altogether and sample the spin - isospin variables using a rather poor , but easy to evaluate , wave function . since this wave function does not contain amplitudes of the spin states of the correct solution we can not use it to sample the spins .",
    "instead , we rewrite the propagator as an integral over auxiliary fields using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xmath87 where @xmath88 can be a one - body operator . to make use of this transformation we write our propagator as the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq.hs ] , so that the integrand of the right hand side is a product of one - body terms .",
    "the integrand has a form such that propagating a walker at @xmath89 results in another walker of the same form at @xmath90 .    for @xmath91 neutrons ,",
    "the @xmath3 two - body interaction can be split into two parts @xmath92 where roman subscripts like @xmath21 and @xmath22 are particle labels while greek subscripts like @xmath11 and @xmath93 are cartesian components .",

    ", the short time approximation for the propagator can be written as    @xmath103    the @xmath102 do not commute , so we need to keep the time steps small so that the commutator terms can be ignored .",
    "we sample a value of @xmath104 for each of the @xmath64 auxiliary field variables .",
    "once these values are known , the propagation reduces to a rotation in the spin space , and , therefore , to multiplying the current spinor value for each particle by the set of matrices given by the transformation above . for a given eigenvalue @xmath105 in eq.([eq6 ] ) the spin states of particle @xmath22 , @xmath106 will be rotated to the new one @xmath107 having the following components    @xmath108    where @xmath109    and @xmath110 is the sampled hubbard  stratonovich value . for positive values of @xmath111 ,",
    "one has a similar set of equations , in which @xmath112 is substituted with @xmath113 .",
    "finally it is worth mentioning here that importance sampling has been used for the integral in the hs variables .",
    "the value of the overlap of the walker with the trial function will not be peaked around @xmath114 , but will be shifted . rather than sampling from the gaussian",
    "we preferentially sample values where we predict the trial function will be larger .",
    "one way is to shift the sampled gaussian values with a drift term analogous to the drift term in diffusion monte carlo by replacing the @xmath115 operators by their expectation value at the current @xmath116 value and taking the real part .",

    "it simply changes the strength of the coefficients of the terms in the potential and can be trivially incorporated in the afdmc calculations .",

    ", the afdmc method has a fermion sign problem .",

    "both give about the same results , within error bars , and we report values where the real part is positive . for spin independent time reversal",
    "invariant potentials both reduce to the fixed - node approximation .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if the sign of the real part is that of the correct ground state , we will get the correct answer and small deviations give second order corrections to the energy .",

    "it seems likely that there is not an upper bound theorem for the mixed estimate of the energy .",
    "if forward walking or a path integral ground state technique @xcite is used , the method simply produces a better trial function and the energy must be an upper bound .    in the fixed node method @xcite the nodal structure of the trial function is determined by the slater determinant .",

    "( [ jastrow ] ) .",
    "the jastrow function therefore affects only the variance and not our final results .",
    "monte carlo calculations are generally performed within the sphere of radius @xmath156 , where @xmath152 is the length of the box side .",
    "usually tail corrections are estimated by integrating out the spin ",
    "independent part of the two  body potential from @xmath156 up to infinity .",

    "our results are therefore already tail corrected .",
    "we found that the standard way of treating tail corrections leads to results very close to ours , except when we consider model interactions which contain tensor forces , which are relatively long range forces .",
    "the three body potential is not treated as the two body one .",
    "here we have estimated the tail corrections to the three body potential from the pbfhc variational results described in [ sec.fhnc ] .",
    "this analysis shows that such corrections are already very small for systems with 66 nucleons .",
    "finally , in this subsection we give the schematic structure of the afdmc algorithm .",
    "1 .   sample @xmath164 initial walkers from @xmath165 using metropolis monte carlo .",
    "2 .   propagate the spatial degrees of freedom in the usual diffusion monte carlo way with a drifted gaussian for half a time step .",
    "3 .   for each walker , diagonalize the potential matrix ( two and three  body terms ) .",
    "4 .   loop over the eigenvectors , sampling the corresponding hubbard - stratonovich variable and update the spinors for half a time step . introduce approximate importance sampling of the hubbard - stratonovich variables , as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "propagate the spin ",
    "orbit , using importance sampling . 6 .",
    "repeat 2 , 3 , and 4 in the opposite order to produce a reversible propagator to lower the time step error",
    "combine all weight factors and evaluate the new value of @xmath166 .",
    "if the real part is less than 0 include the walker in the evaluation of the mixed and the growth energies , and then enforce constrained path by dropping the walker .",
    "in general , the importance sampling makes the number of dropped walkers small .",
    "evaluate the averages of @xmath166 , and @xmath167 to calculate the mixed energy .",
    "repeat as necessary .",
    "in this section we present the method that we have used to estimate the finite size effects in afdmc simulations .",
    "such a method is made necessary by the fact that simulations with more than 100 nucleons are computationally very demanding .",
    "a many  body theory , like fhnc , based on integral equation techniques , in which the number of particles in the simulation box has no practical limitation seems to be the best candidate to do this .",
    "fhnc theory was originally developed @xcite to treat fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , fhnc has been recently reformulated to deal with a finite number of fermions in a periodic box , as those used for the monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "such a theory , denoted as periodic box fhnc ( pbfhnc ) , is based upon the fundamental property of the fhnc cluster expansion to be valid at all @xmath168 order @xcite , and it has been developed for jastrow  correlated wave functions . in the cases of a nucleonic system interacting via a central potential",
    "it has been shown that finite size effects are ( i ) not limited to the kinetic energy expectation value , and ( ii ) rather accurately estimated by pbfhnc calculations @xcite",
    ".    however , realistic correlations @xmath169 are spin  dependent and have an operatorial structure similar to that of the two  body potential , as in eq.([ham_arg ] ) ( where the component @xmath170 corresponds to the jastrow correlation ) .",
    "therefore the pbfhnc developed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be used as such , but has to be generalized to treat spin",
    " dependent correlations .",
    "the main problem is that the spin operators involved do not commute , namely @xmath171 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "this feature makes a full fhnc summation impossible and one has to resort to reasonable approximations for the spin  dependent correlations .",
    "such approximations are characterized by the fact that , whereas the cluster diagrams containing scalar correlations only are summed up with fhnc technique , only a limited set of cluster diagrams containing spin ",
    "dependent correlations are included in the calculation .",
    "the most tested and used approximation is the so called fhnc / soc , described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our calculations",
    "we have used the version adopted in @xcite in order to compute the different correlation functions @xmath172 at the various densities considered .",
    "we have considered only the three variational parameters corresponding to healing distance , @xmath173 , of central ( @xmath174 ) and spin - orbit correlations ( @xmath175 ) , the healing distance , @xmath176 of tensor correlations ( @xmath177 ) , and the quencher , @xmath178 , of the spin - isospin dependent correlation .",
    "the other variational parameters , like the spin  independent potential quencher and the correlation quenchers have been kept fixed at unity .",
    "optimal _ values of such variational parameters for pure neutron matter are shown in table [ tpar ] .",
    "they have been obtained by minimizing the average energy @xmath179 , where the two energy expectation values @xmath180 and @xmath181 refer to the jackson  feenberg and pandharipande  bethe kinetic energy expressions respectively @xcite . the usual constraint",
    "@xmath182 has been imposed in order to limit the range of variability of the free parameters in a region of reliability of the fhnc / soc approximation .",
    "we have verified that in such region the normalization condition is fulfilled within a few percent .",
