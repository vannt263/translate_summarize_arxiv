    "tunneling phenomena are inherent in numerous quantum systems , ranging from atom and condensed matter to quantum fields .",
    "therefore , the questions about the tunneling mechanisms are important .",
    "there have been many attempts to define a physical time for tunneling processes , since this question has been raised by maccoll @xcite in 1932 .",
    "this question is still the subject of much controversy , since numerous theories contradict each other in their predictions for `` the tunneling time '' .",
    "some of these theories predict that the tunneling process is faster than light , whereas the others state that it should be subluminal .",
    "this subject has been covered in a number of reviews ( hauge and stvneng @xcite , 1989 ; olkholovsky and recami @xcite , 1992 ; landauer and martin @xcite , 1994 and chiao and steinberg @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that there is a time related to the tunneling process has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , the results of the experiments are ambiguous .",
    "many of the theoretical approaches can be divided into three categories .",
    "first , one can study evolution of the wave packets through the barrier and get the phase time . however , the correctness of the definition of this time is highly questionable @xcite .",
    "another approach is based on the determination of a set of dynamic paths , i.e. , the calculation of the time the different paths spend in the barrier and averaging over the set of the paths .",
    "the paths can be found from the feynman path integral formalism @xcite , from the bohm approach @xcite , or from the wigner distribution @xcite .",
    "the third class uses a physical clock which can be used for determination of the time elapsed during the tunneling ( bttiker and landauer used an oscillatory barrier @xcite , baz suggested the larmor time @xcite ) .",
    "the problems rise also from the fact , that the arrival time of a particle to the definite spatial point is a classical concept .",
    "its quantum counterpart is problematic , even for the free particle case . in classical mechanics for the determination of the time the particle spends moving along a certain trajectory we have to measure the position of the particle at two different moments of time . in quantum mechanics",
    "this procedure does not work . from heisenberg s uncertainty principle",
    "it follows that we can not measure the position of a particle without alteration of its momentum . to determine exactly the arrival time of a particle",
    ", one has to measure the position of the particle with a great precision .",
    "because of the measurement , the momentum of the particle will have a big uncertainty and the second measurement will be indefinite . if we want to ask about the time in quantum mechanics , we need to define the procedure of the measurement .",
    "we can measure the position of the particle only with a finite precision and get a distribution of the possible positions .",
    "applying such a measurement , we can expect to obtain not a single value of the traversal time but a distribution of times .",
    "the question _ how much time does the tunneling particle spend in the barrier region ? _ is not precise .",
    "there are two different , but related questions connected with the tunneling time problem @xcite :    1 .",
    "how much time does the tunneling particle spend under the barrier ? 2 .",
    "at what time does the particle arrive to the point behind the barrier ?    there have been many attempts to answer these questions . however , there are several papers showing , that according to quantum mechanics the question ( i ) makes no sense @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the possibility to determine the tunneling time using a concrete model of time measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secimpos ] we prove that it is impossible to determine the time the tunneling particle spends under the barrier . in section [ secmod ]",
    "we present the procedure of the time measurement .",
    "this procedure leads to the dwell time if no distinctions between tunneled and reflected particles are made .",
    "this is shown in section [ secdwell ] . in section [ seccondprob ]",
    "we modify the proposed procedure of the time measurement to make the distinction between tunneled and reflected particles and obtain the tunneling time .",
    "the result of such a procedure clearly shows the impossibility of the determination of the tunneling time .",
    "however , it also gives the method of the asymptotic time calculation . in sections [ secprop ] and [ secrefltime ]",
    "we examine the properties of the tunneling and reflection times . in section [ secasympt ]",
    ", we derive the formula for asymptotic time .",
    "section [ secconcl ] summarizes our findings .",
    "to answer the question _ how much time does the tunneling particle spend under the barrier ? _ we need a criterion of the tunneling . in this paper",
    "we accept the following criterion : the particle had tunneled in the case it was in front of the barrier at first and later it was found behind the barrier .",
    "we require that the mean energy of the particle and the energy uncertainty must be less than the height of the barrier . following this criterion",
    ", we introduce an operator corresponding to the `` tunneling - flag '' observable .",
    "this operator projects the wave function onto the subspace of functions localized behind the barrier @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the heaviside unit step function and @xmath3 is a point behind the barrier .",
    "we call operator @xmath4 as the tunneling flag operator .",
    "this operator has two eigenvalues : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath5 corresponds to the fact that the particle has not tunneled , while the eigenvalue @xmath6 corresponds to the tunneled particle .",
    "we will work in the heisenberg s representation . in this representation ,",
    "the tunneling flag operator is @xmath7 to take into account all tunneled particles , the limit @xmath8 must be taken .",
    "so , the `` tunneling - flag '' observable in the heisenberg s picture is represented by the operator @xmath9 .",

    "we ask about the particles , which we know with certainty have tunneled .",
    "in addition , we want to have some information about the location of the particle .",
    "however , does quantum mechanics allow us to have the information about the tunneling and location simultaneously ?",

    "this means that we can not simultaneously have the information about the tunneling and location of the particle .",
    "if we know with certainty that the particle has tunneled then we can say nothing about its location in the past and if we know something about the location of the particle , we can not determine definitely whether the particle will tunnel . therefore , the question _ how much time does the tunneling particle spend under the barrier _ ? can not be answered in principle , if the question is so posed that its precise definition requires the existence of the joint probability that the particle is found in @xmath24 at time @xmath28 and whether or not it is found on the right side of the barrier at a sufficiently later time .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed in ref .",
    "it has been shown that due to non - commutability of operator there exist no unique decomposition of the dwell time .",
    "this conclusion is , however , not only negative .",

    "therefore , if the region @xmath31 is large enough , one has a possibility to answer the question about the tunneling time .",
    "from the fact that the operators @xmath26 and @xmath32 do not commute we can predict that the measurement of the tunneling time will yield a value dependent on the particular detection scheme .",
    "the detector is made so that it yields some value .",
    "but if we try to measure non - commuting observables , the measured values depends on the interaction between the detector and the measured system .",
    "so , in the definition of the larmor time there is a dependence on the type of boundary attributed to the magnetic - field region @xcite .",
    "we consider a model for the tunneling time measurement which is somewhat similar to the `` gedanken '' experiment used to obtain the larmor time , but it is simpler and more transparent .",
    "this model had been proposed by a. m. steinberg @xcite , however , it was treated in non - standard way , introducing complex probabilities .",

    "a very small parameter @xmath42 ensures the undisturbance of the particle s motion .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ interact ] ) with @xmath43 given by  ( [ delta ] ) represents the constant force acting on the detector * d * when the particle is very close to the point @xmath39 .",
    "this force results in the change of the detector s momentum . from the classical point of view , the change of the momentum is proportional to the time the particle spends in the region around @xmath39 and the coefficient of proportionality equals to the force acting on the detector . in the ordinary quantum mechanics",
    "there is no general method of the time determination .",
    "if we want to define such a method , we have to make additional assumptions about the time .",
    "it is natural to extend the classical method of the time determination into the quantum mechanics , too .",

    ", we consider a procedure of time measurement , proposed by a. m. steinberg @xcite .",
    "this procedure shows clearly the consequences of non - commutativity of the operators and the possibility of determination of the asymptotic time .",
    "our model also reveals the hartmann and fletcher effect , i.e. , for opaque barriers the effective velocity is very large , because the contribution of the barrier region to the time is almost zero .",
    "we can not determine whether this velocity can be larger than @xmath195 , because for this purpose one has to use a relativistic equation ( e.g. , the dirac s equation ) .",
    "due to non - commutativity of operators  ( [ tunflagheis ] ) and  ( [ posopheis ] ) the outcome of measurements depends on particular detector even in an ideal case .",
    "this makes the measurement of the tunneling time difficult for opaque barriers , because the tunneling time is very short and the term depending on the detector increases linearly with the barrier width .",
    "this term vanishes when the time spent in a large region , including initial packet location , is measured .",
    "i wish to thank prof .",
    "b. kaulakys for his suggestion of the problem , for encouragement , stimulating discussions and critical remarks .",
    "i am also indebted to the referee for the useful comments and suggestions for the improvement of this work .",
