    "potential models have been applied to explain quarkonium spectroscopy  @xcite in cave paintings dating from the mesolithic era of qcd  @xcite . in the beginning , they were based on parametrisations of the potential  @xcite which were  at best  qcd motivated and subsequently fitted to the observed spectrum . during the past few years , however , a two - body schrdinger - pauli - type hamiltonian incorporating the static potential and relativistic corrections due to spin dependent interactions as well as perturbations of the heavy quark propagator around the static wilson line has been derived directly from the qcd lagrangian to order @xmath8 in the heavy quark velocity  @xcite .",
    "one - loop matching coefficients with renormalisation group running between terms within the effective hamiltonian and qcd have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "non - qcd input has still been required until all non - perturbative potentials have recently been determined from quenched lattice qcd by one of the present authors  @xcite .",
    "parametrisations have been fitted to these lattice potentials enabling schrdinger - pauli - type solutions to be formed that are genuine predictions of ( quenched ) qcd .",
    "the spectroscopy for quarkonia shows similar behaviour to that obtained using quenched nrqcd ; however due to the use of a hamiltonian formulation of the problem the potential approach allows the calculation of a wider range of states than it is possible within nrqcd , in a manner that is both accurate and more robust against finite size effects ( fse ) .",
    "moreover , once the hamiltonian is obtained , the quark mass can easily be varied .",
    "we would like to mention that so far retardation effects have been neglected within the potential approach@xcite .",
    "however , it appears likely that such effects , which have their origin in radiation of ultra - soft gluons , can be incorporated into the potential formulation in a rather elegant and straightforward manner  @xcite that should automatically account for spin exotic states and mixing between quark model and hybrid states  @xcite .",
    "this work indicates that  at least for the lowest lying bottomonium states in the quenched approximation  such effects are tiny , which explains the good agreement of our results with lattice nrqcd predictions .",
    "the obvious drawbacks of the potential approach are ( a ) that it can not easily be extended to higher orders in the velocity where more and more non - potential type contributions will have to be included and ( b ) that  unlike hqet / nrqcd  it only applies to heavy - heavy systems .",
    "bottomonia systems are the ideal application and  having access to all excited states  we are indeed provided with much more insight than if we were just able to calculate the lowest few excitations .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the major sources of error in lattice calculations of the bottomonium spectrum .",
    "for simplicity , we will only employ cornell - type parametrisations of the potentials , neglecting a weakening of the effective qcd coupling at small quark separation .",
    "we study finite volume and discretisation effects by solving the order @xmath9 hamiltonian on ( three - dimensional ) lattices , varying the physical volume and lattice spacing .",
    "moreover , we study the size of relativistic and radiative corrections and estimate possible quenching effects by simulating the order @xmath9 and order @xmath8 hamiltonians in the continuum , using parametrisations of the potentials that are motivated by fits to quenched lattice data  @xcite .",
    "we shall argue that , in order to reproduce the observed spectrum correctly , the unquenched potential must have a significantly stronger effective coulomb coefficient at intermediate distances than determined within the quenched approximation , even when ignoring the weakening of this coefficient with the distance in the latter case .",
    "the principal effect of this is that observable quantities which exhibit a large sensitivity to the short distance potential ( e.g. states of small physical extent or fine splittings ) will yield results that are inconsistent with those obtained from states that are more sensitive to physics at larger distances .",
    "these discrepancies will depend on the mean radius of the state in a manner that is far less benign than the nave perturbative expectation of an enhanced slope of the logarithmic running of the coupling in the quenched approximation would suggest .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ expect ] we present some simple theoretical expectations for the spin averaged spectrum and comment on results from lattice spectroscopy investigations in view of these general considerations . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we discuss the methods used for solving the schrdinger - pauli equation both in the continuum and using a discrete lattice formulation with boundary conditions imposing various cubic group representations to fix the orbital angular momentum , before we present our results in sec .  [ result ] .",
    "we start with a discussion of systematic uncertainties imposed by truncating the expansion of the qcd lagrangian at a given order in @xmath10 as well as due to radiative corrections to the matching coefficients of operators of dimension higher than four .",
    "subsequently , results on the quarkonium spectrum as a function of the inverse quark mass with various effective coulomb coefficients around those suggested by quenched and partially unquenched lattice simulations are presented .",
    "the implications on the expected @xmath11 , @xmath12  mev , @xmath13  mev coulomb coefficient are discussed , and we rationalise both , the calculated mass dependence of the quenched @xmath14 splitting and the analysis methods common in lattice heavy quark simulations .",
    "finally , we proceed to a discussion of the dependence of the results on the lattice volume and spacing and characterise the likely finite volume errors and rotational symmetry restoration properties in the continuum limit of the lattice theory . in sec .",
    "[ summary ] , we summarise our results and present a brief outlook .",
    "navely one might expect that prior to a lattice simulation the lattice resolution @xmath15 , at which the real world will be studied , is selected . in practice , however , the theory is non - dimensionalised and simulated at a given value of the bare coupling .",
    "subsequently , the dimensionful lattice spacing is determined by matching an observable to its experimental value .",
    "if this observable depends on quark masses , the process of fixing the lattice scale can not be disentangled from the problem of adjusting the quark masses , and simultaneous matching of two or more quantities to experiment has to be performed .",
    "it is therefore common to either choose a non - hadronic quantity , such as  @xcite @xmath16 ( which is related to the static qcd potential ) or to choose quantities defined at almost vanishing quark mass , such as @xmath17 , to alleviate this problem . despite the significant difference between the mass of a charm and a bottom quark , the spin averaged @xmath14 splittings of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 systems",
    "are found to be essentially the same in experiment .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that , in the above mentioned sense , this splitting was a particularly good quantity to set the lattice scale @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the potential picture the spin averaged splittings scale as @xmath20 for a purely linear potential and as @xmath21 in the pure coulomb case . for a logarithmic potential , the splittings are independent of the quark mass ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with a string tension",
    "@xmath22  mev transition from one of these limits to the other sets in at a separation of order 0.5  fm , the static potential in the region @xmath23  @xmath24  fm being approximately compatible with a logarithmic parametrisation , which provides an explanation of the similarity between the spin averaged charmonia and bottomonia level splittings .    it has been reported in quenched simulations , however , that the @xmath14 splitting shows a significant slope as a function of  @xcite @xmath25 . moreover ,",
    "both the @xmath26 and @xmath14 splittings are found to be almost @xmath27 smaller than the experimental values if one sets the lattice spacing from light hadronic quantities  @xcite like @xmath17 or @xmath28 or the square root of the string tension 420  mev@xmath29  450  mev , as determined from regg trajectories .",
    "furthermore , calculations over a mass range extending above bottom have displayed a steep rise in the splittings  @xcite in the @xmath30 limit , starting somewhat above the @xmath5 quark . from the potential picture , this can be explained as follows : as one increases the quark mass beyond the bottom mass , the states under consideration move deeper into the coulomb region and splittings will diverge linearly in @xmath31 , while in the limit of light quark masses splittings should grow like @xmath32 .",
    "this suggests that the beauty and charm masses lie within a broad minimum of the @xmath14 and @xmath26 splittings , the extent of experimental agreement largely being accidental .",
    "of course in the limiting cases themselves , the potential picture will not be applicable : at light quark masses the description as a non - relativistic system breaks down while at extremely heavy quark masses , retardation effects will eventually dominate the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the relevant physical momentum scales that affect bottomonia masses differ from those of light hadronic quantities .",
    "neglecting sea quark loops in the quenched approximation alters the running of the qcd coupling , thereby resulting in large quenching errors when comparing quantities determined by different momentum scales  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the presence of two light flavours of dynamical fermions the disagreement between mass ratios determined on the lattice and in experiment appears to be reduced  @xcite .",
    "some authors , therefore , suggest to adapt the lattice scale @xmath15 to the system under consideration in order to reduce quenching uncertainities  @xcite .",
    "the `` different lattice spacings for different systems '' argument obviously reduces the predictive power of quenched and partially unquenched simulations while it does not even work consistently within the @xmath18 system : by integrating a schrdinger - pauli equation with quenched lattice potentials , the @xmath18 @xmath26 and @xmath14 have been found  @xcite to be significantly smaller than one would have expected from the value of @xmath33 .",
    "deviations between experimental and quenched lattice ratios between @xmath34 and splittings incorporating larger radial states like @xmath35 or @xmath36 , however , are found to be small  @xcite .",
    "the first observation is in agreement with lattice nrqcd results  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , nrqcd precision results are only available for the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath39 states , such that the above mentioned inconsistencies within the quenched @xmath18 spectrum are largely hidden behind statistical errors and , possibly , fse for @xmath40 or @xmath41 states .",
    "we remark that the relevant exchange momentum will in general not only depend on the system but also on the state under consideration .",
    "one should also keep in mind that within the non - perturbative regime universality of the qcd @xmath42-function is lost .",
    "therefore , interpreting differences between mass ratios determined within the quenched approximation and in full qcd as effects of an altered running of _ the _ strong coupling constant with _",
    "one _ relevant scale is an overly simplistic picture .",
    "we conclude that neglection of sea quarks results in a scatter between different scale determinations of up to 20  % , a systematic uncertainty of the quenched approximation that can not be _ repaired _ or discussed away .",
    "present day high precision data on the ( partially ) unquenched static qcd potential is limited to two light quarks with mass @xmath43  mev . apart from one very exploratory study  @xcite , determinations of relativistic corrections for dynamical fermions are completely missing . within statistical accuracy ,",
    "data on the static potential obtained with two flavours of wilson sea quarks as well as within the quenched approximation are compatible with the parametrisation , @xmath44 , down to distances as small as @xmath23  fm . from a fit to data with @xmath45  fm one of the authors has obtained @xmath46 in quenched simulations and @xmath47 in the two flavour case with @xmath48  mev  @xcite . if we allow for an additional term , @xmath49 , to mimic running coupling effects , we end up with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . the latter fits",
    "incorporate the running of the coulomb coefficient to distances @xmath52  fm , significantly less than the mean radius of @xmath53 , @xmath54  fm , but only affect the parameter @xmath55 slightly , in comparison to the change induced by `` switching on '' two sea quarks .",
    "we conclude that the renormalisation of the effective intermediate distance coulomb - coefficient is the dominant effect of unquenching , rather than the slightly different running of the coupling with the scale at large momenta .    for the sake of consistency with ref .",
    "@xcite we use the value @xmath56 throughout this article for what we call `` quenched '' while we estimate a value @xmath57 for what we consider to be the real world with three flavours of light quarks .",
    "it is apparent from both , lattice data on the @xmath14 splitting , and from the above information on the static potential that the coulomb term is indeed underestimated in the quenched approximation . in what follows",
    ", we will investigate the dominant effect of unquenching by just varying the coulomb coefficient in a cornell potential simulation .",
    "throughout this paper we only use the cornell - type parametrisation of qcd potentials , and neglect running coupling effects which would weaken the interaction at short distance .",
    "this means that we are likely to ( slightly ) overestimate fine structure splittings while the effect on spin averaged splittings is small .",
    "physical states with small spatial extent like the @xmath37 state should be thought of as being shifted into the direction of the corresponding prediction at somewhat weaker coulomb coupling . within this model",
    ", we estimate the sizes of various systematic effects , allowing conclusions on the degree of accuracy of lattice predictions on the @xmath18 system .",
    "quenching effects and the importance of relativistic corrections are studied by solving a continuum schrdinger equation by use of the numerov method . like in ref .",
    "@xcite , we start from the hamiltonian , @xmath58 + h_0 + \\delta h_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize kin } } + \\delta h_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize si } } + \\delta h_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize sd}},\\ ] ] with @xmath59 where @xmath60\\kappa\\right\\}\\frac{1}{r}.\\ ] ] the parametrisation , @xmath61 corresponds to the static qcd potential , the additional terms of eq .",

    "the potential results suggest that the disagreement within the @xmath18 spectrum as well as between determinations of the lattice spacing from light hadronic quantities and quarkonia level splittings will indeed be reduced in unquenched simulations . a determination of the minimal lattice resolution required to resolve the running of the qcd coupling sufficiently well for a precision determination of @xmath18 levels is the subject of an ongoing study  @xcite .    in fig .",

    "parametrisations for other states are consistent with small coefficients of @xmath195 terms too . while the finite size behaviour for @xmath198 states is monotonous , this is not the case for radial excitations anymore .",

    "[ fse3 ] we conclude that the second node of the wave function only fits onto the lattice for an extent slightly bigger than 1.2 fm , which explains the first turning point , while the second maximum of the wave function only starts to fit onto the lattice for @xmath203  fm , giving rise to the second turning point .    in figs .",

    "we investigate the restoration of the continuum symmetry as the lattice spacing is reduced .",
    "we pay particular interest to states within different representations of the cubic symmetry group @xmath109 that are expected to contain the same @xmath206 spin content .",
    "for instance , at a lattice spacing @xmath207  fm and infinite volume we find the @xmath183 state to be by 4  mev heavier than the @xmath184 state .",
    "unlike fse , finite @xmath15 effects critically depend on the form of the action employed . with our discretisation of the laplacian",

    ", we would only obtain such a potential with a perfect gauge action .",
    "in general , one would expect the static potential to suffer under discretisation errors too .",
    "insofar , the results stated here should be understood as mere lower limits on the discretisation errors of `` real '' lattice simulations of the @xmath18 spectrum .    as an illustrative example , in fig .",
    "[ finite3s ] , we display the spatial structure of the @xmath40 state for various lattice spacings . while the general structure of the wave function is still quite well reproduced , even at @xmath0  fm , the peaks themselves are not very well sampled anymore . in fig .",
    "[ finitea1 ] we extrapolate @xmath116 and @xmath117 states to the continuum limit .",
    "we observe that at finite lattice spacings all levels are somewhat underestimated  except for the @xmath37 level which turns out to be slightly overestimated .",
    "moreover , with increasing radial excitation @xmath99 , the slope of the extrapolation in @xmath93 decreases .",
    "the lines have been obtained from fits to the @xmath1 , 0.05 and 0.1  fm data points .",
    "this region is enlarged in fig .",
    "[ finitea2 ] .",
    "we interpret the overestimation of the @xmath37 level to be connected to the fact that we placed the origin  and therefore the singularity of the coulomb potential  at the centre of an elementary lattice cube .",
    "as we increase the lattice spacing , the @xmath116 waves sample less and less of the potential around the singular region and , therefore , we underestimate this negative contribution to the total energy .",
    "the same argument holds had we taken a potential measured on the lattice , instead of the continuum parametrisation , since in this case the singularity would have been naturally cut off by the lattice spacing too .",
    "the decrease of the slope of the extrapolation with increasing number of nodes of the wave function can be explained by an underestimation of the kinetic energy due to the reduced curvature on a coarse lattice .    in fig .",
    "[ finitea3 ] , we investigate how degeneracies of different representations of @xmath109 that correspond to the same @xmath206 spin content become restored in the continuum limit for @xmath182 and @xmath208 states .",
    "the @xmath119 state in the @xmath114 representation suffers less under both , finite @xmath15 effects and fse than that in the @xmath112 representation .",
    "this is possibly due to the less complex structure of the wave function ( fig .",
    "[ fse8 ] ) .",
    "we observe the same for @xmath121 wave functions in the @xmath111 representation .",
    "while all states are in nice agreement with the leading order @xmath93 expectation up to a resolution @xmath207  fm , higher order terms have a considerable effect at @xmath0  fm .",
    "this is in particular so for the @xmath209 state .",
    "we confirm that ratios of spin averaged bottomonium level splittings react in a sensitive way towards quenching .",
    "the main origin of this sensitivity is a renormalised overall - value of the intermediate energy effective qcd coupling , rather than an altered running of the coupling between different short distance scales .",
    "we find that the extent of agreement of spin averaged @xmath26 and @xmath14 splittings between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 systems is somewhat accidental . around the mass of the charm",
    "quark the slope of these splittings as a function of the inverse quark mass is quite significant but compensated for by a divergent term that gains influence within the region of the bottom quark mass .",
    "we have estimated systematic uncertainties of calculations of quarkonia level splittings based on order @xmath8 nrqcd due to @xmath210 correction terms .",
    "we end up with estimated accuracies of 12  % and 10  % on spin averaged @xmath18 and @xmath19 level splittings , respectively . for the fine structure ,",
    "our estimates are 35  % and a factor _ two _ , respectively .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty in all cases are radiative corrections to the matching coefficients of dimension five and six operators within the effective lagrangian , rather than higher order relativistic effects .",
    "unless non - perturbative matching methods become available , we have little control over the bottomonium fine structure . by incorporating existing one- and two - loop results",
    "the uncertainty can be somewhat reduced . however",
    ", a comparison of the predicted fine structure with experiment indicates that even higher order contributions are significant and likely to exceed our estimated effect of 25  % .",
    "a slow convergence of perturbation theory is indicated by a recent two - loop calculation of @xmath72 too  @xcite .",
    "we investigated finite volume effects , which we expect to be smaller for quarkonia than for light mesons .",
    "nonetheless , even for bottomonia , a linear lattice extent bigger than 2  fm is advisable , at least if one is interested in radial excitations , such as the @xmath41 or @xmath40 levels . except for the @xmath37 state",
    ", we failed to find simple parametrisations of the finite size behaviour of energy levels , based on superpositions of a power series in the inverse spatial volume , and contributions that are exponentially suppressed . a general result , however , is that the coefficients of terms proportional to @xmath195 come out to be smaller than those that accompany higher order corrections , which results in a rapid reduction of fse , once a critical volume has been by - passed .",
    "we regard this result as relevant for all mesonic physics on the lattice .    finally , we investigated finite lattice spacing effects .",
    "a non - vanishing spacing @xmath15 is required in lattice simulations of effective field theories to provide an ultra violet cut - off for gluon momenta , which means that the continuum limit can not be taken .",
    "an unwanted by - product of the lattice regularisation is the violation of the continuum rotational symmetry and dispersion relation . by parameterising the potential , obtained at finite lattice spacing , with a continuous rotationally symmetric curve and subsequently solving the hamiltonian in the continuum as well as on discrete lattices ,",
    "we have qualitatively investigated the finite @xmath15 behaviour .",
    "we find it worthwhile to simulate lattice nrqcd  where one is confined to lattice spacings in the region of the inverse quark mass  with different gluonic and fermionic actions and in particular to realise @xmath119 waves in both possible representations of the cubic symmetry group to gain control over discretisation errors .",
    "solving the schrdinger - pauli equation with lattice potentials on finite volumes provides us with a powerful tool to predict finite size effects in lattice simulations and to optimise smearing functions .",
    "the next step will be to extend the method to heavy - light systems within a bethe - salpeter framework which is theoretically not as rigorously founded as the potential approach for quarkonia but should still yield very valuable information on finite size effects and wave functions , which can then be used in lattice spectroscopy or determination of decay matrix elements .",
    "another extension is the inclusion of retardation effects and incorporation of a running coupling into the parametrisation .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
