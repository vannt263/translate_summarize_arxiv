    "background reduction is becoming more and more important for all the experiments looking for rare events , such as dark matter interactions , neutrino - less double beta decay ( 0@xmath2dbd ) , or rare @xmath3 decays . among the several technological approaches proposed for these searches , cryogenic calorimeters ( or bolometers )",
    "stand out for their excellent energy resolution ( of the order of 0.1@xmath4 ) and for the possibility of probing different compounds ; the crystals operated as bolometers can be grown starting from most of the possible 0@xmath2dbd candidates or rare-@xmath3 emitters , and from several interesting targets for dark matter search .",
    "bolometers can be equally sensitive to @xmath3 s , electrons and , if the threshold is low enough , also to nuclear recoils",
    ". this could be an advantage , as experiments designed for a specific purpose could be competitive also in other physics sectors . on the other hand , the lack of tools to identify the nature of the interacting particles prevents an efficient background suppression . a possible solution consists in equipping the bolometer with a light detector , that enables particle identification exploiting the different light emission of @xmath3 s , electrons and nuclear recoils .",
    "this technique has been successfully exploited for bolometers emitting scintillation light , like znse  @xcite , znmoo@xmath5  @xcite , limoo@xmath5  @xcite and many others .",
    "the scintillation crystals were coupled to light detectors made by thin germanium disks equipped with neutron transmutation doped germanium sensors , that show a typical intrinsic energy resolution of about 80ev rms  @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity is high enough to enable an efficient particle identification with scintillation bolometers , but may be not sufficient for next generation experiments",
    ". a possible application of new light detectors with these characteristics could be the upgrade of the cuore experiment .",
    "the teo@xmath6 bolometers used by this experiment do not scintillate . on the other hand , coupling a sensitive light detector to a teo@xmath6 would allow to measure the tiny amount of cherenkov light emitted by electrons ( about 100ev at 0@xmath2dbd energy ) and not by @xmath3 s , enabling the rejection of the dominant @xmath3 background  @xcite .",
    "the cupid interest group  @xcite , that is defining the road - map for a 0@xmath2dbd next - generation project based on bolometers , identified the features of the desired light detector : a noise rms resolution lower than 20ev , high radio - purity , large active area ( 5@xmath05@xmath1 ) and ease in fabricating / operating up to 1000 channels .",
    "the growing interest in developing sensitive light detectors ( that would be important also for other applications  @xcite ) gave birth to several r@xmath7d activities exploiting different technologies  @xcite .",
    "none of these technological approaches is ( yet ) able to fulfill all the requirements for next generation projects .",
    "for this reason , the calder ( cryogenic wide - area light detectors with excellent resolution",
    "@xcite ) project proposes a new technique , based on kinetic inductance detectors .",
    "kinetic inductance detectors ( kids ) are superconductors biased with an ac current  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the electric field applied to the superconductor is stored in the kinetic energy of cooper pairs .",
    "the oscillation of the field and , as a consequence , of the cooper pairs , produces an additional inductance in the superconductor , called kinetic inductance l@xmath8 . by coupling the superconductor with a capacitor",
    ", we can realize a rlc circuit , that acts like a resonator with resonant frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the properties of superconductors allow to fabricate resonators with typical quality factor ( q ) of the order of 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 .",
    "a photon interacting in the superconductor breaks cooper pairs , increasing the average momentum per cooper pair and , as a consequence , increasing l@xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the breaking of cooper pairs into quasiparticles increases the dissipation of the resonator , thus reducing q. monitoring the changes in the resonance parameters ( frequency and phase ) we can infer the energy that was deposited by the photon interaction .",
    "this is the working principle at the basis of kids that , besides an excellent energy resolution ( @xmath12ev ) bring the advantage of being naturally multiplexed in the frequency domain ; this means that hundreds of kids can be coupled to a single read - out wire , decreasing the number of electronics channels , as well as the heat - load on the cryogenic system .",
    "the main limit of this technology is that kids can feature a maximum active area of a few mm@xmath13 , while next generation experiments demand for light detectors with surface of tens of @xmath1 . in principle",
    ", we could realize a large area light detector with an array of hundreds of kids .",
    "this is not a realistic option , because photons do not interact efficiently in the superconductor and , in addition , the operation of about 1000 light detectors would require a very large number of kids ( hundreds of thousands ) .    for this reason , we deposit kids on an insulating substrate that is used to absorb the interacting photon .",
    "the absorption of a photon produces phonons , that travel in the substrate until they are absorbed by the kids or lost in the substrate supports or defects .",
    "the goal of the calder project is proving that this approach , proposed by swenson et al .",
    "@xcite and moore et al .",
    "@xcite for other applications , allows to realize a light detector with all the characteristics required by next - generation experiments .",
    "the project foresees three main phases .",
    "the fist stage is devoted to the development of all the necessary acquisition and analysis tools and to the optimization of the detector geometry . for this phase we decided to work with a well known material for kids applications , aluminum , that will allow to reach an rms energy resolution of about 80ev . in the second stage",
    "we will move to more sensitive superconductors , such as tin , ti+tin , or tial , in order to lower the energy resolution below 20ev .",
    "finally , we will couple the optimized light detectors to an array of teo@xmath6 bolometer to prove the potential of this technology .",
    "the aluminum prototypes , produced at consiglio nazionale delle ricerche istituto di fotonica e nanotecnologie ( cnr - ifn , rome , italy ) , are fabricated using direct - write electron beam lithography ( vistec ebpg 5000 ) .",
    "the resonators are deposited on high resistivity ( @xmath1410k@xmath15 cm ) si(100 ) substrates . for the first detectors we used 275@xmath16 m thick substrates , but we will investigate soon other thicknesses to better understand the efficiency in photons absorption and phonons propagation .",
    "the aluminum layer is evaporated in an electron - gun evaporator that allows to deposit the desired superconductor thickness ( 25 or 40 nm for the detectors described later ) .",
    "after the lift - off , we cut the si wafer into a 2@xmath02@xmath1 chip , that is assembled in a copper structure using insulating ptfe elements , as shown in figure  [ fig : photo ] .    a single al kid deposited on a 2@xmath02@xmath1 si substrate .",
    "the chip was assembled in a copper structure using four ptfe elements . ]",
    "the detectors are cooled below the critical temperature using a @xmath17he/@xmath10he dilution refrigerator with base temperature of about 10mk .",
    "the output signal is fed into a citlf4 sige low noise amplifier  @xcite , which is thermally anchored to the 4k plate of the cryostat .",
    "the rest of the electronics is located at room temperature and its features , together with the description of the cryogenic facility and the acquisition software , can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "we developed several analysis tools to fit the complex transmission function s@xmath18 in order to extract useful parameters , like the resonance frequency , the quality factor q , the internal and coupling quality factors q@xmath19 and q@xmath20 ( q@xmath21=q@xmath22+q@xmath23 ) . taking advantage from the analysis done by swenson et al .",
    "@xcite and khalil et al .",
    "@xcite , we developed a model of the resonator that allows to extract the parameters of interest even in presence of large distortions produced , for example , by impedance mismatches between the feed - line and the chip  @xcite .",
    "the resonance fit allows to determine also the center and radius of the resonance loop .",
    "when an interactions occurs , the phase and amplitude of the resonance vary with respect to this reference frame , producing two readable signals .",
    "since the phase signal @xmath24 has a much better signal to noise ratio , we use this estimator to reconstruct the energy spectrum of the detector . according to our signal model ,",
    "an energy release e produces a phase variation @xmath24 : @xmath25 the first term in this formula is mainly material dependent : @xmath3 is the fraction of kinetic inductance ( of the order of 415@xmath4 for al ) , @xmath26 is a slow function of the temperature ( about 2.32.6 for our detectors ) , @xmath27 is the single spin density of states ( for al 1.72@xmath010@xmath28ev@xmath29 ) , and 2@xmath30 is the binding energy of cooper pairs ( about 200@xmath16ev for thin al films ) .",
    "the second term , containing the resonator @xmath31 and active volume @xmath32 , depends mostly on the geometry of the device and can be easily varied up to an order of magnitude . finally , @xmath33 is the detection efficiency .      to measure the efficiency of our device",
    ", we performed several tests using a 2@xmath02@xmath1 , 275@xmath16 m thick silicon substrate .",
    "the substrate was illuminated with an optical source ( 400 nm room - temperature led coupled to an optical fiber ) producing pulses up to @xmath1230kev , and with @xmath34fe/@xmath35co x - rays sources with peaks between 5.9 and 14.4kev , in order to cross - check the results .",
    "the calibration of the optical apparatus , indeed , is made with a photomultiplier at room temperature and is corrected using a monte carlo that accounts for the geometry of the set - up and for the optical properties of si . on the contrary , the nominal energy of x - rays is known with high precision , allowing to investigate possible systematic errors in the calibration of optical pulses .",
    "all the sources were always placed on the back of the substrate to prevent direct illumination of the resonators .",
    "since we expect the efficiency to scale with the detector volume , we tested different kids geometries : ( 1 ) a 25 nm thick al kid with active area of 2.4mm@xmath13 , ( 2 ) a 40 nm thick kid with the same active area , and ( 3 ) a 40 nm thick kid with an increased active area of 4.0mm@xmath13 .",
    "the results , reported in table  [ tab : efficiency ] , were obtained by illuminating the substrate in the proximity of the resonator , or as far as possible from it .",
    ".[tab : efficiency]number of kids deposited on the 2@xmath02@xmath1 si substrate ; thickness ( t ) and area ( a ) of the inductor ; total detection efficiency measured with optical pulses illuminating the substrate region close to the kid ( @xmath36 ) and far from the kid ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have already realized a single pixel detector with geometry ( 3 ) by depositing ti+al ( 10 nm of ti and 25 nm of al ) on a 2@xmath02@xmath1 si substrate . the first prototype , that was produced in collaboration with csnsm ( orsay , france ) and institut nel , cnrs ( grenoble , france ) , is currently being tested and shows very encouraging results .",
    "in this paper we presented a novel technology for the development of sensitive light detectors , based on phonon - mediated kids .",
    "we presented the results obtained depositing prototypes of al kids with different geometries on 2@xmath02@xmath1 si substrates and we derived the detection efficiency .",
    "we evaluated the noise of the detectors and showed that the optimization of the design allowed to reach a baseline noise of about 90ev rms .",
    "finally , we discussed the perspectives of this technology , explaining how more sensitive superconductors will allow to reach the target sensitivity .",
