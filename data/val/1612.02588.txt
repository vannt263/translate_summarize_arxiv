    "dwarf galaxies are the most abundant type of galaxies in the universe , spanning a huge range in stellar mass , luminosity and surface brightness .",
    "they come in two main flavours : dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) and dwarf spheroidal / ellipticals ( dsph / des ) .",
    "these are distinguished principally by the significant interstellar medium ( ism ) in dirrs and almost complete lack thereof in dsphs / des , but their star formation histories also differ , with dirrs being `` younger '' ( battinelli & demers 2006 ) .",
    "most dsph / des are located in the dense inner regions of galaxy groups and clusters , close to massive spiral or elliptical galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "dirrs are often more isolated .",
    "this strongly suggests that environmental effects transform dirrs into dsph / des .",
    "the star formation history ( sfh ) is one of the most important tracers of the evolution of galaxies .",
    "we have developed a novel method to use long - period variable stars ( lpvs ) to reconstruct the sfh , which we have successfully applied the local group galaxies m33 ( javadi , van loon & mirtorabi 2011 ; javadi et al .",
    "2016 ) and the magellanic clouds ( rezaeikh et al .",
    "the most evolved stars with low to intermediate mass , at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) show brightness variations on timescales of @xmath1 to @xmath2 days due to radial pulsation .",
    "lpvs represent the most luminous phase in their evolution , @xmath360,000 l@xmath4 , and reach their maximum brightness at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "intermediate - mass agb stars may become carbon stars as a result of the dredge up of carbon synthesized in the helium thermal pulses ; the resulting change in opacity reddens their colours .",
    "since the maximum luminosity attained on the agb relates to the star s birth mass , we can use the brightness distribution function of lpvs to construct the birth mass function and hence the star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of time . in this paper",
    "we present the results from application of this method to the local group des ngc147 and ngc185 .",
    "ngc147 and ngc185 were selected for the availability of suitable data of a significant number of lpvs ( lorenz et al .",
    "2011 ) , but also in their own right .",
    "both are satellites of andromeda ( m31 ) , the most massive member of the local group . ngc147 and ngc185 share fundamental properties such as luminosity ( @xmath5 ; crnojevi et al .",
    "2014 ) and velocity dispersion ( 25 km s@xmath6 ; geha et al .",
    "2010 ) , but they differ in many other aspects .",
    "ngc185 contains some gas , dust and shows evidence for recent star formation in its central regions , while ngc147 is destitute of gas and dust and shows no sign of recent star formation activity ( young & lo 1997 ; welch , sage & mitchell 1998 ; marleau , noriega - crespo & misselt 2010 ; de looze et al .",
    "the mean metallicity of ngc147 based on photometry of the red giant branch is [ m / h]@xmath7 to @xmath8 , which is slightly higher than that of ngc185 , [",

    "we have used the catalogue of lpvs from lorenz et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , they observed ngc147 and ngc185 with alfosc on the not , using the gunn @xmath23 band , on 38 nights between october 2003 and february 2006 .",

    "the lpvs were identified by means of the image subtraction technique .",
    "the resulting catalogue contains 213 lpvs in the direction of ngc147 and 513 lpvs in the direction of ngc185 .",
    "the loci of the lpvs are depicted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] with blue squares . as can be seen in figure [",
    "fig : fig1 ] , the central region of ngc 185 is denser towards the centre .",
    "hence , the identification of variable stars in the central regions is incomplete because of crowding .",
    "we have also made use of the catalogues of carbon stars published in sohn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and kang et al .",
    "they obtained near - infrared images with the canada ",
    "hawaii telescope in june 2004 , using the cfhtir imager and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 filters , each field covering @xmath33 .",
    "sohn et al .  ( 2006 ) present the photometry of 91 carbon stars in ngc147 , and kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present the photometry of 73 carbon stars in ngc185 .",
    "the loci of the carbon stars are depicted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] with red triangles .",
    "the @xmath28-band photometry is the best suited for calculating the sfr , because the spectral energy distributions of stars near the tip of the agb peak at near - infrared wavelengths , minimising uncertainties in bolometric corrections , and interstellar and circumstellar extinction is much less important than at optical wavelengths .",
    "because carbon stars can be used to trace ( part of ) the agb , we have cross matched the lpv and carbon star catalogues , using the average of @xmath28-band magnitudes for stars in common .",
    "we can thus examine the location of the agb stars in a colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , in comparison with isochrones from the stellar evolution models from the padova group ( marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) that we use later in our technique to derive the sfh .",

    "the optical cmds ( left panels of figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] ) clearly show the densely populated agb , from @xmath34 to @xmath35 mag . the smaller number of brighter / bluer stars are likely galactic foreground dwarfs .",
    "the carbon stars occupy the bright / red portion of the agb as these are in advanced stages of agb evolution ; likewise , the lpvs occupy the region where the agb terminates , thus validating our premise that lpvs can be used to determine the luminosity at the tip of the agb",
    ".    padova isochrones ( marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) are consistent with the photometry with the adopted distance moduli and metallicities of @xmath36 for ngc147 and @xmath37 for ngc185 .",
    "they include the effects of circumstellar dust formed in the winds from the most evolved agb stars , at @xmath38 mag .    our method , which is explained in section [ sec : sec3 ] , javadi et al.(2011 , 2016 ) and rezaeikh et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , is based on the luminosity peak of lpvs in the @xmath28 band .",
    "figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] show the location of the lpvs in the near - infrared cmds ( middle panels ) , as well as the carbon stars for comparison ( right panels ) .",
    "clearly , the vast majority of lpvs are several gyr old ( @xmath39 ) , with the youngest @xmath40500 myr old ( @xmath418.7 ) .",
    "the sfh of a galaxy is a measure of the rate at which gas mass was converted into stars over a time interval in the past . or in other words",
    ", it is the sfr , @xmath42 ( in m@xmath4 yr@xmath6 ) , as a function of time .",
    "the amount of stellar mass , @xmath43 , created during a time interval , @xmath44 , is : @xmath45 the number of formed stars are related to the total mass by the following equation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we use the imf defined in kroupa ( 2001 ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the normalization constant and @xmath50 is defined depending on the mass range : @xmath51 the minimum and maximum mass were assumed to be 0.02 and 200 m@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we need to relate this to the number of stars , @xmath52 , which are variable at the present time .",
    "if stars with mass between @xmath53 and @xmath54 are lpvs at the present time , then the number of lpvs created between times @xmath55 and @xmath56 is @xmath57 substituting equation [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] in equation [ eq : eq5 ] gives @xmath58    we are considering an age bin of @xmath44 , to determine @xmath59 .",
    "the number of lpvs observed in this age bin , @xmath60 , depends on the duration of the evolutionary stage during which the variability occurs : @xmath61    finally , by combining the above equations we obtain a relation to calculate the sfr based on lpv counts : @xmath62    to obtain the sfr we need to determine the individual stars masses , ages ( @xmath55 ) and durations of pulsation ( @xmath63 ) . for this",
    "we rely on theoretical models . the most appropriate theoretical models for our purpose are the padova models ( marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , for the following reasons : + @xmath64 they have prepared models for the required range in birth mass ( @xmath65 m@xmath4 ) by combining models for intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath66 m@xmath4 ) with those for more massive stars ( @xmath67 m@xmath4 ; bertelli et al .  1994 ) ) and corrections for low - mass , low - metallicity agb tracks ( girardi et al .",
    "2010 ) ; + @xmath64 they are based on computations carried out through the entire thermal pulsing agb until they enter the post - agb phase , in a manner that is consistent with the computation of the preceding evolutionary stages . the models account for the third dredge - up mixing of the stellar envelope as a result of the helium - burning pulses , and the increased luminosity of massive agb stars undergoing hot bottom burning ( iben & renzini 1983 ) ; + @xmath64 the models account for the molecular opacity in the cool atmospheres of red giants , including changes as a result of the transformation from oxygen - dominated m - type agb stars to carbon stars in the approximate birth - mass range of @xmath684 m@xmath4 ( girardi & marigo 2007 ) ; + @xmath64 they include predictions for dust production in the winds of lpvs and the associated attenuation and reddening of the synthetic photometry ; + @xmath64 they include predictions for the radial pulsation ; + @xmath64 they have been carefully transformed to various optical and infrared photometric systems ; + @xmath64 they are available via a user - friendly internet interface .",
    "+ one shortcoming is that these models do not account for the final part of the evolution of super - agb stars , i.e.  stars in the mass range @xmath691.3 .",
    "we note that the parsec+colibri models are the latest padova models and we use the padova models that incorporate the relevant physics already .",
    "however , according to marigo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the difference between the effective temperatures predicted by the two sets of models is negligible , and the same is true for the temperature at the base of the convective envelope . in the same paper they also show that their new models reproduce perfectly the core - mass luminosity relation adopted in the previous models , as well as confirming the predictions from alternative models ( from karakas et al .",
    "2002 ) . taken together",
    ", this means that the observational properties do not change markedly between these models , and that the relationship between empirical quantities and theoretical parameters remains essentially unchanged and robust .",
    "lpvs have reached the maximum luminosity on the agb . on that premise ,",

    "all the figures and tables related to ngc185 and to other metallicities used in this paper are presented in the appendix .",
    "there is an obvious excursion towards fainter @xmath28-band magnitudes for super - agb stars , because their evolution to brighter @xmath28-band magnitudes has been omitted from the models .",
    "we thus interpolate over that range in mass ( see javadi et al.2011 ) ; however , since we do not have any super - agb stars in any of these dwarfs , we effectively only use the part of the mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation that is modelled carefully .",
    "in other words , the brightest stars have @xmath71 mag so we are in the regime of stars for which the models give reliable predictions .",

    "the most striking variation in sfh that we see is in ngc185 , where recent star formation ( @xmath147 gyr or @xmath148 ) is very prominent in the inner 0.1 kpc but completely lacking beyond 0.5 kpc .",
    "this may be related to the strong central concentration we noted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "ngc147 exhibits a more uniform sfh , possibly related to the more diffuse distribution of agb stars in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .    as we mentioned at the end of section 3 , the dominant error on sfr",
    "is not photometric ; the photometric errors are very small as the measurements are well above the completeness limit of the surveys , but these are average values of variable stars and the typical uncertainty can be as much as 0.1 mag . however , as can be seen in figures 2 and 3 the spread in magnitude is very much larger ( a few magnitude ) and the error on the individual stars is negligible compared to the bins in age .",
    "this is confirmed by looking at the resulting sfhs , in figures 5 - 7 , some of which show variation between adjacent bins that is larger than the errorbars on those bins ; this could not have happened if the photometric uncertainties were large , especially as it is seen at some of the older bins which are associated with the fainter stars that would be expected to have larger photometric errors .",

    "the results we obtained in an entirely different way are remarkably consistent with theirs ; star formation sharply peaked @xmath151 gyr ago , but star formation lasted until @xmath159 myr ( @xmath160 ) @xmath161 pc from the centre of ngc185 .",
    "the only discrepancy is that our sfrs are about twice their values .",
    "like for ngc147 , davidge ( 2005 ) used near - ir photometry of agb stars ; he found that in ngc185 the most recent significant star formation occurred @xmath162 gyr ago , i.e.  much more recently than in ngc147 .",
    "we derived total stellar masses of @xmath163 m@xmath4 for ngc147 and @xmath164 m@xmath4 for ngc185 .",
    "the latter is in excellent agreement with the total stellar mass of @xmath165 m@xmath4 derived by davidge ( 2005 ) for ngc185 on the basis of near - ir photometry and assuming a mass - to - light ratio @xmath166 ; geha et al .",
    "( 2010 ) adopted somewhat larger @xmath167 values and hence obtained @xmath168 m@xmath4 for ngc147 and @xmath169 m@xmath4 for ngc185 , i.e.  34 times higher than our estimates .",
    "weisz et al .  ( 2014a ) obtained @xmath170 m@xmath4 for ngc147 and @xmath171 m@xmath4 for ngc185 , but these estimates do not include all of the galaxy and are therefore lower limits .",
    "their ngc147 field was roughly centred and covered @xmath172 of the half - light area , so we may expect the corrected total mass estimate to be a few times higher , i.e.  closer to @xmath173 m@xmath4 ; their ngc185 fields covered an area of similar size to the half - light area but off - centre by 200800 pc , so the corrected total mass estimate would again be higher by a factor of a few , i.e.  @xmath174 m@xmath4 . on balance , therefore , our estimates of the total stellar mass seem to agree with other , independent estimates , or perhaps be lower by a factor of a few at most .",
    "we may have missed some mass residing outside of the area covered by the monitoring data , or in the very oldest stars  which do not pulsate that strongly and which are therefore difficult to identify and account for  but not dramatically . moreover , since the variable star survey is incomplete due to crowding in the central field of ngc 185 , this may lead to star formation rates that are underestimated .",
    "figure [ fig : fig9 ] shows the cumulative sfh , i.e.  the build - up of stellar mass over cosmological time .",
    "it is clear that the peak of star formation occurred earlier in ngc185 than it did in ngc147 .",
    "it is also clear that the recent star formation in ngc185 is insignificant in terms of stellar mass .",
    "weisz et al .  ( 2014b ) argued that galaxies in which at least 70% of the stellar mass was in place by the time of cosmic reionization , could be considered ` fossil ' galaxies .",
    "according to that definition , ngc147 and ngc185 are not fossil galaxies , but have been actively evolving since cosmic reionization .",
    "weisz et al .  ( 2014b ) determined that 70% of the stellar mass was in place by @xmath175 for ngc147 and by @xmath176 for ngc185 .",
    "we find very similar timings : @xmath177 for ngc147 and @xmath178 for ngc185 .",
    "weisz et al .  ( 2015 ) then went on to quantify quenching of galaxy evolution , by the time by which 90% of the stellar mass is in place .",
    "according to this definition , the quenching of star formation occurred around @xmath179 in ngc147 and @xmath180 in ngc185 ; we find @xmath181 and @xmath180 , respectively , i.e.  sooner but similar in a relative sense .",
    "however , this neglects the recent star formation in ngc185 as it accounts for @xmath182% of the stellar mass . by their definition",
    ", even the milky way would be close to being quenched now .",
    "what does it mean if star formation is quenched ? what it does",
    "_ not _ mean , apparently , is that star formation is excluded from happening .",
    "martnez - delgado et al .  ( 1999 ) argued that the ism in des could be replenished by mass loss from dying earlier generations of stars , and retained and fuel further star formation , possibly in an episodic fashion .",
    "this would explain the recent star formation and presence of ism in ngc185 .",
    "the lack of ism in ngc147 , which is consistent with the absence of stars younger than 300 myr , could be due to external processes such as ram pressure due to the gaseous halo of m31 .",
    "indeed , ngc147 is tidally distorted and must therefore have spent some time recently in close proximity to m31 .",
    "geha et al .",
    "( 2015 ) suggest that the orbit of ngc185 has a larger pericenter as compared to ngc147 , allowing it to preserve radial gradients and maintain a small central reservoir of recycled gas .",
    "they interpret the differences in early - sfh to imply an earlier infall time into the m31 environment for ngc185 as compared to ngc147 .",
    "arias et al .",
    "( 2016 ) determined the likely orbits of ngc147 and ngc185 and used them to perform @xmath52-body simulations to follow their morphological evolution .",
    "they reproduced the tidal features seen in ngc147 ( but not in ngc185 ) ; their models suggest ngc147 and ngc185 ( and the cassii satellite ) have been a bound group for at least a gyr , and that their masses are @xmath183 m@xmath4 for ngc147 and @xmath184 m@xmath4 for ngc185 , similar to the aforementioned values .",
    "it may also be possible , however , that ngc185 became more centrally concentrated early on , preventing the removal of the ism from its centre , whereas a more diffuse ngc147 would have been more susceptible to tidal and ram pressure stripping even if it were on a similar orbit .",
    "we have applied the novel method of javadi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using long - period variable agb stars to derive the sfh in the m31 satellite dwarf elliptical galaxies ngc147 and ngc185 .",
    "our main findings are :    * star formation started earlier in ngc185 than in ngc147 , peaking around 8.3 gyr ago in ngc185 and 7 gyr ago in ngc147 .",
    "* star formation continued in ngc185 over the past 6 gyr , albeit at a much lower rate , until as recent as 200 myr ago in the centre , but it ceased much earlier in the outskirts ; in ngc147 , on the other hand , while star formation was significant between 36 gyr ago , no star formation is seen for the past 300 myr , and stars of all ages are more uniformly distributed . *",
    "the total stellar mass is @xmath185 m@xmath4 for ngc185 and @xmath186 m@xmath4 for ngc147 ; the true values are unlikely to be higher by more than a factor of a few .",
    "* of the total stellar mass , 70% ( 90% ) was in place by @xmath178 ( 9.56 ) in ngc185 and by @xmath177 ( 9.55 ) in ngc147 . * our conclusions",
    "were obtained completely independently , using different data and a different method , yet they are corroborated by previous work .",
    "* we thus confirm the possibility of a scenario in which ngc147 was accreted into the environs of m31 later than ngc185 , but that its current orbit takes it closer to m31 explaining its lack of ism , lack of recent star formation , and its tidal distortions as opposed to the ism and recent star formation in the centre of ngc185 . alternatively , ngc185 may have become more centrally concentrated early on , while ngc147 has not .",
