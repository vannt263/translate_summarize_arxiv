    "it is an interesting idea to assume an existence of the extra - dimensional space which eventually compactifies leaving our 4-dimensional space - time as a real world@xcite .",
    "the recent proposal@xcite for the mass scale of the compactified space to be much smaller than the planck scale gave a strong impact on the onset of studying phenomenological evidences of extra - dimensional effects . in recent approaches with extra dimensions",
    "it is usually assumed that the standard model particles reside in the 4-dimensional brane while the graviton may move around the bulk , the space - time with extra dimensions . in our present analysis",
    "we introduce bulk fermions in addition to the graviton and see what effects could be observed on the standard model particles .",
    "the bulk fermions interact with themselves as well as with fermions in the 4-dimensional brane through the exchange of the graviton and its kaluza - klein excited modes@xcite , or through the exchange of gauge bosons which may be assumed to exist in the bulk@xcite .",
    "the interactions among fermions generated as a result of the exchange of all the kaluza - klein excited modes of the graviton or gauge bosons may be expressed as effective four - fermion interactions@xcite . according to the four - fermion interactions we expect that the dynamical generation of fermion masses will take place .    in the present communication",
    "we look for a possibility of the dynamical fermion mass generation under the influence of the bulk fermions through the effective four - fermion interactions .",
    "although our argument is applicable to any higher dimensional models , we confine ourselves to the 5-dimensional space - time for the convenience of explanations . in 5 dimensions",
    "fermion mass terms are forbidden if we require the symmetry under the chiral projection .",
    "the possible source of fermion masses in 4 dimensions is two - fold , i. e. the dynamically generated fermion masses and masses of the kaluza - klein excited modes of the bulk fermions .",
    "the mass of the kaluza - klein excited modes is known to be of order @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the radius of the compactified fifth dimension .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : msi4dst ] that the mixing between the brane fermion and bulk fermion does not lead to the large mass of order @xmath0 for the fermion in 4 dimensions .",
    "we then consider in secs .",
    "[ sec : epfcf ] and [ sec : godfm ] whether the dynamically generated fermion mass can be made small compared with the mass of the kaluza - klein excited modes .",
    "we calculate an effective potential for a composite operator composed of a fermion and an anti - fermion in the leading order of the @xmath2 expansion with @xmath3 the number of fermion species .",
    "we find that the mass of fermions in the 4-dimensional brane is generated dynamically if the compactification radius @xmath1 passes its critical value @xmath4 and the phase transition associated with the mass generation is of second order .",
    "this means that the fermion masses in the 4-dimensional brane is small as far as the radius of the compactified fifth dimension is close to its critical value .",
    "we assume an existence of 5-dimensional bulk fermions @xmath5 in interaction with fermions @xmath6 on the 4-dimentional brane .",
    "effective interactions among these fermions can be given in the form of the four - fermion interaction .",
    "we imagine that such effective interactions originate from the exchange of the bulk gravitons between fermions .",
    "in fact it is known that the exchange of the kaluza - klein excited modes of the bulk graviton results in effective four - fermion interactions@xcite .",
    "after the fierz transformation on the four - fermion interactions we generate the transition - type interactions .",

    "thus , if we impose this symmetry on a lagrangian describing our fermion system , any fermion mass terms are forbidden thus resulting in the above lagrangian .",
    "it should be noted here that , as is easily understood by referring to the clifford algebra , an irreducible representation of the 5-dimensional fermion field is given by a 4-component field just as in the case of 4 dimensions .",
    "hence we can use the same field both for the 4 and 5 dimensions . in odd dimensions",
    "it is well - known that there exists no object like @xmath14 in 4 dimensions which commutes with all the @xmath15 matrices .",
    "hence we do not have such object in 5 dimensions while the fifth component of the @xmath15 matrices in 5 dimensions , @xmath16 , turns out to be @xmath17 in 4 dimensions .    for the later convenience we rewrite the above lagrangian by using auxiliary field @xmath18 in the following equivalent form , @xmath19\\ , \\delta(x^4 ) .",
