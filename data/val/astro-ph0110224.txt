    "in magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) , the flow of material lost by the secondary is channeled onto small spots on the white dwarf surface in the vicinity of the magnetic poles .",
    "because the infall velocity is supersonic , the flow passes through a strong shock above the stellar surface , where 15/16 of its prodigious kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy .",
    "the post - shock plasma is hydrostatically supported , and cools via cyclotron , thermal bremsstrahlung , and line emission before settling onto the white dwarf surface .",
    "consequently , the post - shock plasma of mcvs is both multi - temperature and multi - density , with a post - shock temperature @xmath5 kev and density @xmath6 for a mass - accretion rate @xmath7 ( hence @xmath8 ) , relative spot size @xmath9 , and free - fall velocity @xmath10 .",
    "if the shock height is a small fraction of the white dwarf radius , a significant fraction of the resulting emission is intercepted by the white dwarf surface .",
    "competition between photoelectric absorption and thompson and compton scattering results in @xmath11 kev x - rays being predominantly scattered by the white dwarf photosphere , resulting in a hard reflection spectral component , while softer and harder x - rays are increasingly likely to deposit their energy in the white dwarf photosphere , heating it to a temperature @xmath12 @xmath13  kk .",
    "@xmath14 must be larger by a factor of @xmath15 to explain the soft x - ray spectral component of am her - type mcvs .",
    "the _ unique _ aspect of the x - ray  emitting plasma in mcvs is the high densities , which are the result of the magnetic funneling of the mass lost by the secondary , the factor - of - four density jump across the accretion shock , and the settling nature of the post - shock flow , wherein the density @xmath16 .",
    "x - ray line intensity ratios have long been used to diagnose the temperature and density of solar plasma , but until recently the effective area and spectral resolution of x - ray observatories have been inadequate to allow similar studies of cosmic x - ray sources .",
    "the multi - temperature nature of the plasma in cvs is readily apparent from the broad - band nature of their x - ray continua , but even with the 0.510 kev bandpass and @xmath17 ev spectral resolution of the _ asca _ sis detectors , it is possible to adequately describe the observed spectra of cvs with a small number ( typically 2 ) of discrete temperature components .",
    "ishida , mukai , & osborne ( 1994 ) and subsequently fujimoto & ishida ( 1997 ) first applied the ratio of the intensities of the h- to he - like lines of mg , si , s , ar , and fe in the _ asca _ sis spectrum of the intermediate polar - type mcv ex  hya to constrain the range of temperatures present in its accretion column .",
    "unfortunately , _ asca _",
    "did not have the spectral resolution necessary to utilize any of the _ density _ diagnostics available in the x - ray bandpass , such as the density - sensitive he - like triplets , which require @xmath18 ev . with the launch of the _ chandra _ and",
    "_ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories , it is now possible to utilize a broad range of spectral diagnostics to characterize the plasma of mcvs .",
    "motivated by the beautiful _ asca _ spectrum , we recently obtained _ chandra _ hetgs ( @xmath19 and 0.02   ) and _ xmm - newton _ rgs ( @xmath20   ) and epic spectra of ex  hya .",
    "the 60 ks _",
    "observation was performed on 2000 may 18 during a multiwavelength ( _ rxte _ , _ chandra _ , _ euve _ , _ fuse _ , _ hst _ , and ground - based optical ) campaign , while the _ xmm - newton _ observation ( 100 ks ) was performed on 2000 july 12 .",
    "because of space limitations , we discuss here only the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum , which is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the spectrum consists of a modest continuum with superposed lines of h- and he - like o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe ; fe xvii  xxiv ; and `` neutral '' fe ( via the weak fluorescent line at 6.4 kev = 1.94   ) . whereas the optical  fuv emission lines of ex  hya are _ broad _ , with @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 ( hellier et al .  1987 ;",
    "greeley et al .",
    "1997 ; mauche 1999 ) , the x - ray emission lines are _ narrow _ , with @xmath24 .",
    "this is explained qualitatively by the fact that ( 1 ) the post - shock velocity @xmath25 and ( 2 ) we view the ex hya binary nearly edge - on , so the velocity vector of the post - shock flow lies more nearly on the plane of the sky .",
    "as was done with the _ asca _ spectra , we can use the ratio of the h- to he - like line intensities in the hetg spectrum of ex  hya to constrain the temperature distribution in the post - shock plasma .",
    "this was accomplished by fitting gaussians to the various emission lines , accounting for the effective area and resolution function of the spectrometer .",
    "results of these fits are shown in figure  2 for o , ne , mg , si , and s. in addition to easily resolving the h- and he - like emission lines , the hetgs cleanly resolves the resonance ( @xmath26 ) , intercombination ( @xmath27 ) , and forbidden ( @xmath28 ) lines of the he - like triplets , as well as accounts for the presence of other emission lines , such as the relatively strong fe  xix emission line situated between the resonance and intercombination lines of ne  ix ( these three lines appear as a blob in the _ xmm _ rgs spectrum ) . assuming the mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord ( 1985 ) collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) ionization balance and line intensities , figure  3 shows that the measured h- to he - like line intensity ratios require that the plasma temperature extends from @xmath29 kev to @xmath30 kev .",
    "this is the same range inferred by fujimoto & ishida ( 1997 ) from the _ asca _ spectrum of ex  hya , even though the sis could not resolve the h- and he - like emission lines of o and ne .",
    "the lower temperature limit is a bit of a puzzle , because it seems inescapable that the plasma will cool below this temperature .",
    "a possible explanation is that the optical depths in the lines begins to be important at this temperature , where the plasma density is expected to be a factor of @xmath31 times higher than the value just below the accretion shock .",
    "the standard density diagnostic of high - temperature plasmas is the ratio of the forbidden to intercombination lines of he - like ions ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ; blumenthal , drake , & tucker 1972 ; porquet et al .",
    "because the @xmath32 upper level of the forbidden line is metastable , it can be depopulated by collisional excitation , leading to the conversion of the @xmath33@xmath32 forbidden line @xmath28 into the @xmath33@xmath34 intercombination blend @xmath27 ( for the grotrian diagram , refer to the left panel of fig .",
    "we used the lxss plasma code being developed at llnl ( mauche , liedahl , & fournier 2001 ) to calculate the @xmath35 line ratios as a function of electron density for the abundant elements , and present the results in figure  5 .",
    "it can be seen that the critical density for this ratio scales with @xmath36 , ranging from @xmath37 for c to @xmath38 for fe .",
    "unfortunately , this trend is opposite to that in the accretion column of mcvs ( where the high-@xmath36 ions dominate at the top of the column where the temperature is highest and the density is lowest , and the low-@xmath36 ions dominate at the bottom of the column where the temperature is lowest and the density is highest ) , limiting our ability to `` map '' the density structure of the column . as is evident from figure  2 , all the he - like triplets of ex  hya are in the `` high - density limit '' ( @xmath39 ) , implying that the plasma density @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , this result is not entirely secure . in uv - bright sources like early - type stars , x - ray binaries , and cvs , photoexcitation as well as collisional",
    "excitation acts to depopulate the upper level of the he - like forbidden lines .",
    "if the radiation field is sufficiently strong at the appropriate wavelengths , the @xmath0 line ratio can be in the `` high - density limit '' regardless of the density .",
    "photoexcitation has been shown to explain the low @xmath0 line ratios of early - type stars ( kahn et al .",
    "2001 ; waldron & cassinelli 2001 ) , and could explain the low @xmath0 line ratios of ex  hya . to investigate this effect ,",
    "we included in the lxss level - population kinetics calculation the photoexcitation rates @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the continuum spectral energy distribution and @xmath43 are the oscillator strengths of the various transitions . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath44 ( i.e. , the radiation field is that of a blackbody of temperature @xmath45 ) and that the dilution factor of the radiation field is equal to @xmath46 ( i.e. , the x - ray  emitting plasma is in close proximity to the source of the photoexcitation continuum ) . for @xmath47  kk",
    ", we obtain the @xmath0 line ratios shown by the full curves in the right panel of figure  5 , which demonstrates that , for the given assumptions , all of the he - like @xmath0 line ratios through si  xiii are significantly affected by photoexcitation .",
    "it is unfortunate that this effect begins to disappear at s  xv , where the hetgs effective area is low and the spectral resolution is only just sufficient to resolve the he - like triplet .",
    "calorimeter - type detectors like those planned for _ astro - e2 _ and _ constellation - x _ are required to work at these short wavelengths / high energies .",
    "other than the h- and he - like lines of the abundant elements , the brightest emission lines in the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya are the @xmath48@xmath49 ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) lines of fe  xvii at 1517  (fig .  1 ) .",
    "these lines are strong in the x - ray spectra of high - temperature cie plasmas because of the high abundance of fe , the persistence of ne - like fe over a broad temperature range ( @xmath5212 mk ) , and the large collision strengths for @xmath53 transitions .",
    "the importance of fe  xvii has engendered numerous studies of its atomic structure and level - population kinetics , and while emphasis is usually placed on the _ temperature _ dependence of the @xmath54@xmath55 line ratios ( e.g. , rugge & mckenzie 1985 ; smith et al .",
    "1985 ; raymond & smith 1986 ) , mauche , liedahl , & fournier ( 2001 ) recently discussed the _ density _ dependence of these ratios .",
    "the grotrian diagram for fe  xvii is shown in the right panel of figure  4 . like the @xmath32 upper level of the forbidden line of he - like ions , the @xmath56 upper level of the 17.10    line of fe  xvii is metastable , so collisional depopulation sets in at lower densities , and the intensity ratio of the 17.10    line to any of the other @xmath54@xmath55 lines ( say , the 17.05    line ) provides a diagnostic of the plasma density .",
    "the fe  xvii @xmath57 density diagnostic is ideal for mcvs for two reasons .",
    "first , the critical density is high : @xmath58 , comparable to that of si  xiii .",
    "second , the @xmath57 line ratio is less sensitive than the he - like @xmath0 line ratios to photoexcitation . in fe",
    "xvii , photoexcitations out of the @xmath56 level go primarily into the @xmath59 manifold , requiring a significant flux of photons in the 190410    waveband . in he - like ions ,",
    "photoexcitations out of the @xmath32 level go primarily into the @xmath34 levels , requiring a significant flux of photons at @xmath60 , 1263 , 1036 , 865 , 743 , 637 , 551 , and 404    for o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe , respectively . because the photoexcitation continuum is typically stronger in the uv ",
    "fuv than in the euv , the fe  xvii @xmath57 line ratio is less sensitive to photoexcitation .    to investigate the density , temperature , and photoexcitation sensitivity of the fe  xvii @xmath61 line ratio , we calculated lxss atomic models of fe  xvii for a range of densities @xmath62@xmath63 , temperatures @xmath648  mk ( spanning the range for which the fe  xvii ionization fraction is @xmath65 ) , and blackbody photoexcitation temperatures @xmath6660  kk .",
    "the @xmath67 line ratio for @xmath68  mk , the peak of the fe  xvii ionization fraction , is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the measured fe  xvii @xmath61 line ratio of @xmath69 can be explained if the plasma density @xmath70 or if the photoexcitation temperature @xmath71  kk . as detailed by mauche , liedahl , & fournier ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the second option is consistent with the assumptions ( blackbody emitter , dilution factor equal to @xmath46 ) and the observed fuv flux density only if the fractional emitting area of the accretion spot @xmath72 .",
    "this constraint and the observed x - ray flux requires a density @xmath73 for the post - shock flow . either way",
    ", then , the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya requires that the plasma density in this mcv is orders of magnitude greater than that observed in the sun or other late - type stars .",
    "using the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya as an example , we have discussed some of the plasma diagnostics available in high - resolution x - ray spectra of mcvs .",
    "specifically , we have discussed the temperature dependence of the h- to he - like line intensity ratios and the density and photoexcitation dependence of the he - like @xmath0 line ratios and the fe  xvii @xmath1 line ratio .",
    "since the discussion assumes that the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium and that the optical depths in the lines are negligible , it does _ not _ apply to ( 1 ) the pre - shock flow , where photoionization competes with collisional ionization to determine the physical state of the plasma , ( 2 ) the immediate post - shock flow , where the ions and electrons are not in thermal equilibrium , or ( 3 ) the very base of the post - shock flow , where the line optical depths are non - negligible .",
    "where the plasma is optically thin and in collisional ionization equilibrium , the plasma temperature spans the range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 kev and the plasma density @xmath73 .",
    "the lower temperature probably signals where the plasma becomes optically thick in the lines , while the higher temperature is comparable to the shock temperature , which fujimoto & ishida ( 1997 ) inferred from the _ asca _ sis spectrum of ex  hya is @xmath74 kev .",
    "this communication has only scratched the surface of the many plasma diagnostics available in high - resolution x - ray spectra of mcvs . for lack of space ,",
    "our discussion has concentrated on density diagnostics and the complicating affects of photoexcitation because these features are unique to mcvs . for a more general discussion of the physics of high - temperatures plasmas ,",
