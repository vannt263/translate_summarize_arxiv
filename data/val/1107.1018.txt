    "it is our experience that isolated thermodynamic systems would eventually relax to a stationary state called equilibrium@xcite . in thermodynamics ,",
    "this statement is regarded as requirements for the relevant choice of the model and its macroscopic descriptions .",
    "recently , it is shown that equilibrium states are very popular in the extremely large hilbert space of state vectors for macroscopic quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the expectation values with respect to a randomly sampled pure state are typically well described by equilibrium ensembles@xcite . and",
    "it is expected that initial nonequilibrium state approaches to typical state of equilibrium .",
    "then it is reasonable to explore a dynamical explanation for the macroscopically observed behavior of the relaxation to equilibrium@xcite . indeed",
    "the coarsgrained macroscopic quantities typically yield a decomposition of the total hilbert space with a subspace of overwhelming dimension which represents equilibrium@xcite .",
    "based on this property , arbitrary state approaches and stays near equilibrium@xcite , which is a modern version of quantum ergodic theorem@xcite . by assuming the thermodynamically normal fluctuation of the quantities , the approach to equilibrium can be derived@xcite .",
    "also the reduced density matrix of huge isolated system approaches to time averaged state and stays near equilibrium for almost all the time@xcite .",
    "description of the relaxation is also important in the context of nonequilibrium theorems@xcite , which relies on the use of thermodynamic ensembles . as for the isolated system",
    ", the relaxation is not guaranteed for the total density matrix itself .",
    "indeed the total density matrix does not actually relax to a thermal state in the course of unitary time evolution .",
    "linear phonons in the initial microcanonical state which are externally perturbed and excites only few modes will not approach to a microcanonical state . for classical systems , there exist integrable systems which do not reach an equilibrium state even after a long waiting time due to the conserved quantities . for isolated quantum systems , there are always conservative quantities such as projection operators on a specific energy eigenstates@xcite . and it has been investigated which conservative quantities would affect the thermalization property@xcite .",
    "the thermalization of a few body quantities has been established for some nonintegrable systems whose energy spectrum do not tend to degenerate@xcite .",
    "there are also reports that the reduced equilibrium ensemble average works for spin chains both for integrable and nonintegrable parameters@xcite , which is consistent with the typicality of thermal state@xcite but in marked contrast to @xcite at least for the small system sizes .",
    "it is possible that there are formulations of relaxation properties which are not very sensitive to the nonintegrability .",
    "since we assume the initial microcanonical state , thermalization for the expectation values of the conservative quantities is trivial for autonomous systems as explained later on .",
    "also the evaluation of off - diagonal elements for the nonintegrable case shows quantitatively good agreement with the numerical values , which is a sufficient condition to guarantee the relaxation property .",
    "we insist that from the uniformly random sampling assumption which holds for nonintegrable cases and the initial equilibrium state , the expectation values of quantities which polynomially depend on the system size typically show relaxation to the equilibrium values .",
    "especially , it is pointed out that the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix does not contribute to the expectation values . in this article",
    ", we explain how the statement is made quantitative for the time - dependent unitary time evolution . and",
    "the explanation is numerically verified for a spin chain with a magnetic field in the nonintegrable regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present our model with the precise external forcing procedure . in sec.iii , the relaxation of the expectation values are explained .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to a summary .",
    "let us consider a macroscopically large but finite initially isolated system .",
    "after initial time @xmath0 , an external forcing acts on the system , and the total hamiltonian @xmath1 depends on time . until @xmath0 , the density matrix describing the initial state is assumed to be microcanonical specified by an energy @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of the states . in the course of time evolution ,",
    "the external work is done on the system through the time dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "the deterministic external forcing acts during the time interval @xmath5 , and switched off for @xmath6 .",
    "it is expected that after a sufficiently long waiting time , i.e. at @xmath7 , the density matrix reaches a state which yields approximately the same expectation values as the microcanonical ensemble @xmath8 with an energy shift @xmath9 .",
    "it is our statement that under the uniformly random sampling assumption valid for the nonintegrable cases , the microcanonical ensemble well approximates actual expectation value of quantity @xmath10 whose maximum eigenvalue polynomially depends on the system size @xmath11 this evaluation shows that the relaxation to equilibrium is explained as the property of the expectation values instead of the density matrix .",
    "note that the initial microcanonical state guarantees that eq.([unitary ] ) holds for the conservative quantities with @xmath12 for autonomous systems irrespective of the integrability .",
    "an important class of observables is extensive quantities which are sums of local quantities such as total magnetization in a spin chain .",
    "such quantities mutually almost commute , since the local quantities at spatially different points commute .",
    "the actual final state is reached by a unitary time evolution @xmath13 where we presented the eigenstate of @xmath14 as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "after @xmath18 , the total system is isolated , and evolves by the hamiltonian @xmath14 . on the other hand , for the nonintegrable systems the off - diagonal elements of the physical quantity @xmath10 is negligible compared to the diagonal elements :    * the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath19 of the nonintegrable system is typically negligible in the macroscopic limit .",
    "physically , this would be reasonable since it means that transition amplitudes between macroscopically different states due to the perturbation @xmath10 are extremely small@xcite .",
    "we shall give a quantitative explanation of this statement .",
    "the analysis is based on the high - dimensionality of the hilbert space as in refs.@xcite .",
    "let us diagonalize the quantity @xmath10 as @xmath20 and define its square root @xmath21 here the spectrum @xmath22 is assumed to be nonnegative . without loss of generality , the operators bounded below such as energy and number of particles can be made into this form .",
    "we also define state vectors @xmath23 so that the matrix element is expressed as the inner product @xmath24 the states @xmath25 are chosen from the extremely large hilbert space @xmath26 with various directions .",
    "thus we assume that the sequence of the normalized vectors @xmath27 is regarded as a _ uniformly random sampling _ from @xmath28 dimensional unit sphere as we will confirm for the case of nonintegrable spin chain .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the mean square of the inner product is smaller than @xmath29@xcite , which we will show later . here",
    "@xmath30 is the maximum of the eigenvalues of @xmath10 .",
    "+ let us derive the inequality for the inner product @xmath31 where the bracket shows the average with respect to the uniform random sampling of @xmath32 from the unit sphere .",
    "uniform random sampling is expressed by the vector representation of @xmath32 in an orthogonal complete basis as @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "hereafter we use the abbreviated notation for the dimension @xmath35 .",
    "the angles @xmath36 are uniform random variables on the real axes .",
    "we are interested in particular cases where @xmath30 polynomially depends on the system size . on the other hand",
    ", the dimension @xmath37 grows exponentially as the system size increases",
    ". then inequality ( [ inner ] ) shows that the off - diagonal elements eq.([offdiagonal ] ) is extremely small for the macroscopic system .",
    "we numerically show that eq.([inner ] ) actually holds and hence random sampling assumption is reasonable for a quantum spin chain .",
    "the spin chain is regarded as a nice example , since it provides observables , which is a sum of the local quantities .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin chain is chosen as @xmath38 where @xmath39 stands for the exchange interaction between neighboring sites , and a constant magnetic field @xmath40 is applied .",
    "@xmath41 is the @xmath42 component of the pauli matrix at the site @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 controles the nonintegrability . as a macroscopic quantity",
    ", we consider the square of the @xmath45 component of the total magnetization @xmath46 other choices of @xmath10 are possible , but eq.([quantity ] ) guarantees a well - defined square root @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath10 as @xmath45 component of the total magnetization or @xmath48 @xmath49 , we still observe behavior resembles to fig.1 .",
    "+ the system sizes @xmath50 are explored .",
    "note that the dimension of the total hilbert space is @xmath51 and can be large for relatively small @xmath52 . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix @xmath53 under the periodic boundary condition ,",
    "numerical eigenvectors @xmath54 are obtained , and the absolute values of all the matrix elements @xmath55 are shown in fig.1 . the data are shown only for parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , however , we have confirmed similar behavior for various values of @xmath59 . to verify that eqs.([inner],[product ] ) are satisfied quantitatively , we also show the matrix elements @xmath60 with a fixed value of @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the statistical mean value of the off - diagonal elements agrees with the theoretical estimation @xmath63 as shown in fig.2 .",
    "+ this estimation is considered as a generic property of macroscopically different states for the nonintegrable systems , since it is expressed only by the typical value of @xmath10 and the dimension @xmath35 .",
    "thus for large @xmath64 , the directions of @xmath65 are orthogonal to each other , and are considered to be distributed on the @xmath66 dimensional unit sphere without any bias to a specific direction .",
    "@xmath67 is immediately derived , since the expectation values of each component are the same and their sum should be unity . since @xmath54 and @xmath68 are normalized , @xmath69 the inequality ( [ inner ] ) derives from eqs.([product],[normalization ] ) . for comparison , the matrix elements @xmath60 at @xmath62 for the integrable case @xmath70",
    "are shown in fig.3 .",
    "as in fig.2 , @xmath71 is explored . for @xmath49 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 behaves as in the nonintegrable cases .",
    "but for @xmath74 , the smallness of the off - diagonal elements is affected . aside from the dominant contribution from the diagonal element ,",
    "there are subdominant contributions as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the same tendency takes place also for @xmath49 .",
    "this shows that the uniformly random sampling assumption is affected at least for the relatively small system size .",
    "+ from eq.([inner ] ) , the coefficient @xmath75 of eq.([evolution ] ) is safely replaced by @xmath76 in the evaluation of @xmath77.the off - diagonal elements of @xmath78 does not contribute to the expectation value of the quantity @xmath10 , since @xmath55 @xmath79 is neglected .. more quantitatively , the error caused by neglect of the off - diagonal elements is indeed negligible by random phase approximation , since there are @xmath80 terms of @xmath81 with various phases . *",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath78 is well - approximated by those of a microcanonical state with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that the initial microcanonical state specifies an energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "indeed the diagonal elements are expressed as @xmath82 where we introduced the normalized eigenstates of @xmath83 as @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 with an eigenstate of @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the set of states @xmath88 and @xmath89 are related by a unitary transformation @xmath90 . in the presence of perturbation , @xmath91 would be non negligible only when the conservation of the energy is well - satisfied after the long waiting time , i.e. @xmath92 with the energy change @xmath9 from the initial to final times caused by external perturbation during @xmath93 .",
    "+ we show a quantitative estimation of @xmath9 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath94 is evaluated as @xmath95 up to the first order of the perturbation @xmath96 , where the factor @xmath97 would be of order @xmath98 as in eq.([inner ] ) .",
    "then it is immediately shown that @xmath99 contributes to @xmath94 only when @xmath99 and @xmath100 are sufficiently near @xmath101 , otherwise the ratio @xmath102 is negligible .",
    "such @xmath103 is expanded as @xmath104 , where the coefficient @xmath105 is non negligible for @xmath100 sufficiently near @xmath99 .",
    "the energy change @xmath9 is determined as @xmath106 which is almost independent of the suffix @xmath107 .",
    "here we evaluated as @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the dirac delta in eq.([element ] ) .",
    "the important property used here is a continuity of the mapping , i.e. when @xmath110 is small enough compared to @xmath111 , @xmath112 is also sufficiently small .",
    "+ therefore the third line of eq.([element ] ) has a sharp peak at @xmath113 as a function of @xmath114 and is proportional to the function @xmath115 as @xmath116 where the density of the states at @xmath117 is determined uniquely from the normalization , and @xmath15 is used .",
    "the diagonal elements is thus given by the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "then as far as the expectation value is concerned , the state @xmath78 should be well - described by the microcanonical ensemble @xmath118 .",
    "in conclusion , by assuming that the initial state is prepared as a microcanonical ensemble and the uniformly random sampling assumption holds as in the nonintegrable systems , the actual state at time @xmath117 can be replaced by another microcanonical ensemble in the evaluation of quantities which polynomially depend on the system size .",
    "the derivation is based on the high dimensionality of the hilbert space and consequent uniformly random sampling assumption valid for the nonintegrable systems , and restrictions for the system size dependence of observables as well as the perturbative treatment of unitary transformation of the energy eigenstates .",
    "the validity of the uniformly random sampling assumption for @xmath32 is numerically verified for a nonintegrable spin chain .",
    "it is also remarked that the initial state can be out of equilibrium , i.e. the initial density matrix is @xmath119 with a unitary transformation @xmath120 , since this can be regarded as the state evolved from an actual initial state @xmath121 .",
