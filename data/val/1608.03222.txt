    "the motion of a particle under the influence of a central force is a standard topic of classical mechanics and is treated extensively in almost all text books on the subject .",
    "the radial nature of the force implies the conservation of angular momentum and greatly simplifies the analysis of the radial equation , with the orbit being determined by binet s formula .",
    "however , in most cases the possibility of the central forces being of anisotropic character is usually not treated .",
    "newtonian forces depending on position and having a nonvanishing curl are usually termed as curl forces . in @xciteit",
    "was shown that for a plananr isotropic force , @xmath0 when @xmath1 , with a nonvanishing curl one can quite generally map the radial equation to the emden - fowler equation by defining a transformation of both the independent and dependent variables .",
    "incidentally the issue of such forces did not escape whittaker s @xcite attention . in his book the problem of the most general field of force under which a given curve can be described",
    "is treated .",
    "starting with a curve @xmath2 the general form of the component of the acceleration @xmath3 are derived .",
    "this expression involves an arbitrary function @xmath4 of @xmath5 , which is related to the square of the velocity of particle . in general",
    "the curl condition is @xmath6 .",
    "of course there is no mention of the possibility of deriving hamiltonians in this context . in recent times a fairly general treatment of the ermakov @xcite and generalised ermakov system @xcite",
    "was also performed which treatment involved forces depending upon both @xmath7 and @xmath8 with a nonvanishing curl .",
    "these analyses were motivated mainly by a desire to examine if the equation was linearisable .",
    "berry and shukla @xcite showed that the force on a particle with complex electric polarizability is known to be not derivable from a potential , i.e. , its curl is nonzero . in general curl forces",
    "are newtonian but not hamiltonian or lagrangian .",
    "however , recently the hamiltonian formalism of curl forces has been studied in @xcite .    in @xcite the authors performed a detailed analysis of the nature of the motion for specific values of the exponent @xmath9 of the force .",
    "in particular their analysis of the case @xmath10 is interesting and begs the question of the possible implications of such a motion evoking as it does an uncanny similarity with the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "furthermore in course of their analysis they determined two first integrals of motion corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the emden - fowler ( ef ) equation which forms the cornerstone of their work is a well - known nonlinear ordinary differential equation and has been extensively studied by leach _",
    "et al _ @xcite from the point of view of its symmetries .",
    "consequently one of the objectives of the present article is to show that these first integrals are actually the fruits of the existence of a variational ( noetherian ) symmetry of the emden - fowler equation .",
    "consider a lagrangian system @xmath13 , on a configuration space @xmath14 with local coordinates @xmath15 .",
    "the action of an one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms @xmath16 on @xmath17 with the induced vector field reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 the group @xmath16 is a noetherian symmetry of the lagrangian system if it preserves the action functional @xmath20 , if @xmath21    the noether theorem states that if @xmath16 is a noether symmetry then @xmath22    there are several possible ways to generalise the berry - shukla construction . in this paper",
    "we briefly outline the curl force in the presence of a coordinate - dependent dissipative force and show that the system can be mapped to the lane - emden equation , which appears in the study of stellar structure .",
    "polytropes are a family of equations of state for which the pressure @xmath23 is given as a power of density @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants .",
    "the lane - emden equation @xmath28 combines this @xmath23 and @xmath24 relation and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this was originally proposed by jonathan lane @xcite and was analysed by emden @xcite .",
    "the lane - emden equation can be solved analytically only for a few special , integer values of the index @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite and for all other values of @xmath31 we must resort to numerical solutions .",
    "several applications of the emden - fowler and lane - emden equations of various forms arising in astrophysics @xcite and nonlinear dynamics have been reported .",
    "the reader is also referred to the now oldish paper by wang @xcite for a sampling of citations of papers dealing with the equation using various approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce nonisotropic curl forces and briefly recollect the results of athorne @xcite and haas and goedert @xcite . in section 3",
    "we show that from the particular solution of the ef equation it is possible to arrive at the results of @xcite .",
    "finally by introducing the lagrangian of the emden - fowler equation and taking into consideration its symmetries one can easily derive the first integrals stated in berry s and shukla s paper .",
    "the motion of a point particle in the plane , taken for convenience to be of unit mass , is best studied in terms of polar coordinates , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in terms of which the components of the equation of motion are @xmath32 in plane polar coordinates the condition @xmath33 translates into the requirement that @xmath34 for the generalised ermakov system of @xcite the radial and transverse components of the force are given by @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are arbitrary functions and one may verify that the force satisfies ( [ e3 ] ) and is therefore a curl force . for the generalised ermakov system there exists the well - known lewis - ray - reid ( lrr ) invariant @xmath38    in this connection mention has to be made of the method used by gorringe and",
    "leach @xcite to deduce a first integral for a planar system governed by a noncentral force the radial and tangential components of which are given by @xmath39,\\;\\ ; f_\\theta(r,\\theta)=-\\frac{v(\\theta)}{r^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are arbitrary functions .",
    "note that for such a force @xmath33 if and only if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not sinusoidal functions of their arguments .    in @xcite a class of dynamical systems",
    "was considered which included the autonomous ermakov system and the anisotropic keplerian central force systems and it was shown that they were linearisable up to a pair of quadratures . in both @xcite and @xcite the possibility of linearisation rested upon the existence of the lrr invariant which was exploited for this purpose .",
    "the central feature of the demonstration consisted in the transformation of the radial coordinate @xmath7 by invoking an inverse transformation of the form @xmath40 and in using the lrr invariant to replace the time derivative with the derivative with respect to the angular coordinate , @xmath8 , via the relation @xmath41 obtained from ( [ e6 ] ) with @xmath42 .",
    "for the generalised ermakov system hass and goedert then showed that the resulting form of the radial equation is @xmath43 finally to achieve linearisation they demanded that the right - hand - side be of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are arbitrary functions of their respective arguments .",
    "this condition imposes the necessary restrictions upon the frequency @xmath48 .",
    "if one sets @xmath49 , then of course ( [ e7 ] ) automatically becomes linear . to illustrate the above procedure we consider an example .",
    "@xmath50    @xmath51    the force @xmath52 is single - valued and periodic in the angular coordinate and is in the transverse direction .",
    "it is clear that @xmath53 and is nonvanishing provided @xmath54 .",
    "comparison with ( [ e5 ] ) shows that @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the lrr invariant yields @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . under the transformation @xmath59",
    "we find that ( [ e7 ] ) reduces to @xmath60 some numerical solutions of the latter equation and for @xmath61 are given in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is now straightforward to deduce the basis of solutions . while for @xmath62 in [ fig3 ] . *",
    "remark : * the lrr invariant is marked by an absence of any dependence upon the radial velocity and the procedure described above relies upon this as it enables one to solve for @xmath63 in terms of @xmath64 only .    ) for different values of the constant of motion i greater than one .",
    "solid line is for @xmath65 , dash - dash line is for @xmath66 , while dash - dot line is for @xmath67 .",

    "it is necessary to substitute the value of the lewis - ray - reid invariant .",
    "we provide two orbits , one for each option , which suggest that the latter is preferable even if geometrically less satisfactory .",
    "following berry and shukla we assume @xmath80 @xmath81 in general it is assumed that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a constant and may be scaled to unity . clearly @xmath0 and",
    "the condition @xmath33 implies that @xmath84 which precludes the case @xmath85 , i.e. , the @xmath86 case which was separately examined in detail in their work . in order to map the system ( [ e15])-([e16 ] ) to the emden - fowler equation they introduced the transformation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the angular momentum and is not an invariant and @xmath89 is the integrated torque defined by @xmath90 it follows from ( [ e16 ] ) that @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 consequently , differentiating with respect to @xmath93 and using ( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath94 thus , when @xmath1 , we have , on making use of ( [ e17 ] ) in ( [ e19 ] ) , @xmath95 where @xmath96 eqn . ( [ e21 ] ) is the well - known emden - fowler equation @xcite .",
    "the scaling transformations , @xmath97 enable us to remove the factor @xmath98 in the emden - fowler equation which now has the appearance @xmath99    extending the technique of integrable modulation we obtain @xcite the following proposition .",
    "the second - order ordinary differential equation @xmath100 admits a first integral of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "hence in our case @xmath104 implies @xmath105 .",
    "now it is known that ( [ e22a ] ) admits the particular solution @xmath106 where @xmath107^{1/m-1}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath108 corresponds to @xmath109 and it follows therefore that this case must be separately analysed .",
    "in fact it causes ( [ e22a ] ) to reduce to the linear equation @xmath110 and may also be analysed by the methods of section 2 since it corresponds to setting @xmath111 in([e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) which admits the first integral @xmath112 and leads to the linear equation @xmath113 consequently on the level surface , @xmath114 , if we set @xmath115 then the above equation becomes @xmath116 moreover from ( [ e24 ] ) we observe that , as @xmath104 , so , when @xmath117 , then @xmath118 and the solution is trivial .",
    "however , @xmath117 corresponds to @xmath86 and the force @xmath119 therefore requires special treatment .    from ( [ e17 ] ) after taking into account the scaling we have @xmath120,\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the initial position , which gives @xmath122 as a function of @xmath7 while ( [ e23 ] ) gives @xmath122 as a function of @xmath123 , the angular momentum . by combining these",
    "we obtain @xmath123 as a function of @xmath7 given by @xmath124^{\\frac{1-m}{n+2}}.\\ ] ]    the equation for the orbit can be obtained using the fact the ( [ e18 ] ) gives @xmath125 so that @xmath126 whence using ( [ e23 ] ) and ( [ e30 ] ) we obtain the final equation determining the orbit as @xmath127 the solutions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath93 follow from ( [ e16 ] ) which upon taking into consideration the scaling of @xmath128 becomes @xmath129 scaling of the time , @xmath130 , causes it to become @xmath131 so that @xmath132 using ( [ e30 ] ) to calculate @xmath133 we find that @xmath134 which explicitly determines @xmath135 and hence @xmath93 as a function of @xmath7 and serves in principle to determine @xmath136 .",
    "we then solve the equation for the orbit , which gives @xmath137 , and we may recover @xmath8 as a function of @xmath93 by replacing @xmath7 .",
    "the solvable case @xmath138 and the solutions for @xmath139 may now be easily recovered by appropriately choosing @xmath121 as either @xmath140 or zero and they verify the corresponding results stated in @xcite .",

    "as given above we find upon setting @xmath157 that the lagrangian yields the first integral @xmath158 which is identical to that derived by berry and shukla after reverting to the original variables .",
    "* case b ) * in a similar fashion with @xmath159 the corresponding emden - fowler equation is derivable from the lagrangian @xmath160 unlike the previous case we have only one symmetry generator which here is given by @xmath161 and gives rise to the first integral @xmath162 upon setting @xmath163 and reduces to the corresponding result stated in bs once we revert to the original polar variables .    it is worth to note that berry and shukla considered geometric symmetries of the force , not of the hamiltonian or lagrangian .",
    "the programme of analysis of curl forces initiated by berry and shukla can be extended to curl forces in the presence of a dissipative force .",
    "consider a particle moving under a force @xmath164 including velocity - dependent forces given by @xmath165the components of the equation of motion in terms of polar coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath79 are @xmath166when we use the angular momentum , @xmath167 , we can express the radial equation as @xmath168the integrated torque equation is given by @xmath169thus , when @xmath170 and @xmath171 , we have @xmath172where @xmath173    for @xmath174 case eqn ( [ e104 ] ) can be identified with one of the equation of kamke s list .",
    "equation ( [ e104 ] ) is a nonautonomous equation .",
    "however , it can be written as the following autonomous system @xcite@xmath175where @xmath176 is a new affine parameter and now @xmath177 and @xmath178 . the system ( [ e105 ] ) , ( [ e106 ] ) describes the free motion ( geodesic equations ) of a particle in a two - dimensional manifold with symmetric connection coefficients @xmath179hence for the determination of the point symmetries of the system ( [ e105 ] ) , ( [ e106 ] ) the results of @xcite can be applied .",
    "therefore we have that in general the system ( [ e105 ] ) , ( [ e106 ] ) admits the lie point symmetries @xmath180 .",
    "however , when  @xmath181 , i.e. @xmath182 there exists the extra lie point symmetry@xmath183    moreover @xmath184 is also the unique lie point symmetry of equation ( [ e104 ] ) .",
    "the zeroth- and the first - order invariants of @xmath184 are@xmath185    we select @xmath48 to be the new independent variable and @xmath186 to be the new dependent variable . therefore in the new variables ,",
    "@xmath187 , equation ( [ e104 ] ) is reduced to the following first - order equation@xmath188which is an abel s equation of the second type @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath189 , i.e. @xmath190 , @xmath191 , equation ( [ e104 ] ) admits eight lie point symmetries , which means that there exists a transformation @xmath192 and ( e104 ) becomes @xmath193 .",
    "on the other hand we introduce the variables @xmath194 , where the nonautonomous second - order equation ( [ e104 ] ) becomes the autonomous third - order equation @xmath195which admits always the symmetry vector @xmath196 .",
    "reduction with the latter symmetry vector leads to ( [ e104 ] ) .",
    "however for specific values of the constants @xmath197 , i.e. @xmath198 , equation ( [ e108 ] ) admits extra symmetry vectors .",
    "specifically we have that for arbitrary @xmath197 ,  the admitted lie symmetry is the @xmath199 . for @xmath174 , and @xmath200 equation ( [ e108 ] ) admits the lie symmetries @xmath196 ,  @xmath201 . for @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , equation ( e108 )",
    "admits the lie symmetries @xmath199 and @xmath204 , while for  @xmath205 we have that ( [ e108 ] ) is invariant under the two dimensional lie algebra@xmath206 in which @xmath207this vector field is related with vector field @xmath184 of above .",
    "again from ( [ e109 ] ) we can see that @xmath208 , is a solution of ( [ e108 ] ) if and only if @xmath209while when @xmath202 , a special solution is the exponential function @xmath210    the general analysis of equation ( [ e104 ] ) is of interests however that is overpass the purpose of this current work and will be published in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have carried forward the programme of analysis of curl forces initiated by berry and shukla .",
    "this is largely an unexplored area of nonlinear mechanics , though efforts at linearisation of planar systems subject to nonisotropic central forces were performed by athorne and haas and goedert in the context of kepler - ermakov theory .",
    "we have shown that the first integrals derived by berry and shukla are the noetherian first integrals resulting from the symmetries of the emden - fowler equation .",
