    "quantum monte carlo simulations are classical monte carlo simulations of quantum systems that have been represented in a way amenable to monte carlo simulations .",
    "such a quantum - to - classical mapping is necessary because the spectrum of a quantum system is a priori unknown .",

    "we will omit variational monte carlo and be very concise on diffusion monte carlo and auxiliary field monte carlo .",
    "this does not mean that these methods are unimportant or unsuccessful ( the latter was recently able to identify a spin liquid in the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice for example  @xcite ) , but this decision is only determined by space constraints . among the existing reviews on monte carlo methods we mention ref .",

    "they were weakly interacting and well described by bogoliubov s theory of the weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "there are two ways to make the system strongly interacting : one is to tune a magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance where the scattering length diverges ; the other is to load them into an optical lattice where the physics is dominated by tunneling as the atoms become more localized when ramping up the lattice laser  @xcite . following the proposal of jaksch _ et al . _",

    "@xcite has led to the paradigm of _ quantum simulation _ : an unsolvable model with competing interactions , believed to describe a real material and intractable by numerical means , can be implemented and realized in a cold gas experiment , and analyzed this way . by changing the interaction , dispersion , and density of the atoms the phase diagram of the model can be revealed .",
    "this allows to assess how well the model describes the material .",
    "an optical lattice system would thus be equivalent to an analog quantum computer , which is specifically tailored to one task ( i.e. , one particular model ) , but is more powerful than a classical computer in the sense that it can perform _ quantum _ operations ( since typical scales in those systems are of the order of khz , we do not claim that they are fast computers ) . before the quantum optical lattice simulator can be trusted as a reliable device",
    ", it needs to be benchmarked and validated against known results .",
    "this is where exact numerical methods , and in practice these are quite often monte carlo simulations , come in : because of the cleanliness and control over optical lattice systems , their complete hamiltonians can be simulated in cases where there is no sign problem , such as bosonic cold gases .",
    "excellent agreement has been reached between experiments and simulations this way  @xcite , after taking a number of technical details into account .",
    "this has sparked renewed interest in developing numerically exact solutions to models in parameter regimes that were hitherto of lesser importance ; for example , the three - dimensional hubbard model for temperatures approaching the nel temperature and interaction strengths up to @xmath6 times the bandwidth have now been fully and controllably mapped out  @xcite . for those , cluster dynamical mean - field theory simulations ( so - called dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) simulations to be precise ) were performed for cluster sizes of size @xmath7 , enabling a reliable extrapolation in cluster size while still having a manageable sign problem .",
    "now that optical lattice emulators have been validated and are gradually moving on to parameter regimes no longer tractable by traditional numerical means , will they be used as stand - alone machines ?",
    "in our view , the importance of numerical support for explanations of cold gas experiments will not diminish in the near future . instead , we believe that computational physicists ( for whom , ironically , _ quantum simulation _ is historically understood as simulating quantum systems on classical computers ) will develop a variety of new algorithms and convergence schemes tailored towards the problem of interest .",
    "the reward will be a direct test against those experiments , and the development of new algorithms that may be applicable in other fields .",
    "it is my hope that newcomers to the field will find this text useful as a starting point in understanding the different expansion schemes , their similarities and differences , and learn how such schemes can be turned into powerful stochastic algorithms .",
    "perhaps this text can lower the threshold to enter into this field .",
    "codes , full algorithmic descriptions or expressions for detailed balance can not be found in this review , but references are given .",
    "i also hope that this overview is useful for the researchers in the field of cold gases without numerical background , so that a single text can be used as an orientation platform that accurately describes the state of the art .",
    "i likewise hope that experts will find this text useful for bringing together at first sight totally different methods , but which may ultimately lead to new ideas and crosstalk among aficionados of different subfields , and extend the double paradigm of quantum simulation to new models and parameter regimes .",

    "the lattice spacing is set to unity . unless otherwise specified we have a cubic lattice in mind of linear size @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the bose - hubbard model has three phases , which can easily be identified in the limiting cases  @xcite : first , in the limit of high temperature , the system is a normal liquid . at zero temperature and @xmath20 ,",
    "the system is a mott insulator with fixed , integer density , a gap , and zero compressibility . for finite",
    "hopping , stable mott lobes around the @xmath20 insulators are found , which are surrounded by a gapless , compressible superfluid .",
    "the superfluid phase also exists at finite temperature .",

    "the inverse temperature @xmath25 is understood as an imaginary time , where the matrix elements of the operators @xmath26 $ ] act as propagators between the different states at @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath29 change the states at those times .",
    "a worldline then describes the trajectory of a particle propagating in imaginary time .",
    "the expansion in path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) is always understood over a finite volume and finite imaginary time .",
    "there is no singularity caused by a phase transition , which can only be studied in a finite size scaling analysis .",
    "the expansion is written in terms of an entire function so that there are no non - physical divergencies in the pimc formulation .",
    "the expectation value of an observable @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 .",
    "in pimc , a statistical interpretation is given to eq .",
    "[ eq : bh_expansion ] by introducing weights @xmath32 through @xmath33 .",
    "we now have to statistically generate all possible configurations according to their weights by generating all possible expansion orders and matrix elements , assign an ( unnormalized ) weight to each one of them , evaluate the observable @xmath30 in every configuration , and sum all these contributions .",
    "for instance , one can perform local updates by inserting pairs of hopping elements , in which a particle hops from a site to its neighbour , and back at a later time .    at high temperatures or deep in the mott insulating phase ,",
    "the kinetic energy is small compared to @xmath14 and/or @xmath34 , and few perturbation orders are needed in eq .",
    "[ eq : bh_expansion ] .",
    "such is not the case when the contributions to the free energy coming from the hopping are large : there is no reason to expect that the local updates would be efficient .",
    "even worse , they are not ergodic : the low energy states in a superfluid are given by states with a different winding number",
    ". these are paths in which a particle winds around the full length of at least one direction before closing on itself again .",
    "configurations with different winding numbers are topologically distinct and can not be transformed into each other by local updates alone .",
    "the winding number @xmath35 is directly related to the superfluid density through @xmath36  @xcite , with @xmath2 the dimension of the system . worldlines with non - zero winding number are caused by bosonic permutations .",
    "the worm algorithm has completely solved those ergodicity problems  @xcite . instead of working with the partition function @xmath37 alone one",
    "also works in the green function sector @xmath38 , @xmath39 graphically , the operators @xmath40 @xmath41 are open ends delimiting a segment of a worldline ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : worldlines ] ) and are called the worm head and the worm tail",
    ". the worms can be on any site and any time .",
    "a correct algorithm allows for the transition between the green function sector and the partition function sector ( where measurements of observables such as the energy and the superfluid stiffness are done ) , and allows to move the worms around in configuration space .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowa_insert ] . worms also have the ability to insert and remove hopping elements ( kinks ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowa_kink ] .",
    "since the worm operators correspond to open ends on a world line segment they have no problem in exploring configurations with different winding numbers .",
    "all updates are local in the green function sector , which means that all acceptance factors can be made of order unity . in phases with off - diagonal long - range order ( either true long - range order such as seen in a bose - einstein condensate or quasi long - range order with correlation functions decaying as a power - law ) the worms will preferentially be far away from each other in configuration space , _",
    "i.e. _ , we are efficient in describing the physics of those phases .    in the literature , different implementations of the above ideas can be found .",
    "the minimal requirements for the updates are however nothing more than the ones shown in the figs .",
    "[ fig : lowa_insert ] and  [ fig : lowa_kink ] , combined with a move update which moves the position of the worm head forward or backward in imaginary time without changing the kinks .",
    "we will therefore only briefly mention the key ideas and refer to the relevant papers .",
    "prokofev , svistunov and tupitsyn were the first to introduce the worm algorithm  @xcite .",
    "they formulated it for the bose - hubbard model in the grand - canonical ensemble in the path integral representation .",
    "sandvik and syljusen introduced worm operators for spin models in the stochastic series representation with directed loop updates  @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that the loop algorithm was the first algorithm formulated in continuous imaginary time ( _ i.e. , _ free of trotter discretization error ) to overcome the critical slowing down near the second order phase transition  @xcite , even before the worm algorithm was invented .",
    "et al . _ tried to combine the two algorithms and formulated the worm algorithm in the path integral representation but with directed loops  @xcite .",
    "_ formulated a worm algorithm in the canonical ensemble by letting the worm head and the worm tail propagate simultaneously in imaginary time , thereby creating and annihilating a particle on different sites simultaneously  @xcite .",

    "the transition from the normal liquid to the superfluid phase belongs to the 3d @xmath42-model  @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the superfluid phase undergoes a phase transition to the mott insulating phase .",
    "this transition belongs to the @xmath3 dimensional xy model ( and is hence of mean - field nature with logarithmic corrections ) : near the tip of the mott lobe , the particle and hole excitations have the same effective mass and become relativistic  @xcite .",
    "away from commensurability , the transition between the superfluid and the mott insulator belongs to the gaussian type universality class  @xcite .    in the mott insulator",
    ", the dispersion of the particle and hole excitations can be found by evaluating the green function at zero momentum in the large imaginary time limit .",
    "specifically , one finds , using the lehmann representation , that @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the quasiparticle weights and @xmath45 the energies of a single particle ( + ) and hole ( - ) excitation .",
    "this was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to indeed see the emerging relativistic effects near the tip of the mott lobe , but also to accurately determine the phase boundary of the mott lobe .",
    "the semi - analytic predictions can also be used to study inhomogeneous models in the local density approximation  @xcite .    the transition between the normal liquid and the superfluid can be studied by a finite size scaling analysis for the superfluid density  @xcite .",
    "( note : also the tip of the mott lobe , where the critical exponents take mean - field values @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is best found using a finite size scaling analysis of the superfluid density .",
    "no logarithmic corrections could be discerned in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) writing the distance to the critical point as @xmath48 , the superfluid density @xmath49 obeys the scaling equation @xmath50 with @xmath19 the system size , @xmath51 the correlation length , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 universal scaling functions .",
    "the first equality follows from the theory of critical phenomena ; in the second one we have used that the correlation length will be cut off by the system size close enough to the transition point and that @xmath54 , with @xmath55  @xcite for the universality class of the 3d xy model .",
    "hence , plotting @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 for different system sizes will display a crossing in a single point ( to leading order ) , which is the critical temperature .",
    "alternatively , data collapse can be obtained when plotting @xmath57 as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "although cold bosonic atoms subject to an optical lattice realize the bose - hubbard model , there are a few differences between experiments and the model discussed thus far .",
    "we list the most important ones :    * the confining potential to trap the neutral atoms is well described by a parabolic potential . for a potential @xmath59 with spherical symmetry ,",
    "the local chemical potential is changed to @xmath60 , with @xmath15 the global chemical potential .",
    "its influence on the phase diagram has been analyzed in great detail  @xcite . because of the inhomogeneous chemical potential , spatial coexistence of superfluids and mott insulating domains may occur .",
    "a sharp phase transition for a homogenous system is replaced by a gradual crossover in a trapped system . for shallow potentials , the local density approximation ( lda )",
    "is often used , where every site is treated as an independent system with its own chemical potential .",
    "it is a very good approximation when the correlation length in the system is small , i.e. , away from phase transitions  @xcite ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : singlesite ] ) .",
    "* the fact that atoms are neutral particles makes detection much more difficult than in typical condensed matter systems .",
    "the most frequent detection tool is time - of - flight interference images , where the confining potential is switched off and the atoms expand ballistically , after which a laser shines on them and makes a picture on a camera . in the long - time limit",
    "the measured atomic interference pattern reflects the momentum distribution of the initial system .",
    "however , for typical expansion times of @xmath61ms , there remains a fresnel diffraction term which is not negligible  @xcite , while interactions during the expansion can be neglected provided the atoms are well localized in the lattice and the density is low .",
    "this fresnel diffraction term acts like a knife cutting off long - range correlations ; typically correlations beyond 5 - 6 lattice spacings average out due to the fast oscillating phases . in particular , the @xmath62 condensate peak in an interference pattern is seriously affected ( and can not be used to infer the condensate fraction at all ) .",
    "the fresnel term can fortunately be taken into account in monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "for the weakly interacting bose gas on the other hand _ interactions _ during the expansion can not be neglected  @xcite . *",
    "a major difference with condensed matter physics is that trapped cold gases are well described by an isolated system ( recall for example the absence of a phonon bath ) . despite the very low absolute temperatures , the involved scales are _ not _ orders of magnitude smaller than the bosonic condensation temperature ( or the fermi energy for fermionic systems ) . as a consequence",
    ", entropy is conserved but temperature changes when changing the system parameters in an ideal experiment , such as adiabatically ramping up the optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the entropy can not directly be computed in quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "most often it is computed by integrating the specific heat over temperature , but also thermodynamic integration and quantum wang - landau sampling to obtain the full partition function have been tried  @xcite . for a uniform system",
    "the entropy is exponentially suppressed ( @xmath63 ) in the mott insulator , meaning that the mott insulator can not be reached under adiabatic changes  @xcite and that the system would heat into a normal phase .",
    "the normal phase , just as the mott insulator , has no interference peaks in time - of - flight images .",
    "fortunately , for a trapped system the entropy of the mott lobes is not important since the bosons in the edges of the cloud are normal .",
    "the edges can hence serve as an entropy reservoir . in ref .",
    "@xcite the width of the superfluid rings between the mott plateaus in the density wedding cake structure of the trapped bose - hubbard model was shown to be related to the total entropy in the system .",
    "it was argued that by ramping up the optical lattice , the confinement gets substantially tighter , the width of the superfluid regimes shrinks , and temperature may raise dramatically .",
    "however , quantum monte carlo simulations showed that this scenario was too pessimistic and that mott - like features ( which require a temperature lower than the crossover scale @xmath64  @xcite ) can easily be reached for realistic parameter regimes  @xcite . because the entropy is carried by the normal bosons and the largest volume fraction",
    "is found in the edges , one sees that for sufficiently deep lattices temperature scales with the on - site repulsion strength , @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "note that temperature can not be measured directly in the lattice system , although it can be accurately determined before the atoms are loaded in the lattice by time - of - flight images , provided the condensate fraction is not too high  @xcite .",
    "* since the system size is small and the number of measurement techniques limited , it is also difficult to determine transitions accurately .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that an accurate determination of the critical temperature for the normal to superfluid temperature is complicated because of the existence of strong , though non - divergent , peaks already present in the normal phase .",
    "together with the absence of a diverging length scale in the trapped system at the critical point , the precise determination of the critical point would be impossible .",
    "these arguments did not take the fresnel diffraction term into account ( which would rather enforce the argument ) .",
    "however , as we will discuss in detail below , trotzky _ et al .",
    "_ could accurately determine the full finite temperature phase diagram at unit filling in the trap center by monitoring the visibility , the condensate peak and its width  @xcite , showing that the arguments of refs .",

    "this has stimulated studies from the quantum optics community to better estimate and find solutions for this problematic behaviour  @xcite .",
    "one of the most amazing advances in the last couple of years is the single site resolution and addressability of atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "individual atoms can now be observed and addressed , typically in a 2d setup .",
    "when the measurement in the quantum gas microscope  @xcite is performed , the atoms are quickly brought into a very deep lattice suppressing tunneling .",
    "the atoms are then illuminated with an optical molasses that serves to localize the atoms while fluorescence photons are collected by the high resolution optics .",
    "in addition , light assisted collisions immediately eject atoms in pairs from the lattice site , leaving behind an atom only if the initial occupation is odd .",
    "remaining atoms scatter several thousand photons during the exposure time and can be detected with high fidelity .",
    "the density profiles were also shown to be in good agreement with monte carlo simulations  @xcite , and hence provide further evidence that thermodynamics is a valid description for these systems . also density - density correlation functions are now accessible experimentally , which for instance was demonstrated by measuring the parity operator for the 1d mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "we will now discuss two new opportunities for studying many - body physics which were made possible by the experimental advances in single - site resolution methods , namely the possibility to obtain the equation of state , and the study of critical phenomena .",
    "* single - site addressability could provide a means for obtaining the equation of state . in the edges the gas is in a normal phase , where measuring the density profile and comparing to high temperature series expansions  @xcite gives access to all thermodynamic quantities .",
    "if this procedure can not be followed , then temperature can still be determined by using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite @xmath72 which is valid in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
