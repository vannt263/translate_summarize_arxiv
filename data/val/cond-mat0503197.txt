    "rotational states of impurity atoms in crystalline solids affect the essential properties of solids at low temperatures .",
    "this is because the rotational degree of freedom of an impurity yields low - energy excitations that manifest themselves such low temperatures .",
    "a typical example is an interstitial oxygen impurity in covalent semiconductors such as si @xcite , ge @xcite , and gaas @xcite .",
    "the microscopic structure around oxygen impurities in those systems has been thoroughly studied in past .",
    "as - grown ge , for instance , is usually contaminated by more than @xmath2 oxygen atoms per cubic centimeter with a spatially random distribution .",
    "oxygen breaks a covalent bond between two ge atoms , establishing a puckered ge - o - ge segment . at low temperatures ,",
    "those interstitial oxygen atoms are quantum - mechanically delocalized in the annulus around the original bond center of ge - ge @xcite .",
    "the rotational degree of freedom of oxygen yields low - lying excitations in the far - infrared spectral region , which has been observed in phonon spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra deduced from these measurements can be accurately reproduced by a quantum rotor model @xcite ; each rotating ge@xmath3o unit within this model is mapped onto a quantum rigid rotor rotating in a two - dimensional plane that is perpendicular to the ge - ge axis .",
    "since the electronegativity of oxygen is larger than that of germanium , puckered segments of ge - o - ge carry electric dipole moments . in the dilute limit",
    ", the interaction between the dipole moments is negligible because the dipolar interaction decreases with the third power of distance .",
    "however , for actual concentrations of oxygen @xmath4 @xmath1 , a random distribution of oxygen impurities causes the occurrence of clusters of nearby dipole moments with a large coupling energy .",
    "if the coupling is strong , such that it is sufficient to interfere with the nearly free rotation of individual ge@xmath3o units , the quantum nature of the ge@xmath3o units that are involved in the clusters is completely different from those of the isolated ge@xmath3o units .",
    "recently , anomalous dielectric responses in coupled dipolar rotors have been reported @xcite , wherein the anomalies originate from peculiar low - lying excitations of the interacting dipolar rotors .",
    "therefore , it is expected that ensembles of clustered ge@xmath3o units play an important role in the low - temperature properties of ge : o ; specific heats and dielectric susceptibilities are cases in point .",
    "the present article theoretically investigates the effect of the dipolar interaction of rotating ge@xmath3o units on the low - temperature properties of ge : o .",
    "it is shown that the strong dipolar interaction between clustered ge@xmath3o units results in peculiar low - energy states , which in turn give rise to a power - law temperature dependence in specific heats @xmath5 below 0.1 k under our numerical conditions .",
    "further , dipolar transitions between the low - lying levels of the interacting ge@xmath3o units engender a non - trivial maxima in the dielectric susceptibilities @xmath6 around 1 k. the power - law behavior of specific heats is described by a scenario based on the presence of local double - well potentials in crystalline ge .",
    "it should be noted that this picture of _ crystalline _ solids is exceedingly analogous to the theoretical model , referred to as the two - level tunneling model , which describes the power - law specific heats in _ amorphous _ solids @xcite .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a quantum rotor model that accounts for the quantum rotation of the ge@xmath3o unit and formulate the hamiltonian for interacting quantum rotors that are coupled via dipolar interaction .",

    "figure [ fig_01 ] ( a ) illustrates the atomic disposition of a puckered ge - o - ge segment together with six ge atoms next nearest to the interstitial oxygen . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the oxygen atom is quantum - mechanically delocalized around the ge - ge axis .",
    "the delocalized oxygen is subjected to repulsive force from the six next - nearest neighboring ge atoms , thus experiencing an azimuthal potential having six - fold rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we call it a `` hindering potential ''",
    ".    recent isotope - shift measurements @xcite have revealed that the two ge atoms neighboring o are not fixed , but loosely bound around an external axis . as a consequence , all three atoms ( ge and o ) rotate in phase around the external axis as shown in fig .",

    "the difference of the electronegativity between ge and o causes the occurrence of an electric dipole moment in the direction perpendicular to the ge - ge axis .",
    "this allows us to map a rotating ge@xmath3o unit onto a quantum rotor having the moment of inertia @xcite @xmath13 amu@xmath14@xmath15 and an electric dipole moment @xcite @xmath16 debye .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 for an isolated rotor consists of two parts : @xmath18 the first term @xmath19 accounts for the kinetic energy of the rotor associated with its rotation , given by @xmath20 the quantity @xmath21 determines the energy scale of the quantum rotation .",

    "the thermal fluctuation suppresses the dipolar interaction between the rotors .",
    "therefore , we introduce the upper cut - off length @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 , or equivalently , @xmath38 within this cut - off length , the two rotors correlate via dipolar interaction .",

    "@xmath42 @xmath1 , this length is much less than the mean separation of adjacent rotors in ge : o .",
    "the length @xmath36 further shortens with increasing temperatures .",
    "therefore , most rotors may be considered as non - interacting rotors above the mk range .",
    "however , it should be noted that the inhomogeneous distribution of rotors makes the formation of clusters consisting of two or more rotors .",
    "these clustered rotors yield peculiar low - energy excitations originating from the dipolar interaction between rotors , which significantly affect the properties of ge : o at 1 k and below , as will be shown in the subsequent sections .",
    "hereafter , we fix the cut - off length @xmath43  for the temperature range under consideration ; for simplicity , we do not consider the discreteness of the lattice of ge crystals .    before closing this section , the spatial correlation of impurity distribution should be mentioned .",
    "we have assumed that no correlation exists in the distribution of oxygen impurities . yet",
    "this assumption is not always correct .",
    "when the sample is prepared by pulling from the melt , the correlation may be established at temperatures where oxygen impurities can diffuse .",
    "subsequently the correlated distribution of oxygen would be fixed on quenching .",
    "it is difficult to definitely account for this correlation since it depends essentially on the history of the sample preparation .",

    "the occurrence of the dipolar gap requires a large number of dipole moments interacting simultaneously .",
    "this is hardly realized in ge : o systems , since in crystalline ge there exists the upper limit of solubility of oxygen @xcite .",
    "namely , a high concentration of rotors sufficient to realize the dipole gap can not be achieved as far as ge : o systems are concerned .",
    "the second reason is the difference of the nature between _ classical _ dipole moments and _ quantum _ dipolar rotors .",
    "the derivation of the dipole gap in ref .",
    "@xcite was based on the classical motion of charged particles .",
    "differing from that , we have considered the quantum character of rotating ge@xmath3o units carrying dipole moments ; in addition , the rotation of the ge@xmath3o units is restricted to within a two - dimensional plane perpendicular to the ge - ge axis . thus the argument based on the coupled rotor model surely yields the density of states @xmath216 and the @xmath39-dependence of @xmath9 distinct from those in ref .",
    "independent of the relevance for ge : o , nevertheless , it is interesting whether or not the dipolar gap occurs in the quantum dipolar rotors in sufficiently dense concentrations .",
    "the scaling scheme for disordered spin systems @xcite may help to address this issue .",
    "it is known that the power - law specific heats at low temperatures have been observed in various kinds of amorphous materials @xcite . in those systems ,",
    "the power - law specific heats have been explained by a phenomenological model based on two - level tunneling states ( tlss ) with an assumed constant density of states @xcite .",
    "the presence of tlss in various amorphous solids has been confirmed by many experiments @xcite .",
    "there is , however , as yet no microscopic derivation for the tunneling states or for the constant density of states .",
    "in addition , the theoretical result @xmath99 differs somewhat from the observed behavior @xmath217 with small deviations @xmath218 depending on materials .",
    "recently found evidences for dipole - dipole interactions between tlss draw attention to the necessity of modifying or generalizing the simple tls picture @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is that the power - law specific heat in ge : o can be interpreted in line with the scenario analogous to that of the tunneling model .",
    "emphasis should be made on , nevertheless , the two crucial differences between the coupled - rotor model and the standard tls model as follows : ( i ) the coupled - rotor model gives the clear microscopic origin for double - well potentials randomly distributed in ge : o systems ; this is apparently in contrast with the phenomenological tls model applied to amorphous solids .",
    "( ii ) while the tls model in amorphous solids requires an artificial distribution function for two - level tunneling states , our model naturally yields the power - law distribution function with no artificial condition .",
