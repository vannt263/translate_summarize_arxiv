    "cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy measurements provide a means of constraining various cosmological models .",
    "several groups have reported measuring cmbr anisotropies at 0.5 to 1(@xcite ) . however , disentangling the primodial fluctuatations from foreground sources is problematic even if the foreground is understood .",
    "the third flight of max made an observation in a medium constrast dust region near the star mu pegasi and measured anisotropy smaller than seen elsewhere in the same flight ( @xcite ) . in order to confirm this measurement",
    ", we returned to the mu pegasi region with an additional low frequency band centered at 3.5 @xmath0 .",
    "max is an off - axis gregorian telescope with a bolometric photometer mounted on an attitude - controlled balloon platform .",
    "the instrument has been described extensively elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the telescope has a 1  m off - axis parabolic primary with an elliptical secondary which sinusoidally chops the beam in azimuth at 5.4  hz with a peak - to - peak throw of 14 .",
    "the chopped signal is demodulated with a sine - wave lock - in reference .",
    "the underfilled optics provide a 05  fwhm beam .",
    "an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator cools the single - pixel , four - band photometer to 85  mk .",
    "the four frequency bands are centered at 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14  @xmath0 with respective fractional bandwidths 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.4 , and 0.2 . to convert measured antenna temperature differences to 2.726  k thermodynamic temperature differences in each frequency band multiply by 1.62 , 2.50 , 6.66 , and 38.7 , respectively .",
    "the instrument was launched from the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas at 1.16  ut june  20 , 1994 .",
    "we observed cmbr anisotropies in three sky regions near the stars hr5127 , phi herculis , and mu pegasi ( @xmath6  =  22@xmath7497 , @xmath8  =  2434 ) .",
    "tanaka et al . ( 1996 ) report on the observations at hr5127 and phi herculis",
    ". this paper concerns the mu pegasi scan .    we observe with a constant velocity scan in azimuth of @xmath94  relative to the pointing star .",
    "the left - hand lobe of the antenna pattern was coaligned with the field of view of our ccd cameras and centered on mu pegasi .",
    "gyroscope drift was taken out every 400 seconds .",
    "the relative offset between the center of the chop and the target star was 055 in azimuth .    during the mu pegasi scan ( 7.22  ut to 7.76  ut ) the gyro malfunctioned and moved the chop center with",
    "a trajectory tilted 10@xmath10 degrees from horizontal .",
    "the orientation of the gondola was still vertical .",
    "we verified the orientation and trajectory with the positions of stars in the ccd camera field of view .",
    "we did not observe in the same orientation as in max3 and we do not expect the morphology to be identical .",
    "the other max 5 observations displayed no significant tilt .",
    "we calibrated the instrument before and after the observation using a membrane transfer standard ( @xcite ) .",
    "we observed jupiter from 4.86  ut to 4.95  ut to measure the beam size and position and to confirm the membrane calibration . using the best - fit beam size and the membrane calibration , the derived temperature of jupiter agrees with griffin et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to within 10% .",
    "we assume a 10% uncertainty in calibration .",
    "the calibration is such that a chopped beam centered between sky regions with temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 would yield @xmath13 in the absence of instrumental noise .",
    "anisotropy experiments are potentially susceptible to off - axis response to local sources , particularly the earth , the balloon , and the moon .",
    "the unchopped off - axis response in the 3.5 @xmath0 band is @xmath14 70  db below the on - axis response from 15  to 25  in elevation under the boresight .",
    "we have not made comparable measurements of the chopped sidelobe response in azimuth .",
    "mu pegasi was @xmath15 137  away from the moon during the observation .",
    "we remove transients due to cosmic rays using an algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "this procedure excludes approximately 18% of the data .",
    "we demodulate the detector output using the sinusoidal reference from the chopping secondary to produce antenna temperature differences @xmath16 on the sky .",
    "this produces a data set in phase and a data set 90  out of phase with the optical signal .",
    "the noise averaged over the observation gives respective cmbr sensitivities of 440 , 240 , 610 , and 5100 @xmath17 in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14  @xmath0 bands .",
    "the averages of the measured instrumental offsets in antenna temperature were 0.6 , 0.15 , 1.4 , and 2.8  mk in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands .",
    "we attribute this to chopped emissivity differences on the primary mirror and chopped atmospheric emission .",
    "the offset drifts in the higher frequency bands with amplitudes of 0.7  mk and 1.0  mk in the 9 and 14 @xmath0 bands over a time scale of  3 minutes .",
    "comparison of the first and second halves of the scan shows that the signal is stable in the 3.5 , 6 , and 9 @xmath0 bands , but not so in the 14 @xmath0 band .",
    "the instability in the 14 @xmath0 band could be caused by sidelobe pickup or atmosphere . to increase the stability ,",
    "we subtract an offset and gradient , as in a ground based observation , with a linear least squares fit to each pass going from -4  to + 4  or + 4  to -4 .",
    "each half scan takes 72  s.    for each observation we calculated the means and 1  @xmath18 uncertainty of the antenna temperature differences for 29 pixels separated by 17  on the sky .",
    "figure  [ mpant ] shows the antenna temperature differences as a function of scan angle for the mu pegasi scan .",
    "there is significant structure ( @xmath19  =  38 , 86 , 86 , 79 for 27 dof ) that is well correlated ( @xmath20 ) in all channels of the in - phase data .",
    "possible astrophysical sources for the signal in the mu pegasi scan are free - free or synchrotron radiation , interstellar dust ( isd ) emission , radio point sources , or cmbr . from the rising spectrum in @xmath21 in figure  [ mpant ]",
    "it is clear that cmbr , free - free or synchrotron radiation alone is not responsible for the signal .",
    "the latter two cases are also excluded by amplitude and morphology arguments .",
    "if we extrapolate the haslam 408 mhz map ( @xcite ) to our frequencies using @xmath22 for free - free emission and @xmath23 for synchrotron radiation and convolve with our chopped beam pattern , we find that the former produces @xmath24 of the signal in the 3.5  @xmath0 channel and the latter @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the morphology does not match that of the data .",
    "an automated point source search has yielded no candidates within 90  that could produce a signal greater than @xmath26 .",
    "previous experience in this region leads us to expect isd to be the main contributor to our high frequency signal .",
    "we convolved the iras 100  maps with our chopped beam pattern and produced simulated scans .",
    "we found the scale factors that minimized the reduced @xmath19 from 100  simulations to each data channel separately and then normalized them to the 3.5 @xmath0 band .",
    "the results are shown in table [ specfits ] .",
    "the best fit morphology and spectrum are superimposed over the data in figure  [ mpant ] .",
    "if we consider the 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands only , these scale factors indicate a warm dust spectrum @xmath27 , where @xmath2  =  1.3@xmath28 and t@xmath29  =  19@xmath30  k. this is consistent with our previous results ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the rise in amplitude in the 3.5 @xmath0 band is not well explained by a warm dust or warm and cold dust model .",
    "there are two possible causes for the rise in amplitude in the lowest band .",
    "one is a high frequency leak in the filters .",
    "pre - flight systematic tests with a thick grill high pass filter showed that high frequency leakage above 20  was less than 0.8% of the total band response to a 300k blackbody chopped relative to a 77k blackbody . using measured filter transmittances and the amplitude of dust fluctuations in this sky region ( fischer et al . 1995 ) , we calculated that maximum modeled high frequency leakage of power from dust fluctuations contributes less than @xmath151% of the expected inband power from cmb fluctuations and less than 2% of the observed structure .",
    "another candidate is a correlated low frequency component .. however , our cross - correlation coefficient 3.5 @xmath31 which should be compared to @xmath32 for @xmath33 however , fits of two component models did not conclusively distinguish between the possibilities , such as cmbr + isd and hii + isd .",
    "we conclude the following about the foreground contaminant : the correlation between the 14 @xmath0 band and the other bands indicates a single foreground morphology . whatever the nature of the foreground , the relative amplitudes in the bands are given in table [ specfits ] column 2 . because of the excellent fit of the iras 100  maps to the 14 @xmath0 channel ,",
    "we assume that the isd dominates over any other possible high frequency contaminant .",
    "we analyze the three channels most sensitive to cmbr , 3.5 , 6 and 9 @xmath0 for anisotropy in the presence of a single foreground morphology with the spectrum found above .",
    "we use maximum likelihood methods assuming uniform prior to set limits of the rms temperature fluctuation in the data , @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the likelihood , l , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the data vector of all 29 bins and 3 channels and @xmath37 is the full covariance matrix for a flat band power spectrum .",
    "we marginalize the data to account for the best fit foreground spectrum given in table [ specfits ] and the offset and gradient removal ( @xcite ) . to do so",
    ", we construct a data vector and covariance matrix , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 account for both a single foreground spectrum and offset and gradient removal respectively . using @xmath42 and @xmath43 in equation ( [ likelihood ] )",
    "yields an upper limit , @xmath44 23 @xmath45k ( 95% confidence level ) or @xmath46 .",
    "when max3 mu pegasi is analyzed in a fashion similar to this paper , we find @xmath47k ( 95% confidence level ) when marginalized for the dust model in @xcite .",
    "the two data sets are consistent with each other for similar analysis techniques .",
    "furthermore , the max5 mu pegasi upper limit is consistent with the result from hr5127 ( @xmath48 ) although roughly so with phi herculis ( @xmath49 ) which were also observed in that flight .",
    "we have presented new results from a search for cmbr anisotropy with high sensitivity at 05 angular scales near the star mu pegasi .",
    "free - free and synchrotron radiation are excluded as the main source of signal on amplitude and spectral arguments .",
    "there are no strong point sources in the field .",
    "the morphology of the observed structure is consistent with known interstellar dust but not the spectrum .",
    "the structure in the 6 , 9 and 14 @xmath0 channels is fit by a single dust model power law @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and @xmath52  k. we can not rule out the possibility that the structure is a correlated combination of dust and cmbr or dust and free - free radiation .",
    "linear combinations of the data independent of the best fit spectrum yield a @xmath53 .",
    "( 95% confidence level ) the results are consistent with our previous observation in the region .",
    "these data are available from the authors .",
