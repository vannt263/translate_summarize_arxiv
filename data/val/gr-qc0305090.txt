    "as is well known , three - dimensional pure einstein gravity is a topological theory and has no propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "the solutions are locally flat apart from conical singularities at the location of matter sources in no cosmological constant case  @xcite",
    ". moreover , cosmological gravity and supergravity are solvable in many cases  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional supergravity has been investigated in various situations intensively .",
    "as particular examples , the non - linear sigma models coupled to @xmath2-extended supergravity were studied  @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the target manifolds parametrized by scalar fields were classified completely : the target space is riemanian , khler , and quaternionic for @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "for @xmath5 it generally decomposes into two separate quaternionic spaces , associated with inequivalent supermultiplets . for @xmath6",
    "there is a symmetric space for any given number of supermultiplets . for @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "there are only theories based on a single supermultiplet associated with coset spaces with the exceptional isometry groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .    moreover , the three - dimensional maximal ( @xmath11 gauged supergravity were constructed  @xcite . the duality relation between the gauge fields and the scalar field plays an important role in the derivation of the ungauged @xmath12 supergravity : in order to expose its global @xmath13 isometry , all vector fields obtained by dimensional reduction of the @xmath14 supergravity in an eight - torus must be dualized into the scalar fields .",
    "moreover , in order for the supergravity to gauge , the chern - simons term ( rather than the yang - mills term ) must be required in the lagrangian .",
    "recently the supersymmetric vortex solutions in @xmath0-gauged @xmath15 supergravity whose scalar sector is an arbitrary khler manifold with @xmath0 isometry were constructed  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the einstein equations and the matter field equations of the model can be recast into a set of self - duality equations for a specific eighth - order choice of the higgs potential which reduces to the sixth - order potential of the flat space model when the newton gravitational coupling constant is set to zero .",
    "the abelian chern - simons higgs model in three - dimensional minkowski space - times and its vortex solutions were studied by  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the model with a specific sixth - order higgs potential admits topologically stable vortex solutions and non - topological soliton solutions with nonzero flux and charge , which satisfy the bogomolnyi - type or the first order self - duality equations  @xcite . in the bogomolnyi limit",
    ", there is a ( first - order ) phase transition point between the symmetric ( non - topological solutions ) and the asymmetric phase ( topological vortex solutions ) .    in this paper , we construct the non - topological solitons , which do not preserve the supersymmetry , in three - dimensional @xmath0-gauged @xmath1 supergravity and find the region where the solutions can exist for various value of a cosmological constant .",
    "a further motivation for studying the non - topological solitons is that this model provided us with the simplest model of relativistic stars as self - gravitating systems .",
    "rotating boson stars with large self - coupling constant in three dimensions were studied in  @xcite , for example .",
    "the study of the non - topological soliton will lead to a new aspect of the self - gravitating systems .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows ; in the next section we introduce the model and the basic ingredients . for the construction of the @xmath0-gauged @xmath16 , @xmath1 supergarvity lagrangian",
    ", we refer the reader to the existing literature  @xcite . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we restrict ourselves to the simple case of the khler manifold and a circularly symmetric ansatz for the metric which approaches asymptotically the btz configuration  @xcite , which is asymptotically anti - de sitter space ( rather than asymptotically flat ) and does not preserve the supersymmetry in general . in this setting",
    "we obtain numerically the non - topological solitons with zero - winding number case for various values of a cosmological constant . in the section  [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we show the numerical results and discuss the relation among the physical parameters for various values of a cosmological constant .",
    "in this section we consider ungauged @xmath1 three - dimensional supergarvity . assuming a @xmath0 isometry of the khler potential",
    ", we apply the noether procedure to obtain the @xmath0-gauged @xmath1 supergarvity  @xcite .",
    "the field content of the ungauged theory is the following .    *",
    "the @xmath1 supergravity multiplet @xmath17 contains a graviton  @xmath18  and two gravitini which are assembled into one complex spinor @xmath19 . *",
    "the @xmath1 scalar multiplet @xmath20 contains the fermions @xmath21 and scalars @xmath22 with @xmath23 , respectively in the complex notation .",
    "the matter sector is obtained by @xmath24 copies of the @xmath1 scalar multiplet .",
    "the scalar fields define a khler manifold of real dimension @xmath25 , characterized by its khler potential @xmath26 .",
    "it is assumed that the ungauged @xmath1 supergarvity is invariant under the global @xmath0 isometry . as in the maximally gauged supergravity theories  @xcite ,",
    "the chern - simons term is required , in order to gauge the @xmath0 khler isometry .",
    "note that this term is topological and hence does not introduce new propagating degrees of freedom in the gauged theory .",
    "moreover , the @xmath27-dependent terms , due to the chern - simons terms , give rise to extra terms in supersymmetry transformations . in order to compensate these terms ,",
    "the extra yukawa - type bilinear fermionic terms and a scalar potential must be added to the lagrangian",
    ".    then the bosonic parts of the @xmath0-gauged @xmath16 , @xmath1 supergarvity lagrangian is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a covariant derivative and @xmath30 denotes the khler metric @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is an abelian field strength and @xmath27 is a gauge coupling constant .",
    "@xmath33 is a real scalar potential , which will be mentioned in the next section .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simple case of the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) considered in the preceding section .",
    "we adopt a single complex scalar field case , that is @xmath34 .",
    "moreover we assume that the @xmath35 is a function of @xmath36 only and the khler potential is @xmath37 in order to obtain the canonical kinetic term for the scalar field .",
    "we thus find that the @xmath38 is unity .",
    "then , the eighth - order scalar potential is reduced to : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary real constant parameters .",
    "we assume the three - dimensional metric for a circularly symmetric spacetimes as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only .    for the single complex scalar field , we also assume the following dependence on the coordinates : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only and @xmath49 is a constant .",
    "we impose the boundary condition that @xmath50 approaches zero when the radial coordinate @xmath46 is taken to infinity , in order to obtain the non - topological soliton .    for the vector field @xmath51 , we choose the gauge , in order to require finite energy solution for the scalar field at radial infinity , in which @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only .    varying the lagrangian with respect to the gauge field , the scalar field and the metric yields equations of motion .",
    "the equation of motion for the chern - simons term induces the first order equations @xmath55 and two of these equations take the form @xmath56 and the third one ( @xmath57 ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "the scalar field equation is reduced to the form : @xmath58    the einstein equation is also reduced to : @xmath59,\\\\   \\frac{\\delta}{r}\\delta'&=&-2\\kappa^2\\left   [ \\frac{e^{2\\delta}}{\\delta}g^2r^2   ( w+\\omega p)^2+\\delta(r')^2\\right],\\\\   \\frac{\\delta}{2r^2}(r^3e^{\\delta}\\omega')'&= &   2\\kappa^2g^2r^2pe^{\\delta}\\frac{w+\\omega p}{r}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we set the metric which approaches asymptotically the btz solution when the scalar field falls into a vacuum of the negative value at radial infinity . in this setting , one can find that the cosmological constant @xmath60 is obtained to be @xmath61 and as analyzed in  @xcite , the physical parameters ( the btz mass , the angular momentum and the magnetic flux ) is the following : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a sufficiently large value for radial coordinate @xmath46 .",
    "these equations unfortunately can not be solved analytically .",
    "then we will find the numerical solution . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the relation among the physical parameters for various values of a cosmological constant .",
    "in this paper , we have numerically constructed the non - topological solitions in three - dimensional @xmath0-gauged @xmath64@xmath65 supergravity .",
    "the non - topological soliton does not preserve the supersymmetry , in general , because the metric is described by the btz solution at radial infinity .",
    "we have found that the region of the solutions can exist for the non - topological solitons in fig .  1 , shown with the btz mass @xmath66 , the angular momentum @xmath67 and the magnetic flux @xmath68 for various values of the cosmological constant @xmath60 . in fig .  2 , we find two branches in a sequence of the solutions which are obtained numerically by the different conditions ( values of the scalar field and the vector field at the origin ) .",
    "one branch is the solutions from the origin to the maximal value of the @xmath66 , the other is from the point @xmath69 to the maximal value . as studied in  @xcite , one can also compare the results with black hole physics . in the case of the black hole",
    ", it is known that a black hole with a larger angular momentum than the critical one has a naked singularity and can not be the usual black hole .",
    "moreover there is the relation @xmath70 which is satisfied by the extreme black hole .",
    "if the non - topological soliton becomes a black hole , the soliton with @xmath71 can become the usual black hole .",
    "the non - topological soliton with @xmath72 can not be the usual black hole and the soliton with a large mass can certainly become an extreme black hole .",
    "thus , the region of the solutions for the non - topological solitons is plausible as self - gravitating systems because all of the maximal values for the soliton s mass exist in the area @xmath71 . in fig  3 ,",
    "if we fit the plotted line with a solid line , one can find that the @xmath67 is proportional to the square of the @xmath68 .",
    "this is the same results as in the minkowski space - time case , as known in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relation between the angular momentum and the magnetic flux is not dependent of the cosmological constant .",
    "there is a phase transition point between the symmetric and the asymmetric phase in the abelian chern - simons higgs model in minkowski space - times . on the other hands , in the @xmath0-gauged @xmath64@xmath65 supergravity",
    ", differed from the usual phase transition , there is not a non - topological soliton in the transition point because the metric approaches asymptotically anti de - sitter space - time",
    ". it may be crucial in cosmological situation though this model has still three - dimensions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we have treated the soliton with zero - winding number case , i.e. @xmath73 only .",
    "we will further investigate the binding energy , the stability of the soliton .",
