    "once we consider perturbations on the top of a homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robsertson - walker universe , inflation generically predicts quasi - scale - invariant spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations .",

    "ligo and virgo will see their sensitivity improved by a factor of @xmath0 in the next few years and might detect the first gravitational wave as early as 2015 .",

    "non - detection of tensor modes at cmb scales strongly constrains a scale invariant background of tensors of inflationary origin to @xmath6 .",
    "since the spectrum of primordial tensor modes is generically flat or slightly red , none of these detectors is usually expected to be able to detect tensor modes produced during inflation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we note that production of particles during inflation generates a feature in the tensor spectrum which could be detectable by gravitational interferometers in the ( relatively ) near future , without conflicting with cmb constraints .",
    "nonperturbative production of particles during inflation , first studied in  @xcite , is possible because the rolling inflaton provides a time - dependent background that carries the energy necessary for the production of light species .",
    "the simplest and most studied example of such a system is given by a scalar field @xmath7 whose mass depends on the inflaton @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath7 becomes effectively massless as the inflaton rolls down its potential , then it becomes energetically cheap to produce its quanta . in this case",
    ", particle production happens at a precise moment during inflation determined by the time when the total mass of @xmath7 crosses zero .",

    ", the field can stay massless as the inflaton rolls down its potential , and particle production can happen steadily during inflation .    particles produced through these mechanisms carry energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 , which perturbs the frw metric into : @xmath10 where we use conformal time , and by a overdot a derivative with respect to the cosmological time @xmath11 : @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 . ]",

    "if particle production happens explosively at a precise time during inflation ( as in  @xcite ) , the spectrum of gravitational waves will show a feature at the scale corresponding to the time of particle production .",
    "if particle production happens continuously , on the other hand , then the spectrum of induced tensor modes will be smoother .",
    "it is worth noting that , since the source of the gravitational waves is quadratic in a gaussian field , @xmath24 is expected to have a maximal three point function @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the direct detectability of tensor modes produced during inflation was also considered by  @xcite , where it was shown that , if the post - inflationary universe is dominated by a fluid stiffer than radiation , the primordial tensors amplitude can be significantly enhanced .",
    "more recently ,  @xcite has studied the detectability of gravitational waves produced by phase transitions during inflation .    in section 2",
    "we show that the explosive production of quanta of a scalar field @xmath7 can only generate a tiny correction to the background , quasi - scale invariant spectrum of tensor modes .",
    "a scenario  `` trapped inflation ''  where explosive production of particles occurs several times per efolding of inflation has been considered in  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "particle production slows down the rolling of the inflaton so that inflation can occur even on a ( relatively ) steep potential .",
    "our analysis will allow , in section 2 c , the evaluation of the amplitude of the tensors induced by the trapping fields .    in section 3 we study a mechanism analogous to that of section 2 , where the scalar field @xmath7 is replaced by a vector field @xmath26 .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced in this case is equal to that found in section 2 , multiplied by a factor two that accounts for the two helicity modes of the vector field .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the case of tensor modes produced through a gauge field coupled to an axion - like inflaton ( as discussed in  @xcite and , in greater detail , in  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the amplitude of gravitational waves can increase dramatically at smaller scales so that the system can obey the wmap constraint on primordial tensors at cmb scales and still lead to detectable tensors at scales probed by ground - based laser intereferometers .",
    "several systems can lead to the production of particles during inflation .",
    "the one that has received the most attention is described by the lagrangian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the potential supporting inflation and where we neglect for simplicity the self - interactions of the field @xmath7 .",
    "if the inflaton @xmath29 , while slowly rolling down @xmath28 , crosses the value @xmath30 , then the field @xmath7 becomes momentarily massless , and its quanta can be copiously produced .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite shows that the occupation number of @xmath7 , shortly after @xmath8 crossed @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 at the time @xmath8 crosses @xmath30 .",

    "such coupling , however , generates only a moderate occupation number of superhorizon photons  @xcite and , as a consequence , is not expected to induce an important production of tensors .",
    "we can now study the production of gravitational waves induced by the helical photons . to do so",
    ", we plug the expression  ( [ approx1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ hijvec ] ) , and we project onto its left- and right - handed components . of course , one should also take into account the parity - symmetric component of gravitons that is generated by the usual amplification of vacuum fluctuations in de sitter space .",
    "this is uncorrelated from those discussed above so that the overall power spectra of the helicity-@xmath228 components of the graviton can be written for @xmath229 ( as we will see , this is the regime we are interested in ) as @xmath230 we thus see that , as a consequence of the violation of parity , the amplitude of the spectra of the left- and the right - handed tensor modes generated by the gauge field differs by a factor @xmath231 . while the parity violating component could in principle be exponentially large , it was pointed out in  @xcite that the gauge field also contributes , through its coupling with the inflaton , to the spectrum of scalar perturbations .",
    "this contribution is highly nongaussian , and its amplitude is therefore strongly constrained by the non - observation of nongaussianities in the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structure bispectra .",
    "it turns out that the parameter @xmath224 , when computed at cmb and at lss scales , is constrained to be smaller than about @xmath232 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath224-dependent contribution to the tensor spectra  ( [ main ] ) , when computed at cosmological scales , is negligibly small .",
    "now , the main observation of this section is that the quantity @xmath233 is _ time dependent _ and increases as the inflaton rolls down its potential .",
    "the condition @xmath234 originates from constraints from cmb and lss data .",
    "therefore @xmath224 had to be smaller than @xmath232 when lss scales exited the horizon .",
    "however , @xmath224 can be much larger at later times when scales relevant to gravitational wave interferometers left the horizon .",
    "since there are some @xmath235 efoldings of inflation between the time lss scales left the horizon and the time ligo scales left the horizon  @xcite , it is necessary to consider the entire shape of the inflationary potential to know how @xmath224 evolves . in the next subsection",
    "we will study in detail , as an example , the parameter space for this scenario in the case of a quadratic inflationary potential . as we will see , there exists a portion of parameter space where advanced ligo will be able to observe gravitational waves even if the current bound from nongaussianities is satisfied .",

    "the star denotes the projected sensitivity of advanced ligo . ]      in this subsection we study the power spectrum of the gravitational waves  ( [ main ] ) in the case where the inflaton potential takes the chaotic form @xmath237 .",
    "the model of natural chaotic inflation of  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) leads precisely to this situation : a pseudoscalar inflaton with a quadratic potential",
    ". other forms of the potential for a pseudoscalar inflaton were considered in the models of inflation from axion monodromy  @xcite , and we expect that the predictions from these models will not differ significantly from those presented here .    in the case of the chaotic potential @xmath237 , the value of @xmath8 during inflation is related to the number @xmath238 of efoldings before the end of inflation through @xmath239 .",
    "the parameter @xmath240 can be determined by cobe normalization .",
    "denoting by @xmath241 the number of efoldings corresponding to cobe scales ( @xmath242 depending on the details of reheating  @xcite ) , we have @xmath243 where @xmath244 .",
    "using the slow roll parameter @xmath245 , we can write @xmath246 as @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the value of @xmath224 computed @xmath241 efoldings before the end of inflation .",
    "we require @xmath249 in order not to generate nongaussianities in the cmb which are too large .",
    "note that a comparable constraint on nongaussianities originates from the large scale structures at wavenumbers @xmath250  mpc@xmath251 ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) , which correspond to scales that left the horizon about @xmath252 efoldings before the end of inflation .    inserting the above expressions into eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) , we obtain the following expression of the energy density in gravitational waves as a function of @xmath238 @xmath253\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since gravitational waves at a frequency @xmath203 correspond to scales that exited the horizon about @xmath254 efoldings after the cobe scales , we can plot @xmath1 as a function of @xmath203 for given @xmath241 and @xmath248 by setting @xmath255 in equation  ( [ omegagw ] ) .",
    "we plot in figure 2 the spectrum of gravitational waves for a representative set of parameters .",
    "the parameter space of this system is constrained by the following requirements : first , the backreaction of the electromagnetic modes on the inflating background must be negligible ; second , the nongaussianities induced by the same electromagnetic modes through the mechanism discussed in  @xcite must be within the limits imposed both by cmb and by lss observations .",
    "backreaction on the inflating background is negligible for  @xcite @xmath256 , i.e. , @xmath257 this implies that , if we want backreaction to be negligible all the way to a frequency @xmath203 , this condition must be satisfied with @xmath258 .    as for nongaussianities ,",
    "the bound of  @xcite , when evaluated at cobe scales , gives the constraint @xmath259 .",
    "comparable bounds also apply to nongaussianities evaluated at large scale structure scales that left the horizon some @xmath260 efoldings after cobe scales .",
    "we therefore impose @xmath261 .",

    "the shaded area on the top left corner corresponds to the region where backreaction can not be neglected and our analysis can not be trusted .",
    "the shaded area on the top part of the plot corresponds to the region where lss nongaussianities are too large to be consistent with observations .",
    "the shaded area at the bottom corresponds to the region where the amplitude of tensor modes is below the advanced ligo detection threshold .",
    "finally , the thinner dotted line corresponds to the lower limit of portion of parameter space accessible to an instrument such as the einstein telescope.,title=\"fig : \" ]    advanced ligo is expected to be able to detect @xmath262 at a frequency of about @xmath263  hz . the white area in figure 3 corresponds to the region of parameter space where primordial tensor modes might be detected by advanced ligo without contradicting the constraints described above .",
    "detection would be possible for values of @xmath248 of the order of @xmath264 , corresponding to @xmath265  gev .",
    "the shaded area in the upper - left corner of the figure corresponds to a region of the parameter space where backreaction of the electromagnetic modes on the inflating background can not be neglected , and an analysis similar to that of  @xcite is needed . while such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present work , it is worth stressing that that region can not be excluded by existing data and might lead to detectable tensor modes .",
    "an instrument such as the einstein telescope  @xcite would be a factor @xmath113 more sensitive in energy than advanced ligo while working at the same frequencies . the thin dotted line in figure 3 delimits the region of parameter space that would lead to a detection of tensors by such an instrument .",
    "space - based interferometers like lisa , which are sensitive to much lower frequencies , will not be able to detect the tensors  ( [ main ] ) .",
    "indeed , lisa scales are too close to cosmological scales and the evolution of @xmath224 during inflation is not sufficient to overcome the constraints from nongaussianities .",
    "we also note that the gravitational waves produced this way will be chiral  @xcite and that  @xcite discussed the prospects of a direct detection of a background of chiral stochastic gravitational waves .",
    "these gravitational waves will also have a large  @xcite , parity violating  @xcite three point function .",
    "finally , it is nice to speculate how a detection of chiral gravitational waves such as those described by  ( [ main ] ) could correlate with the detection of nongaussianities such as those discussed by  @xcite at cosmological scales : observation of both the nongaussian signal in the cmb and of gravitational waves at ligo scales would provide a test of inflation at very different times .    _ to summarize , _ we have shown that particle production during inflation generally leads to a feature in the spectrum of tensor modes .",
    "if such a feature happens at the right wavelengths , the tensors might be directly detectable by gravitational interferometers .",
    "we have seen that production of scalar or vector quanta during inflation generates only a modest amount gravitational waves .",
    "however , the analysis of section 4 shows that , if the inflaton is an axion coupled to a @xmath266 gauge field , it can lead to an amplification of gravitational waves that would be directly detectable by advanced ligo and/or advanced virgo in the next few years .",
