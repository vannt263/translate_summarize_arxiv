    "in the course of molecular dynamics calculations of the frequency spectrum of commensurate monolayer solids of nitrogen adsorbed on graphite [ [ ref : hb95 ] , [ ref : hbt95 ] ] , we became aware of paradoxical phenomena in what was expected to be the most ideal and simple regime . at low temperatures the center - of - mass one - phonon approximation to the intermediate scattering function has a nearly pure sinusoidal oscillation over periods of 20 to 50 @xmath0 ; however the amplitude generally is quite different from that anticipated from equipartition theory for harmonic oscillators and from a sum - rule of hansen and klein [ [ ref : hk ] ] .",
    "there is some indication in the simulation data that the mean - square oscillation amplitude , averaged over hundreds of picoseconds , is on the scale expected for oscillator coordinates .",
    "the only suggestions of such phenomena which we have found in the literature are a comment by hansen and klein [ [ ref : hk ] ] that their sum - rule was satisfied to 10% except at small wave numbers where spectral peaks were quite sharp and a comment by shrimpton and steele [ [ ref : ss91 ] ] that simulation times much longer than 400 @xmath0 would be needed to ensure thermal equilibration of the long - lived brillouin - zone - center phonons of commensurate krypton / graphite .",
    "a nanosecond time scale is inferred from experiments and modeling of the sliding friction of incommensurate inert gas monolayers on metal surfaces [ [ ref : dk ] ] , but the relative importance of processes determining such long lifetimes is in dispute [ [ ref : pn ] ] .",
    "we have used perturbation theory for the effect of cubic and quartic anharmonicity in the adatom ",
    "substrate interaction on the lifetime of the adlayer phonons[[ref : kk61 ] , [ ref : mf62 ] ] . with parameters appropriate to commensurate krypton / graphite and to a spherical molecule version of commensurate nitrogen / graphite ,",
    "the estimated zone - center phonon lifetimes again are on the scale of nanoseconds .",
    "such processes are not likely to be the dominant ones in determining the lifetimes , as has been appreciated by mills and his co - workers [ [ ref : hmb ] , [ ref : hm89 ] ] .",
    "the principal mechanism which sets the lifetimes of zone - center phonons in a commensurate monolayer solid is the radiative damping arising because the adlayer normal mode is actually a surface resonance that overlaps a continuum of substrate normal modes [ [ ref : hmb ] ] . in previous modeling of this process ,",
    "the substrate was treated as an isotropic elastic medium .",
    "there was good success in explaining the phonon line - widths ( for motions primarily polarized perpendicular to the substrate surface ) of inert gases adsorbed on metals [ [ ref : hm89 ] ] .",
    "the time scale for such damping is of the order of picoseconds and the damping is expected to be larger for a low - density substrate such as graphite than for high - density metal substrates .",
    "inelastic helium atomic scattering experiments for xenon adsorbed on graphite [ [ ref : tv89 ] ] and for commensurate and incommensurate krypton monolayers on graphite [ [ ref : cjd92 ] ] give evidence for a strong mixing of the adlayer perpendicular vibration with substrate modes over a range of wave vectors and for strong damping of the normal modes at small wavenumbers .    here , we develop the elastic substrate theory for the case of adsorption on the ( 0001 ) ( @xmath1-axis ) surface of a hexagonal substrate .",

    "solid , there is a brillouin zone - center gap for motions both parallel and perpendicular to the substrate surface ; the radiative damping mechanism acts for both polarizations .",
    "the long wavelength motions of graphite parallel to the surface plane are governed by isotropic elasticity theory , a simplification relative to the situation for the ( 111 ) surface of face - centered - cubic metals .",
    "the large elastic anisotropy of graphite between motions parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis has the consequence that the strong radiative damping is confined to a much smaller fraction of the adlayer brillouin zone for the branch with parallel polarization than for that with perpendicular polarization .",

    "the extrapolated crossing using the initial slope of the ta@xmath224mode is @xmath225 @xmath183 .",
    "however , including the strong anomalous dispersion of the ta@xmath224branch with the prescription in eq.([eq : kkc ] ) , leads to a semi - quantitative account of the crossing .",
    "second , we examine the radiative damping for the in - plane zone - center gap @xmath165 .",
    "the region of strong damping for peaks of @xmath226 is confined to region i defined in sec.iv.b.1 , i.e. , to the left of the substrate sp@xmath135 threshold shown in the figures . in region",
    "ii , between the sp@xmath135 and ta@xmath2 thresholds , the widths of the peaks in @xmath215 are small but finite and correspond to lifetimes on the scale of @xmath227 .",
    "the large elastic anisotropy of the graphite makes region i much smaller than for the isotropic elastic medium : using the parameters for ag(111 ) in sec.v.b the ratio @xmath228 is 0.38 , but for graphite it is less than 0.1 for @xmath229 @xmath183 .",
    "another manifestation of the large elastic anisotropy is that the elliptical polarization of the rayleigh wave nearly degenerates to a transverse ( @xmath55 ) polarization , with only weak coupling to in - plane motions of the adlayer .",
    "third , the damping of the @xmath87 branch is very strong in both regions i and ii .",
    "in contrast to the model for xe / ag(111 ) , figure 1 , we obtain only one sharp resonance ( denoted by @xmath230 ) in @xmath216 for region iii .",
    "the figures show a large shift of the resonant frequency in region iii relative to the value for the static substrate used as input to the calculation .",
    "finally , we compare the resonant frequencies themselves with the atomistic calculations of dewette and coworkers [ [ ref : rawx ] , [ ref : rawk ] ] at large @xmath47 for a test of the size of effects of the neglected spatial dispersion .",
    "the most significant discrepancy is that ` deflection ' of the trajectories in the region of the avoided level crossing is much larger for the continuum calculation than in the atomistic calculation . in the elastic continuum theory ,",
    "the shift remains on the order of 10% to the largest @xmath47 of the calculation ; this is a 50% larger shift than in the atomistic calculations .",
    "the dispersion with @xmath47 of the peak ` @xmath231 ' ( @xmath73 and @xmath232 ) of @xmath215 , from effects of adatom  adatom interactions , is similar to that in the atomistic calculations .",
    "the present calculations show the @xmath231 branch crossing the ta@xmath2 branch ( actually , the rayleigh mode ) , as do the atomistic calculations .",
    "the main previous test of the elastic continuum theory of radiative damping was for the damping of incommensurate inert gas adlayers on pt(111 ) [ [ ref : hm89 ] ] , where the formalism tended to underestimate the zone - center damping .",
    "the factor of ten in the mass density of the substrate between graphite and platinum has the effect of making the damping much larger for xe / graphite .",
    "this was anticipated by toennies and vollmer [ [ ref : tv89 ] ] in their discussion of the rather broad peaks for the @xmath197mode in the @xmath88 inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "these calculations show that the radiative damping mechanism proposed by hall et al . has a major effect on line - widths which may be observed in inelastic scattering experiments from commensurate adlayers on graphite .",
    "the understanding of the coupling of the commensurate layer to the substrate is more advanced for substrates such as graphite than for metallic substrates .",
    "thus , adsorbates on graphite may be good subjects for detailed further study .",
    "it would be of interest to determine whether there are related effects of substrate dynamics on the monolayer fluid which would disrupt the _ long - time _",
    "tails seen in molecular dynamics simulations of the n@xmath233/graphite fluid for 1 to 10 ps .",
    "another question is how to relate the size of the avoided level crossing of an adlayer mode and the substrate rayleigh mode to adlayer ",
    "substrate coupling constants .",
    "comparison of our elastic continuum results to the model calculations of dewette and co - workers indicates that there are significant effects of spatial dispersion to be included .",
    "this might be explored in future work based on a technique such as lattice green s functions[[ref : hm89 ] ] , now that the elastic continuum theory is in place . for the damping at intermediate and large wave numbers ,",
    "where the radiative damping mechanism becomes small , a treatment of the more conventional anharmonic damping will be needed [ [ ref : hm89 ] ] .",
    "the large differences in the damping of parallel and perpendicular motions for the commensurate monolayer on graphite seem well - based and may have ironic consequences .",
