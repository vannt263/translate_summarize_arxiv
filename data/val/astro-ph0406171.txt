    "the central region of about 330pc has been the site of active star formation at a rate of about @xmath6yr@xmath3 for some @xmath7  years . however , a recent significant increase in the star formation rate made it the dominating source of the uv flux @xcite .    with its strong heii @xmath84686 line @xcite ,",
    "ngc7714 has been classified as a wolf - rayet galaxy .",
    "in fact , the optical and uv spectra indicate a population of about 2000 wolf - rayet and 20000 o - type stars , suggesting a fairly young age of the present starburst of @xmath9  myr @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite who estimated @xmath10  o5-type stars from the balmer and bracket-@xmath11 line fluxes , and masses of ionized gas of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the radio - continuum and the x - ray luminosity of @xmath14  ergss@xmath3 require @xmath10  supernova remnants in a volume of radius 280pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite found definite evidence for a starburst - driven bipolar winds from the nucleus , nearly perpendicular to the disk plane .    although most of the activity is concentrated in the nucleus , ngc7714 as a whole is experiencing intense star formation @xcite .",
    "mid - ir imaging with _",
    "@xcite revealed a strong source at the nucleus surrounded by slightly extended emission out to about @xmath15 ( 5.7  kpc ) in diameter . from the _ iras",
    "_ fluxes @xcite and the above distance we calculate a total infrared luminosity of @xmath16 .",
    "the strong optical emission lines , h@xmath17 and [ oiii ] , show no signs of broad emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite found two compact x - ray sources with _ xmm - newton_. one of them coincides with the starburst nucleus , has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath18  ergs@xmath3 , and shows the spectrum of a thin thermal plasma with a power - law ( point - source ) contribution .",
    "the variability in the power - law component hints at the presence of either a hidden low luminosity agn or an ultraluminous x - ray source @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we describe new observations of ngc7714 with the _ spitzer space telescope_. these observations are part of an irs guaranteed time program to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra of a large sample of different classes of nearby galaxies , that can be used for comparison with more distant systems ( devost et al .",

    "[ secdatared ]    we observed ngc7714 with the infrared spectrograph ( _ irs _ ) @xcite on board the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite . the observations are part of the _ irs _ guaranteed time program .",
    "the data were taken during the first _ irs _ campaign in nominal operations on 17 december 2003 using the standard irs `` staring mode '' astronomical observing template ( aot ) .",
    "the dataset consists of observations with all four irs modules : 2 cycles @xmath19 14s in `` short - low '' ( sl , @xmath20 m , @xmath21 ) , 2 cycles @xmath19 14s in `` long - low '' ( ll , @xmath22 m , @xmath21 ) , 4 cycles @xmath19 30s in `` short - high '' ( sh , @xmath23 m , @xmath24 ) , and 2 cycles @xmath19 60s in `` long - high '' ( lh , @xmath25 m , @xmath24 ) .",
    "each cycle yields two exposures at different nod positions along the slit .",
    "the slits were positioned relative to the reference star sao  128273 using an `` irs high accuracy peak - up '' in the blue filter band .",
    "the data have been pre - processed by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) data reduction pipeline version 9.5 ( spitzer observer s manual , chapter  7 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional `` basic calibrated data '' ( bcd ) constituted the basis for further processing .",
    "the bcd frames have been individually inspected by eye , and hot pixels , as well as very negative pixels , that have not already been flagged by the pipeline , were masked manually .",
    "the former could easily be identified by flipping between images at different nod positions .",
    "tests have shown that masked pixels introduce artificially high noise in the spectra , and hence we interpolated isolated masked pixels by their nearest neighbor pixel values along the dispersion direction .",
    "next we averaged the frames from the same nod positions ( in the case of sh where four frames per nod position were available we have used the median instead ) .",
    "since the low - resolution , long - slit modules contain two sub - slits , each integration provides a `` free '' sky spectrum ",
    "mainly zodiacal emission  in the adjacent subslit .",
    "we computed the median sky and subtracted it from the low - resolution frames .",
    "further processing was done within the _ irs _ data reduction and analysis package _",
    ", version v.4 @xcite  a powerful idl package for spectral extraction and spectral analysis .",
    "the high - resolution spectra were extracted with  full aperture \" extraction along the diffraction orders .",
    "the ends of each orders where the noise increases significantly were manually clipped . within any one module the individual orders matched remarkably well and required no further fine - tuning , with the exception of sh order 11 which was scaled up by 5% . finally the two nod positions were averaged .",
    "the low - resolution spectra were extracted using _ smart _ s `` interactive column extraction '' , which is similar to the method used in the ssc pipeline . the 3rd `` bonus '' order in sl and ll has not been included .    at the current stage of calibration , there remains a significant mismatch between some modules in both low- and high - resolution spectra .",
    "this mismatch is most likely due to either _",
    "( i ) _ extended source emission ( as seen e.g. by @xcite ) , or _",
    "( ii ) _ pointing errors that lead to flux losses that are most significant at short wavelengths ( narrow slits ) .",
    "we also note that the low - resolution slits are narrower than the slits of the high - resolution modules . at this early stage of the spitzer mission",
    "we have no means to identify the real cause .",
    "however , the lh and ll spectra agree very well with each other , and a comparison between the _ iras _ @xmath26 m flux of 3.15  jy @xcite and the ll flux in the _ iras _ filterband of 2.61",
    "jy yields good agreement , taking into account that the _ iras _ `` aperture '' is much bigger and is even more susceptible to extended emission . adopting the lh flux densities as correct",
    ", we scaled sh up by 36% to achieve an excellent match of the continuum fluxes around @xmath27 m .",
    "we note that the flux in the [ siii ] line , which lies in the overlap region between sh and lh , is then the same in both modules .",
    "similarly , the low - resolution spectra from different modules had to be scaled to match .",
    "the ll 2nd order was scaled up by 17% to match the ll 1st order ; the sl 2nd order was scaled up by 40% to match the sl 1st order ; and finally the resulting sl spectrum was scaled up by 17% to match the ll spectrum . as a result of this approach the low- and high resolution spectra agree very well with each other , and  even more important  we determine from the low - resolution spectrum in the _ iras _ @xmath28 m band a total flux of 0.47  jy , while @xcite found 0.56  jy from _ iras _  again good agreement ! figures  [ fighires ] and [ figlores ] show the final _ irs _ high- and low - resolution spectra , respectively .    the properties of the ionic and molecular features were obtained from single gaussian fits to the high- and low- resolution spectra within _ smart _ ; the results are listed in tables  [ tabfine ] and  [ tabpah ] .",
    "based on optical and near - ir spectroscopy @xcite , the _ isocam _ filter band ratios and pah emission features @xcite , it has long been argued that the nucleus of ngc7714 is a site of intense starburst activity .",
    "however , given its low extinction , the unusually high infrared luminosity and recent reports of a possible , hidden agn @xcite more precise diagnostics are needed to understand the processes in the nuclear region . the high signal - to - noise mid - ir _ irs _",
    "spectra provide the ideal diagnostic tools to characterize the nature of the underlying power source in more detail .",
    "table  [ tabfine ] lists the properties of the strongest fine - structure lines in the high - resolution spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fighires ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath29w@xmath30 for the [ neii ] line while @xcite found @xmath31w@xmath30 from the ground .",
    "for the [ s iv ] line we determine @xmath32w@xmath30 while @xcite quote @xmath33w@xmath30 based on _ isophot - s _ low - resolution spectra .",
    "the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , and s(2 ) lines of molecular hydrogen are marginally detected and will be discussed in a subsequent paper .    of particular interest is the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio as it is a good measure of the hardness of the interstellar radiation field , which is mainly determined by the most massive stars .",
    "we find [ neiii]/[ne ii]=@xmath34 , corresponding to an effective temperature of about @xmath35k @xcite .",
    "based on the `` _ iso - sws _ starburst sample '' , @xcite studied the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio for 27 galaxies , with values ranging from 0.05 ( m83 ) to 12.0 ( iizw40 ) , and a median value of 0.26 .",
    "the starbursts of the nearby iso sample with [ ne iii]/[neii ] ratios closest to our value are ngc3690 ( 0.71 ) and the interaction region in ngc4038/39 ( 0.84 ) .",
    "the origin of these variations is still controversial ( rigby & rieke 2004 , thornley et al .",
    "2000 ) . even within the same galaxy the [ ne iii]/[neii ]",
    "ratio can vary significantly as recently seen with the _ irs _ in ngc253 @xcite .",
    "we will address this important issue in a subsequent paper once we have observed a larger sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "however , with its large number of very luminous wolf - rayet stars , it is not surprising that the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio in ngc7714 lies above the value found in most starburst galaxies .",

    "we also find a marginal detection of the [ oiv ] line with @xmath42w@xmath30 .",
    "since the location of the line coincides with a noisy pixel , we take this value as an upper limit . hence , with [ oiv]/[neii ]  @xmath43 and a relative pah(@xmath44m)/continuum(@xmath44 m )  @xmath45 , ngc7714 falls below the region occupied by ulirgs in fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the absence of the [ nev ] line  we place a @xmath46 upper limit of @xmath47w@xmath30  emphasizes the pure starburst nature of ngc7714 . on the basis of the infrared emission lines , therefore",
    ", we find no evidence for an obscured ionized region associated with an agn , which implies that the variable x - ray source reported by @xcite is either from strong shocks associated with very recent supernova activity , or emission from a hmxb .",
    "there is growing evidence that both possibilities are intimately associated with massive young star clusters @xcite .",

    "some of those features have also been seen in the _ isophot - s _ spectra which covered the @xmath61 m range at a resolution of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the total flux we determine for the strongest feature at @xmath44 m agrees with the _ isophot - s _ measurement of @xmath63w@xmath30 .",
    "shortward of @xmath54 m the spectrum is qualitatively very similar to the well - know starburst galaxy m82 . however , unlike m82 , which has very strong pah emission with respect to the warm continuum from very small grains and plausibly some extinction due to silicates at @xmath64 m @xcite , the spectrum of ngc7714 shows a rather smooth continuum and no evidence for silicate absorption .    with the high signal - to - noise provided by _ spitzer - irs _ it now becomes possible to expand the comprehensive study of fainter pah features seen in galactic sources to a large sample of extragalactic sources .",
    "while the strength of e.g. the @xmath55 m pah / continuum ratio is remarkably constant over a wide luminosity range in galactic sources , others , e.g. the @xmath57 m feature , which is linked to neutral pahs , get quickly reduced in stronger ionizing radiation fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the @xmath58 m band correlates well with the cc stretch mode at @xmath55 m for galactic sources ranging from ysos , hii regions , and reflection nebulae to planetary nebulae ( their fig .  5 ) .",
    "with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , ngc7714 falls right on their correlation line .",
    "we conclude that the physical conditions in ngc7714 are similar to galactic hii regions .",
    "in fact , a comparison with the _ iso - sws _ spectrum of m17 @xcite yields a perfect overall match longward of @xmath67 m .",
    "one of the most remarkable attributes in figure  [ figlores ] is the lack of silicate absorption in ngc7714 .",
    "this implies that the observed spectral shape of the mid - ir continuum is defined purely by the continuum emission of the hottest dust directly heated by the young , massive stars .",
    "if so then ngc7714 might be a well - needed template for fitting relatively unobscured starbursts at low and high redshifts .",
    "is ngc7714 the perfect , unobscured starburst ?    from the hydrogen recombination lines pa@xmath17 , br@xmath11 , and br@xmath68 , @xcite determined @xmath69  mag for a point source model with obscuring screen , and @xmath70  mag if sources and dust are homogeneously mixed . for an extinction law of @xmath71 and if @xmath72 we find that @xmath73 and hence the continuum around @xmath74 m would be suppressed by a factor of at most 30% . in the case of an obscuring screen , which was favored by @xcite ,",
    "the suppression is only 15% , which is in good agreement with the shape of our spectrum .",
    "the long wavelength baseline available in our spectrum of ngc7714 makes possible a very accurate determination of the continuum , which allows sophisticated fits for the dust emission which is responsible for this continuum .",
    "figure  [ figbbfit ] shows a three component fit to the low - resolution spectrum .",
    "two components are warm and cool astronomical silicate / graphite ( si / gr ) dust with an mrn distribution @xcite and the optical constants given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the third component is astronomical pahs for which we use the absorption coefficient of @xcite .",
    "we also allowed for the possibility of an intervening , absorbing si / gr dust screen but found that @xmath75 ( consistent with the above results ) .",
    "the si / gr dust components have temperatures of approximately 153k and 60k , and the pah component has a temperature of about 340k .",
    "pah emission clearly dominates below @xmath76 m while the si / gr mix fills in the `` pah trough '' at @xmath77 m .",
    "the si / gr component then dominates at longer wavelengths . a warm and a hot component",
    "are clearly present in ngc7714 . due to the absence of silicate absorption",
    ", we have confidence that the continuum is directly observed , without being obscured by cooler , intervening dust .",
    "this means that we have achieved a direct measurement of the hottest dust in a prototypical galaxy .",
    "this determination is important because the dust temperature is often used as a discriminant between starbursts and agn .",
    "this work is based [ in part ] on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
