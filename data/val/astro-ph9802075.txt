    "the galactic globular clusters ( gc ) constitute the fossil record of the galaxy formation epoch ; their ages therefore provide fundamental informations about the timescale of the formation process , and put strong constraints on the age of the universe .    in two recent papers ( salaris , deglinnocenti & weiss 1997 ; salaris & weiss 1997 ; papers i & ii ) we have redetermined ages for a sample of gcs by means of new stellar models employing the latest improvements in stellar input physics , noticeably in equation of state and opacities . in paper",
    "i we demonstrated that the age of three extremely metal - poor clusters is around 12 gyr due to the model improvements . in paper",
    "ii the same models were applied to a sample of 25 halo clusters .",
    "we put special emphasis on the careful application of two distance and reddening - independent methods for determining absolute and relative ages within groups of clusters of comparable metallicity .",
    "not only did we confirm the new , low value for the age of the oldest clusters , but also found a clear correlation between age and metallicity of the halo clusters .",
    "the lowest age in our sample amounted to only 6.5 gyr for ter  7 , which , however , might not be one of the typical halo clusters ( see the discussion in paper ii ) , for which the lowest age was 8 gyr .",
    "we emphasize that our predicted distances were in agreement with the first hipparcos - based distance determinations .",
    "several aspects of our results confirmed those of other papers ( chaboyer & kim 1995 ; mazzitelli , dantona & caloi 1995 ) or have been confirmed in the following ( sarajedini , chaboyer & demarque 1997 ) .    since the lowest ages for typical halo clusters were comparable to those of disk white dwarfs ( salaris et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is interesting to ask how _ disk _",
    "gc ( see , e.g. , armandroff 1989 for a study about the kinematical properties of this gc system ) fit into the emerging picture of the history of galaxy formation . to determine their ages we have used the same rigorous approach we have been using successfully for the halo clusters .",
    "we selected three _ disk _",
    "clusters , namely 47  tuc , m71 and ngc6352 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 photometry extending well below the turn - off ( to ) point , and with almost the same metallicity ( [ fe / h]=-0.70 for 47  tuc and m71 , [ fe / h]=-0.64 for ngc6352 according to carretta & gratton 1997 ) . in the case of 47  tuc and ngc6352 the absolute age",
    "is directly determined by means of the difference between the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) level and the to , the so - called @xmath3 age indicator ( or _ vertical method _ ) , while for m71 , whose photometry shows a poorly populated hb , the relative age with respect to 47  tuc is determined by means of the colour difference between the to and the base of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the so - called @xmath4 age indicator ( or _ horizontal method _ ) .    due to the high metallicity of the _ disk _ clusters , additional stellar evolution calculations became necessary .",
    "the computational details as well as the age determination method will be presented briefly in sect .  2 .",
    "the application of our isochrones to the three clusters will then be discussed in detail in sect .",
    "3 . after that",
    ", we will revisit our halo cluster sample , which we extended by another three objects .",
    "due to new results about the metallicity scale of globular clusters ( carretta & gratton 1997 ) , a re - evaluation of their ages became necessary .",
    "the updated results are contained in sect .",
    "4 . in the final section",
    "we will discuss all results .",
    "for the details of the stellar evolution computations we refer the reader to papers i and ii . suffice to repeat here the most important aspects of the physical input for the evolutionary tracks and isochrones .",
    "we have used the opal eos ( rogers , swenson & iglesias 1996 ) supplemented for the regions where the opal eos is not available , with the eos described in paper i.      for the relative abundances of the elements heavier than helium we use an @xmath0-enhanced heavy elements mixture ( table  [ t : ae ] ) selected according to the results presented by ryan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) about chemical abundances in metal - poor field stars .",
    "these abundance ratios are also consistent with the results summarized in wheeler et al .",

    "mcwilliam ( 1997 ) has reported @xmath0-element enhancements for metal - poor field stars derived from different authors ; these overabundances are again in broad agreement with the heavy elements mixture we adopted .",
    "note , however , that the error - bars in these determinations are so large that a constant enhancement value for all @xmath0-elements can not be excluded definitely .",
    "ti is the only element for which our selected enhancement ( in agreement with the ryan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) results for the lowest metallicities ) does not agree well with the results of other investigations .",
    "nevertheless , this is only of minor concern , since ti affects appreciably only the opacities through the tio molecule , but in a temperature region that does not affect the evolution of the stellar models computed for producing our isochrones ( see , e.g. , the discussion on alexander & ferguson 1994 ) .",

    "equivalent tables for mixtures with solar metal ratios were used for scaled - solar ischrones .      a value of 1.80 for the mixing length parameter has been adopted ; this value satisfies the solar constraint and at the same time reproduces well the rgb of a selected sample of gc in the ( @xmath5 ) plane , as derived by frogel et al .",

    "the conversion of @xmath6 and @xmath7 into ( @xmath8)-magnitudes and colours is performed by adopting a combination of buser & kurucz ( 1978 - bk78 ) and buser & kurucz ( 1992 - bk92 ) transformations ( see paper i ) . since in this paper",
    "we want also to compare the gc distance moduli obtained from our zahb models with the distance scale set by the hipparcos subdwarfs , we have devoted particular care to the calibration of the zero point of the bolometric correction scale .",
    "the bk78 and bk92 bolometric corrections ( bc ) are normalized such that the maximum value of the bc is zero ( see bk78 ) , all others being negative .",
    "this bc scale has to be calibrated later in such a way as to reproduce observed v magnitudes of selected stars ( as discussed in bk78 and bk92 ) . to this purpose",
    "we have used the recent empirical bc determinations by alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) for main sequence ( ms ) stars of low to solar metallicity . with a constant shift applied , our bc can reproduce these empirical results for all the metallicities considered in this paper within @xmath90.02 mag . the alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) bc are on a scale where @xmath10=-0.12 ; we therefore adopted @xmath11=4.70 in order to be consistent with the observed solar v brightness ( @xmath12=4.82@xmath130.02 according to hayes 1985 ) .",
    "with respect to paper i and ii , where the zero point of our bc was calibrated according to the old empirical bc scale for hot ms stars ( @xmath14 k ) of nearly solar metallicity by code et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , our isochrones in the @xmath1-@xmath15 plane are now 0.06 mag brighter .",
    "we think that the present recalibration is more reliable since we are using new empirical bc for stars with the same metallicity and the same range of @xmath7 as for gc stars , a fact that minimizes possible differential errors in the theoretical bc varying with metallicity and @xmath7 .",
    "of course , the zero point of the adopted bc scale does not influence at all the absolute and relative ages obtained by means of the vertical and horizontal methods used here and in paper i and ii . however , it is important for the _ a posteriori _ calculations of the distances .",
    "in addition to the metallicities specified in paper ii we added consistent calculations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath18}=-0.7 $ ] and @xmath19 dex .",
    "the helium content at these metallicities was either @xmath20 , which is identical to that for the mixture with @xmath21 ( the most metal - rich one used in paper  ii ) , or respectively @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtained when using @xmath24 as in paper  ii , or @xmath25 , which is close to the initial solar helium abundance as derived from the computation of solar models ( see e.g.  schlattl et al .",
    "for some @xmath26-combinations evolutionary calculations for scaled - solar metal abundances were added for comparison ( see sect .",
    "3.4 ) . with these new calculations our set of @xmath0-enhanced isochrones spans the [ fe / h ] range -2.3@xmath27[fe / h]@xmath27 - 0.6 .      as already mentioned in the introduction , to determine directly the absolute age of the clusters we use the _ vertical method _",
    "( see stetson et al .",
    "1996 for a review and paper i ) , which makes use of the age - dependent brightness difference between to and zahb .",
    "this method is reliable when the cluster photometry shows a well - populated hb ; in this case the zahb level corresponds to the lower envelope of the stellar distribution along the hb , and it is determined by means of a statistical method discussed in paper ii .",
    "when it is not possible to apply the _ vertical method _ , relative ages between clusters of comparable metallicity are determined by the _ horizontal method _ , which uses the age - dependent colour difference between to and the base of the rgb ( see vandenberg et al .  1990 ) .",
    "after the age has been determined , we check our results with various tests : ( i ) we verify that the corresponding isochrone fits the cluster cmd sufficiently well ; ( ii ) we compare our predicted reddening ( obtained from fitting the unevolved isochrone main sequence to the observed one ) with literature values ; ( iii ) we use the theoretical zahb brightness to derive the distance modulus of the cluster , and compare this with independent determinations .",
    "the most prominent disk cluster is certainly 47  tuc on the southern hemisphere .",

    "1987 ) with several sets of theoretical isochrones , after deriving the distance to the cluster by means of the main sequence ( ms ) fitting using hipparcos subdwarfs ; they got ages in the range 9.6 - 10.8 gyr , with a random error of 12% on the single age values .",
    "there have been several suggestions that the helium content of 47  tuc stars is close to the solar value .",
    "alonso et al .  ( 1997 ) find that @xmath29 is almost the same in ngc6366 ( a metal - rich halo cluster , with a metallicity close to that of 47 tuc , see table  [ t : hc ] ) and 47  tuc , implying the same age for both clusters ; however , @xmath30 is definitely larger for 47  tuc , thus indicating that this cluster has to be younger than ngc6366 .",
    "this means that two age indicators give contradicting results . since @xmath30 is largely independent of the helium content while @xmath29 is dependent ( as shown by salaris et al .",
    "1994 and confirmed by our computations ) , they take this as evidence for an enriched helium content in 47  tuc with respect to ngc6366 , concluding that a value y=0.27 - 0.28 for 47  tuc could explain this discrepancy .",

    "1983 ) . since the ms is shifted at lower luminosities and the zahb at higher ones for an increase of the initial helium abundance in stellar models , the difference @xmath37 results to be a good indicator of the stellar initial helium content , that complements the r - parameter .    from our definition of @xmath37",
    "it turns out that this indicator can only be used in clusters with deep ms photometry , an hb redder than the to and a well - defined reddening to allow for a precise identification of the corresponding point on the theoretical isochrone ; all three conditions are fulfilled for 47  tuc ( @xmath38 ; zinn 1980 ) .",

    "consequently , we have used isochrones with solar helium content to determine the age of 47  tuc .",
    "due to the very well - populated red hb , the identification of the zahb level is very easy and unambiguous ; applying the method devised in paper ii we derive @xmath45 .",
    "the to - brightness is more difficult to determine , since ( as already noted by grundahl 1996 ) not many stars populate this region of the colour - magnitude diagram provided by hesser et al .",

    "this effect has not been taken into account in paper  ii , but it was estimated that ages should be affected by less than the typical errors in our ages ( @xmath136 gyr as 12 @xmath137 error ) . for completeness , however , we repeated the analysis of paper  ii for the present paper .",
    "the new results are shown in table  [ t : hc ] . in the case of arp2 and rup106",
    "we determined the metallicity reported in table  [ t : hc ] recalibrating on the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) scale the rgb morphological metallicity indicators used for determining the metallicities given in paper  ii .",
    "in addition to the 25 clusters of paper  ii , we have added three other halo clusters : ngc5897 ( sarajedini 1992 ) and ngc6101 ( sarajedini & da costa 1991 ) , both intermediate metal - poor clusters , and ngc1261 ( bolte & marleau 1989 ) , an intermediate metal - rich cluster .",
    "note that the cluster ngc3201 moved one metallicity group upwards .",
    "interestingly , since this cluster allows the application of the vertical method , we used it for checking the consistency of ages in the intermediate metal - poor group in paper  ii , while we can do the same test now for the intermediate metal - rich group . in both cases , the relative age of ngc3201 with respect to the template cluster in the same metallicity group as derived from the horizontal method is consistent with its absolute age as derived from the vertical method . on average ,",
    "absolute cluster ages are , compared to paper  i , reduced by @xmath138 gyr due to the increased metallicity .    in table",
    "[ t : hc ] , last two columns , we have listed direct determinations of distance modulus and reddening for the reference clusters ( see sect .",
    "2.7 ) , and indicative reddenings for all others .",
    "the latter have been estimated by means of the following procedure : once the age has been determined by the horizontal method , the absolute colour of the to is known from the theoretical isochrones .",
    "comparison with the observed to then gives the reddening ( the errors associated with this procedure , due to the error on the cluster ages , are of the order of @xmath130.02 mag ) . from the theoretical to one",
    "could also obtain a distance by comparing it with the observed apparent to - magnitude .",
    "since this , however , is very uncertain in some cases ( see the discussion about m15 in paper  i ) , we did not list them .",
    "the reader may derive estimates for the distances by employing our eq .  1 ( see below )",
    ".    there has been some concern that a few clusters  rup106 and pal12 in our sample  do not show @xmath0-element enrichment ( brown et al.1997 ) .",
    "although these are preliminary results based on only two stars in each cluster , and still have to be confirmed , we have investigated by how much the ages would be changed , mainly due to the reduced total metallicity . in table",
    "[ t : hc ] we have therefore added ages for both clusters based on this assumption . to obtain them , we determined the absolute age of the reference cluster in their group ( namely , m68 and m5 ) from the vertical method by means of appropriately scaled - solar isochrones ( thus assuming for the reference clusters [ @xmath0/fe]=0 , too ) and then we derived the differential age of rup106 and pal12 with respect to m68 and m5 by means of the horizontal method ( using the same set of scaled - solar isochrones ) .",
    "the net effect amounts to an age increase by , respectively , 0.8 gyr and 1.1 gyr .",
    "we note that the scaled - solar isochrone used for pal12 fits better to the observed rgb than the one including @xmath0-element enhancement . this might be taken as independent , theoretical support for the claim that this cluster does not show enriched @xmath0-elements .",
    "as emphasized already in papers i and ii , our method to determine cluster ages is independent of any distance determination .",
    "rather , the vertical method , which we use for the absolute age of the reference clusters , together with the theoretical models , allows to predict a cluster distance .",
    "this predicted value can then be compared with other distance determinations to check for the reliability of our models .    in paper",
    "i , we have shown that we are in agreement with some of the relations relating absolute rr  lyrae brightness with metallicity . in paper  ii , this point was further emphasized , but since the very first hipparcos - parallaxes had become available , we also compared with results relevant for cluster distances .",
    "again , we found that we were consistent with these results , though some of them were in conflict with each other .",
    "since then , a number of papers have appeared , which are devoted to the question of gc distances obtained from the fitting of their ms to subdwarfs , whose distances can be determined by hipparcos - parallaxes ( reid 1997 , 1998 ; gratton et al .  1997 ; chaboyer et al .",
    "1997 ; pont et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these papers , different samples of subdwarfs (",
    "sometimes including also objects with only ground - based parallaxes ) , different bias corrections , different metallicities for the same subdwarfs or globular clusters have been used , and the results do not agree in all cases ( e.g.  the case of m92 : reid 1997 , pont et al .",
    "1998 and gratton et al .  1997 ) .    for our reference clusters ( see table  [ t : hc ] ) we found hipparcos - parallaxes based distance determinations ( in the following for simplicity called `` hipparcos - distances '' ) for m68 ( reid 1997 ; gratton et al .  1997 ) , m5 ( reid 1997 ; gratton et al .",
    "1997 ; chaboyer et al .",
    "1997 ) , and 47  tuc ( gratton et al .  1997 , reid 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , we can also compare our theoretical @xmath71(zahb)-[fe / h ] relation ( taken at the average temperature of the rr lyrae instability strip , @xmath139@xmath673.85 ) with the observational one derived by gratton et al .",

    "the error bars for our zahb distances take into account the error on the observational zahb location ( as given in paper i ) and the small contribution due to an uncertainty by @xmath130.10 dex in the cluster metallicity . from gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we adopted the binary corrected distance moduli reported in column 8 of their table 3 , while from reid ( 1997 ) we have taken the distance moduli reported in column 7 of his table 3 ( derived by selecting the subsample of subdwarfs with the most accurate parallax ) for m5 .",
    "in the case of m68 , due to the paucity of metal poor subdwarfs considered by reid ( 1997 ) , we report his result given in column 9 of the same table ( all subdwarfs shifted to a monometallicity sequence corresponding to the metallicity of m68 ) .",
    "since reid ( 1997 ) gives results for different reddening estimates , we could select distances for those reddenings equal ( or as close as possible ) to the one obtained from our isochrones .    for m68 and m5",
    "our distances are in very good agreement with gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , reid ( 1997 ) and chaboyer et al .",
    "the agreement in the case of m5 ( that is the cluster with the best available photometry ) is impressive .",
    "one should note that the reddening and cluster metallicity in these papers differ slightly from ours in some cases . both affect the distance determination by ms fitting , while our distance modulus is independent of the reddening , as long as the uncertainty is of the order of some hundredths of magnitude .",
    "however , the differences in reddening are always @xmath150 mag , and those in metallicity @xmath151 dex , such that the results of the comparison are not modified appreciably .",
    "a slightly different result is found in the case of 47  tuc , for which one notes less consistency between our distance modulus and that by gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and reid ( 1998 ) , although the distances are still compatible within the respective errors bars .",
    "part of the difference can be explained by the fact that in the quoted papers solar - scaled isochrones were used ( see also the discussion at the end of sect .",
    "gratton et al .  ( 1997 ) also provide the following empirical relation between zahb brightness at the rr lyrae instability strip and metallicity , based on the distances they obtained by means of the ms fitting technique applied to their sample of 9 clusters ,    @xmath152 - 1.5 ) + ( 0.49\\pm0.04)\\,\\,\\,\\,(1)\\ ] ]    from our theoretical models ( considering the case with @xmath153 ) we derive , at @xmath7=3.85 :    @xmath154 - 1.5 ) + 0.52 \\,\\,\\,\\,(2)\\ ] ]    in very good agreement with the empirical relation ( eq .  1 )",
    ".    we can therefore conclude ( as we did in paper  ii ) that our models predict distances completely confirmed by independent , hipparcos - based methods . for completeness",
    "we add that our distance moduli as compared to paper  ii changed due to two reasons : firstly , we use higher metallicities , which lower the distance modulus ; secondly , the new calibration of the bolometric correction scale increases it again .",
    "the net result is only a very small change .",

    "col ]    before closing this section we briefly want to show the result of yet another comparison between hipparcos - based results and our theoretical models . in this case we compare the @xmath15 colours of our isochrones at @xmath155=6.0 with the observed subdwarfs colour at the same absolute magnitude , as derived by gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for a sample of 13 single and unevolved ms stars .",
    "the result of this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : col ] , where empirical data ( symbols ) are compared with the corresponding quantity from our theoretical isochrones ( solid line ) .",
    "the agreement between the colours of our isochrones and the subdwarfs is very good at all metallcities .",
    "the original motivation for paper  i had been to resolve the apparent `` age discrepancy '' between globular clusters and the expanding universe . as we have demonstrated in all our papers , the oldest globular clusters appear to be younger than 12 gyr , possibly only as old as 11 gyr .",
    "note that the neglect of diffusion even leads to a slight overestimation of the ages by approximately 0.8 gyr ( cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ) for the vertical method ( but the relative ages derived by means of the horizontal method are unchanged ) .",
    "such a cluster age is completely consistent with the general range of recent @xmath156-determinations ( see freedman 1997 for a review ) , which extends from below 50 to 80 km / s / mpc .",
    "salaris & cassisi ( 1998 ) used theoretical stellar models calculated with the same stellar evolution program to predict the brightness of the tip of the rgb ( their tip bolometric luminosities are in complete agreement with our models ) , which can be used as a primary distance indicator . applying this to the galaxy ngc3379 in the leo  i group , the distance to the coma cluster ( obtained from the relative distance coma - leo i as derived from different secondary distance indicators )",
    "then gives a hubble constant @xmath157 km / s / mpc .",
    "depending on the cosmological model , the age of the universe is marginally or completely consistent with our oldest clusters . since an open universe with @xmath158 and @xmath159 appears to be preferred ( the probably most important single evidence coming from the statistics of giant arcs produced by cluster of galaxies ; see bartelmann et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath160 implies an age of @xmath6713 gyr . therefore distance indicator and cluster age result in a completely consistent picture .",
    "the second purpose of our age determinations is to establish a reliable age - metallicity relation for galactic globular clusters . from fig .",
    "[ f : afe ] the general scenario of paper  ii is confirmed and extended : it appears that the more metal - poor clusters formed between 11 and 12 gyr ago within a timespan of less than 1 gyr .",
    "after that halo clusters continued to be formed at higher metallicity for about 4 gyr , with a tendency for more metal - rich clusters to form later ( with the exception of ngc6366 , but see the discussion in paper ii about this cluster ) .",
    "the halo cluster creation continued even after the disk had already been formed , as it is evident from the ages of the oldest disk white dwarfs ( salaris et al .",
    "1997 ; leggett et al .",
    "1997 ) , which are around 9 gyr old . in the present paper",
    ", we found that the three disk clusters investigated are coeval with these disk white dwarfs .",
    "this is an important result , because previous age estimates ( e.g.chaboyer & kim ) placed disk clusters at the same age as our oldest halo clusters and let them appear to be considerably older than the disk white dwarfs .",
    "in addition , for all metallicities there are clusters ( e.g.  rup106 & arp2 ) that appear to have been created at a later time , probably due to tidal interactions with dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( namely the sagittarius dsph ) or the magellanic clouds .",
    "such events are consistent with the finding that cluster formation in the lmc apparently has been triggered by close encounters with the galaxy ( girardi et al .  1995 ;",
    "fujimoto & kumai 1997 ) .",
    "with respect to the age - galactocentric distance relation ( fig .",
    "[ f : adi ] ) , our conclusion of paper  ii is supported : within the innermost 10 kpc an age spread of only @xmath161 gyr exists , if one neglects the exceptional clusters ngc6652 and ngc6366 ; the mean being at @xmath6711 gyr .",
    "the three disk clusters fit into this range at the lower boundary . at larger distances ,",
    "the age differences approach @xmath74 gyr , with the mean age being somewhat smaller .",
    "we agree with the conclusion of sarajedini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in that there appears to be a tendency that the innermost parts of the galactic halo formed within a timespan shorter than that for the outermost regions . however , we find the age spreads to differ only by a factor of two , and given the small number of clusters , it is not clear whether this is significant enough .",
    "in particular , the larger spread for the outer halo clusters again depends on a few clusters .",
    "one of these is pal12 , for which there are indications ( brown et al .",
    "1997 ) that it is not @xmath0-enhanced .",
    "if true , its age would be raised by @xmath162 gyr ( sect .",
    "4.1 ) , making both the intermediate metal - rich group and the outer halo clusters more homogeneous in age .",
    "another cluster with uncertain @xmath0-enhancement is rup106 .",
    "the disk clusters are different from the halo clusters with respect to their composition .",
    "we have found strong evidence that they have a solar - like helium content , while there is no indication of this in the halo clusters of comparable metallicity .",
    "recalling that their metallicity is only half the solar one , this implies a different chemical enrichment history for them than for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we also showed that @xmath0-element enhancement has to be taken into account properly in all aspects of the theoretical calculations for total metallicities @xmath163 , in order to obtain reliable isochrones . if the @xmath0-elements are enhanced in such a way that the condition [ c+n+o+ne/ mg+si+s+ca+fe]@xmath670 is violated , a fact that is compatible with current available observations , and the isochrone colours have to be determined with high accuracy for all evolutionary stages , then the computation of @xmath0-enhanced isochrones is necessary even for the lowest metallicities .",

    "<S> new age determinations of the galactic disk globular clusters 47  tuc , m71 and ngc6352 have been performed with our up - to - date @xmath0-enhanced stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all three clusters are about 9.2 gyr old and therefore coeval with the oldest disk white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> several arguments are presented which indicate that the initial helium content of the stars populating these clusters is close to the solar one . </S>",
    "<S> we also revisit a total of 28 halo clusters , for which we use an updated [ fe / h ] scale . </S>",
    "<S> this new metallicity scale leads on average to an age reduction of around 0.8 gyr relative to our previous results . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the predicted cluster distances , which result from our dating method , with the most recent distances based on hipparcos parallaxes of local subdwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that for the most metal - rich clusters scaled - solar isochrones no longer can be used to replace @xmath0-enhanced ones at the same total metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of the presented age determinations are discussed in the context of the formation history of the galaxy . </S>"
