    "alfvn waves are frequently observed in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "as alfvn waves upwardly transport large amounts of photospheric kinetic energy @xcite , they are considered promising sources of coronal heating and acceleration of fast solar wind in coronal holes . in this framework ,",
    "rapid dissipation of alfvn waves should inject thermal energy into the corona and accelerate the solar wind via wave pressure @xcite .",
    "as the magnetic flux tubes expand in the coronal hole region , the nonlinearity of the alfvn waves become significantly large so that nonlinear interactions can initiate an energy cascade , playing a significant role in the dissipation process .",
    "nonlinear dissipation of alfvn waves can occur by two main candidate mechanisms : compressible and incompressible processes . in the first mechanism ,",
    "nonlinear coupling between alfvn and compressible waves initiate an energy cascade by steepening .",
    "unless they are monochromatic and circularly polarized , alfvn waves can generate acoustic waves via their magnetic pressure forces @xcite , which then steepen into shock waves .",
    "alfvn waves can also directly steepen to form fast ( switch - on ) shocks or rotational discontinuities @xcite .",
    "this steepening and mode conversion process are suggested to explain many solar phenomena such as spicule formation @xcite , coronal heating @xcite , and solar wind acceleration @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is alfvnic turbulence triggered by two bidirectional alfvn waves @xcite . due to nonuniform alfvn speed in coronal holes , alfvn waves generated by photospheric motion",
    "are linearly reflected @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction between the original anti - sunward and reflected sunward waves triggers alfvnic turbulence .",
    "this turbulence model is also suggested as a candidate for coronal heating and solar wind acceleration @xcite using a phenomenological turbulent dissipation mode @xcite . as shown in recent three - dimensional direct numerical simulations using a reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) approximation",
    ", alfvnic turbulence can heat both closed coronal loops @xcite and open coronal holes @xcite .    the amount of reflected wave energy flux is of critical importance in the alfvnic turbulence models .",
    "most studies on turbulence - driven coronal heating and solar wind acceleration have assumed locally incompressible @xcite or nearly incompressible @xcite plasma .",
    "however , alfvn waves can be reflected by nonlinear interactions with compressible waves .",
    "the best - known example of such nonlinear reflection is the decay instability @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite investigated a compressible heating / acceleration model and reported significant reflection of alfvn waves .",
    "therefore the role of compressibility in reflection triggering should not be discounted . to more",
    "realistically model the corona and solar wind , it is necessary to elucidate the elementary processes of alfvn wave reflection caused by nonlinear interactions with compressible modes .",
    "this problem has motivated the study in this paper .",
    "@xcite reported that solar wind fluctuations near earth s orbit are mainly composed of anti - sunward alfvn waves .",
    "later studies revealed that the ratio of sunward to anti - sunward alfvn wave energies increases with distance @xcite .",
    "this fact is against the fundamental process of alfvnic turbulence called dynamical alignment @xcite . to explain this trend , researchers have proposed theoretical models based on the compressible turbulence @xcite , linear reflection @xcite and decay instability @xcite .",
    "herein , we propose a new reflection process that explains this observational fact .",
    "this process is a combination of the wave steepening and the decay instability , that is , linear polarization and resultant steepening forms a new energy channel which never appears in the circular - polarization case .",

    "previous observations @xcite revealed that within a certain band ( typically with period between 1 min and 10 min ) , the energy spectrum of photospheric transverse motion approximates a red - noise spectrum . by setting the highest wavenumber of the initial fluctuation spectrum equal to one tenth of the nyquist wavenumber ,",
