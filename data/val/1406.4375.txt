    "the formation and evolution of galaxies and their relation with the environment , from the scale of the local group to superclusters , has been a major field of astronomical research in the past decade . the first laboratory for studying mechanisms of galactic formation and evolution and their dependence on the surrounding environment is represented by the milky way ( mw ) and its satellite galaxies .",
    "for nearby systems , indeed , accurate photometry can be obtained for individual members of the various stellar populations .",
    "several investigations have shown that the outer regions of the galactic halo do not have a smooth distribution of stars but appear quite `` clumpy '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "dating back to @xcite , it was suggested that the dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsphs ) of the galaxy and a number of its globular clusters ( gcs ) are distributed along planar alignments reflecting distinct orbital planes and usually interpreted as the result of the disruption of larger galaxies .",
    "the location of these systems has recently been claimed to define a vast polar structure ( vpos ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and a similar plane has been detected with very high significance in m31 @xcite .",
    "a very interesting example of these alignments is the so called fornax stream that should include both dsphs ( fornax , leo  i , leo  ii , sculptor and possibly sextans and phoenix ) and gcs ( pal  3 , pal  4 and pal  12 ) , as also discussed in @xcite .",
    "even if the measurements of the absolute proper motion of fornax @xcite , together with the shell structures identified by @xcite , already provided some circumstantial evidence , accurate observations of large fractions of the fornax orbit are still lacking .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , in the interaction of small satellites ( e.g. dsphs and gcs ) with the mw , tidally stripped material should form elongated tidal tails and spherical shells extending many scale radii beyond the tidal radius .",
    "evidence of tidal tails has been found in connection with several gcs , for example pal  14 and ngc1851 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , m15 , m30 , m53 , ngc5053 , ngc5466 @xcite pal  5 @xcite and also ngc5139 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* @xmath3  cen ) .",
    "this last cluster is of particular interest .",
    "it has been claimed to be the remnant of a tidally disrupted galaxy because of : i ) its internal chemical and age distribution with the presence of multiple stellar populations ; ii ) its similarity for mass and chemistry to m54 , the gc associated with the core of the disrupting sagittarius galaxy ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and iii ) its unusual low - inclination , retrograde orbit . even if simulations of the tidal disruption of @xmath3  cen suggested the presence of stripped cluster stars in the solar neighborhood , the observation of these extratidal stars only produced preliminary results ( see e.g. *",
    "* ) that were later found to be biased by substantial foreground differential reddening problems @xcite .",
    "subsequently @xcite estimated that only a very small fraction of cluster members in the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase were actually stripped stars .",
    "@xcite has recently reported the detection of `` tidal debris '' consistent with that modeled for @xmath3  cen .",
    "another interesting gc hosting multiple stellar populations is ngc6752 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the outer - halo sparse gc pal  12 is probably younger than the bulk of ggcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a tidal stream of debris from the sgr dsph galaxy towards the galactic halo has been observed both by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass * ? ? ? * ) and by the sdss @xcite and various authors have shown that pal  12 is embedded in this stream ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is characterized by an alt - azimuth mount with a f/5.5 modified ritchey - chr tien optics ( see * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "the telescope is equipped with omegacam @xcite , a camera with a field of view of @xmath5 x @xmath5 , built by a consortium of european institutes , featuring a 32-ccd , 16k x 16k detector mosaic , with a pixel size of 0.21 arcsec .",

    "these systems are located either along the fornax orbit or are of particular interest for the interaction mechanism with the galactic halo : fornax and sculptor ( 38 fields ) , phoenix ( 3 fields ) , sextans ( 13 fields ) , pal  3 ( 3 fields ) , pal  12 ( 1 field ) , @xmath3  cen and ngc6752 ( 33 and 32 fields around each gc , respectively ) . in fig .",

    "<S> strega ( structure and evolution of the galaxy ) is a guaranteed time survey being performed at the vst ( the eso vlt survey telescope ) to map about 150 square degrees in the galactic halo , in order to constrain the mechanisms of galactic formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is built as a five - year project , organized in two parts : a core program to explore the surrounding regions of selected stellar systems and a second complementary part to map the southern portion of the fornax orbit and extend the observations of the core program . </S>",
    "<S> the adopted stellar tracers are mainly variable stars ( rr  lyraes and long period variables ) and main sequence turn - off stars for which observations in the @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 bands are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we present an overview of the survey and some preliminary results for three observing runs that have been completed . </S>",
    "<S> for the region centered on @xmath3  cen ( 37 deg@xmath4 ) , covering about three tidal radii , we also discuss the detected stellar density radial profile and angular distribution , leading to the identification of extratidal cluster stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also conclude that the cluster tidal radius is about 1.2 deg , in agreement with values in the literature based on the wilson model .    </S>",
