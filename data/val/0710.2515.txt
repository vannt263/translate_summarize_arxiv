    "in our recent short paper @xcite we presented ( in a surprisingly simple form ) an exact 4-parametric family of static asymptotically flat solutions of electrovacuum einstein - maxwell equations which describes the equilibrium configurations of two ( nonrotating ) charged massess in general relativity . in this paper",
    "we present a more general , 5-parametric solution of these equations which represent a nonlinear superposition of fields of two reissner - nordstrm sources with arbitrary mass and charge parameters and arbitrarily chosen separating distance and describe the procedure for a construction of a superposition of these fields . in the subsequent sections , we use a special divergent form of the reduced einstein - maxwell equations to derive the komar - like integrals for the total gravitational mass and charge of this field and calculate the physical masses and charges of the sources defined as the additive inputs of each source in the total gravitational mass and total charge of the system .",
    "the expression of our solution in terms of these physical parameters simplifies it considerably .",
    "then we determine the constraint which should be imposed on the parameters of this superposition of fields to provide the absence in the remaining 4-parametric solution of any non - physical singularities such as the conical points on the axis outside the sources .",
    "_ this constraint plays the role of the condition for equilibrium of these sources in their common gravitational and electromagnetic fields . _    the 5-parametric solution , presented in this paper ,",
    "was constructed using the monodromy transform approach @xcite which give rise to a reformulation of the einstein - maxwell equations for stationary axisymmetric fields in terms of equivalent system of linear singular integral equations . as it is explained below , the functional parameters ( monodromy data ) in the kernels of these integral equations for our solution are chosen as analytically matched , rational functions of the spectral parameter .",
    "this choice of the monodromy data means that the solution possess _ rational axis data _ , i.e. that the values of all components of metric and electromagnetic potential , expressed in terms of cylindrical weyl coordinates @xmath0 , on the axis of simmetry @xmath1 are rational functions of @xmath2 .",
    "this means also that our solution virtually is the soliton solution on the minkowski background in the sense , that it consists of a pure soliton part and its analytical continuation in the space of parameters .",
    "different approaches to solution of integrable space - time symmetry reductions of the einstein s field equations , which began to develop about thirty years ago , gave rise to different formulations ( generally non - equivalent to each other ) of the integral equation methods , which allow to calculate the solutions of these field equations solving some systems of linear singular integral equations .",
    "the first reformulation of symmetry reduced einstein equations in terms of a system of linear singular integral equations for vacuum gravitational fields ( together with a construction of vacuum solitons ) was proposed in the framework of the _ inverse scattering approach _ @xcite .",
    "this construction was based on a formulation of equivalent riemann - hilbert problem for the @xmath3-matrix functions on the spectral plane which gave rise to some system of linear singular integral equations .",
    "it is important , that the solutions of this equations possess the character of _ solution generating transformations _ , because the matrix kernel of these integral equations includes , as functional parameters , the components of an arbitrarily chosen vacuum metric which serves as the background for solitons , while the generating solution itself can be considered as describing some nonlinear perturbation of this background .    in the framework of another ,",
    "_ group - theoretic approach _ , for construction of the solution generating transformations corresponding to the elements of the infinite dimensional algebra of internal symmetries of electrovacuum einstein - maxwell equations for stationary axisymmetric fields ( found by kinnersley and chitre @xcite ) , hauser and ernst @xcite reduced these equations to a homogeneous hilbert problem for @xmath4-matrix functions of an auxiliary complex parameter and then , to the corresponding @xmath4-matrix linear singular integral equations .",
    "this construction assumed an additional constraint imposed on the class of solutions , which means that only those solutions are considered which possess ( locally ) a regular behaviour of fields near the axis of symmetry .",
    "the integral equations @xcite have rather complicate matrix kernel which construction includes a calculation of matrix exponents of the elements of kinnersley and chitre algebra , represented by some algebraically defined holomorphic @xmath4-matrix functions of the mentioned above auxiliary complex parameter .",
    "later , fixing the choice of the seed solution by the simplest one , sibgatullin @xcite reduced the matrix integral equations @xcite of hauser and ernst to a simpler scalar linear singular integral equation with some `` normalization '' condition imposed additionally on its solutions .",
    "the kernel of this scalar integral equation was expressed explicitly in terms of the values of the ernst potentials on the axis of symmetry .",
    "this integral equation was actively used during the last one and a half decades by sibgatullin and others for mostly formal calculation of asymptotically flat solutions for various particular choices of ( asymptotically flat ) rational axis data for the ernst potentials .",
    "the _ monodromy transform approach_@xcite does not follow the ideology of the matrix riemann - hilbert problems , however , it is also based on some ideas of the modern theory of integrable systems , analytical theory of differential equations and the theory of linear singular integral equations . for physically different classes of vacuum and electrovacuum fields with two commuting isometries ( stationary axisymmetric fields , plane and cylindrical waves , inhomogeneous cosmological solutions and some others ) this approach suggests rather simple general construction of the coordinate - independent functional parameters ( called as monodromy data ) which characterize uniquely every local solution .",
    "the problem of constructing solutions for given monodromy data ( the inverse problem of the monodromy transform ) gave rise to a system of linear singular integral equations which differs essentially from the integral equations mentioned above .",
    "a specific structures of the ( scalar ) kernels of these integral equations and of the integration path on the spectral plane allow to describe all degrees of freedom of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields and make these integral equations _",
    "equivalent _ to the symmetry reduced einstein - maxwell equations . for stationary axisymmetric fields satisfying the regularity axis condition ,",
    "the integral equations @xcite simplify considerably . a general scheme for constructing of solutions with any _ rational analytically matched monodromy data _ ( or , equivalently , of solutions for any rational , not only asymptotically flat , axis data )",
    "was described earlier in detail ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "a discovery of existence of pure gravitational solitons and of the ways for their generating on arbitrarily chosen vacuum backgrounds  the dressing methods@xcite(see also @xcite ) , together with initiated by these results developments of the similar methods for einstein - maxwell fields@xcite , gave us a powerful tool for construction of a large variety of solutions of einstein s field equations and for nonlinear superposition of fields of certain kinds of sources with various external fields .",
    "on the other hand , later developments of the integral equation methods briefly described above suggested a simple idea to calculate the solutions of einstein and einstein - maxwell equations using these integral equations with the simplest choice of functional parameters ( the contour data , or the axis data for the ernst potentials , or analytically matched monodromy data ) in their kernels as rational functions of their arguments .",
    "this also leads to a construction of large families of exact solutions with arbitrary ( finitely large ) number of free parameters , but without any freedom in the choice of the background solution .",
    "this gives rise to the obvious questions concerning a comparison of these two constructions .",
    "first of all , it is clear , that the asymptotically flat rational - data solutions can be only a very special case of soliton solutions corresponding to a particular choice of the background for solitons .",
    "this can be the minkowski space - time or any other soliton solution on this background .",
    "indeed , a direct calculation shows , that vacuum solitons @xcite and electrovacuum solitons @xcite , both generated on the minkowski background , represent the asymptotically flat solutions with rational axis data .",
    "these solitons have as many of free parameters per one simple pole of the dressing matrix , as it is necessary to describe an arbitrary chosen rational asymptotically flat axis data with a twice lower number ( for vacuum case ) or with the same number of poles in this data .",
    "of course , the coincidence of the number of parameters itself does not mean that these classes of solutions coincide .",
    "moreover , some doubts in this coincidence can arise from that fact that the construction @xcite of electrovacuum solitons ( in contrast to vacuum soliton generating technique @xcite ) allows to generate the solitons with arbitrarily located complex poles of the dressing matrix and with the complex conjugated poles of the inverse matrix , while the solitons with real poles do not arise in this technique .",
    "of course , one can try to obtain the electrovacuum solitons with real poles as limiting cases of solitons with complex poles , however , this leads to solutions with coinciding real poles of dressing matrix and its inverse , which have less number of free parameters per each pole than the solitons with complex poles .",
    "to clarify this situation , it is worth to consider a one - soliton solution on the minkowski background , which coincides with the over - extreme part of the well known kerr - newman solution corresponding to a naked singularity .",
    "the under - extreme part of this solution , which has a horizon and corresponds to a black hole , can be described in terms of the soliton generating technique by a dressing matrix with one real pole . however , as it is well known , the under - extreme part of the kerr - newman family can be obtained by a simple analytical continuation from its over - extreme part in the space of its parameters .",
    "it is very likely , that the similar analytical continuation is possible not only for a one - soliton solution on the minkowski background , but for any number of solitons as well .",
    "indeed , solving the integral equations for the ( static ) two - pole monodromy data , we have found that the part of our static 5-parametric solution , which corresponds to a pair of naked reissner - nordstrm singularities , coincides with the static subfamily of two - soliton solutions on the minkowski background , while the remaining part of this family is connected with this two - soliton solution by the similar analytical continuations in the space of parameters as one uses in the one - soliton case to connect different parts of the kerr - newman family of solutions .",
    "the motivation given above shows that there is the most reason to expect that the class of solutions of the integral equations for asymptotically flat rational axis data consists of the already known solitons on the minkowski background together with their analytical continuations in the space of parameters ( which should be supplied also , for completeness , by certain limiting solutions corresponding to multiple poles in the dressing matrices ) .",
    "on the one hand , in view of the above considerations , this means that there is no any reason to consider every formally calculated solution of the integral equations for rational asymptotically flat axis data as some new one describing the `` extended '' or `` generalized '' solitons , because it would be curiously enough to call similarly the under - extreme part of the kerr - newman family of solutions which is a simple analytically continuation in the parameter space of its over - extreme part .    on the other hand",
    ", the above motivation does not mean at all , that there is no sense to use the integral equation methods for calculation of these soliton solutions starting directly from some asymptotically flat rational axis data .",
    "it is worth to mention here , that the application of the soliton generating technique leads to some specific parameterization of the constructing solutions which differs significantly from that which arise for the solutions constructed from the corresponding solutions of the integral equations .",
    "each of these parameterizations can occur to be more or less useful in different considerations of this class of soliton ( or rational - data ) solutions .",
    "for example , it seems , that just the existence of the analytical continuation in the parameter space discussed above can be proved for n - soliton solution more easily if we use its expression which arises from the solution of the integral equations , but considering the general twelve - parametric two - soliton solution , we find that it has the most compact form just in the soliton parameterization@xcite .",
    "this concludes our very brief reminding of some fragments of the history of the methods and of some interrelations between the solitons and solutions with rational axis data derived from the integral equation methods . at the end of this introduction",
    ", we sketch out the monodromy transform approach and the integral equation method which we use for construction of our 5-parametric solution for a superposition of fields of two reissner - nordstrm sources . in all",
    "necessary details , a theory of this method and a general scheme for construction of solutions with rational , analytically matched monodromy data , have been developed long ago and described in the papers cited above with some additional useful references therein .",
    "this approach is based a ) on the parametrization of the space of local solutions of the symmetry reduced einstein - maxwell equations by the monodromy data  a set of coordinate independent functions of a spectral parameter , which determine the branching properties on the spectral plane of the fundamental solution of associated linear system , and b ) on the reformulation of these equations in terms of a system of linear singular integral equations . for stationary axisymmetric fields ,",
    "this approach allows to construct nonlinear superpositions of electrovacuum fields of different sources characterized by analytically matched , rational monodromy data @xcite ( see also the appendix in @xcite ) . in the following sections , we demonstrate at first that the external field of a single reissner - nordstrm source is characterized just by this kind of the monodromy data functions which have on the spectral plane one simple pole and vanish at infinity .",
    "for superposition of fields of two such sources we choose the rational monodromy data functions as the sums of two poles with such coefficients which guarantee that the solution is static . given this monodromy data , we describe step by step the construction of the corresponding solution .      for electrovacuum einstein - maxwell fields depending only on two space - time coordinates , in the entire space of local solutions , which are analytical near some initial point and take at this point ( the point of `` normalization '' ) some `` standard '' values , every local solution with the metric @xmath5 and electromagnetic potential @xmath6 can be characterized uniquely by the monodromy data which consist of four coordinate - independent holomorphic functions of the spectral parameter @xmath7 : @xmath8 this monodromy data are defined as a complete set of independent functions which characterize the branching properties of the corresponding fundamental solution of the associated linear system on the spectral plane at its four singular points .",
    "this data are defined uniquely for any local solution and for arbitrary choice of these functions there always exists a unique local solution of electrovacuum einstein - maxwell equations with given monodromy data .",
    "this construction is useful as far as some effective methods can be developed for explicit constructing of local solutions for given monodromy data .",
    "then , given an explicit local solution , the corresponding global solution can be determined using its analytical continuation to other space - time regions where this solution may reveal also some regular behaviour or approaches various types of singularities .      the key point of the use of the monodromy data is the existence of some system of linear singular integral equations whose kernels and right hand sides are expressed algebraically in terms of the monodromy data and whose solution determines ( by means of some quadratures ) all components of metric and electromagnetic potential .    in general ,",
    "the structure of this system of linear singular integral equations is rather complicate .",
    "the singular integrals are defined on the contour @xmath9 on the spectral plane which consists of two disconnected parts @xmath10 .",
    "the locations of their endpoints depend on the space - time coordinates and coordinates of the initial point which enter also the integrands as parameters .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 goes from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and @xmath14 goes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , where , for example , for stationary axisymmetric fields in terms of weyl coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath18 , but for plane waves @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 correspond to the initial point .",
    "the monodromy data as well as the unknown functions in these integral equations are defined in two disconnected regions of the spectral plane  the neighbourhoods of @xmath11 and @xmath14 , where they are represented by pairs of functions ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) respectively .",
    "it is clear that these equations can not be solved for arbitrarily chosen monodromy data .",
    "however , for some classes of fields , such as , for example , stationary axisymmetric fields with a regular axis of symmetry considered in this paper , these integral equations can be simplified considerably and admit infinite hierarchies of multiparametric families of explicit solutions .      for stationary axisymmetric fields ,",
    "it is typical that physical and geometrical formulations of various problems ( as , for example , in the case of asymptotically flat fields ) imply that at least some part of the axis of symmetry is free of the field sources and therefore , a behaviour of metric and matter fields in the neighbourhood of this part of the axis should be regular . for such fields ,",
    "if we choose the initial point ( the point of normalization ) of a solution on such regular part of the axis , the initial points of the contours @xmath11 and @xmath14 coincide and instead of two disconnected contours we obtain one simple curve @xmath10 . changing preliminary the direction of integration on @xmath14 , we obtain one contour where the system of singular integral equations is defined .",
    "it starts at the point @xmath16 , goes through the initial point @xmath28 and ends at @xmath13 . on this contour the monodromy data and the unknown variable in the integral equations are represented by twice lower number of holomorphic functions because for these fields we have @xmath29 usually , we call these conditions as the regularity axis condition , however we note that these conditions guarantee only a regular local behaviour of fields near the axis , but they do not exclude the presence of some non - curvature singularities , such as conical points on the axis or closed time - like curves near it .",
    "thus , for stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum fields with a regular axis of symmetry the monodromy data are represented only by two arbitrary holomorphic functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we recall also that @xmath31 is `` responsible '' for a presence of electromagnetic field , so that for vacuum @xmath32 and the space of solutions of vacuum stationary axisymmetric fields near the regular part of the axis of symmetry is parameterized by the monodromy data consisting of one holomorphic function @xmath30 .",
    "another important property of the stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum fields with the regular axis of symmetry is that any solution can be characterized by the finite values of its metric components and potentials ( e.g. , of the complex ernst potentials @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) on the regular part of the axis of symmetry . in this case",
    ", the monodromy data ( [ matcheddata ] ) can be related to the values @xmath35 , @xmath36 on the axis : @xmath37 where @xmath2 is the weyl coordinate along the axis , @xmath38 is a coordinate of the initial point on this axis , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the `` normalized '' values of the ernst potentials at the initial point , for which we usually put @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the expressions ( [ axisdata ] ) allow us to relate the structure of the monodromy data ( [ matcheddata ] ) with some physical and geometrical properties of fields",
    ". in particular , for any asymptotically flat field @xmath30 and @xmath31 should be holomorphic at @xmath43 and @xmath44 moreover , in this case , the coefficients of expansions of these functions in the inverse powers of @xmath7 for @xmath45 can be simply related to the multipole moments of this asymptotically flat field .",
    "therefore , the multipole structure of the field can be determined in advance by the appropriate choice of the monodromy data .    for static fields , @xmath46 should be real , while @xmath47 should be real for pure electric fields and imaginary for pure magnetic fields and therefore , @xmath30 and @xmath31 should satisfy @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 and a bar means a complex conjugation .",
    "an infinite hierarchies of solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations can be calculated explicitly if we choose the analytically matched monodromy data ( [ matcheddata ] ) to be rational functions of the spectral parameter : @xmath51 where the functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are some polynomials . a general algorithm for solution of the integral equations for these polynomials of arbitrary orders",
    "was described in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm leads to explicit form of solutions in a unified , but rather complicate form , and , as we shall see below , a large careful work is necessary for finding of appropriate choice of physical parameters which can simplify significantly the constructed solutions .      for stationary axisymmetric fields outside their sources",
    "the metric and electromagnetic vector potential can be considered in cylindrical coordinates in the form @xmath55 a_i=\\{a_t,0,0,a_\\varphi\\ } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and the metric components @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 as well as the components @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the electromagnetic potential are functions of the coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath2 only .",
    "it is well known , that for the metric and electromagnetic fields ( [ lp - metric ] ) the symmetry reduced electrovacuum einstein - maxwell field equations decouple into two parts .",
    "one of these parts is a closed system of `` dynamical '' equations - the nonlinear partial differential equations for the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "( we recall here that the weyl cylindrical coordinates are defined so that @xmath64 and therefore , only two of these three metric components are unknown functions ) .",
    "another part is a pair of constraint equations which allow to determine in quadratures the conformal factor @xmath60 provided the solution for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is already known .",
    "though an explicit calculation of these quadratures for the conformal factor @xmath60 represent usually a large technical difficulty , the principal problem is a construction of the solution of the `` dynamical '' equations with wanted physical and geometrical properties .",
    "that is why we concentrate below mainly on the construction of solution of the `` dynamical '' equations .    in accordance with a general scheme @xcite",

    "we give the explicit expressions later , but now we concentrate on solving of the integral equations ( [ lines ] ) .    as it can be concluded from the structure of the singular integral equations , their solutions for the monodromy data ( [ one - pole ] ) should have the form @xmath111}(w),\\,\\ , \\bphi^{[\\mathbf{u}]}(w),\\,\\ , \\bphi^{[\\mathbf{v}]}(w)\\bigr\\ } = \\dfrac{(w-\\overline{h } ) } { p(w)}\\bigl\\ { w+x_0,\\,\\ , y_0,\\,\\ , z_0\\bigr\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are independent of the spectral parameter @xmath7 , but they can depend on the coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath2 .",

    "this allows us to express ( in accordance with ( [ bintegrals ] ) ) the total mass and charge of a system of sources in terms of the integrals over the surface @xmath282 surrounding the sources : @xmath298 now we transform the integrands in ( [ mtqt ] ) using the self - duality of @xmath299 and @xmath300 : @xmath301 \\displaystyle\\int\\limits_{b_s}{\\overset{\\hskip0.5ex + } { \\mathcal f}}{}^{ij}n_i n_j d^2\\sigma = i\\displaystyle\\int\\limits_{b_s}{\\overset{\\hskip0.5ex + } { \\mathcal f}}{}_{ij } k^i l^j d^2\\sigma \\end{array}\\qquad\\right\\vert\\qquad\\begin{array}{l } \\varepsilon^{ijkl } n_k n_l = k^i l^j - k^j l^i\\\\[2ex ] \\varepsilon^{ijkl } n_k n_l k_i l_j=1 \\end{array}\\ ] ] here we introduced two spatial unit vectors @xmath302 and @xmath303 which are orthogonal to each other and tangent to 2-surface @xmath282 .",
    "these vectors determine the orientation of the 2-surface @xmath282 so that the spatial basis @xmath304 is positively oriented . choosing the 2-surface @xmath282 to be axially",
    "symmetric , we specify the choice of the vectors @xmath302 and @xmath305 in the tangent space of @xmath282 so that @xmath305 would be the rotational killing vector @xmath306 and @xmath302 is tangent to a curve @xmath120 on @xmath282 with @xmath307 : @xmath308 where the parameter @xmath177 is the length on the curve @xmath120 and the direction on @xmath120 is chosen so that it goes from some point on the positive part of the @xmath2-axis to some point on its negative part ( provided the point @xmath309 is located somewhere inside @xmath282 ) .",
    "the element of the area on @xmath282 is @xmath310 .",
    "after the integration over @xmath144 we observe that the integrands of the remaining contour integrals over @xmath120 are the differentials of the @xmath144-components of the potentials of self - dual bivectors @xmath299 and @xmath300 : @xmath311\\\\[3ex ] e=\\dfrac { i}{2}\\displaystyle\\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{b_s}l}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi{}_\\varphi)d x^\\mu=-\\dfrac { i}{2}\\left[(\\phi_\\varphi)_+-(\\phi_\\varphi)_-\\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath312 means the value of a potential at the beginning of @xmath120 , i.e. on the positive part of the @xmath2-axis , and @xmath313  its value on the negative part of this axis .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath314 and @xmath315 are constant along the regular parts of the symmetry axis outside the sources and therefore , the integrals ( [ mtotalqtotal ] ) do not change if we deform the surface of integration @xmath282 surrounding the sources in the domain of regularity of the solution .",
    "now we consider the case , in which the source of the field consists of two parts ( black holes , naked singularities or extended bodies ) separated by some segment of the symmetry axis . in this case",
    ", we can deform the surface @xmath282 surrounding the sources into two spheres each surrounding one of these parts of the sources and a thin tube surrounding the intermediate part of the axis between the sources .",
    "if @xmath314 and @xmath315 are constant on the intermediate part of the axis , the integral over the thin tube vanish and we obtain that the integrals for the total mass and the total charge are expressed as the sums of the integrals of the same type over the spheres surrounding each of the sources . in particular , for the sources consisting of two parts , as it is in our solution for two reissner - nordstrm sources , we obtain @xmath316 where @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 , @xmath239 can be interpreted respectively as the masses ( energies ) and charges of the corresponding parts of the source . to conclude this section , we mention that rather tedious calculations show that the parameters @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 , @xmath239 in our electrostatic solution presented in the previous section and describing the field of two reissner - nordstrm sources , coincide with the values of the integrals ( [ mtotalqtotal ] ) calculated for each part of the sources and therefore , these parameters can be interpreted as the additive masses and charges of these interacting sources .",
    "the 5-parametric solution ( [ staticmetric ] ) - ( [ gammasigma ] ) presented above is asymptotically flat and the space - time geometry is regular far enough from the sources .",
    "however , for an arbitrary choice of parameters @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath177 , this solution may have some physically not reasonable singularities ( `` struts '' ) on the part of the axis of symmetry between the sources . like at the vertex of the cone , at these points , the local eucledean properties of space - time may be violated so that on the space - time sections @xmath317 , @xmath318 the ratio of the length @xmath120 of a small circle , surrounding the axis of symmetry @xmath1 and contracting to the point @xmath2 of this axis , to its radius @xmath319 multiplied by @xmath320 is not equal to a unit . the constraint imposed on the parameters which provide the absence of such conical singularities plays the role of equilibrium condition because it allows to select a physically acceptable solution in which these singularities are absent and the sources are in the equilibrium because of the balance between their gravitational and electromagnetic interactions .    as it follows from elementary considerations ,",
    "the limiting value of the square of the ratio @xmath321 for @xmath322 is equal to the value of the product @xmath323 at the point @xmath2 of the axis .",
    "however , the field equations imply that on the regular parts of the axis of symmetry the product @xmath324 does not depend on @xmath2 and therefore , it is a constant .",
    "however , the values of this constant can be different on different parts of the axis of symmetry separated by the sources , and the condition @xmath325 of the absence of conical singularities should be satisfied at each of these parts of the axis of symmetry .",
    "in our solution with two separated sources , there exists three parts of the axis of symmetry where the condition of the absence of conical points should be considered .",
    "there are two semi - infinite parts of the axis outside the sources . on the negative part @xmath14 , we have @xmath326 ( if the first source is a black hole ) or @xmath327 ( if the first source is a naked singularity ) and on this part @xmath328 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 , @xmath331 . on the positive part @xmath11 of the axis , @xmath332",
    "( if the second source is a black hole ) or @xmath333 ( if the second source is a naked singularity ) and we have there @xmath334 , @xmath335 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 .",
    "it is easy to see that on these parts of the axis the condition @xmath325 is satisfied for any choice of free parameters of our solution .",
    "however , it is not the case on the part @xmath338 of the axis between the sources .",
    "on @xmath338 we have @xmath339 and @xmath334 , @xmath340 , @xmath336 , @xmath331 and the product @xmath323 also takes there some constant value whose equality to a unit give us the equilibrium condition : @xmath341 it is interesting to note that this equilibrium condition looks just like the newtonian condition of equilibrium of two charged point - like masses , but in the case of general relativity this condition relates the masses of the reissner - nordstrm sources not with their charges @xmath238 and @xmath239 , but with the parameters @xmath244 and @xmath245 whose expressions in terms of masses @xmath236 , @xmath237 and charges @xmath238 , @xmath239 depend also on the @xmath2-distance @xmath177 separating the sources .",
    "the equilibrium condition ( [ equilibrium ] ) allows also to simplify the solution ( [ staticmetric ] ) - ( [ gammasigma ] ) and leads to the 4-parametric family which describes the superposed field of two reissner - nordstrm sources in equilibrium .",
    "this solution has been presented in our previous short paper @xcite . here",
    "we persent it in a bit different form using @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath241 as the basic set of parameters , such that the first four of them should satisfy the equilibrium condition ( [ equilibrium ] ) .",
    "for this solution the metric functions have the same expressions ( [ hfidgf ] ) where the polynomials @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 have the expressions @xmath342 \\mathcal{g}=m_1 x_2+m_2 x_1+\\gamma(q_1 y_1+q_2 y_2 ) \\\\[1ex ] \\mathcal{f}=q_1 x_2+q_2 x_1+\\gamma(m_1 y_1+m_2 y_2 ) \\end{array}\\quad\\right\\vert\\hskip1ex \\begin{array}{l } { } \\\\[1ex ] m_1 m_2=q_1 q_2\\\\[1ex ] { } \\\\[1ex ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath343 .",
    "the other physical parameters  the @xmath2-distance @xmath177 separating the sources and their charges are determined by the expressions @xmath344 the independent parameters @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath241 of this solution should be chosen so that the sources would be separated actually by some positive distance , i.e. @xmath345 .",
    "this concludes our description in this paper of some fragments of the monodromy transform approach and of the procedure for solution of the corresponding singular integral equations for stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum fields with simple rational monodromy data , which leads to the construction of the 5-parametric family of solutions for the field of two interacting reissner - nordstrm sources , and of the derivation from this solution of the 4-parametric family of solutions for the fields of equilibrium configurations of these sources .",
    "some properties of these equilibrium field configurations have been discussed in @xcite , however , a more detail analysis of physical and geometrical properties of these configurations , such as the structure of the superposed fields , influence on the geometry of horizons and on the space - time geometry inside the horizon of the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields created by another source , tidal influence of these fields on the structure of naked singularities , stability of equilibrium and probably , some others , are expected to be the subject of our next publications .",
