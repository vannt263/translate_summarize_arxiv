    "microtubules ( mts ) are fascinating biological macromolecules that are essential for intracellular trafficking , cell division and maintaining the cell shape",
    ". they display unique elastic and dynamic behavior , inherited by their complex self - assembling nanotube structure .",
    "surprisingly , despite an enormous accumulation of knowledge about their structure , the mts static and dynamic properties have challenged all attempts of a fully coherent interpretation . in this paper",
    "we develop the line of thoughts leading towards a new theory that provides a more comprehensive understanding of these mt s properties .",
    "the fundamental result is that stabilized mts spontaneously form large scale superhelices of micron size pitches and diameters .",
    "the mt s super - helical structure turns out to be a consequence of a cooperative interaction between its individual subunits that can sustain several stable curved conformations .",
    "cooperativity of fluctuating internal degrees of freedom in combination with the cylindrical mt symmetry lead to a helical state with very unique characteristics in the world of macromolecules : mts are helices that are permanently but coherently reshaping -i.e . changing their reference ground state configuration- by thermal fluctuations . in particular",
    "when clamped by one end mts undergo an unexpected zero energy motion .",
    "as we will see , this could be the key for a consistent interpretation of certain challenging experimental results not captured by the conventional scenarios and models .",
    "it is worth remarking , that the large majority of experiments probing the above mentioned properties are in - vitro experiments on mts with stabilizing drugs .",
    "we stress this point , as the experimentally prevalent presence of stabilizing agents is not innocent and could modify mt s properties .",
    "nevertheless there are reasons to believe that the theory developed here might be valid also for non treated mts .    before embarking on the road to a `` polymorphic mt theory '' , we first review the conventional understanding of the common mt properties as well as some key experiments which will be our necessary guides towards the model we propose .",
    "this paper which extends and deepens a previous short presentation of the idea of polymorphic mts @xcite is written in two parts . in the first part",
    ", we provide conceptual and graphical explanations of the ideas behind the model and investigate consequences of the here developed polymorphic mt model .",
    "we hope that this part is self consistent and didactic enough , so that a general reader can grasp the basic underlying ideas . in the second more technical part",
    ", the mathematical model is developed and quantitative results are presented . the details and derivations are left to an extensive appendix .",
    "microtubules are cytoskeletal protein filaments of eukaryotic cells fulfilling different structural and mechanical functions in the cell : mts act as `` cellular bones '' strongly influencing the cell shape , constitute the main routes for molecular motor mediated intracellular cargo transport @xcite and perform other important tasks like stirring the cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "besides , mts play a central role in the assembly of the mitotic spindle during cell division and are at the heart of the functioning of cilia and flagella @xcite .",
    "this versatility of mts in a variety of biological functions mainly relies on their unique high stiffness and on their dynamics of assembly and disassembly .",
    "the high rigidity of mts ( similar to hard plastic ) is due to their structure that is known in exquisite detail from @xmath0d electron microscopy reconstructions @xcite : mts are hollow tubes whose walls are formed by assembly of a variable number @xmath1 of parallel protofilaments ( pfs ) .",
    "the pfs themselves are built by head - to - tail self association of the @xmath2-tubulin heterodimer protein subunit ( yielding a polarity to mts ) whose structure has been resolved by electron crystallography @xcite .    in vivo ,",
    "mts most commonly appear with @xmath3 pfs @xcite ( although there are exceptions depending of the cell type ) , whereas in vitro a variety of structures with pf number ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 were observed @xcite .",
    "transitions of different lattice types ( mostly with the gain or loss of one pf ) within a single mt are also frequent @xcite",
    ". the mt lattice can accommodate for these different structures by twisting the pfs around the central mt axis although this process is energetically costly .",
    "the typical lattice twist repeat lengths ( pitches ) are @xmath6 for @xmath7 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 pf mts respectively , with + /-",
    "denoting right / lefthanded twist @xcite .",
    "as we will see the lattice twist is an essential property of the model that we will propose later on .",
    "any deviation from the most frequent , energetically favorable and thus less twisted configuration @xmath9 implies an internal prestrain in the mt lattice . the latter stress can locally deform the end portions of the lattice or even destabilize it @xcite .",
    "another internal prestrain in the mt lattice is believed to be caused by the tubulin subunit which upon incorporation into the lattice hydrolyzes a bound gtp  molecule converting it quickly into a gdp - tubulin form which has the tendency to form a curved state - curling radially away from the axis @xcite .",
    "the constraint imposed by the mt lattice however maintains the gdp - tubulin dimers in a straight unfavorable state - in turn trapping mechanical prestrain . in this conventional view mts",
    "are seen as internally prestrained but intrinsically straight euler beams .",
    "the gdp - tubulin prestrain is also believed to trigger rapid depolymerization called the polymerization `` catastrophe '' @xcite .",
    "the stability of mt is regulated either by the presence of a thin layer of yet unhydrolyzed gtp tubulin dimers at the growing mt end ( the so called gtp - cap - model , @xcite ) or by the binding of mt - associated proteins ( map ) or of drugs such as taxol .",
    "to investigate the mechanical properties of the mt lattice the presence of the polymerization dynamics is often an obstacle .",
    "as previously mentioned it can be switched off by stabilizing agents like taxol or maps . in the bulk of the available in vitro studies",
    "taxol stabilization has been the experimental method of choice for investigating the elastic properties of mt .",
    "it is believed that taxol maintains tubulin dimers in an approximately straight conformation and thus prevents depolymerization @xcite .",
    "however , direct em investigations of single taxol - gdp - pfs @xcite reveals a more complex and interesting picture . a taxol stabilized single pf",
    "can in fact coexist in several conformational states with comparable free energies : a straight state @xmath10 and a weakly curved state with intrinsic curvature @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "a third highly curved state with @xmath12 additionally appears after longer observation periods .",
    "notably elie - caille et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out a cooperative nature of the straight to curved transition within single pfs .",
    "these important findings -several conformational tubulin dimer states and cooperative interaction between them- will be one central ingredient of our model later on .",
    "going from a single protofilament to the whole tube , a central mechanical property of interest often measured for stabilized mts , is its persistence length defined as @xmath13 here @xmath14 stands for the flexural rigidity which is for an isotropic beam proportional to its elastic  young modulus @xmath15 .",
    "the persistence length is the length scale characterizing the filament s resistance to thermally induced bending moments .",
    "several experimental approaches have been developed to measure bending stiffness of taxol stabilized mts .",
    "one method consists in measuring mt s thermal shape fluctuations via dark - field microscopy @xcite or fluorescence light microscopy @xcite . alternatively in several other experiments ,",
    "@xmath16 has been determined by applying controlled bending forces via hydrodynamics @xcite , optical tweezers @xcite and atomic force microscope tips @xcite .",
    "interestingly the authors in @xcite observed that stabilized mts are not perfectly straight , but contain some form of quenched curvature disorder which needs to be subtracted from the measurements .",
    "in the same vein , the observations from dark - field images of the thermal fluctuations of the free end of axoneme - bound mts , show that taxol stabilized mts adopt a three - dimensional helicoid structure @xcite ( we will return to this point later on ) .    the persistence length obtained from these different experiments",
    "is set in the range of @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath19 with some of newer studies going down to @xmath20 ( cf below ) . for a standard semiflexible polymer ( like e.g. actin or dna ) we expect @xmath16 to be a material constant , in particular independent of the filament s length .",
    "however , for mts , the experimental @xmath16 data are not only highly scattered but extremely confusing on this point . that the persistence length could indeed depend on the mt length",
    "was first mentioned and observed in references @xcite and confirmed by other experimental measurements - probing either the thermal movement @xcite or the active bending deformations by electrical fields of individual taxol stabilized mts gliding on a kinesin - coated surface @xcite .",
    "in particular these techniques gave for short mt segments with submicron length a persistence length between @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath19 .",
    "this intriguing `` length dependent stiffness '' was also investigated by pampaloni et al who measured the lateral fluctuations of mts grafted to a substrate @xcite .",
    "these authors found a @xmath16 falling within a range of @xmath23 to @xmath24 @xmath19 for mt lengths varying from @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xmath27 - with a strong linear length-@xmath16 correlation .",
    "a similar experiment done in @xcite measured the longest relaxation time @xmath28 of mts for various mt lengths @xmath29 .",
    "it was found that mts exhibit unusually slow thermal dynamics compatible with @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "fig 9 ) - in sharp contrast to standard semiflexible filaments with @xmath31 . in @xcite , the relaxation time for long mts ( @xmath32 ) extracted from a 2-d shape analysis of taxol stabilized fluorescent mts shows an anomalous dynamics on short scales as well .",
    "furthermore it has also been experimentally found that the rigidity of mts depends on their growth velocity @xcite .",
    "all these experiments measuring the bending stiffness and the bending dynamics brought the community to the conclusion that the `` beam of life '' can not be seen as a simple euler beam . its complex internal structure should determine its elastic and dynamical properties .",
    "but which internal mode contributes to the now obvious elastic complexity , is the important question - a convincing answer of which is still missing .      even more intriguing than the issue of mt elasticity",
    "is perhaps the question :  what is the ground state of a mt ? while the naive answer - a straight rod - would be the most accepted view , a number of experiments put this mundane simplistic picture in doubt .",
    "for instance , wavy sinusoidal and circular shapes are frequently observed when mts are adsorbed to glass surfaces or confined between them . in this confined case",
    "the fourier mode analysis of mt deformations systematically reveals that a few discrete modes have a larger amplitude than the fluctuations around them @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite -supplementary material .",
    "this is a strong hint towards the presence of some type of `` frozen in '' curvature - dynamically quenched on experimental timescales . likewise in motility assays",
    ", it is often seen that when mts glide over a surface coated with molecular motors they follow wavy sinusoidal and often circular tracks @xcite , cf .",
    ". 1b . in this context ,",
    "particularly interesting is the observation by amos & amos @xcite of the formation of permanently circling mts ( see figs 1b ) .",
    "these unusual stable circular gliding structures persisted for many cycles and occasionally straightened again . as written by the authors",
    "@xcite , this suggests that `` an intact tubular polymer is capable of holding more than one conformational state without the help of an external force '' . from em images",
    "it was inferred that the underlying mechanism stems from the balance of individual taxol - gdp - tubulin dimers between two or more different stable conformations @xcite .    an even more clear hint towards the real nature of the `` frozen in ''  curvature was -as already mentioned- discovered by venier et al @xcite ( fig.1c ) who described stabilized mts as _ wavy periodic shapes _ with a half period of about @xmath33 .",
    "this observation combined with the fact that mts often went out of focus , lead the authors to `` suggest that taxol - treated microtubules may adopt a three - dimensional helicoid structure of @xmath34 pitch '' .",
    "therefore it seems that the mt curvature is a persistent attribute attached to its lattice . any serious attempt to fully understand the complexity of mt  elasticity",
    "can not avoid the question of its ground state . indeed understanding fluctuations around a particular state",
    "will be futile  as long as the origin of the state itself remains in the dark .      a first theoretical attempt to cope with some aspects of the described mt mechanical complexity was the `` soft shear model '' ( also called `` timoshenko beam model '' , or `` anisotropic composite material model '' ) @xcite . in this model",
    "the mt  is considered as an anisotropic fiber - reinforced material @xcite with the tubulin protofilaments acting as strong fibers weakly linked with easily shearable inter - protofilament bonds .",
    "some specific equilibrium statistical and mechanical properties of that model were investigated in @xcite .",
    "an interesting peculiarity and inherent consequence of this model is that any local lattice deformation gives rise to a long distance curvature relaxation @xcite and can lead to a long range interaction along the mt contour .",
    "this aspect of the `` soft shear model '' ( ssm ) is in phenomenological agreement with cooperative deformations induced by enzymes like katanin .",
    "furthermore this model predicts a length - dependent persistence length which approximately resembles the measured behavior @xcite .",
    "however in detail it suffers a number of difficulties and inconsistencies in particular :    -the ground state of ssm is straight - in conflict with the helical ground state observation @xcite .",
    "- the ssm  does not allow for lattice multistability as observed by amos & amos @xcite .",
    "- the predicted value of the shear modulus is extremely small @xcite ( @xmath35 times smaller than the young modulus ) .",
    "this would imply very strong shearing in bent microtubule structures .",
    "this however is unsupported by other experimental evidence .",
    "indeed observations of straight and highly bent mts shows that bending does not significantly modify the relative position of the inter - protofilament bonds @xcite .",
    "-the dynamics of clamped mts @xcite does not come naturally out from the ssm . to reach agreement and",
    "fit the experimental dynamics the shear model needs to introduce an ad hoc internal dissipation of unclear origin .    - for short mts ( @xmath36 ) that model is very far off and disagrees with the `` plateau '' region of the bending stiffness vs length relations ( cf .",
    "fig 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "a careful reanalysis of clamped mt experiments , cf .",
    "2,3 in @xcite , reveals two features not captured by the ssm : the persistence length scales for large @xmath37approximately as @xmath38 ( without signs of saturation ) while the relaxation times scale as @xmath39 .",
    "this exotic behavior naively suggests the presence of a limited angular hinge at the mt  clamping point .",
    "on the other hand artifacts that could trivially lead to a hinged behavior  ( like loose mt  attachment and punctual mt  damage ) were specifically excluded in experiments @xcite .    facing all these obstacles",
    "it becomes increasingly clear that the solution to all puzzles requires a cut and a radically different hypothesis .",
    "the new scenario proposed here is based on the hypothesis of _ cooperative _ _ internal _ mt lattice dynamics .",
    "the two central assumptions of our model are as follows :    \\(i ) the taxol - gdp - tubulin dimer is a conformationally multistable entity and fluctuates between at least 2 states on experimental time scales :  a straight and an outwards curved state ( figs . 1a and 2a ) .",
    "\\(ii ) there is a nearest - neighbor cooperative interaction of tubulin states along the pf axis .",
    "note that assumption i is very different from the conventional picture where gdp - tubulin has only _ one _ energetically favorable ( curved ) state .",
    "we will show that a model based on i and ii straightforwardly leads us to the very origin of mt ( super ) helicity and provides a coherent explanation for static and dynamic measurements in thermal fluctuation experiments .",
    "in contrast to the soft shear model , the present model is elastically isotropic but the monomer curvature is bistable .",
    "as we will see , the ground state in this new model is a highly degenerate 3 dimensional helix fluctuating between many equivalent configurations .      in this chapter",
    "we will give a simple pictorial panorama over the consequences of assumptions i and ii .",
    "what happens when tubulin dimers obeying assumption i  are trapped in the circularly symmetric mt lattice ?",
    "starting from assumption i we imagine that the straight and curved gdp - tubulin state have a certain energy difference @xmath40 with the curved state being slightly more favorable .",
    "the strict preference for the curved state is however only true if the tubulin dimers are free i.e. not confined to the lattice .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting once they are incorporated into the  lattice .",
    "obviously the outwards bending tendency of the curved state is in conflict with the geometry of the lattice .",
    "switching a dimer on one mt  side will frustrate the dimers on the opposite side of the tube and prevent them from switching at the same time . on the other hand the direct neighbors of the curved dimer ( on the same mt side ) will profit and switch easier to the curved state , as the lattice is already slightly `` pre - bent '' in the correct direction .",
    "this peculiar interplay of negative and positive interaction gives rise to a clustering of curved dimer states into a single block on one side of the tube cf .",
    "fig . 2b .",
    "this immediately raises the question about the orientation of this curved dimer block . which mt  side will be selected , and in which direction will the mt  overall bend , can only be decided by the process of _ spontaneous symmetry breaking_. that is , if the ground state is a curved dimer block , it will be a highly degenerate state ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in turn",
    "it can be expected to thermally move through the lattice at next to no energy cost ( apart from some friction ) !",
    "this is the most essential feature of the present model .",
    "so far we have considered only a single mt  cross - section .",
    "if the assumption ii ( cooperativity ) would not hold the curved state blocks would pick their sides at each section completely independently .",
    "the tube would locally curve in random uncorrelated directions and the effect of tubulin multistability would stay essentially invisible on the larger scale . however according to assumption ii",
    "the blocks become correlated in orientation and prefer to stack on the top of each other .",
    "this then leads to macroscopically a bent - in fact a circular mt - if the pf  were not twisted around the central mt  axis ( see fig .",
    "this provision brings us to the last interesting point .",
    "as already mentioned mt lattices are generically twisted i.e. their pfs are not strictly parallel . with a cooperative interaction along the pfs - which are now twisting around the tube axis - the final product of assumption i  and ii will be a long pitched helix ! the pitch of the helix should coincide with the lattice twist repeat length @xmath6 for @xmath7 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 pf mts respectively .",
    "the created `` polymorphic helix '' , however will not be unique and will be able to reshape between its @xmath41indistinguishable orientation states .",
    "when we graft one end of such a polymorphic helix onto a surface ( as e.g. performed in @xcite ) the helix will still be able to switch between the equivalent orientations and perform a motion that we call `` wobbling '' ( see fig .",
    "it is exactly this type of motion that can give rise to the static and dynamic effects measured in @xcite .    to see this",
    "we can approximate the movement of a clamped polymorphic helix that is switching between its equivalent ground states with a `` rigid conical rotor '' ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . for such a rotor",
    "the transverse displacement @xmath42 of the mt end grows linearly with its length @xmath43 using the naive definition of persistence length @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the ensemble average ) and the fact that @xmath46 this apparent persistence length becomes proportional to the length @xmath47 this scaling ( cf .",
    "11 ) is in agreement with the experimental results in @xcite giving us the first hint that the model is on the right track .",
    "appendix e comments on the robustness of this conical hinge - like motion against a limited local hindrance of the wobbling mode due to the adsorbed part of the grafted mt .",
    "a further encouragement comes from the study of the dynamics of the model . making again the approximation of a rigid conical rotation ( induced by wobbling ) the observed unusual scaling of the longest relaxation time @xmath30",
    "can also be easily understood .",
    "in fact a slender object of length @xmath29 rotated along a conical surface has a friction constant @xmath48 . in turn the longest relaxation time is given by diffusional equilibration time on the cone , i.e. @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "it turns out that the model correctly predicts both the exponent and the prefactor of the experimental relaxation time .",
    "in addition it is further reassuring that the helical ground state(s ) of the model provides a rationale for the observation of mt  helices by venier et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bulk of observations cited here is made in vitro on taxol stabilized mts .",
    "it is known that taxol inhibits mt disassembly by maintaining the tubulin dimer in a state that strongly favors polymerization .",
    "but from the experiments reported above it is also clear that taxol does not suppress all tubulin conformational changes : taxol - gdp - tubulin dimer has multiple stable conformations @xcite . how do these in vitro findings relate to mts in vivo ?    it is a common empirical observation in many in vivo systems that despite their high bending stiffness mts are often seen curved or highly wavy on micron scales @xcite .",
    "for instance in @xcite , highly sinusoidal mts on the periphery of living llc - pk1 cells were observed .",
    "these shapes are usually explained as a consequence of motor induced buckling opposed by a gel - like environment that leads to finite wavelength- buckling @xcite . while the `` buckling in a gel '' interpretation is physically appealing a closer look at the data in @xcite ( in particular the accompanying movie material ) reveals an absence of correlation in buckling _",
    "directions _ of neighboring mts .",
    "this observation puts a question mark on the participation of a background continuum gel - as in this case the strains in the gel would necessarily propagate to neighboring microtubules and lead to spatially correlated buckling events - in sharp contrast with observations .",
    "therefore we are left with a robust phenomenon of sinusoid , constant wavelength mts - however without a definite interpretation so far .",
    "the phenomenology of stable rings @xcite and wavy sinusoid mts forming in gliding assays @xcite is strikingly similar and visually indistinguishable from the pure in vivo observations @xcite . indeed , in both situations highly curved lattice states of very similar magnitudes @xmath50 are readily observed .",
    "this analogy between in vivo and vitro cases suggests that tubulin dimers - both in vivo and taxol stabilized ( in vitro ) posses an identical highly curved state ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this highly curved state appears to be activated within the lattice only under compressive loads and seems to be a universal property of gdp tubulin itself - independent of taxol stabilization .    on the other hand the weakly curved state of taxol - gdp - dimer ( @xmath52 ) ) is soft enough to be activated by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the empirical evidence for the weakly curved state in vivo is far less obvious than for the highly curved state .",
    "the slight deformations induced by the former would be more difficult to distinguish from other mt deforming effects in living cells like motors , polymerization forces , presence of lattice defects , bundling and microtubule associated protein action .",
    "however the observed phenomenology of length dependent persistence length of mts growing from centrosomes in egg extracts @xcite ( no taxol present ) resembles qualitatively and quantitatively the in vitro observations @xcite .",
    "this is one more indication that the dynamic mt  polymorphism could persist also in vivo .",
    "at least two possible biological implications of the helicoidal polymorphic mt nature come straight to mind .",
    "first , a curved or helical beam under compressive load responds like a mechanical spring and is therefore much softer ( in tension , compression and bending ) than a straight beam",
    ". therefore a network of helical mts might be important for the overall mechanical compliance of the cell .",
    "a perfectly straight mt buckled by an extracellular load would be much more susceptible to mechanical failure and depolymerization than a soft compliant helix .",
    "second , helical shapes are geometrically ( topologically ) prevented from side - by - side aggregation , can thus evade the formation of bundles and instead form lose networks with much fewer contacts .",
    "it appears that a tuned helicity ( that can be switched on or off ) could be a good mechanical control parameter for the formation of different cytoskeletal structures . while the bulk of the cytoplasmic mts is preferably in the lose network state ( favored by helicity ) in occasional situations like the neuronal axons straight aligned mts",
    "are required .",
    "in such a situation the bundling could be triggered by switching the lattice to the straight state .",
    "remarkably in the process of axonal retraction the straight axonal bundle is destabilized ( and eventually contracted towards the cell soma )  by an apparent transition of the mts to a wavy coiled state @xcite very reminiscent in shape to single wavy mts from cell soma @xcite",
    ".    in general mt s polymorphism might have other , less obvious biological implications that still have to be identified .",
    "in particular a more speculative possibility is that the tubulin s allosteric multistability might also be a piece in the puzzle of mt `` catastrophes '' .",
    "a cooperative curvature switch might trigger a transition from growth to depolymerization .",
    "maybe the most fascinating aspect could lie in the possibility of signal transmission along single mts via a long range conformational switch .",
    "if our model is correct this is the most inherent and distinct consequence of the underlying mechanism .",
    "we conclude here the qualitative description of essential ideas behind the polymorphic tube model . in the following we switch gears and present in more quantitative detail the mathematical model .",
    "the mathematically less inclined reader is invited to fly over some figures , comparisons with experiments , maybe pick up additional concepts ( such as polymorphic defects and their dynamics ) and jump to the perspectives section which will underline the essential biological consequences .",
    "until now the discussion was qualitative and in the following we build the mathematical model of the polymorphic mt .",
    "we will provide quantitative arguments and model experimental data , justifying thus a posteriori the previous discussion . in this section",
    ", we will focus on the thermally induced weakly curved state in taxol - stabilized mts and leave the case of mechanically induced highly curved mts for further works .",
    "we model the gdp - tubulin dimer state by a two state variable @xmath53 which corresponds to the straight and@xmath54curved state at each lattice site .",
    "the @xmath55  is the circumferential pf index and @xmath56   $ ] is the longitudinal position variable along the mt centerline .",
    "we recall that our model is based on the following assumptions :    \\(i ) the taxol - gdp - tubulin dimer fluctuates between 2 states - straight and curved - ( fig .",
    "2a ) with an energy difference @xmath57 favoring the curved state .",
    "the energy density resulting from the switching of tubulin dimers ( at a given mt section ) is then given by @xmath58 with@xmath59 the dimer length .",
    "\\(ii ) there is an ising type nearest - neighbor cooperative interaction of tubulin states _ along _ the pf axis with an interaction energy @xmath60 favoring nearest neighbor dimers on the same pf to be in the same state .",
    "this leads to the interaction energy density : @xmath61 the last term missing in our description is the elastic energy density of the mt lattice . for a usual isotropic euler beam the material deformations @xmath62",
    "are related to the centerline curvature vector @xmath63 via @xmath64 with @xmath65 the radial material vector in the cross - section . for a polymorphic mt , modelled as a continuum material made of @xmath1 pfs ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "its actual deformation will depend on the polymorphism - induced prestrain @xmath67 in this case the elastic energy density of the mt can be written as @xmath68 where the integration in @xmath69 goes over the annular mt cross - section with @xmath70 @xmath71 the inner and outer mt radii respectively .",
    "the prestrain @xmath72 is a function of the polymorphic state of the tubulin dimers .",
    "its definition requires a decomposition of the tubulin dimer in an inner part ( facing the tube axis ) and an outer part ( facing from the tube axis outwards ) , cf .",
    "we assume that each curved dimer state generates a positive prestrain @xmath73 on its inner part and an equal but negative prestrain @xmath74 on its outer part . we can then write @xmath75 @xmath76}\\left (   r\\right )   -i_{[r_{o}-d_{pf}/2,r_{o}]}\\left (   r\\right ) \\right ]   $ ] @xmath77}\\left (   \\alpha\\right )   $ ] where @xmath78}\\left (   x\\right )   = 1 $ ] if @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 otherwise ( heaviside function ) and @xmath81 is the pf diameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 appearing in the angular part of @xmath72 is the natural lattice twist that leads to the proper geometric rotation of a pf around the tube axis .",
    "this parameter is lattice type dependent and takes discrete values @xmath83 for @xmath7 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 pf mts respectively @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we can estimate the prestrain @xmath84 from the experimental value of the single switched pf s curvature @xmath85 -measured in ref.@xcite on single taxol - stabilized pfs - to be @xmath86 collecting all energy contributions together the total elastic +  polymorphic energy of the mt is then given by@xmath87 the ground state within this model is determined by the interplay of the first two terms @xmath69 and @xmath88 the last term @xmath89 rules over cooperativity and is responsible for the suppression of defects in the ideal polymorphic order ( cf .",
    "fig . 7 ) .",
    "a large value of the cooperativity constant with @xmath90 would imply a defect free lattice .",
    "however the presence of the latter defects ( and their motion ) are a necessary ingredient for the overall rearrangement of the helix as discussed later on .    to understand the basic behavior of the ideal helical ground state without defects - i.e. pfs are individually in a uniform state ( either curved or straight)- we initially restrict ourselves to the simplified energy density @xmath91 . to investigate the mt geometry we first introduce two reference frames ( fig .",
    "one is the material frame with base vectors @xmath92 attached to the mt cross - section .",
    "the other is an external fixed laboratory frame with base vectors @xmath93 putting the mt along the @xmath94 axis direction and considering small mt angular deflections we have @xmath95 . in this case",
    "the two frames are simply related to each other by a rotation transformation @xmath96 given by the internal mt lattice twist @xmath82 , such that @xmath97 with @xmath98{cc}\\cos q_{0}s & -\\sin q_{0}s\\\\ \\sin q_{0}s & \\cos q_{0}s \\end{array } \\right )   \\label{r(s)}\\ ] ] to rewrite @xmath99 in a more illuminating fashion , we define two important order parameters at each mt cross - section .",
    "the first one of them is the _ vectorial polymorphic order parameter _",
    "@xmath100 physically , @xmath101 - a 2d vector at each local material frame section attached to the mt ( cf fig .",

    "in particular the 2d geometry will strongly perturb the preferentially 3-dimensional helical ground state .",
    "the active contribution of strong motor forces on the trajectory of short mts is an additional potential perturbation .",
    "effects of mt buckling and axial mt rotation by kinesins become likely important .",
    "this said and ignoring the differences we can still compare ( in order of magnitude ) our and dekker groups results @xcite . for micron",
    "sized mts we obtain @xmath344 in approximate agreement with @xmath345 obtained in @xcite .",
    "one should mention that the two cited studies @xcite give strongly different results depending on whether free gliding or gliding assay with additional electric field were considered .",
    "this difference comes from the larger deformations induced by the electric field .",
    "therefore the comparison of our theory with the passive gliding assay appears more appropriate and gives a closer agreement .",
    "in summary , we have suggested a new model that connects some of the most persistent and confusing experimental findings concerning microtubules .",
    "starting from a rather broad spectrum of ( apparently ) disconnected observations we have progressively built the case for a new hypothesis : the existence of an internal switching of the gdp tubulin dimer within the microtubule lattice .",
    "why do microtubules become helically wavy , why do they switch to permanently bent circular states , why do they fluctuate anomalously when clamped ?",
    "these three dangling questions became the central pillars for the present model .",
    "surprisingly , the simple assumption of a bistable gdp - tubulin seems to explain these otherwise disparate phenomena in a unified manner .",
    "as we know from recent experiments - the bistability hypothesis of taxol stabilized protofilaments is an empirical fact indeed @xcite .",
    "we have shown here , that the incorporation of such a bistable tubulin into a closed elastic lattice changes its free behavior - it introduces strong conformational competition among the tubulin dimers .",
    "tubulin units on opposite sides of the tube now start to compete for who is going to switch to the curved state .",
    "the lattice induced frustration does not allow all the tubulin dimers to minimize their energy individually and to switch to their preferred states at the same time .",
    "the symmetry breaking induced by this frustration mechanism leads to a global microtubule lattice curving .",
    "remarkably the curving direction is chosen randomly - and this has profound consequences .",
    "the microtubule can chose between many energetic ground states ( as many states as protofilaments in the lattice ) .",
    "when we graft one end of the microtubule onto a substrate while still allowing it to chose its bending direction freely the strange energy degeneracy generates a very unusual thermal motion . in this case",
    "the microtubule s motion follows -roughly speaking- a cone and it rotates - or `` wobbles''- at no energy cost around its attachment tangent .",
    "this mode of motion - which is not to be confused with material frame rotation ( which is strictly prohibited by grafting ) - is probably among the most striking outcomes of the two state gdp - tubulin model .",
    "it is exactly this behavior that allows to consistently explain the measurements of unusual lateral fluctuations of grafted microtubules @xcite .",
    "we have focussed here on modelling taxol stabilized microtubules and the question naturally arises if the model proposed here affects the real in vivo microtubules . on the one hand the weakly curved state that is involved in the soft polymorphic dynamics as described here seems to be ( so far ) a specific signature of taxol stabilized gdp tubulin state . on the other hand",
    "we have argued that the naturally occurring high curvature gdp - tubulin state could coexist with the straight state in the lattice under in vivo conditions where mts are stabilized with maps .",
    "the involvement of this high curvature state switching seems to manifest itself in motor driven straight to wavy transitions of mts in many living cell systems @xcite .",
    "a particularly impressive instance of such a polymorphic switching event in vivo could be found in the process of axonal retraction where the whole mt cytoskeleton of the axon undergoes a straight to helical transition and in turn retracts towards the soma @xcite . to understand these dramatic transitions in vivo",
    "the present theory has to be advanced and modified in two manners .",
    "first , the effect of large active motor forces ( rather than thermal ones ) has to be taken into account .",
    "in particular , one expects that under strong buckling forces even thermodynamically unfavorable states can become activated and constitute the ground state upon large loads .",
    "second , in virtually all in vivo experiments mts are essentially confined in 2d as the containing cells adsorb to the glass substrate and assume a vary flat fried egg configuration .",
    "consequently , the measured properties will not necessarily reflect the three - dimensional properties of the molecule .",
    "this is particularly important for a mt transformed to a polymorphic helix state where the confinement entails naturally a strong deformation ( of the initially 3 dimensional ground state ) . under confinement",
    "the helical bending and torsional modes become strongly coupled and bring about new physical effects . in particular",
    "a torsionally very soft helix will have a tendency to unwind and form in extreme cases circular arcs - reminiscent of the rings observed in gliding assay experiments @xcite .",
    "finally , the local action of molecular motors could trigger a switching to the highly curved state .",
    "while for classical motors like kinesin 1 direct evidence for such a mode of action is still missing its relative kinesin 13 @xcite has a well documented ability to actively trigger radial bending of protofilaments .",
    "other molecules like katanin @xcite have also been suggested to perturb the lattice and trigger longer range transitions @xcite .",
    "this opens the intriguing question : could classical motors ( kinesin 1 and dynein ) trigger cooperative state transitions and even transmit conformational signals along the tube ? considering the present model for stabilized mts ( where high cooperativity is inherent to the data interpretation ) this idea might not be far fetched .",
    "in fact some evidence towards long range cooperativity of kinesin binding along the mt was presented by muto et al .",
    "@xcite - however these results still await robust reproduction .",
    "this brings us to the question of what experiments should be performed in order to nail down the polymorphic mechanism or any other mechanism for mt dynamics . with microtubules being such delicate , subtle and possibly long range correlated objects ( as suggested here ) a general rule of thumb for experiments should be : treat them more gently ( do not confine ) and observe more carefully ( look for correlated motion ) .",
    "a simple yet important experiment would be a systematic direct observation of one - side grafted but otherwise _ completely unconfined _ mts fluorescently labelled _ along their full contour length_. as mentioned the presence of a quasi 2d confinement in thin chambers as used in most mt experiments so far would perturb the native helical mt state and should be therefore explicitly avoided . the freely suspended gold - em nanogrid attachment geometry as used by pampaloni et al . seems particularly suited for that task .",
    "going beyond pampaloni et al . who labelled and traced the mt end only ( via a bead )",
    ", the microtubules should be visualized along the full contour in this geometry .",
    "tracing of several or all points along the contour should reveal the predicted sinusoid- helical nature of mt states .",
    "the present model predicts a peculiar cooperatively rearranging helix state with characteristic tell tale curvature correlations between different lattice positions which are entirely absent for usual semiflexible filaments . directly observing such collective motions -like the suggested `` wobbling mode '' - while prohibiting trivial spacial rotations that could mask the effects ( by mt grafting ) would constitute smoking gun evidence for a polymorphism related mechanism .    in conclusion",
    ", we have proposed a novel model for internal mt lattice dynamics .",
    "we have shown that it accounts for the otherwise mysterious mt helicity @xcite , the anomalous length dependent lateral fluctuation static @xcite and dynamic scaling  @xcite .",
    "the latter two phenomena appear as mere consequences of the peculiar wobbling motion  of the polymorphic cooperatively switching mt lattice .",
    "although most of the observations discussed here are made in vitro on taxol - stabilized mts , we provided arguments in favor the existence of polymorphic mt states in vivo .",
    "we speculate that the implied conformational bistability of tubulin and the allosteric interaction are more than just nature s way to modulate the elastic properties of its most important cytoskeletal mechano - element .",
    "it could also be a missing piece in the puzzle of polymerization `` catastrophes '' .",
    "even more intriguingly the predicted structural cooperativity could allow for long range conformational signalling along single mts and turn the latter into an efficient `` confotronic '' wire transmitting regulatory signals across the cell .",

    "it therefore deserves a closer consideration .    in the experiments by pampaloni @xcite et al . and taute et al .",

    "it is likely that @xmath442 1 - 2 protofilaments will establish localized chemical contacts with the gold microgrid . while a substantial perturbation of the dimer like e.g. denaturation appears unlikely , it is unclear to what extent this procedure will perturb the inner ( polymorphic ) dynamics of the entire tubulin dimer units . in principle",
    "one can anticipate two plausible scenarios that would to a varying degree interfere with the free `` wobbling '' motion :      s2 ) the cooperativity is too weak to compete with the constraints imposed by the surface ( including chemical perturbations ) and the polymorphic transition does not propagate into the straight adsorbed mt section .    in both cases",
    "we have a non vanishing deflection angle between a forced ( adsorbed ) planar section and the free helical section direction - causing effectively the characteristic mt `` kink '' at the surface interface .",
    "however the rotational mobility of this `` kink '' ( wobbling mode ) which is integral to our theory will be affected in slightly different manner .",
    "if in case s1 in the adsorbed section the polymorphic order parameter p can rearrange to some extent ( by switching the monomer states without causing a detectable deformation ) except for possibly in the few surface interacting dimers , then the effects of the `` wobbling '' motion will be hindered only mildly in the following sense . to retrieve the anomalous lateral fluctuations it is indeed enough for the wobbling angle @xmath185 to move freely in a certain non - vanishing angular interval .",
    "a single complete or multiple rotations of the order parameter @xmath101 are not strictly necessary for the `` hinge '' effect - and they are in fact equivalent in lateral projection ( as in experiment ) to the motion of the wobbling angle @xmath185 in the smaller interval @xmath444 $ ] .",
    "note that even smaller intervals than that will lead to a similar phenomenology ( in particular dynamic and static variable scalings with length ) .",
    "thus the conical hinge - like motion is in a sense robust with respect to a limited local rotational hindrance perturbation in the adsorbed region .    in the scenario",
    "s2 the situation is somehow simpler as the polymorphic dynamics of the adsorbed region is not involved in the process ( the polymorphic order parameter vanishes there : @xmath102 ) .",
    "wobbling is realized through a coherent rearrangement of the free mt section alone - without a strong coupling to the adsorbed region .",
    "although both attachment scenarios s1 and s2 appear to some extent plausible , at present it is difficult to make reliable statements about their respective likelihood .",
    "in fact only a posteriori we can cautiously state that based on the experimental static and dynamic measurement evidence : the chain `` wobbles '' to a high enough extent to display the effects that we observe .",
