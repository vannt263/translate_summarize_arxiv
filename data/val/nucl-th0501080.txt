    "the surface entropy of large clusters was introduced by fisher in his droplet model ( fdm ) @xcite . from the study of the combinatorics of clusters , fisher postulated that the leading contribution to the surface entropy is proportional to the surface @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath1 ( in dimensionless units ) .",

    "the surface entropy was studied recently in our paper @xcite .",
    "there we developed the `` hills and dales model '' ( hdm ) which is a statistical model of surface deformations that obeys the volume conservation of considered clusters . using the novel mathematical method , the laplace - fourier transform @xcite",

    "the cluster volume is conserved in average , but to apply the hdm to small and finite clusters it is necessary to consider an exact volume conservation using the canonical formulation .",
    "therefore , in present paper we consider the canonical formalism for the hdm and obtain the infimum for the surface entropy of finite and large clusters .",
    "for the limit of vanishing deformations we also introduce the _ semi - grand canonical ensemble _ which occupies an intermediate place between the grand canonical and canonical surface ensembles . with the help of the laplace - fourier transform technique @xcite the canonical surface partition ( csp ) and the semi - canonical surface partition ( sgcsp )",

    "the conclusions are formulated in sect .",
    "the hdm is a statistical model of surface deformations .",
    "we impose a necessary constraint that the deformations should conserve the total volume of the cluster of @xmath6-constituents . as in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", the main interest is focused on the deformations of vanishing amplitudes .",
    "this is sufficient to find both an absolute supremum and absolute infimum for the @xmath2-coefficient of the hdm . in this case",
    "the shape of the deformation can not be important to our result , so we can choose the regular one .",
    "for this reason we shall consider cylindrical deformations of positive height @xmath7 ( hills ) and negative height @xmath8 ( dales ) , with @xmath9-constituents at the base . for simplicity it is assumed that the top ( bottom ) of the hill ( dale ) has the same shape as the surface of the original cluster of @xmath6-constituents .",
    "we also assume that : ( i ) the statistical weight of deformations @xmath10 is given by the boltzmann factor due to the change of the surface @xmath11 in units of the surface per constituent @xmath12 ; ( ii ) all hills of heights @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the maximal height of the hill with @xmath9-constituents at the base ) have the same probability @xmath15 besides the statistical one ; ( iii ) assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) are valid for the dales .",
    "these assumptions are not too restrictive and allow us to simplify the analysis and find the one - particle statistical partition of the deformation of the @xmath9-constituent base as a convolution of two probabilities discussed above : @xmath16 } { \\sigma_{\\rm o } p_k h_k } \\ , , % \\ ] ] where upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to hills ( dales ) .",
    "here @xmath17 is the perimeter of the cylinder base .",
    "our next step is to find a geometrical partition ( degeneracy factor ) or the number of ways to place the center of a given deformation on the surface of the @xmath6-constituent cluster which is occupied by the set of @xmath18 deformations of the @xmath19-constituents base .    for the grand canonical surface partition ( gcsp )",

    "it is clearly seen now that the first multiplier in the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ two ] ) corresponds to the available surface to place the center of each of @xmath25 deformations that exist on the cluster surface .",
    "it is necessary to impose the condition @xmath26 which ensures that the deformations do not overlap .",

    "this can be done within the canonical ensemble assuming that the number of the hills @xmath30 of the @xmath9-constituent base is always identical to the number of corresponding dales , i.e. @xmath31 . then the canonical geometrical partition can be cast as follows @xmath32 ( 2 s_1)^{-1 } } \\ , , % \\ ] ] where the factor two in the denominator of the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ nfour ] ) accounts for the fact that it is necessary to place simultaneously the centers of two @xmath9-constituent base deformations ( hill and dale ) out of @xmath33 on the surface of cluster . using the geometrical partition ( [ nfour ] ) , one can write the partition function of canonical ensemble , the csp , as follows @xmath34}{n_k!}^{n_k } \\right ] % \\theta(2 s_1 { \\cal g}_c)\\ , . % \\ ] ] as in the case of the gcsp , the @xmath35-function in the csp ensures that only configurations with positive value of the free surface of cluster are accounted for , but this constraint makes the calculation of the partition ( [ nfive ] ) very difficult .",
    "an additional problem in evaluating the partitions ( [ three ] ) and ( [ nfive ] ) appears due to the explicit @xmath36 dependence of the maximal base of deformations via @xmath37 because in this case the standard method to deal with the excluded volume partitions , the usual laplace transform @xcite in @xmath36 , can not be applied .",

    "it corresponds to the case , when the hills and dales of the same base are considered to be indistinguishable . for that we would like to explore the fact that according to ( [ one ] ) the statistical probabilities of hills and dales of the same base are equal .",
    "then for the infinitesimally small amplitudes of deformations the volume conservation constraint is fulfilled trivially . for finite amplitudes of deformations",
    "this ensemble corresponds to the case of clusters of intermediate size , when its surface is sufficiently filled with deformations that it is impossible to add one more deformation of large base in order to conserve the cluster volume , but it is possible to place many deformations of a much smaller ( or even smallest ) base .",

    "in some cases the agreement with the lattice data is remarkable - @xmath114 coincides with the arithmetical average of the @xmath115-coefficients for square and triangular lattices up to a fifth digit , but in most cases the values agree within a few per cent .",
    "the latter is not surprising because the hdm estimates the surface entropy of a single cluster , whereas on the lattice the spin clusters do interact with each other and this , of course , changes the surface tension and , consequently , affects the value of critical temperature .",

    "both partitions conserve the volume of the deformed cluster and take into account all surface deformations with non - negative value of the free surface of this cluster .",
    "the grand canonical surface partition conserves the cluster volume in average , whereas in canonical formulation it is conserved exactly .",
    "these partitions are solved exactly for an arbitrary ( finite or infinite ) size of largest deformation by the laplace - fourier transformation technique and the the general analytical expression ( [ nfifteen ] ) for these partitions in terms of the set of isochoric ensemble singularities are derived .",
