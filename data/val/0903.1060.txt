    "the physics of the quark - gluon plasma has turned out to be more difficult than initially expected ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while it has been noted  @xcite that the failure of the perturbative description could have been anticipated on general grounds , it has not been obvious what is the form and furthermore the dynamical origin of such a strongly non - perturbative behaviour . on the other hand",
    "it is by now clear from lattice calculations at finite temperature ( for a review on recent developments see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) that while in qcd there is a cross - over , in pure yang - mills theory or gluodynamics for @xmath1 there is a first order phase transition .",
    "actually , in the simpler case of gluodynamics the deconfinement phase transition is monitored by the expectation value of the polyakov loop which acts as an order parameter of the associated breaking of the center @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the finding of power corrections above the phase transition  @xcite and the possible explanation in terms of a dimension-2 condensate of the dimensionally reduced theory of such a special object suggests pursuing the same idea in other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "power corrections are ubiquitous at high energies and zero temperature through condensates being the remnant of non - perturbative effects . from this viewpoint",
    "there is no reason why they should not be present at high temperatures as genuinely non - perturbative effects . in the present paper",
    "we detect and analyze power corrections on the trace anomaly density at finite temperature as obtained in lattice calculations , and which can only be effectively explained by a dimension two condensate . unlike the polyakov loop , the trace anomaly corresponds to a physical and measurable quantity not only on the lattice but also experimentally in the qcd case . in this way",

    "the thermodynamics of the phase transition is analyzed in section  [ sec:4 ] following an interesting insight by pisarski  @xcite .",
    "the physics below the phase transition in the confined region should be describable in terms of colour singlet glueball states , an issue that we address within a large @xmath3 perspective where the interactions among glueballs are much suppressed . in passing we note a hagedorn looking glueball exponentially growing spectrum with practically no impact on the confined region .",
    "we analyze in section [ sec : rg - improvement ] our results from the point of view of analytical schemes based on perturbation theory . actually , a common deficiency of the poorly converging perturbation theory is the occurrence of unpleasant infrared divergences and manifest spurious scale dependence .",
    "perturbative resummations such as hard thermal loop remove the infrared singularities due to debye screening but provide too weak a signal as compared to the lattice data .",
    "our analysis suggests that those methods might in fact describe the deconfined phase _",
    "after _ the power corrections have been subtracted off . to reinforce this conclusion a renormalization group improvement of the perturbative free energy is undertaken in this section .",
    "we find that besides implementing renormalization scale independence , this resummation mimics the hard thermal loop calculations within estimated uncertainties , and as a consequence similar conclusion follows : power corrections dominate the deconfined phase while perturbatively based physics plays a minor role wherever it may be considered applicable .",
    "the dimension two condensate has naturally explained the presence of power corrections for the polyakov loop and singlet @xmath4 free energy  @xcite .",

    "so , more accurate data are desirable in order to identify contributions from condensates of dimension 4 .    in any case",
    "it is clear the existence of power corrections which are beyond the scope of the radiative corrections accounted for in perturbation theory .",
    "it should be mentioned that similar power corrections have been identified in the trace anomaly in gluodynamics in @xmath41 dimensions  @xcite .    integrating the trace anomaly , as modeled in ( [ eq : fit ] ) , from @xmath42 and using the continuity of the pressure across the phase transition yields the following form for the pressure @xmath43 clearly this expression can not be used at very high temperatures unless @xmath44 , a result suggested by the fit . on the opposite extreme , integrating from very high energies , where radiative corrections should dominate , yields @xmath45 where @xmath46 matching at some temperature @xmath47 , gives @xmath48 from @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( assuming @xmath44 ) .",

    "one sensible question to ask is what is the temperature where perturbation theory applies .",
    "we address this question in more detail in section   [ sec : rg - improvement ] .",
    "if for the moment perturbative corrections are disregarded ( they are small anyhow ) , it is worth reviewing why the previous results are completely against the idea of a gluon plasma .",
    "actually , the standard textbook argument requires the bag pressure to equilibrate the free gluon gas at the critical temperature @xmath60 yielding the trace anomaly @xmath61 as already shown , this behaviour is excluded by lattice data .    in this section",
    "we elaborate on a suggestion by pisarski  @xcite , @xmath62 which achieves a fair description of the data assuming infinitely heavy glueball masses , negligible radiative perturbative corrections , and a temperature dependent bag energy , called _ fuzzy bag _ , @xmath63 as shown in section  [ sec : dim2ctraceanomaly ] , dimension-2 condensates provide a natural explanation of this fuzzy bag picture _ including _ the correct power behaviour and coefficient , while simultaneously account for power corrections in the polyakov loop and the @xmath0-potential at a quantitative level . a study of the thermodynamics of this fuzzy constant is also made in ref .",
    "@xcite within the holographic qcd approach based on the ads / cft correspondence .      at very high temperatures , where radiative corrections become negligible , the free gluonic gas relation @xmath64 holds .",
    "on the other hand , in the confined phase , i.e. , below the critical temperature @xmath13 , the spectrum is believed to be saturated by glueballs  ( for reviews see e.g. ref .",

    "this is much heavier than the critical temperature @xmath68 ( a mysteriously disparate scale  @xcite ) .",

    "given the goodness of the description we may try to improve by actually computing the pressure of an ensemble of finite mass glueballs in the confined phase using the 12 glueball spectrum currently determined on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "quite generally such a calculation would require the use of the quantum field theoretical version of the virial expansion  @xcite and thus to take into account corrections from binary , ternary and higher order collisions .",
    "for instance , for a binary collision the threshold for the first possible lowest glueball - glueball resonance is located at twice the glueball mass @xmath78 which lies above the 5th glueball and is expected to produce an insignificant contribution for @xmath79 . fortunately , the first four low - lying glueballs computed on the lattice are kinematically stable bound states . actually , within a large @xmath3 framework",
    "one has a gas of stable and non - interacting glueballs since @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "so it seems safe to treat the glueballs as a gas of free bosons .",

    "a convenient low temperature expansion gives @xmath86 where the sum over @xmath71 corresponds to the thermal loops and @xmath87 is a modified bessel function of the second kind .",

    "@xmath107 we get the result @xmath108 where the error has been estimated from the uncertainty in the glueball masses .",
    "this value of the pressure is consistent with the fit to the data , although the glueball spectrum contribution is not so strongly constrained by the trace anomaly data . about @xmath109 of the total contribution to @xmath110",
    "is given by the lightest scalar @xmath111 and tensor @xmath112 glueball states , confirming the marginal role of the excited glueball spectrum as well as possible two - glueball resonances .",
    "the trace anomaly due to the glueballs reads @xmath113 at the lowest lattice temperature @xmath114 one has @xmath115 .",
    "this sets an upper bound since all contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : em3p - glueballs ] ) are positive . taking the known glueball spectrum one gets @xmath116 .",
    "however , the steep raise below @xmath13 is not reproduced by the glueball spectrum , basically due to the heavy values of the masses . in this context",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that above the phase transition glueballs lower their masses providing an enhancement already below the phase transition . the behaviour and effect of glueballs in the deconfined phase has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "note also that the glueball gas formula neglects glueball interactions which are nominally @xmath117 .",
    "assuming that the multiplicity in the glueball spectrum is @xmath118 this yields a trace anomaly @xmath119 for @xmath120 , while we clearly have @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "further considerations on the glueball spectrum and its possible hagedorn structure are presented in appendix [ subsec:4.c ] . in all",
    ", our analysis above explains why the pressure of finite mass glueballs is compatible with zero within errors both from the trace anomaly lattice calculation as well as from the direct glueball spectrum estimate , and hence supports the infinite mass glueball assumption underlying the model of ref .",
    "the weak coupling expansion for the free energy of the quark - gluon plasma has been calculated through order @xmath123  @xcite , and the result yields poor convergence at the lattice qcd available temperatures @xmath124 , and even at much higher temperatures .",
    "the problem is more involved taking into account that at order @xmath125 starts the contribution of non perturbative effects which is hard to compute  @xcite .",
    "there have also been numerous attempts to resum perturbation theory in order to get a better convergence of the result ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most developed techniques is the hard thermal loop ( htl ) perturbation theory , first proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this is an efficient reorganization of the perturbative series which avoids the unpleasant infrared singularities .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : e3p_1 ] the two - loop result for the trace anomaly density from htl  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a one loop computation ) .",
    "the htl result becomes a very smooth function in the regime @xmath126 and is unable to reproduce the lattice data .",
    "one of the most conspicuous facts is that the pressure from htl remains nearly constant with a value of about @xmath127 of that of an ideal gas of gluons , even for temperatures @xmath128 .",
    "this means that the approach to the ideal gas is extremely slow , which ultimately implies that the trace anomaly is very small and smooth .",
    "the same feature is shared by the weak coupling expansion and other resummation techniques , and it seems to be confirmed by preliminary results of lattice computations at extremely high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "many perturbative studies based on the computation of the three - dimensional effective theory of qcd on the lattice lead once again to the same smooth behaviour for the trace anomaly even near @xmath13  @xcite .    these problems can be understood within our framework by noting that perturbation theory , as well as htl and other resummation techniques , contain only logarithms in the temperature , suggesting a mild temperature dependence .",
    "our discussion above shows that these approaches would yield a powerless contribution , @xmath129 , which should ultimately be identified with the _ almost _ constant and vanishing @xmath110 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) rather than with the full result from the lattice .",
    "actually , the maximum lattice temperature @xmath130 should be far from the pqcd estimate since the power correction provides the bulk of the full result at this temperature .",
    "for @xmath131 the @xmath132 corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : e3ppt ] ) corresponds to multiply it by @xmath133  @xcite which becomes small for @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "this delayed onset of perturbative qcd is not a new phenomenon and takes place in the study of exclusive processes at high energies where there appear collinear divergences ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in order to support this statement , we zoom in fig .  [ fig : e3p_3 ] the two - loop result for the trace anomaly density in htl and compare it with our value @xmath136 from a fit of lattice data using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , estimated in the continuum limit .",
    "the htl result is inside the error band for temperatures @xmath137 . from a fit of @xmath138 lattice data we got @xmath139 , and the htl result is inside the error band for @xmath140 .",
    "it is appropriate to mention at this point that the estimated error of the 2-loop htl start to be important below @xmath141 as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : e3p_3 ] . moreover below @xmath141",
    "the 1-loop and 2-loop computations in htl start to be in disagreement  @xcite .",

    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "power corrections have also been obtained in the equation of state of full qcd  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless we will focus in this paper only on pure gluodynamics for simplicity .",
    "the conclusion of the above discussion is that the behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) clearly contradicts perturbation theory which contains no powers but only logarithms in the temperature .",
    "power corrections are understood as the high energy trace of non - perturbative low energy effects .",
    "this kind of corrections have already been detected and analyzed in the polyakov loop and in the heavy quark - antiquark free energy in terms of dimension two gluon condensates  @xcite .",
    "the rather successful description of the lattice data for the trace anomaly suggests a similar approach for the equation of state , that will be analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dim2ctraceanomaly ] .",
    "our previous numerical analysis of lattice data suggests that the perturbative series of the free energy of a hot gluon plasma is rather small , not only in the high temperature limit , but also near the deconfined phase .",
    "the perturbative series has a problem of convergence for temperatures below @xmath142 , which could mean a lack of analyticity near the phase transition .",
    "we can improve the convergence by considering a resummation of the perturbative series based on renormalization group invariance .",
    "the details of the computation are provided in appendix  [ app:3 ] . in practice",
    "this means to reorganize the perturbative series and express it in terms of the following manifestly renormalization group ( rg ) invariant @xmath143 the result for the pressure so obtained is a manifestly rg invariant series up to order @xmath144 and is given by eq .",

    "we allow both @xmath145 and @xmath154 to change as free parameters . in this form",
    "no acceptable fit is achieved .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "it mimics the overall shape of the data but fails to reproduce the highest temperature data , where perturbation theory ( pt ) is expected to be more reliable .",
    "in addition , this best fit requires unphysical values of @xmath157 , which would not reproduce other gluodynamics data . to avoid this problem , in what follows we fix @xmath154 to lie on the range @xmath158 , allowing for a @xmath159 uncertainty in this parameter . in this case , fitting @xmath145 in order to reproduce the highest temperature data , one can verify that the @xmath160 rapidly deteriorates as new lower temperature data are being included in the fit , while simultaneously the fitted value of @xmath145 rapidly changes to larger negative values .",
    "next we proceed to add the non perturbative ( np ) term @xmath161 to the perturbative ones and try to reproduce the data using @xmath145 and @xmath48 as parameters . in a more detailed treatment one should expect some interference between these contributions , from radiative corrections in the form of anomalous dimension , etc , in the np term .",
    "presently , we adopt the simplest scenario of additive pt and np contributions , i.e. we consider @xmath162 this procedure yields a fairly good fit to the data , @xmath163 , with @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( see fig .",

    "the error bars in @xmath48 and @xmath145 are enhanced as they include the uncertainty in @xmath154 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the two parameters are highly correlated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ellipse ] ) , and in fact the combination @xmath166 ( which has zero correlation with @xmath48 ) has a much smaller error",
    ". nevertheless , we caution that these numbers are to be taken as indicative only .",
    "the missing terms in the perturbative expansion make the perturbative contribution to be little reliable at temperatures near the transition .",
    "for instance , if the previous fit is repeated using data in the range @xmath167 , the central value of @xmath48 increases to @xmath168 while @xmath145 changes correspondingly .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the central value of @xmath145 is such the @xmath129 falls on top of the 2-loop htl calculation . actually , the value of @xmath145 required to produce this match between the two perturbative calculations at @xmath169 is @xmath170 ( note that this latter number does not depend on lattice trace anomaly data ) .",
    "similar values , @xmath171 , allow to reproduce the htl result by @xmath129 in the range @xmath172 with @xmath173 ( where we include the uncertainty from @xmath154 and from the scale @xmath174 in htl ) . while the central values of @xmath145 obtained from a fit to lattice data , including the np term , and to 2-loop htl are equal ( @xmath175 ) , the uncertainty assigned from the second determination is much smaller .",

    "it is important to emphasize that the non - triviality of such a numerical consistency can only be addressed in a calculation where all quantities can be estimated simultaneously .",
    "in addition , it would be worrisome if the dimension two condensate associated with the power correction would differ by an order of magnitude . the fact that this is by far not the case suggests searching for other features where the condensate might generate further genuinely non - perturbative thermal power corrections .",
    "this of course applies not only to gluodynamics but also to the case of full qcd with active dynamical quarks and in the presence of a chemical potential .",
    "a possible guideline for future studies would be a simple minded extension of the power corrections ideas discussed in the present work .",
    "actually , most recent qcd calculations already confirm the ubiquitous @xmath17 behaviour of the trace anomaly density @xcite .    on a more methodological level ,",
    "let us remind that at high energies and zero temperature momentum power corrections are widely accepted and encode via condensates non - perturbative effects .",
    "for this situation the full machinery of qcd sum rules has been extensively developed and applied with recurrent success . while there is no reason why condensates should not be present at high temperatures as genuinely non - perturbative effects even after deconfinement , temperature power corrections above the phase transition are much less common and a more complete technology than that used in the present work would be most useful .",
    "in addition to the standard finite temperature complications one must also face the well known ambiguity on clear separation between perturbative effects from existing non - perturbative features . there is no doubt that this intricate theoretical problem should necessarily be addressed at some stage in the near future .    in spite of the overall numerical consistency found for the dimension two condensate",
    ", the physics underlying the generation of such a condensate , and ultimately the very appearance of thermal power corrections remains uncertain .",
