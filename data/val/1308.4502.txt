    "hexagonal @xmath0 presents ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism  @xcite and can be considered as the prototype of `` type i '' ferroelectric antiferromagnetic materials in which the details of the magnetoelectric coupling can be studied .",
    "despite numerous investigations since the pioneer work of yakel _ et al . _ in 1963  @xcite , the exact crystalline and magnetic structures are still under debate .",
    "the temperature of the ferroelectric ( fe ) transition is for example not completely clear .",
    "located by some authors at 920k  @xcite , recent x rays measurements proposed 1258k  @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are not fully understood and are possibly due to some changes in the oxygen deficiency when the sample is heated . despite these discrepancies ,",
    "we can try to summarize the knowledge of this ferroelectric transition as follows .",
    "( i ) a transition corresponding to a unit - cell tripling and a change in space group from centrosymmetric @xmath2 ( # 194 ) to polar @xmath3 ( # 185 ) is observed in this temperature range . in this respect",
    "@xmath0 is a typical example of an improper ferroelectric  @xcite , opening the field to the new concept of hybrid improper ferroelectricity  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) indeed , the symmetric group @xmath4 reduces to @xmath3 by a rotation of the @xmath5 polyhedra .",
    "a displacement of the yttrium atoms with respect to the manganese atoms along the c axis of the structure induces a * c * axis polarization  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) furthermore , a possible intermediate phase with the space group @xmath6 can be derived from group theory  @xcite , however it was not observed in the recent measurements  @xcite , neither confirmed by symmetry - mode analysis  @xcite .",
    "the authors rather observe some evidence for an iso - symmetric phase transition at about 920  k , which involves a sharp decrease in the estimated polarization .",
    "this transition correlates with several previous reports of anomalies in physical properties in this temperature region  @xcite , but is not really understood .    at @xmath7",
    ", @xmath0 undergoes a paramagnetic ( pm ) to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition .",
    "the magnetism arises from @xmath8 ions , in @xmath9 configuration , with spins equal to 2 ( high spin ) .",
    "neutrons diffraction measurements  @xcite showed that the structure is antiferromagnetic with moments in the * ab*-plane .",
    "following bertaut _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , muoz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , proposed for the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic order the @xmath10 ( totally symmetric ) irreducible representation of the @xmath3 group  ; this order corresponds to the@xmath11 order pictured in figure  [ fig : vw ] .",
    "more recently , a spin polarized analysis showed that the group is rather @xmath12 or @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "finally , in a second harmonic optical generation work , frhlich _ et al . _ rather concluded to a very different order associated with the @xmath14 magnetic group  @xcite  ; this order corresponds to the @xmath15 order pictured in figure  [ fig : vw ] .",

    "_ performed a full symmetry analysis , checking all possible irreducible representations for the magnetic ordering , brown and chatterji , as well as fiebig _",

    ", the polarization behaves as the density matrix and thus can only belong to the totally symmetric @xmath10 representation in groups with only one - dimensional irreducible representations .    * @xmath11 * + * @xmath16 * + * @xmath17 *    associated with the afm order , several authors reported a ferromagnetic ( fm ) component associated with a spin canting along the * c * direction .",

    "@xcite , a fm component disappearing at @xmath20 was later observed in neutrons scattering by one of us  @xcite .",
    "the controversy about the existence of such a component is thus still opened .",
    "one could argue that the weakness of the proposed canting removes most of the interest of its existence , however as we will see in the present paper the existence of a fm component has many consequences on the symmetry group of the magnetic structure as well as the interpretation of the @xmath0 properties .",
    "let us finally quote the existence of a giant magneto - elastic coupling observed by powder neutron diffraction at the magnetic transition  @xcite .",
    "very large atomic displacements ( up to 0.1  ) are induced by the magnetic ordering without any identified change of the symmetry group .",
    "the influence of such displacements on the polarization or dielectric constant in the magnetic phase was however never reported on single crystal ( such measurements exist in thin films ) while this information is crucial for the assertion of the assumed magneto - electric coupling seen by domain imaging using second harmonic generation measurements  @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims at building a coherent description for the magnetic structure of the @xmath0 compound , which will account for all the experimental observations and resolve their apparent contradictions .",
    "all the measurements reported in the present work were performed on the same single crystal , grown long time ago in groningen by g. nnert , from the group of t. palstra .",
    "the sample size for dielectric measurements is @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed with a qd mpms-5 squid magnetometer .",
    "dielectric and polarization measurements were respectively performed in a qd ppms-14 with agilent 4284a lcr meter and keithley 6517a .",
    "magnetic fields above 14 t ( and up to 25 t ) were achieved in the lncmi grenoble .",
    "the experimental setup for the dielectric constant measurements was the same as in caen , while the lncmi setup was used for the magnetization .",
    "antiferromagnetic neutron diffraction peaks were measured on 4f triple axis spectrometer in laboratoire lon brillouin in saclay on the same single crystal .",
    "we performed neutron scattering experiments on a neutron triple axis spectrometer and checked the crystal orientation and crystalline quality .",
    "the 100 magnetic peak is associated with the antiferromagnetic order parameter . on fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrons ] , the temperature dependence of its amplitude is reported , showing the magnetic transition at @xmath7 .",
    "on the same figure , we reported the * ab * component of the dielectric constant , @xmath24 , which presents an anomaly at @xmath20 .",
    "let us note that the * c * component of @xmath24 does not present any anomaly at this temperature ( not shown ) .",
    "the strong similarity , below @xmath20 , between the temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter , and the non linear part of @xmath24 , suggests that they are closely related , and thus infers the existence of a magneto - electric coupling .",
    "one should emphasize the fact that the anomaly of the dielectric constant is not a divergence as expected in the case of a linear magneto - electric coupling .",
    "this proof of a non - linear magneto - electric coupling is of utter importance as we will see in the next section .",
    "this magneto - electric coupling can also be asserted from the polarization and dielectric constant measurements in the magnetic phase .",
    "we performed polarization measurements along the * c*-axis ( the only one allowed by symmetry ) .",
    "a strong reduction of the polarization amplitude is observed below @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pol ] )  : @xmath25 at 30k , to be compared with the @xmath26 measured at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "these polarization values are compatible with the estimated ones , obtained both as @xmath27 and from our first principle calculations .",
    "we computed the polarization using density functional theory and a berry phases approach at the atomic structures given in reference   at 10k and 300k .",
    "the calculations were performed with the b1pw hybrid functionals that was specifically designed for the treatment of ferroelectric oxides  @xcite . at 300k",
    "we found a polarization of @xmath28 .",
    "in full agreement with experimental values . at 10k ,",
    "the polarization is strongly reduced to @xmath29 to be compared with the experimental result of @xmath30 at 30k .",
    "in addition , we measured the polarization versus the magnetic field . since this effect is expected to be very small , we used a procedure consisting in ramping many times the magnetic field from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and extracting the periodic signal from the raw data .",
    "one can see on @xmath33 taken in the magnetic phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polh ] ) an anomaly that can be associated with a meta - magnetic transition .",
    "this anomaly can also be followed on the dielectric constant , @xmath24 , as a function of applied field and temperature .",
    "the meta - magnetic transition phase diagram , characteristic of an antiferromagnetic compound under magnetic field , can so be built ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eps_h ] ) .",
    "\\(a ) +   + ( b ) +    the searched of the meta - magnetic transition is a classical method to observe the antiferromagnetism . indeed , in usual systems , the magnetization ( or magnetic susceptibility ) versus magnetic field presents an anomaly at the afm / fm transition under applied field . in @xmath0",
    "our ability to see this transition on electric degrees of freedom ( polarization and dielectric constant ) clearly proves the existence of a coupling between the polarization and the magnetic order parameter , as first proposed by huang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", one of us ( s. pailhs ) observed in a non - polarized neutrons scattering experiment , a bragg peak that was associated with a ferromagnetic component  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this bragg peak , at @xmath34 , can neither be associated with the antiferromagnetic order within the ( * a*,*b * ) plane , nor with the nuclear extinction rules , since for the @xmath3 symmetry group imposes @xmath35 .",
    "in addition it disappears at @xmath20 , as expected from a canted afm order .",
    "one objection can however be made against this interpretation .",
    "the existence of two @xmath36 layers per unit cell ( respectively at @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , forbids to rule out the possibility of an antiferromagnetic coupling between the * c * components of the canted magnetic moments of each layer ( @xmath39 versus @xmath17 order of figure  [ fig : vw ] ) .",
    "we thus performed precise magnetic measurements on a squid magnetometer at low magnetic field , and we did observe a small fm component ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fm ] ) .",
    "the sample was cooled down from 100k ( still above @xmath20 ) to 10k either under an applied magnetic field along the * c * axis of the crystal ( field cooled = fc ) or without any field ( zero field cooled = zfc ) . after cooling ,",
    "the magnetization was always measured ramping the temperature up under the applied field .",
    "this procedure , assuming that the applied field is too small to reverse the magnetization , clearly evidenced the existence of a ferromagnetic component along the * c * axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fm ] ) .",
    "the applied magnetic field is 0.05 t .",
    "let us summarize the facts we learned from experiments .",
    "* @xmath0 exhibits a magneto - electric coupling between the afm and the fe orders .",
    "* this magneto - electric coupling is non linear .",
    "the immediate consequence of this is that the afm order parameter can not be in the same irreducible representation than the fe order parameter , that is the polarization .",
    "the latter being in the totally symmetric irreducible representation  : @xmath10 , the afm order can not belong to the @xmath10 irreducible representation of the magnetic group .",
    "assuming that the magnetic order found by bertaut  @xcite and muoz  @xcite is correct , it means that the magnetic group is not @xmath3 as assumed by these authors .",
    "see @xmath11 of fig .",
    "[ fig : vw ] for a picture of this order .",
    "* there is a weak fm component along the * c * axis . * even if essentially quenched by the crystal field splitting of the mn @xmath40 orbitals , the spin - orbit coupling and thus the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya ( dm ) interaction always exists provided it is symmetry allowed . this is the case with the afm magnetic order @xmath11 found in neutrons scattering , since the spins vorticity is non nil .",
    "the dm interaction should thus induces a fm component ( even if small ) along the * c * direction . *",
    "finally the afm and fm order parameters are not linearly coupled .",
    "indeed , they present different behaviors around the transition ( see figure  7 of ref .   or figures  [ fig : neutrons ] and [ fig : fm ] of the present paper ) .    according to the above analysis",
    "the @xmath3 group can not be the system magnetic group .",
    "can we find a magnetic subgroup of the crystallographic group @xmath3 compatible with all the above experimental requirements ?",
    "the following symmetry group analysis tells us that only one magnetic group is compatible with ( i ) the @xmath11 afm order , ( ii ) the fact that this order is not in the @xmath10 irreducible representation and ( iii ) the existence of a fm component along the * c * direction .",
    "this group is the @xmath13 magnetic group .",
    "indeed , we first examined the magnetic groups associated with the @xmath3 crystallographic group , that is    @xmath3  : : :    discarded since the afm order @xmath11 belongs to    @xmath10 and the fm component @xmath17 is not    allowed ( does not belong to the same representation as    @xmath11 ) ; @xmath41  : : :    discarded since @xmath11 and @xmath17 do not belong    to the same representation ( fm component not allowed ) ; @xmath42  : : :    discarded since the fm component is not allowed ; @xmath43  : : :    discarded since the fm component is not allowed .    since none of them is compatible with the experimental requirements we looked further in their subgroups and thus abandoned the mirror planes .",
    "the @xmath44 group : :    was discarded since @xmath11 belongs to    @xmath10 , which is incompatible with the absence of a    linear magneto - electric coupling .",
    "finally the @xmath45 group : :    is the only group compatible with all the requirements .",
    "let us remember that the @xmath13 magnetic group was strongly suggested by brown and chatterji  @xcite from the polarimetric study of neutron diffraction .",
    "in fact , they were the first to suggest that the mirror planes are incompatible with the @xmath46 magnetic group .",
    "let us now see whether we can account for all the experimental results in a landau analysis .",
    "we established that the magnetic transition should be a transition between the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase belonging to the @xmath3 group , and the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase belonging to the @xmath13 group . in the @xmath13 group the @xmath47 irreducible representation , to whom both the afm ( @xmath11 ) and the fm ( @xmath17 ) order parameters belong , is three times represented , namely by the @xmath11 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the landau theory must thus involve all three magnetic order parameters in addition to the change in the ferroelectric polarization . @xmath11 and @xmath16 are easily represented by the toroidal ( @xmath48 ) and divergence ( @xmath49 ) components of the in - plane spins component , while @xmath17 is the out of plane component associated with the magnetization ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "for each unit cell one can thus define @xmath51 where the summations over @xmath52 run over the six mn atoms of the unit cell  ; the @xmath53 refer to the in plane components of the mn atoms position vectors ( note that @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the in - plane component of the mn spins and @xmath57 is the * c * axis component ) .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath50 are vectors along the * c * direction while @xmath49 is a scalar .",
    "let use write @xmath58 and @xmath59 and point out that the intensity of the 100 afm magnetic peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrons ] ) is proportional to @xmath60 whatever the angle @xmath61 . in the paramagnetic state ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , but the polarization @xmath64 is not zero .",
    "this is one of the important issue of this compound .",
    "@xmath65 is not a driving order parameter for the magnetic transition  ; however , since its value presents a singularity at @xmath20 , it is a secondary order parameter .",
    "its contribution should thus be taken into account in the landau free energy and can only contain even powers of @xmath64 , as imposed by the higher temperature paraelectric to ferroelectric transition .",
    "the free energy can thus be expressed up to the power 4 of the order parameters @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the temperature independent landau expansion coefficients . if one notes @xmath76 , and @xmath77 the gradient of the free energy writes as @xmath78    + z_4 \\ , \\cos{\\varphi}\\,m\\ ,    \\delta\\!p\\,(2p_0+\\delta\\!p ) = 0 \\\\[2ex ]     % % % % % % % % % %     \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\delta\\!p } & = &    ( p_0+\\delta\\!p ) \\left [ -2\\beta_2      + 4\\beta_4\\,({p_0}^2 + 2{p_0}\\delta\\!p   + { \\delta\\!p}^2 )       \\right .",

    "this , in addition to the presence of the small ferromagnetic component , implies that the only possible group is here @xmath13 . in this group ,",
