    ", we are here alluding to resummation procedures of perturbatively enhanced pure qcd contributions to physical cross - sections .",
    "these matters have come under systematic scrutiny by sterman and collaborators @xcite , following earlier realizations @xcite on the physical relevance of soft gluon radiation .    the wide acceptance of qcd as the microscopic theory of the strong interactions , despite the fact that its fundamental field quanta do not register as observed asymptotic states , rests largely on one s ability to isolate and identify its contribution to a given hadronic process by means of factorization theorems . with respect to the impact of ir properties of qcd on measurable quantities ,",
    "the studies conducted in @xcite , which commence at the hadronic level and methodically proceed to the microscopic one @xcite , encourage the idea to pursue ir issues through a direct reference to qcd , i.e. , through considerations which base themselves on the green s functions of the theory .",
    "recognizing , at the same time , the key role played by the parton model in connection with applications of qcd , we shall employ for its description a fock - feynman - schwinger @xcite , or equivalently worldline casting @xcite ( for recent reviews , we refer to @xcite ) , wherein a space - time interpretation  as opposed to a feynman diagrammatic one  of fundamental matter field quanta propagation is attained @xcite . in this way , one aspires to achieve consistency with the parton model mode of description without , however , invoking its probabilistic content .",

    "drell - yan ( dy ) and deep inelasting scattering ( dis ) , in particular .    for the ir domain of qcd , a central issue of concern is where the perturbative picture ends and to what extent non - perturbative effects start to become dominant ( for a review and references , we refer to @xcite ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the very concept of soft gluon radiation looses its meaning below some momentum scale of the order of @xmath2 ( recent discussions of these issues are given in @xcite ) .",
    "one consistent approach for attacking this problem strictly within the framework of the microscopic theory itself has been articulated by ciafaloni @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , our own considerations will rely upon the worldline casting of qcd , keeping a more pragmatic course and focusing our attention on cross - section expressions .",
    "one might reasonably wonder as what constitutes the innovative tool , provided by the worldline casting of qcd , that facilitates calculations which `` flirt '' with the edge of the perturbative domain of the theory .",
    "a direct answer _ can _ be given at this point though its full content will become more transparent through the main exposition in the sections to follow . in short ,",
    "it is the ability to isolate a special set of space - time paths having a very simple geometrical profile shared in a restricted ( but directly relevant to the physics of the process ) neighborhood by each and every contour entering the path integral .",
    "the single ( multiplicative ) renormalization constant carried by this special family of paths automatically factorizes their contribution to amplitudes / cross - sections given that it also accompanies the rest of the paths .",
    "the more complex geometrical structure of the latter simply implicates additional ultraviolet ( uv ) singularities which can be absorbed into conventional wave- function and coupling - constant renormalizations .",

    "letting these comments suffice for an introductory exposition , we now proceed to display the organization of this paper , which is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we exhibit the worldline expression for the full fermionic green s function and subsequently employ it to construct corresponding expressions both for dy and dis type qcd amplitudes / cross - sections .",

    "as it turns out @xcite , in the perturbative context , the structure of matter particle contours , entering the path integral , is determined by the points , where a momentum change takes place , i.e. , points where a gauge field line ( real or virtual ) attaches itself on the ( fermionic ) matter field path .",

    "then , such a requirement automatically isolates those contours , whose only significant geometrical characteristic is that the four - velocities to approach and depart from point @xmath13 are fixed , denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively ; the same , of course , happens for point @xmath30 , but in reverse order .",

    "the second alternative , to be labelled ( b ) , can be typically represented by @xmath57 that is equivalently effected via the condition @xmath58 .",
    "all in all , there are four different configurations : @xmath59 and prime@xmath60no - prime entering this case .",
    "we characterize case @xmath54 as `` uniformly soft '' , given that the considered gluon exchanges take place in a neighborhood whose smallness pertains to all directions .",
    "case @xmath61 , on the other hand , will be referred to as `` jet '' since gluon emission occurs under circumstances , where entrance and exit four - velocities differ between them significantly along one or the other of the light - cone directions .",
    "we point out that what here is termed as `` jet '' does not coincide with the notion of collins et al .",
    "the actual connection will become evident later on .",

    "the second term has the same structure ( it involves the exiting branch of @xmath20 ) and therefore produces a similar result : @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "a couple of remarks are in order at this point .",
    "first , even though the length scales @xmath68 and @xmath69 are both large , being proportional to @xmath51 , they will be of the same order of magnitude for case ( a ) , whereas for case ( b ) , one scale will be negligible in comparison with the other .",
    "accordingly , the total expression for the uniformly soft amplitude will be twice as large as that of the jet - like one .",
    "this being said , we shall denote the dominant length scale by @xmath70 and/or @xmath71 , when it enters our final expressions , and set it equal to @xmath72 , recognizing that it is of the same order as the ir cutoff .",
    "second , in order to avoid the double counting resulting from the fact that each branch has been `` cut - off '' at corresponding distances away from @xmath13 ( implying that gluon emission will occur at the endpoints to be offset by a similar one but opposite in sign from that portion of the contour that continues to stretch out to infinity ) , the final expressions for the amplitudes / cross - sections should be multiplied by a factor of 1/2 .",
    "equivalently , one might think of this compensation as actually identifying the missing energy of the gluon emission at the extremities with the off - mass - shellness .",
    "in fact , this is what we have been implying all along when claiming that finite contours signify off - mass - shellness .    turning our attention to the contribution resulting from a virtual gluon exchange from the entrance to the exit branch , with respect to @xmath13 , we consider the quantity @xmath73 for case @xmath54 it assumes the form ( recall that @xmath74 is negative for the dy and positive for the dis type of process ) @xmath75 as shown in the appendix , for dy , one determines ( @xmath76 is euler s constant ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 , while for dis ( @xmath79 ) @xmath80 in all of the above expressions , as well as in those that will follow , we have ignored : ( i ) all imaginary terms that will drop out when contributions ( for virtual gluons ) from the conjugate contour are taken into account and ( ii ) finite , @xmath81-independent terms that will cancel out when real - gluon contributions to the cross - section are included .",
    "collecting all terms , we deduce , for the `` uniformly smooth '' part , @xmath82 where the angle @xmath83 is to be adjusted either to the dy or the dis situation .    concerning the `` jet '' part of the computation , we only need to consider @xmath84 because ) . ] the expression for @xmath85 is simply one half of that of @xmath86 .",
    "a typical term entering @xmath84 @xmath87 is @xmath88 whose computation suffices to furnish each of the other three terms as well .",
    "it is shown in the latter part of the appendix that for either the dy or the dis type process one obtains @xmath89 subtracting the pole terms in the @xmath90 scheme , we arrive at the finite part of the overall result .",
    "for the uniformly soft contribution , in particular , we get @xmath91 while the jet contribution reads @xmath92 where we have set @xmath93 .",
    "the above relation takes into account all four different configurations contributing to @xmath84 .    putting everything together we arrive at the following overall result for the second order contribution stemming from contour @xmath20 @xmath94 .",

    "we have implicitly assumed the pre - confinement property , originally articulated in the first work of reference @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , according to which the non - perturbative dynamics responsible for confinement screens color up to the infrared scale @xmath133 which sets the lower limit for the perturbative regime .",
    "our analysis has been conducted via the adoption of the worldline casting of qcd whose emphasis on a space - time propagation content facilitates the isolation and eventually factorization of ir contributions to cross sections through eikonal - type paths . in this connection ,",

    "the present paper presents the first application of the worldline methodology to `` cross - sections '' in which real - gluon radiation effects must also be taken into account - and so far have received much less systematic treatment .",
    "the common renormalization - group running of virtual and real - uniformly soft and jet - type - gluon contributions to the cross - section has led to a final result in which the ir - cutoff momentum is provided by the inverse impact parameter which can be vested with concrete physical meaning related to the process itself .",
