    "plasma physics often employs simplified frameworks to explain properties of observed plasmas in solar , space , and astrophysics .",
    "prominent among these is the large class of calculations based upon linearization of a vlasov description about a uniform equilibrium magnetized state . a rich variety of normal modes and wave damping rates emerge , even when each plasma species possesses simple properties such as maxwellian distributions with isotropic temperatures .",
    "the dependence of these modes on species plasma betas and other dimensionless parameters is a familiar and important topic in space plasma physics and astrophysics .",
    "more complex distribution functions that admit temperature anisotropy or beams are familiar in low collisionality solar wind , accretion disks , and galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these features provide free energy for families of instabilities such as the firehose , alfvn ion cyclotron , and mirror mode instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the characteristic timescales ( or reciprocal frequencies ) of the relevant linear vlasov modes typically extend over a very wide range .    intriguingly , many plasmas of interest  including the solar wind , corona , and interstellar medium  also exhibit properties of a turbulence cascade extending from larger magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) to smaller kinetic spatial scales .",
    "cascades also can extend over a wide range of timescales .",
    "the present paper compares _",
    "linear vlasov timescales _ and _ nonlinear turbulence timescales _ as the associated length scales approach the transition between mhd and kinetic regimes .",
    "we have in mind the specific case of the solar wind , for which it is possible to inform the discussion using analytical estimates , simulations , and direct observational analysis .",
    "we will conclude that nonlinear and linear inverse timescales can be comparable , with frequencies of order of @xmath0 to @xmath1 the proton gyrofrequency , for the oblique wavevectors thought to dominate solar wind fluctuations . therefore caution is required in applying the static equilibrium assumptions underlying much of linear theory .",
    "finally we close with a suggestion for a simple dimensionless measure of the degree of turbulence cascade effects on kinetic processes . note",
    "that throughout the presentation we avoid committing to a specific dynamical model of the spectrum , such as reduced mhd , two - dimensional mhd or goldreich  sridhar theory @xcite , in order to maintain as broad a context as possible ; however some issues related to anisotropic spectral models are discussed in appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "from a technical perspective , linearization leads to small amplitude solutions having exponential behavior @xmath2 with complex frequencies @xmath3 consisting of real frequency @xmath4 and a growth ( @xmath5 ) or damping rate ( @xmath6 ) . in general ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions of the wavevector @xmath9 , not just its magnitude @xmath10 .",
    "linearization about a uniform state yields normal modes of the plasma .",
    "these are generally transient @xcite , but some have small damping rates @xmath11 with @xmath12 . besides damped waves , relevant instabilities are studied in linear vlasov calculations by perturbing about a simple plasma configuration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a typical unstable equilibrium might have uniform density and magnetic field @xmath13 , with free energy supplied by an anisotropic particle distribution function .    to discuss a range of relevant timescales for normal modes , it is convenient to adopt a normalization that expresses timescales in units of the proton gyrofrequency @xmath14 , in terms of a characteristic magnetic field strength @xmath15 , and length in units of the ion inertial scale @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the plasma frequency , @xmath18 the light speed , @xmath19 the mass density , and @xmath20 the alfvn speed .",
    "kinetic scales will be indicated when @xmath21 or greater , while short timescales , @xmath22 , are indicated by @xmath23 or less .",
    "the actual values of the frequencies associated with waves and instabilities are obtained either by numerical solutions of the full dispersion equation @xcite or through analytic approximations @xcite .",
    "when the relatively low - frequency mhd waves  alfvn and fast and slow magnetosonic waves  are extended to a kinetic description , one finds in linear vlasov theory that the magnetosonic waves are much more heavily damped @xcite than the alfvn mode for relevant parameters .",
    "this damping is often invoked as a basic physical explanation for frequently observed fluctuations that resemble the alfvn waves in the inner heliosphere @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to describing normal modes that may be present in the kinetic range of solar wind turbulence , where there is a well - known observed dominance of quasi - two dimensional wavevectors @xcite ; that is , perpendicular wavenumber @xmath24 parallel wavenumber @xmath25 . in the following sections we therefore emphasize discussion of the properties of oblique fluctuations that are likely to make up a substantial fraction of the solar wind fluctuation spectrum .    within this class",
    "a popular choice is the oblique kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) @xcite with wave frequencies @xmath26 low compared to the proton cyclotron frequency @xmath27 .",
    "recent observations also suggest that such low - frequency modes are energetically most relevant in the solar wind between the ion and electron inertial scales @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will focus here on wave properties approaching and near @xmath28 , and on wavevectors mainly in the oblique and quasi - two dimensional range of angles to the mean field , that is @xmath29 .",
    "figures  [ fig : waves ] , [ fig : sims ] , and [ fig : swdata ] portray this emphasis on oblique wavevectors by progressively shading the linear results in the more oblique range of angles .",
    "higher frequency waves may also be present , such as whistlers @xcite or alfvn ion cyclotron ( aic ) waves with quasi - parallel wavevectors , although these are generally thought to occur at a relatively lower amplitude and higher frequency .",
    "aic modes are particularly relevant in models involving pitch angle scattering @xcite .",
    "the observed frequencies and wavevectors of fluctuations near ion kinetic scales have been analyzed in terms of linear wave theory @xcite . due to the ambiguities inherent in these analyses ,",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn is that the observed fluctuations in about a decade of scale near @xmath21 are `` low - frequency '' and are consistent with a dominant contribution of kinetic alfvn waves with wavevectors lying in the range of 8589of the mean magnetic field .",

    "the _ damping _ rates of normal modes such as kaws are also relevant , for example in some theories of solar wind heating that invoke a balance between linear damping and cascade rate @xcite .",
    "linear damping rates have been computed and tabulated for both nearly parallel wavevectors @xcite as well as highly oblique orientations @xcite . damping rates for modes with wavenumber close to ion kinetic scales @xmath40 ( within a decade or so ) are frequently found to be of order @xmath41 to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this characteristic range of damping rates is found for a reasonably wide range of electron plasma beta and for ratios of ion to electron temperatures from zero to ten @xcite .",

    "various anisotropies drive a variety of instabilities [ gary , 1993 ] ; a source of free energy often observed in the solar wind is the @xmath49 proton temperature anisotropy .    under typical solar wind conditions , there are two distinct growing modes which arise as a result of this anisotropy : the proton mirror instability and the alfvn - cyclotron instability .",
    "the former has zero real frequency in a homogeneous plasma , has maximum growth rate @xmath50 at relatively oblique propagation ( @xmath51 ) , and is favored at relatively high values of @xmath52 .",
    "the latter mode satisfies @xmath53 , has maximum growth rate at @xmath54 , and is preferentially excited if @xmath55 . as the proton temperature anisotropy",

    "figure  [ fig : instabilities]a shows that this growth rate corresponds to @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the fluctuations that may be produced by proton - driven instabilities would be expected to have their maximum amplitudes at wavelengths near ( or slightly larger than ) the ion inertial scale , which typically marks the end of the inertial range spectrum , as discussed below .    summarizing these linear theory results , near the scales associated with onset of the kinetic physics range ( @xmath40 ) there are highly relevant waves with frequencies on the order of a few tenths of the cyclotron frequency or less , and associated damping rates of similar magnitude that may contribute to dissipation .",
    "likewise , temperature anisotropy - driven instabilities at limiting parameters in the solar wind are reported to have typical growth rates that are also less than a tenth of the cyclotron frequency .",

    "sufficiently strong nonlinearity drives a cascade that potentially influences dynamics across decades of scale . in the solar wind",

    "the cascade is also evidenced directly , by observation of third - order statistics @xcite .",
    "accompanying broadband spatial structure , a wide range of timescales also characterizes the cascade .",
    "these nonlinear timescales generally become smaller at smaller scales .",
    "this speed - up is important as it is responsible for the tendency of turbulence to attain quasi - universal small - scale statistical equilibria @xcite .",
    "the question at hand is whether , as the kinetic plasma range is approached in scale ( and at appropriate oblique angles to the mean magnetic field ) , the nonlinear timescales are competitive with timescales emerging from the linear processes summarized in the previous section .",
    "this comparison relates to the balance between cascade activity  mainly mediated by the nonlinear time ( see below , and appendix  [ app : a])and linear kinetic effects that occur independently at each wavevector without regard for cross - scale couplings .    for context , let us review the standard kolmogorov phenomenology for steady - state isotropic hydrodynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the relevant nonlinear timescale for a kolmogorov analysis of mhd becomes @xmath84 in direct analogy to eq .",
    "( [ taunlk ] ) .",
    "it is also straightforward to introduce modifications in the above reasoning to treat the anisotropic perpendicular mhd cascade that is obtained in the presence of a strong imposed mean magnetic field @xcite . for an assumed perpendicular cascade , the familiar procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to simply interpret the scale @xmath66 and the wavenumber @xmath69 as the projection onto the perpendicular plane .",
    "another potentially important timescale in describing the cascade is the alfvn crossing time .",
    "however for reasons outlined in appendix  [ app : a ] , we will base the following discussion of cascade timescales only on the nonlinear timescale .    moving into the realm of kinetic plasma dynamics",
    ", there is no generally accepted formulation of a nonlinear timescale , in contrast to the fluid regime .",
    "however we expect the same kind of hydrodynamic advective and line - stretching nonlinearities to be present in kinetic plasma .",
    "for @xmath85 there should also be effects of the hall current and other contributions to the generalized ohm s law , which would change the estimate of the nonlinear timescale from @xmath86 to something with a stronger dependence on @xmath74 , such as @xmath87 .",
    "the introduction of new timescales leads to the possibility of several different spectral scalings , an effect familiar in hall mhd or electron mhd turbulence studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "due to these complications ( as well as the practical matter of the lack of high - frequency velocity data ) , in the analysis below we will restrict estimates to the simplest local mhd nonlinear timescale .",
    "we expect that in the deep kinetic regime the mhd timescales will be upper bounds for the actual nonlinear timescales .",
    "however we will defer to a future study a more careful and detailed treatment of the @xmath88 nonlinear timescales .    with these caveats in mind , in all cases below we will estimate relevant nonlinear timescales by adopting the formulation given in eq .",

    "however the systems are not strictly controlled to be identical .",
    "for example the mean field strengths vary ( including no mean field for the 2d mhd case ) , and parameters such as hall parameter and mass ratio may differ .",

    "it is readily apparent that , in all cases , the nonlinear rates increase with @xmath101 , until a steepened dissipation range is encountered , whether a well - defined inertial range is seen , or not . in the various simulations",
    "one always finds that the slope of the nonlinear rate passes through a region in which it is similar to the kolmogorov value . as the dissipation range is approached , the spectral density of energy decreases more rapidly and the nonlinear rate levels off and usually decreases at very small scales .",

    "linear and nonlinear processes are concurrent in a dynamic plasma and comparison of their characteristic timescales is a useful basis for discussing their relative effects . for example , when the nonlinear timescales are extremely long compared to the timescales computed for linear processes , then one expects those linear processes to occur without immediate modification .",

    "it is apparent from fig .  [",
    "fig : swdata ] that at length scales approaching @xmath28 from above , the rate of local - in - scale nonlinear processes overtakes and then exceeds a number of the kinetic plasma processes that have received significant attention regarding solar wind plasma dispersion and dissipation in the kinetic range .",

    "[ fig : waves ] , [ fig : sims ] , and [ fig : swdata ] .",
    "this effect may not have received sufficient consideration previously .",
    "its implications , however , may differ subtly depending on which type of kinetic process is under consideration .    for _ linear waves _ , the influence of a fast nonlinear cascade is expected to modify the dynamical response of the system , i.e. , the activity at a specified wavevector . instead of being a simple oscillator with a characteristic frequency , one now has driving from larger scales , and damping by transfer of energy to smaller scales .",
    "so the problem becomes one of a stochastic nonlinear oscillator , which may exhibit behavior much different from simple harmonic motion .",
    "for example , random scrambling of a wave phase , even without energy change , causes a potentially dramatic frequency broadening @xcite . driving may also randomly change the energy content of the wave .",
    "clearly , linear couplings will remain present and under some conditions linear wave properties may play an important role .    turning to the _ damping rates _",
    ", the situation becomes somewhat different .",
    "when the cascade rate at a particular scale becomes larger than the linear vlasov damping rate @xmath92 , then the latter may become increasingly irrelevant .",
    "this may happen for example at a wavevector @xmath9 when the nonlinear time @xmath134 . in this case for quasi - steady cascade conditions ,",
    "most of the damping is due to dissipation not at @xmath9 , but in other ( smaller scale ) fluctuations .",
    "for example if the nonlinear cascade effect is much faster than linear damping of a particular kaw , then the energy may be transferred to much smaller scales and damped by other processes ( including possibly damping of whistlers ) .",
    "finally , _ instability calculations _ may need be modified to account for nonlinear rates that exceed standard instability growth rates .",
    "indeed it would seem that the problem of instability in a steady _ cascade _ becomes a perturbation about a driven dissipative steady - state , in contrast to one about an equilibrium .",
    "it is unclear whether the growth rates and other properties of usual mirror mode , aic , and firehose instabilities @xcite will be changed substantially , and further detailed work on specific cases will be required to address this question .",

    "it is noteworthy that the parameter @xmath159 that we suggest here as an indicator of the expected influence of cascade on linear kinetic processes is also closely related to the controlling parameters identified in studies of test particle energization in various contexts , including acceleration to high energies , anisotropic generation of suprathermal particles , and plasma heating @xcite .",

    ", we note that the present discussion has been based on a single nonlinear timescale that is _ characteristic _ of fluctuations at scale @xmath71 .",
    "two types of complications enter immediately in any more detailed treatments of timescales .",
    "one is that the notion of locality in scale that we borrow from kolmogorov theory applies to shells in wavevector space  that is , we associate a single nonlinear timescale to all wavevectors near a shell of wavenumber radius @xmath74 .",
    "thus , formulas for estimating @xmath94 such as eq .",
    "( [ taunlk ] ) or ( [ mhdtime ] ) involve the total energy near the shell , that is the energy density integrated over a thin shell of radius @xmath74 .",
    "this is a reasonable interpretation of locality even when the distribution of energy over the shell is anisotropic ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this necessarily involves averaging over regions ( directions ) on the shell that may have very different energy levels and spectral transfer properties .",
    "nonlocal transfer and its associated timescales may be even more complex .",
    "we avoid all such theoretical complications here in an effort to elucidate the basic physical timescale competition between linear and nonlinear effects .",
    "another underlying complication is that the characteristic timescale is only an average measure of the time variations at wavevector @xmath160 . in reality",
    "we know that time variations are broadband at each scale when nonlinear effects are strong . stated another way , in turbulence the frequency ( @xmath4 ) spectra @xmath161 admit power over a broad range of frequency @xmath91 for a given wavevector @xmath9 , as seen for example in a variety of fluid , mhd , and plasma simulations @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear timescale employed here is a standard estimate of the average effect due to local couplings for fluctuations in the inertial range",
    ". a more detailed treatment of the distribution of energy over timescales ( or frequencies ) would require examination of dynamical models in more detail than is warranted here .",

    "@xmath172 parallel to @xmath173 , this timescale can be much shorter than the corresponding nonlinear time @xmath174 and can in principle influence spectral transfer @xcite .",
    "however due to the usual dominant contribution of _ resonant triads _ to the nonlinear couplings @xcite , the greatest contributions to nonlinear spectral transfer are independent of @xmath175 . in this regard",
    "it is crucial to recall that the wavelike couplings themselves make no contribution to spectral transfer .",
    "rather the physics of alfvnic wavelike couplings may be understood as mainly suppressing parallel spectral transfer , giving rise to spectral anisotropy @xcite , but generally not having a major effect on the total rate at which spectral transfer occurs .",
