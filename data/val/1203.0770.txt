    "in the last three decades since a seminal work of benzi _ et .",
    "@xcite , extensive studies have been made on the stochastic resonance ( sr ) ( for a recent review on sr , see refs .",
    "theoretical studies on sr were made initially with the use of the overdamped langevin model subjected to white noise .",
    "it has been shown that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of nonlinear systems to a small periodic signal is resonantly enhanced under some optimum level of noise , whose effect is called sr @xcite .",
    "the resonant activation occurs when the frequency of an applied periodic signal is near the kramer escape rate of the transition from one potential minimum to another .",
    "subsequent studies on sr examined effects of colored noise ( for a review on colored noise , see ref .",
    "calculations with the use of the universal colored - noise approximation ( ucna ) @xcite have shown that noise color suppresses sr monotonically with increasing its relaxation time @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite has claimed that when @xmath2 is increased , the sr is first suppressed for small @xmath2 but enhanced for large @xmath2 with the minimum at intermediate @xmath2 . in recent years",
    ", studies on sr have been made by using more sophisticated noise : correlated additive white noise and multiplicative colored noise @xcite .",
    "snr of the langevin model subjected to such noises is shown to exhibit a complicated behavior as functions of magnitudes of additive and multiplicative noises and the correlation strength between the two noises @xcite .",
    "for example , snr may have the bimodal structure when these parameters are varied .",
    "it should be noted that langevin equations having been adopted for studies on sr are phenomenological ones which have some deficits such that a lack of the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) , related discussion being given in sec .",
    "we expect that in almost all real , non - isolated systems , the environment acts as a thermal bath which is a source of noise .",
    "the microscopic origin of additive noise has been proposed within a framework of caldeira - leggett ( cl ) system - bath hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the cl model with a linear system - bath coupling leads to the non - markovian langevin equation where memory kernel and noise term are expressed in terms of bath variables and they satisfy the fdr @xcite .",
    "the fdr implies that dissipation and diffusion come from the same origin . by using the generalized cl model including a nonlinear system - bath coupling ,",
    "we may obtain the non - markovian langevin equation with multiplicative noise which preserves the fdr @xcite . the nature of nonlinear dissipation and multiplicative noise has been recently explored with renewed interest @xcite .",
    "nonlinear dissipation and multiplicative noise have been recognized as important ingredients in several fields such as mesoscopic scale systems @xcite and ratchet problems @xcite .",
    "quite recently , we have studied the generalized cl model for a harmonic oscillator which includes nonlinear nonlocal dissipation and multiplicative diffusion @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the stationary probability distribution function ( pdf ) is independent of magnitudes of additive and multiplicative noises and of the relaxation time of colored noise @xcite , although the response to applied input depends on noise parameters @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with previous studies @xcite which show that the stationary pdf of the langevin model for the harmonic potential is gaussian or non - gaussian , depending on magnitudes of additive and multiplicative noises .",
    "we expect that when the generalized cl model with a nonlinear coupling @xcite is applied to a bistable system , properties of the calculated sr may be rather different from those having been derived by the phenomenological langevin models @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to make a detailed study on sr of an open bistable system described by the microscopic , generalized cl model with nonlinear nonlocal dissipation and state - dependent diffusion @xcite .",
    "although the ucna has been employed in many studies on sr for colored noise @xcite because it is exact both for @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , its validity within @xmath5 is not justified @xcite . in this study , we investigate sr for a wide range of @xmath2 value by simulations . the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly summarize the non - markovian langevin equation derived from the generalized cl model with ou colored noise @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , after studying the stationary pdf , we investigate sr of an open bistable system for three cases : additive noise , multiplicative noise , and coexisting additive and multiplicative noises . in sec .",
    "iv , we examine a validity of the markovian langevin equations with the local approximation , which have been widely employed in previous studies on sr @xcite .",
    "v is devoted to our conclusion .",
