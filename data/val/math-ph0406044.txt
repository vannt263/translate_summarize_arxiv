    "network models of quantum localisation were first introduced by chalker and coddington@xcite to model the transition between plateaux in integer quantum hall systems . reduced to their essentials",
    ", they describe the propagation of a single quantum - mechanical particle along the directed edges and through the nodes of a graph . for the chalker - coddington model",
    ", this graph is some large but bounded domain of the l - lattice , a square lattice whose edges are directed in such a way that the particle turns through @xmath2 at each node . in propagating along each edge ,",
    "the single - component wave function is multiplied by random phases , which are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with a uniform distribution in @xmath3 .",
    "the propagation through each node is described by a unitary @xmath4 @xmath1-matrix of amplitudes between the two incoming and two outgoing edges .",
    "the integer quantum hall plateau transition is only one among several possible universality classes of quantum localisation transitions , which have been classified by altland and zirnbauer@xcite according to the symmetry properties of the underlying single - particle hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "another , known as class c , corresponds to the existence of a symmetry @xmath6 this gives rise to a pairing between eigenstates with energies @xmath7 , while @xmath8 is special and may correspond to delocalised eigenstates , even in two dimensions .",
    "class c is supposed to be realised in disordered spin - singlet superconductors in which time - reversal symmetry is broken , but zeeman splitting is negligible@xcite .",
    "the fact that spin is still conserved can then lead to a spin quantum hall effect .",
    "the appropriate network model for this on the l - lattice was formulated and studied numerically by kagalovsky et al@xcite .",
    "an equivalent spin - chain hamiltonian was also investigated by senthil et al@xcite . however , in a remarkable paper , gruzberg , ludwig and read@xcite showed that the mean single - particle green function , as well as the mean conductance , may be expressed in terms of _ classical _ averages of appropriate observables of the hulls ( boundaries ) of clusters in classical bond percolation on the square lattice .",
    "the critical exponents@xcite and some other universal properties@xcite of the spin quantum hall transition in two dimensions are thus exactly known . _ _    the methods of gruzberg et al@xcite used supersymmetry to average over quenched disorder .",
    "one of the essential features of this , which will also appear in our analysis , is the reduction of the hilbert space on each edge to one of finite dimension .",
    "they then analysed the transfer matrix for the l - lattice , and demonstrated its equivalence to that for percolation hulls .",
    "one of the interesting features of percolation hulls on the square lattice is that they may be generated , independently of the underlying percolation problem , as history - dependent random walks on the l - lattice . consider a random walk which begins on some edge , and steps through one node in unit time . at each node it turns to the left or right with probabilities @xmath9 or @xmath10 respectively .",
    "however , it can not traverse a given edge more than once , so that whenever it returns to a node it has already visited it is forced to exit along the other ( empty ) edge .",
    "eventually , on a closed graph , it will return to its initial edge .",
    "the statistical properties of such loops are identical to those of a single closed hull in the percolation problem . on the l - lattice in the thermodynamic limit , when @xmath11 , loops close almost surely after a finite number of steps .",
    "this corresponds to quantum localisation in the network model .",
    "the only delocalised states occur when @xmath12 , at the bond percolation threshold .    motivated by this work , beamond , cardy and chalker@xcite investigated class c network models on arbitrary graphs .",
    "their methods did not use supersymmetry .",
    "instead they showed that , for quantities like the average green function @xmath13 and the mean conductance ( related to @xmath14 ) , there is a massive cancellation between paths in the feynman expansion of these quantities which leaves essentially classical paths whose weights correspond to those of a history - dependent random walk .",
    "this reproduces the results of gruzberg et al@xcite when specialised to the l - lattice .",
    "however , the proof of beamond et al@xcite was restricted to graphs in which each node has @xmath15 incoming and outgoing directed edges .",
    "it becomes too cumbersome to generalise it to graphs with nodes with @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , it seems important to find such a generalisation in order to be able to investigate , for example , the properties of such network models on simple regular lattices embedded in three or more dimensions .",
    "in this paper , we find this generalisation .",
    "like gruzberg et al@xcite , we use supersymmetry to perform the quenched average .",
    "however , we do this within a path integral , rather than a hilbert space , formulation of the model , which allows for the treatment of an arbitrary graph , not only those regular lattices which admit a transfer matrix .",
    "the result is positive , in the sense that we can prove that the mean of @xmath13 and of @xmath14 may be expressed as a sum of history - dependent classical random walks on the graph .",
    "the weights at each node , given that a given set of incoming edges is occupied by the walk , when summed over all possible outcomes , correctly sum to unity . however , in general these weights are not positive , and therefore can not be interpreted as probabilities .",
    "in fact we show that , for @xmath16 , this condition can only be satisfied if a certain number of elements of @xmath1 vanish .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is that the @xmath1-matrix at each node is a direct product of @xmath1-matrices for @xmath17 nodes , that is , the node may be decomposed into @xmath17 nodes ( in which case , of course , the analysis of beamond et al@xcite applies . ) for @xmath18 and @xmath19 we have shown that this condition is also necessary .    despite this negative result , the proof of the general theorem sheds further light on the analysis of gruzberg et al@xcite , as well as giving a more elegant derivation of beamond et al@xcite .",
    "these methods may also be used to determine which combinations of averages of higher - point green functions in the network model may be related to observables in the classical problem , thus giving a simpler derivation of some of the results of mirlin , evers , and mildenberger@xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the network models and the observables of interest",
    ". then we are able to state our main theorems ( 1 and 2 ) . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the path integral machinery necessary to compute these observables , and to perform quenched averages .",
    "the supersymmetric path integral involves both bosonic ( commuting ) and fermionic ( anticommuting ) variables on each edge , but after the quenched average is taken we show that these reduce to the propagation of only single fermion - fermion or boson - fermion pairs . in sec .",
    "iv we then show that the propagation of a fermion - fermion pair through the lattice obeys the rules of a classical history - dependent random walk , once all the other degrees of freedom are traced out .",
    "this proves theorem 1 .",
    "we also consider the case of open systems , and conductance measurements . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we consider the probabilistic interpretation in terms of history - dependent random walks , and prove theorem 4 which states conditions under which these weights are non - negative .",
    "let @xmath20 be a graph consisting of @xmath21 directed edges , and nodes .",
    "initially we consider only closed graphs . at each node",
    "there is an equal number of incoming and outgoing directed edges .",
    "apart from this , @xmath22 is arbitrary .",
    "we wish to define a network model on this graph with describes the propagation of a quantum - mechanical particle whose hamiltonian @xmath5 obeys the symmetry ( [ symm ] ) .",
    "first we note that the single - particle hilbert space must be even - dimensional in order to be able to define the action of @xmath23 . for simplicity",
    "we take this to be two - dimensional ( in @xcite a method was proposed for reducing any class c network model with an even - dimensional single - particle hilbert space to this case . )",
    "since the network describes propagation over finite time steps @xmath24 , we need to define the unitary evolution operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 which evolve the wave function along each edge and node respectively . by ( [ symm ] )",
    ", they must obey @xmath27 .",
    "each @xmath25 , therefore , must be an element of sp(2)@xmath28su(2 ) .",
    "we take these to be i.i.d .",
    "random variables , each uniformly distributed with respect to the haar measure of su(2 )",
    ". quenched averages with respect to this measure will be denoted by an overline .",
    "@xmath26 is the unitary @xmath1-matrix for the node @xmath29 .",
    "as will become clear , it suffices to take this to be diagonal in the su(2 ) indices , so , by the above , it must be real and therefore an element of o@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of incoming ( and outgoing ) edges at the node .",
    "the @xmath26 may vary from node to node , and in principle they may also be random variables .",
    "however , our theorems apply to a fixed realisation of these @xmath1-matrix elements .",
    "the full unitary evolution operator @xmath32 for the whole network is then a direct sum over the edges and nodes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "of interest is the green function , which is the matrix element of the resolvent operator @xmath35 between states localised on two edges : @xmath36 this is a @xmath4 matrix in su(2 ) space . for @xmath37 this may be expanded as a sum of feynman paths on @xmath20 beginning at @xmath38 and ending at @xmath39 : each path is weighted by an ordered product of su(2 ) matrices @xmath25 along the edges is traverses , and a product of @xmath1-matrix elements according to how it passes through each node , as well as a factor @xmath40 raised to the power of its length . however",
    ", each edge may be traversed an arbitrary number of times .",
    "if we were to formulate the sum over such paths using a transfer matrix formalism ( assuming that @xmath22 allows this ) , the hilbert space on each edge would be infinite - dimensional .    alternatively , for @xmath41 , we may write the resolvent as @xmath42 and expand @xmath13 in powers of @xmath43 , as a similar sum over paths . each path",
    "is now weighted by an ordered product of factors @xmath44 , as well as an overall factor of @xmath45 .",
    "the green function may be used to compute the density of states of @xmath46 via its diagonal elements @xmath47 . for a closed graph , these are of the form @xmath48 .",
    "we define the density of states @xmath49",
    ". then @xmath50    an open system may be defined by cutting open a subset of the edges of @xmath20 .",
    "we may then perform a conductance measurement by attaching leads to a subset @xmath51 of the incoming edges , and to a subset @xmath52 of the outgoing edges .",
    "the transmission matrix @xmath53 between these two leads has elements @xmath54 , and the conductance is then given by the landauer formula as @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , the point conductance between two edges is @xmath56 .",
    "the above defines the quantum problem which we wish to study .",
    "our main theorems will relate it to a classical problem , defined as follows . for each node in @xmath20 , adopt an arbitrary but fixed labelling of the incoming edges @xmath57 and outgoing edges @xmath58 , and denote the elements of the corresponding @xmath1-matrix by @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 , with the sign being dependent on the choice of labelling .",
    "@xmath61 on @xmath20 as a sequence of distinct edges @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are incoming and outgoing edges of the same node , for each @xmath65 .",
    "it is a ( rooted ) closed trail if @xmath66 and @xmath38 also share the same node .",
    "note that a trail can not pass along a given edge more than once , but it may pass through a given node any number of times , up to its order . _",
    "_    for a particular trail @xmath61 , and a particular node @xmath29 , denote the set of incoming edges on @xmath61 by @xmath67 , and the set of outgoing edges by @xmath68 .",
    "these are both _ ordered _ subsets of @xmath69 . a given trail associates an element of @xmath68 with each element of @xmath67 , and vice versa , and",
    "thus may be associated with a permutation @xmath70 of the ordered elements of @xmath67 .",
    "denote the signature of this by @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the minor of @xmath1 restricted to the ordered subsets @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the outgoing and incoming channels respectively . _ _",

    "( [ weight ] ) is a generalisation of the main result of @xcite , which applies to the case @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", the elements of @xmath1 may be taken to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 . if @xmath86 and @xmath87 , or if @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the weight is @xmath90 . if @xmath86 and @xmath89 , or if @xmath88 and @xmath87 , it is @xmath91 .",
    "but if @xmath92 and @xmath93 or @xmath94 , it is unity .",
    "the next theorem gives the equivalent result for conductance measurements .",
    "* theorem 2 . *",
    "_ the mean point conductance @xmath95 between two edges @xmath96 and @xmath97 is given by twice the sum over all open trails on @xmath20 connecting the two edges , each such path being weighted as for the closed loops in theorem 1 .",
    "_    thus , if the weights on the trails can be interpreted as a probability measure , the mean conductance between two contacts is just twice the expected number of open trails which connect them .",
    "the weight for a single trail @xmath61 is given by a product of weights corresponding to each node thorough which @xmath61 passes , once the whole of @xmath61 is given .",
    "alternatively , we may build up these weights as a product of factors incurred each time @xmath61 passes through a given node .",
    "for example , the first time it passes through , entering via edge @xmath98 and leaving by edge",
    "@xmath99 it incurs a weight , according to ( [ weight ] ) , of @xmath100 .",
    "if it passes though the same node again , this time entering along @xmath101 and leaving along @xmath102 , it then incurs a conditional weight .",
    "if the conditional weight can be interpreted as a probability , @xmath103 and therefore it has a finite limit as @xmath104 .",
    "even if this is not the case , the unconditional weight @xmath105 vanishes in this limit . ]",
    "@xmath106 and so on . in general @xmath107 the next theorem states that these conditional weights are properly normalised , in the sense that they give unity when summed over all possible outcomes :    * theorem 3 .",
    "* _ the weights @xmath108 satisfy @xmath109 _",
    "thus , as long as they are non - negative , they define a set of transition probabilities for a discrete random process whereby the ensemble of trails may be dynamically generated with the correct weights , the trail growing by one unit at each time step . since the weights at a given node depend on whether ( and how ) it has been visited in the past , the process may be thought of as a history - dependent random walk .",
    "when all nodes have @xmath15 , this is straightforward : the first time @xmath61 passes through a given node , it incurs a factor @xmath90 or @xmath91 . if it passes through a second time , this factor is unmodified .",
    "we may ask whether this positivity can extend to nodes with @xmath110 . to answer this ,",

    "_ _    * theorem 4 . * _ at a node with @xmath110 , a sufficient condition for the weights ( [ weight ] ) to be all non - negative is that the @xmath1-matrix is completely reducible . for @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "this is also necessary .",
    "_ thus , in these cases , the network model on @xmath20 could have been described on an equivalent graph with only @xmath15 nodes .",

    "the notation is a little complicated , but the basic idea is simple .",
    "label each end of a given directed edge @xmath79 by @xmath121 and @xmath122 , in the direction of propagation @xmath123 .",
    "introduce complex integration variables @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which are each 2-component column vectors in su(2 ) space , their components being labelled @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively , where @xmath128 .",
    "then @xmath13 can be written as @xmath129[d{b}_r(e)]{b}_l(e_2){b}_l^{\\dag}(e_1)\\,e^{w_b } \\over \\int\\prod_e[d{b}_l(e)][d{b}_r(e)]\\,e^{w_b}}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 with @xmath131 and the integration is wrt the usual coherent state measure @xmath132=(1/\\pi^2)\\int e^{-{b}^{\\dag}{b}}\\prod_ad{\\rm re}\\,{b}_a\\,d{\\rm im}\\,{b}_a\\ ] ] note that there is a finite number of integrations , if @xmath20 is finite , and that no time - ordering necessary : we can imagine writing everything out in terms of components , and all quantities in the path integral are commuting . on a finite graph ,",
    "only a finite number of integrations is necessary .",
    "the exponentiation of @xmath133 correctly takes into account the multiple traversing of edges by feynman paths .",
    "the next step is to average over the quenched random variables @xmath25 . as usual , since these occur in both the numerator and denominator , this is most easily done either by introducing replicas , or by adding an anticommuting ( fermionic ) copy of the bosonic variables , making it supersymmetric .",
    "we opt for the latter .",
    "thus to each pair of complex integration variables @xmath134 we introduce a pair of grassmann variables @xmath135 with corresponding labels , and we add to @xmath133 a term @xmath136 of identical form with bosonic variables replaced by fermionic ones .",

    "the average over the su(2 ) matrix @xmath142 on a given edge has the form @xmath143 where the integral is with respect to the invariant measure on su(2 ) , normalised so that @xmath144 .",
    "* lemma 1 : * _ the above integral equals @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the @xmath4 matrix with components @xmath147 .",
    "_ _ _    _ proof : _ because the fermionic variables have only two components , and any such component squares to zero , the expansion in the fermionic part terminates : @xmath148 the first term , the purely bosonic integral , is identically equal to unity .",
    "this follows from the observation that the integral is invariant under the substitutions @xmath149 , @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are independent su(2 ) matrices , and @xmath153 is a complex number , and there is no combination of @xmath154 and @xmath155 which has this property , save a constant .",
    "however , an explicit proof is given in appendix a.    the third , purely fermionic , term is also easy : @xmath156 where the fourth line follows because @xmath157 .",
    "the expression is therefore independent of @xmath142 , and the integration is then the same as in the purely bosonic term , which gives a factor 1 as before .",
    "the second term can also be worked out explicitly , but it easier to invoke the supersymmetry , and simply add @xmath158 to each element @xmath159 of the above matrix .",
    "note that the purely bosonic part of the determinant vanishes .",
    "the result of the quenched average over the su(2 ) matrix on a given edge is therefore @xmath160 the interpretation of this is clear : after averaging over the su(2 ) matrices , the only paths which contribute are those in which on each edge the allowed propagation is of either the identity , a pair of fermions @xmath161 , or a boson - fermion pair @xmath162 .",
    "note that in each case the combinations in parentheses above are su(2 ) singlets . note also that , having averaged over the edge variables @xmath25 , the distinction between @xmath163 and @xmath164 is now immaterial , and we can henceforth drop these labels .",
    "the above result has several important consequences .",
    "first , there is now only a finite number @xmath165 of possibilities for propagation along the @xmath21 edges of a finite graph @xmath20 .",
    "( this is equivalent to the result of gruzberg et al@xcite that the hilbert space of the transfer matrix is finite - dimensional . )",
    "second , it is clear why the assumption that the scattering at the nodes in diagonal in the su(2 ) indices was not crucial : only the singlet invariant amplitude matters .",
    "third , the only non - zero two - point functions with @xmath166 are @xmath167    let us for the moment take @xmath40 real .",
    "then @xmath168 , as a sum over feynman paths , is a linear combination of su(2 ) matrices with real coefficients .",
    "any such @xmath4 matrix is itself proportional to an su(2 ) matrix , up to a real scalar ( see appendix . )",
    "thus we may write @xmath169 where @xmath153 is real and @xmath170 su(2 )",
    ". hence @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , so that @xmath173 .",
    "the right hand side is a polynomial in @xmath40 .",
    "for general complex @xmath40 we have , therefore , @xmath174 when @xmath175 this is the mean point conductance , which is therefore given , up to a factor 2 , by the two - point functions in ( [ 2pt ] ) .",
    "since only su@xmath0 singlets now propagate , it follows that two - point functions like @xmath176 vanish if @xmath166 .",
    "this is because , once the matrices @xmath25 have been traced out , the supersymmetric path integral possesses a _",
    "su(2 ) gauge invariance under @xmath177 with @xmath178 su(2 ) . _ _",
    "however , this does not apply if @xmath179 .",
    "in fact , because of ( [ 2pt ] ) , it follows that @xmath180",
    "in the last section , we showed that , for a graph @xmath20 with @xmath21 edges , the quenched average of the path integral can be written as a sum of @xmath165 terms , according to which of the three terms in ( [ prop ] ) ( corresponding to the propagation of a @xmath181 pair , an @xmath182 pair , or the identity ) is chosen on each edge .",
    "let us now consider just one of these terms , and one particular node .",
    "the contribution to the path integral from this node has the form @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 and @xmath187    in doing this , we have brought together in the path integral all the factors associated with the given node .",
    "there is a subtlety , however , because the boson - fermion variables @xmath188 and @xmath189 anticommute with each other . at a given node",
    ", we may arrange these factors in the standard order determined by the fixed ( but arbitrary ) labelling of the incoming and outgoing edges . for a given term out of the @xmath165 possibilities , this will introduce an overall factor @xmath190 .    define a _",
    "decomposition _ of the node as a pairing of each outgoing edges @xmath191 with a unique incoming edge @xmath192 .",
    "this defines a permutation @xmath193 of the edge labels , whereby the outgoing edge @xmath191 paired with the incoming edge @xmath192 is @xmath194 .",
    "carried through for every node in turn , this decomposes @xmath20 into a union of disjoint directed closed loops ( and open paths if @xmath20 is open ) , such that every edge lies on just one loop or open path , and each loop or open path may pass along a given edge no more than once .",
    "the following proposition shows that we are allowed to do this inside the path integral , as long as we weight each decomposition correctly : _ _",
    "* proposition 1 . * _ the result of performing the integration over the variables @xmath195 and @xmath196 in ( [ asa ] ) is the same as if @xmath197 were replaced by @xmath198 that is , it is given by a weighted sum over all decompositions @xmath193 . in each decomposition , each state on the incoming edge @xmath192 propagates freely to @xmath194 . _ _ _    _ proof : _ since the numbers of each component of both bosons and fermions are the same in the incoming and outgoing channels , and bosons are always paired with fermions , it follows that the numbers of @xmath182 and @xmath199 pairs are individually conserved at every node .",
    "let us call the subsets of the @xmath31 outgoing channels occupied by an @xmath182 pair , a @xmath181 pair , or empty , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 , respectively , and similarly for the incoming channels , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the integrations may now be performed , expanding @xmath197 to second order in the @xmath59 and using wick s theorem .",
    "each fermion ( boson ) in outgoing channel @xmath191 , when contracted with a fermion ( boson ) in the incoming channel @xmath192 , gives ( up to a sign ) a factor @xmath206 .",
    "the bosons in @xmath201 may only contract onto the bosons in @xmath204 , but the complication is that some of the fermions in @xmath200 may contract onto fermions in @xmath204 , and some of those in @xmath201 may contract onto those in @xmath203 .",
    "however , every set of possible contractions will involve each outgoing channel in @xmath207 and each incoming channel in @xmath208 exactly twice .",
    "thus , if @xmath209 denotes a permutation of the channels in @xmath207 , then , the general form of the result will be @xmath210 where the @xmath211 are numerical coefficients .",
    "we have already introduced the notation @xmath72 for the minor of @xmath1 restricted to the ordered subsets @xmath73 and @xmath74 of outgoing and incoming channels .",
    "now define @xmath212 to be the corresponding permanent , that is , with all the terms having the same sign @xmath213 .",
    "then the claim is that the result of the integration is @xmath214 this expression has the correct properties in that : ( a ) each channel index appears exactly twice in each term ; ( b ) @xmath59 with @xmath215 and @xmath216 ( and also with @xmath217 and @xmath218 occurs at most once ; ( c ) it is symmetric under permutations of the channels in @xmath200 , and separately in @xmath203 ; ( d ) it is antisymmetric under permutations of the channels in @xmath201 , and separately in @xmath204 ; and ( e ) it has the correct overall numerical coefficient .    in order to prove ( [ ddd ] ) , it is helpful first to consider what happens if each su(2 ) singlet @xmath219 is replaced by @xmath220 ( and similarly for the conjugate variables in the incoming channels . ) in that case , the result follows immediately .",
    "the @xmath221 with @xmath215 can contract only onto the @xmath222 with @xmath218 , giving the first factor in ( [ ddd ] ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath223 with @xmath217 can contract only onto the @xmath224 with @xmath225 , giving the second factor .",
    "finally the @xmath226 are free to contract onto any of the @xmath227 , leading to the last factor .",
    "the reason that this result continues to hold when each @xmath220 is replaced by the singlet combination is the local gauge invariance already alluded to : we could imagine multiplying the whole amplitude by an independent su(2 ) matrix in each channel , and averaging over this .",
    "the final result , being gauge invariant , would not change , but it would project @xmath220 onto the singlet combination .",
    "we now need the following property of o@xmath30 matrices :    * lemma 2 . * _ if @xmath228 , and @xmath229 and @xmath230 are complementary minors of @xmath1 , then @xmath231 .",
    "_ _ _    _ proof : _ this relies on the fact that if @xmath232 has rank @xmath9 , and @xmath233 is a tensor of rank @xmath9 , then @xmath234 ( where @xmath235 is the levi - civita symbol ) transforms under proper rotations as a tensor of rank @xmath236 , and changes sign under parity .    in our case",
    "this implies that @xmath237 , so that ( [ ddd ] ) reads @xmath238 now look at ( [ sameas ] ) , inserted into the path integral instead of @xmath197 .",
    "the kronecker deltas which conserve the labels @xmath239 restrict the sum over permutations @xmath193 to those which map @xmath203 onto some permutation @xmath240 of @xmath200 , @xmath204 onto some permutation @xmath241 of @xmath201 , and so on .",
    "the signature @xmath242 decomposes into a product of the signatures of the three permutations .",
    "now , since the @xmath182 pairs propagate freely ( and they commute among themselves ) , the integrations over these variables give unity .",
    "the sum over @xmath240 is therefore @xmath243 , which gives the first factor in ( [ dddd ] ) .",
    "although the @xmath181 pairs also propagate freely , they are fermionic , which mens that their contractions give rise to an extra factor @xmath244 . on summing over all @xmath241",
    ", we get the second factor in ( [ dddd ] ) .",
    "the remaining factors of @xmath245 , with @xmath246 , when summed over @xmath247 , give the last factor .    we have shown the equivalence of the two expressions @xmath197 and ( [ sameas ] ) at each node , for each of the @xmath165 terms in the expansion of the path integral .",
    "we may now restore the anticommuting @xmath181 factors to their original ordering in the path integral , thus removing the possible overall sign .",
    "this concludes the proof of prop .  1 .",
    "first consider the case when @xmath20 is closed . in sec .",
    "iii it was shown that @xmath248 is given by the correlation function @xmath249 in the supersymmetric path integral . by the results of the previous section ,",
    "this is given by a sum of terms in which each edge except @xmath79 is occupied by either an @xmath182 pair , a @xmath181 pair , or the identity ( and @xmath79 is occupied only by an @xmath182 pair .",
    ") moreover , the path integral is given by a sum of terms , each corresponding to a decomposition of @xmath20 into closed loops .",
    "along all but one of the closed loops can freely propagate an @xmath182 pair , giving an overall factor + 1 , an @xmath181 pair , giving -1 , or the identity , giving + 1 .",
    "the first two contributions cancel , leaving a factor + 1 for each of these closed loops .",
    "the exception is the unique loop which contains the edge @xmath79 , which can be thought of as a closed trail @xmath78 , rooted at @xmath79 . along this only an @xmath182 pair",
    "is allowed to propagate .",
    "now sum over all decompositions of @xmath20 which contain the specified trail @xmath78 . at a given node @xmath29",
    ", @xmath78 occupies the incoming edges @xmath67 and the outgoing edges @xmath68 .",
    "the sum in ( [ sameas ] ) includes only those permutations @xmath193 for which @xmath250 is some permutation of @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that @xmath193 acting on the complementary subset @xmath251 is some permutation @xmath252 of the complement @xmath253 .",
    "if we now sum the factors of @xmath59 in ( [ sameas ] ) with @xmath254 and @xmath255 over the permutations @xmath252 , weighted by @xmath256 , we get @xmath257 . using lemma 2 again ,",
    "this equals @xmath258 .",
    "the latter factor of @xmath259 combines with explicit one in ( [ sameas ] ) to give unity .",
    "the remaining factors then give the weight ( [ weight ] ) of the node @xmath29 on the trail @xmath78 .",
    "this proves theorem 1 .",
    "theorem 2 follows similarly . for an open graph , @xmath260 is given by a sum of decompositions of @xmath20 as before , into closed loops as well as open paths which connect the incoming and outgoing external edges . along",
    "these propagate either @xmath182 pairs , @xmath181 pairs , or the identity , with weights at each node given by ( [ sameas ] ) . in each decomposition",
    ", there is a unique open trail @xmath61 from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , carrying an @xmath182 pair .",
    "the other open paths must carry the identity , otherwise the path integration over the free bosonic and fermionic variables at their ends would give zero .",
    "they therefore contribute a factor 1 .",
    "all the other closed loops also contribute a factor 1 after the cancellation between the @xmath182 and @xmath181 pairs which propagate around each of them .",
    "we are left with a single @xmath182 pair propagating along @xmath61 .",
    "the summation over all the decompositions of @xmath20 containing a given open trail @xmath61 then gives a factor @xmath258 at each node as above .",
    "this proves theorem 2 .",
    "we now prove theorem 3 , which states that the weights @xmath261 in theorem 1 lead , if non - negative , through ( [ cond ] ) to correctly normalised transition probabilities @xmath262 for the trail @xmath78 interpreted as a classical random walk on the edges of @xmath20 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for this is @xmath263 without loss of generality , we may relabel the rows and columns of @xmath1 so that @xmath264 for @xmath265 , and @xmath266 for @xmath267 .",
    "notice that we can remove the restriction on the sum over @xmath268 because the summand formally vanishes whenever @xmath269 .",
    "the index @xmath268 occurs on the left hand side of ( [ nsc ] ) in the factor @xmath270 as well as in each term of the expansion of the minor @xmath271 , where it occurs as @xmath272 with @xmath267 .",
    "thus the sum over @xmath268 , in each term in the expansion of the determinant , has the form @xmath273 , from the orthonormality of the rows of @xmath1 .",
    "the coefficient of this term is just the subminor @xmath274 which occurs on the right hand side of ( [ nsc ] ) .",
    "all the remaining factors @xmath275 are the same on both sides .",
    "this demonstrates the validity of ( [ nsc ] ) and thus theorem 3 .",
    "although we have argued that the weights @xmath276 appearing in theorem 1 are normalised , they may only be interpreted as probabilities if they are all non - negative .",
    "this places strong constraints on the @xmath1-matrix at each node .    taking first the case",
    "when the sets @xmath73 and @xmath74 comprise all the outgoing and incoming edges of the node , we see that the weights are all non - negative if and only if every term in the expansion of @xmath259 has the same sign , or vanishes .",
    "in fact , this is also a sufficient condition for all the weights to be non - negative when @xmath73 and @xmath74 are proper subsets .",
    "this is because , by lemma 2 , @xmath72 is , up to a factor @xmath60 , the same as its conjugate minor , and therefore each term in ( [ weight ] ) is , up to an overall sign , a sum of a subset of terms in the expansion of @xmath259 .",
    "they therefore all have the same sign , or vanish , if this is true of the individual terms in the expansion .    for @xmath15 ,",
    "this is always the case . if @xmath277 , we can write @xmath278 , so that the terms in the expansion are @xmath279 ; or if @xmath280 we can write @xmath281 , in which case they are @xmath282 . however , for an orthogonal matrix with @xmath16 , this constraint becomes nontrivial .",
    "consider first the case @xmath18 .",
    "it is elementary to show that if the @xmath283 terms in the expansion of the determinant of _ any _ @xmath284 matrix all have the sign ( or vanish ) then there must be at least one vanishing element . for",
    "consider the _ product _ of all these terms .",
    "this contains each element @xmath59 exactly twice .",
    "there are six terms in all , and three of these , corresponding to the odd permutations , occur with minus signs .",
    "hence the product of all the terms is @xmath285",
    ". this would be impossible if all the @xmath59 were non - vanishing .",
    "_ _ _ _    now any o(3 ) rotation can be composed of three suitable o(2 ) rotations about different axes , for example through the euler angles .",
    "this composition may , in general , be pictured using a diagram like that in fig .",
    "[ euler ] .",
    "each intersection of lines labelled by @xmath191 and @xmath192 corresponds to an o(2 ) rotation in the @xmath286 plane , represented by an o(2 ) matrix @xmath287 with @xmath288 .",
    "the element @xmath59 of the full o(3 ) matrix is given by a sum over directed paths from @xmath192 to @xmath191 in the diagram , each path being weighted by a product of the appropriate o(2 ) matrix elements .",
    "for example , @xmath289 each topologically distinct way of drawing and labelling fig .",
    "[ euler ] corresponds to a different but equivalent euler angle parametrisation .",
    "we can always draw the diagram so that the matrix element which vanishes by the above argument ( in this example @xmath290 ) is given by a simple form like ( [ simple ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath291 , and therefore that @xmath292 ( note that @xmath293 can always be chosen as a proper rotation . )",
    "this means that we can picture the lines 1 and 3 simply crossing at the vertex ( 2 ) , and that the full o(3 ) rotation reduces into a product of just two o(2 ) rotations , as in the definition ( [ red ] ) of reducibility .",
    "an o@xmath30 matrix has several distinct but equivalent euler angle representations as a composition of @xmath295 o@xmath0 rotations , which may be pictured using a generalisation of fig.[euler ] .",
    "an example for @xmath296 is shown in fig .",
    "[ euler4 ] .",
    "in such a diagram any given line intersects each of the others exactly once .",
    "if the matrix is completely reducible there is at least one representation which has a tree structure , that is , contains no cycles .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  [ euler4 ] .",
    "in this case , many elements of @xmath1 must vanish , and those which do not are each given by a single term which is a product of o@xmath0 matrix elements along a single possible path through the diagram .",
    "complete reducibility is a sufficient condition for the weights in ( [ weight ] ) all to be non - negative .",
    "one way to see this is to note that we can in this case decompose the node into a tree of @xmath17 nodes .",
    "the internal edges of this tree can be made to carry an arbitrary su@xmath0 matrix , which can however always be set equal to 1 by making a gauge transformation on the su@xmath0 matrices on the incoming and outgoing edges of the node ( this is not always possible if there are cycles . )",
    "we may therefore introduce such matrices on each internal edge of the tree and integrate over them without changing the problem .",
    "thus the weights for the node are products of weights for @xmath17 nodes , which we have already argued are always non - negative .",
    "next we consider whether this condition is necessary .",
    "consider the terms in the expansion of @xmath259 which contain a factor @xmath297 .",
    "the coefficient of this term is the @xmath284 minor @xmath72 with @xmath298 .",
    "the above lemma about @xmath284 matrices then shows that either this submatrix has at least one vanishing element , or the product @xmath299 vanishes . in general",
    ", every @xmath284 submatrix of @xmath1 must have at least one vanishing element , or every term in the expansion of its complementary minor must vanish .    for @xmath296",
    ", this implies that there must be at least 3 vanishing elements , not all in the same row or column . by considering the different cases , together with a suitably chosen euler angle representation ,",
    "it is possible to show that in each case a sufficient number of the o@xmath0 matrix elements must vanish that the diagram breaks up into a tree .",
    "this shows that , for @xmath296 , the condition of complete reducibility is also necessary for non - negative weights .",
    "however , we have not found a general argument for all @xmath31 and indeed there may be exceptions . what can be shown straightforwardly",
    "is that @xmath1 must have at least @xmath300 vanishing elements .    _",
