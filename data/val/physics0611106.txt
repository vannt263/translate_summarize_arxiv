    "it is a quite common view among people , that are not aware of the developments in modern physics , that it is part of human nature to substitute religious faith in places where there is no knowledge .",
    "therefore , an increase in knowledge would lead to a decrease in the necessity of faith .",
    "a classical example is the medieval belief that the sun , moon , and stars were moved in their orbits by souls ( ` anima ' ) , who had to carry on this work until the last day .",
    "this belief was made obsolete by kepler s laws of planetary motion .",
    "further , it is argued that , ideally speaking , a full knowledge of the laws of nature would make obsolete any sort of religious faith and would ultimately allow a complete control of nature by man .    since referring to nature",
    ", such views must be founded in the natural sciences of which physics is the most fundamental .",
    "therefore , the question whether such views are compatible with the current state of natural sciences is ultimately decided in physics .",
    "indeed , it is likely that the above simplistic views have their origin in the classical world view generated by the successes of newtonian physics from the middle of the @xmath0th century until the beginning of the @xmath1th century which viewed the physical world as a type of mechanical clock in which the motion of the gears affect each other in a precise and predictable way .",
    "it was assumed that with some more effort all the connections between those gears would soon be found .",
    "it is generally accepted that most physicists in the @xmath2th century believed that all the fundamental laws of nature were already known . in this world view",
    "there is no space for a christian god or religious faith .",
    "the paper points out that the above views are no longer supported by current physics and that abstracted world views can not be considered as part of natural sciences , but only as belief systems .",
    "for this , it sketches the medieval world view as the starting point of the development of physics in the @xmath0th century , describes and analyzes that development and states cornerstones of newtonian physics which have been assumed evident , but nevertheless have been destroyed by the theory of special relativity , the theory of general relativity , quantum mechanics , quantum electrodynamics and the standard model of particle physics .",
    "at the beginning of the development of modern physics in the @xmath0th century by johannes kepler , galileo galilei and issac newton , the medieval world picture derived from the ptolemaic universe prevailed in europe @xcite .",
    "it consisted of a series of @xmath3 concentric transparent spheres or ` heavens ' with the earth at their center .",
    "fixed to the first @xmath4 innermost spheres were the ` planets ' , i.e. , the moon , mercury , venus , the sun , mars , jupiter and saturn .",
    "fixed to the @xmath5th sphere were the stars .",
    "the @xmath6th sphere was called the ` first movable ' that carries no luminous body and therefore is invisible . finally , the @xmath3th sphere is ` the very heaven ' and full of the god , whose is considered immaterial and unaffected by time .",
    "hence god is unmovable , but the love for him puts the the ` first movable ' into rotation from east to west and transfers its to the other spheres . the lower spheres are rotating more slowly from west to east and are forced back by the daily impulse of the ` first movable ' .",
    "all spheres are inhabited by ` intelligences ' .",
    "the terrestrial domain of the universe inside the first innermost sphere contains bodies made out of the elements fire , air , water and earth .",
    "the heavenly bodies above the moon are made of a more perfect fifth element , the ` quintessence ' or ` aether ' .",
    "in the following , we have a brief look at some of the scientific achievements of kepler , galilei , newton and their influences on the philosophic and religious views in the last half of the @xmath0th century .",
    "_ kepler _ @xmath7 was a devout christian .",

    "in particular , a sphere was a reflection of christian trinity with god the father as its center , christ the son as periphery and the intervening space as holy spirit .",
    "he tried to explain the distances among the six copernican planets by circumscribing and inscribing each orbit with one of the five regular polyhedrons . in a letter from @xmath8",

    "mechanics is the basis of his physiology and medicine . _",

    "it is known that newton studied the works of descartes and other _ mechanical philosophers _ , who _ viewed physical reality as composed entirely of particles of matter in motion and _ who _ held that all the phenomena of nature result from their mechanical interaction_.    in @xmath15 , _ newton _",
    "@xmath16 published his famous three laws of motion which provide the basis of mechanics to this day @xcite . together with his and independently gottfried wilhelm leibniz s @xmath17 discovery of differential and integral calculus , these laws transformed the field of mechanics into an exact science . in @xmath18 ,",
    "newton formulated his law of gravitation that have kepler s laws of planetary motion and the results of galilei s experiments on motion on inclined planes as particular consequences .",
    "hence the laws of mechanics also unified the knowledge on mechanical systems at that time .",
    "after the groundbreaking work of newton , the motion of the planets and comets of the solar system was predictable to high accuracy and understood on the basis of natural laws .",
    "the announcement by le verrier in @xmath19 , that there was an unexplained advance in the perihelion of mercury , was not regarded as a failure of newtonian mechanics , but due to unknown gravitational sources .",
    "an explanation for this advance was given by einstein s theory of general relativity in @xmath20 @xcite . a first indication for the breakdown of classical physics appeared at the end of @xmath2th century in form of the failure of the rayleigh - jeans law to describe the observed behaviour of black body radiation . in @xmath21 ,",
    "max planck derived his radiation law that gave a correct description , but a the cost of assuming that the oscillators comprising the blackbody could absorb energy only in discrete amounts , in quanta of energy .",
    "this led to the development of quantum mechanics .        _ because of its highly accurate descriptions , mechanics became regarded as the ultimate explanatory science .",
    "phenomena of any kind , it was believed , could and should be explained in terms of mechanical concepts .",

    "the marvelous development of mechanics in the @xmath25th century , thermal engineering and thermodynamics in the beginning of the @xmath2th century give evidence of the power of that approach .      in the following , from a modern perspective",
    ", we analyze the important changes in the approach to nature that have occurred in @xmath0th century .",
    "first , the method of natural sciences had been established .",
    "this method tries to separate nature into systems that are to a good approximation ` isolated ' , in the sense that the inclusion of their interaction with the remaining part of nature would introduce only small changes below the intended accuracy of description .",
    "note that such separation is non - trivial and involves an _ assumption _ that itself can not be verified .",
    "such supposedly isolated systems are studied by precise experiments or observations .",
    "the corresponding measurements are subjected to a mathematical analysis with the goal of abstraction of a natural law or ` theory ' .",
    "predictions of the theory are tested by additional experiments or observations .",
    "if the results are consistent with those predictions within the accuracy of the measurements , the theory is maintained . otherwise , the theory is revised . in the last case ,",
    "the process is continued until consistency with known experiments and observations is reached .    note that even if the initial assumption of isolation of the system is false , this process can still lead to an accurate description by the theory if , for some reason , it successfully ` captures ' the influence of the surrounding . the simplest way to achieve",
    "this is to include a larger number of constants into the theory that can be adapted to measurements . to avoid the last",
    ", it is generally demanded that a theory should be in some sense ` simple ' or ` aesthetic ' .",
    "experiments and observations provide the basis of the method of natural sciences in that their outcome decides on the ` truth ' of a theory .",
    "if predicted qualitatively and quantitatively correctly by a theory , a natural phenomenon is considered to be ` understood ' or ` explained ' _ in terms of the theory_.    note that in the case of a false assumption of isolation of the system , a ` true ' theory is still ` false ' in the sense that it can not be expected that it describes correctly the ` nature ' of the system .",
    "note also that _ there are no proofs in natural sciences _ , although galilei uses this notion in the above cited passage from @xmath13 . differently to mathematics , those are based on experiment , not on logic . ultimately , in natural sciences even logic is subject to experimental verification .",
    "the focus on mechanical phenomena allowed the development of a highly successful theory , i.e. , newtonian mechanics , that was believed to be consistent with experiments and observations of increasing accuracy until the beginning of the @xmath1th century .",
    "that there was an unexplained advance in the perihelion of mercury was not regarded as a failure of newtonian mechanics , but due to unknown gravitational sources . ] under the impression of the successes of this theory , there was abstracted a philosophical world view , the clockwork universe where god is regarded as a creator of natural laws governing its evolution and the agent that set the clock initially into motion .",
    "after that , the evolution of the world is thought to be completely deterministic .",
    "it is believed that a miracle , in the sense of a divine intervention into nature which does contradict natural laws , does not occur .",
    "that abstraction of a philosophical world view , although tempting , provides a classic example of the quite common _ mistake _ of the layman _ to identify a theory with the part of nature it only describes_. the method of natural sciences _ defines _ the ` truth ' of a theory as its consistency with known experiments and observations within the accuracy of measurements .",
    "there is no generally accepted method available to decide whether the theory is true in some absolute sense . on the contrary",
    ", the history of physics showed that ultimately every theory turned out to be ` false ' , in the sense that its predictions were inconsistent with more precise experiments or observations which made its revision necessary .",
    "such revisions led to new theories which explained the phenomena of the older theories qualitatively and quantitatively and at the same a large number of additional natural phenomena those older theories could not account for . _ but , as will be pointed out later on , in every step in this sequence , concepts that were fundamental in the formulation of the older theory were negated by its successor . from this point of view , it can very well be said that fundamental aspects of the older theories were false .",
    "_ there is no reason to believe that this will be different for future theories . here",
    ", it should also be taken into account that by the rules of logic , a false statement can imply a true statement .",
    "for instance , a compound statement falsely claiming a true statement and a false statement at the same time leads to a true statement by omitting that false part of the statement .",
    "the statement    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` tigers are mammals and mice are reptiles ' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    is false , but it implies the true statement    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` tigers are mammals'_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    hence , a false theory can very well lead to results consistent with experiments or observations . for these reasons ,",
    "the abstraction of philosophical a world view from such theories is inherently flawed .",
    "_ therefore , the abstraction of philosophical world views from natural sciences leads to a belief system , only .",
    "in particular , differently from these sciences , such views can not claim exactness .",

    "physics increasingly emerges as the root of the natural sciences .",
    "therefore , there is reason to view darwin s and other theories of evolution from a physicist s point of view .",
    "presently , because of their ad hoc nature and lack of quantitative statements , from this point of view , those theories seem to be more working hypotheses than theories .",
    "also for this reason , they seem to be unsuitable for the abstraction of a world view .",
    "in the following , we state the established physical theories subsequent to newtonian mechanics in chronological order and give a short description of fundamental changes they introduced .",
    "that descent of the mechanical theory of nature started with the analysis of electrical and magnetic phenomena in the @xmath2th century , in particular with the discovery of radio waves propagating at the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "meters per second ] such waves were predicted by the electromagnetic theory of james clerk maxwell @xmath26 from @xmath27 @xcite . they were produced and measured in the laboratory by heinrich hertz @xmath28 in @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth noting that in attempting to illustrate faraday s law of induction , maxwell constructed a mechanical model @xcite .",
    "also , it was assumed that those waves had some sort of a material carrier , the so called ` ether ' , similar to sound waves that are compression waves in matter . in @xmath30 and @xmath29 ,",
    "this theory was shattered by the michelson - morley experiments , which were designed specifically to detect the motion of the earth through the ether and which indicated that there was no such effect .",
    "_ as a consequence , the existence of non - mechanical entities in addition to matter was realized , i.e. , force fields that are propagating through empty space . _",
    "maxwell s electromagnetic equations require waves to move at the speed of light in vacuum in every inertial system , that is in every reference frame where free matter moves with constant speeds and on a straight lines .",
    "two such reference frames move relative to each other at a constant speed .",
    "therefore , the propagation of electromagnetic waves contradicts common experience that suggests that the wave speed should appear to be different as measured from different inertial systems .        in @xmath31",
    ", albert einstein @xmath32 made the constancy of the speed of light and the requirement that the laws of physics should assume the same form in every inertial system _ postulates _ of his special theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "this led to radical changes of newtonian mechanics .",
    "the concept of absolute time or rather of absolute simultaneity of events lost its meaning and became dependent on the reference frame instead .",
    "as a consequence , also the concept of rigid bodies had to be abandoned .",
    "_ all these notions are central in newtonian mechanics_.      newton s law of gravitation is incompatible with the theory of special relativity and therefore needed a revision after the arrival of this theory .",
    "this was achieved in @xmath33 by albert einstein s theory of general relativity @xcite that absorbs the gravitational field into the geometry of space - time . in this",
    ", the theory generalizes the special theory of relativity and again radically alters newtonian mechanics on a fundamental level .",
    "in particular , it removes the gravitational field from any energy momentum balance of a physical system under the influence of such a ` field ' . as a consequence ,",
    "in general there is no conserved total energy or momentum associated to such a system .",
    "the theory of quantum mechanics or more general quantum theory was developed by werner heisenberg @xmath34 , max born @xmath35 and pascual jordan @xmath36 in @xmath37 because of the clear failure of newtonian mechanics to describe the physical phenomena in the range of atomic distances , i.e , @xmath38 meter @xmath39 nanometer and below @xcite .",
    "this theory shook the foundations of physics like no other before or after because of its probabilistic character . that character allows statements on individual systems only in the exceptional cases of the occurrence of probabilities of value @xmath40 .",
    "_ it denies the possibility of a deterministic description simultaneously of the positions and the momenta of the members of a mechanical system .",
    "it gives a deterministic description only for the probability distribution of those quantities .",
    "_    in this , it departs radically from the previous theories which were from then on referred to as ` classical ' .",
    "the statistical nature of the theory was a major shock for physicists and is the reason why a few physicists still consider it to be an incomplete theory .",
    "notably , albert einstein was among them .",
    "the desperation of physicists , caused by the inapplicability of the ideas from classical physics to atomic systems , is very well depicted in a letter from @xmath37 of wolfgang pauli @xmath41 , later a nobel prize winner in physics , to his assistant ralph kronig @xmath42 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` currently , physics is again very muddled . for me at least ,",

    "also the opposite process is possible . as a consequence , matter and light",
    "can be considered as two manifestations of one field .",
    "some of the most precise tests of quantum electrodynamics have been experiments dealing with the properties of subatomic particles known as muons .",
    "the magnetic moment of this type of particle has been shown to agree with the theory to nine significant digits .",
    "agreement of such high accuracy makes quantum electrodynamics one of the most successful physical theories so far devised .",
    "the standard model of particle physics is a generalization of quantum electrodynamics which also includes weak and strong nuclear forces that are in particular responsible for radioactive decay and the stability of atomic nuclei .",
    "it does not take into account the gravitational field . until recently , it has proved highly successful in the description of experimental observations .",
    "however , experiments in @xmath43 , ( k2k - i ) @xmath44 ( k2k - ii ) and @xmath45 ( minos ) indicate that neutrinos have mass which is not taken into account in the standard model .    also , one of the basic assumptions of particle physics in general is the ancient idea ( democritus , ca . @xmath46",
