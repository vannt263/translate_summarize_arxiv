    "rolling adhesion of white blood cells ( leukocytes ) along the vascular endothelium plays a key role in the immune response and is a prominent example for the interplay between transport and specific adhesion in biological systems @xcite .",
    "random encounters between cell and vessel wall lead to the formation of initial bonds based on adhesion receptors from the selectin - family . because selectins are characterized by fast association and dissociation kinetics , new bonds are readily formed on the downstream side and old bonds are continuously ruptured at the upstream side .",
    "if the processes of bond formation and rupture are sufficiently balanced , rolling adhesion results . as rolling velocity is smaller than the velocity of a cell moving freely in hydrodynamic flow , this mechanism allows the leukocytes to more efficiently survey the vessel wall for appropriate molecular signals .",
    "the main signals in this context are chemokine molecules , which indicate the presence of an infection and lead to firm adhesion based on the adhesion receptors from the integrin - family .",
    "firm adhesion in turn is a prerequisite for transendothelial migration into the surrounding tissue .",
    "similar mechanisms are used by stem and cancer cells to disseminate in the body through the blood flow .",
    "the main tool for investigating rolling adhesion under controlled conditions are flow chambers @xcite .",
    "there receptor - carrying cells suspended in an aqueous solution are perfused in linear shear flow above a ligand - coated wall .",
    "for example , it was shown with flow chamber experiments that selectin bonds have fast kinetic rates and that the dissociation rate increases with force ( slip bond ) , thus explaining their superior function in mediating rolling adhesion @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated by a combination of atomic force microscopy and flow chamber experiments that the lifetime of single selectin bonds shows a biphasic response under force @xcite .",
    "such a catch - slip bond behavior might have evolved to avoid adhesion of leukocytes under static conditions . indeed it has been found early in flow chamber experiments that leukocytes adhere only above a critical threshold of shear @xcite .",
    "in addition to specific properties of the molecular bonds , transport processes might also play an important role in creating the shear threshold @xcite .",
    "both rolling adhesion @xcite and the shear threshold @xcite have also been demonstrated in cell - free flow chamber experiments with ligand - coated micron - sized beads .",
    "although cell - free rolling is more erratic than leukocyte rolling , this indicates that cellular features ( like cell deformability ) are not essential to rolling adhesion .",
    "flow chamber experiments also allow to study the exact effect of non - molecular parameters , for example of changes in the viscosity of the medium . by adding an inert substance like the sugar ficoll",
    ", it is possible to change shear stress but not shear rate in a flow chamber experiment , thus dissecting the respective roles of force and transport @xcite .",
    "the standard observable in flow chamber experiments is the translational velocity as a function of time @xcite . from this time series",
    "further variables can be derived , for example average and standard deviation of velocity . in the case of low ligand density ,",
    "a stopped cell is most likely held by a single bond and detaches without rebinding .",
    "then the time series can be used to measure single bond lifetime . at higher ligand density",
    ", rolling occurs .",
    "because rolling is never smooth but erratic due to the stochastic processes on the molecular level , then the time series can be used to measure pause time distributions .",
    "the velocity time series can also be used to define different states of motion of the cell .",
    "typically a cell is said to undergo rolling whenever its mean velocity ( averaged over some seconds ) significantly decreases compared to the free ( hydrodynamic ) velocity .",
    "if no motion can be detected for several seconds , the cell is considered to be in firm adhesion @xcite .    because rolling adhesion is not only of large physiological importance , but also characterized by an intricate interplay of different physical factors , it has long been subject to intense modeling efforts .",
    "if molecular effects are of interest , then such modeling efforts typically start with physical models for bond association and dissociation @xcite .",
    "combined with the hydrodynamics of a sphere in front of a wall , they lead to algorithms known as adhesive dynamics @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied before to different aspects of rolling adhesion , e.g. , the interplay of two receptor systems @xcite or the effect of catch bonds @xcite .",
    "recently we have developed a new variant of this algorithm which in contrast to earlier approaches fully resolves the spatial positions of the receptors on the sphere and the ligands on the wall . using this approach",
    ", we were able to predict the efficiency of initiating cell adhesion in shear flow as a function of the density and geometry of the receptor and ligand patches @xcite .",
    "a large modeling effort has also been spent on the role of cell deformability @xcite and the interaction between multiple particles @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the case of moderate shear flow and small numbers of cells , when cell deformability and hydrodynamic interactions between cells are not relevant @xcite .    a convenient way to present the results from adhesive dynamics simulations of rolling adhesion is the calculation of state diagrams which predict different types of motion over a large range of model parameters @xcite . because in flow chamber experiments one usually measures only translational velocity as a function of time , these state diagrams have been determined before based only on the translational velocity simulated as a function of different molecular parameters .",
    "however , computer simulations also allow to track the angular velocity of a cell , thus doubling the number of degrees of freedom that could be compared . for example , in physical terms cell rolling means that translation and rotation are synchronized .",
    "although this fact was already noted in the pioneering paper on adhesive dynamics @xcite , it has not been systematically exploited due to the lack of experimental data . here",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the different dynamic states of rolling adhesion which is based on the simultaneous tracking of both translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast to earlier work in this field , we fully resolve the spatial positions of receptors and ligands and calculate the state diagrams as a function of the on- and off - rate .",
    "moreover , we explore the role of different external parameters , including the viscosity of the medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we explain our numerical method , which is a combination of a langevin equation accounting for hydrodynamic and thermal forces in the limit of small reynolds numbers ( stokesian dynamics ) @xcite and adhesive dynamics accounting for the forces caused by the formation of adhesive bonds between cell and substrate @xcite . by taking care of the diffusive motion of the sphere ,",
    "we are able to explicitly resolve both receptor and ligand positions . as a first application of the hydrodynamic part of our model",
    ", we explain the physical difference between slipping and rolling .",
    "we close this section with a detailed description of the parameters relevant for the algorithm . in",
    "we point out , using a simple analytical description , how the cell slows down and simultaneously synchronizes its translational and angular velocity under the action of bonds .",
    "then we discuss the mean velocities of the cell as a function of the on- and off - rate of the receptor - ligand bonds .",
    "based on this we define five distinct states of stationary motion for a cell in a flow chamber .",
    "in we identify these different states in state diagrams displaying the dependence on the internal bond parameters , i.e. , the on- and off - rate .",
    "in addition , the effect of external parameters to the location of the states in the space of different on- and off - rates is discussed . in the closing section ,",
    ", we argue that molecular parameters can be much better extracted from flow chamber experiments if both translational and rotational degrees of freedom are measured , as it is done in our simulations .",
    "furthermore we propose experiments based on recent nanotechnological developments that could result in flow chamber data for the angular velocities of cells or microspheres .",
    "as a simple model system for a cell or a microsphere in a flow chamber we use a rigid sphere of radius @xmath0 that moves above a wall ( cf . ) . for objects as small as white blood cells ( with diameters @xmath1 m )",
    "the typical value for the reynolds number is much less than one and inertia can be neglected ( overdamped motion ) . therefore , the flow around the cell is laminar and well described by the linear stokes equation .",
    "cells are usually observed only close to the wall , that is at a distance to the wall which is much smaller than the separation between the two parallel glass plates used in a flow chamber . in this region",
    "the unperturbed flow profile is approximately linear . throughout this paper",
    "we therefore consider the sphere to flow in simple shear flow , i.e. , we consider the shear rate @xmath2 to be a constant",
    ".    in the situation under consideration the sphere is not only driven by the imposed shear flow but also by direct forces exerted on the cell .",
    "these include a constant gravitational drift force which results from a slight density difference between the cells and the surrounding medium . for flow chamber experiments",
    ", this implies that most cells adhere to the bottom plate , which usually is also the plate coated with ligands . in our context , the strongest forces result after initial binding from receptor - ligand bonds that pull on the sphere . a third source of force",
    "are thermal forces which are ubiquitous for objects in the micrometer range and lead to diffusive motion .",
    "this kind of motion can be described by an appropriate langevin equation .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a six - dimensional state vector @xmath3 which includes both the three translational and the three rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the first three components of @xmath3 denote the cartesian coordinates with respect to a flow chamber based coordinate system ( cf . ) .",
    "the last three components describe the rotation that maps a coordinate system fixed to the center and the orientation of the sphere to the flow chamber fixed coordinate system .",
    "similar compact notations are introduced for velocities and forces .",
    "the symbol @xmath4 denotes a six - dimensional velocity with the first three components being translational velocities and the last three being angular velocities .",
    "@xmath5 is the combined force and torque vector . using this notation , the langevin equation describing the motion of the cell reads @xcite @xmath6 here ,",
    "@xmath7 is the @xmath8 mobility matrix .",
    "@xmath9 is the velocity of the unperturbed shear flow at the position of the center of the sphere .",
    "@xmath10 is the shear force , which results from the hydrodynamic interaction between the cell and the wall .",
    "@xmath11 denotes all direct forces ( torques ) acting on the sphere , like gravity and bond forces .",
    "the terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the effect of thermal noise .",
    "@xmath13 is gaussian white noise with @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the ambient temperature and @xmath16 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the mobility matrix for a sphere above a wall depends the distance between sphere and wall @xcite .",
    "thus , the noise is multiplicative , leading to the gradient term @xmath17 in .",
    "we interpret the noise @xmath18 in the usual stratonovich sense .",
    "however , is written in its it version @xcite , as indicated by the superscript @xmath19 .",
    "this allows to directly derive a simple euler algorithm for the update step @xmath20 of the configuration of the sphere during a time step @xmath21 . in non - dimensional",
    "form , using the radius @xmath0 of the sphere as the length scale , the inverse shear rate @xmath22 as the time scale , and @xmath23 as the force scale , the first order discretized version of reads @xmath24 here the dimensionless pclet number @xmath25 describes the relative importance of convective versus diffusive motion of the sphere .",
    "the first two moments for the gaussian white noise now read @xmath26 the algorithm is also known as stokesian dynamics and has been derived , e.g. , by brady and bossis @xcite and for vanishing shear flow by ermak and mccammon @xcite . a more detailed description of our algorithm is given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to obtain accurate results when simulating the motion of the sphere it is essential to properly calculate the mobility matrix @xmath7 and the shear force @xmath27 . in our simulations we use a numerical method described by jones et al .",
    "@xcite which allows to accurately calculate the components of the mobility matrix for a single sphere above a wall for arbitrary sphere wall distances .",
    "the values obtained by this method agree very well with the classical results given for some tabulated height values by goldman et al .",
    ".    from one readily sees that diffusive motion is less relevant if the pclet number @xmath28 is large . using typical values for white blood cells ( cf . )",
    "one finds that @xmath28 is of the order @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , regarding the motion in flow direction thermal motion can be neglected on the scale of the cell radius . however , for the motion in @xmath30-direction the only force on a freely flowing cell is gravitation , which is small due the small density difference between the cell and the surrounding medium and therefore comparable to thermal forces in this direction @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in our work we use the full langevin equation from .",
    "another reason why we keep the diffusion terms in despite the large @xmath28 values has to do with the size of the receptors on the surface of the cell and will become more apparent in the next subsection , .    for the following it is important to consider how the translational velocity @xmath31 ( in @xmath32-direction ) and the angular velocity @xmath33 ( for rotations about the @xmath34-axis ) behave in the limits of small and large separation from the wall .",
    "if the translational and angular velocities were completely synchronized , the ratio @xmath35 should be equal to unity .",
    "this would correspond to rolling in a macroscopic sense , e.g.for a sticky sphere rolling down an inclined plane or for a car wheel on the street .",
    "we now show that the situation is different for a cell in free hydrodynamic motion . for @xmath30 denoting the height of the center of the sphere above the wall",
    ", @xmath36 denotes the gap between sphere and wall . in we plot @xmath31 and @xmath33 as a function of @xmath36 in the limit of deterministic motion , @xmath37 .    .",
    "translational and angular velocity @xmath31 and @xmath33 , respectively , and their ratio @xmath35 are shown as a function of the separation @xmath38 between sphere and wall .",
    "the thin lines depict the asymptotic behavior for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . @xmath31 and @xmath33 are plotted in units of @xmath41 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is measured in units of @xmath0 . ]    for the sphere far away from the wall , @xmath42 , we have the case of free flow , thus @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath35 vanishes in this limit . for the sphere approaching the wall , @xmath45 , both @xmath31 and @xmath33 slowly approach zero due to the hydrodynamic no - slip boundary condition .",
    "the ratio @xmath35 however approaches a finite limit @xmath46 as computed by goldman et al .",
    "together these results show that hydrodynamic interactions increasingly synchronize translational and angular velocities as the cell approaches the wall . however , the ratio @xmath35 never reaches the value @xmath47 as it would for rolling in a macroscopic sense .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamic coupling between the cell and the wall is not strong enough to lead to rolling and a freely moving cell is always slipping .",
    "we now include receptors , ligands and receptor - ligand bonds into our model . throughout this paper",
    "we call the cellular part of a bond _ receptor _ and its counter part on the wall _ ligand_. before a cell receptor can react with a wall ligand to form a complex ( bond ) , there must be a physical transport process which brings the two components to close proximity .",
    "formally bond formation can be separated into a transport and a reaction step using the notion of an encounter complex @xcite .",
    "the encounter complex is formed whenever a receptor and a ligand are less than the capture radius @xmath48 away from each other .",
    "therefore , we model receptors as _ reactive patches _ on the sphere surface having a spherical capture range of radius @xmath48 .",
    "the capture length @xmath48 bridges the gap between the continuum approach followed by implementing linear hydrodynamics and the discrete nature of the receptor molecules .",
    "ligands are modeled as dots on the boundary wall . because we explicitly resolve receptor and ligand positions , it is essential to also include diffusive motion in the algorithm , .",
    "although diffusion plays a minor role for the relative position of the cell , it affects the positions of its surface receptors , which are of much smaller size than the sphere itself .    during the time an encounter",
    "complex exists it can react to the final receptor - ligand bond complex with the on - rate @xmath49 .",
    "reversely , any bond complex can rupture into the encounter state with the off - rate @xmath50 .",
    "experimentally it has been found that the dissociation rate depends on the physical force acting on the bond complex @xcite .",
    "these early experiments agreed nicely with the simplest model for bond dissociation under force , which had been conceived first by bell @xcite : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the dissociation rate at zero pulling force , @xmath53 the force on the bond and @xmath54 the detachment force scale . the bell model , , can be rationalized using kramers theory as being a thermally activated escape over a transition state barrier in the presence of an external force @xcite .",
    "although recent evidence suggests that the dissociation rate shows a more complicated force dependence at small forces @xcite , has been demonstrated to properly describe the dissociation process for selectin bonds in the high force regime @xcite .",
    "here we use the bell model for conceptual and computational simplicity .    in order to include the probabilistic nature of bond formation and rupture",
    ", the algorithm has to be extended to include rules that take care of these processes .",
    "such rules have been first set - up by hammer and co - workers @xcite and been refined many times to model various aspects of leukocyte rolling .",
    "they are now known as _",
    "adhesive dynamics_. here , we briefly explain the main idea behind these rules . a detailed description of our implementation of these rules is then given in the appendix , . in order to simulate the motion of a cell under the action of bonds ,",
    "the configuration of the sphere is updated at each time step @xmath21 according to .",
    "if , after some update , a receptor patch on the surface of the sphere overlaps with a wall ligand a receptor - ligand bond forms with rate @xmath49 , i.e. , the probability for bond formation during time step @xmath21 is @xmath55 .",
    "existing bonds are modeled as harmonic springs , i.e. , the force along these bonds is proportional to the bond extension , essentially given by @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 being the receptor and ligand position , respectively ( see ) .",
    "force and torque resulting from extended bonds enter then the configuration update equation , , via the direct force term @xmath11 . similarly to bond formation , the probability for bond rupture during time step @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath50 is the force dependent dissociation rate according to .",
    "in contrast to earlier implementations of adhesive dynamics , we explicitly resolve both receptors and ligands in space , rather than considering a wall homogeneously coated with ligands at constant density .",
    "one immediate advantage of our method is that it avoids a flow rate - dependent rate of bond formation @xcite . in order to be able to spatially",
    "resolve both ligands and receptors , it is necessary to include the brownian motion of the cell .",
    "if one considered only the deterministic part of , at low densities of receptors and ligands it could happen that a receptor never finds a ligand . although these extensions of adhesive dynamics lead to increased computational effort , they are closer to real biological systems , which on the molecular level are in permanent thermal motion . in particular , in the future our implementation will allow us to model receptor - ligand kinetics in more molecular detail .",
    "as will be discussed later , our algorithm also opens up the perspective to compare adhesive dynamics simulations to flow chamber experiments using substrates with nanopatterned ligand .",
    "our model contains thirteen different dimensional parameters . with @xmath0 , @xmath22 , @xmath61 being the natural scales of length , time and force , respectively , we are left with ten numerical ( dimensionless ) parameters appearing in the algorithm .",
    "typical values for these ( both the dimensional and dimensionless ) parameters are listed in .",
    "the parameters @xmath62 influence the flow properties and besides viscosity we keep these parameters fixed . for the ambient temperature @xmath15",
    "we choose room temperature @xmath63  k. for flow chamber experiments with cells , the choice @xmath64  k would be more appropriate , but the exact choice of this value , which affects bond dissociation kinetics and effective strength of diffusion , turns out to be irrelevant for the physiologically relevant parameter values chosen here .",
    "for the stokes radius @xmath0 of the cells we use @xmath65 m which is about the measured radius of neutrophils , a main type of leukocytes undergoing rolling adhesion @xcite .",
    ".parameters used for the adhesive dynamics simulations . if no extra symbol for the dimensionless quantity is defined we use the same symbol for both the dimensional and dimensionless representation of this quantity . [ tab : leuk : parameters ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      before discussing the impact of the number of receptor patches on the cell surface , we first estimate the number of receptor patches within the contact zone given @xmath66 .",
    "supposing the cell touches the wall it immediately follows from basic geometrical considerations that on average @xmath67 receptor patches are in principle in capture range to wall ligands .",
    "on the other hand , the average number of ligands in range to receptors is calculated form the product of the projected area of the contact zone to the wall and the ligand density .",
    "the radius of the projected contact area is @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
    "thus the number of ligands in the contact zone is @xmath70 .    in",
    "a we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. , in the contact zone @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( for @xmath75 ) .",
    "therefore , the number of receptors limits the maximum number of bonds in all three cases .",
    "in addition , using as an estimate for the receptor patch density on the sphere @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 , i.e. , even for @xmath78 receptor patches , they do not cover the contact zone completely .",
    "so , not every receptor necessarily encounters a ligand , and therefore the number of tether bonds is even less than @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , in the rolling state , we actually measure an average number of @xmath80 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for @xmath85 existing bonds , respectively , depending on the actual on- and off - rate , which is less than the respective @xmath79 .",
    "a shows that the larger @xmath66 , the smaller on - rates @xmath86 are sufficient to support rolling .",
    "not every receptor - ligand encounter ( i.e. , overlap of the receptor patch with a ligand ) turns into a bond .",
    "this happens only with a probability depending on @xmath86 and the dwelling time of the encounter .",
    "thus , the more encounter occur per time the more bonds will be formed at a given rate @xmath86 . as the encounter rate increases with increasing number of receptor patches @xcite , this also increases the average number of bonds .    a shows that the transient ii region expands with decreasing @xmath66 .",
    "the main effect here is that for smaller @xmath66 the rolling turns into transient motion , while the border line between free and transient motion is much less effected by the decrease in the number of receptor patches .",
    "the large @xmath87-range for the transient states is a signature of few bonds being at work as we will see again when discussing the influence of ligand - ligand distance .",
    "then , single tethers slow the cell down ( depending on the off - rate they may either arrest the cell some while , resulting in state ` transient ii ' , or just decelerate them resulting in state ` transient i ' ) , but after dissociation it is unlikely that the current state of motion is supported by further bonds .",
    "however , as long as at least two bonds are possible this effect is partly compensated at large on - rates when the probability for receptor - ligand encounter to result in a bond is high .      to demonstrate the impact of ligand - ligand distance ,",
    "b shows the state diagrams for @xmath88 and @xmath78 . using the expressions derived in the previous subsection we now have @xmath89 , respectively , for the number of ligands in the contact zone .",
    "the mean number of receptors that may form a bonds is @xmath90 .",
    "so , in principle @xmath79 limits the number of bonds in the two cases of higher ligand density and @xmath91 is the limiting value only for the very low ligand density .",
    "when we measure the average number of bonds at high on - rates and relatively small off - rates ( i.e. in the rolling and firm adhesion region ) we find for the intermediate ligand density with @xmath92 about five bonds , and for the large ligand density with @xmath93 about fourteen bonds on average . the later value is slightly larger than @xmath94 .",
    "this can be explained with the elasticity of the bonds that  once formed ",
    "allows them to also exist beyond the contact zone .",
    "thus only at very high ligand densities with @xmath95 , the number of receptors limits the maximum number of bonds . for ligand densities with @xmath96",
    "a decrease in @xmath97 still leads to an increase in the average number of bonds as this increases the rate of receptor - ligand encounters .",
    "the basic effect of decreasing the ligand density as illustrated by b is the shift of all state from the upper left towards the lower right in the on - off state diagram .",
    "for example rolling is only supported at larger on - rates and smaller off - rates when the ligand density is decreased ( i.e. , @xmath97 is increased ) . also the border line between the state of free and transient motion",
    "is notedly shifted between the two extreme cases of ligand density simulated for b. in fact , the shift of this border line is much more pronounced than in the previous discussed case where the number of receptor patches was reduced .",
    "the simple reason for that is that in a @xmath79 is changed by a factor of five whereas in b the @xmath98 is changed by a factor of almost twenty .",
    "similarly to the case of reduced number of receptor patches , a small ligand density results in an increased @xmath87 range for transient adhesion .",
    "thus , we note again that at a reduced rate of receptor - ligand encounters , rolling tends to be converted to transient motion",
    ". we also note that if several parameters are changed at the same time , the overall effect can be qualitatively understood by superimposing the effects of the single parameter changes described above ( data not shown ) .",
    "the on - off state diagrams introduced here display the state of motion of a cell or a receptor covered micro - bead for a given set of experimental parameters in a wide range of possible on- and off - rates of the receptor - ligand pair . because the molecular properties of a given receptor - ligand pair can be assumed to be given _ a priori _ , each pair corresponds to one point in the on - off state diagram . in the following",
    "we show how the considerations regarding the rolling state presented here can be used to determine the dynamic on - rate @xmath86 of a receptor - ligand pair by changing the external parameter . for this line of reasoning the off - rate @xmath99",
    "is assumed to be known , e.g.  from dynamic force spectroscopy experiments . shows the ratio of the mean velocities @xmath100 of the cell as a function of @xmath86 for different ligand - to - ligand distances @xmath97 .",
    "we see that for a given @xmath97 the cell is slipping if the on - rate is small . increasing the on - rate turns the cell s motion into rolling , i.e. , at some critical on - rate @xmath101 the ratio @xmath100 reaches the value @xmath102 which we defined for rolling .",
    "the smaller ( larger ) the ligand density ( ligand - to - ligand distance @xmath97 ) the larger is the critical on - rate @xmath101 .",
    "more quantitatively this is shown in the inset of where @xmath101 is plotted as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "if one now changes the ligand density in a series of flow chamber experiments from low to high values and by doing so determines the @xmath97-value at which the motion of the cell turns from transient to rolling motion , then one can read of from the inset of the on - rate @xmath86 of the receptor - ligand bond .",
    "the described procedure does not work for very small on - rates for which rolling is not possible even for very large ligand densities ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) . on the other hand one",
    "can always find a ligand distance at which rolling is not possible whatever value the on - rate takes .",
    "at very low ligand densities @xmath104 the reaction is limited by the encounter rate and even for very large rates",
    "@xmath86 rolling is not possible .",
    "in this paper we introduced a new version of the adhesive dynamics algorithm .",
    "in contrast to earlier work , our approach also includes the diffusive motion of cells resulting from thermal fluctuations .",
    "this allowed us to spatially resolve receptors and ligands .",
    "an immediate advantage of this approach is that the single bond on - rate @xmath49 can be chosen to be independent of the relative motion of cell and substrate . in this work , we focused on the different dynamic states of motion which can be identified on the cellular level .",
    "we first noticed that the action of a single bond not only slows the cell down , but also changes the motion from slipping ( which is the case for cells moving free in hydrodynamic flow ) to rolling in the sense @xmath105 . in the case of multiple bonds , rolling can also be observed regarding the mean values of the velocities , i.e. , @xmath106 at proper rates of bond formation and rupturing .",
    "this motivated us to define the state of rolling adhesion as @xmath107 . by extending these observations we defined five distinct states of stationary cell motion .",
    "these states were then displayed in so - called on - off state diagrams which showed the impact of different molecular rates .",
    "in addition , we investigated the effect of external parameters .",
    "for example , we showed that the cellular motion is changed considerably when the viscosity of the medium is changed .",
    "our work shows that different dynamic states of cell motion can be defined in a systematic and quantitative way .",
    "in particular , calculations of state diagrams allow us to obtain a complete understanding of the way molecular and other parameters determine motion on the scale of a cell .",
    "similar approaches have been taken before @xcite , but without a proper definition of rolling in the mechanical sense .",
    "our computer work now shows that including the rotational degrees of freedom allows us to investigate the transition from hydrodynamic slipping to bond - mediated rolling in a more detailed way .",
    "experimentally it is certainly a challenge to obtain similar data in flow chamber experiments for micron - sized beads or cells . in principle , making use of recent nanotechnological developments one could attach receptors to micron - sized beads which are covered with anisotropic surface layers @xcite . if these layers are anisotropically reflective , rotational motion of the spheres can be recorded . for cells , one would have to track surface or intracellular markers ( e.g.  mitochondria or nuclei ) .",
    "we also suggested a new procedure to experimentally determine values for on - rates from monitoring cell motion ( cf . ) .",
    "in contrast to the off - rate , which can be measured e.g.  from dynamic force spectroscopy experiments , it is very difficult to infer values for the on - rate @xmath49 in cell adhesion , where both partners have to be attached to appropriate surfaces . here",
    ", also one could make use of recent developments in nanotechnology . as we have shown above",
    ", the ligand - to - ligand distance @xmath97 is a crucial control parameter in our system .",
    "recently , is has become possible to control this parameter using nanopatterend and biofunctionalized arrays of gold dots @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the future our predictions regarding the effect of ligand positioning might be compared directly to experimental data , especially if compared with a measurement of the rotational degrees of freedom .    for conceptual and computational simplicity ,",
    "here we have used the bell model for the force dependence of the off - rate @xmath50 . in principle",
    ", it would be easy to include more complicated rupture scenarios , like the catch - slip behavior recently reported for both p- and l - selectin @xcite .",
    "there is good reason to believe that this molecular behavior is essential for the physiological function of these molecules and different theoretical models have been suggested to explain this behavior @xcite .",
    "if combined with our modeling framework for adhesive dynamics , these models might be tested against experimental data from flow chamber experiments .",
    "such an approach would have the big advantage that it avoids testing single molecules outside their physiological environment , which is especially problematic for adhesion receptors which usually are embedded in the plasma membrane and regulated by the cytoskeleton .",
    "further possible extensions of our simulation framework include models for cell deformability and hydrodynamic interactions between cells .",
    "cell deformations in free flow should become relevant only at shear rates well above 100 hz @xcite .",
    "in adhesion , cell deformation depends also on the number and strength of adhesion bonds . in the case of strong adhesion",
    ", it is well known that also viscoelastic changes occur , including elongation of microvilli @xcite . for computational and conceptual simplicity , here we have focused on the case of moderate shear flow and adhesion , when the effect of cell deformability is small .",
    "moreover deformations are irrelevant for rigid microbeads , which have been shown to results in similar physical effects as described for cellular systems @xcite . in order to combine elastic effects and hydrodynamics ,",
    "a very powerful framework is provided by multi - particle collision dynamics @xcite , which in principle also would allow to include non - laminar flow conditions and hydrodynamic interactions between cells .",
    "however , these effects can be safely avoided in flow chamber experiments by using sufficiently small shear rates and cell numbers .",
    "as explained above , an elegant way to test our theoretical predictions experimentally would be the combination of appropriately coated microbeads with nano - structured substrates .",
    "finally we comment on the applicability of our approach to other systems that are based on the stochastic interplay between transport and adhesion . in the work presented here ,",
    "we have considered a situation where receptor and ligands are both tethered to macroscopic surfaces .",
    "however , similar physical processes are relevant if the two molecular binding partners are free in solution , for example in affinity measurements @xcite or shear - induced adhesion of blood - clotting factors @xcite .",
    "another biological system for which the concepts for bond formation , bond rupture and transport discussed here can be applied is the cargo transport by multiple molecular motors @xcite .",
    "compared with rolling adhesion , the cell is replaced by the cargo ( e.g. , a vesicle ) , the cell - anchored receptors by molecular motors and the substrate - anchored ligands by binding sites on the filament .",
    "in contrast to the case of rolling adhesion , now the system is not driven by some external force , but the molecular motors actively step forward and pull their cargo against an external viscous friction force .",
    "our approach can also be applied to non - biological systems .",
    "for example , it is well known that erratic motion also occurs in the context of sliding friction .",
    "a flat slider that is pulled above a plain wall exhibits stick - slip motion in some range of the pulling velocity .",
    "it was shown recently that this special kind of motion can be explained assuming the stochastic formation and rupture of molecular bonds between the slider and the wall @xcite .",
    "thus the stick - slip motion of sliding friction and the erratic movement of cells in rolling adhesions seem to be based on the similar physical principles .",
    "this work was supported by the center for modeling and simulation in the biosciences ( bioms ) and the cluster of excellence cell networks at heidelberg .",
    "additional support came from the minerva foundation through a short term research grant for cbk .",
    "we thank ronen alon and the members of his group for many interesting discussions on rolling adhesion .",
    "the sphere s motion is described by .",
    "if no bond between the sphere receptors and wall ligands exists , we take for the direct force @xmath11 only gravity into account , i.e. , the six - dimensional force and torque vector is given by @xmath108 with @xmath109 the earth acceleration constant .",
    "receptor - ligand bonds lead to additional contributions to both the force- and momentum - part of @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , a bond between a ligand located at @xmath58 and a receptor located at @xmath57 on the sphere s surface ( see ) pulls with a force @xmath110 @xmath111 is the force extension curve that describes by what force the bond must be pulled to stretch it up to a total length @xmath32 . here , we consider the bonds to be semi - harmonic springs ( cable model ) @xmath112 with @xmath113 the resting length and @xmath114 the spring constant .",
    "the cable model is the simplest model for polymeric tethers . in the cable model",
    "a bond behaves as a spring only if it is stretched ( extension larger than the resting length ) , otherwise the bond exerts no force on the sphere . treating the receptor - ligand complex as a harmonic spring works fine in the small extension regime @xcite . for large extensions the force extension curve for polymers",
    "is supposed to grow much faster than linear , and when the bond extension approaches the total contour length of the receptor - ligand complex it even diverges ( strain stiffening ) .",
    "however , typical bonds are weak and their rupture probability increases exponentially with force .",
    "therefore , we expect bond extensions to be restricted to the linear regime . as the bond force pulls on the sphere s surface",
    "also a torque results @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the connection vector from the center of the sphere to the point on its surface where the receptor is attached ( see ) .",
    "thus , the total force and torque contribution to @xmath11 by the bonds is @xmath117 with @xmath66 the total number of receptors and @xmath118 if the @xmath119th receptor forms a bond and zero otherwise .",
    "the @xmath120 are stochastic variables .",
    "thus , the contribution lets the direct force @xmath11 also become a stochastic variable .",
    "* the sphere s position and orientation is updated according to ( for an explicit description see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "the receptor positions in the flow chamber coordinate system are calculated . *",
    "each inactive receptor is represented by a capture ball with radius @xmath121 . *",
    "if the distance between a receptor and any ligand is @xmath122 a bond is established with probability @xmath123 , then the resting length of the bond is set to the receptor - ligand distance at the instance of bond - formation ( i.e. , the bond force at the moment of bond formation is zero ) and is stored together with the ligand position .",
    "a bond can only be formed if the corresponding receptor and ligand are not already part of another bond .",
    "* for each active bond , the contribution to @xmath11 is calculated .",
    "* each existing bond dissociates with a rate given by the bell equation , .",
    "thus , each bond ruptures with probability @xmath124 , where @xmath53 is the instantaneous force acting along this bond .",
    "when a bond has ruptured , both the receptor and the ligand can form a new bond in the next time step according to the rule ( iv ) .",
    "as for the resting length @xmath113 of a bond always @xmath125 is true , modeling bonds as harmonic springs in both the extension and compression regime would not make much difference to the results that are obtained by the cable model .",
    "given the probability for bond formation or rupture @xmath126 or @xmath127 , respectively , a standard monte - carlo technique is used to decide whether the action happens or not : using a pseudo - random number generator a random number @xmath128 from the uniform distribution in the interval @xmath129 $ ] is drawn . if then @xmath130 the respective action takes place , otherwise not ."
