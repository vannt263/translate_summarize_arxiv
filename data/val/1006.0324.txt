    "we will be exclusively dealing with the t  hooft limit @xmath4 const .",
    "as is well known , the attractive interaction gives rise to a marginally bound scalar fermion - antifermion state ( the @xmath5-meson ) with mass 2@xmath3 and to a rich variety of multi - fermion bound states ( baryons ) @xcite .",

    "it is of interest not only as a toy model for strong interaction particle physics , but also because of its almost literal recurrence in condensed matter systems such as conducting polymers , carbon nanotubes or quasi - one - dimensional superconductors @xcite . in the large @xmath0 limit",

    "the boosted baryon was considered , demonstrating a covariant energy - momentum relation and deriving exact structure functions as fermion momentum distributions in the infinite momentum frame @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we proceed to the next level of complication and study baryon - baryon scattering , an issue which has not yet been discussed in any detail in the large @xmath0 limit .",

    "composite , relativistic bound states , we hope to get further insights into the mathematical structure of the gn model by enlarging the spectrum of questions addressed in the framework of the tdhf approach .    before embarking on this problem , it may be worthwhile to recapitulate some of the experience gained with previous applications of the hf approach .",
    "the basic mathematical problem can be formulated in a single line as @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are @xmath8-number spinors ( single particle wave functions ) .",

    "this yields two space - time independent self - consistency conditions , @xmath14 known type ii solutions are the kink - antikink baryons @xcite , the kink crystal at finite temperature @xcite and the time - dependent breather @xcite to be discussed below in more detail .",
    "incidentally , all hf solutions of the massive gn model ( i.e. , lagrangian ( [ i1 ] ) supplemented by a term @xmath15 ) are also of type ii @xcite , and no solution of type iii or higher is known in the gn model which would require more than two functions and hence more than two space - time independent self - consistency conditions . as will become clear later on ,",
    "this classification of hf solutions is useful if one wants to relate the quantum theory to classical gn models with a small number of flavors .    in this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the dynamics of kinks , supplementing the known single kink and kink crystal solutions by kink - antikink scattering and briefly commenting on the generalization to @xmath0 kinks and antikinks .",
    "it turns out that this restriction to kink dynamics is at the same time a restriction to type i hf solutions . for this class of",
    "particularly simple ( though exact ) solutions of the large @xmath0 , massless gn model , we will identify an effective bosonic theory whose soliton solutions are closely related to self - consistent hf potentials , using methods developed by neveu and papanicolaou in their proof of integrability of the classical one- and two - flavor gn models @xcite .",
    "the relevant equation is the sinh - gordon equation , the hyperbolic version of the more familiar sine - gordon equation .",

    "[ sect5 ] we summarize our findings and identify promising directions for future work .",
    "our starting point is the kink - antikink breather solution of the gn model discovered by dashen , hasslacher and neveu ( dhn ) @xcite .",
    "since the inverse scattering method is not available for time - dependent semi - classical solutions , these authors had to guess the scalar potential by analogy with the well - known sine - gordon breather .",
    "they then show that a self - consistent solution can be found whose quantized fluctuations yield the spectrum of kink - antikink type baryons . at the end of their paper ,",
    "dhn mention that the imaginary choice @xmath17 of a certain parameter governing the frequency of the breather should describe scattering of a kink - antikink pair with velocities @xmath18 in their center - of - mass ( cm ) frame .",
    "we take up this suggestion here and analyze the scattering of a kink and an antikink in greater depth , using the language of the tdhf approach . before doing this however , let us review the results for the dhn breather which are relevant for the analytic continuation in @xmath19 .",
    "this is also necessary because the formulae given in @xcite do not seem to be fully consistent , either due to typos or to some unspecified conventions .",

    "the scalar potential can be written as @xmath23 with @xmath24 the parameters appearing here are defined and related as follows , @xmath25 @xmath26 is the solution of the equation @xmath27 where we choose the positive square root .",
    "@xmath9 is fully specified if the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath28 are given .",
    "the dirac equation ( [ 1 ] ) with potential ( [ 3 ] ) has two types of solutions .",
    "first , there is a continuum of wave - like solutions of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 . like in the single baryon problem ,",
    "these scattering states have no reflected wave , showing that also the time - dependent potential is transparent .",

    "@xcite , but one can easily check that eqs .",
    "( [ 7],[9 ] ) do solve the dirac equation .",
    "the second type of solution are bound states .",
    "dhn find two distinct states which can be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath35 two orthogonal solutions of the dirac equation are @xmath36 here , our coefficients @xmath37 differ from those of dhn in the overall signs of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "self - consistency of this solution can be established as follows : dhn find that @xmath40 for each occupied continuum state yields two contributions , one proportional to @xmath9 and one proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "the discrete states yield only a single contribution proportional to @xmath41 . by relating the parameter @xmath28 to the occupation fraction of the discrete states ,",
    "one gets a self - consistent result where the @xmath41 terms cancel . according to the classification of tdhf solutions given in the introduction ,",
    "this shows that the breather is a type ii solution of the gn model . only for the value @xmath42",
    ", the contributions proportional to @xmath41 would vanish and the breather would be a type i solution .",
    "however @xmath42 is ruled out since it is incompatible with a real potential @xmath9 .",
    "we now turn to the kink - antikink scattering problem . following the suggestion of dhn",
    ", we analytically continue the above breather solution to the value @xmath17 .",
    "this gives rise to the following changes in our formulae for the potential and the spinors , @xmath43 the continuum states now have to be normalized to free spinors at @xmath44 using @xmath45 the discrete states are square integrable and normalized to 1 by @xmath46 let us now consider the issue of self - consistency for the scattering problem .",
    "the contribution from the negative energy ( @xmath47 ) continuum to the scalar potential is found to be @xmath48 with @xmath49 the first term by itself gives the self - consistent result owing to the vacuum gap equation , @xmath50 this observation is the same as for the breather .",
    "differences arise in the treatment of the discrete states .",
    "since there are two orthogonal bound states , there is an ambiguity how to fill these states in the tdhf approach .",
    "dhn argue that in the case of the breather one should take the linear combinations @xmath51 and fill them with @xmath0 and @xmath52 fermions , respectively .",
    "we have to reconsider this prescription in the light of the scattering problem .",
    "appropriate initial conditions for the tdhf equation are an incoming kink and antikink with prescribed baryon numbers . in order to prepare such an initial state",
    ", we need to know which linear combinations of the two bound states goes over into the kink or antikink ( zero - energy ) valence state for @xmath44 .",
    "likewise , in order to be able to interpret the final state of the scattering process , we need the corresponding analysis at @xmath53 .",
    "consider an arbitrary ( normalized ) linear combination of @xmath54 , @xmath55 in order to exhibit the asymptotic behavior of this wave function for @xmath56 , we introduce labels for the incoming / outgoing wave from / to the left / right as follows , @xmath57 using this shorthand notation , we find the asymptotic expressions ( omitting a common normalization factor @xmath58 ) @xmath59 with @xmath60 we introduce two orthonormal discrete states with parameters ( @xmath61 ) and ( @xmath62 ) and occupation @xmath63 . in order to match the initial conditions of the kink - antikink scattering problem , we require that state 1 has only incident fermions from the left and state 2 only incident fermions from the right .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) then imply the two pairs of homogeneous , linear equations @xmath64 the conditions for the existence of a non - trivial solution , @xmath65 are indeed satisfied for arbitrary @xmath66 .",
    "we can then determine the ratios @xmath67 , @xmath68 the right - hand side is purely imaginary .",
    "this implies a vanishing contribution to the chiral condensate from the discrete states which is proportional to @xmath69 , as can easily be checked .",
    "self - consistency in the scattering problem is therefore only possible for @xmath42 . in this particular case ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath70 are @xmath71 so that eqs .",

    "the valence fermions are exchanged between the two scatterers , presumably a consequence of the fact that the potential is transparent .",
    "these valence fermions do not play any role in the self - consistency issue .",
    "we can prescribe the number of valence quarks independently for kink and antikink as @xmath63 where @xmath74 . in the final state ,",
    "@xmath63 are then simply exchanged .",

    "expressed in terms of reduced fermion number @xmath77 , the scattering process thus reads @xmath78 the time delay @xmath79 is independent of the fermion numbers and negative , indicating a repulsive interaction between kink and antikink .",
    "note that the value @xmath42 implies that the kink - antikink scattering solution is of type i and hence significantly simpler than the breather .",

    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] exhibit the baryon density for baryon - antibaryon and baryon - baryon scattering . in the first case one clearly sees the exchange of fermions during the collision .",
    "a big hurdle in applying the tdhf approach is to find the self - consistent potential .",
    "obviously it would be extremely nice if one could write down a closed equation satisfied by the potential .",
    "this has been achieved approximately in the case of the massive chiral gn model near the chiral limit , using the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "such classical field equations may be regarded as equations of motion of an effective scalar theory where the fermions have been  integrated out \" , in the language of the path integral .",
    "the derivative expansion is of little use in the discrete chiral gn model where the baryons remain localized in the chiral limit .",
    "here we address the question whether one can nevertheless identify an effective bosonic theory for the non - chiral gn model .",
    "since the tanh kink appears in @xmath91 theory , one may be tempted to postulate the equation @xmath92 it is indeed solved by the boosted kink @xmath93 . however , this can not be correct because eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) has no solitons in the strict sense of the word : if one scatters a kink and an antikink , a numerical study shows that they interact inelastically and do not keep their @xmath94 shape @xcite .",
    "a simple bosonic theory which does not have this problem can be found for type i solutions only , to which we restrict ourselves in this section .",
    "these solutions are specific for kink dynamics ( kink , kink crystal , kink - antikink scattering ) , and therefore only exist in the massless gn model . for type i solutions we can write @xmath95 for every occupied state @xmath96 with nonvanishing @xmath97 .",

    "a full analytical solution has uncovered an interesting interplay between the scalar potentials of kink and antikink which repell each other and the fermion constituents which travel in one direction only , being exchanged during the collision . from a technical point of view , we have found that unlike our starting point , the dhn breather , the scattering solution belongs to the simple class of type i solutions in which each single particle orbit contributes a term proportional to the full self - consistent potential @xmath238 to the chiral condensate .",
    "this complements earlier known solutions of type i , the vacuum , the kink and the kink crystal .",
    "type i solutions are singled out by the fact that the tdhf equations reduce to a non - linear dirac equation . in this way we were able to make contact with earlier studies of the classical @xmath98 gn model and take advantage of the techniques which have been developed there .",
    "we have reproduced the finding of neveu and papanicolaou that the square of the self - consistent potential is related to the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "the linearized version of the latter equation is nothing but the klein - gordon equation for the @xmath5 meson of the gn model .",
    "this supports a skyrme - type picture of the baryon in the non - chiral gn model .",
    "all presently known type i solutions can be identified ( up to a trivial sign ambiguity ) with well - known solitons of the sinh - gordon equation , an observation which would have saved a lot of guesswork , had it been known before .",
    "even more interesting is perhaps the fact that @xmath0 soliton solutions and the lax representation of the associated linear problem are known explicitly for the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "this should enable us to generalize the two - soliton solution of the present paper to the scattering problem of @xmath0 composite , relativistic bound states .",

    "@xcite are also developed for the @xmath239 classical gn model , relevant for type ii solutions of the large @xmath0 quantum theory .",
    "here however , the formalism is significantly more involved , and one apparently needs coupled , non - linear differential equations for several functions , including the scalar potential .",
    "so far we have not yet mentioned the chiral gn model or nambu  jona - lasinio model in 2 dimensions ( njl@xmath133 ) . in the massless njl@xmath133 model ,",
    "transparent potentials appear in the context of the massless baryon @xcite and the shei bound state @xcite .",
    "generalizations to periodic , finite gap potentials include the chiral spiral @xcite and the twisted kink crystal @xcite .",
    "basar and dunne have identified the non - linear schrdinger equation as the relevant equation for the hf potential , using completely different techniques from the ones employed in the present paper . in the massive njl@xmath133 model ,",
    "approximate results from the derivative expansion indicate that the sine - gordon equation is relevant near the chiral limit , but needs to be replaced by increasingly complicated , higher order differential equations with increasing bare fermion mass @xcite . here , the baryon potentials are apparently not transparent , so that we are dealing with neither type i nor type ii solutions , nor with solutions of any finite type , for that matter .",
    "the common theme of all of these efforts is the search for a closed , classical theory of the self - consistent potential , the relevant saddle point in the functional integral approach . in a sense",
    ", one might identify this effort with the search for witten s  master field \" in the large @xmath0 limit of quantum chromodynamics @xcite where unfortunetely little progress has been made until now .",
    "the close relationship between the gn model and the sinh - gordon equation gave us the clue for yet another kind of mapping .",
    "it is known that the sinh - gordon model and strings in ads@xmath16 are related by some kind of gauge transformation , using the pohlmeyer reduction . in the same vein",
    ", we have constructed a gauge transformation mapping type i gn solutions onto classical strings in ads@xmath16 .",
    "although this has nothing to do with the celebrated ads / cft correspondence , it is rather intriguing . when mapping the sinh - gordon model to string theory , one has to use artificial spinor fields from the associated lax pair . in our case ,",
    "the spinors have a more direct physical meaning as tdhf solutions .",
    "another difference to the string / sinh - gordon correspondence is a singularity in the gauge transformation at the zeros of @xmath9 .",
    "this yields folded strings whose spikes must always lie on the boundary of ads@xmath16 .",
    "the existence of such a mapping seems to be closely related to the symmetries of the models .",
    "however , the fact that two models have the same symmetry is in general not sufficient to conclude that their dynamics is the same .",
    "here we have shown how to map a fermionic quantum field theory in the large @xmath0 limit onto a classical string theory in a fully explicit manner .",
    "whether this is of any practical use remains to be seen .",
