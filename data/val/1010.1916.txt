    "the feature of mbius point symmetry group of an equation is synonymous with the presence of this group s differential invariant , the _ schwarzian derivative _ , or in the discrete setting the _ cross - ratio_. schwarzian forms of integrable partial differential equations appeared first in the work of weiss through the painlev analysis @xcite as the _ singularity manifold equation _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for a review of the continuous and discrete schwarzian",
    "integrable systems see @xcite .",
    "the discrete kdv - type equations were classified using the multidimensional consistency integrability criterion in pioneering work of adler , bobenko and suris ( abs ) in @xcite ( cf .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new variable associated with these equations .",
    "it is defined up to the action of the mbius group , and is therefore characterised by schwarzian systems .",
    "we will focus on the contribution this new definition makes to the transformation theory of these equations .",
    "it can be useful to partition the abs list of equations into two parts . in the first part we put equations which are equivalent to the older nqc equation @xcite and its parameter sub - cases , namely q3@xmath0 , q1 , a2 , a1 , h3@xmath0 and h1 in the nomenclature of @xcite .",
    "although all abs equations share the core characteristic of multidimensional consistency , there are several features of the nqc - type equations which do not directly transfer to the second part of the abs list .",
    "one such feature is the connection to a discrete kp - type equation .",
    "inherent from the author s approach the nqc equation was connected with the discrete kp - type equation obtained in @xcite , specifically the natural embedding of the former equation in three dimensions satisfies the latter .",
    "this fulfils the expectation of dimensional reduction that is familiar from the continuous theory .",
    "it is an important feature ; revealing the wider natural context for the integrable systems . for the second and newer part of the abs list , namely equations q4",
    ", q3@xmath1 , q2 , h3@xmath1 and h2 , the connection with a discrete kp - type equation should be expected , but does not appear in the direct way as for the nqc case .",
    "this is resolved on the level of the variable introduced here , because for all abs equations the new variable satisfies the lattice schwarzian kp equation in three dimensions .",
    "the schwarzian construction also enables us to systematically connect all equations on the abs list , with the exception of q4 , to the lattice schwarzian kdv equation .",
    "this complements several relationships of miura and bcklund type which are already known @xcite .",
    "it also shows that allowing for this class of transformations there are at most two distinct abs equations , which provides a discrete counterpart to the result of @xcite .",
    "a virtue of the transformation to the schwarzian variable is a generalised transitivity property which means the transformation inherently captures also the _ difference _ between the equations which it connects .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "many elements of the construction are introduced on the level of the riccati equation in section [ ode ] .",
    "section [ abt ] contains the definition of the schwarzian variable in the context of the riccati equations associated with the bcklund transformations of the discrete kdv - type equations .",
    "the definition is extended to higher dimensions in section [ 3d ] .",
    "the q4 situation is considered in section [ adler ] and the remaining systems of @xcite in section [ degens ] . in the final section",
    "we describe what happens when we apply the definition to systems of consistent polynomials less symmetric than those of @xcite by considering several examples .",
    "consider the scalar discrete riccati equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are values of the dependent variable @xmath5 as a function of the independent variable @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are non - autonomous coefficients of the polynomial @xmath8 .",
    "the values of the variable @xmath9 are naturally associated with the vertices of a one - dimensional lattice , and the polynomial @xmath8 connects consecutive vertices and so is naturally associated with the edges . a degenerate situation occurs if the polynomial on some edge is reducible , we will assume explicitly that this is not the case , specifically that @xmath10 where we have introduced the convenient notation @xmath11 for partial differentiation of the polynomial with respect to its @xmath12 argument .",
    "there is a close relationship between the riccati equation and the group of mbius transformations , @xmath13 this is more discernible if we reformulate ( [ gr ] ) as an equation for a function @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the values of the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are naturally associated to the vertices and edges respectively of the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the virtue of the reformulation ( [ mr ] ) is that both of these functions take values in the group @xmath19 .",
    "the equations ( [ gr ] ) and ( [ mr ] ) are equivalent in the sense that from the general solution of one we may construct the general solution of the other .",
    "this is clear because given @xmath17 satisfying ( [ mr ] ) , @xmath20 satisfies ( [ gr ] ) for any constant @xmath21 .",
    "and conversely , if the general solution of ( [ gr ] ) is known , then certainly three particular solutions are known , say @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and writing @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 determines uniquely a function @xmath17 satisfying ( [ mr ] ) . note that constants other than @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 would also be fine , provided they were distinct , however this choice results in the convenient expression @xmath31 by @xmath32 we mean the unique function @xmath33 taking the value in @xmath19 which is the group inverse of the value of @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that letting @xmath9 take values in @xmath34 is now more obviously natural because elements of @xmath19 permute this set .",
    "we now introduce the object of principal concern , a function @xmath35 associated with ( [ gr ] ) which is defined in terms of a fixed but as yet un - specified function @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath17 is a solution of ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ mr ] ) is unique up to the transformation @xmath38 for arbitrary @xmath39 , and therefore the definition ( [ phidef ] ) determines @xmath40 up to the transformation @xmath41 .",
    "this connects the definition ( [ phidef ] ) with the following one - dimensional schwarzian difference equation : @xmath42(w)}-{[{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}}\\cdot{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}]({\\tilde}{w})})({{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}}({\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{w}})}-{{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{w}}}})}{({[{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}}\\cdot{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}\\cdot{\\mathsf{r}}](w)}-{{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}}({\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{w}})})({[{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}}\\cdot{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}]({\\tilde}{w})}-{{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{{\\tilde}{w}}}})}}}.\\label{seq}\\ ] ] here we have simply evaluated the cross - ratio of four consecutive values of @xmath40 , the right - hand - side follows by substituting for @xmath40 from ( [ phidef ] ) and using ( [ mr ] ) together with the mbius invariance of the cross - ratio , therefore ( [ seq ] ) is a consequence of our definition .",
    "however this equation actually _ characterises _ @xmath40 because any two solutions of ( [ seq ] ) are mbius related : observe first , the equation is invariant under mbius transformations on @xmath40 , and second , the equation is third order , which ensures the existence of a mbius transformation sending any set of well - posed initial data to any other .",
    "notice that the right - hand - side of ( [ seq ] ) does not depend on @xmath17 , so solving this equation obtains @xmath40 without requiring first the solution of ( [ gr ] ) .",
    "there is however the following subtlety : from the definition ( [ phidef ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath40 is constant if and only if @xmath43 is a solution of ( [ gr ] ) , whereas the equation ( [ seq ] ) becomes ambiguous in this situation .",
    "so definition ( [ phidef ] ) is the more robust .",
    "we remark that the @xmath40 variable can play a useful role when only two particular solutions of ( [ gr ] ) are known .",
    "if we label the known solutions @xmath23 and @xmath24 then the associated variable @xmath40 may be found by integration of the homogeneous linear equation @xmath44 this equation is the result of combining ( [ invs ] ) and ( [ phidef ] ) and demanding @xmath22 also satisfy ( [ gr ] ) .",
    "solving ( [ hle ] ) obtains @xmath40 from @xmath23 and @xmath24 . once a particular solution of ( [ hle ] ) is known ( excluding @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) we can again combine ( [ invs ] ) and ( [ phidef ] ) to reconstruct solution @xmath22 , and thus the general solution of ( [ gr ] )",
    ". therefore if two particular solutions are known , the transformation to the variable @xmath40 reduces ( [ gr ] ) to the homogeneous linear equation ( [ hle ] ) . ] .    to conclude this preliminary section let us re - iterate that our intention so far has been to establish , separately from further considerations , a basic definition of @xmath40 , its mbius invariance , as well as some explicit formulae .",
    "this is to emphasise aspects of the construction which are present already at the level of the riccati equation .",
    "they can be distinguished from features like the choice of @xmath43 , a function which has thus far played a rather passive role but which is important later .",
    "well known bcklund transformations for discrete kdv - type equations are of the following generic form @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are autonomous polynomials of degree one in four variables , @xmath50 are dependent variables and @xmath51 denote shifts on these variables in the two lattice directions .",
    "such bcklund transformations connect quadrilateral lattice equations in @xmath52 and @xmath9 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are also autonomous polynomials of degree one in four variables .",
    "the key property we assume is the consistency of the polynomials when associated to the faces of a cube as described in @xcite - the polynomials @xmath54 and @xmath55 here lie on opposite faces .",
    "choosing @xmath52 to satisfy the equation on the left in ( [ geqs ] ) results in the compatibility of ( [ gbt ] ) as a system for @xmath9 , and the function @xmath9 which emerges as the solution of this system then satisfies the equation on the right in ( [ geqs ] ) .",
    "in the theory of such systems developed in @xcite the following polynomials play a fundamental role : @xmath56 the first two of these arise in the non - degeneracy condition for ( [ gbt ] ) as riccati equations for @xmath9 : @xmath57 if these conditions hold the solution @xmath52 is said to be non - singular .    if @xmath52 is a non - singular solution of the equation on the left in ( [ geqs ] ) , then the riccati equations for @xmath9 in ( [ gbt ] ) can be reformulated as the equivalent system @xmath58 for a function @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 are the mbius transformations @xmath61 and @xmath62 defined by ( [ gbt ] ) , which are naturally associated to the edges of the quadrilateral lattice .",
    "the values of @xmath17 are associated to the vertices .",
    "compatibility of ( [ ssys ] ) means simply that @xmath63 .",
    "this reformulation allows the definition of a schwarzian variable @xmath40 associated with a non - singular solution of the equation defined by @xmath54 :    [ mudef ] let @xmath64 be a fixed solution of the system @xmath65 and @xmath66 be a non - singular solution of the equation on the left in ( [ geqs ] ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath40 as the schwarzian variable associated to @xmath52 if @xmath67 for some @xmath59 satisfying the bcklund system ( [ ssys ] ) .",
    "we denote the set of all such pairs of functions @xmath68 by @xmath69 .",
    "the solution of ( [ ssys ] ) is unique up to the transformation @xmath70 for arbitrary @xmath39 .",
    "thus if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 if and only if there exists @xmath39 such that @xmath73 .",
    "although it is immediate from the definition , this is a key property of the relation @xmath69 , in particular it has the consequence that @xmath74 property ( [ muprop ] ) is a generalisation of transitivity to the situation where the domain of the relation is different than the co - domain .",
    "it induces a partition on both domain and co - domain , and the relation lifts to a bijection between the equivalence classes . in the co - domain",
    "this is simply partition by mbius equivalence , whereas the partition of the domain reveals a kind of symmetry of the equation defined by polynomial @xmath54 .    based on the established mbius invariance of the co - domain of @xmath69",
    ", we will further investigate this set of functions using the cross - ratio .",
    "the cross - ratio of four values of @xmath40 around an elementary quadrilateral is found to be @xmath75(w)-{\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}_2({\\tilde}{w}))({\\hat}{{\\mathsf{r}}}_1({\\hat}{w})-{{\\hat}{{\\tilde}{w}}})}{([{\\hat}{{\\mathsf{r}}}_1\\cdot{\\mathsf{r}}_2](w)-{\\hat}{{\\mathsf{r}}}_1({\\hat}{w}))({\\tilde}{{\\mathsf{r}}}_2({\\tilde}{w})-{{\\hat}{{\\tilde}{w}}})}\\label{s2d}\\ ] ] immediately from definition [ mudef ] . the right - hand - side of ( [ s2d ] )",
    "can be evaluated for particular examples of systems ( [ gbt ] ) , and examining the result will lead to insights about the functions in the co - domain of @xmath69 . more generally , mbius - invariant constraints on @xmath40 can be obtained by considering the cross - ratio of values on any set of four distinct vertices of the lattice , the vertices of a single quadrilateral are the most primitive such set .",
    "we remark that ( [ s2d ] ) evaluates in the generic case , and without any assumption on @xmath43 , to @xmath76 where @xmath77 is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath77 is easily found as a rational expression in the coefficients of @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "there are several ways to express it because the coefficients are themselves related due to the compatibility @xmath63 .",
    "interestingly only its square seems to be expressible symmetrically , and is found to be @xmath82    the choice of the fixed function @xmath43 is an important element of definition [ mudef ] satisfying ( [ wdef ] ) is a solution of the equation on the right in ( [ geqs ] ) which is singular throughout the lattice . ]",
    ", it results in the reducibility of the four terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ s2de ] ) when they are considered as polynomials in the four variables @xmath83 .",
    "note that the analog of this in the generic one - dimensional situation is not clear ; choosing @xmath43 in this way is a possibility particular to the riccati equations defined in terms of the consistent polynomials .",
    "in most cases the bcklund transformation described in the previous section embeds naturally in a three - dimensional system : @xmath84 where now @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 denote shifts in the three lattice directions .",
    "such extended bcklund transformations connect systems in @xmath52 and @xmath9 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are just a relabelling of @xmath54 and @xmath55 from before .",
    "the property required is the consistency of all these polynomials on a four - dimensional hypercube .",
    "the generalisation of the schwarzian variable to this higher dimensional situation is fairly obvious , we give the details here only for clarity",
    ". the generalised definition will be important in order to establish the connection between the two - dimensional systems and the three - dimensional lattice schwarzian kp equation .",
    "we define polynomials @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the natural way extending ( [ biquad ] ) , @xmath94 a solution of the system on the left in ( [ geqs3d ] ) is then said to be non - singular if @xmath95 throughout @xmath96 . if @xmath52 is a non - singular solution of the system on the left in ( [ geqs3d ] ) , then the equations ( [ gbt3d ] ) for @xmath9 can be reformulated as the equivalent system @xmath97 for a function @xmath98 .",
    "this reformulation of the bcklund equations leads naturally to the generalised definition of the schwarzian variable :    [ mudef3d ] let @xmath99 be a fixed solution of the system @xmath100 and @xmath101 be a non - singular solution of the system on the left in ( [ geqs3d ] ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath40 as the schwarzian variable associated to @xmath52 if @xmath67 for some @xmath98 satisfying the bcklund system ( [ ssys3d ] ) .",
    "the extension to higher dimensions is clear . in other words",
    "the schwarzian - variable construction is compatible with the multidimensional consistency .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the generic non - degenerate compatible system of polynomials ( [ gbt ] ) , ( [ geqs ] ) may be taken , without loss of generality , in the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the polynomial @xmath104 thus the polynomials around the cube differ only in the value of parameters , these parameters enter the polynomial through the jacobi elliptic function @xmath105 with modulus @xmath106 .",
    "this is the q4 system in its jacobi parameterisation .",
    "it was originally discovered in @xcite as the superposition principle for bcklund transformations of the krichever - novikov equation @xcite , the jacobi parameterisation was obtained in @xcite .",
    "we will consider the schwarzian variable of the q4 system with the fixed function @xmath43 taken to be @xmath107 here @xmath108 are the independent variables , they are incremented by the shifts @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "note that other solutions of ( [ wdef ] ) are possible , for instance choosing @xmath109 would lead to different results in what follows .",
    "[ q4p1 ] if ( [ gbt ] ) , ( [ geqs ] ) is the q4 system ( [ q4sys ] ) and @xmath43 is the fixed function given in ( [ q4w ] ) , then the following equation holds between a non - singular solution @xmath52 of the equation on the left in ( [ geqs ] ) and its associated schwarzian variable @xmath40 : @xmath110 in which we have used the notation @xmath111    substitute the definition of @xmath78 and @xmath79 into the right - hand - side of ( [ s2d ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this brings ( [ s2d ] ) to the form @xmath112 for _ any _ function @xmath43 , relying only on @xmath113 . the particular choice ( [ q4w ] ) leads to @xmath114 which together with their once - shifted versions can be substituted into ( [ qqqq ] ) resulting in ( [ q4s ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ q4s ] ) is how ( [ s2d ] ) looks in the case of the q4 system .",
    "note that @xmath52 only appears through values on two vertices of a quadrilateral .",
    "the natural extension of the q4 system to higher dimensions is obtained by complementing ( [ q4sys ] ) with the associations @xmath115 whilst the extended singular solution @xmath43 is taken to be @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the third independent variable , which is incremented by the @xmath88 shift .",
    "the higher dimensional consideration of the schwarzian variable associated with the q4 system results in the following :    [ q4p2 ] if @xmath40 is the schwarzian variable associated with the three - dimensional q4 system ( [ q4sys ] ) , ( [ q4sys3d ] ) and fixed function @xmath43 given in ( [ q4w3d ] ) , then it satisfies the equation @xmath118    complement ( [ q4s ] ) with similar relations from the other pairs of lattice directions : @xmath119 they can be found by cyclic permutation , we have used the further notation @xmath120 the left - hand - side of the product of ( [ q4s ] ) , ( [ q4ss ] ) and ( [ q4sss ] ) is exactly the left - hand - side of ( [ skp ] ) .",
    "the right - hand - side of this product is @xmath121 which is equal to 1 .",
    "this is an elliptic function identity which is a consequence of the addition formula for the jacobi @xmath105 function .",
    "the three - dimensional equation ( [ skp ] ) is the lattice schwarzian kp equation .",
    "it was first identified as the discrete analogue of the schwarzian kp equation in @xcite , and is gauge - equivalent to the earlier equation given in @xcite for generic values of the parameters . a geometric - incidence interpretation and connection to the hirota - miwa equation",
    "was established in @xcite .",
    "the remaining systems classified in @xcite are all degenerate cases of the q4 system .",
    "they share the feature that polynomials around the cube differ only in values of parameters , but with the difference that the parameters appear rationally , we denote them by @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 the polynomials and the names they were given in @xcite are reproduced here in table [ list ] .",
    ".the polynomials listed in @xcite which define consistent systems on a cube , where it appears @xmath126 is a constant parameter . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us exhibit a simple example : the fifth entry in table [ therest ] .",
    "the transformation to the schwarzian variable in this non - symmetric case is most fully described as connecting the schwarzian equation to the full system ( [ gbt ] ) , ( [ geqs ] ) : @xmath127 in this instance the mappings described in proposition [ miura2 ] are as follows : @xmath128 here the partition induced by @xmath69 on the set of non - singular solutions of the system on the right in ( [ example2 ] ) is not equivalent to a local symmetry .",
    "we remark that for the fourth entry in table [ therest ] , proposition [ miura2 ] defines an auto - transformation for the lattice schwarzian kdv equation , moreover @xmath129 unlike the transformation of the previous section ( of which the transformation here is a degeneration ) .    loosely speaking ,",
    "the fact that the constraint on functions in the co - domain of @xmath69 is two - dimensional is what leads to the existence of the inverse transformation described in propositions [ miurainv ] and [ miura2 ] .",
    "what tends to happen in more degenerate systems of compatible polynomials is that the transformation to the schwarzian variable reduces dimensionality , specifically @xmath40 is constant along some direction on the lattice , which leads to non - invertibility of the transformation .    as an example of this we take a system which looks very much like those listed in table [ therest ] .",
    "in fact we will consider again the fifth entry of table [ therest ] , but with the roles of @xmath52 and @xmath9 interchanged so that @xmath130 we take the singular solution @xmath131 and again the right - hand - side of ( [ s2d ] ) is _ constant _ and thus independent of the solution @xmath52 , so ( [ s2d ] ) _ can _ be used to characterise the co - domain of @xmath69 .",
    "but this constant is equal to 1 .",
    "examination of ( [ s2d ] ) reveals that this implies either @xmath132 or @xmath133 , and in fact it turns out that _ both _ are true , thus @xmath40 is an oscillating function and all information about the original solution @xmath52 is lost .",
    "therefore the bcklund transformation defined by the fifth entry in table [ therest ] can in this way be distinguished from its inverse ( [ non - example ] ) , and in fact the same feature occurs in all other entries of this table except the fourth .",
    "a more obvious degenerate system is the _ linear _ multidimensionally consistent equation defined by the polynomial @xmath134 whence the compatible system ( [ gbt ] ) , ( [ geqs ] ) is defined by ( [ dsys ] ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "the singular solution is @xmath131 which leads to a schwarzian variable that is _",
    "constant_.    suffice it to say that for systems listed in @xcite but which are not included in table [ therest ] or gauge - related to systems in table [ constwa ] , either @xmath40 is a constant or oscillating function ( like in the examples above ) , or else ( [ s2d ] ) can not be used to characterise the co - domain of @xmath69 because the right - hand - side depends on @xmath52 ( like in the case of q4 described in section [ adler ] ) .",
    "it may be beneficial to apply the schwarzian construction to more examples by considering the new systems of consistent polynomials ( that also appear to be less symmetric around the cube ) which were found recently in @xcite .",
