    "the ly@xmath0 line is a very important diagnostic in a wide range of fields of astrophysics , not the least of which is galaxy formation , providing us with extensive information on redshift , dynamics , kinematics , morphology , etc .",
    "three distinct physical processes result in ly@xmath0 source emission in the context of galaxies : first , ly@xmath0 emission due to photo - ionization of hydrogen atoms by uv radiation from nearby , massive stars and subsequent recombinations may contribute as much as 10% of the total luminosity of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "second , part of the potential energy gained by gas falling into galactic potential wells is converted into cooling radiation .",
    "@xcite find that , at high redshifts , most of this radiation is emitted by gas with @xmath6  k , and consequently @xmath7 in ly@xmath0 alone .",
    "finally , the external , metagalactic uv field , penetrating some ( in case of damped ly@xmath0 systems ) or all ( in case of lyman - limit systems ) of the outer parts of galactic hydrogen `` envelopes '' will also produce some ly@xmath0 radiation through case b recombination . moreover , this uv field can also photo - heat non - self - shielded gas , which subsequently cools , radiating ly@xmath0 @xcite .    over the past years",
    "it has become possible to actually resolve observationally these young , ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies . in several cases ,",
    "the galaxies have been found to be significantly more extended on the sky when observed in ly@xmath0 as opposed to optical bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the complexity and diversity of the systems , in order to correctly interpret observations and make predictions about the properties of young galaxies , it is desirable to develop realistic theoretical and numerical models .    for a number of idealized cases analytical solution are obtainable",
    "@xcite investigated the emergent spectrum of resonantly scattered radiation in the case of a highly optically thick slab of finite thickness but infinite extension , and uniform temperature and density .",
    "@xcite extended this solution to include the possibility of the photons being destroyed ( as by dust ) and injected with arbitrary initial frequency .",
    "@xcite derived a similar analytical expression for spherical symmetry , allowing for isotropic expansion or collapse of the gas , and @xcite examined the spectrum for an isotropically expanding or contracting medium with no thermal motion .",
    "however idealized these configurations may seem , they provide valuable and at least qualitative insight into the characteristics of young galaxies . moreover , they offer direct means of testing numerical methods .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) method has been used for solving radiative transfer ( rt ) problems since the beginning of the 1960s . nevertheless",
    ", though conceptually simple , the demand for strong computer power until quite recently restricted this technique to deal with more or less the same idealized configurations that had already been dealt with analytically .",
    "thus , the majority of previous attempts to model rt in astrophysical situations have been based on strongly simplified configurations of the physical parameters .",
    "only a few authors @xcite considered more general cases .    with the aim of predicting the appearance and properties of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies",
    ", we developed an mc code capable of treating an arbitrary distribution of source ly@xmath0 emission , neutral hydrogen density , temperature , and peculiar velocity of the medium and subsequently applied it to a simulated lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) from a fully cosmological simulation .",
    "the cosmological simulation of the formation and evolution of an individual galaxy was performed using the n - body / hydrodynamical treesph code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the system becomes a milky way / m31-like disk galaxy at @xmath8 and is simulated using @xmath9 particles in total , comprising only smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) and dark matter ( dm ) particles at the initial redshift @xmath10 .",
    "the masses and gravity softening lengths of sph and star particles are @xmath11 and @xmath12 pc , respectively ( @xmath13 ) . for the dm particles the corresponding values are @xmath14 and @xmath15 pc .",
    "the minimum sph smoothing length in the simulation is about @xmath16 pc . for the purposes of the present study , a single simulation output , at @xmath1 , was chosen .",
    "the mc code , used to propagate the photons through the medium , by and large resembles those recently developed by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since it is grid - based  the number of cells typically being 512@xmath17  the physical parameters of interest are first interpolated from the sph particles to the cells of the computational box .",
    "these parameters are the ly@xmath0 emissivity , the temperature @xmath18 , the density @xmath19 of neutral hydrogen , and the three - dimensional velocity field @xmath20 of the gas .",
    "the emission cell of a given ly@xmath0 photon is found by setting the probability of being emitted from a given cell equal to the ratio of the luminosity in that cell to the total luminosity @xmath21 .",
    "the photon is then injected in the line center ( in the reference frame of the fluid element ) from a random point @xmath22 in the cell .",
    "the frequency @xmath23 of the photon is parametrized through @xmath24 , where @xmath25 hz is the line center frequency and @xmath26 is the doppler frequency , with @xmath27 being the thermal atom velocity dispersion ( times @xmath28 ) and the rest of the variables having their usual meanings . in terms of this variable",
    "the injected photon obviously has a frequency of @xmath29 .",
    "the initial direction @xmath30 of the photon follows an isotropic probability distribution .",
    "the optical depth @xmath31 covered by the photon before it is scattered is drawn randomly from the probability distribution @xmath32 , and subsequently converted into a physical distance @xmath33 , where the physical parameters are given by the present cell .",
    "the cross section @xmath34 is given by a voigt profile , i.e.  the convolution of the lorentzian natural line profile and the gaussian thermal broadening of the atoms , resulting in @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ly@xmath0 oscillator strength , and @xmath37 is the voigt function with @xmath38 the ratio between the natural line width @xmath39 hz and the doppler width . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is not analytically integrable , we use the analytic fit given by @xcite .",
    "if the final position @xmath40 of the photon is outside the original cell , the photon is placed at the point @xmath41 of intersection with the face of the cell and the above calculation is redone with the parameters of the new cell , an optical depth @xmath42 , and a frequency lorentz transformed to the bulk velocity of the new cell .",
    "this procedure is repeated until either the originally assigned value of @xmath31 is spent , and the photon is scattered , or it leaves the computational box .      except for a small recoil effect ,",
    "the scattering is coherent in the reference frame of the atom .",
    "however , to an external observer , the non - zero velocity @xmath43 of the atom will shift the frequency of the photon . in the directions perpendicular to @xmath30 , the velocities",
    "@xmath44 will follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "when @xmath45 , the photon barely diffuses spatially .",
    "only when it has diffused sufficiently far in frequency space , will it be able to make a large journey in real space . to skip these non - important core scatterings and thus accelerate the code ,",
    "if @xmath46 is less than some critical value @xmath47 , following @xcite @xmath44 is drawn from a truncated gaussian so as to favor fast moving atoms and artificially push the photon back in the wing .",
    "@xmath47 is determined according to @xmath48 in the given cell .",
    "if @xmath49 , a proper gaussian is used ; otherwise we find that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 or @xmath52 for @xmath53 or @xmath54 , respectively , can be used without affecting the final result .",
    "the effect of this acceleration scheme is a speed - up of several orders of magnitude .    due to the resonance nature of the scattering event , the velocity @xmath55 parallel to @xmath30 depends on @xmath56 , and is generated following @xcite .",
    "the final frequency @xmath57 of the scattered photon ( in the reference frame of the fluid element ) depends on direction in which the photon is scattered . for scattering in the line center , transitions to the @xmath58 state results in isotropic scattering , while the @xmath59 transition causes some polarization , resulting in a probability distribution @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the angle between @xmath30 and the outgoing direction @xmath62@xcite .",
    "since the spin multiplicity is @xmath63 , the probability of being excited to the @xmath59 state is twice as large as being excited to the @xmath58 state state and subsequent destruction of the photon can be neglected . ] . for scatterings in the wing , polarization for @xmath64 scattering",
    "is maximal , resulting in a dipole distribution @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the transition from core to wing scattering is given by the value of @xmath56 where the lorentzian starts dominating the gaussian profile , i.e.  where @xmath66 , or @xmath67 ( the exact value is not crucial ) .",
    "in all cases , the scattering is isotropic in the azimuthal angle @xmath68 . in the observers frame ,",
    "the final frequency is then given by @xmath69 , where the factor @xmath70 @xcite accounts for the recoil effect .      following the above scheme",
    ", the photons are propagated through the medium , one by one , until they escape the computational box . for each scattering ( as well as the emission ) of a photon , the probability that the photon will escape in the direction of six virtual observers situated in the negative and positive directions of the three principal axes is calculated .",
    "this probability is added as a weight to a three dimensional array ( the two spatial dimensions of the projected image of the galaxy , plus a spectral dimension for each pixel ) .",
    "the array is finally collapsed along the spectral dimension and along the spatial dimensions to yield the image and spectrum , respectively , that an external observer would see .",
    "the contribution of each pixel element to the surface brightness ( sb ) is then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of photons , @xmath73 is the luminosity distance to the observer , @xmath74 is the solid angle subtended by the pixel , and @xmath75 is the optical depth of the gas lying between the scattering event and the edge of the computational box in the direction of the observer .",
    "+ the mc code was tested on various simple configurations for which analytic solutions exist , discussed in the introduction .",
    "our code exquisitely passes all tests .",
    "the results of these tests will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the mc code was applied to a proto - galaxy at @xmath1 , consisting of two small , star - forming `` disks '' separated by approximately 2 kpc , on one of which the computational box is centered , and a third more extended disk of lower star formation rate ( sfr ) , located about 15 kpc from the center .",
    "the star - forming regions are embedded in a significant amount of more diffuse , non - star - forming hi gas in a 1015 kpc thick , sheet - like structure , taken to constitute the @xmath56-@xmath76 plane .",
    "the total sfr of the system is 22 @xmath77 yr@xmath3 .",
    "observed lbgs have sfrs in the range 101000 @xmath77 yr@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the simulated galaxy corresponds to a small lbg .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emissivity is produced according the three different scenarios described in the introduction .",
    "specifically , the luminosity originating from the hii in the vicinity of massive stars ( accounting for approximately 90% of @xmath21 ) is determined following @xcite , using the code starburst99 @xcite to yield the lyman continuum and assuming a miller - scalo initial mass function , a mean lyman continuum photon energy of 1.4 rydberg , and that 0.68 ly@xmath0 photons are emitted per photonionization .",
    "the length of the box used for the mc calculations is 50 kpc ( physical ) , and @xmath78 gpc .",
    "[ fig : sbmap ] shows the results obtained ( all with a resolution of @xmath79 cells ) , viewed from two different directions  from the negative @xmath56- and @xmath80-direction , corresponding to an edge - on and a face - on view of the sheet - like structure , respectively .",
    "upper panels assume that the gas is optically thin to the ly@xmath0 line , lower show the corresponding results with resonant scattering included .",
    "the effect of the scattering is incontestable : although the original constellation of the principal emitters is still visible , the surface brightness distribution is clearly much more extended .",
    "moreover , we notice the effect of the viewing angle .",
    "qualitatively , we expect the photons to escape more easily from the face of the sheet than from the edge and hence that the system should have a higher surface brightness than when viewed edge - on . here",
    ", this anticipation is quantified : fig .",
    "[ fig : profspec ] shows the azimuthally averaged sb profiles .    to allow for direct comparison with observations ,",
    "the profiles are also shown not including the luminosity of the emitter lying in the outskirts of the image and smoothed with a psf corresponding to a seeing of @xmath81 .",
    "the maximum sb of the @xmath56-@xmath76 plane is found to be @xmath82 erg s@xmath3 @xmath83 , or @xmath84 times higher than that of the @xmath76-@xmath80 plane .",
    "the average sb , from which the total luminosity is usually derived assuming isotropic emission , is @xmath85 times higher .    finally , we show the emergent spectrum .",
    "though not as clear for the edge - on view , both profiles exhibit the characteristic double - peaked profile ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , this is the result of the high opacity for photons near the line center ; diffusing to either side of @xmath86 quickly decreases @xmath31 so as to make escape more probable .",
    "furthermore , both profiles imply a net inward velocity of the gas ; for infalling gas , red photons are shifted into resonance , while blue photons escape even more easily , thus enhancing the blue peak and diminishing the red .",
    "fitting a `` neufeld profile '' to the observed spectra can give us an idea of the intrinsic characteristica of the system .",
    "unfortunately , there is a degeneracy in that the profile is dependent only on the parameter @xmath87 , assuming some temperature , e.g.  @xmath88 k , representative of most of the ly@xmath0 emitting gas , one could in principle deduce the equivalent column density @xmath89 . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath89 is obtainable due to , e.g. , the presence of a background quasar , constraints can be put on the temperature .",
    "a bulk rotational motion of the gas will also alter the profile . since in fact",
    "a full spectrum is obtained for every pixel element , this effect can be studied through long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the present mc calculations do not include the effect of dust . effectively , dust will act as a photon sink and an extra scattering possibility .",
    "since , on average , each photon scatters @xmath90 times and travel a distance of @xmath91 kpc before escaping ( determined from a non - accelerated run of the code with a few @xmath92 photons ) , approximately half of which is in the high density ( @xmath93 @xmath94 ) , cooler ( @xmath95 k ) regions , even a small amount of dust may be expected to be capable of causing a significant decrease in the observed intensity .",
    "however , it is not clear to which extend the dust will affect the observations . if the medium is clumpy , the ratio of ly@xmath0 to continuum radiation may in fact be increased @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite argued that dust acting as catalysator for hydrogen molecules will lower @xmath19 , making the medium more transparent .",
    "we will study these effects in future work , implementing a realistic model of the dust based on the 8 different metal species kept track of by the cosmological simulation .    as a very recent improvement of the cosmological simulation , a post - processed rt scheme of uv radiation from star - forming regions was developed by @xcite .",
    "they found that up to 510% of the ionizing photons escape these regions at @xmath96 .",
    "however , a very preliminar analysis indicates that the results presented in this work are not significantly changed by the inclusion of h - ionizing photon rt .",
    "the quantative effects of this on ly@xmath0 rt will also be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the developed monte carlo code has reproduced qualitatively _ and _ quantitatively the observation that young galaxies often appear significantly more extended on the sky in ly@xmath0 than in the optical .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the impact of the viewing angle on the observed surface brightness .",
    "future simulations of a large statistical sample of galaxies , taking properly into account dust and h - ionizing uv photon radiative transfer , will allow us to learn more about the enigmatic ly@xmath0 emitters .",
