    "multiwavelength campaigns show that the uv absorber is composed by as much as four or more components with distinct outflow velocities , ranging from few tens to thousands kms@xmath2(e.g .",
    "the outflow velocity is measured as the displacement of the centroid of the absorption line with respect to its wavelength in the rest frame of the source , converted to velocity space .",
    "the x - ray absorbing gas usually shares some of the uv velocity components .",
    "the lower x - ray resolution however allows to assign a range of possible velocities which can be usually associated to multiple uv components with similar velocity .",

    "an ionized gas is phenomenologically parameterized not only by its kinematic components , but also by its ionization and column density .",
    "two similar definitions of the ionization parameter are used .",

    "we will refer to the ionizing parameter as the log of @xmath11 .    in order to find a solution for @xmath11 ,",
    "a ionization balance is needed .",
    "this expresses the balance between the recombination to and the ionization of a given ion and it is dependent on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source .",
    "the ionization balance is calculated using a photoionization code , such as cloudy @xcite or xstar @xcite .",
    "a grid is constructed for a range of values of @xmath11 and n@xmath12 and the best fit searched through a minimizing procedure like the @xmath13 or the @xmath14 statistical tests . in the uv band , this procedure relies on the analysis relatively few ions ( sect .  [",

    "in particular the presence of the iron uta , where virtually all fe ions are represented , helps in securing the parameter determination .",
    "higher ionization ions can be detected only in the x - ray band .",
    "highly ionization components are highlighted mostly by h - like and he - like ions of o , ne , mg , si , s and also fe , detected at very short wavelength ( @xmath15=1.85 and 1.79 for fexxv  and fexxvi , respectively ) .",
    "[ f : high : xi ] shows that the opacity of such gas is modest , unless the column density becomes high ( @xmath16 few@xmath17@xmath18 )",
    ". this observational bias may well be the reason why the higher ionization gas often displays a higher column density",
    ". there could be also low @xmath19 gas which eluded the detection so far .",
    "it is evident however that a larger hydrogen column density is associated with the detected high ionization outflowing gas .",
    "if the uv and x - ray absorbers are co - spacial , this larger column density implies that a larger mass is associated with the x - ray absorber than with the uv absorber . therefore the x - ray gas may play an important role in the budget of material carried away from the black hole .",
    "in general there is a one - to - one relation between objects that show x - ray absorption and those which show uv absorption . in particular , these multiwavelength studies ( table  [ t : list ] ) clearly pointed out that at least one uv gas component shares the same outflow velocity and ionization parameter with one x - ray component .",
    "+ one major problem that confused for a while the interpretation of this phenomenon is the non - correspondence of column density between the gas detected at different frequencies .",
    "however , detailed studies revealed that the two values can be most of the times reconciled if a velocity - dependent partial covering , acting in the uv band , is allowed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the integrated column density of an absorption trough is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the optical depth , @xmath15 is the wavelength of the transition , @xmath22 is the oscillator strength and _ v _ is the velocity .",

    "the corrected column density allowed also a correct estimate of element abundances ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in at least one case , even absolute abundances",
    "could be evaluated @xcite .",
    "x - ray lines do not suffer dramatically from the covering factor effect in these objects , probably because the x - ray source is more compact than the uv continuum , thus the gas can more easily cover our line of sight . in one noticeable case , where the 3rd order of hetg data could be analyzed ( ngc  3783 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the striking similarities between the profile of ly@xmath28 , detected in the uv , and the one of ovii , detected in the x - rays , suggests however that a covering factor could be important also for the x - ray gas ( see fig .  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "for a typical data set , higher dispersion order data , implying an enhanced energy resolution , are of poor quality .",
    "this makes impossible in practice the detection and the analysis of a velocity - dependent covering factor .",
    "+        the phenomenological picture that emerges from the comparison of the absorption features in the two wave bands is that lower ionization warm absorbers are naturally detected in the uv .",
    "these are characterized by e.g. mgii , cii .",
    "then there is a phase which is detected in both bands .",
    "this is characterized e.g. by nv , iv civ , ovi , ovii .",
    "note that oviis the only abundant ion which is simultaneously detected in the fuv and x - rays .",
    "unfortunately ovi , which was successfully studied using fuse in nearby objects ( table  [ t : list ] ) , is out of the reach of the high - resolution instruments now flying on board of hst . ]",
    "finally , there is a high ionization phase ( log@xmath29 ) which can be only detected in the x - rays . + a typical example",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ f : mrk279 ] where both the uv and x - ray representative spectra of mrk  279  are shown .",
    "the uv spectrum displays many velocity components of which only component @xmath30 is shared with the x - rays .",
    "for that component , a full agreement of column density and ionization parameter is found in the two spectral bands @xcite .",
    "lower ionization ions ( e.g. siiii , fig .",
    "[ f : mrk279 ] ) are represented in the uv spectrum only @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the high - ionization component , highlighted mainly by oviii  ( correspondent to a log@xmath31 , black solid line in the upper right panels of fig .",
    "[ f : mrk279 ] ) is only detected in the x - ray band .",
    "in the following i describe what are the important parameters to understand the geometry and distance of the warm absorber .      one of the quest in the study of the warm absorbers is the determination of the hydrogen number density of the gas .",
    "indeed , in both energy bands there is not any straightforward method to obtain this parameter . in the uv ,",
    "the most promising and accurate method is the analysis of meta - stable levels .",
    "these atomic levels are those from which the transition to the ground level is forbidden .",
    "they are populated by collisions , if the number density is above a certain threshold whose value is in turn dependent on the transition .",
    "such experiment has been carried out e.g. using iii ciii@xmath32 and feii@xmath32 . in fig .",
    "[ f : n_levels ] the practical procedure is illustrated .",
    "for each level , the theoretical relative population of the meta - stable level with respect to the ground level is plotted as a function of the number density @xmath6 .",
    "this curve is confronted with each observed relative population .",
    "it is evident that the more transitions are available , the more constrained the value of @xmath6 will be ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the x - rays ,",
    "very few be - like ions ( as iii ciii@xmath32 is ) can be detected .",
    "one of them is ov@xmath32 , whose main transition from the meta - stable level lies at @xmath33 .",
    "this meta - stable level is sensitive only to high densities , therefore it may be not ubiquitous in agn spectra .",
    "a tentative detection has been reported by , implying a number density @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "+ meta - stable levels are sensitive to only a certain range of number densities , depending on the transitions . in principle other methods , like monitoring the variability of the warm absorber in response to the central source variation , would be sensitive to any number density value , provided that the monitoring is carried out on a reasonably extended time base line . if one assumes that recombination is the only mechanism at work when the ionized gas responds to a variation in the ionizing flux , then the number density of the gas is simply inversely proportional to the recombination time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular : + @xmath36}\\right)^{-1},$ ] + where @xmath37 is the recombination rate and @xmath38 is the fraction of element @xmath39 in ionization state @xmath40 .",
    "if there is a change in column density between two epochs , the time interval between the two measurements provides a lower limit on the number density of the gas , leading to an upper limit on the distance of the gas , using the definition for the ionization parameter in sect .",
    "[ par : ion_par ] .",
    "conversely , a non - variation of the warm absorber as a function of the flux change provides a lower limit on the distance .",
    "an ideal situation is when the monitoring happens on different time scales .",
    "this allows to monitor both fast and slow flux changes and as a consequence to explore a wider range of possible densities . in practice",
    "such an ideal monitoring is difficult to perform .",
    "brighter objects , which would provide a high s / n , securing an accurate estimate of the parameters , do not display much variability .",
    "variations are of the order of 30% using typical exposure times .",
    "the physical reason for this lack of dramatic variability is that probably they are larger systems , with larger black hole masses . therefore , unless dedicated monitoring is performed ( e.g. mrk  509 , kaastra et al , in prep . ) , a comparison is done on data sets that are taken at different times , separated by months / years .",
    "those time scales deliver only loose constraints on the number density of the gas .",
    "+ only a handful of experiments were successful in detecting significant variations of the warm absorber .",
    "for example , applying the relation for @xmath41 and for @xmath11 above , @xcite derived an upper limit of @xmath42pc for the distance of the gas in ngc  3783 .",
    "a consistent limit of @xmath43pc has been derived for the same gas component from the analysis of the uv data @xcite . using the variability method on ngc  3516 ,",
    "a distance estimate of 0.2pc has been obtained @xcite .",
    "+ smaller black hole systems , like in the narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies ( nls1 ) , show instead the desired large variation in flux on time scales of few ks .",
    "an intensively studied object in this respect is ngc  4051 . using different instruments , variability studies point to densities which differ of a factor 2040 for a same gas components .",
    "this mismatch underlines the challenge of this kind of analysis on complex spectra , as it relies on time - resolved spectroscopy on short time scales , which reduces the s / n considerably .",
    "+      whether emission and absorption in both uv and x - ray band are produced from the same gas it is not clear .",
    "the main issues are that the two components do not vary on the same time scale and that the width of the lines often do not match between absorbed and emitted lines .",
    "these facts point to a different location with respect to the central source .",
    "a systematic comparison between absorption and emission is often hampered by a low s / n and by the fact that in seyfert  1 galaxies the continuum emission is predominant , favoring the detection of absorption , rather than emission , features .",
    "absorption lines can therefore be compared only with a handful of x - ray emission lines ( typically the ovii  and neix  triplets , and oviii ) which are not always detected . in the uv ,",
    "the emission spectrum is dominated by the broad emission lines whose width ( 2000 - 10,000kms@xmath2 ) can not in general be reconciled with the narrower absorption lines .",
    "two extensively studied sources , ngc  4151 and ngc  5548 recently underwent an historically broad - band low flux . in those occasions , the uv broad lines were absent , revealing the presence of lines with smaller width ( from an intermediate line region , ilr ) , consistently with that measured for the absorption lines .",
    "interpreting this width as due to keplerian broadening , a distance of 0.1 pc for both the emitting and absorbing gas has been derived in ngc  4151 @xcite .",
    "this estimate could be readily applied to the x - ray band absorbing gas , as this shared the same parameters as the uv absorbing / emitting gas .",
    "the case of ngc  5548 did not deliver a similarly simple picture , as the ilr did not have any detected absorption counterpart @xcite . in the x",
    "- rays a direct comparison between absorption and emission has been performed e.g. on ngc  3783 , for which a long xmm-_newton _",
    "exposure allowed such a study .",
    "the similarity of the widths of emission and absorption lines and the lack of variability of the absorption features among other reasons implied a location of the gas in the narrow line region @xcite , in disagreement however with the estimates based on the absorption features .",
    "outflows are of potential crucial importance for the metal enrichment of the surrounding medium ( sect .",
    "[ par : intro ] ) .",
    "the mass for unit time carried away from the system can be expressed as : + @xmath44 + where @xmath45 is the plasma mean molecular weight per proton ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath7 is the radius , @xmath19 is the gas column density , @xmath47 is the proton mass , @xmath48 the global covering factor and @xmath49 the outflow velocity . collecting the values of @xmath50 from classical seyfert  1 galaxies with available distance estimates ( see references in table  1 ) , we see that they range between 0.010.06 @xmath51yr@xmath2 .",
    "these values are often comparable with the mass accretion rate . in some outliers , @xmath52 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for the seyfert  1 considered here , the kinetic luminosity is in general modest : @xmath54%@xmath55 , where @xmath55 is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "taking into account the sources where the @xmath56 value was extracted , a range of @xmath57ergs@xmath2 is obtained .",
    "considering an agn life - time of @xmath58yr , the total energy carried by the outflow is @xmath59erg .",
    "these values , keeping in mind the associated uncertainties , may be comparable to the energy necessary to evaporate the interstellar environment out of the host galaxy ( @xmath60erg , * ? ? ?",
    "an influence of the ionized flows on the intracluster medium and beyond is difficult to assess .",
    "simulations show indeed that only an energy of about @xmath61erg would make the outflows important at intergalactic scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ionized outflows in seyfert galaxies must play a role both in the self - sustenance of the active galactic nucleus and in the chemical enrichment of the environment .",
    "multiwavelength campaigns and dedicated monitoring on interesting objects are key in extracting the most accurate parameters of the outflow . from that , also informations on the energetics of the outflow can be obtained .",

    "the new hst instruments ( cos , stis ) will allow easier density diagnostic studies , thanks to the high throughput . in the x - ray future , ixo will allow large monitoring campaign of warm absorbers in agn , with minimal exposure times .",
