    "given a group @xmath0 one may ask the question :    in what ways can @xmath0 act non - trivially on a gromov hyperbolic metric space ?    many interesting groups can be fruitfully studied via some natural action on a gromov hyperbolic space .",
    "examples include the action of an amalgam or hnn extension on its bass - serre tree , the action of a kleinian group on @xmath1 , and the action of the mapping class group of a surface on the curve complex of that same surface .",
    "alternatively , one can study the space of actions of a fixed group on some ( fixed or varying ) gromov hyperbolic metric space .",
    "for example , the @xmath2character variety of a group parameterizes the space of actions of a fixed group on the hyperbolic space @xmath3 .",
    "analysis of the structure of this variety has led to many remarkable theorems about @xmath4manifolds and their fundamental groups ( for an introduction , see @xcite ) .",
    "a larger `` variety '' ( in scare quotes because there is unlikely to be any algebraic structure ) would describe all non - trivial actions on gromov hyperbolic spaces , up to some appropriate equivalence relation .",
    "we give suggestions for how to define this equivalence relation and topologize the variety in section [ s : actions ] .",
    "briefly , the equivalence relation is that generated by coarsely equivariant quasi - isometric embeddings . this equivalence is coarser than that given by quasi - conjugacy ( as in for instance @xcite ) , but finer than that given by equivariant homeomorphism of limit sets . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on cases in which the set of equivalence classes is particularly simple .",
    "certain equivalence classes of actions on hyperbolic spaces can not be ruled out , or even really analyzed using the tools of negative curvature .",
    "these are the _ actions with an invariant horoball _ ( see section [ ss : combhoro ] for the definition , and theorem [ t : horeq ] for some characterizations ) .",
    "actions with an invariant horoball ( in the sense used in this paper ) are always elementary ; they include the trivial action on a point and actions which preserve some horofunction .",

    "if the factors have rank one , then there will clearly be non - elementary isometric actions of @xmath5 on rank one symmetric spaces .",
    "we discuss this case in section [ section : rankone ] .    for actions by lattices in nontrivial products of simple lie groups ,",

    "this pseudocharacter gives rise to a cobounded action on a space quasi - isometric to @xmath8 , fixing both ends . on the other hand",
