    "from the very beginning , aperiodic tilings have played a significant role in unravelling the mysteries of aperiodic crystals . knowing what is mathematically possible has often turned out to be a crucial element in conceiving what might be physically realizable . in this paper",
    "we discuss two remarkable aperiodic tilings of the plane that are built out of one of the most basic of all crystallographic structures : the standard periodic hexagonal lattice .    also from the very beginning",
    ", there arose the question of what might be the minimum number of different prototiles necessary for a system of tiles and corresponding matching rules that permit , and only permit , aperiodic tilings .",
    "the very first aperiodic tilings involved thousands of prototiles .",
    "the famous aperiodic tilings of the plane like the rhombic penrose and the ammann - beenker tilings are each based on just two prototiles , the allowable motions being translations and rotations .",
    "this of course immediately raises the question of whether aperiodic tilings based on just one prototile are possible .",
    "taylor@xcite and taylor and socolar@xcite introduced a planar aperiodic tiling which can be built from a single hexagonal prototile allowing translations , rotations , and * reflections*. the tiling is based on the familiar hexagonal tiling of the plane , but if one distinguishes the prototile in its direct and reflected forms , then the matching rules allow only aperiodic tilings to appear .",
    "their work revived interest in much earlier work of r. penrose . in @xcite , he had introduced an aperiodic tiling , also based on marked hexagonal tiles , but additionally involving two other types of thin edge tiles and small corner tiles , which he called a @xmath0-tiling .",
    "however , already in this paper he had introduced arrowed double hexagon tiles as an alternative way to represent the tiling , see fig .",
    "[ doublearrowing ] .",
    "later , in his online notes @xcite he expanded upon the double tile theme , and pointed out the essential matching rules that make them work .    in both the taylor - socolar and penrose cases , the ` matching rules ' somewhat stretch the original notion of matching rules , so there can remain some controversy about whether these are strictly aperiodic monotiles .",
    "however , that is not an issue here .",
    "these tilings are interesting , and puzzling too , for although the taylor - socolar hexagonal tilings , henceforth called taylor - socolar tilings or t - s tilings , and the penrose hexagonal tilings ( penrose tilings ) seem deeply related , that relationship is somewhat obscure .",
    "the two tilings are not mutually locally derivable ( mld ) @xcite in the technical sense , but are in mutually derivable in a rather different sense that we shall explain .",
    "in @xcite we put forward a development of the t - s tilings based on the underlying hierarchical system of nested equilateral triangles that are so prominent in both the t - s tilings and the penrose tilings .",
    "the aperiodicity of the tilings comes from this hierarchical structure , and indeed these tilings seem to have been invented with precisely this feature in mind .",
    "the structure of nested triangles has an algebraic interpretation as an inverse system of finite groups , arising from the standard triangular lattice and its natural triangular sublattices , and is closely related to the @xmath1-adic integers . in @xcite",
    "we made this algebraic interpretation the basis out of which we constructed the t - s tilings .",
    "in fact , as long as the nested system of triangles is generic , meaning that it is free of singularities ( like points which are simultaneously the vertices of triangles of unbounded size ) , then there is a unique t - s tiling belonging to it .",
    "we shall see that the same type of mathematics applies to the penrose tilings , and not surprisingly the two inverse systems are deeply connected",
    ".    a more detached look at the double hexagon tilings reveals that they actually incorporate both types of tilings simultaneously .",
    "this association is not entirely new @xcite , but in this paper it is the double hexagon tilings that are taken as the fundamental objects , and they serve as the parents of the two individual types ( penrose and t - s ) of hexagonal tilings .",
    "thus we may think of the two tilings as siblings of each other .",
    "algebraically a double hexagon tiling corresponds to a matched pair of inverse sequences , and with these we can see how the algebra and geometry fit seamlessly to elucidate each other . the paper offers a unified treatment of the two tilings along with proofs of the implied hierarchical structuring and the aperiodicity .",
    "an arrowed hexagon is a regular hexagon in which each side has been given a direction , indicated by an arrowhead .",
    "an arrowed hexagon is called * well - arrowed * if , up to rotation , the arrows form the pattern shown on the right side of fig .",
    "[ doublearrowing ] .",
    "in fact all three hexagons in this figure are well - arrowed .",
    "the structure of the well - arrowed hexagon gives it a well - defined orientation in the plane , namely that provided by the two parallel arrows facing in the same direction .    .",
    "the assumption of * legality * allows completion of the arrowing on the corner hexagons to well - arrowed hexagons , as indicated on the right.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    if we start at any edge of a well - arrowed hexagon and then look every alternate edge as we go around it , we notice that arrows on the three edges always have mixed type of clockwise and counter - clockwise .",
    "we notice also the useful fact that if we have a hexagon and three alternate edges have been arrowed so as to be of mixed type , then there is a unique way to complete the arrowing to make it into a well - arrowed hexagon .",
    "a hexagonal tiling of the plane with well - arrowed hexagons is called * well - matched * if the hexagons meet edge - to - edge and the arrows of these coinciding edges also coincide  that is , they point in the same direction .",
    "we are only interested in well - matched tilings of arrowed hexagons .",
    "a double hexagon tile ( or double hex tile ) consists of a pair of well - arrowed hexagons , one within the other , as shown on the left side of fig .",
    "[ doublearrowing ] .",
    "the inner hexagon is centered within the outer one with its orientation at right - angles to the orientation of the outer one .",
    "its size is chosen so as to make the outer hexagon @xmath2 times the area of the inner hexagon ( so there is a linear scaling factor of @xmath3 ) .",
    "there are , up to rotational symmetry , only two double hexagons ( of any particular size ) , see fig .",
    "[ newdeco - on - penrosetile ] .",
    "when three double hexagons meet at a vertex , the gray parts around the vertex form another hexagon .",
    "we call these types of hexagons * corner hexagons*.    suppose that we have a hexagonal tiling of the plane with double hexagons . by this we mean that we are using the outer hexagons as the tiles .",
    "suppose that from the perspective of the arrowing on the outer hexagons this hexagonal tiling is well - matched .",
    "three outer hexagons meet at every common vertex @xmath4 , and the three edges of the corresponding inner hexagons that are closest to @xmath4 form three edges of a corner hexagon @xmath5 centered on @xmath4 . with the terminology introduced above we can ask whether or not these three arrows are mixed . if they are mixed then we can extend the arrowing to make @xmath5 well - arrowed .",
    "suppose that all the corner hexagons of the tiling can be well - arrowed in this way .",
    "collectively the inner hexagons together with the corner hexagons form another hexagonal tiling of the plane , if we ignore the question of their arrows matching .",
    "however , there does arise the question of whether or not all the common edges of adjacent small hexagons actually do have matching arrows , that is , whether or not this new tiling is well - matched .",
    "the double hexagon tiling is called * legal * if they do .",
    "thus a double hexagon tiling is * legal * if its outer hexagons are well - matched , all of its corner hexagons can be completed to well - arrowed hexagons , and the consequent well - arrowing of the small hexagons completes to a small hexagon tiling of the plane which is well - matched . in this situation",
    "we have two well - matched hexagonal tilings , one using the large hexagons and the other using the small ones inner and corner hexagons .",
    "[ doublehexpatch ] shows a patch of a legal double hexagon tiling .",
    "the double hexagon tiles that we are discussing are also called * penrose hexagonal tiles * , and a legal tiling is a * penrose hexagonal tiling*. we shall use both names in this paper , because within the context of understanding the intimate relationship between penrose hexagonal tilings ( based on the large hexagons ) and taylor - socolar hexagonal tilings ( based on the small hexagons ) , it is convenient at times to simply think in terms of legal double hexagon tilings .",
    "there are other decorations of well - arrowed hexagons and double hexagon tiles that are equivalent representations of the arrowing but help to make the underlying geometry of the tilings more transparent .",
    "the first of these is the marking of well - arrowed hexagons shown in fig .",
    "[ basicarrowedhexagon ] , which replaces the arrows of a well - arrowed hexagon with a black stripe and two black corner markings .",
    "initially we will use this representation of the arrowing with the small hexagons , later for the outer hexagons .",
    "notice that when two well - arrowed hexagons are attached along some edge so that the corresponding arrows match ( i.e. they are well - matched ) , the black markings line up , either stripe to stripe , stripe to corner , or corner to corner , to create an extended black path .",
    "in fact , that the stripes and corner markings match to form extended paths , is exactly the same as arrow matching . in the resulting paths the corner markings indeed serve as corners at which the direction of the path changes . if we have a well - matched tiling of well - arrowed tiles , we will have also a set of paths .",
    "it is easy to see that if , purple in following a path , it turns right or left at a corner , then at its next corner it will turn in the same sense ( again right or again left ) and so the resulting paths will be equilateral triangles ( the corners create @xmath6 angles ) .",
    "the only way this can fail is if there are paths that extend infinitely in some direction along some straight line .",
    "such a tiling is called a * singular * ( or * non - generic * ) tiling . later on we will examine the similar paths created by the stripes and corner markings on the large hexagon tiles , and the same issue of singularity will arise .",
    "the generic situation is that of * non - singular * ( or * generic * ) tilings , that is , all of the paths form triangles . in this paper , in order to keep all the essential ideas clear , we shall always assume non - singularity , though at this point we need it only with the small hexagons and their markings .",
    "the resulting triangles come in various sizes and arrangements , and this is something we address in the next section .",
    "the second decoration is one that we make to double hexagon tiles , replacing the outer arrowing by colored short diagonals ( short diagonals are the ones that pass at right - angles between opposite edges , as opposed to long diagonals that pass from vertex to opposite vertex ) .",
    "this is explained in fig .",
    "[ newdeco - on - penrosetile ] .    )",
    ", we arrive at the fully decorated double hexagons shown on the right - hand side of the figure .",
    "evidently the decorated tiles carry information fully equivalent to the arrowing .",
    "notice that proper matching of the edges of outer hexagons is equivalent to a * change * of color as the short diagonal passes through the common edge . also notice that if one holds the black stripe horizontally , then as one moves along a full blue diagonal from right to left , the diagonal passes through the black stripe from above to below .",
    "it is the other way around for red stripes .",
    "we use this observation to make the color determination of the short diagonals in fig .",
    "[ bighexlineup].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    if we begin with a legal double hexagon tiling then we know that we end up with two well - matched hexagonal tilings : one of large hexagons and one of small hexagons",
    ". since we are assuming non - singularity , the well - matching of the small hexagons leads to a collection of triangles on the plane  equilateral triangles created by the stripes on the small hexagons .",
    "each small hexagon has an inner part of some edge of a triangle across it and the corners of two other triangles , one on each side of that edge , so altogether each small hexagon is involved with three triangles .",
    "the very smallest triangles ( called level @xmath7 triangles ) are those composed by putting three corner markings together around a common vertex of three small hexagons .",
    "every stripe in a hexagon obviously belongs to a triangle larger than these smallest ones .",
    "indeed there are triangles of ever increasing sizes , without limit .",
    "it is this result that we will establish in the next section .",
    "let us continue with a non - singular legal double hexagon tiling @xmath8 , in which we have completed its small hexagons to a well - matched hexagonal tiling and then resolved everything into triangles by decorating each of the small hexagons .",

    "[ nestedtrianglescheme ] , where the smaller triangle is nested in the larger . in this section",
    "we will prove that except for the very smallest triangles ( the ones made from three corners ) every triangle has another one nested inside it .",
    "from this , we will see that every triangle has inside it a sequence of triangles nested within each other , diminishing in size to the smallest size triangles .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon by saying that all triangles are * nested within*.        there is more to this .",
    "let us stretch out , or expand , the triangles created by the decorations of the small hexagons ( inner hexagons and corner hexagons ) so that the corners meet the edges of the triangle surrounding them as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nestedtrianglescheme ] . in doing this",
    "each nested triangle produces three neighbors that fill out the whole triangle that it lies in .",
    "in fact there is a nesting that involves one triangle sitting inside another of exactly twice the linear size , so that the larger triangle is decomposed into four equal - sized equilateral triangles of which the nested triangle is one .",
    "the three triangles that emerge as neighbors of the nested one are called * corner triangles * ( not to be confused with the smallest triangles that we formed out of three corner markings ) .",
    "we will speak of the patterns of triangles ( expanded or not ) which are formed by the decorations of the small hexagons as * arrangements of triangles * and derive their nesting properties as we proceed . notice that without the implications derived from the decorations of the outer hexagons , it is possible to get an arrangement of triangles like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ trianglepatch-008 ] , which is visibly periodic .",
    "in all we shall see that triangles that are nested within appear on ever increasing scales , so there is a hierarchical structure .",
    "we shall call such an arrangement of triangles a * nested triangulation*.        when we refer to the sizes of triangles in one of arrangements of triangles , we will always refer to the side lengths of the stretched out versions .",
    "lengths are normalized so that the smallest triangles will be of side length equal to @xmath9 .",

    "the first is that the basic triangles in @xmath70 have side length @xmath3 , so factors of @xmath3 relate scales of @xmath37- and @xmath70-nested triangulations .",
    "the second is that the directions of the sides in all the @xmath37-nested triangulations ( at all scales ) are @xmath71 , which we are referring to as @xmath59-directions , and those for @xmath70-nested triangulations are @xmath72 , which we have called @xmath26-directions .",
    "these two sets of directions are interchanged by @xmath73 rotations .    in a legal double hexagon tiling",
    "the large hexagons share one third of the vertices of the small hexagons , and their centers form some coset @xmath74 of @xmath75 .",
    "this brings us to a second inverse sequence of groups based on @xmath76 and corresponding group @xmath77 which is related to @xmath57 as shown in the commutative diagram .",
    "all the mappings here are the natural homomorphisms that arise from factoring out larger subgroups .",
    "@xmath78    given the choice of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , there is a unique element @xmath81 where @xmath82 for each @xmath15 , which maps onto @xmath54 and has @xmath83 .",
    "this follows from the more general fact :    [ subgroupintersections ] for all @xmath84 , @xmath85    proof : dividing out common powers of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we are reduced to proving that @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , both of which are trivial to verify .",
    "so , given a non - singular legal double hexagon tiling , we arrive not only at an element @xmath88 but also an element @xmath89 .",
    "this element picks out one coset @xmath90 for each @xmath91 and so should determine a family @xmath92 of nested triangulations , just the same way as @xmath54 did . to guarantee that we really do have a non - singular @xmath70-nested triangulation , that is to avoid infinite lines",
    ", we have to make an assumption similar to the non - singularity assumption that we have already seen .",
    "this time the triangle edges are in @xmath26-directions , so we must assume that @xmath93 does not lie in @xmath94 for any @xmath95 .",
    "thus the joint conditions equivalent to non - singularity are that for all @xmath63 ,    * @xmath61 does not in @xmath62 for any @xmath60 ; * @xmath93 does not lie in @xmath94 for any @xmath95 .",
    "these are the same conditions as appeared in @xcite , though we did not use double hexagon tilings there .",
    "we will pursue the detailed study of the singular double hexagon tilings in another paper .",
    "returning to our discussion , the situation is this .",
    "we are given a generic double hexagon tiling whose small hexagons are centered on @xmath37 and whose large hexagons are centered on @xmath96 .",
    "we thus have two nested triangulations @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the first being determined by the markings on the small hexagon tiles and the second simply by the algebra of the commutative diagram .",
    "since the large hexagon tiles can be given their own stripe and corner markings based on their arrowing in just the same way as we did for the smaller hexagons , it is natural to ask whether or not this new nested triangulation based on @xmath99 is the one that these markings create . in fact",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "here is the argument . as a matter of nomenclature",
    ", we will use the same concept of * level * for the new triangulation @xmath98 as we did before .",
    "the smallest triangles are said to be of level @xmath7 with side lengths equal to @xmath100 , and subsequent sizes have levels @xmath101 of side lengths @xmath102 .",
    "take any edge @xmath103 of a level @xmath23 triangle @xmath104 from the triangulation @xmath98 and let @xmath105 be its midpoint .",
    "the two ends of @xmath103 have the form @xmath106 for @xmath26 in one of the w - directions of the lattice , see the red line segment in fig .",
    "[ rightbisectors ] .",
    "since both end points lie in @xmath107 , we see that @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath59 be in the a - direction at right - angles to @xmath26 and consider the two points @xmath110 .",
    "these are two points of a level @xmath23 triangle of @xmath97 and @xmath105 is its midpoint .    to see this explicitly we take the case where @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "then    @xmath113    this shows that @xmath114 see fig .",
    "[ rightbisectors ] .",
    "this proves :     and @xmath98 right - bisect each other . ]    [ rightbisectorthm ] at their midpoints , the edges of level @xmath23 triangles of @xmath98 both right - bisect and are right - bisected by edges of level @xmath23 of @xmath97 .",
    "these midpoints are centers of double hexagon tiles and , as in all double hexagon tiles , the stripes of the inner and outer hexagons are at right - angles .",
    "this applies to triangles of all levels @xmath115 . since by prop .",
    "[ centraledgeproperty ] every stripe of a small hexagon lies at the middle of some edge of some triangle , we conclude that the nested triangulation @xmath98 is directly related to the stripes on the large hexagon tiles , namely the path created by these stripes form the triangles of this triangulation .",
    "thus the triangular tiling produced by the outer hexagons is indeed the one produced by the nested triangulation of @xmath98 .",
    "[ bisectionproperty ] illustrates what is going on here and also shows that the edge shifting ( involved in truly nesting the triangles ) is also properly indicated by the outer hexagon tiles .",
    "are the ends of an edge @xmath103 of a triangle @xmath104 from the nesting determined by @xmath98 . at its midpoint @xmath105",
    "we see the edge @xmath116 of a triangle @xmath17 from @xmath97 .",
    "the black triangles all come from the triangulation of @xmath97 , the largest ones being of level @xmath2 .",
    "the edge @xmath103 is maximal , in the sense that it is not part of an edge of some larger triangle from @xmath98 .",
    "thus at its ends , the stripes of the large hexagons at @xmath4 and @xmath22 are in the directions of the other sides of @xmath104 .",
    "the inner hexagons along @xmath117 are centered at double hexagon centers and their stripes are all oriented in the same direction , namely perpendicular to the @xmath117 . at the left we have separated out the outer hexagons that overlay the small hexagons along @xmath117 . we see their matching arrows and how their stripes align to form the edge @xmath117 ( in green ) .",
    "the colors ( red / blue ) of the short diameters of these large hexagons are determined by ( or determine , whichever way one wants to put it ) the color rule that we see in fig .",
    "[ bighexlineup ] , though note that the stripe of the large hexagons is perpendicular to that of the small ones , so the right / left crossing rule is opposite !",
    "the fact that the stripe orientation changes at the end dictates that the edge @xmath117 is an interior edge of a larger triangle .",
    "the shift indicated by the orientation of the arrows matches this . ]    a direct consequence of prop .",
    "[ rightbisectorthm ] is that generic ( resp .",
    "singular ) @xmath70-nested triangulations give rise to generic ( resp .",
    "singular ) @xmath37-nested triangulations :    [ generic - to - generic ] let @xmath99 and let @xmath61 be its image in @xmath118 .",
    "then @xmath97 is generic if and only if @xmath98 is generic .",
    "[ generic - to - generic ]",
    "at this point it is rather clear that given any triangulation @xmath97 and any choice of one coset @xmath119 leading to @xmath98 ought to lead to a legal double hexagon tiling . here",
    "are the details .",
    "we will assume that both triangulations are non - singular .",
    "this guarantees that there are no infinite edges , we get proper triangulations , and they are nested .",
    "this nesting can be geometrically manifested by laterally shifting the edges as indicated by the nesting .",
    "the voronoi cells of the lattices ( nearest neighbor cells ) are hexagons centered respectively on the points of @xmath97 and @xmath98 . we know that every hexagon from @xmath97 has a triangle edge passing through it and this edge",
    "will be shifted laterally in nesting .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ nestedtrianglesandhexagons ] .",
    "the hexagon is made into a well - arrowed hexagon by placing the pair of parallel arrows in the direction of the shift .",
    "the small hexagons now make a well - arrowed and well - matched hexagon tiling .",

    "[ nestedtrianglesandhexagons - ii ] .",
    "this is the second well - arrowed and well - matched hexagonal tiling .",

    "the nesting of the triangulation @xmath97 arising from @xmath61 is indicated . ]    , from @xmath121 we obtain a nested triangulation @xmath98 , part of which is shown here . ]",
    "by definition a penrose tiling is precisely a legal double hexagon tiling .",
    "taylor - socolar tilings ( t - s tilings ) are usually defined by the t - s tiles shown in fig .",
    "[ basic - t - stiles ]        and they are assembled as regular hexagonal tilings , but under the matching rules    * the black lines must join continuously when tiles abut ; * the ends of the diameters of two hexagonal tiles that are separated by an edge of another tile must be of opposite colors .    in fig .",
    "[ bighexlineup ] we have seen that the diagonals of the inner hexagons of a double hexagon tiling can be colored , and if we restrict this coloring to the actual physical area of the inner hexagons then we have the colorings of fig .",
    "[ basic - t - stiles ] .",
    "the matching of the outer arrows of the double hexagon tiling amounts to the color rule * rt2 * , so we have in this way one third of a t - s tiling . if the double hexagon tiling is legal then we know that this partial hexagonal tiling of inner hexagons along with the corner hexagons completes to a new properly arrowed hexagonal tiling together with a corresponding nested triangulation .",
    "if we assume that the nested triangulation is non - singular , which is generically the case , then this tiling - triangulation corresponds to a unique t - s tiling .",
    "that is , the one - third tiling we have completes uniquely to a t - s tiling .",
    "the proof of this is given in @xcite  each non - singular nested triangulation corresponds to a unique t - s tiling and vice - versa .",
    "thus every non - singular penrose tiling produces inside it a non - singular t - s tiling made out of its inner and corner hexagons .",
    "now let us go in the other direction .",
    "if we begin with a non - singular t - s tiling then it produces a nested triangulation out of the stripes on each hexagon .",
    "relative to a fixed coordinate system , this triangulation corresponds to an element @xmath122 in the @xmath37-adic completion @xmath118 . in order to obtain a double hexagon tiling from this",
    "we need to select which hexagons will be the inner hexagons and which the corner hexagons for the new tiling",
    ". this amounts to choosing one coset from the @xmath123 .",
    "choose one , say , @xmath119 .",
    "then there is a unique @xmath99 that maps @xmath61 under the natural mapping of @xmath77 to @xmath118 and for which @xmath83 .",
    "this produces the centers and the nested triangulation that determines a legal double hexagon tiling , as we have pointed out in ",
    "[ nt2dht ] .    to reiterate , we see that the nested triangulation of the large hexagon tiles determines the nested triangulation of the inner hexagonal tiles .",
    "thus , although we only see the coloring of one third of an underlying t - s tiling , the entire nesting of the triangulation arising from the small hexagon tiles is implicitly known from the nested triangulation of the larger hexagon tiles : we know @xmath61 once we know @xmath93 .",
    "a noteworthy observation comes by comparing fig .",
    "[ basic - t - stiles ] and fig .",
    "[ newdeco - on - penrosetile ] : it shows that the distinction between the parity ( that is , the difference between the two types of small hexagon tiles ( respectively large hexagon tiles ) is the same for the t - s tiling and the penrose tiling .",
    "thus the parity distribution of a penrose tiling is the same as the parity distribution of one coset modulo @xmath70 of the t - s tiles .",
    "although it is shown in @xcite that the two tiling spaces generated by t - s tilings and penrose tilings define distinct mld ( mutual local derivabillity ) classes , it is clear by now that the two types of tilings are intimately related , and indeed , modulo the choice of a coset , there is a mutual derivability .",
    "we can summarize some key points as follows :    * taylor - socolar tilings and penrose tilings are aperiodic .",
    "* given a non - singular taylor - socolar tiling on @xmath37 , one can build , in a canonical way , three different non - singular penrose tilings , one for each of the three cosets @xmath119 of @xmath124 . at any point of @xmath119 one",
    "knows exactly what type of penrose tile should be put in that position , and this uses only local information of the t - s tiling . *",
    "given a non - singular penrose tiling on some coset @xmath74 , there is a unique nested triangulation on @xmath37 formed by the decoration of inner hexagons and corner hexagons of penrose tiles .",
    "this nested triangulation gives a unique non - singular t - s tiling .",
    "note that unlike the situation in ( ii ) , this construction , is not local .",
    "the process of producing double hexagon tiles from a pair @xmath125 , @xmath126 suggests that we might do it again , choosing a coset @xmath127 with @xmath128 and then determining @xmath129 .",
    "this triple @xmath130 leads to triple - hexagon tiles and a triple - hexagon tiling .",
    "the rules for admissibility follow the same principles as we have used above .",
    "the largest hexagonal tiles have middle sized hexagonal tiles at their centers , and create middle sized corner tiles around them .",

    "this yields a well - arrowed hexagonal tiling of middle sized tiles . in the same way ,",
    "create from this a hexagonal tiling of small tiles , and where again we require well - arrowing throughout .",
