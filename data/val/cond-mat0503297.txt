    "much theoretical and experimental work has been devoted to the investigation of films of highly quantal fluids ( e.g. , condensed helium ) adsorbed on a variety of substrates , from the most strongly attractive , such as graphite , to relatively weak ones , such as alkali metals @xcite .",
    "the motivation underlying this effort is the understanding of the fascinating properties that quantum films display , often quite different than those of bulk materials .",
    "thin films of _ para_-hydrogen ( 2 ) are of considerable interest .",
    "one of the reasons is that a fluid of _ p_-h@xmath2 molecules is regarded as a potential  second superfluid \" , due to the light mass and the bosonic character of its constituents @xcite . in bulk _",
    "p_-h@xmath2 , superfluidity is not observed , because , unlike helium , h@xmath2 solidifies at a temperature ( @xmath3 @xmath1 13 k ) significantly higher than that ( @xmath4 4 k ) at which phenomena such as bose condensation and , possibly , superfluidity ( sf ) might occur .",
    "this is due the depth of the attractive well of the potential between two hydrogen molecules , significantly greater than that between two helium atoms .",
    "several , attempts have been made @xcite to supercool bulk liquid 2 , but the search for sf ( in the bulk ) has so far not met with success .",
    "confinement , and reduction of dimensionality , are widely regarded as plausible avenues to the stabilization of a liquid phase of 2 at temperatures sufficiently low that a sf transition may be observed .",
    "indeed , computer simulations yielded evidence of superfluid behavior in very small ( less than 20 molecules ) _",
    "p_-h@xmath2 clusters@xcite , and claims have been made of its actual experimental observation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , sf has also been predicted to occur in a strictly two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ p_-h@xmath2 fluid embedded in a crystalline matrix of potassium atoms @xcite .",
    "interesting as the above predictions undoubtedly are , they pertain to physical systems that are not easily realized in a laboratory , nor are controlled measurements of their properties always practical . on the other hand , adsorbed films of 2 are readily accessible experimentally , and in fact have been extensively investigated , on different substrates . for example , the phase diagram and structure of monolayer 2 films adsorbed on graphite have been studied by various techniques @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects @xcite is that the melting temperature @xmath5 of a solid 2 monolayer can be significantly less than bulk 2 .",
    "the question arises of whether a considerable reduction of @xmath5 could be achieved on a weak substrate , such as that of a alkali metal .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that , for a @xmath6he monolayer adsorbed on lithium , zero - point motion in the direction perpendicular to the substrate is quite significant , accounting for a doubling of the kinetic energy per atom , with respect to strictly 2d 4 .",
    "such zero - point motion , conceivably important in a 2 film as well , could result in an effective screening of the interaction of 2 molecules , leading to a suppression of the melting temperature , perhaps to the point where novel quantum many - body phenomena may become observable in the liquid phase .    in this work , attention is directed to the physics of 2 films adsorbed on alkali metals substrates . besides the issue of sf",
    ", this system has elicited interest among condensed matter scientists for its intriguing wetting properties .",
    "it was suggested @xcite , and experimentally verified @xcite , that h@xmath2 , like 4 , ought not wet cesium ( cs ) or rubidium ( rb ) substrates at low temperature , due to the relatively shallow depth of the substrate - adatom potential .",
    "it is not known whether a thermodynamically stable 2 film should exist , at low @xmath3 , on _ any _ of the other alkali substrates , namely potassium ( k ) , sodium ( na ) or lithium ( li ) .",
    "particularly intriguing is the question of the existence of a 2 monolayer on these substrates , and what its melting temperature @xmath5 should be .    aside from the study of the phase diagram of 2d 2 by gordillo and ceperley @xcite , and of a 2 surface by wagner and ceperley @xcite , theoretical calculations for realistic models of adsorbed 2",
    "films have focused on graphite@xcite .",
    "only recently have the first theoretical studies of 2 films on alkali substrates been carried out , based on path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations @xcite as well as on semi - empirical density functional methods @xcite .",
    "pimc studies have shown evidence of a wetting transition for liquid 2 on rb and cs at temperatures well above 20 k.    here , we present detailed pimc results for a model of 2 film adsorbed on li and na substrates , in the temperature range between 2 and 13 k , i.e. , significantly lower than that studied in ref . .",
    "the most accurate potentials currently available are utilized to describe the interactions among 2 molecules , as well as between the molecules and the substrates , which are regarded as smooth ( i.e. , corrugation is neglected ) .",
    "the main results of this study are the following :    1 .",
    "no stable 2 film forms on a na substrate , in the @xmath7 limit ; the same is expected to hold true _ a fortiori _ on a k substrate , which is more weakly attractive than na .",
    "2 .   adsorption on a li substrate occurs through completion of successive solid layers . a stable solid 2 monolayer exists , whose equilibrium coverage ( i.e. , 2d density ) is @xmath8 2 .",
    "this is the same value ( within statistical uncertainty ) found on graphite @xcite , only slightly greater than the theoretically computed equilibrium density of 2d 2 ( see ref . ) .",
    "the spread of a 2 monolayer in the direction perpendicular to the substrate is significantly less than for a 4 monolayer , and its melting temperature is @xmath4 6.5 k , i.e. , very close to what has been theoretically predicted@xcite for 2d 2 .",
    "the quantitative similarity of the results obtained in this work to those involving different substrates , of greatly varying strength and corrugation , suggests that the basic physics of this system is driven by the interaction among hydrogen molecules , and that the role of the substrate is rather marginal .",
    "although the pimc method utilized in this work allows for the sampling of permutations of particles , which is essential in order to reproduce in the simulation any effect due to quantum statistics , permutations are not seen to occur , in the temperature range explored .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion reached in previous work by others @xcite . in the crystal phase ,",
    "permutations are suppressed ( as in most solids ) by the localization of 2 molecules ; at higher temperature , on the other hand , though the crystal melts and molecules are less localized , they also behave more classically , as their thermal wave length decreases . consistently with permutations not being important , i.e. 2 molecules obeying boltzmann statistics in the temperature range explored here , no evidence of sf can be seen @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows : in the next section , the model hamiltonian is introduced , and a brief description is provided of the most important aspects of the computational method utilized ( pimc ) , of which comprehensive reviews exist in the literature ; we then illustrate our results and outline our conclusions .",
    "consistently with other theoretical studies , our system of interest is modeled as an ensemble of @xmath9 2 molecules , regarded as point particles , moving in the presence of an infinite , smooth planar substrate ( positioned at @xmath10 ) .",
    "the quantum - mechanical many - body hamiltonian is the following : @xmath11 the system is enclosed in a vessel shaped as a parallelepid , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the 2 molecular mass , @xmath13 is the potential describing the interaction between two 2 molecules , only depending on their relative distance , whereas @xmath14 is the potential describing the interaction of a helium atom with the substrate , also depending only on the distance of the atom from the substrate .",
    "the silvera - goldman potential@xcite was chosen to model the interaction between two 2 molecules ; this potential has been shown to provide an acceptable quantitative description of bulk 2 in the condensed phase@xcite .    the following potential , proposed by chizmeshya , cole , and zaremba@xcite was adopted to describe the interaction of a 2 molecule with a smooth substrate ( i.e. , the @xmath14 term in ( [ one ] ) ) @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the first term in ( [ ccz ] )",
    "represents the pauli repulsion between the electronic cloud of the molecules and the surface electrons , whereas the second term expresses the van der waals attraction .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 used here are the ones supplied in ref . .",
    "the above model is , clearly , highly simplified . by far the most important simplification",
    "consists of the neglect of substrate corrugation , whose role is significant for attractive substrates such as graphite @xcite , but can be expected to be less important on substrates such as those of alkali metals , which are relatively weak .",
    "the path integral monte carlo method is a numerical ( quantum monte carlo ) technique that allows one to obtain accurate estimates of physical averages for quantum many - body systems at finite temperature .",
    "the only input of a pimc calculation is the many - body hamiltonian ( [ one ] ) ( which includes the potential energy functions @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "pimc yields results that are affected only by a ( small ) statistical uncertainty , as well as by an error due to the finite size of a many - particle system that can be practically simulated on a computer .",
    "computing facilities commonly available nowadays comfortably afford pimc computations for systems of several hundred particles ; this size is normally sufficient to obtain fairly accurate estimates of energetics and most structural properties of interest .",
    "pimc simulations have been extensively adopted to study physisorption of helium on a variety of substrates , including alkali metals@xcite .",
    "because thorough descriptions of the pimc method can be found in the literature @xcite , it will not be reviewed here .",
    "we only provide some relevant details , namely :    1 .",
    "we have experimented in this work with a high - temperature approximation for the many - body density matrix @xmath22 which is accurate up to order @xmath23 ( see , for instance , ref . ) .",
    "this form is not as effective as the pair - product approximation ( ppa ) , more commonly used in pimc simulations @xcite of highly quantal fluids , such as helium .",
    "we have empirically observed convergence of the energy estimates with a time step @xmath24 k@xmath25 , almost a three times shorter than in comparable pimc studies based on the ppa @xcite .",
    "the use of the high - temperature density matrix considered here simplifies ( in our view ) the calculation , without rendering it unacceptably inefficient computationally .",
    "accurate estimates for quantities other than the energy , such as film density profiles , can be usually obtained with twice as large a time step .",
    "a multi - level metropolis scheme based on the staging algorithm @xcite with free - particle sampling was used to sample many - particle paths through configuration space .",
    "this technique has been shown to be an effective remedy to the inefficiency of single - slice sampling , at low temperature .",
    "we adjusted the length @xmath26 of the portion of individual single - particle paths that the algorithm attempts to update , so that the acceptance rate remain above 20% . typically , @xmath27 0.025 k@xmath25 .",
    "rigid displacements of single particle paths were performed as well .",
    "the average displacement was chosen to ensure an acceptance rate of approximately 50% .",
    "we have included in our calculation the sampling of cyclic permutations of groups of 2 molecules , based on an algorithm very similar to that illustrated in ref . .",
    "this procedure is not restricted to sampling groups of 2 , 3 or 4 molecules , but allows in principle cycles of arbitrary lengths ( up to @xmath9 ) to be constructed . as mentioned in the introduction , however , we found , at the physical conditions explored in this work permutations occur exceedingly rarely .",
    "this could be the result of using less than optimal a sampling algorithm , but we have verified that our procedure is capable of sampling permutations , with reasonable efficiency , for bulk @xmath6he ( a simulated system of 64 atoms ) at t=2 k and saturated vapor pressure .",
    "thus , we believe the absence of permutations in our simulation to reflect a physical effect , in agreement with what observed by other authors @xcite .",
    "physical quantities of interest , besides the kinetic , potential and total ( @xmath28 ) energy per molecule , are the 2 density profiles as a function of the distance @xmath29 from the substrate , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the area of the substrate and @xmath32 is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) 2 density , as well as the the angularly averaged ,  reduced \" pair correlation function @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the coverage and with @xmath37 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath33 provides a quantitative assessment of the two - dimensional character of an adsorbed film ; the more two - dimensional an adsorbed film , the more closely @xmath33 mimics the pair correlation function of a strictly two - dimensional system of the same coverage .    as for the typical size of the physical systems simulated in this work , for @xmath38 @xmath39 ,",
    "pimc calculations were carried out on a system of 36 2 molecules , initially arranged on a triangular lattice at a distance of 3   from the substrate . at higher coverage",
    ", the initial arrangement was taken to be a series of successive solid ( triangular ) layers , arranged as in a hexagonal close - packed lattice , each layer of 2d density @xmath40 and with an incomplete top layer .",
    "films of up to three layers are studied . at the monolayer equilibrium coverage @xmath41 @xmath39",
    ", we also obtained results for a system of 144 particles .",
    "no noticeable dependence of the estimates on the size of the system can be observed for the physical quantities discussed here , with the exception of the energy . in all calculations ,",
    "the height of the simulation box ( i.e. the distance between the periodically replicated images of the substrate ) is 30  , i.e. , much greater than the maximum film thickness observed , so as to make the use of periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath29 direction ( perpendicular to the substrate ) uninfluent .",
    "pimc results were obtained in whis work for two substrates , namely na and li .",
    "let us begin with an assessment of the energetics of the 2 films on the two substrates .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows computed values of the energy per 2 molecule @xmath42 , as a function of coverage , on a li and on a na substrate , at a temperature @xmath3=2 k. these numbers can be very reliably regarded as ground state estimates , as values of the energy computed below @xmath43 5 k are found to be temperature - independent , within the statistical uncertainties of the calculation . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents the ground state energy per molecule ( @xmath44 k ) of bulk 2 , in the fcc crystal structure , as computed by silvera and goldman @xcite using self - consistent phonon theory @xcite .",
    "the two curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] share some qualitative features , e , g .",
    ", a succession of well - defined , equally spaced local minima , corresponding to adlayer completion .",
    "these minima occur at the same values of @xmath45 on both substrates , suggesting that the main player in the energy balance is the interaction potential among 2 molecules .",
    "let us consider the case of na first .",
    "although it is ( almost monotonically ) decreasing , the @xmath42 curve on na appears to be flattening off , approaching the value @xmath46 from above , asymptotically .",
    "this indicates that no film of any thickness will form , i.e. , that 2 will not wet na , at low @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , this conclusion can only be made tentatively , based on the results obtained up to a value of the coverage @xmath47 @xmath39 .",
    "it is possible that a stable ( thick ) film may exist . on performing pimc calculation on systems twice the size of that considered here",
    ", one could establish more robustly the trend observed here ; however , even in that case one would need to supplement the information provided by pimc with some other calculation ( perhaps df ) , capable ( at least in principle ) of making predictions in the @xmath48 limit .    assuming",
    "that on na one indeed has a non - wetting situation , one question that arises is that of the temperature associated to the wetting transition ; this issue was not addressed in this work .",
    "on li , on the other hand , the @xmath42 curve is monotonically decreasing for @xmath49 , with @xmath50 @xmath39 ; it attains a minimum at @xmath0 , with @xmath51 k , i.e. below @xmath46 , and displays a slowly increasing trend ( while going through well - defined local minima , as mentioned above ) for greater values of @xmath45 .",
    "it seems physically reasonable to expect that @xmath42 should also flatten off , and approach @xmath46 from below , in the @xmath48 limit , though , again , the finite size limitation of this calculation do not allow us to make this conclusion firmly .",
    "the local minima of @xmath42 correspond to successive solid layers ( more about this later in the manuscript ) ; between these minima , films are thermodynamically unstable .",
    "this situation is physically quite different from the case of a @xmath6he film on the same substrate , for which continuous growth of film thickness as a function of chemical potential is observed , with no layering @xcite .      in the remainder of this manuscript",
    ", we shall concentrate on the substrate on which thermodynamically stable 2 films are seen to form , i.e. , li . completion of the first layer occurs at a coverage @xmath52 .",
    "this value is consistent with that found on graphite@xcite , even though a graphite substrate is over four times more attractive , and corrugation plays a significant role .",
    "it is also only slightly above the equilibrium density @xcite of pure 2d 2 .",
    "this suggests that , as long as the substrate is sufficiently strong to stabilize a film , the basic physics of an adsorbed 2 monolayer film is largely substrate - independent , driven primarily by the interaction potential between 2 molecules .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows an instantaneous  snapshot \" of a many - particle configuration for an adsorbed film at the equilibrium density ( top view ) . each fuzzy ",
    "cloud \" represents a single molecule ; the characteristic size of a cloud gives a quantitative measure of the effect of zero point motion .",
    "the arrangement of all molecules on a triangular lattice is fairly clear . also apparent",
    "is the lack of any substantial overlap between different clouds , to indicate that permutations of particles are unimportant in this system .",
    "more quantitative structural information is furnished by the density correlation function @xmath33 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ spat ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "the computed @xmath33 at @xmath53 is found to be virtually indistinguishable from the pair correlation function in strictly two - dimensional 2 , at the same coverage ( and at @xmath3=0 ) @xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the 2 density profile in the direction ( @xmath29 ) perpendicular to the substrate ( solid line ) .",
    "also shown , for comparison , is the corresponding density profile for a monolayer @xmath6he film adsorbed on the same substrate , at @xmath3=0 ( from ref . ) .",
    "the 2 film rests in closer proximity to the substrate ( by approximately 1.5  ) with respect to the helium one , and has about half the width .",
    "thus , the physics of a 2 monolayer is even more 2d than that of one of he .",
    "moreover , the kinetic energy per 2 molecule at this coverage , in the @xmath7 limit is worth approximately 40 k , i.e. , @xmath4 30% more than in a purely 2d 2 system at the same coverage @xcite ; this should be compared to the factor two difference in kinetic energy between 2d 4 and an adsorbed 4 film on li ( from ref . ) .    in spite of their lighter mass ,",
    "2 molecules experience a lesser degree of zero - point delocalization in the perpendicular direction , because of the much stronger attraction to the substrate@xcite , as well as to the other molecules .",
    "as more layers are adsorbed on the substrate , zero point molecular motion in the perpendicular direction is suppressed even further in the underlying layers , which become more compressed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .      in order to study the melting of a solid 2 monolayer at the determined equilibrium coverage ( namely @xmath54 2 ) , we computed the energy per molecule of the system as a function of temperature ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "melting corresponds to a peak in the specific heat @xmath56 .",
    "the specific heat can show several such  anomalies \" , corresponding to different transitions ( e.g. , solid to solid - vapour coexistence ) ; several peaks are indeed observed in numerical simulations on graphite , for a commensurate solid layer with vacancies @xcite . in order to reduce the smearing of the peaks , which inevitably occurs when one is performing a numerical study on a system of finite size",
    ", we increased the number of particles from 36 to 144 in this calculation , corresponding to a simulation cell in which the area of the substrate @xmath31 equals 48.74   @xmath57 41.21   .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and summarized in table [ table ] .",
    "the energy estimates are not corrected for the long - range tail of the interaction potential between 2 molecules , which is truncated at 21    in the simulation ( potential truncation is routinely done when studying finite systems with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "we estimate the correction on the total energy to be worth no more than 0.03 k.    the results of table [ table ] show that the dependence of the total energy per molecule on the temperature reflects essentially that of the potential energy alone , as the kinetic energy depends weakly on temperature , for this adsorbed monolayer film .",
    "the determination of values for the specific heat from the energy estimates can be made by numerical differentiation , but it is difficult to obtain accurate results in this way . moreover , our primary objective was to locate the occurrence of the phase transition , and the figure clearly suggests a melting temperature @xmath58 6.5 k , which is where the computed @xmath55 curve displays a sudden , abrupt change of slope .",
    ".kinetic , potential and total energy per 2 molecule ( in k ) on a li substrate , computed by pimc at a coverage @xmath54 2 at different temperatures .",
    "results are for a 144-particle system",
    ". statistical errors ( in parentheses ) are on the last digit(s ) .",
    "these estimates are not corrected for the long - range tail of the interaction potential between 2 molecules , which is cut off at 21  .",
    "we estimate the correction on the total energy to be worth no more than 0.03 k [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these results are similar to those obtained by wagner and ceperley , who studied the melting of a 2 surface @xcite .",
    "the computed melting temperature is also quite close to the theoretical 2d result @xcite .",
    "this suggests that this system may provide a rather close experimental realization of a 2d system , in many respects even more so than an adsorbed helium film .",
    "the problem of melting of a 2d solid is interesting and , to a considerable degree , still open . in particular , the transition from a solid to a liquid phase",
    "can be either discontinuous or continuous , the system going , in the latter case , through an intermediate , ",
    "hexatic \" phase featuring local six - fold , bond - angle order @xcite .",
    "such a hexatic hase can then melt into a disordered fluid as a result of unbinding of dislocations @xcite .",
    "the results of this study point to a 2 monolayer adsorbed on a li substrate as a candidate to observe such a scenario experimentally .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "on the other hand , unambiguous confirmation of dislocation - mediated melting is complicated by the finite size of the system that can be studied in practice @xcite .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows density profiles computed at three different temperatures , below , above , and close to the melting temperature .",
    "they clearly suggest that melting occurs concurrently with second layer promotion ; one can therefore opine that melting occurs microscopically with the formation of vacancies in the bottom layer .",
    "visual inspection of instantaneous many - particle configurations ( an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , for a temperature @xmath3=8 k ) at temperatures just above @xmath59 indeed seems to indicate the presence of vacancies ( and dislocations ) in the bottom layer .",
    "adsorption of 2 on alkali metals substrates was studied theoretically by means of path integral monte carlo simulations . in order to assess the expected relevance of the results presented here to experiments , one clearly needs to assess quantitatively",
    "the limitations of the model utilized , as well those of the calculation .",
    "the potential used here to describe the interaction between two 2 molecules , namely the silvera - goldman potential , is the one for which most of the previous monte carlo simulations have been carried out .",
    "it is known to be reasonably accurate , even though a comprehensive , quantitative assessment is , to our knowledge , still lacking .",
    "its main limitation is that of being merely a two - body potential .",
    "although it is designed to incorporate , at least in part , effects of three - body interactions , this is done only in an effective way .",
    "nonetheless , it seems unlikely ( to us ) that the use of a more refined version of the interaction would significantly , qualitatively change the results .",
    "more important seems the uncertainty of the substrate - adatom potential .",
    "the potentials used in this calculation are the most current , and are a significant improvement over the early  3 - 9 \" potential , both with respect to the functional form as well as the value of the most important parameters ( e.g. , the well depth ) .",
    "however , their absolute accuracy has not yet been quantitatively assessed ; to that aim , additional experimental input may be needed .",
    "we computed energetics for adsorbed films on both li and na substrates ; results show that thermodynamically stable adsorbed 2 films will form on li , whereas a na substrate ( and therefore all other alkali metals substrates , which are even weaker than na ) is too weakly attractive for a stable film to form .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental observation of a wetting transition on cs and rb @xcite .",
    "such a transition is predicted to occur on na and k substrates as well , most likely at a temperature above the critical temperature , as observed on rb .",
    "we also investigated thermodynamic properties of a 2 monolayer on a li substrate .",
    "this system has an equilibrium coverage at low temperature essentially identical to that on graphite , approximately 0.070 2 , and is considerably more two - dimensional that a 4 monolayer adsorbed on the same ( li ) substrate , owing to the much stronger attraction to the substrate experienced by a 2 molecule with respect to a 4 atom .",
    "we determined the melting temperature of the monolayer to be approximately 6.5 k , which is very close to theoretically computed 2d value . while this value is considerably lower than the 3d one ( @xmath4 13 k ) , it is still much higher than the temperature at which quantum exchanges are expected@xcite to become significant ( @xmath4 1 k ) . as exchanges , and long cycles of particle permutations",
    "are known to be crucial to the onset of superfluidity @xcite , this system does not appear to offer a promising avenue for the observation of a sf transition in 2 . because a li substrate is observed to be relatively strong , whereas a na one is already too weak to allow adsorption",
    ", one might wonder whether a substrate made of an alloy of li and na ( or , li and another alkali metal ) might have intermediate properties , possibly leading to enhanced zero point motion in the perpendicular direction and increased quantum character .",
    "theoretical investigation of adsorption on such a  hybrid \" substrate is under way .",
    "more generally , however , observing novel phases of molecular 2 may require achieving a substantial renormalization of the interaction of 2 molecules , possibly through their interaction with the surface electrons of a metal substrate , or of a nanostructure .",
