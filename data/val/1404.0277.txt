    "there are numerous tasks in quantum information theory which involve the use of quantum channels .",
    "a quantum channel has many different capacities , depending on the task at hand , the nature of the information transmitted , and available resources .",
    "for example , the quantum capacity of a channel quantifies its potential for communication of quantum information , whereas its private capacity quantifies its potential for secure communication of classical information  @xcite . deciding whether a given quantum channel has a positive capacity is a non - trivial problem , e.g. there does not exist a unique criterion to determine whether the quantum capacity of a given channel is zero .",
    "classical channels with zero capacity are uninteresting in the information - theoretic sense .",
    "in contrast , quantum channels with zero capacity exhibit intriguing behavior as shown by the superactivation phenomenon  @xcite : there exist examples of pairs of channels with zero quantum capacity , which , when used in tandem , allow transmission of quantum information .",
    "one particular class of zero - capacity channels consists of _ antidegradable channels_. for such a channel , a post - processing of its environment can simulate the output of the channel  @xcite .",
    "the no - cloning theorem  @xcite ensures that such channels have zero quantum capacity .",
    "the simplest example of the latter is a 50% erasure channel which with equal probability either transmits the input state perfectly or replaces it with an erasure flag .",
    "however , there are other non - trivial examples of channels with zero quantum capacity , e.g. ,  the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) channels  @xcite . in addition , antidegradable channels also have zero private capacity ( unlike ppt channels ) , but whether they are the only non - trivial quantum channels with this property is an open question ( since there exist echo - correctable channels with arbitrarily small , but non - zero , private capacity  @xcite ) . therefore , the knowledge that a given channel has zero quantum and private capacity is not sufficient to conclude that it is antidegradable .",
    "this leads us to the following question :    ( q ) : is there a setting in which one can obtain a complete operational characterization of antidegradable channels ?    in this paper",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative by constructing a game - theoretic framework which involves the noisy quantum channel @xmath0 ( which we wish to characterize ) , a quantum public side channel @xmath1 , and three parties : alice ( the sender ) , bob ( the receiver ) and eve ( the eavesdropper ) .",
    "alice sends classical information to bob through @xmath0 , whose environment is accessible to eve .",
    "alice also sends information through @xmath1 , which is accessible to both bob and eve .",
    "the game is constructed as follows ( formal definitions are given in section  [ sec : main ] ) .",
    "alice chooses a letter @xmath2 at random from a given finite alphabet @xmath3 , and encodes it in a bipartite state , say @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 part of the input is sent through @xmath6 , while the @xmath7 part is transmitted via @xmath8 .",
    "bob then obtains the output of @xmath9 while eve receives the information that is transmitted to the channel s environment . in other words , she receives the output of the _ complementary channel _",
    "@xmath10 ( see section 2 for its definition ) .",
    "in addition , they both receive the output of @xmath8 .",
    "the task now , for both bob and eve , is to guess which letter @xmath2 alice chose .",
    "since bob and eve are competing , they both adopt the optimal guessing strategy they have available .",
    "correspondingly , the reliabilities of their guesses is measured by the optimal guessing probabilities of the ensembles of states they receive .",
    "bob wins the game whenever his guessing probability is _ strictly higher _ than that of eve ( i.e. in the case of a draw , eve wins ) .",
    "the situation is depicted in figure  [ fig:1 ] below .",
    "( i.e. the one which we want to characterize ) and a quantum channel @xmath11 , which is public , in the sense that it conveys the same output to bob and eve .",
    "a natural example of such a public channel is a symmetric channel  @xcite .",
    "bob plays the guessing game against eve , who has access to the environment of @xmath9 ( labelled by @xmath10 ) and @xmath11.,width=302 ]    to state our main result ( theorem  [ theo : main ] ) which leads to the characterization of antidegradable channels , we first introduce the notion of _ extension _ of a quantum channel : for any pair of quantum channels @xmath12 we say that @xmath13 is an _ extension _ of @xmath14 if @xmath15 for some quantum channel @xmath16 .",
    "this is a generalization of the notion of _ degradable extension _ of the channel ( introduced in  @xcite ) which corresponds to the case in which the channel @xmath13 is degradable and @xmath14 is complementary to it .",
    "then our result can be stated as follows : for any given input ensemble of states , the guessing probability of the output ensemble of @xmath17 is higher than that of @xmath18 , if and only if @xmath17 is an extension of @xmath18 .",
    "we establish the above result by first proving its analogue for statistical comparison of bipartite states and then using choi isomorphism .",
    "consider the case in which @xmath14 is the quantum channel @xmath19 employed in the guessing game  [ game ] , and @xmath13 is the channel @xmath10 which is complementary to it .",
    "for this choice , our result ( theorem  [ theo : main ] ) implies that @xmath19 is antidegradable _ if and only if _ eve always wins , regardless of the choice of alice s encoding strategy . in other words",
    ", our result shows that , _ for any _ channel which is not antidegradable , there exists ( at least ) one encoding strategy which alice can choose to make bob win the guessing game .",
    "we note that even though the scenario of our guessing game is ` cryptographic ' in its nature ( since bob and eve compete ) , proving that bob is able to win against eve in the guessing game is insufficient to conclude that any _ information - theoretic secrecy _ can be established between alice and bob .",
    "this is because , in the guessing game , we only compare the guessing probabilities of bob and eve , and not the mutual informations between the random variables corresponding to their respective inferences and that of the random variable corresponding to alice s input . however , the game - theoretic scenario  [ game ] has the particular advantage of singling out antidegradable channels as the only channels for which eve necessarily wins .",
    "in other words , a _ necessary and sufficient condition _ for the quantum channel @xmath9 to be antidegradable is that eve wins the guessing game , for any possible encoding strategy alice may choose .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : main ] we introduce the necessary notation and definitions , and then state our main result ( theorem  [ theo : main ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : states ] we derive an analogue of theorem  [ theo : main ] for partial orderings of bipartite quantum states . in section",
    "[ sec : back - to - channels ] we use this result , in conjunction with the choi isomorphism , to obtain a proof of theorem  [ theo : main ]",
    ". some further implications of theorem  [ theo : main ] for convex combinations of channels and their extensions are given in [ sec : further ] .",
    "we end with a brief summary and open questions in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in what follows , we only consider quantum systems defined on finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath20 .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the set of all linear operators acting on @xmath20 , and by @xmath22 the set of all density operators ( or _ states _ ) @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25=1 $ ] .",
    "the identity operator in @xmath21 will be denoted by the symbol @xmath26 , whereas the identity map from @xmath21 to itself will be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "a _ positive - operator valued measure _ ( povm ) is a family @xmath28 of operators @xmath29 , labelled by a finite index set @xmath30 ( i.e. the _ outcome set _ ) , such that @xmath31 .    in what follows ,",
    "a _ channel _ is considered as a triple @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the input hilbert space , @xmath34 is the output hilbert space , and @xmath35 is a completely positive , trace - preserving ( cptp ) linear map . where possible , we will denote a channel @xmath32 simply as @xmath9 .",
    "the adjoint ( heisenberg dual ) of a linear map @xmath36 is the linear map @xmath37 defined with respect to the hilbert - schmidt inner product by @xmath38:=\\tr[x\\ \\mn(y)]$ ] , for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath9 is a channel , its adjoint @xmath41 is a completely positive , unital ( unit - preserving ) , i.e. @xmath42 , linear map ( and vice versa ) .    given a channel @xmath32 , its _ stinespring isometric dilation _",
    "@xcite is given by a complementary ( ancillary ) quantum system @xmath43 ( the ` environment ' ) together with an isometry @xmath44 , @xmath45 , such that @xmath46,\\quad\\forall x\\in\\bound(\\sh_a).\\ ] ] the stinespring isometric dilation , which always exists , can be considered to be essentially unique , in the sense that it is unique up to isometric equivalences on @xmath43 .",
    "this leads us to define an essentially unique complementary channel @xmath47 as follows  @xcite : @xmath48.\\ ] ]    given a channel @xmath32 , let @xmath47 be its complementary channel .",
    "@xmath9 is called _ antidegradable _ if and only if there exists another channel @xmath49 such that @xmath50 ( it is easy to verify that the property of being antidegradable does not depend on the particular stinespring isometric dilation chosen to construct the complementary channel . ) [ def : degradable ]    in other words , an eavesdropper , eve , who has access to the environment of an antidegradable channel , can perfectly simulate the output of the channel by means of a fixed post - processing which is independent of the input . in this sense ,",
    "eve always receives _ more information _ than the receiver bob . as a straightforward consequence ,",
    "antidegradable channels turn out to have zero capacity for any information - theoretic protocol that aims to put bob in a position of advantage over eavesdropper .",
    "another notion we need is the following  @xcite :    [ def : symmetric ] for a given finite integer @xmath51 , let @xmath33 be a @xmath52-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath34 and @xmath43 be @xmath53-dimensional hilbert spaces ; moreover , let @xmath44 be any isometry embedding @xmath33 into the symmetric subspace @xmath54 ; the channel @xmath55 , defined by its action @xmath56 $ ] for all @xmath57 , is called a @xmath53-dimensional symmetric channel .",
    "it should be clear then that @xmath53-dimensional symmetric channels are , in particular , antidegradable , with the post - processing channel @xmath58 given by the identity map .",
    "the class of symmetric quantum channels has been identified as the quantum analogue of a _ public channel _",
    "@xcite , since , for a symmetric channel , the receiver and eavesdropper receive the same output  @xcite .      before stating our main result we introduce some further definitions .    a _ ( finite ) ensemble of quantum states _",
    "@xmath59 is defined as a triple @xmath60 , where @xmath20 is a finite - dimensional input hilbert space , @xmath30 is a finite indexing alphabet , and @xmath61 is a collection of quantum states @xmath62 and probabilities @xmath63 .",
    "consider now a quantum channel @xmath32 and an ensemble @xmath64 .",
    "we can then imagine the situation in which a sender ( say , alice ) chooses a letter @xmath65 at random according to the probability distribution @xmath63 , prepares a quantum system in the corresponding state @xmath66 , and sends this through @xmath9 to a receiver ( say , bob ) , who has to guess the input letter chosen by alice .",
    "this setup can be formally described as follows :    [ def : dynamic - guessing ] let @xmath32 be a quantum channel , @xmath67 an ensemble .",

    "accordingly , given another channel @xmath70 , with same input space but generally different output space , one can say that ` @xmath9 is not worse than @xmath71 with respect to @xmath59 ' if @xmath72 . by extending this definition to every possible finite ensemble",
    ", we obtain the following partial ordering relation between quantum channels :    [ def : more - info ] given two quantum channels with the same input space @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we say that ` @xmath17 is _ more informative _ than @xmath18 , ' and denote it as @xmath75 , whenever @xmath76 , for all finite ensembles @xmath59 on @xmath33 .",
    "clearly , guessing games can be also played with more than one channel arranged ` in parallel , ' as follows .",
    "consider for example two quantum channels @xmath32 and @xmath77 and an ensemble defined on the tensor product space @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 .",

    ", we allow the comparison between @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be made in parallel with any possible quantum side channel @xmath77 considered as an auxiliary communication resource .",
    "it is often interesting , however , to constrain the side channel to belong to some restricted class of channels , typically with reduced communication capability . as a trivial example",
    ", definition  [ def : more - info ] can be considered as a special case of definition  [ def : strongly - more - info ] , in which side channels are restricted to those which map all input states to the same output state .",
    "here , for reasons that will be clarified later , we are in particular interested in the case in which the quantum side channel is a symmetric channel @xmath84 , as introduced in definition  [ def : degradable ] :    [ def : weak - more - info ] given two quantum channels with the same input space @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we write @xmath85 whenever there exists a symmetric quantum side channels @xmath84 , with @xmath86 , such that @xmath87 .",

    "the main technical result of this paper is summarised in the following theorem , for which a proof will be given in section  [ sec : back - to - channels ] :    [ theo : main ] let @xmath73 and @xmath74 be two quantum channels with the same input space @xmath33 . then , the following are equivalent :    1 .",

    "in this situation , consider the game - theoretic scenario  [ game ] described in the introduction , in which , at each turn of the game ( corresponding to each use of the channel ) , bob and eve are asked to guess the input chosen by alice . in this case",
    ", it is natural to require the side - channel @xmath1 to be symmetric , so that it serves as a public channel  @xcite , since it conveys the same information to bob and eve .    theorem  [ theo : main ] then implies the following corollary which provides a complete characterization of antidegradable channels in the game - theoretic scenario  [ game ] :    [ coro : main ] a channel is not antidegradable if and only if there exists an encoding strategy for alice which results in bob winning the game [ game ] .",

    "however , before being able to translate theorem  [ theo : equiv ] into its analogue for channels , we first have to understand what sort of channels induce complete ( in the sense of definition  [ def : complete ] ) choi states .",
    "the answer is given by the following definition :    [ def : complete - ch ] a channel @xmath32 is said to be _ complete _ whenever its range contains @xmath155 linearly independent elements .",

    "let us now turn to the special case of @xmath53-dimensional symmetric channels , as introduced in definition  [ def : symmetric ] .",
    "we just show that the channels are complete ; the completeness of the corresponding choi states then comes automatically .",

    ", first of all we notice that , given two channels @xmath256 and @xmath257 , the choi isomorphism ( theorem  [ theo : choi ] ) provides two bipartite states @xmath258 and @xmath259 such that @xmath260",
    ". we can therefore apply theorem  [ theo : equiv ] to @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "since point ( 3 ) of theorem  [ theo : equiv ] requires the comparison to be performed with some additional complete bipartite state , we can take the state @xmath182 appearing in point ( 3 ) of theorem  [ theo : equiv ] to be , in fact , the choi state corresponding to a @xmath263-symmetric channel , which we know it is complete as a consequence of lemma  [ lemma : complete - channels ] .",
    "we then notice that , playing a ` static ' guessing game , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : static - guessing ] ) , with some choi state is statistically equivalent to playing a ` dynamic ' guessing game with the corresponding channel , as described in definition  [ def : dynamic - guessing ] .",
    "the relation between the two approaches is again given by steering .",
    "as already noticed in the proof of lemma  [ lemma : complete - channels ] , for any given channel @xmath32 , its choi state @xmath238 is constructed so that , for any ensemble @xmath264 there exists a povm @xmath265 such that @xmath266 $ ] for all @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore clear that point ( 3 ) in theorem  [ theo : equiv ] is completely equivalent ( in fact , just a reformulation ) of point ( 3 ) in theorem  [ theo : main ] . since point ( 3 ) in theorem",
    "[ theo : equiv ] is also equivalent to point ( 1 ) in theorem  [ theo : equiv ] , we are left to show that point ( 1 ) in theorem  [ theo : equiv ] is just a reformulation of point ( 1 ) in theorem  [ theo : main ] .",
    "the logical steps are summarized as follows : @xmath267 where the first equivalence has been proved above , the second equivalence is in the statement of theorem  [ theo : equiv ] , and only the last equivalence is left to be proved . but",

    "one can extend the results of theorem  [ theo : main ] to convex combinations of channels .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that degradable channels and degradable extensions have especially nice properties which prove to be useful when evaluating their quantum and private capacities .",
    "these properties are also reflected in the game - theoretic framework . in particular , the following two corollaries show how to compare and combine convex combinations of degradable channels and their extensions in this framework .",

    "define the flagged version of the convex combination of @xmath273 as @xmath275 .",
    "then , @xmath276 is strongly more informative than @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath277 .",
    "it was proven in  @xcite that @xmath276 is a degradable extension of @xmath18",

    "then , for @xmath282 and @xmath283 we have that @xmath276 is strongly more informative than @xmath92 : @xmath284 .",
    "it is sufficient to observe that @xmath276 is a degradable extension of @xmath9  @xcite",
    ". then the corollary follows after applying theorem  [ theo : main ] .",
    "we introduced a game - theoretic framework  [ game ] which allowed us to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a channel to be antidegradable .",
    "we showed that for any channel which is not antidegradable , there exists an encoding strategy for which such a channel provides a strict advantage for the two players over the adversary in the guessing game that we defined .",
    "the key ingredients in the proof of this result are the tools of statistical comparison of bipartite quantum states , and the choi isomorphism .",
    "the exact relationship between our game - theoretic framework and the standard information - theoretic framework remains to be explored .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether any inference about the quantum or private capacity of a quantum channel could be made from results obtained in our game - theoretic framework .",
