    "this leads to the conclusion that while the ground state is indeed squeezed ( with the uncertainty profile distortion even diverging for @xmath144 ) the squeeze parameter nevertheless has no thermodynamic effects . for finite - size systems , such as condensates in traps",
    ", we have identified that the thomas - fermi regime ( @xmath212 ) is the interaction regime where one expects to see appreciable squeezing of the ground state .",
    "our second wavefunction @xmath192 is devised specifically to address the issue of pair squeezing in the non - condensate opposite - momenta mode pairs . using results from one of the @xmath0-invariant formulations of the bose condensate @xcite , we have provided an interpretation of this pair squeezing in terms of variables representing density and phase excitations .",
    "we now make contact with relevant results in the literature .",
    "it is worth pointing out that our treatment of gaplessness , where imposing the hugenholtz - pines theorem leads to the condition @xmath213 , is actually equivalent to the popov approximation @xcite where anomalous pair correlation functions ( @xmath8 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are neglected .",
    "this is a simple and direct way to implement gaplessness . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more involved procedure for satisfying the hugenholtz - pines theorem leads to a _",
    "macroscopic _ condensate - mode squeezing .",
    "however this contradicts the scaling relationship @xmath214 that we have derived here directly from the minimization of variational parameters .",
    "other scattered previous discussions of squeezing in the condensate mode @xcite have not addressed clearly the role of this squeezing in the thermodynamic limit . finally , concerning the density fluctuation operators borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that similar operators have appeared in other fixed-@xmath163 formulations of the condensate ground state , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our results on the condensate - mode squeezing prompts questions about the presence of squeezing in _ trapped _ condensates .",
    "study of the quantum state of trapped condensates , either experimentally through quantum state tomography methods or theoretically , is essential for verifying our finite - size scaling relation @xmath215",
    "@xcite have reported @xmath216-function and wigner function calculations of the condensate quantum state , showing squeezing in a number of cases .",
    "however , no systematic analysis of the @xmath163-dependence or interaction - dependence of the squeezing parameter is available .",
    "another question related to the quantum state of the condensate mode is the possibility of non - classical features other than squeezing .",
    "a whole number of quantum states are studied in quantum optics ( fock , thermal , squeezed fock , etc . ) and it is intriguing to ask if , for example , using a squeezed fock state instead of a squeezed coherent state for the @xmath3 mode would gain us complementary insight .",
    "also , other quantum states might be helpful in exploring @xmath48 physics beyond the mean - field level physics we have extracted here for the non - condensate modes .",
    "inclusion of other quantum - state features might also be fruitful for a variational description of finite - temperature , two - dimensional , or trapped bose gases .",
    "a _ real - space _ variational procedure using wavefunctions of jastrow form has often been employed to describe interacting bose condensates @xcite .",
    "a natural question is the relation to our variational description .",
    "presumably , the success of the so - called bijl - dingle - jastrow wavefunction is due to its correctly capturing correlations such as those we have discussed in terms of squeezing .",
    "however , it remains unclear how to extract from real - space jastrow wavefunctions the momentum - space squeezing parameters of the type included in our @xmath217 state @xmath5 ."
