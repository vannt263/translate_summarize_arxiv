    "the discovery of the energetic , stripped - envelope core - collapse sn  1998bw , which was temporally and spatially coincident with grb  980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; patat et al . 2001 ) , provided the first empirical evidence that grbs arise from massive stars . since 1998",
    "there have been several more spectroscopic ( e.g. pian et al . 2006 ; sparre et al .",
    "2011 ; bufano et al . 2012 ; xu et al . 2013 ; schulze et al . 2014 ) and photometric observations ( e.g. stanek et al . 2005 ; bersier et al . 2006 ; cano et al .",
    "2011b ) of supernovae ( sne ) accompanying grbs ( grb - sne ) .",
    "grb - sne are very energetic , possessing , on average , ten times more kinetic energy than sne ibc not associated with grbs ( iwamoto et al .",
    "every single grb - sne that has been spectroscopically classified is of type ic , implying that their outer layers of hydrogen and helium have been lost prior to explosion .",
    "moreover , the blueshifted line velocities in their spectra are much larger than those measured for non - grb sne ibc , approaching velocities more than 10% the speed of light , and which display broad - lined ( bl ) absorption lines .",
    "such rapid line velocities and broad - lined profiles have been seen in the spectra of sne ic - bl not associated with grbs , which are also more energetic and have larger ejecta velocities than sne ibc , though not as extreme as grb - sne ( cano 2013 ) .",
    "the exact nature of the central engine in grb - sne is uncertain , though theory suggests it may being either an accreting black hole , or a rapidly rotating neutron star that possesses a very strong magnetic field . in these models ( e.g. woosley 1993 ; macfadyen et al . 1999 ;",
    "macfadyen et al . 2001 ) , a stellar black hole is created during the core - collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star ( e.g. yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) . the angular momentum",
    "present in the core at the time of collapse leads to the formation of a torus of material that accretes onto the bh , ultimately producing an ultra - relativistic , bi - polar jet along the rotation axis .",
    "once the jets pierce through the star , they interact with themselves producing the initial burst of @xmath0-rays , and later they collide with the surrounding medium , producing the longer - lasting x - ray / optical / radio afterglow ( ag ) .",
    "it has been suggested by bromberg et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that low - luminosity grbs such as grb  060218 and grb  100316d arise from jets that just barely breakout from the stellar surface , and therefore emit less @xmath0-ray radiation .    adding diversity to this scenario is the existence of type ic - bl sn  2009bb ( soderberg et al . 2010 ; pignata et al .",
    "2011 ) . to date , sn  2009bb is one of only two sn ic - bl ( the other being sn  2012ap ; margutti et al . 2014 ; milisavljevic et al .",
    "2014 ) not associated with a grb for which there is compelling observational evidence that they both possessed a central engine that contributed to the explosion of their stellar progenitors .",
    "luminous radio detections of sn  2009bb were attributed by soderberg et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as arising from a substantially relativistic outflow powered by a central engine .",
    "the kinetic energy contained within the relativistic outflow of sn  2009bb was demonstrated to be similar to that of low - luminosity grbs 060218 and 100316d ( margutti et al .",
    "2013 ; margutti et al . 2014 ) , which indirectly suggests that sn  2009bb may have a similar degree of collimation / asymmetry as low - luminosity grb - sne . in the above theoretical scenario ,",
    "sn  2009bb arises from a jet that failed to breakout of the star , possibly because of a less energetic central engine .",
    "another open question is whether grbs and/or grb - sne can be used as standardizable candles . while a few grb - sne have occurred in the local universe , with the relative brightness of the event allowing a direct analysis of their observational and physical properties to be performed , isolating the sn contribution from the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) observations of fainter events",
    "is more complicated . precisely ascertaining the observational properties of the accompanying sne",
    "requires a careful decomposition of the photometric observations .",
    "the degree of accuracy obtained in decomposition methods depends strongly on precisely knowing the total amount of extinction along the line of sight ( both foreground and rest - frame ) , where determining the latter requires assumptions that complicate the analysis .",
    "furthermore , the contribution from the host galaxy needs to be quantified and removed , either by image - subtraction techniques , or by mathematically subtracting the host flux from the observations .",
    "finally , in order to isolate and model the flux from the sn , the temporal behaviour of the optical ag , which arises from the initial grb event , needs to be precisely determined .",
    "if the ag is improperly modelled , the ag contribution can be under- or over - estimated , which affects the resultant sn properties .",
    "therefore , in order for the sn to be modelled accurately , each one of these hurdles needs to be carefully overcome .    several studies ( zeh et al .",
    "2004 ; ferrero et al .",
    "2006 ; cano et al . 2011a ; thne et al .",
    "2011 ; cano 2013 ) have attempted to determine the luminosity ( @xmath1 ) and stretch ( @xmath2 ) factor of grb - sne relative to a template sn , which historically has been sn  1998bw .",
    "these parameters are analogous to the absolute peak sn magnitude and @xmath3 ( the amount the light curve fades from peak light to fifteen days later ) used in the luminosity  decline relation for sne ia ( phillips 1993 ) .",
    "initial studies such as those by ferrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and cano et al .",
    "( 2011a ) noted that no obvious correlation exist in the observer - frame @xmath4-band @xmath1- and @xmath2-factors of several grb - sne .",
    "however , as the grb - sne in their respective samples occurred over a broad range of redshifts ( 0.0085@xmath5 ) , the @xmath4-band light curves ( lcs ) in their respective analyses were all probing different rest - frame wavelengths , and thus different regions of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "encouragingly , a recent analysis by schulze et al .",
    "( 2014 ) looked at the _ approximate _ rest - frame @xmath6-band stretch and luminosity factors of several grb - sne , finding that a rough correlation was present .",
    "an additional analysis by lyman et al .",
    "( 2014 ) also hinted at a correlation between the peak absolute magnitude and @xmath3 of several nearby grb - sne and sn  2009bb .",
    "excitingly , a very recent paper by li & hjorth ( 2014 ) have presented a luminosity  decline correlation between the k - corrected parameter used here to denote the brightness of a given grb - sne in a given filter , but it is rather the correction that arises from observing events occurring at vast cosmological distances , where the observer - frame light arises from bluer rest - frame light that has been redshifted as it traverses through an expanding universe . ] , @xmath6-band , peak absolute magnitude and decay rates from peak of eight grb - sne . reassuringly , their results fully support those presented in this paper .    in this present work",
    "i performed a detailed analysis to precisely account for the varying redshifts of grb - sne in order to determine the _ exact _ rest - frame ( @xmath7 ) stretch and luminosity factors of several grb - sne .",
    "the latest values of the observer - frame ( foreground ) extinction due to the milky way ( mw ) from schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) have been used , as well as values for the rest - frame extinction derived by several works ( see the appendix for a detailed discussion of each grb - sn ) . importantly , this analysis is an improvement over previous works ( e.g. cano et al . 2011a ; cano 2013 ) by calculating the _ redshift - corrected _ rest - frame extinction using the value of @xmath8 , and the mw / smc / lmc templates of pei ( 1992 ) .",
    "this is more precise than considering a total line - of - sight extinction for a given filter , for at larger redshifts , the extinction measured in a certain observer - frame filter will arise from bluer light in the rest - frame that will be correspondingly more extinguished .",
    "a @xmath9cdm cosmology constrained by planck ( planck collaboration et al .",
    "2013 ) has been employed here , where @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the method used involves decomposing the optical lcs to isolate flux coming from just the accompanying sn .",
    "previous papers ( e.g. zeh et al .",
    "2004 ; ferrero et al .",
    "2006 ; cano et al . 2011a ; thne et al . 2011 ; cano 2013 ) have used similar methods to determine the brightness ( @xmath1 ) and width / stretch factor ( @xmath2 ) in a particular filter relative to a template sn , which historically has been sn  1998bw due to its well - sampled lc and well - determined temporal evolution .",
    "a step - by - step visual diagram of the decomposition method is displayed in fig . [ fig:090618 ] .    for each grb",
    "- sn in the sample , i collected all of the available data published in the literature ( table [ table : refs ] ) . while the amount of sn - bumps in optical and nir lcs is more than 20 ( cano 2013 ) , the analysis has been limited to those events where : ( 1 ) observations were in at least two filters in order to interpolate between filters to get to the precise to rest - frame wavelength ) , ( 2 ) observations of the host had been obtained , ( 3 ) knowledge of the rest - frame extinction had been determined , and ( 4 ) the lc is well sampled enough that the ag and sn temporal behaviour can be accurately and , importantly , unambiguously modelled . using this criteria , eight grb - sne",
    "were analysed , not including the template sn  1998bw .",
    "once the data were gathered , the magnitudes were corrected for foreground extinction and then converted into monochromatic fluxes , using the effective wavelengths and flux zeropoints in fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "a vital part of the decomposition is quantifying the total extinction along the line of sight .",
    "observer - frame ( foreground ) extinction due to various sight - lines through the milky way was corrected for using the dust maps of schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) .",
    "the rest - frame extinction is more complex to determine .",
    "one way is to obtain a spectrum of the host galaxy after the grb and sn have faded away , and use either absorption or emission line diagnostics to estimate the host - galaxy extinction .",
    "the draw - back of this method is that for grbs at higher redshift that can not be resolved in their host galaxy , one has to make the assumption that the integrated dust extinction of the entire galaxy is a suitable proxy for the dust - extinction local to the grb event itself , which for some grb events has proved to be a poor proxy ( e.g. krhler et al . 2011 ) .",
    "another method is to model early observations of the ag at optical , ir and x - ray frequencies , and fit the data with extinction curves based on the smc , lmc and mw ( e.g. kann et al .",
    "2006 ; guidorzi et al .",
    "2009 ; kann et al . 2010",
    "; cano et al . 2011b ; olivares et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the rest - frame extinction for the majority of the grb - sne in the sample has been determined using the latter method .",
    "note that the rest - frame extinction is only corrected for after ( 1 ) the observer - frame host contribution has been removed , and ( 2 ) the interpolation described below was completed .    for each grb - sn",
    ", the light is attributed as coming from three different sources : ( 1 ) the ag , which is associated with the grb event , ( 2 ) the sn , and ( 3 ) the constant source of flux coming from the host galaxy . the host contribution was determined and removed either by image subtraction ( e.g. grb 011121 ; bloom et al .",
    "2002 ) , or by observing the host galaxy at late times after the ag and sn have faded away , and then mathematically subtracting the host flux from the earlier epochs ( e.g. grb 130831a ; cano et al .",
    "note that the host galaxy contribution needs to be removed at this stage , because once the sed interpolation is performed , we do not have knowledge of the brightness of the host galaxy at the redshift - corrected , observer - frame wavelength to later remove .",
    "after removing the host contribution , the remaining data is attributed to coming from just the ag and sn .    at this point ,",
    "observer - frame seds at each epoch of contemporaneous optical data for each grb - sn are created .",
    "for example , for grb 090618 ( redshift @xmath14 ) , i have used observer - frame @xmath15 and @xmath16 data from cano et al . (",
    "2011b ) , which using the effective wavelengths of each filter from fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) corresponds to observer - frame wavelengths of 6588 and 7706 @xmath17 respectively .",
    "rest - frame @xmath18-band is 4448  , which corresponds to observer - frame 4448(@xmath19 ) @xmath20 6850  .",
    "therefore at each epoch of host - subtracted data , the sed has been interpolated to this wavelength to extract the flux at redshifted rest - frame @xmath18-band .",
    "once the redshift - corrected lc is created , which has now been corrected for rest - frame extinction , it needs to be modelled to determine the temporal behaviour of the ag , as well as the properties of the accompanying sn .",
    "standard grb theory suggests that the light powering the ag is synchrotron in origin , and therefore follows a power - law behaviour in both time and frequency ( @xmath21 , where the respective decay and energy spectral indices are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while @xmath24 is the trigger time of the grb ) .",
    "it is therefore very beneficial to have a wide time coverage of the entire event in order to accurately determine the rate at which the ag decays , especially at late times when the sn is the dominant source of flux .",
    "finally , in order to measure the luminosity and stretch factors of each accompanying sn , i used a redshifted ( k - corrected ) template of sn 1998bw , originally presented in cano ( 2013 ) .",
    "the templates are created using a c - program that calculates the rest - frame filter lcs for each sn and interpolates in frequency and time over the original lcs of sn  1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; patat et al . 2001 ) , and then calculates the luminosity distance using a @xmath9cdm cosmology to rescale the flux density .",
    "the program generates a synthetic lc at the desired observer - frame wavelength .",
    "the synthetic lc is then fitted with a log - linear spline using pyxplot .",
    "if we denote the log - linear spline as function @xmath25 , then to determine the stretch and luminosity factors of each sn relative to the template we use a new function of the form @xmath26 .",
    "this function is added to the ag function , and the data is fitted to simultaneously determine the decay rate of the ag at all times , as well as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , all of which are free parameters .",
    "it is seen that the lc of grb  090618 has a `` break '' in it , where a steepening of the ag occurs at some break time ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , two additional free parameters are included ( @xmath27 and the decay constant after the break ) .",
    "a summary of the best - fit parameters are presented in table [ table : params ] .    throughout this analysis",
    "there are several sources of errors : host - galaxy subtraction , afterglow subtraction , uncertainties in the observer - frame and rest - frame extinction and the sed construction and interpolation .",
    "each one of these procedures / quantities introduces an error into the final calculation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the errors of the first four are photometric , and the errors have been added in quadrature .",
    "a conservative estimation of the total error in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which includes an estimate of the error introduced by the sed interpolatiom , is of order 20% , and is the fractional value adopted in table [ table : params ] .",
    "a visual example of the error propagation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:090618 ] , where the final errorbars of the rest - frame @xmath18-band lc are larger than those of the observer - frame @xmath4- and @xmath16-band lcs as they also include the uncertainty associated with the rest - frame extinction .",
    "for every grb - sne in this sample , i interpolated the optical / nir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to exact rest - frame frequencies , and then performed the lc decomposition method to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 at every possible rest - frame filter .",
    "the resultant value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in each rest - frame filter provides an independent measure of the shape of the sn relative to the template sn .",
    "note that this approach can be considered to be model - dependent as it relies on using a template sn , rather than focusing on the sn properties in and of themselves . as such",
    ", i have assumed that each grb - sn evolves in a similar fashion to the template sn , corrected only for the unique intrinsic brightness and temporal evolution of each grb - sn , but with similar color evolution .",
    "it has been shown by e.g. lyman et al .",
    "( 2014 ) that grb - sne , and all sne for that matter , will possess a unique colour evolution .",
    "however , it should be noted that a grb - sn with @xmath1 and @xmath2 values that are not identical do account for their unique colour evolution relative to the template sn .",
    "for example , a fiducial event with @xmath28 and @xmath29 implies that the sn gets redder over time more rapidly than an event with @xmath30 ( in the former event , @xmath31 will increase more rapidly after peak light as the sn fades more rapidly in @xmath4 relative to @xmath32 ) . as such ,",
    "the method used here does provide a way to account for the unique colour evolution of each grb - sn .    with this caveat in mind ,",
    "the analysis of li & hjorth ( 2014 ) can be considered to be less model dependent in this respect , though it should be considered that their analysis still relies on using the sed of sn  1998bw as a template when calculating the k - correction of those events in their sample where their constructed sed is incomplete .",
    "next , using python programs that employ numpy and scipy algorithms , i performed a non - linear least squares analysis on the combined dataset to find the best - fitting values of the slope ( @xmath33 ) and y - intercept ( @xmath34 ) to a straight line that was fitted to the data .",
    "the fit was performed with the optimization.curve@xmath35fit routine from scipy , which uses the levenberg - marquardt algorithm to fit the line to the data .",
    "the analysis was designed to ( necessarily ) consider the error in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to obtain an estimate of the error in @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i performed a monte carlo analysis , where a new dataset is created from the original by choosing a new value from a gaussian that is centered on each original datapoint , and whose standard deviation in each direction is equal to the error in that variable .",
    "the simulation was performed 10,000 times , each time fitting the straight line to the new dataset .",
    "the estimated errors of @xmath33 and @xmath34 arise from their resultant distributions , where the quoted 1-@xmath36 errors are the standard deviation of each distribution .",
    "the best - fitting values are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "interestingly , this result implies that grb - sne do not follow a 1:1 ratio of @xmath1:@xmath2 , rather @xmath1 increases more rapidly with larger @xmath2 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig : grb - sne ] .",
    "it is confirmed that a statistically significant correlation is present in the data .",
    "the pearson s correlation coefficient of the sample ( @xmath39 ) is @xmath40 , while the two - point probability of a chance correlation is @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth noting that every single nearby , spectroscopically identified grb - sn obeys this relation , including the `` big five '' grb - sne ( grbs 980425 , 030329 , 031203 , 060218 and 100316d ) and grb  120422a . the notable absentee is recent grb 130427a , which is associated with sn  2013cq ( xu et al .",
    "the exclusion of this event is dictated by its complex ag behaviour and uncertain host galaxy contribution ( perley et al .",
    "2014 ) , which , like grb 030329 , severely hinders our ability to precisely decompose the optical and nir observations , and will most likely require more advanced decomposition methods such as those used by deng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) on the spectra obtained of grb 030329 .    motivated by the observation that sn  2009bb is also a relativistic , type ic - bl sn , i included its @xmath42 stretch and luminosity factors from cano ( 2013 ) with the grb - sne sample .",
    "i have adopted an uncertainty of 20% in the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for sn  2009bb in this analysis , which are larger than those originally presented in cano ( 2013 ) .",
    "i then refit the data using the non - linear least squares and monte carlo analysis ( figure [ fig : sne_grb_icbl ] ) .",
    "the pearson s correlation coefficient for this new sample is @xmath43 , with a chance probability of @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in good agreement with those determined from just the grb - sn sample .",
    "this result suggests that perhaps all engine - driven sne are potential standardizable candles , though this conclusion is understandably tentative as it is based only on a single non - grb - sn event .",
    "next i considered the sample of non - grb sne ibc originally presented in cano ( 2013 ) , where i determined @xmath1 and @xmath2 relative to sn  1998bw , to search for a similar correlation . only those events where the total extinction along the line of sight was known , and for which the host galaxy contribution was also removed , were included in the analysis .",
    "note that the stretch factors of the sne ibc are not corrected for redshift effects , however the bulk of the sne ibc considered here have redshifts of order @xmath47 .",
    "the resultant effect on the transformation between observer - frame to rest - frame for these very nearby events is of order a few percent , and thus does not fundamentally affect the results . plotted in figure [ fig : sne_ibc ] are the @xmath1- and @xmath2-factors of different sne ibc sub - types ( ib , ic and ic - bl ) , along with the best - fitting line , and 2-@xmath36 uncertainty region found for the grb - sne sample",
    ". also displayed is the pearson s correlation coefficient for each sample , as well as the combined sne ibc sample .",
    "the low value of @xmath48 for each sn subtype highlights their unsuitability as standardizable candles .",
    "it has been noted that likely all core - collapse sne possess a degree of asphericity ( wang & wheeler 2008 ) , where the asphericity arises from , and is driven by , rayleigh - taylor instabilities surrounding the collapsing core .",
    "this is in contrast to grb - sne , where asphericity also arises from the relativistic jet that is launched by the central engine .",
    "observationally , asphericity in sne ibc has been determined via different methods , such as modelling of optically thin nebular emission lines ( e.g. mazzali et al .",
    "2005 ; maeda et al . 2008 ; taubenberger et al .",
    "2009 ) , where the emission lines of elements such as oxygen trace the overall velocity distribution of the ejecta .",
    "another method is comparing the results of hydrodynamical explosion & radiative transfer models with observations , in order to determine the ejecta geometry .",
    "for example , it was shown that a large excess of luminosity along the polar / rotation axis relative to the equatorial axis ( ratio of 4:1 ) was needed to explain the early bolometric lc of sn  1998bw ( maeda et al .",
    "it is very probable that all grb - sne are highly aspherical ( woosley & bloom 2006 ; maeda et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , because we detect the initial @xmath0-ray emission , as observers we must be near to the jet - axis , or the high - energy emission would not be observed .",
    "the subsequent sn therefore must also be viewed close to the jet axis , meaning that we are observing each event at approximately the same viewing angle .",
    "conversely , because the non - grb sne ibc are viewed at all possible viewing angles , and with each possessing a different degree of asphericity , it is not unexpected that no relation exists between the luminosity and stretch factors of these sne ibc relative to the template sn . in the case of sn  2009bb , which was observed to be an engine - driven sn with a small amount of material moving at relativistic velocities similar to those of the low - energy grb - sne , the results here reinforce the supposition made by pignata et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , that sn  2009bb was likely observed close to the polar / elongated axis .",
    "it is tempting then to conclude that the possible use of grb - sne as standardizable candles arises , at least in part , from them possessing a similar ejecta geometry that is observed at roughly the same viewing angle .",
    "moreover , as the lcs of type i sne ( including grb - sne ) are powered solely by the radioactive decay of @xmath49ni  @xmath50  @xmath51co  @xmath50 @xmath52fe ( arnett 1982 ; woosley & weaver 1986 ) , the fact that grb - sne have a distribution of brightnesses ( i.e. @xmath1 values ) results from each sn nucleosynthesizing a different amount of @xmath53ni .",
    "if grb - sne are accurately described by the collapsar model , then the sn is expected to be driven by energy deposited by the jet as it disrupts the star , as well as by an energetic wind driven by viscous interactions in the accretion disk surrounding the newly formed compact object ( macfadyen et al .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis of @xmath53ni occurs deep in the star as material displaced by the jet moves away at supersonic speeds , while further nucleosynthesis is driven by the wind from the accretion disk , with the latter possibly being the dominant producer of @xmath53ni for events such as sn  1998bw ( macfadyen et al .",
    "a nive conclusion to be drawn is that the correlation presented here suggests that a relation exists between the strength and energetics produced by the central engine and the resultant nucleosynthetic yields of @xmath53ni .",
    "moreover , the lack of correlation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the non - grb sne implies that the explosion and nucleosynthesis mechanism(s ) are not correlated .",
    "this nive scenario does not account for the physical conditions of the sne however . in the context of sne ia , which are , of course , also standardizable candles ,",
    "their lcs are also powered solely by the radioactive decay of nickel and cobalt , the amount of which determines the lc s peak brightness and width .",
    "the width also depends on the photon diffusion time , which in turn depends on the physical distribution of the nickel in the ejecta , as well as the mean opacity of the ejecta . in general , the opacity increases with increasing temperature and ionization ( woosley et al .",
    "2007 ) , thus implying that more nickel present in the ejecta leads to larger diffusion times .",
    "this directly implies that fainter sne ia fade faster than brighter sne ia , thus satisfying the luminosity  decline relation ( phillips 1993 ) .",
    "this is not the only effect however , as the distribution of nickel in the ejecta also affects how the lc evolves , where nickel located further out has a faster bolometric lc decline .",
    "additionally , following maximum @xmath18-band light , sne ia colours are increasingly affected by the development of fe ii and co ii lines that blanket / suppress the blue @xmath18-band light .",
    "dimmer sne are thus cooler , and the onset of fe iii @xmath50 fe ii recombination occurs quicker than in brighter sne ia , resulting in a more rapid evolution to redder colours ( kasen & woosley 2007 )",
    ". therefore the faster @xmath18-band decline rate of dimmer sne ia reflects their faster ionization evolution , and provides additional clues as to why fainter sne ia fade more rapidly .",
    "thus , as the lcs of grb - sne are also powered by radioactive decay , the physics that govern sne ia also govern those of grb - sne , and may go some way to explaining why grb - sne are also standardizable candles .",
    "in this paper i have shown that a statistically significant correlation exists between the brightness ( @xmath1 ) and width / shape ( @xmath2 ) of the lcs of grb - sne ( the correlation coefficient being @xmath54 ) relative to a template sn ( sn  1998bw ) .",
    "this result highlights their potential use as standardizable candles .",
    "every single nearby , spectroscopically identified grb - sn obeys this relation , including grbs 980425 , 030329 , 031203 , 060218 , 100316d , 120422a and 130831a .",

    "when the relativistic , engine - driven type ic - bl sn  2009bb ( which is not associated with a grb ) was included in the analysis , it too was seen to follow this correlation ( @xmath55 for the entire sample ) .",
    "this highlights the possibility that perhaps all engine - driven sne may eventually be used as standardizable candles , though this conjecture is very tentative as it is based on only a single event .    in this analysis",
    ", there are several sources of error that need to be considered .",
    "these errors arise from the ag and host - galaxy subtractions , the uncertainties in the observer - frame and rest - frame extinction , and the sed interpolation . in an attempt to properly account for the cumulative effect these will have on the resultant correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "i have adopted a conservative error of 20% in the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the adoption of this large error estimate is justified when compared with the original analysis of sne ia in phillips ( 1993 ) .",
    "all nine sne ia in his sample were located at distances closer than sn  1998bw , which itself is the closest grb - sn to date . as such",
    ", the sne ia were all brighter than the grb - sne in the sample investigated here , and all had well - determined line - of - sight extinction values .",
    "moreover , no uncertainties were introduced from ag subtraction or sed construction and interpolation when determining the peak sn magnitudes and @xmath3 values .",
    "this all implies that the luminosity  decline relation in phillips ( 1993 ) is naturally better determined than the complicated decomposition technique employed here .    with one eye on the future ,",
    "the modest size of the sample in this work highlights the need for additional observations of grb - sne , especially to obtain high - cadence and very importantly , multi - wavelength observations of each event .",
    "the addition of further high - quality investigations of grb - sne will hopefully lead to a refinement and improvement of the scatter in the @xmath1@xmath2 relationship , which in turn will allow for the possibility for their eventual use as a standardizable candle .",
    "once the redshift of a grb has been determined , the resultant campaign to observe the accompanying sn should consider the rest - frame wavelengths and obtain observations to bracket as many rest - frame filters as possible . finally , but very importantly , in order to accurately determine the brightness and shape of the accompanying sn ,",
    "it is necessary to have a good time coverage of the event at all epochs , as an incorrect ag model will give incorrect sn properties .",
