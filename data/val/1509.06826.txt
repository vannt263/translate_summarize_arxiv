    "the tensor product structure of the vector space describing composite quantum systems is the key to the very definition of quantum entanglement .",
    "it was noticed many years ago @xcite that the same mathematical structure arises in the description of classical optical fields , yielding what has been called classical entanglement or non - separability .",
    "this analogue of quantum entanglement allows us to translate quantum information concepts to the classical domain .",
    "our first contribution to this topic was the demonstration of a topological phase acquired by maximally entangled qubits in the spin - orbit modes of a classical laser beam @xcite .",
    "later , we investigated a bell inequality to characterize the nonseparability between polarization and the spatial mode structure of classical paraxial beams @xcite .",
    "this investigation was also later taken up in the single photon regime by other groups @xcite .",
    "recently , the role of bell inequalities in classical optics has drawn a fair amount of attention , being addressed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "this new understanding of classical non - separability resulted in new optical applications inspired by quantum information @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using the polarization degree of freedom to control spatial modes has resulted in a number of applications both in classical and quantum optics .",
    "examples include quantum image control @xcite , spin to orbital degree of freedom information transfer @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , controlled gates @xcite , quantum games @xcite , environment - induced entanglement @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "the coherent superposition of different transverse modes carrying orthogonal polarizations creates polarization vortices that have been proved useful for classical and quantum encoding of information @xcite .",
    "one of the chief uses of quantum entanglement is information distribution based on quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "it enables one party ( alice ) , to transfer an arbitrary , unknown quantum state to a second party ( bob ) via the use of previously shared quantum entanglement and classical communication @xcite .",
    "an investigation of an optical analogue of the teleportation protocol has been recently reported in @xcite , in which states of orbital angular momentum were transferred to polarization .    here",
    "we report on experiments in which we perform the interferometric transfer of arbitrary polarization modes to the transverse spatial structure of a paraxial , classical laser beam .",
    "this is achieved by mapping the steps of a single - qubit quantum teleportation protocol into a sequence of controlled optical mode operations . in our experiments ,",
    "the role of quantum entanglement is played by a classical non - separable joint state of the path and transverse spatial degrees of freedom of the laser beam .",
    "our protocol translates the relative ease of polarization preparation into the possibility of high - quality preparation of arbitrary states of transverse modes of a laser beam .",
    "our results push further the analogy between classical and quantum entanglement , showing new optical applications are possible if we explore this analogy in depth .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ formal ] we describe the optical modes we use to describe the different degrees - of - freedom we manipulate in our experiment . in section [ protocol ]",

    "we describe the experimental setup and results , with some concluding remarks in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "our experiment involves interference and polarization measurements on first - order paraxial beams .",
    "we will work in the computational basis of laguerre - gaussian modes of width @xmath0 , carrying orbital angular momentum . inside an interferometer",
    ", these modes are distributed between two alternative paths determined by the longitudinal propagation axes of the modes . for simplicity , we assume two axes lying parallel to the @xmath1 direction of the coordinate system , lying a distance @xmath2 apart from each other , so that the overlap between transverse modes belonging to different paths is negligible",
    ". we shall refer to these paths as @xmath3 and @xmath4 and designate their locations on the @xmath5 plane by the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we describe the transverse modes in the normalized laguerre - gaussian basis and focus on the first order , two - dimensional vector space .",

    "this arrangement is depicted in fig.([modes ] ) .",
    "cross section view of the two - path propagation with the relative transverse coordinates . ]    transverse modes lying on different paths do not overlap and are orthogonal , regardless of their functional form .",
    "therefore , we can formally represent the path modes as an independent degree of freedom and describe them by a pair of column vectors @xmath13\\,,\\quad \\chi_{1 } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{l } 0\\\\ 1   \\end{array}\\right ] \\;.",
    "\\label{colunas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then build the path - transverse mode structure as a tensor product @xmath14 . finally , each transverse mode lying on each path has two possible polarizations described by horizontal and vertical unit vectors @xmath15 .",

    "transverse modes can be transformed by astigmatic mode converters or dove prisms .",
    "path modes can be operated on with beam splitters and phase shifters .",
    "controlled operations are easily performed when transverse mode or polarization transformations are applied on one path only . with this set of operations",
    "we will implement the steps of a quantum teleportation protocol to transfer an arbitrary polarization superposition to the transverse mode , using the resource of classical , non - separable states of the path and transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "the teleportation protocol involves three steps .",
    "first , an arbitrary polarization mode is prepared on the laser beam impinging on path @xmath17 .",
    "then , the transverse mode is entangled with the path degree of freedom with a conditional operation .",
    "finally , a bell projection is performed on the path and polarization degrees of freedom , resulting in four transverse mode superpositions at the different outputs .",
    "one of them ( the _ successful _ output ) will carry a transversal mode state which directly corresponds to the initial polarisation state .",
    "the other three outputs will correspond to the initial polarisation state changed by pauli operations , in direct correspondence with the one - qubit quantum teleportation protocol . in what follows",
    "we describe each step in more detail .      in order to demonstrate the protocol",
    ", we sent a sequence of twelve different polarization modes prepared with a half and a quarter waveplates .",
    "this sequence is represented in the bloch sphere shown in fig.([sphere ] ) , where the corresponding transverse modes produced are also represented . by rotating the orientations of the waveplates , we prepare polarisation states which interpolate between three mutually unbiased modes : _ i-",

    "an essential ingredient of the protocol is the ability to perform a bell measurement in the degrees of freedom corresponding to the polarisation and beam path .",
    "this can be done via a controlled unitary gate between them , followed by a projection on single - system bases . in our scheme",
    ", we make a path dependent polarization transformation followed by a beam splitter operation ( which corresponds to a hadamard gate on the path mode ) , followed by polarization measurements with polarizing beam splitters .",
