    "growth phenomena in non - equilibrium conditions  @xcite are an important subject of condensed matter physics . many properties of specific devices depend on rough surfaces that are produced under such non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "technological applications such as conducting - field emitter devices that operate in ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions , require the control of several properties such as the surface morphology .",
    "it is well known that large values of the current intensity on field emitter devices are connected to extremely small values of the effective emitting area @xcite .",
    "one method to increase the effective area of emission is to use surfaces with an ending fractal boundary with self - affine scale invariance instead of considering structurally regular tips .",
    "in fact , the connection between the morphology of irregular surfaces including sharp conducting tips and the field emission properties has been a subject of intense research @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "cabrera _ et al .",
    "_ measured experimentally the current - voltage ( i - v ) of a tunnel junction consisting of a sharp electron emitting metallic tip at a variable distance (  @xmath3 \" ) from a planar collector and emitting electrons using electric field assisted emission .",
    "their results showed scale invariance of the tunnel junction with respect to changes in @xmath3 ( from few @xmath4 to several @xmath5 ) , which means that the physical laws governing the flow of current are invariant with respect the changes of the length scale @xmath3 .",
    "however , this behavior fails when @xmath3 was only a few nanometers as showed in reference @xcite .",
    "the reported scale invariance for a single tip can be regarded as a preliminary study of the more general problem of field emission by an irregular conducting interface that will be considered in this work .    in the statistical mechanics framework",
    ", macroscopic laws that emerge in surface growth can be explained at different spatial and temporal scales considering a theoretical microscopic description that involves simple probabilistic laws .",
    "an interesting related point is the possibility of modeling these systems so that in the large - scale limit ( i.e. , where the scale invariance arises ) , they do not depend on the corresponding details but only on symmetries and the corresponding conservation laws .",
    "previous theoretical works related to the emitting properties of rough surfaces @xcite have studied the behavior of the electric potential in a region bounded by a rough conducting profile / surface and a smooth conducting line / plane , which is held to a constant voltage bias . in particular , the references @xcite analyzed the roughness exponent of the equipotential lines ( surfaces ) in 2 ( 3)-dimensional systems . however , to our knowledge , no previous work discussed the properties of equipotential lines / surfaces under the perspective of its height distribution properties .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the height distribution properties of a family of equipotential lines in a region that is confined by a rough profile , which is regarded as an electron - emitting cathode , and a flat anode which is placed sufficiently away from it .",
    "the profile results from a numerical simulation of the deposition and growth surface models , whereas the cathode and the anode are subject to an electric potential difference .",
    "our results are mainly based on the model that was introduced by silva and moreira @xcite , which is compared to those obtained for the simpler family model @xcite in some limiting cases .",
    "we emphasize two consequences of our results for the following aspects : the height distribution presents a more detailed characterization of the equipotential lines than that provided by the roughness exponents and such investigation of equipotential lines offers a much more reliable method to characterize the surface . for particular applications , our work can contribute to elucidate the image distortions in probe microscopies such as electrostatic force microscopy ( efm ) , where the knowledge of the electric field distribution along the tip probe is relevant to extract morphological information about the real irregular surface .",
    "this main conclusion from our work is particularly useful to study surfaces under the influence of non - linear mechanisms in the growth phase , where the surface width is not expressed as a power law with a single growth exponent for a large number of deposited monolayers .",
    "this investigation is also motivated by the quoted experimental aspects related to the electronic properties of rough surfaces and the recent theoretical advances regarding the solution of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite in d = 1 + 1 , where , in general , @xmath6 indicates that a system composed by a n - dimensional substrate ( here , 1-dimensional ) and an extra dimension to where an important effect produced by the substrate is propagated .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec0 ] , we describe the main features of the used models and emphasize the conditions under which they reproduce the typical features of the kpz and edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite growth dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ seci ] , we describe the methodology to calculate and characterize of the equipotential lines . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , we discuss our results for the morphological properties of equipotential lines and analyze the corresponding behavior of the skewness and kurtosis with the electric potential . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize the results and present our conclusions .",
    "it is convenient to discuss the properties of the computational surface growth models that are used in this work with those of the kpz equation in @xmath7 dimensions    @xmath8    where @xmath9 represents the height of the profile in the @xmath10 direction with respect to the line , @xmath11 , that describes the flat profile at @xmath12 .",
    ". [ eq00 ] comprises several terms that consider the essential features of a stochastic surface growth .",
    "these features include irreversibility and locality , which enhance the surface roughness . in eq .",
    "] @xmath13 corresponds to a constant driving force , @xmath14 is the diffusion coefficient of the deposited atoms on the surface , and @xmath15 is a white gaussian noise that mimics the stochastic nature of the growth process . the non - linear term accounts for a considerable number of experimental results @xcite for the height distribution .",
    "many of them can not be described by a gaussian function , which is the solution of the linear ew equation , which corresponds to setting @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ eq00 ] .",
    "the investigated model depends on a parameter @xmath1 , which describes the probability that the deposited particle follows the restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) local rule , whereas @xmath17 is the probability related to the ballistic deposition ( bd ) rule .",
    "both rsos and bd discrete models belong to the universality class that is defined by the kpz equation but are characterized by negative and positive values of the parameter @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "although the used model has not been proved to be equivalent to a kpz equation , recent numerical investigations suggest that a change in the probability @xmath1 changes the value of @xmath18 in a kpz equation , which may be suitable to describe the competitive model @xcite .",
    "for almost all ranges of @xmath1 , a growing profile first experiences a transient phase before attaining a stationary growth regime , where its width @xmath19 scales with the number of monolayers with the typical exponent @xmath20 of the kpz universality class . for finite profiles ,",
    "this regime is interrupted when @xmath19 exponentially relaxes to a saturation regime and becomes constant . in this work ,",
    "we analyze only rough interfaces in the growth regime , which corresponds to typical experimental conditions . in the first transient phase , depending on @xmath1 , the growth exponent can reach values close to those typical of ew dynamics . starting from @xmath21 , the length of the transient phase increases until a specific value @xmath22 , where the ew typical value is always valid . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the model reaches kpz scaling again after a decreasing transient time @xcite . because the condition @xmath24 is very special",
    ", we find it wise to compare the properties of the profiles and equipotential lines with those obtained when the cathode is represented by family - model produced profile @xcite , which shows the ew properties notably clearly .",
    "the interesting behavior of the competitive model makes it suitable to investigate how the equipotential lines change when @xmath1 is selected to reproduce either kpz or ew dynamics , and for a fixed value of @xmath1 , how the magnitude of the non - linear terms affects the ew - kpz crossover as a function of time @xcite , which is particularly important for experimental interests .",
    "indeed , the competition between physical mechanisms is present in many real processes in thin - film science",
    ". then , the actual study clearly advances on the previously one where single models were considered , and the roughness exponent of equipotential lines were evaluated without a perspective for height distribution properties .",
    "the distribution of height fluctuations of the kpz equation , for a flat initial condition , can be expressed by gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) tracy - widom ( tw ) distributions  @xcite .",
    "therefore our results can be better appreciated by comparing the skewness ( @xmath25 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath26 ) of the equipotential height distributions with the typical tw values for the corresponding quantities .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the average distance from the equipotential lines to the cathode and anode .",
    "such dependence has intrinsic features according to whether @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "a third distinct behavior is observed at @xmath29 , when the profile falls into an ew universality class .",
    "we emphasize again that our investigation opens the possibility of analyzing the effects on the behavior of equipotential lines of distinct surfaces with growth exponents near those that feature an ew class .",
    "this possibility is important because of the emergence of local growth exponents in the first transient growth phase , which is near the phase that characterizes the ew dynamics when @xmath30 .",
    "as shown in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , our results indicate that the height distributions of equipotential lines for such transient patterns are clearly different from those obtained for an actual ew profile , no matter whether they are produced using the competitive model at @xmath29 or the family model .",
    "the current investigation starts by constructing the rough profile @xmath31 , which acts as the cathode and results from one of the quoted deposition models . here ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath10 are integer numbers that represent distance measured in terms of some basic unit distance @xmath33 , the precise size of which is not important in a theory of the kind under discussion .",
    "the growth process along the @xmath10 direction of the considered @xmath34 system ( one - dimensional substrate + height , as mentioned in sec.[intro ] ) starts with a flat substrate @xmath11 , where @xmath32 is an integer number , and @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the column height @xmath31 is the @xmath10 coordinate of the topmost adatom at position @xmath32 .",
    "we have used profiles with lateral size up to @xmath36 and up to @xmath37 deposited monolayers ( ml ) . for such parameter values , finite - size effects no longer",
    "influence the interpretation of our results and can be neglected . during the growth process",
    ", the number of monolayers is also referred to as the integration time @xmath38 ; in this way , each time unit corresponds to the deposition of @xmath39 particles . for the convenience of using a unified notation for all profiles and equipotential lines , let us switch from @xmath31 to @xmath40 , where we emphasize the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath38 .",
    "the subscript @xmath1 stands for the probability of choosing the rsos rule in the competitive model .",
    "finally , the subscript @xmath41 is used to identify the constant value of the equipotential line . in this work , @xmath42 and @xmath43 correspond to the cathode and anode surfaces , respectively .",
    "the flat anode , which is defined by @xmath44 , is placed at a distance @xmath45 away from the cathode .",
    "@xmath45 is measured by the number of vertical spacings between the average height of the profile @xmath46 $ ] and the flat anode , i.e :    @xmath47    as previously indicated , @xmath48 is evaluated at @xmath49 , except if explicitly indicated .    to compare the results for different rough profiles",
    ", we fixed the value of @xmath45 .",
    "as a consequence @xmath44 , which is measured with respect to the substrate where the film is grown , changes with @xmath1 . in this way , to select a proper and fixed value of @xmath45 , such that for any value of @xmath1 the anode is sufficiently away from the cathode , we first determined the value of @xmath1 for which the roughness @xmath19 ( defined in eq .",
    "[ eq2a ] ) attains its maximum , which is @xmath21 when @xmath50 .",
    "next , we identified the vertical coordinate of the highest peak @xmath51 for this value of @xmath1 and set @xmath52 , which result , using eq .",

    "let us comment on the reasons to choose the particular value of @xmath3 used in this work .",
    "for @xmath54 , the results are expected to be largely independent of the precise value of @xmath3 , but the computational work is largely increased .",
    "we have observed that , for all the rough profiles , the equipotential lines become flat and parallel to the @xmath32 axis very rapidly after the value of @xmath10 surpasses the highest peak .",
    "therefore , we choose the value @xmath55 , which corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "we use this average distance for all @xmath1 , because it is already sufficient large to have very smooth equipotential lines ( with roughness exponent , @xmath57 , near to unity @xcite ) that are observed at the flat anode .",
    "if we consider the basic unit distance @xmath58 nm , we obtain @xmath59 nm for @xmath21 , and @xmath60 @xmath61 m , which correspond to the typical scale used in the non - contact mode in atomic force microscopy ( like efm ) where the electrostatic force is probed .",
    "then , the results of this work can motivate experimental realizations in this regime .",
    "observed at this angle , the geometrical set up depends on two different scales ( expressed by @xmath39 and @xmath62 ) along the horizontal and vertical directions .",

    "when @xmath49 , the profiles that are grown using the competitive model are in the asymptotic growth regime ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "this regime corresponds to typical experimental conditions , in contrast to the exponential relaxation that is observed in steady - state ( long - time ) properties .",

    "the system is in the critical point and the corresponding growth regime is such that @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the ew growth exponent .",
    "the next step is to compute the equipotential lines , @xmath71 .",
    "hence , we numerically solve laplace s equation    @xmath72    for the electric potential @xmath41 in the region between the two conductors , which are held at constant potential values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the rough cathode and the flat anode that is parallel to the @xmath32 axis , respectively .",

    "further morphological aspects of the profile have been revealed by our results .",
    "let us define the set of peaks @xmath175 in an equipotential line .",
    "a point @xmath176 , where its associated vertical coordinate is larger than those of its first lateral neighbors , i.e. , @xmath177 . in a similar way ,",
    "let us define @xmath178 , the set of peaks of an equipotential line that are also characterized by positive fluctuations .",
    "a point @xmath179 when @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "finally , let us define @xmath182 as the fraction of the number of points @xmath183 that also satisfy @xmath184 .",
    "it is possible to show that a relation @xmath185 should be valid , where @xmath186 is the average value of @xmath187 that was restricted to points @xmath188 .",
    "this regime identifies the regions for equipotential lines where the small fluctuations quickly disappear and large fluctuations with lower wavelengths prevail when the electric potential grows .",
    "in fact , for equipotential lines that are far from the rough profile , we find that @xmath189 ( for example , the main peaks in figure [ figure1 ] ( a ) for @xmath190 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding global roughness can be written as    @xmath191    additionally , @xmath25 should depend on @xmath192 as :    @xmath193    so that @xmath194 for equipotential lines that are far from the cathode .",
    "this result is observed in figure [ skew ] ( a ) , where @xmath195 as @xmath167 for @xmath196 .",
    "it is worth noting that such behavior is observed in the large roughness limit ( @xmath197 ) of the conducting profile . in figure",
    "[ skew1 ] , we show that these theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical calculations for the rough conducting profile that were generated for @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "it is clearly observed that in the regime where @xmath200 , the exponent of @xmath201 tends to @xmath202 . in this region",
    ", @xmath132 quickly grows for @xmath203 immediately before the inflexion point ( see figure [ skew ] ( a ) ) .     and @xmath204 .",
    "in the inset , we show a magnified region where the scale relation @xmath205 holds.,width=283 ]    if we only consider the cases where the equipotential lines have @xmath206 , the predictions by eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 m ] ) and ( [ eq4n ] ) fail for @xmath207 , i.e. , in the case of smooth surfaces , where the values of the skewness of distant equipotential lines are @xmath208 as @xmath209 ( for example , see figure [ skew ] ( a ) for @xmath95 ) . in that case",
    ", @xmath132 grows slowly before the inflexion point mainly because of the variations of fluctuations , which are associated to longer wavelengths ( see figure [ figure1 ] ( b ) ) . for @xmath207 , the region before the inflection point corresponds to @xmath210 .",
    "however , figure [ skew1 ] shows that , in this region , the absolute value of the exponent of @xmath182 is greater than @xmath211 .",
    "this result explains the rapid disappearance of roughness with lower wavelengths ( which do not corresponds to pronounced peaks ) .",
    "then , we encounter another regime with the absolute value of the exponent of @xmath182 less than @xmath211 , which explains the limit @xmath212 in figure [ skew ] ( a ) for @xmath207 .",
    "in this paper , we study the behavior of the height distributions of the equipotential lines and focus the behavior of their skewness and kurtosis .",
    "we used rough profiles that were grown following a competitive model with kpz components , which show opposite signals of @xmath18 .",
    "our results show a non - trivial behavior of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "we conducted our investigation for profiles with a lateral extension @xmath213 grown until a time @xmath214 , which considerably reduces ( but not eliminate ) the presence of finite time effects for any @xmath215 0.83 .",
    "for all kpz profiles with @xmath104 , an almost invariant behavior of @xmath25 and @xmath26 on @xmath41 was found .",
    "the same behavior occurs to families for which @xmath109 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the height distribution of the equipotential lines have an invariant behavior with respect to @xmath41 , although they are different from the previous families with @xmath104 . for families with @xmath216 ,",
    "our results show a third distinct behavior for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these results suggest that the electric potential variation can identify the signal of @xmath18 , which provides the signal of the skewness of the rough conducting profile .",
    "however , the height distribution statistics of equipotential lines far from the conducting profile were shown as being notably different .    the particular behavior of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as a function of @xmath41 when @xmath217 motivated the comparison of these parameters with the corresponding ones that were obtained for substrates that are characterized by identical ew values of growth exponents .",
    "this comparison was conducted considering the equipotential lines of rough profiles : ( i ) which are defined by @xmath102 , ( ii ) for the case of a family model , and ( iii ) at the time in the competitive model ( for @xmath1=0.80 and @xmath1=0.825 ) where the effective growth exponent nearly @xmath218 .",
    "the results show similar behaviors for @xmath102 and the family model but clearly different results when the effective growth exponent is nearly @xmath218 . at these values of @xmath38 , where thin - film technology arises , the misinterpretations of small differences in @xmath160 (",
    "if experimentally reliable ) compared with @xmath169 can significantly affect the design of the electrical devices .",
    "finally , our results can provide new insights for cases where the rough morphologies are an important tool to construct devices where electrical properties play a fundamental role .",
    "for example in the design of devices for the flexible stacked resistive random access memory ( rram ) applications the rough surface leads to a local electric field enhancement which accelerates the oxygen ion back - drift by the external positive bias ( reset process ) @xcite .",
    "radio - frequency absorption and electric field enhancements due to surface roughness are also subjects of theoretical research @xcite",
    ". however , there are situations where high roughness is an important tool , such as when the deposited surface is combined with metallic and nonmetallic materials . in that case , understanding the evolution of the surface morphology and the electric potential distribution along an irregular shape during electrodeposition phenomena is greatly significant @xcite .",
    "moreover , in our viewpoint , the current study has called the attention to interesting characteristics that help one more systematically interpret of images from probe microscopies , such as the electrostatic force microscopy . in that case",
    ", the tip must be maintained far enough from the rough surface to avoid unwanted short - range interactions ( which may result from van der waals forces ) and close enough to not loose important morphologic information about the real profile .",
