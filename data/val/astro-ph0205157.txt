    "bg geminorum was discovered by @xcite and @xcite as a possible rv tau star with an uncertain period of @xmath7 60 days . with a photographic magnitude of @xmath7 14 ,",
    "the star languished in the general catalog of variable stars @xcite until 1992 , when @xcite discovered an ellipsoidal variation with an optical amplitude of @xmath7 0.5 mag and a period of 91.645 days .",
    "light curves derived from optical spectrophotometry reveal a deep primary eclipse at short wavelengths , @xmath8 4400  , and a shallow secondary eclipse at longer wavelengths .",
    "the ellipsoidal light curve and the radial velocity curve of the k0 i secondary star indicate a semi - detached binary , where the k0 star transfers material into an accretion disk around an unseen primary star .",
    "the primary star is either an early b - type star or a black hole @xcite .    this paper reports new optical and spectroscopic observations of bg gem .",
    "these data yield an orbit for h@xmath0 emission from the disk . coupled with an improved ephemeris and orbit for the k0 secondary",
    ", this result indicates a mass ratio , @xmath9 = 0.22 @xmath3 0.07 , where @xmath10 is the mass of the primary star and @xmath11 is the mass of the secondary star .",
    "this result is consistent with the @xmath12 0.1 derived from the optical light curve .",
    "the observations also provide additional information on the structure of the disk . a significant increase in mg",
    "i absorption at secondary minimum shows that the outer part of the disk is cool , with @xmath13 4000 k at @xmath14 0.26 au from the primary star . despite the detection of weak he  i emission lines , the nature of the central ionizing source is uncertain .",
    "the absolute h  i and he  i line fluxes appear to rule out a b - type primary star as the ionizing source and may indicate radiation from a boundary layer at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "we begin with a summary of the observations in  2 , continue with the analysis in  3 , and conclude with a brief discussion in  4 .",
    "student observers acquired optical photometry of bg gem with standard vr@xmath15i@xmath15 filters and a photometrics pm512 camera mounted on the wellesley college 0.6-m sawyer telescope . @xcite",
    "describe the instrument and the data reduction . because wellesley is not a photometric site , we derive photometry of bg gem relative to two comparison stars .",
    "the relative photometry has 1@xmath16 probable errors of @xmath30.011 mag at v , @xmath30.014 mag at r@xmath15 , and @xmath30.011 mag at i@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "table 1 lists new relative photometry of bg gem and a comparison star as a function of time ( the heliocentric julian date , jd ) and photometric phase ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these new data yield an improved ephemeris for primary minimum and photometric phase , @xmath18    p. berlind , m. calkins , and several other observers acquired low resolution optical spectra of bg gem with fast , a high throughput , slit spectrograph mounted at the fred l. whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope on mount hopkins , arizona @xcite .",
    "they used a 300 g mm@xmath4 grating blazed at 4750  , a 3  slit , and a thinned loral 512 @xmath19 2688 ccd .",
    "these spectra cover 38007500   at a resolution of 6  .",
    "we wavelength - calibrate the spectra in noao iraf . after trimming the ccd frames at each end of the slit , we correct for the bias level , flat - field each frame , apply an illumination correction , and derive a full wavelength solution from calibration lamps acquired immediately after each exposure . the wavelength solution for each frame has a probable error of @xmath30.5   or better . to construct final 1-d spectra ,",
    "we extract object and sky spectra using the optimal extraction algorithm apextract within iraf .",
    "most of the resulting spectra have moderate signal - to - noise , s / n @xmath20 30 per pixel .",
    "we derive radial velocities from the strong absorption and emission lines on fast spectra . for absorption line velocities ,",
    "we cross - correlate the fast spectra against the best - exposed spectrum , where the velocity is set by cross - correlation against standard stars with known velocities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to avoid contamination from the hot primary , we restrict the cross - correlation to @xmath2150006800 .",
    "we measure emission line velocities from cross - correlations with an emission - line template , as described by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the velocity of h@xmath0 as the emission line velocity , because h@xmath22 may be blended with [ n  ii ] emission on our low resolution spectra .",

    "the coadded spectra suggest a weak broad pedestal of h@xmath22 and h@xmath0 emission with a velocity width of @xmath7 4000 km s@xmath4 . at low resolution ,",
    "these features are difficult to disentangle from numerous k - type absorption features and may not be real .",
    "the absorption line radial velocities show clear evidence for orbital motion correlated with the photometric phase ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we analyze these observations using the @xcite fourier transform algorithm ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the best spectroscopic period , @xmath32 days , agrees with the photometric period .",
    "a circular orbit with @xmath33 from equation ( 1 ) fits the orbit well .",
    "this solution has an orbital semi - amplitude , @xmath34 , and a fractional semi - major axis , @xmath35 au . spectroscopic conjunctions occur 0.69 days prior to photometric minima , with    @xmath36    the phase difference between primary eclipses and spectroscopic conjunctions has a significance of 1@xmath16 .",

    "we derive lucy - sweeney probabilities of @xmath47 = 3.6% for the fourier solution and @xmath47 = 4.9% for the configuration space solution ; @xmath48 5% implies the eccentricity is non - zero with 95% confidence .",
    "radial velocity measurements using higher resolution spectra could resolve this ambiguity . in this paper , we adopt the circular solution with the parameters quoted above .",
    "if the k0  i secondary has negligible mass and sin @xmath38 = 1 , these results place a lower limit on the mass of the primary , @xmath49 3.5 .",
    "radial velocities of the h@xmath0 emission line also vary with photometric phase ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the line variations during primary minimum are consistent with the eclipse of a rapidly rotating disk , where the blue - shifted half of the disk is eclipsed first during ingress and is revealed first during egress .",
    "the velocity variations of h@xmath0 outside primary minimum provide a direct estimate of the mass ratio .",
    "the best - fitting circular orbit to data with @xmath17 = 0.050.95 has an orbital semi - amplitude , @xmath2 = @xmath50 km s@xmath4 and a fractional semi - major axis , @xmath51 sin",
    "@xmath38 = @xmath52 .",
    "the orbital conjunction derived from the h@xmath0 velocities , conj(h@xmath0 ) = jd 2451009.65 @xmath3 4.6 , is 2.91 days prior to primary eclipse and is 2.63 days prior to the spectroscopic conjunction defined by the absorption line velocities .",
    "together with the absorption line orbit , these results indicate that the h@xmath0 line provides a reasonable first estimate for the orbit of the disk surrounding the primary star .",
    "if the orbital semi - amplitude of the unseen primary is 16.0 km s@xmath4 , the mass ratio is @xmath5 . for sin",
    "@xmath38 @xmath53 1 , the component masses are then @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath55 .",
    "these results are consistent with the @xmath12 0.1 derived from the ellipsoidal light curve @xcite .",
    "most of the low excitation absorption lines in bg gem spectra provide a good measure of the spectral type for the k - type secondary star @xcite .",
    "the ba  i blend at 6495    is constant with photometric phase ( figure 3 ) .",
    "absorption lines at shorter wavelengths vary consistently with photometric phase ( figure 3 ; benson et al .",
    "all lines grow stronger at @xmath17 = 0 , when the k - type star eclipses light from the primary .",
    "the absorption line strengths at primary minimum are consistent with a k0 i spectral type for the secondary star @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths of several absorption lines rise at @xmath57 0.5 , when the disk surrounding the primary eclipses the secondary star .",
    "the na  i , mg  i , and several other low ionization lines are as strong at secondary minimum as at primary minimum ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the disk surrounding the primary star is the only possible source of this extra absorption .",
    "the duration of the second maximum in mg i line strength yields a reliable estimate for the sum of the radius of the k0 i secondary and the radius of the region that produces mg  i absorption , @xmath58 @xmath53 ( 0.60 @xmath3 0.03 ) a ; this yields @xmath59 0.44 au for @xmath60 = 0.73 au . with @xmath61 0.18 au @xcite ,",

    "this radius is larger than the @xmath63 0.22 au derived from the emission line eclipses @xcite .",
    "the mg  i line strength appears to drop rapidly at @xmath17 = 0.5 , when our line - of - sight passes through the center of the primary and the surrounding accretion disk .",
    "the line strength recovers at @xmath17 = 0.51 and then falls gradually as the system approaches orbital quadrature .",
    "although our phase coverage at @xmath17 = 0.5 is not superb , this behavior repeats over several eclipses .    we propose a simple explanation for the behavior of mg  i absorption at @xmath17 = 0.450.55 . because mg  i has an ionization potential of 7.6 ev , mg is ionized to mg  ii in the inner region of the disk that produces h@xmath22 emission .",
    "if the outer part of the disk is cool , t @xmath7 4000 k , most mg atoms are neutral and can absorb radiation from the k0 i secondary .",
    "we see this absorption at secondary minima when the k0 star lies behind the disk .",
    "the drop in mg  i absorption at @xmath17 = 0.5 implies a ring geometry for mg i atoms .",
    "the central hole of the ring , where magnesium is mg  ii , yields a longer path length through the edge of the ring than through the center .    if the outer disk is heated by the central star , the mg i absorption places some useful limits on the temperature of the central star . in most heating models ,",

    "with @xmath67 4000 k at @xmath14 0.26 au , the limits on the temperature of the 45 @xmath55 main sequence star are reasonable , @xmath68 12,000  k to 20,000  k.      we detect modest he  i emission on coadded spectra of bg gem . the @xmath235876 line is blended with strong na  i d absorption lines and is difficult to measure accurately .",
    "the @xmath234471 line has an equivalent width of @xmath7 0.5   at orbital quadratures and @xmath7 1   at @xmath17 = 0.5 .",
