    "the last two decades have witnessed a revival in the study of strongly correlated electron systems . a large variety of transition metal compounds , rare earth and actinide based materials have been synthesized .",
    "strong correlation effects are also seen in organic metals , and carbon based compounds such as bucky balls and carbon nanotubes .",
    "these systems display a wide range of physical properties such as high  temperature superconductivity , heavy  fermion behavior , and colossal magnetoresistance to name a few @xcite .",
    "strong correlation effects are the result of competing interactions .",
    "they often produce at low temperatures several thermodynamic phases which are very close in free energy , resulting in complex phase diagrams . as a result of these competing tendencies , strongly  correlated electron systems are very sensitive to small changes in external parameters , i.e. pressure , temperature , composition , stress .",

    "a solid is viewed as a regular array of atoms where each atom binds an integer number of electrons .",
    "these atoms carry spin and orbital quantum numbers giving rise to a natural spin and orbital degeneracy .",
    "transport occurs via activation , namely the creation of vacancies and doubly occupied sites .",
    "atomic physics calculations together with perturbation theory around the atomic limit allows us to derive accurate spin ",
    ". the one  electron spectrum of the mott insulators is composed of atomic excitations which are broadened to form bands that have no single  particle character , known as hubbard bands . in large number of compounds spin and orbital degrees of freedom order at low temperatures breaking spin rotation and spatial symmetries .",
    "however , when quantum fluctuations are strong enough to prevent the ordering , possible new forms of quantum mechanical ground states may emerge@xcite .",
    "these two limits , well separated atoms , and well overlapping bands , are by now well understood and form the basis of the  standard model  of solid  state physics .",
    "one of the frontiers in strongly correlated electron physics problem is the description of the electronic structure of solids away from these limits .",
    "the challenge is to develop new concepts and new computational methods capable to describing situations where both itineracy and localization are simultaneously important .",

    "it can be thought of as an extension of the band  structure formalism that takes into account the electron ",
    "electron interactions .",

    "( _ a ) selection of cluster variables : _ the first step in a mean  field approach to a physical problem , is a selection of a finite set of relevant variables .",

    "the creation and annihilation operators of the new basis are related to the operators of the old basis by @xmath21 and the operators that contain the `` local '' information that we want to focus our attention on are @xmath22 , i.e.  the operators of the cluster at the origin .",

    "note that we do not require that the wave  function basis is orthogonal , and the nonorthogonality is summarized in an overlap matrix @xmath23 .",

    "the low  temperature phase diagram of simple hamiltonians treated within dmft has several distinct phases , and is fairly complex . even the simplest , bare  bones hamiltonian ( one  band hubbard model with partial frustration ) has at least a metallic antiferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic insulating phase in addition to a paramagnetic metal phase and the antiferromagnetic insulating phase .",
    "the understanding of this model required several years of research efforts by several groups @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . in this section",
    "we highlight some of the insights obtained , to motivate the need for extending the dmft method to incorporate realistic aspects of the electronic structure .",
    "the phase diagram@xcite shown in fig [ fig5 ] shares some similarities with the phase diagram of vanadium oxide .",
    "this observation leads rozenberg et .",
    "al.@xcite to suggest several optical experiments which have confirmed some qualitative predictions of dmft .",
    "these and other successful predictions of dmft applied to simple model of correlated electrons are described in this section to motivate the applications of this technique in a more realistic setting .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the main lesson drawn from the qualitative similarity in the low  temperature region between the dmft phase diagram of one of the simplest models of correlated electron systems and that of some real oxides , is the ability of the dmft method to capture multiplicity of possible ordered states .",
    "the detailed nature of these phases and the character of the transitions between them depend on many details of the hamiltonian describing the specific crystal structure and chemistry of the compound . to approach this problem realistic versions of dmft",
    "have been constructed and are being developed@xcite .",
    "strong dependence of the low  temperature phases and of the low  temperature physical properties of each material on its crystal structure and chemical composition should be contrasted with the remarkable degree of universality that is predicted to occur at higher temperatures .",
    "all that is required to produce the high  temperature features of the dmft phase diagram is a large degree of magnetic frustration to suppress the long  range order and to allow for a localized phase with a large entropy content . in systems without magnetic frustration , the onset of magnetism or other forms of order preempts us from accessing this strongly correlated regime .",
    "the origin of the magnetic frustration is crucial for understanding the low  temperature part of the phase diagram , with its myriad of ordered phases , but is rather irrelevant in the high  temperature regime , where thermal fluctuations average all various configurations leading to a more universal description which is captured by a relatively local approach such as dmft in its single site or in its clusters versions . in systems such as titanates and vanadium oxides ,",
    "the origin of frustration arises from the orbital degeneracy which is unique to those materials . in nickel selenide sulfide mixtures ,",
    "the crystal structure is such that a sizeable ring exchange term competes with the nearest ",
    "neighbor superexchange interaction resulting in a reduced neel temperature .",
    "still , these systems display very similar phenomena around the mott transition endpoint .",
    "contrast between highly  universal behavior at high temperature and the dependence of low  temperature properties on additional parameters in the hamiltonian , was discussed@xcite in connection with the comparison of the physical properties of the vanadium oxide and the nickel selenide sulfide mixtures .",
    "the phase diagram of the two  dimensional organic compound @xmath68 bedttf @xcite , where the frustration originates in its underlying chiral triangular lattice of dimers , strengthen the validity of this point of view .",
    "indeed many of the high  temperature physical properties of this have been accounted for by the dmft studies of mckenzie and merino @xcite .    to summarize , since magnetic frustration and competition of kinetic and interaction energy are all that is required for obtaining the high  temperature part of the `` canonical '' phase diagram of a correlated electron system .",
    "at low temperatures between two values of u , @xmath69 and @xmath70 two dynamical mean field solutions are possible .",
    "the transition between the localized and extended regime as a function of @xmath71 takes place via a first ",
    "order transition @xcite@xcite , this is faithfully reproduced by the simplest model containing these ingredients treated within dmft .",
    "the phase diagram@xcite displays two crossover lines .",
    "the dotted line in fig 1 is a coherence incoherence crossover ( i.e. the continuation of the @xmath72 line where metallicity is lost ) .",
    "the shaded area is a continuation of the @xmath69 line , where the temperature becomes comparable with the gap .",
    "both were observed in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 system @xcite .",
    "further justification for this point of view , and a refined description of the localization delocalization transition around the mott transition endpoint was achieved by the development of a landau like description @xcite .",
    "mapping onto the anderson impurity model offers an intuitive picture of both metallic states and mott insulating states .",
    "a correlated metal is described locally as the anderson impurity model in a metallic bath : the kondo effect gives rise to strongly renormalized quasiparticles when the interactions are strong , and to a broad band when the interactions are weak .",
    "the mott insulator is locally described as the anderson impurity model in an insulating bath .",
    "the charge degrees of freedom are gapped , but the spin degrees of freedom are not quenched ; they dominate the low  energy physics .",
    "when there is one electron per site , the mott transition takes place as one goes from the first regime to the second by increasing the strength of the interaction @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "a sketch of the evolution of the spectral function @xmath76 of the half  filled hubbard model is described in figure ( [ spectralu ] ) . for interactions @xmath75 close but smaller than the critical @xmath72 the one ",
    "electron spectral function of the hubbard model in the strongly correlated metallic region contains both atomic features ( i.e. hubbard bands ) and quasiparticle features in its spectra @xcite .",
    "this may be understood intuitively from the anderson ",
    "hamman path ",
    "integral representation . in the regime of strong correlations , paths that are nearly constant in imaginary time , as well as those that fluctuate strongly ,",
    "have substantial weight in the path integral .",
    "the former give rise to the hubbard bands , while the latter ones are responsible for the low ",
    "frequency kondo resonance .",
    "two features in these spectra are surprpizing .",
    "first , the narrow central peak before the mott transition , resulting from quasiparticle states formed in the background of the coherent kondo tunneling of the local spin fluctuations .",
    "second , atomic physics leaves a signature on the one  particle spectral properties in the form of well  formed hubbard bands at higher frequency , in the strongly  correlated metallic state .    as the transition at zero temperature",
    "is approached , there is a substantial transfer of spectral weight from the low  lying quasiparticles to the hubbard bands .",
    "the mott transition at zero temperature takes place at a critical value of @xmath75 , denoted by @xmath72 where the integrated spectral weight at low frequency vanishes , as shown in figure [ spectralu ] .",
    "this results in a mott transition point where the quasiparticle mass diverges , but a discontinuous gap opens in the quasiparticle spectra@xcite .",
    "these results are in agreement with the early work of fujimori _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who arrived at essentially the same picture on the basis of experiment .",
    "it is worth remarking that the spectral function in the strongly correlated metallic region is better regarded as composed of three components : hubbard bands centered at @xmath77 , a low  energy quasiparticle peak with a height of order unity and a total intensity proportional to @xmath78 distributed over an energy range @xmath79 , and an incoherent background connecting the high energy to the low  energy region .",
    "the last feature ensures that there is no real gap between the quasiparticle features and the hubbard bands , as long as one stays in the metallic regime .",
    "figure [ resist ] describes the anomalous resistivities near these crossover regions .",
    "notice the anomalously large metallic resistivity which is typical of many oxides @xcite . while the curves in this figure far exceed the ioffe ",
    "regel limit ( using estimates of @xmath80 from t=0 calculations ) there is no violation of any physical principle . at low temperatures , a @xmath55 space based fermi ",
    "theory description works but in this regime the resistivity is low ( below the ioffe ",
    "regel limit ) .",
    "above certain temperature the resistivity exceeds the ioffe  regel limit but",
    "then quasiparticle description becomes inadequate .",
    "there is no breakdown or singularities in our formalism , the spectral functions remain smooth , ( above the mott ",
    "transition endpoint ) , only the physical picture changes . at high temperatures we have an incoherent regime to which the ioffe  regel criteria does not apply , because there are no long  lived excitations with well  defined crystal momentum in the spectra .",
    "the electron is strongly scattered off orbitals and spin fluctuations , and is better described in real space . in this regime , there is no simple description in terms of  @xmath55 space elementary excitations , but one can construct a simple description and perform quantitative calculations if one adopts the spectral function as a basic object in terms of which one formulates the theory .",
    "only the anomalously large magnitude of the resistivity ( which follows from the green function which has branch cuts rather than well  defined poles ) , is universal as can be seen by comparison of the detailed temperature dependence at half filling ( as in fig [ resist ] ) and away from half filling as in figures [ resist3 ] and [ resist2 ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the transport in the high  temperature incoherent regime depends on whether the system is at integer filling or doped , as can be shown numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite in the example of the doped mott insulator .",
    "the low  temperature and the high  temperature anomalously large resistivities also occur in strongly coupled electron ",
    "phonon systems , as discussed earlier@xcite .",
    "another manifestation of the same physics is the anomalous transfer of spectral weight which is observed in the one  electron and in the optical spectra of correlated systems as parameters such as doping or pressure are varied .",
    "this surprising aspect of strong  correlation physics was noted and emphasized by many authors@xcite .",
    "transfer of spectral weight can also take place as a function of temperature .",
    "for example the  kinetic energy  which appears in the low",
    " energy optical sum rule can have sizeable temperature dependence , an effect that was discovered experimentally by @xcite and  explained theoretically by dmft  calculations @xcite    once more , thinking about this problem in terms of well  defined quasiparticles is not useful .",
    "it is more fruitful to formulate the problem in terms of spectral functions describing on the same footing coherent and incoherent excitations .",
    "the relative weights of these components in the spectra evolves smoothly with temperature and leads to sizeable variations in the integrated optical intensity .",
    "the evolution of the spectral function near the temperature driven mott transition is shown in figure [ spectralt ] .",
    "the physics of strongly correlated materials in a wide range of parameters can not be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations .",
