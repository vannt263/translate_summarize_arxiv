    "dielectrophoresis and electrorotation ( er ) offer a unique capability of monitoring the dielectric properties of dispersions of colloids and biological cells . under the action of external fields , these particles exhibit rich fluid - dynamic behaviors as well as various dielectric responses .",
    "it is of importance to investigate their frequency - dependent responses to ac electric fields , which yields valuable information on the structural ( maxwell - wagner ) polarization effects @xcite .",
    "the polarization is characterized by a variety of characteristic frequency - dependent changes known as the dielectric dispersion . in particular , for the @xmath0-dispersion ( also called the maxwell - wagner dispersion , ranging from khz to mhz ) , it may suffice to focus on the induced dipole moments of the particles . in this work",
    ", we will analyze the @xmath0-dispersion based on the spectral representation theory .    in the last two decades",
    ", various experimental tools have been developed to analyze the polarization of biological cells - dielectric spectroscopy @xcite , dielectrophoresis @xcite and er @xcite techniques . among these techniques ,",
    "conventional dielectrophoresis and er are usually applied to analyze the frequency dependence of translations and rotations of individual cells in an inhomogeneous and rotating electric field , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , one is able to monitor the cell movements by using automated video analysis @xcite as well as light scattering methods @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the general cause of er is the existence of a phase difference between the field - induced dipole moment and the external rotating field , resulting in a desired torque which causes the cells to rotate .    in the dilute limit ,",
    "the er of individual cell can be predicted by ignoring the mutual interaction between the cells .",
    "however , the cells may aggregate under the influence of the external field . in this case the brownian motion can be neglected , and the cell system becomes non - dilute even though it is initially dilute . as an initial model , we have recently studied the er of two approaching spherical particles in the presence of a rotating electric field @xcite .",
    "we showed that when the two particles approach and finally touch , the mutual polarization interaction between the particles leads to a change in the dipole moment of individual particles and hence the er spectrum , as compared to that of isolated particles , via the multiple image method @xcite .    in this work , we consider further the effects of cell shape on the er spectrum .",
    "in fact , a cell may readily deviate from a perfect spherical shape due to many reasons , e.g. , under a hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "in addition to a prolate spheroidal shape @xcite , there exist cells of oblate spheroidal shape , such as human erythrocytes .",
    "regarding the spectral representation approach @xcite , it is a rigorous mathematical formalism of the effective dielectric constant of a two - phase composite material .",
    "also , the approach was extended to deal with a three - phase material @xcite .",
    "the spectral approach offers the advantage of the separation of material parameters ( namely the dielectric constant and conductivity ) from the cell structure information , thus simplifying the study . from this approach",
    ", one can readily derive the dielectric dispersion spectrum , with the dispersion strength as well as the characteristic frequency being explicitly expressed in terms of the structure parameters and the materials parameters of the cell suspension @xcite . in the present work , the analytic expression for the characteristic frequency",
    "is derived with the aid of the spectral representation approach , thus simplifying the fitting of experimental data .",
    "we show good agreement with experimental data on human erythrocytes @xcite .",
    "consider a suspension of spheroidal particles of complex dielectric constant @xmath1 coated with a shell of @xmath2 dispersed in a host medium of @xmath3 , where = + /i2f with @xmath4 being the frequency of the applied field @xmath5 .",
    "the depolarization factors of the spheroidal particles is described by a sum rule l_z+2l_xy=1 where @xmath6 and @xmath7(@xmath8 ) are the depolarization factors along the @xmath9- and @xmath10- ( or @xmath11- ) axes of the oblate spheroidal particle , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 just indicates sphere , while @xmath13 disk .",
    "the phenomenon of er is based on the interaction between a rotating electric field @xmath14 and the induced dipole moment @xmath15 .",
    "the dipole moment of the particle arises from the induced charges that accumulate at the interface of the particle . in",
    "circularly polarized fields , the axis of lowest polarizability , namely @xmath16axis of the present particle , should be oriented perpendicular to the plane of field rotation @xcite .",
    "the angle between @xmath15 and @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is angular velocity of the rotating electric field .",
    "the torque acting on the particle is given by the vector cross product between the electric field and the dipole moment , so that only the imaginary part of the dipole moment contributes to the er response . in the steady state , the frequency - dependent rotation speed @xmath20 , which results from the balance between the torque and the viscous drag , is given by @xmath21 , \\nonumber \\\\    & = & -f(\\ep_2 , e,\\eta)im[\\t{b}_{x}]=-f(\\ep_2 , e,\\eta)im[\\t{b}_{y}]\\equiv   -f(\\ep_2 , e,\\eta)im[\\t{b}_{xy } ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath22 $ ] indicates taking the imaginary parts of @xmath23 $ ] , the angular brackets denote a time average , and @xmath24 is a coefficient which is proportional to the square of magnitude of field @xmath25 , but being inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity @xmath26 of the host medium . for spherical cells , @xmath27 . regarding @xmath26 ,",
    "spin friction expression suffices for spherical particle .",
    "however , for spheroidal particles or many particles interacting in a suspension , we must consider the more complicated suspension hydrodynamics . since the angular velocity of the rotating field is much greater than the electrorotation angular velocity , i.e. , @xmath28 , the time averages are just equal to 1/2 . for a single coated spheroidal particle ,",
    "the dipole factor @xmath29 is given by @xcite _",
    "xy= where @xmath11 is the volume ratio of the core to the whole coated spheroid .",
    "we are now in a position to represent @xmath30 in the spectral representation . in what follows",
    ", we will show that from the spectral representation , we can obtain the analytic expression for the characteristic frequency at which the maximum er velocity occurs .",
    "let @xmath31 , and assume @xmath32 , we obtain _ xy = np+ [ bxy ] where @xmath33 denotes the nonresonant part @xcite which vanishes in the limit of unshelled spheroidal cells . in eq.([bxy ] ) , the various quantities are given by @xmath34\\}}{x+(1-l_{xy } )   l_{xy}(1-x)^2(1-y)},\\nonumber\\\\ f_1&=&\\frac{-x^2y}{3[x+(1-l_{xy})l_{xy}(1-x)^2(1-y)]^2},\\nonumber\\\\ np&=&\\frac{[l_{xy}(1-x)+x](1-x)(1-y)}{3[-x-(1-l_{xy } )   l_{xy}(1-x)^2(1-y)]}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that we have assumed @xmath10 to be a real number , that is , @xmath35 , which will be justified below .",
    "after substituting @xmath36 into eq.([bxy ] ) , we rewrite @xmath37 after simple manipulations _ xy=(np+)+ with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where the dispersion magnitude and characteristic frequency admit respectively @xmath40 @xmath41",
    "in fig.1(a)-(c ) , the dependence of the pole , characteristic frequency and dispersion magnitude on the parameter @xmath10 are investigated for different particle shape . for clarity",
    ", we set @xmath42 from now on .",
    "it is evident that both @xmath43 and @xmath44 decreases monotonically as @xmath10 increases ; larger depolarization factor leads to smaller @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , for increasing @xmath10 , @xmath45 increases concomitantly ; also , @xmath45 increases while @xmath46 increases .    in fig.1(d)-(f ) , we investigate the dependence of the pole , characteristic frequency and dispersion magnitude on @xmath10 for different shell thickness . for @xmath47 ,",
    "namely without shell , @xmath48 always .",
    "increasing @xmath10 leads to decreasing @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "it is evident that thicker shell yields larger pole or @xmath44 as @xmath49 , but smaller as @xmath50 . in the dispersion magnitude plot , @xmath45 is constant for the uncoated particles . in the case of coated particles , increasing @xmath10 yields increasing @xmath45 ; moreover , larger @xmath9 , smaller @xmath45 .    in fig.2 , the dependence of material parameters ( namely , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) on @xmath44 and @xmath45 is discussed .",
    "@xmath44 is weakly dependent on @xmath51 , but strongly dependent on @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "smaller @xmath55 ( or @xmath53 ) , larger @xmath44 .",
    "however , larger @xmath54 , larger @xmath44 . on the other hand , @xmath45 is weakly dependent on @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "also , it is evident that @xmath53 and @xmath54 play no role in @xmath45 , as eq.([dep ] ) actually shows .",
    "note all curves in fig.2(g ) and ( h ) are respectively overlapped . in other words , this predicts that @xmath53 and @xmath54 plays no role in the peak value of the angular velocity ( see fig.4 ) .    in fig.3 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath46 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 on @xmath56 $ ] are investigated , respectively .",
    "there is always a peak , the location of which is just the characteristic frequency @xmath44 . as @xmath46 ( or @xmath10 ) increases , @xmath44 becomes red - shift , while the corresponding peak value increases as well .",
    "however , a larger @xmath9 yields smaller peak value , while @xmath44 is changed weakly .    in fig.4",
    ", we discuss the dependence of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 on @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath51 effect is small so that it can be neglected .",
    "smaller @xmath55 leads to larger @xmath44 ; at the same time , increasing peak value appears .",
    "increasing @xmath53 yields decreasing @xmath44 , and the related peak value is unchanged . for increasing @xmath54 ,",
    "@xmath44 increases concomitantly , but the peak value remains unchanged as well .    in fig.5",
    ", the experimental data is extracted from an experiment on human erythrocytes @xcite .",
    "obviously , there is a good agreement between theory and experiment . during this fitting ,",
    "we model the cell as oblate spheroid ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "in the present work , we have discussed the effect of oblate spheroidal particle shape on the er spectrum . in reality , there exist many cells in the form of oblate spheroid , such as human erythrocytes @xcite .",
    "however , there exist only a few theories to discuss the er spectrum of such cells ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our theory is advantageous in that the characteristic frequency at which the maximum rotational velocity occurs , is derived analytically , which simplifies the fitting of experimental data .",
    "we have assumed @xmath10 , namely the ratio of the shell to host dielectric constant , to be a real and positive number .",
    "in fact , its imaginary part is indeed small .",
    "if we had retained the imaginary part of @xmath10 , two peaks would appear , and the conductivity - dominated peak would have occurred at substantially lower frequency .",
    "therefore , the neglect of the imaginary part of @xmath10 is to drop the lower frequency peak .",
    "moreover , according to our calculations , there are two ( degenerate ) sub - dominant poles associated with @xmath30 in the spectral representation .",
    "thus , in the present work , only one capacitance - dominated peak has been shown .    in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we developed simple equations to describe the er of particles in a suspension from the spectral representation , and obtained a good fitting on a coated - bead er assay by using the coated spherical model . in this work , an extension to oblate",
    "spheroidal case has been made .",
    "our theory serves as a basis which describes the parameter dependence of the polarization and thereby enhances the applicability of various cell models for the analysis of the polarization mechanisms . in this connection , the shell - spheroidal cell model",
    "may readily be extended to multi - shell cell model .",
    "however , we have shown that the multi - shell nature of the cell may have a minor effect on the er spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have considered the isolated cell case , which is a valid assumption for low concentration of cells . however , for a higher concentration of cells , we should consider the mutual interaction between cells .",
    "when the volume fraction of the suspension becomes large , the particles may aggregate in the plane of the rotating applied field , and the mutual interactions between the suspended particles can modify the spin friction , which is a key to determine the angular velocity of er . for er of two particles , we have successfully applied the spectral representation to deal with the dispersion frequency @xcite . however , the determination of the spin friction is still lacking . for two particles , the basic tool is the reflection method @xcite , being analogous to the multiple image method in electrostatics , but being only valid for two particles . for more than two particles ,",
    "we need a first - principles method , e.g. , the green s function ( oseen tensor ) formulation . for a dilute suspension , however , one may adopt the effective medium theories @xcite to capture the effective viscosity of a suspension , hence modifying further the er spectrum .    one may argue that normal erythrocytes may deviate from an oblate spheroidal shape . for cells of non - conventional shapes , one may use a first - principles approach @xcite , recently developed to deal with particles of rod shape . as shown in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the derivation from spheroidal model can be small when the cells are rotating with their long axes along the applied field .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a theoretical study of electrorotation based on the spectral representation theory . from the theoretical analysis",
    ", we find that cell shape as well as the coating can change the characteristic frequency . by adjusting the cell shape , dielectric properties and the thickness of the coating , it is possible to obtain good agreement between our theoretical predictions and the experimental data on human erythrocytes suspensions .",
