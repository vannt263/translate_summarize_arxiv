    "the dynamics of whistler wave packets in the inner magnetosphere have been investigated using linear ray tracing for decades @xcite .",
    "these studies are important in understanding the lifetime of trapped energetic electrons in the earth s radiation belts because pitch - angle scattering by electromagnetic whistler waves into the loss - cone can be the dominant loss mechanism@xcite .",
    "the rate of pitch - angle scattering is a sensitive function of the spatial , spectral , and wave - normal distributions of the wave energy density , and therefore mechanisms that control the distribution of wave energy are important .",
    "recently the results of @xcite and @xcite have been extended to demonstrate that , through nonlinear ( nl ) induced scattering by thermal electrons in low-@xmath0 plasmas , quasi - electrostatic lower - hybrid waves can scatter into electromagnetic whistler waves@xcite . in this paper we report on initial efforts to incorporate this nl mechanism into the calculation of the propagation of whistler waves in the plasmasphere .",
    "we find that when the turbulent wave energy density exceeds a threshold , nl scattering can scatter waves that have exhausted their usefulness for pitch - angle scattering back into useful waves capable of further pitch angle scattering .",
    "we suggest a weak turbulence framework for incorporating these effects into ray tracing calculations .",
    "this framework is a natural extension of linear techniques such as ray tracing and quasi - linear diffusion that have been the workhorse of radiation belt physics for decades .",
    "magnetospherically reflecting whistlers ( mrw ) are whistler waves , possibly originating from lightning strikes , whose ray paths in the magnetosphere roughly follow magnetic field lines , reflecting many times between the magnetic poles . waves originating in the ionosphere propagate to higher and higher altitude and the perpendicular component of the wave vector increases@xcite . based on linear theory",
    "there are two important physical effects that limit the degree of influence that mrw are predicted to have on the lifetime of trapped energetic electrons .",
    "first , linear damping of whistler waves depends strongly on the perpendicular wavelength ( increasing as @xmath1 ) .",
    "whistler waves have a significant parallel electric field when the perpendicular wavelength becomes comparable with the electron skin depth .",
    "this parallel electric field is the driving force of linear landau damping ( resonant interactions with electrons ) as well as collisional damping .",
    "also , electron drift @xmath2 energy increases as the square of @xmath3 .",
    "thus as whistler waves propagate from their source region and the perpendicular component of the wave vector becomes larger the linear damping of the waves becomes stronger .",
    "second , the rate of pitch - angle scattering of trapped electrons depends strongly on the perpendicular wavelength .",
    "as the perpendicular wavelengths become shorter than the electron skin depth the whistler wave becomes more electrostatic in nature ( more lower - hybrid like ) and thus the magnetic component ( which pitch - angle scatters through the lorentz force , @xmath4 ) is reduced . in this article",
    "we will demonstrate that when the energy density of whistler waves is large enough , nl induced scattering can return a portion of short - wavelength quasi - electrostatic lower - hybrid waves back into long - wavelength electromagnetic whistler waves which are less damped and more effective at pitch - angle scattering .",
    "the scattered waves ( with smaller @xmath3 ) have only a slightly lower frequency than the original whistler waves , but the direction of @xmath5 and their trajectory through the magnetosphere can be dramatically altered @xcite .",
    "a portion of the scattered waves can be returned back to the ionosphere , and some of these waves will retrace the original ray paths back to the magnetosphere .",
    "these scattered waves are then able to efficiently pitch - angle scatter relativistic electrons once again . through multiple nl scatterings in the magnetosphere and reflections in the ionosphere a cavity containing turbulent whistler waves may be formed that is more long - lived than would be predicted without nl scattering , because the effective @xmath3 and thus linear damping rate is reduced .    in section [ sec : raytracing ] we review the dynamics of whistler wave packets without nl scattering from the ionosphere into the magnetosphere and describe our assumptions in characterizing these trajectories . in section [ sec : theory ] , we describe how we include the effects of nl induced scattering into the dynamics of whistler wave packets . in section [ sec : cavity ] we describe how a long - lived wave energy cavity may be formed due to induced nl scattering and describe some of the basic properties of this cavity . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the role that this newly postulated wave cavity may play in radiation belt physics and outline future efforts to improve our understanding of the properties of the wave cavity .",

    "since the region of interest ( lower magnetosphere ) is a cold plasma ( @xmath35 ev ) landau damping by the thermal part is completely negligible compared to collisional damping .",
    "there sometimes exists a population of suprathermal electrons that can be in resonance with whistler waves@xcite , however this damping is smaller than the collisional damping we consider ( see appendix [ sec : spth ] ) .",

    "we confine ourselves to considering sources in the ionosphere , however , we note that geomagnetic storms and chorus emissions are examples of potential sources from the outer magnetosphere . as for sources in the ionosphere that could generate whistler wave power",
    "there are many candidates , e.g. lightning , vlf transmitters , and velocity ring distributions generated naturally or man made such as in the buaro experiment@xcite or an envisioned future experiment @xcite",
    ".      generally speaking , whistler waves with small wave normal angles propagate from their source region roughly along magnetic field lines , reflecting between the magnetic poles and increasing the value of the perpendicular wave vector .",
    "the obliqueness of the wave allows for cross - field propagation so that wave packets initiated in the ionosphere propagate to higher and higher altitude ( and l - shell ) .",
    "eventually the wave - packet reaches an l - shell greater than the l - shell at which the frequency of the wave matches the lower - hybrid frequency and the radial group velocity reverses . by this time ( a few seconds ) the wave packet has a large perpendicular wave vector and follows the field line more closely .",
    "its radial group velocity is relatively small and the wave packet slowly makes its way back to the lower - hybrid resonant surface .",

    "the model ionosphere / magnetosphere is independent of the azimuthal coordinate and thus the azimuthal component of the wave vector is a constant of motion .",

    "@xmath47 is to be interpreted as the rate of change of the energy contained in waves with wave vector @xmath52 due to all other waves with different frequencies and wave vectors with @xmath53 .",
    "this formula was derived for isothermal , @xmath54 , low-@xmath0 magnetospheric plasmas from the drift kinetic equation for electrons with a fluid response for ions .",
    "it is the electromagnetic generalization of the lower - hybrid induced scattering rate found by @xcite and used in tokamak heating scenarios .",
    "the scattering rate can be physically understood as the landau damping of thermal electrons by the electric field structure created by the beating of two waves .",
    "it is important to point out that the nature of this electric field structure is inherently 3d as can be seen by the presence of the cross product of two perpendicular wave vectors and the parallel components of the wave vectors within the plasma dispersion function .",
    "2d simulations with the simulation plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , or 2d simulations with the magnetic field along one of the simulation axes will miss this fast scattering rate @xcite and will generally see only a slower scalar nonlinearity .",
    "three - dimensional simulations , or 2d simulations where the magnetic field is oblique to the simulation plane are required . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "the importance of this three - dimensionality is that nl scattering allows wave packets with components of the wave vector in a meridional plane to scatter out of the plane as will be shown in the next section .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gnl ] ) was developed in the framework of weak turbulence theory , which considers the nl coupling of linear waves with stochastic uncorrelated phases , so that all waves are solutions to the same linear dispersion relation , and hence the nl induced scattering essentially redistributes energy in @xmath5-space@xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnl ] ) we see that the nl scattering rate is largest when the change in frequency @xmath55 , and since the electron temperature in the plasmasphere is of the order of an electron volt ( which gives an electron thermal speed of about 4@xmath56 cm / s ) then the change in frequency due to a scattering is much smaller than the change in wave vector .",
    "this allows one to view the lines of constant frequency in fig [ fig : disp ] as all of the possible waves that a given wave could scatter into .",
    "for example , if we have a wave that is lower - hybrid like , marked with point ( a ) in the figure , it may scatter into a whistler wave , marked with point ( b ) in the figure .",
    "this has important consequences for the influence of whistler waves on the radiation belts , namely that waves that have already become lower - hybrid like due to the evolution of individual wave packets in a dipole field as predicted by ray tracing , have an opportunity to become whistler waves again .    to gain a detailed understanding of the effects of the nl scattering on the propagation of wave power in the radiation belts a self - consistent solution , either numerical or analytical , to the wave - kinetic equation",
    "is needed .",
    "since this is beyond the scope of this work , we adopt a test wave - packet approach to investigate the effects of nl scattering and thus solutions to eq .",

    "in this section we describe how a cavity in the magnetosphere may be formed when the wave energy density exceeds a threshold , we describe the properties of the cavity , and estimate the influence the formation of the cavity will have on the trajectory and fate of whistler wave packets and on the lifetime of trapped energetic electrons .",
    "we choose a source region in the ionosphere or in the transition region between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere ( see table [ tab : accesscavity ] ) and suppose that the whistler energy flux is nearly monochromatic and isotropic in @xmath5 space .",
    "launching whistler wave packets with the same frequency , from the same location in space , with random directions of the wave vector we can build up a background . by choosing a random direction for the wave vector many packets will immediately be lost by propagation towards the earth s surface , and another percentage of packets will be lost by closely following the magnetic field lines and reaching the earth s surface in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "in addition , some of the packets are trapped by the steep electron density gradient ( closest to the peak in density near 400 km ) , and because of the high density are quickly collisionally damped .",

    "it should be pointed out that this estimated threshold is of the same order of magnitude as the observed amplitude of plasmaspheric hiss @xcite .",
    "thus it can play an important role in such phenomenon as radiation belt slot formation and it can effect theories of the source of plasmaspheric hiss . as we will show in the next section nl scattering can significantly effect the wave propagation .",
    "in the previous sections we computed the accessiblity of whistler waves into the magnetosphere and the threshold in local wave energy density necessary for nl scattering to be important .",
    "now we use ray tracing calculations to estimate the volume of the cavity so that we may estimate the energy necessary to be input to the cavity to achieve sufficient nl scattering .",
    "we launch 1000 wave packets into the magnetosphere and compute the maximum extent in the azimuthal direction ( in units of hours , _",

    "the meridional extent of the cavity increases with the latitude and altitude of the whistler launch point and frequency . to compute the maximum radial extent we find the the maximum radial value achieved by at least 10% of the packets .",

    "we define a whislter wave albedo that we calculate by launching whistler wave packets with random directions for the wave vectors from inside the magnetospheric cavity and integrating the ray tracing equations for a specified time and then comparing the total energy of the packets at this time to the total initial energy in the packets .",
