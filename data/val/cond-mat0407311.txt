    "different from other countries , korea is known to have relatively small number of family names .",
    "for example , the nationwide survey in 2000 has shown that the population of the family name kim is about 10 millions , which means that about one among four koreans is kim .",
    "in general , the family names have been devised to distinguish one family from others . accordingly ,",
    "if the number of family names is too small , or family sizes are too big , the distinction with other families becomes very inefficient . from this reasoning ,",
    "it is natural that koreans have developed additional way to give a kind of sub - system by using the information of the birthplace of the family name , i.e. , where the ancestor of the family came from .",
    "for example , one of the authors of the present paper has the family name kim from gimhae , a region in southern korea .",
    "the family name kim in 2000 survey has been found to have 348 different regional origins .",
    "almost all koreans know the regional origins of their family names from their births and the state keeps this information in the population registration .    in korean culture , having an unfamiliar family name is not common at all , and most people hesitate to invent new names . for 15 years from 1985 to 2000 ( table  [ mytable ] ) ,",
    "the number @xmath0 of family names in korea increased only by 11 ( @xmath1 increase ) .",
    "in contrast , the number @xmath2 of the family names with regional origins ( e.g. , kim from gimhae is taken as different than kim from gyeongju ) , is increased in the same period by 829 ( @xmath3 increase ) ( see table  [ mytable ] ) .",
    "consequently , this shows that most koreans consider inventing new family name as a taboo , while branching out by using new regional origins ( but with the same family name ) is totally acceptable in korean culture .    in this work , we study the distributions of the korean family names with and without regional origins . from the above observations ,",
    "one expects that the distributions look very different with and without the regional origins , and that the latter distribution is similar to other countries , where having new family name is not a taboo as in korea .    .",
    "date sets : korea00 and korea85 are for the total populations in korea in the years 2000 and 1985  @xcite .",
    "seongnam98 , osan04 , and hwaseong04 are extracted from telephone books , and ajou03 is obtained from the list of registered students in ajou university . @xmath2 and @xmath0 are numbers of family names with and without the regional origins , and @xmath4 is the population . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ mytable ]    the data sets analyzed in this work are as follows ( table  [ mytable ] ) : korea85 and korea00 are for the total population of korea in the years 1985 and 2000 , which were downloaded from korean national statistical office  @xcite .",
    "the set ajou03 is from the list of registered students in ajou university in 2003 , and the other sets seongnam98 , osan04 , and hwaseong04 are extracted from telephone books published in the corresponding cities at years 1998 , 2004 , and 2004 , respectively .",
    "we have information of the regional origins only in korea85 and korea00 . throughout the paper , @xmath4 is the size of populations , @xmath2 and @xmath0 are the numbers of family names with and without regional origins , respectively . for the @xmath5th family name ( when the family name is arranged from the biggest family to smallest one in descending order ) , @xmath6 is the number of people who have that name , leading to @xmath7 .",
    "we also use the integrated probability distribution function @xmath8 , which measures the proportion of the families with the size greater than @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : name ] , which contains the main results of the present work , we study various aspects of family name distributions without regional origins .",
    "the relationships among the three basic quantities , @xmath10 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 are analytically found and compared with empirical results .",
    "the distributions for various sizes of populations in table  [ mytable ] are compared with previous results in other countries .",
    "the empirically obtained growth rate as a function of the family size is also discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : regionname ] , we perform analysis on the distributions of family names with regional origin ( e.g. , kim s from different regional origins are considered to be different names ) .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec : conculsion ] is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "we first present in fig .  [",
    "fig : nfn ] the number @xmath0 of family names versus the population . as the population is increased , the number of family names is shown to increase logarithmically .",
    "this observation is in a sharp contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath11 has been observed in japan , instead of @xmath12 . due to the lack of information",
    ", we are not able to study @xmath2 versus @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintfk](a ) , the integrated distribution function @xmath8 , measuring the proportion of the family names with the populations greater than or equal to @xmath9 is displayed .",
    "since every family has at least one person as its member , one gets @xmath13 . as @xmath9 is increased , @xmath8 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath9 until @xmath14 is reached for @xmath15 . the logarithmic decay form in fig .  [ fig : pintfk](a ) is again very much different from the corresponding results for other countries , where the power - law form @xmath16 has been observed with @xmath17 for u.s.a and brazil  @xcite , and @xmath18 for japan  @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath19 , which is simply the normalized histogram , is easily obtained from the derivative of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath9 from @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 . in a practical point of view , @xmath8 is more convenient than @xmath19 , since some practical issues like the bin size in @xmath19 are not needed to be taken care of . as will be clearly shown below the same logarithmic form in figs .",
    "[ fig : nfn ] and [ fig : pintfk](a ) is not accidental .",
    "another convenient and frequently used way of showing the distribution is the so - called zipf s plot  @xcite , where the population @xmath6 of the family name is plotted in terms of the rank @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pintfk](b ) is the zipf s plot of @xmath6 obtained from the data set korea00 ( see table  [ mytable ] ) .",
    "clearly exhibited is that @xmath6 decays exponentially with @xmath5 , again in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite where the power - law decay has been observed .    the zipf s plot of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintfk](b ) and @xmath8 are easily related since @xmath8 is simply the number of family names of the size greater than @xmath9 : draw the horizontal line at the vertical position @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintfk](b ) and the value of @xmath5 at the crossing point is simply @xmath8 multiplied by @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "once the functional form @xmath6 is given , we obtain the relation @xmath23 connecting the zipf s plot and the integrated probability function and @xmath8 are of the power - law form has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "the function @xmath6 is always a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath5 by definition , which confirms the existence of the inverse function @xmath24 . via eq .",
    "( [ eq : pint ] ) the logarithmic form of @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintfk](a ) implies the exponential form of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintfk](b ) and vice versa .",
    "we next establish the simple mathematical relation between @xmath8 obtained for the total population @xmath25 and @xmath10 obtained for various sizes @xmath4 of population . the only one assumption we make",
    "is that the set of @xmath4 ( @xmath26 with @xmath27 individuals is taken at random without any bias . in other words ,",
    "the family at the rank @xmath5 has @xmath6 members in total , and thus in the subset of the size @xmath28 , there are @xmath29 members of the same name .",
    "consequently , once @xmath6 for the total population is given , @xmath0 for the subset of the size @xmath30 is simply the number of family names that has more than one individual , [ @xmath31 , which leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the heaviside step function with @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise . from the definition of @xmath6 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfx ] ) equals to the value of @xmath5 at the crossing point of the two curves @xmath6 and @xmath37 , yielding @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the identity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pint ] ) have been used .",
    "it should be noted that the relation between the zipf s plot of @xmath6 and the family name distribution function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pint ] ) should hold in any case , while the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath20 holds only when the assumption of unbiased random sampling of population is valid . as a specific example , for the power - law form @xmath40 , @xmath41 is expected .",
    "it is not clear whether or not this relation has been violated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where somehow self - contradictory results @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been concluded from the same unbiased random sampling of population .",
    "however , if the proper size of errorbars are taken , we strongly believe that the discrepancy should vanish .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnpk](a ) , @xmath10 from @xmath20 for korea00 and korea85 are displayed together with the values in table  [ mytable ] .",
    "although all curves show the logarithmic dependence , i.e. , @xmath12 , @xmath10 from @xmath20 computed by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfn ] ) shows a systematic difference that it lies higher than the empirical results at any @xmath4 .",
    "this makes us to conclude that the assumption of unbiased random sampling of population is not entirely valid for data sets in table  [ mytable ] .",
    "nevertheless , the logarithmic dependence persists for all three different curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnpk](a ) , which appears to justify the unbiased sampling assumption as a reasonable approximation .",
    "the substantial difference in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnpk](a ) can be interpreted as follows : significant number of families exist in localized area .",
    "for example , in some villages in rural area , most of people in the community have the same family name .",
    "another possibility is that new names originate from foreigners who just became koreans with new korean names .",
    "the latter case can be probably found only in the biggest city , seoul .",
    "those non - uniformly distributed names in a geographic sense are captured in nationwide survey but one can not find them in the telephone book in cities we are investigating in this work .",
    "accordingly , actual values of @xmath10 can be different and lie lower than the expected values from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfn ] ) based on the assumption of the unbiased random sampling .",
    "we then elaborate the above explanation further by introducing the probability @xmath44 that the name of the @xmath5th rank is chosen .",
    "the unbiased random sampling corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "the extension of the above derivation of @xmath10 is straightforward : the number of people of the name @xmath5 in the subset of population is now given by @xmath46 and the @xmath10 is the number of family names satisfying @xmath47 . from the same reasoning as before ,",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath48 now reads @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , one gets the expression of the probability that the name at the rank @xmath0 is chosen as @xmath50 we then use the values @xmath0 and @xmath4 from the empirical values in table  [ mytable ] and then take @xmath51 from the zipf s plot for korea00 to compute @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnpk](b ) , where seongnam98 , osan04 , ajou03 , hwaseong04 have been used .",
    "the data point ( marked as filled square ) for ajou03 is somehow special since ajou03 is not based on the residential location of individuals ( table  [ mytable ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath44 is a decreasing function of @xmath5 , suggesting that a randomly chosen individual in urban cities is more probable to have top rank names than for the whole nation .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the expectation that rare names ( with lower ranks ) are not distributed uniformly across the whole country .",
    "we also sampled randomly @xmath4 individuals ( @xmath52 ) from ajou03 and count how many names ( @xmath0 ) are found in the set .",
    "we then compute @xmath53 in the same way [ filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnpk](b ) ] .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the distributions of family names for various data sets in table  [ mytable ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zipfall ] , all data sets in table  [ mytable ] are shown to have qualitatively the same distribution : zipf s plots of @xmath6 for all data sets show exponential decay form , implying that the integrated probability distribution follows the logarithmic form ( see discussions in sec .",
    "[ subsec : relations ] ) .",
    "the unanimously found logarithmic form for @xmath8 then suggests that the probability distribution @xmath19 , which measures how many family names have the size @xmath9 , follows the following form @xmath54 with @xmath55 in korea , in a sharp contrast to other countries where @xmath56 have been concluded .",
    "this somehow unique family name distribution in korea can be understood from the birth - death model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that @xmath57 occurs in a stationary state if the total population does not grow ( or the death rate @xmath58 ) and the rate @xmath59 of new name generation is very small .",
    "the latter condition appears to be fulfilled in korea since only very small number of new names were generated between 1985 and 2000 ( see table  [ mytable ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the family names in korea have been introduced to korean societies very long time ago ( at least one thousand years ago ) , and therefore one can assume that the korean family name distribution is very close to the one at stationary state although the population is still growing .",
    "although new name generation is also very rare in japan like korea , family names in japan , on the contrary , have a short history ( most names were created about 120 years ago  @xcite ) .",
    "the qualitatively different family name distribution in japan appears to imply that the distribution is still far from its stationary state as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this perspective",
    ", it is very plausible that as time proceeds the family name distributions in other countries also should approach to @xmath57 eventually , in the condition that the rate of new name generation becomes sufficiently small .",
    "when the family name was introduced in human history , it is expected that the larger the family , the more probable the family s survival , since the size of the family was the measure of its strength in many respects such as the labor power and the number of warriors . in other words ,",
    "the population growth rate of a family must have been an increasing function of the size of the family long time ago . however , in a modern society , the population growth rate is not necessarily an increasing function of the family size since the size is no longer a matter of life and death .",
    "we use two data sets korea85 and korea00 to compute the growth rate of the family size for each family name in 15 years .",
    "the growth rate of the total population is 0.1377 during this period as shown in table  [ mytable ] .",
    "it is found that no name actually disappeared between 1985 and 2000 , but 11 new names were created . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnf ] , we plot the growth rate @xmath60 as a function of ( a ) the rank @xmath5 and ( b ) the size @xmath9 of the family .",
    "there are several very interesting features .",
    "the growth rate of some family is huge .",
    "for example , one family at very low rank had only one individual as its member in 1985 while the family size became 462 in 2000 , with the growth rate 461 in 15 years .",
    "this can never be explained from any biological reason ( no one can have several hundreds of children in 15 years ) , but rather must be a reflection of some sociological or psychological forces .",
    "relatively high growth rates are mostly observed in families at lower ranks , and @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnf](a ) is roughly an increasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "such a nonuniform growth rate can be explained from the assumption that ( 1 ) the family name with a high growth rate was recently invented and that ( 2 ) the family of a smaller size tries harder to increase the number of its members by e.g. , recruiting new members from relatives who still keep the old name .",
    "the above assumptions look reasonable since most people , especially who have small family sizes , probably want to see their names flourishing , not disappearing in the future .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnf](b ) , we display the growth rate @xmath62 as a function of the family size @xmath9 . as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : rnf](a ) , @xmath62 is a roughly decreasing function of @xmath9 , saturating towards the total growth rate @xmath63 .",
    "it is interesting to see that @xmath62 is significantly higher than @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "the size @xmath65 can be interpreted as the size scale beyond which the nonbiological growth is dominated by the biological growth .",
    "one can also associate @xmath65 with a psychological turning point in people s mind separating small and big families .",
    "as an additional way to distinguish families in korea , the regional origins of families are simultaneously used in korea . in this section , we regard the family name with different regional origins as distinctive names , e.g. , kim from gimhae and kim from gyeongju are considered to be different names , and study various aspects of the distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : pintnr ] shows the integrated probability function @xmath8 measuring the proportion of families which have more than @xmath9 family members .",
    "the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintnr ] , with the broad intermediate range described by the power - law behavior , is very different from the corresponding plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : pintfk ] . in other words ,",
    "the family name distributions are completely different with and without the regional origins .",
    "furthermore , although the distribution of the family names without information of regional origins in korea is very different from other countries , if the regional origins are used to distinguish one family from others the distribution shows the qualitatively similar behavior to that in other countries .",
    "more specifically , the power - law behavior @xmath66 [ i.e. @xmath16 ] is observed in a broad range of @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nrall ] is for the subsets of ( a ) korea00 and ( b ) korea85 .",
    "for example , kim00 is a subset of korea00 that contains only the name kim but from different regional origins .",
    "the three biggest families kim , lee , and park have 348 , 283 , and 159 different regional origins in korea00 , and 281 , 244 , and 127 in korea85 , implying that new regional origins have been branching out quite rapidly within a family . all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrall ] have similar power - law decay behaviors as in fig .  [",
    "fig : pintnr ] .",
    "we finally investigate in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnr ] the growth rate @xmath62 for the family name with regional origin as a function of the family size @xmath9 for ( a ) the whole dataset korea , and for three major family names ( b ) kim , ( c ) lee , and ( d ) park ; all show qualitatively the same behaviors as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnf ] in sec .",
    "[ subsec : growth ] , i.e. , very high growth rate for small families , and saturation to average growth rate beyond around @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to note that as long as the growth rate @xmath62 is concerned , the behavior does not depend much on whether the regional origins are taken into account or not .",
    "this implies that a family with very common family name but with a very rare regional origin still considers itself as small and thus makes tremendous nonbiological efforts to increase its members .",
    "we in this paper have studied the distributions of korean family names extracted from various sources : from nationwide surveys in 1985 and 2000 , from telephone books published in three cities , and from the list of registered student in a university .",
    "family name with and without regional origins have been found to show quite different distributions : integrated probability distribution is logarithmic without regional origins ( kim from gimhae and kim for gyeongju are regarded as the same name ) , while it is power - law behavior with regional origins ( kim from gimhae is considered to be different name than kim from gyeongju ) .",
    "the difference is also reflected in the zipf s plot of family size @xmath6 with the family rank @xmath5 : exponential versus power - law .",
    "relation between @xmath8 and @xmath6 have been established , and @xmath10 ( how many family names are found in population @xmath4 ) has been shown to have simple relation with @xmath6 ( and thus with @xmath8 ) by using the assumption of random unbiased sampling .",
    "the empirical observations show systematic deviations from the expected values , which was then used to compute the probability @xmath44 that the family at the rank @xmath5 is selected if we pick one individual at random .",
    "interestingly , @xmath44 has been found to be decreasing function of @xmath5 , implying that small family names are hard to find in general .",
    "growth rate @xmath62 for the family of the size @xmath9 has been computed from empirical data ( with and without regional origins ) .",
    "all show very interesting behaviors : huge growth rate [ @xmath69 in 15 years ] for small families implying nonbiological growth , and saturation towards average growth rate starting from around @xmath70 , which has been interpreted as the sociological / psychological separation point of big and small family .",
