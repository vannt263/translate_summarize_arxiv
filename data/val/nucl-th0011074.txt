    "the light front approach to quantum dynamics was introduced by dirac @xcite a half century ago . since then",
    ", light front dynamics has developed into an active area of research for a variety of reasons , e.g. its minimal set of dynamical operators , the simplicity of the light - front vacuum , and the close connection to experimental observables .",
    "light front techniques have long been used in analyzing high energy experiments with nuclear and nucleon targets @xcite .",
    "indeed light front dynamics is relevant to describe such reactions , since , for example : in the parton model , the ratio @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the plus momentum of the struck quark and @xmath8 that of the target ) is nothing more than the bjorken @xmath9-variable .",
    "some recent efforts have been made @xcite to render the theory more understandable by using models reminiscent of basic quantum mechanics rather than by invoking quantum field theory .",
    "these models find particular reality in nuclear physics @xcite , where some nucleon interactions may be described by a mean field potential .",
    "nonetheless , the similarity of the light - front bound state equation to the schrdinger equation is grounds enough to put familiar quantum mechanical problems on the light front .",
    "below , we do precisely this for the hulthn model of the deuteron and its electromagnetic form factor . of particular concern here is the asymptotic behavior of the form factor , which differs from the non - relativistic version .",
    "this may be of interest to experimentalists seeking to probe asymptopia .",
    "recent measurements of deuteron form factors at the jefferson national laboratory @xcite reach momentum transfers of @xmath10 gev@xmath1 and future projects hope to reach upwards of @xmath11 gev@xmath1 . in this range of momentum transfer",
    ", there is @xmath3 discrepancy between the relativistic and non - relativistic form factors calculated in this paper ( as we will illustrate in figure [ f : exp ] ) .",
    "this paper s organization is similar to that of a detective story .",
    "first we recall a minimal amount of light front dynamics in section [ s : lfd ] and explain how we put the non - relativistic hulthn potential on the light front .",
    "next in section [ s : ff ] , we calculate the electromagnetic form factor using light front dynamics and compare with the non - relativistic version calculated in section [ s : nrff ] .",
    "the low momentum behavior of the these form factors shows only minimal differences , while the high momentum behavior leads to surprising trouble in asymptopia ( section [ s : asym ] ) .",
    "we could solve the mystery at this point by deriving the asymptotic behavior of the form factor .",
    "instead , we proceed by assuming factorization holds in the asymptotic limit .",
    "this leads us to consider various previous attempts at dealing with the end - point region and to dispel any lingering misconceptions . in section [ s : sim ] , we discover that troublesome asymptotic behavior also lurks in other models on the light front . with enough clues at hand , we are able to pin - point the cause . the asymptotic behavior is then deduced in section [ s : ca ] , and is similar to that obtained for the wick - cutkosky model in ref .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in a brief concluding section .",
    "in light front dynamics , one quantizes the fields at equal light - front time specified by @xmath12 .",

    "if one uses @xmath15 as a spatial variable , then its momentum conjugate is @xmath16 .",
    "this leaves @xmath17 as the energy , or the @xmath18-development operator .",
    "the details of this formalism do not concern us here  the interested reader should consult @xcite for a good overview . what is important to note , however , is that the relativistic dispersion relation @xmath19 takes the form @xmath20 and thus the expression for the kinetic energy avoids the historically problematic square root .    for a bound state of two particles interacting via a potential @xmath21 ,",
    "the light - front wave function is determined by solving the equation @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the invariant mass of the system , @xmath24 the particle mass , and @xmath25 is the plus momentum fraction carried by the @xmath26 particle , namely @xmath27 , with @xmath28 as the total plus momentum , @xmath29 . let us take the nucleons to be of equal mass , and use @xmath30 as the nucleon mass .",
    "furthermore , since we have only two particles , the sum of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is one .",

    "it is clear that to leading order : @xmath73 , where the latter is the non - relativistic wave function .",
    "quite similarly , we see @xmath74 returning to the expression for the form factor , the non - relativistic limit is then @xmath75 the form factor above depends neither on the orientation of @xmath55 , nor of @xmath76 .",
    "let us then rotate our coordinate system so that @xmath55 is no longer completely transverse .",
    "this three - dimensional rotation is only possible now because we are integrating @xmath77 , which can not be done in the light - front version .",

    "this confirms our suspicion that relativistic effects in this deuteron model are small .",
    "we can further confirm this by looking at the difference of the relativistic form factor eq .",
    "[ e : hff ] and the non - relativistic version eq . [ e : hnr ] .",

    "so when scaled by @xmath94 , at worst the form factors will tend to some common difference as @xmath95 .    to compare the asymptotic behavior , we have plotted the relativistic and non - relativistic form factors ( scaled by @xmath96 ) for large @xmath65 ( in figure [ f : exp ] we plot for experimentally relevant @xmath97 , whereas in figure [ f : rnrhighq ] we are mathematically contrasting the asymptotics ) .",
    "the non - relativistic form factor lines up well with the asymptotic limit predicted by eq .",
    "[ e : nrasym ] .",
    "the relativistic form factor , however , markedly differs from its non - relativistic counterpart , in disagreement with the drell - yan - west relation eq .",
    "[ e : dyw ] .",
    "we remind the reader that the relativistic form factor is computed exactly for our model @xcite .",
    "the huge disparity between the non - relativistic and relativistic results , shown in figure [ f : rnrhighq ] warrants a complete journey through asymptopia .      before proceeding",

    "i is exactly the same as from ii which is made obvious by shifting @xmath54 .",

    "the end - point region appears to dominate the form factor in asymptopia ( as suggested in @xcite ) .",

    "[ e : asymf ] is really only valid for @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is some dimensionless cutoff less then one . for @xmath107",

    "[ e : hff ] , however , we know the end - point region does not overwhelmingly contribute ( as figure [ f : percent ] confirms ) .",
    "our dilemma sounds familiar @xcite and our approach , not surprisingly , is a regularization cutoff .    to start ,",
    "let us just toss away the troublesome divergent part of eq .",
    "[ e : asymf ] by introducing the cutoff @xmath106 into the @xmath9 integral @xmath117 the cutoff integral above can be computed analytically . using the integrand of eq .",

    "the wave function is @xcite @xmath191 where we have used the energy @xmath192 in the two - particle center of mass , and @xmath193 is given by equation [ e : p3 ] . here",
    "@xmath194 and @xmath195 with @xmath196 as the coupling constant present in the interaction term .",
    "the invariant mass of the system is @xmath197 . to write this wave function",

    "the difference between these approaches does not concern us for the ground state of scalar particles . for a review of explicitly covariant light - front dynamics see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the wave function in equation [ e : wcwf ] is quite similar to our coulomb wave function in section [ s : coulomb ] .",
    "the extra term in the denominator originates from retardation effects contained in the relativistic potential ( effects which our nave models clearly lack ) .",
    "the behavior of the wave function at the end point is not modified ( to leading order in @xmath168 ) by retardation .",
    "furthermore , the retarded potential is @xcite @xmath198 with @xmath199 where @xmath200 is given by equation [ e : diffp ] . using this potential for asymptotic @xmath65",
    ", we note @xmath201 which is singular at @xmath202 . given this and the wave function s end - point behavior , we once again appeal to equation [ e : it ] and a logarithmically divergent @xmath9-integral confronts us in deducing the asymptotic behavior of the form factor .",
    "our experience above leads us to believe the true asymptotic behavior is @xmath203 modified by a logarithm .",
    "this asymptotic behavior for the wick - cutkosky model has been found previously by karmanov and smirnov @xcite by considering regions which dominate the @xmath9 and @xmath56 integrals of the form factor .",
    "the same asymptotic behavior of the wick - cutkosky model was also found @xcite by using the bethe - salpeter approach .",
    "karmanov and smirnov state that the logarithmic @xmath204 behavior was also been found earlier in @xcite  a paper which admits the possibility of such logarithms only by announcing it is not considering such cases .",
    "the presence of logarithmic modifications to relativistic form factors is discussed in @xcite , where the authors interpret the drell - yan - west relation as valid modulo logarithms .",
    "nonetheless , the correct asymptotic behavior of the wick - cutkosky form factor was deduced in @xcite as we shall now demonstrate using techniques considered above .",
    "considering the analytic form of the wave function [ e : wcwf ] , we can see a region which dominates the form factor for asymptotic @xmath65 : @xmath9 near @xmath205 . in this case , we can surely say @xmath206 and consequently the analysis leading to equation [ e : asymf ] is certainly valid . moreover , the wick - cutkosky wave function is identical to our coulomb wave function for @xmath207 . thus appealing to equation [ e : asymf ] ,",
    "we find ( to leading order about @xmath208 ) @xmath209 \\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed @xmath210 so that @xmath211 . in order to compare with @xcite",
    ", we have been careful to adopt their normalization ( we have multiplied our expression [ e : ff ] by @xmath212 . )    the other dominant contribution in asymptopia comes from _ near _ the end - point region @xmath213 as we have seen above by producing logarithms from regularized @xmath9-integrals .",
    "we can thus deduce the remaining contribution in asymptopia via regularization .",
    "this result will be different from the coulomb result , equation [ e : asymcoul ] , due to the retardation factor .",
    "first we note that in the near end - point region @xmath214 . now take @xmath215 and hence the contribution which interests us reads @xmath216 \\big ( 1 + \\mathcal{o}\\big[\\frac{1}{q }   \\big ] \\big )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combining these two results ( using only the logarithmic part of the latter ) , we arrive at the asymptotic behavior ( to leading order in @xmath217 ) @xmath218 which agrees with the result found by karmanov and smirnov @xcite .",
    "furthermore one can use the wick - cutkosky wave function above to numerically calculate the form factor and test equation [ e : asymwc ] as predicting its asymptotic behavior .",
    "this form factor is less complicated than the hulthn model s .",
    "consequently , the numerical integration is precise to larger @xmath65 .",
    "as before , we have graphically determined the coefficients @xmath219 in equation [ e : ab ] and observed the asymptotic behavior as tending toward @xmath220 , with @xmath221 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath140 agrees well with equation [ e : asymwc ] , differing by @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",
    "the error of the coefficient @xmath148 depends on how rapidly the series in @xmath217 converges . for @xmath224 ,",
    "our graphically determined @xmath148 differs from equation [ e : asymwc ] by @xmath225 . while for @xmath226 , the error is @xmath227 .",
    "indeed we have deduced the form factor s asymptotic behavior .",
    "our analysis above has been quite general and we shall now apply it to the hulthn form factor . to finish our quest through asymptopia , it remains to determine the coefficient @xmath148 in equation [ e : ab ] for the hulthn model . as we learned above in equation [ e : asymf ] gives the coefficient @xmath148 up to a possible factor of @xmath228 .",
    "] , considering the contribution for @xmath207 gives us @xmath148 for asymptotic @xmath65 .",
    "so we return to equation [ e : asymf2 ] and expand to leading order about @xmath208 @xmath229 dx.\\ ] ] having used @xmath230 . at first glance",
    ", it appears we have dropped a factor of two from the asymptotic expression [ e : asymf2 ] .",
    "however careful consideration of region i ( in equation [ e : regions ] ) , shows its contribution vanishes ( to leading order in @xmath179 ) .",
    "evaluating the above integral and combining with the logarithmic part of our previous result ( equation [ e : first ] ) , we find @xmath231.\\ ] ] from which we deduce @xmath232 ( and @xmath136 as discussed previously ) . comparing with the graphically determined result of section [ s : cr ] , we see that there is a @xmath233 difference .",
    "again this difference is due to the series expansion in small parameters : @xmath234 and @xmath235 . for smaller values of the parameters",
    ", we expect better results .",
    "however , with smaller parameters one needs higher @xmath65 to graphically determine @xmath219 and the numerical integration becomes imprecise .",
    "nonetheless , within our constraints we have verified equation [ e : theend ] as the asymptotic behavior of the hulthn form factor .",
    "we have undertaken a relatively simple task to compare relativistic and non - relativistic form factors for the hulthn model of the deuteron . for small momentum transfer ,",
    "the two versions differ by about a percent and the root mean square radii differ by even less . the behavior for large @xmath65 , however , led us on an unexpected journey .",
    "our expedition through asymptopia helped us learn the hulthn form factor s true behavior @xmath236 for large @xmath65 .",
    "the path was circuitous because the conventional means ( asymptotic expressions , taylor series expansions ) lead directly to logarithmic divergences .",
    "these difficulties are manifestations of the non - commutativity of the limits @xmath95 and @xmath157 , and hence indicative of the breakdown of factorization .    indeed , we find that this behavior is not particular to the hulthn model .",
    "equation [ e : it ] tracks down the root of these difficulties .",
    "generating our light front wave functions from non - relativistic potentials singular at the origin will lead to problematic relativistic form factors in the asymptotic limit .",
    "such problems do not plague calculations in fundamental theories because higher - order corrections necessarily cancel the divergences . for realistic models",
    ", however , the breakdown of factorization persists and is an obstruction to straightforward asymptotic calculations .",
