    "since the discovery of graphite as a homogeneous substrate for investigation of physisorbed monolayer films and various helium phases on it  @xcite , the most interesting question is whether he - he or he - c atomic interactions define helium behavior .",
    "the study of adsorption of helium atoms on solid substrates therefore is important for both adsorption properties of surfaces and behavior of he atoms .",
    "moreover , it was found that restricted geometry , such as nanoporous media or a two - dimensional substrate , provides new and unique features of helium .",
    "for example , it was shown that in a porous medium a new helium phase appears  @xcite .",
    "novel materials such as substrates can also lead to a new behavior of helium due to a different potential created by the substrate  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that at certain densities and temperatures helium monolayers on graphene and graphite form commensurate and incommensurate solid phases and create a two - dimensional lattice  @xcite .",
    "such structures were investigated previously  @xcite by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations . in the present work we have investigated the adsorption and stability of the first helium layers adsorbed on graphene by means of quasi harmonic approximation within density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite in order to examine the method .",
    "investigations were then carried out on the new two - dimensional material s surface silicene in order to discover new possible adsorption properties of helium .",
    "silicene is a graphene - like si - based material , which was first predicted theoretically  @xcite and then obtained experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of this material is almost identical to graphene  @xcite but it exhibits a buckled surface and larger interatomic distance .",
    "one can expect , therefore , that similar solid phases of helium on silicene will be expanded .",
    "simulations of helium adsorption in different media such as a graphene nanotube  @xcite and a porous material called aerogel  @xcite within different variations of dft methods have recently been obtained .",
    "all the results show that dft methods give an accurate description of the adsorption phenomenon .",
    "moreover , it is known that among _ ab initio _ methods dft allows a balance to be achieved between computational cost and accuracy .",
    "we started with the he - graphene system as a reference for verification of our simulation technique as there are a lot of experimental and theoretical data about adsorption and interaction of he atoms with graphene and graphite substrates  @xcite .",
    "in addition , graphene and silicene both have similar structure and c and si atoms are isovalent .",
    "the calculations were performed using dft method with gradient - corrected exchange , correlation energy functionals and projector augmented - wave method  @xcite implemented in vasp code  @xcite in medea @xcite program .",
    "the maximum kinetic energy of plane waves in a basis set was equal to 480ev . to integrate in the brillouin zone we used",
    "equidistant mokhorst - pack k - mesh @xmath0 centered at gamma point and methfessel - paxton @xcite smearing with the parameter 0.2ev .",
    "optimization of the atomic positions was done by the conjugate gradient method with the maximal force equal to 0.005ev /  . in order to simulate the two - dimensional structure we added a 15  vacuum slab in the perpendicular to the surface direction .",
    "we tested different computational approaches consisting of employing different types of exchange - correlation parts in the energy functional in order to better reproduce the he - graphene interaction potential .",
    "we also checked the van der waals corrections due to the fact that at large distances , the he - substrate interaction is governed by van der waals interaction .",
    "the obtained data was compared with the potential calculated by semiempirical method , based on the scattering of helium on graphite suggested in  ref.@xcite .",
    "taking into account the van der waals corrections  @xcite is essential for correct reproduction of he - graphene interaction ( see fig.[fig : gr - he_interaction ] ) .",
    "however , using such van der waals functionals as rev - pbe  @xcite , optb88 , optb86b  @xcite and optpbe leads to overestimation of potential well .",
    "gga - pbe functional with semiempirical dft - d2  @xcite correction for long - range interaction reproduced the semiempirical data well and was chosen for further simulations .    to investigate the stability of the adsorbed helium monolayers we have calculated vibrational properties using medea - phonon module , which implements a direct approach of harmonic approximation  @xcite .",
    "the so - called direct approach to lattice dynamics is based on the ab initio evaluation of forces on all atoms produced by a set of finite displacements of a few atoms within an otherwise perfect crystal .",
    "the simulation model of silicene consists of one atomic layer of silicone atoms with crystallographic surface ( 001 ) of bulk silicone and space group symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "the optimized hexagonal cell has a lattice size 3.85and interatomic distance @xmath2   ( close to @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath4  @xcite)and a buckling height @xmath5 .",
    "we have calculated he - silicene interaction potentials in the perpendicular direction at various symmetric positions of he atom above the silicene surface .",
    "[ fig : si - he_interaction](b ) demonstrates that the deepest potential well for helium is on the top of point s , corresponding to the center of the si hexagon .",
    "the depth of the potential well for a helium atom is @xmath6 = 14mev and equilibrium height is @xmath7 = 3.20 .",
    "the positions ah , al and sp of a helium atom have energy of about 4mev higher , which corresponds to 48k .",
    "thus the position s is the most preferable adsorption site at low temperatures .",
    "the interaction potential above the s point was approximated as a sum of pairwise lennard - jones ( lj ) interactions between he and each si atom in a range 10 .",
    "lj parameters are @xmath8mev and @xmath9 3.6 .",
    "we have computed a potential energy profile of a helium atom on the silicene surface along the lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si - he_interaction](a ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : si - he_interaction](d ) that the center of the hexagon ( s point ) represents a potential well for the helium atom as in the perpendicular direction .",
    "( a ) , c@xmath10 ( b ) and c@xmath11 ( c ) helium phases on graphene and si@xmath12 ( d ) , si@xmath10 ( e ) and si@xmath11 ( f ) helium phases on silicene .",
    "presence of imaginary modes indicates structural instability.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    recent qmc calculations have shown that a helium monolayer adsorded on graphene at low temperatures could demonstrate different phases depending on helium coverage  @xcite . at low coverages",
    "there is stable c@xmath12 commensurate solid phase , which is characterized by one he atom corresponding to three adsorption sites ( s points )  @xcite . at higher helium coverage range",
    "the domain walls phase exists . at a certain he density value",
    "the c@xmath10 commensurate solid phase occurs . with subsequent density increase ,",
    "the incommensurate phases are formed . at even higher helium coverage",
    "a second he layer should appear  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated stability of an adsorbed helium monolayer on graphene in three different phases c@xmath12 , c@xmath10 and c@xmath11 ( with 0.063 , 0.083 , 0.19@xmath13 coverages respectively ) .",
    "the presence of vibrational modes with imaginary frequencies usually point out the structural instability . in fig",
    "[ fig : gr - he_dos ] the density of states of vibrational spectra are given .",
    "as one can see , phase c@xmath12 does not have any imaginary modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gr - he_dos ] ( a ) ) , implying stability of adsorbed layer , whereas c@xmath10 and c@xmath11 phases are unstable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr - he_dos](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "however , qmc simulation demonstrates the stability of the c@xmath10 phase .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by the lack of he atom zero point motion in our approach , where this effect could stabilize the inplane motion .",
    "imaginary modes for vibrations of helium in the c@xmath11 phase along @xmath14 direction indicates layer promotion because of high he - he atoms repulsion , which is agrees well agreed with qmc calculations .    in the case of helium on silicene",
    "the same phases correspond to 0.026 , 0.034 , 0.078@xmath13 coverages respectively .",
    "the simulations show its instability by the presence of imaginary modes for he atoms in @xmath15 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr - he_dos](d - f ) ) .",
    "it could be interpreted as the tendency of he atoms to group into small clusters with higher density because of the large si - si distance and less attractive he - silicene potential in comparison to graphene .",
    "we have explored stability of adsorbed monoatomic layers of helium within born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation for graphene substrate and found that for low coverages there is conformity with qmc calculations .",
    "as coverage is increased zero point effects become dominant and results of bo and qmc simulations differ .",
    "however , bo calculation points to the formation of a second layer for high he coverage that correlates with qmc calculations .",
    "the similar phases of helium on silicene substrate were found to be unstable .",
    "the depth of the potential well for he atom on silicene is about 14mev compared to 24mev on graphene according to our calculations .",
    "the equilibrium position of a he atom above these surfaces also differs  3.20  and 2.93  for silicene and graphene respectively .",
    "one can conclude , therefore , that silicene is less attractive substrate for he atom adsorption than graphene ."
