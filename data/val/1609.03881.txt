    "msg is played by two players against a referee and utilizing a pre - shared quantum system of 4 qubits in a specific pure entangled state , players can win the game with unit probability , while players equipped only with classical resources can achieve a winning probability at most @xmath0 @xcite . in practical applications , however , due to inevitable interactions of the state with the environment @xcite , or even accelerating players @xcite , the entanglement of the state may decrease considerably , leading to the decrease of the winning probability even far below the classical limit . on the other hand ,",
