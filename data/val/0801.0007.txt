    "two independent and foundational papers on finite spaces of 1966 , by m.c . mccord and r.e .",

    "mccord @xcite associates to a finite simplicial complex @xmath0 , the finite @xmath1-space @xmath2 which corresponds to the poset of simplices of @xmath0 and proves that there is a weak homotopy equivalence @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , one can associate to a given finite @xmath1-space @xmath4 the simplicial complex @xmath5 of its non - empty chains and a weak homotopy equivalence @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to mccord s approach , stong introduces a combinatorial method to describe the homotopy types of finite spaces .",
    "he defines the notions of _ linear and _ colinear points , which we call _ down and _ up beat points following peter may s terminology , and proves that two finite spaces have the same homotopy type if and only if one of them can be obtained from the other by adding or removing beat points .",
    "recently a series of notes by peter may @xcite caught our attention to finite spaces . in his notes , may discusses various basic problems from the perspective of finite spaces .",
    "it is evident , from mccord s and stong s papers and from may s notes , that finite topological spaces can be used to develop new techniques , based on their combinatorial and topological nature , to investigate homotopy theory of polyhedra .",
    "a nice example of this is stong s paper of 1984 @xcite where he restates quillen s conjecture on the poset of non - trivial @xmath7-subgroups of a group @xcite in terms of finite spaces . also in this direction , we showed in @xcite how to use finite spaces to study simple homotopy types .",
    "_ _ _ _    this article deals with one - point reductions .",
    "we investigate the cases in which removing a particular point of the space does not affect its homotopy , weak homotopy or simple homotopy type . our starting point is theorem 3.10 of @xcite , which relates simplicial collapses with collapses of finite spaces .",
    "more explicitly , we have proved in @xcite that a collapse @xmath8 between finite spaces induces a collapse @xmath9 between their associated simplicial complexes and a simplicial collapse @xmath10 induces a collapse between the associated finite spaces .",
    "one advantage of working with finite spaces is that the elementary collapses in this context are very simple to handle and describe : they consist of removing a single point of the space , which is called a _ weak point .",
    "the beat points introduced by stong @xcite and the weak points defined in @xcite constitute particular cases of one - point reductions .",
    "the main idea that is behind the one - point reductions is the idea of an _ elementary move , which appears frequently in mathematics .",
    "tietze transformations and whitehead s theory on simple homotopy types are two leading exponents of this concept .",
    "the results that we obtain allow one to study homotopy theory of cell complexes by means of elementary moves of their _ finite models .",
    "a finite model of a cw - complex @xmath0 is a finite space which is weak homotopy equivalent to @xmath0 . _ _ _    in this paper we introduce the notions of @xmath11-point and @xmath11-collapse which provide a more general method of reduction .",
    "more precisely , we prove below the following    if @xmath12 is a @xmath11-point , the inclusion @xmath13 is a weak homotopy equivalence .",
    "this also improves an old result which appears for example in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.8 ) .",
    "moreover , we prove that the converse of proposition [ idaa ] also holds provided @xmath14 is neither maximal nor minimal ( see theorem [ vueltaa ] ) . therefore , the elementary @xmath11-collapses describe almost all possible one - point reductions .",
    "we also investigate collapsibility and @xmath11-collapsibility of the joins @xmath15 of finite spaces in terms of the collapsibility of @xmath4 and @xmath16 .",
    "this sheds some light on the analogous problem for simplicial joins .    in the last section of the paper",
    "we introduce the concept of _ h - regular cw - complex_. recall that a cw - complex is called regular if the characteristic maps of its cells are homeomorphisms .",
    "it is known that if @xmath0 is a regular cw - complex , its face poset @xmath17 is a finite model of @xmath0 . for general cw - complexes the associated finite space @xmath17 does not give relevant information about the topology of @xmath0 .",
    "regular cw - complexes can be thought of as combinatorial objects ( in fact , they are in the middle way between simplicial complexes and general cw - complexes ) .",
    "this suggests that one can extend the class of combinatorial cw - complexes to a wider class of combinatorial - up - to - homotopy cw - complexes that can be modeled , up to homotopy , by their associated finite spaces .",
    "this leads to the notion of _ h - regular cw - complex_. a cw - complex is h - regular if all its closed cells are contractible subcomplexes . in particular , regular complexes are h - regular .",
    "we prove that if @xmath0 is a finite h - regular complex , there is a weak homotopy equivalence @xmath18 , generalizing mccord s result for finite simplicial complexes ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "the paper ends with the following result which relates collapses of h - regular complexes with @xmath11-collapses .",
