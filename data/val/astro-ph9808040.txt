    "the recent confirmation of a submillimetre background ( @xcite ) with approximately the same integrated intensity as the optical background ( @xcite ) shows that to understand galaxy formation and evolution it is crucial to take into account that part of a galaxy s starlight that is absorbed by dust and re - radiated at longer wavelengths .",
    "the integrated background is the repository of all the stellar energy that has ever been emitted ( with a @xmath7 weighting factor ) , and so the contribution of a particular class of galaxies to the background is a measure of its importance in the star - formation history of the universe . determining the relative contribution to the background of different galaxy classes may be of particular importance for answering the question of how ellipticals and spiral bulges formed .",
    "the quantity of metals associated with nearby early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) implies that early - type galaxies should be responsible for about half the background (  4 ) .",
    "nevertheless , optical surveys have failed to find convincing evidence of proto - spheroids .",
    "possible explanations of this failure are ( a ) that when the stars formed they were spread over a large volume of space before gradually coalescing to form galaxies ( explaining the absence of discrete sources ) , ( b ) that the starbursts are hidden by dust . in both cases",
    ", these objects will still be contributing to the background ; in the latter case they should be dominating the submillimetre background ( @xcite ) .",
    "the prospects for resolving the submillimetre background are good because of the commissioning of the scuba submillimetre array ( @xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "last year a group carried out a submillimetre survey of two clusters , using the gravitational magnification by the clusters as an aid for finding distant submillimetre sources .",
    "they found four sources and concluded that optical surveys had significantly underestimated the number of star - forming galaxies in the distant universe ( @xcite , sib , @xcite ) .",
    "we and others ( @xcite ) have now started ` blind - field ' surveys with scuba , which do not have the aid of gravitational amplification but do not suffer from the uncertainties of the cluster lens method .",
    "we are carrying out our survey in fields used for the canada - france redshift survey ( @xcite ) and our aim is eventually to survey 200 arcmin@xmath8 of the sky . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of a survey of an area of 22 arcmin@xmath8 and analyse these using the results of a parallel survey we are carrying out of the submillimetre properties of the local universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "a second paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) will discuss the optical counterparts to the distant submillimetre sources .",
    "we observed three fields simultaneously at 450 and 850 @xmath0 m on 12 nights during january and march 1998 , using the same observing procedure as sib , with the exception that we chopped and nodded 30 arcsec ew .",
    "we divided our observations into integrations lasting about one hour , checking the telescope pointing before and after each integration .",
    "the optical depth during these nights varied between 0.57 and 1.65 at 450 @xmath0 m and between 0.13 and 0.29 at 850 @xmath0 m . for the first field we simply made repeated observations at the same position ( @xmath9 [ 2000.0 ] ) , giving a total integration time of 36.096 ks . for the second field we made eight integrations ( 21.504 ks in total ) at one position ( @xmath10 [ 2000.0 ] ) and four integrations ( 12.8 ks ) at a second position ( @xmath11 [ 2000.0 ] ) ) 27 arcsec away from the first . for the final field we made observations in a mosaic pattern such that each point in the final map was constructed from data received at nine locations within the instrument field of view . since the instrument is fixed in naysmith coordinates , and thus the bolometers move on the sky , this ensures that a point on the final map contains data from a large fraction of the available bolometers , reducing the possibility of problems with individual bolometers generating spurious sources .",
    "we reduced our data in the standard way using the surf package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final maps are shown in figs 1 & 2 .",
    "since any real object is likely to be unresolved and will appear on a map as a positive source with two negative sources 30 arcsec on either side , we used template analysis ( @xcite ) to look for sources of this kind on the 850-@xmath0 m maps , using as a template a map of uranus made with the same 30-arcsec chop .",
    "the negative emission is actually more complex than this because the chop direction is only precisely ew at the beginning of each integration , then remaining fixed at a constant azimuthal angle ( this causes the slight rotation of the negative lobes visible in fig .",
    "2a ) , but this is a reasonable approximation . after trimming off the edge of each image , which is populated by noise artefacts due to incomplete sampling of the sky near the array s edge , we made both a map of the correlation coefficient ( cc ) , a measure of how closely the emission resembles the template , and a map of the convolution of the image with the template ( fig .",
    "the noise on the template - convolved images is 0.56 , 0.76 , and 0.92 mjy per beam for the 3@xmath12 , 10@xmath12 , and 14@xmath12 fields .",
    "we included a source in our catalogue only if both @xmath13 on the convolved map and @xmath14 , the latter criterion reducing the chance of noise spikes , which do not have the distinctive negative lobes , being included .",
    "we checked the reality of our sources in two ways .",
    "first , we created the negative of each map and confirmed that no sources were found using the same selection criteria .",
    "second , we generated monte - carlo simulations of the fields , replacing the data for each bolometer ( which is sampled every second ) with the output from a gaussian random - number generator with the same standard deviation as for that bolometer ( measured separately for each one - hour integration ) .",
    "the simulations showed that spurious sources tended to be concentrated towards the edges of our fields as expected , and we used the simulations to define ` reliable regions ' for each map ( figs 1 & 2 ) .",
    "the sources listed in table 1 are from these regions , and the simulations suggest that , on average , one of these could be spurious . because of the possibility that the rotation of the chop direction could affect fluxes estimated by template - fitting , we also estimated fluxes by aperture photometry , finding no significant difference for the two methods .",
    "3 shows the integral source counts from our survey . an incompleteness analysis similar to that in sib implies we are missing 0 , 19 , and 48% of the sources with fluxes of 6 , 4 , and 3 mjy respectively .",
    "our source counts are consistent with those of the other small blank - field surveys ( @xcite ) and of sib .",
    "the sources we have detected at 850 @xmath0 m account for 19% of the background emission at 850@xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "4 ) , rising to 30% if a correction is made for incompleteness , and @xmath1510% of the background emission at 450@xmath0 m . our four measurements and seven limits on the 450@xmath0m/850@xmath0 m ratio are consistent with the average ratio being similar to that of the background emission , and thus consistent with the 850@xmath0 m sources being representative of the background at shorter submillimetre wavelengths as well . on the assumption",
    "that the sub - mm objects detected in our survey make a negligible contribution to the optical background ( paper ii ) , these objects account for @xmath1611% of the total optical - near - ir plus submillimetre background ( @xcite ) , rising to @xmath1617% if the incompleteness correction is made .",
    "it is possible that this level of background emission might be explained by agn .",
    "if the black - hole masses measured in nearby galaxies by hst ( @xcite ) are typical of galaxies in general , and if one makes the assumption that 10% of the mass accreting into a black hole is turned into energy , then the agn background would be @xmath410% of the background from stars .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in this calculation , we will henceforth make the more conservative assumption that we are observing emission from dust heated by stars .",
    "the integrated background emission produced by a population at a redshift @xmath17 is related to the smoothed out cosmic density of processed material @xmath18 produced by these objects by @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since our sources make up a significant fraction of the background , they must represent a population which has been responsible for a significant fraction of all the star formation that has ever occured . in paper ii",
    "we show that these sources are similar to the galaxies with huge far - infrared luminosities discovered with iras ( @xcite ) .",
    "this combination of high individual bolometric luminosities and a significant contribution to the background emission is exactly what one expects for one mode of proto - spheroid formation (  1 ) , and it is hard to resist the conclusion that these are these long - sought objects ( see also @xcite ) . note that , with their huge bolometric luminosities and implied star - formation rates , it has long been suspected that ultra - luminous iras galaxies might be ellipticals in the process of formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "what has been lacking is direct evidence that objects like this at high redshift are responsible for a significant fraction of the star formation in the universe .",
    "an obvious question to ask is whether these objects are at @xmath20 , as are the galaxies that dominate the optical background ( @xcite ) , or whether they are at higher redshifts , as one might suspect from the ages of the stellar populations in nearby ellipticals ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will address this question by making the null hypothesis that the submillimetre luminosity density evolves in the same way as the @xmath3 luminosity density ( @xcite ) and predicting the submillimetre source counts and background .",
    "if the observed counts and background exceed our predictions , this might be evidence for a population of galaxies at @xmath21 . in paper ii we will examine this question using the optical identifications .",
    "the biggest problem in modelling the submillimetre source counts and background has been the lack of information about the submillimetre properties of nearby galaxies . without this information , one is forced to start from a local iras 60-@xmath22 luminosity function and make an assumption about the average far - infrared / submillimetre sed of galaxies , an extrapolation of a factor of over 10 in wavelength ( @xcite ) . to overcome this problem , we have been carrying out a parallel submillimetre survey of the local universe ( @xcite ) . by measuring submillimetre fluxes for galaxies drawn from statistically - complete samples of iras and optically - selected galaxies , we can both determine the sed s for different types of galaxy and ( using accessible - volume techniques@xcite ) the local submillimetre luminosity function .",
    "as yet our local 850-@xmath0 m luminosity function is only well constrained at high submillimetre luminosities , which is acceptable for making source - count predictions , since it is only the high - luminosity sources which contribute at the flux densities of interest , but not for estimating the background .",
    "3 shows our source - count predictions .",
    "we implemented our null hypothesis in two ways : ( i ) by having the amplitude of the local luminosity function evolve with the same form as the luminosity density ; ( ii ) by having the luminosities of the sources evolve with this form .",
    "3 shows that with luminosity evolution , but not with space - density evolution , the predicted counts match the observed counts fairly well .",
    "if one assumes no evolution at all , the observed source counts exceed the predicted counts by a large factor , as noted by @xcite .    for modelling the background we are thrown back on the iras 60-@xmath0 m luminosity function ( @xcite ) ,",
    "but we do have the advantage over previous studies of empirical results on the far - ir - submillimetre sed s of galaxies .",
    "the 60 , 100 , and 850-@xmath0 m fluxes of iras galaxies are well fitted by a single - temperature dust spectrum with a dust - emissivity index of 1 and @xmath23 over the range @xmath24 , @xmath25 being defined as in lawrence et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we do not claim that the dust - emissivity index is 1 and that there is dust of only one temperature in these galaxies , merely that this is a good empirical fit to the fluxes .",
    "4 shows predictions using the iras luminosity function and this assumption about galaxy sed s .",
    "the measured background is far in excess of the no - evolution model , but the model in which the submillimetre luminosity density evolves in the same way as the @xmath3 luminosity density matches the spectral shape and amplitude of the background remarkably well .",
    "our conclusion that the null hypothesis of evolution like that in the optical waveband is acceptable ( further supported by the analysis in paper ii ) should be contrasted with recent claims to the contrary ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference is not in the data , but in the assumptions made about the local sed s .",
    "blain et al .",
    ", for example , assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "when compared with our assumptions about sed s , this makes a factor of @xmath49 difference in intensity at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "the level of the background can also be used to argue against a major population of dust - enshrouded proto - ellipticals at @xmath28 .",
    "let us assume that all the stars in this hypothetical population form instantaneously at a redshift @xmath29 and that the sed from one of these objects is the same as that of the archetypical local iras galaxy arp 220 ( the precise sed is not important ) .",
    "this is enough to define the _ shape _ of the background .",
    "the maximum amplitude of this background is then set by the observed cobe background ( fig .",
    "4 ) . we then subtract this maximal elliptical background from the observed background to get a remnant background , which we assume is from the spiral / irregular population . if we then assume that late - type galaxies go through their period of maximum star formation at @xmath30 , we can then use the equation above and the ratio of the two backgrounds to predict the relative contributions to the present - day metal abundance of the two populations . if @xmath31 the dusty ellipticals can produce @xmath3238% of the metals of the other population and if @xmath33 this falls to @xmath328% .",
    "observations suggest , however , that the ratio of the global metal abundance associated with ellipticals to that that associated with spirals / irregulars lies between 1 and 6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy again suggests that ellipticals form at relatively modest redshifts .",
