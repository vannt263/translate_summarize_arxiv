    "the goal of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project on the extragalactic distance scale is to measure the redshift - distance relation from cepheid variables ( e.g. freedman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , the distance modulus for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) that normalizes the hst cepheid distances is a matter of some debate .",
    "because the extrema of published results formally differ at the 3@xmath1 level ( gibson 1999 ) , it is clear that significant and unappreciated systematic uncertainties exist in some or all of the methods .",
    "it has been argued ( paczynski 1997 , 2000 ) that with current technology , detached eclipsing binaries provide the most direct and accurate distance to the magellanic clouds ( see paczynski 1997 for a simple outline of the method , and kruszewski & semeniuk 1999 for an historical outlook ) . two examples ( for the lmc )",
    "are already in the literature ( guinan et al .",
    "1998 ; fitzpatrick et al .",
    "2001 ) , demonstrating the potential of the technique .",
    "furthermore , a consistency check on the eclipsing binary method was presented by semeniuk ( 2000 ) , who compared detached eclipsing binary parallaxes by lacy ( 1979 ) with hipparcos parallaxes and found good agreement .",
    "the attributes of the most promising eclipsing binary systems for distance determination were discussed by paczynski ( 1997 ) .",
    "the two stars should be similar , in size and effective temperature , and have radii much smaller than the stellar separation .",
    "in addition , the inclination should be high to facilitate deep eclipses .",
    "furthermore , the most reliable distances will come from objects that are subject to very small amounts of interstellar reddening .",
    "systems where the stars are completely eclipsed are particularly important because they can provide robust measurements of the ratio of radii . in this paper",
    "we have restricted our attention to detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "however we note that semi - detached and over - contact systems often have photometric solutions that are better constrained , and will also be useful for distance determination .",
    "we define over - contact to mean that both stars exceed their critical lobes ( _ viz . _",
    "wilson , 2001 ) .    with high quality spectroscopic and photometric observations ,",
    "standard eclipsing binary light curve fitting routines provide accurate masses , sizes and surface brightness ratios for the components of a double lined eclipsing binary .",
    "indeed , eclipsing binaries have been a primary source of fundamental stellar data ( e.g. andersen 1991 ) .",
    "the distance to an eclipsing binary follows from the dimensions thus determined plus the absolute surface brightnesses , which are inferred from the spectral types , either through model atmospheres or an empirical relation .",
    "empirical studies of the surface brightness - color relation are based on the determination of stellar radii by interferometry ( e.g. di benedetto 1998 ; van belle et al .",
    "eclipsing binaries with independently measured distances can also be used to calibrate the relation .",
    "kruszewski & semeniuk ( 1999 ) published a list of nearby ea - type eclipsing binaries with measured hipparcos parallaxes for this purpose , and argued that it was the superior method .    in recent years",
    "the massive photometric monitoring programs ( primarily for microlensing ) directed toward the magellanic clouds have discovered large numbers of variable stars including eclipsing binaries ( e.g. grison et al .",
    "1995 ; alcock et al . 1997",
    "; udalski et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these catalogs motivate systematic searches for rare , close to ideal systems .",
    "alcock et al . (",
    "1997 ) presented photometric fits to 611 eclipsing binaries in the lmc based on the nelson - davis - etzel model ( etzel 1981 ; popper & etzel 1981 ) .",
    "here we use the catalog of eclipsing binaries produced for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by the ogle collaboration ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 , see that paper for details of the catalog selection ) , which has dense photometric i - band light curves for 1459 eclipsing binaries .",
    "the light curves are publically available from http://bulge.princeton.edu/@xmath2ogle/. we describe an automated light curve fitting procedure and carry out solutions for detached ogle smc binaries .",
    "our primary aim is to select detached systems that are most suitable for distance determination .",
    "semi - detached and over - contact eclipsing binaries in the smc will be discussed in a subsequent paper .",
    "this work is a first step toward an eclipsing binary fitting pipeline with a realistic and physically motivated model .",
    "[ fitting_scheme ] discusses our automated fitting scheme . in sec .",
    "[ mocksec ] we display light curve fits to simulated eclipsing binary catalogs in order to gauge reliability .",
    "[ oglesec ] discusses two lists of the best detached candidates for distance determination selected from the ogle catalog .",
    "these lists are compared with the subjective list compiled by udalski et al .",
    "we also list solutions for the 57 candidate ogle systems .",
    "we use a public program ( wilson & devinney 1971 ; wilson 1979 , 1990 , 1998 ) that , in its distributed form , requires user interaction at every iteration .",
    "this lack of automation is a way to force users to examine the progress of a solution .",
    "however , while detailed fits to individual eclipsing binaries should be carried out interactively , the large number of systems ( 1459 ) investigated here makes continual interaction impractical .",
    "we have therefore constructed an automated version of the differential corrections program .      the fortran program _ lc.f _ produces a light curve from input parameters , while _",
    "dc.f _ improves a solution and estimates parameter uncertainties using the method of differential corrections .",
    "our implementation of automation is via a shell script written in perl that executes _ dc _ , as well as a number of auxiliary programs that create and update the input for _ dc _ , test for solution convergence , and create output using _",
    "lc_. while other methods might be faster , this approach allows _",
    "dc.f _ to remain virtually unaltered .",
    "future additions to _ dc _ can therefore be easily incorporated .",
    "the several morphological types of binary ( _ i.e. _ detached , semi - detached , etc . )",
    "are handled by corresponding operational modes of _ lc _ and _ dc_. the perl script attempts to fit each object in mode 2 , which is for detached systems .",
    "initial parameter guesses are taken from a large pre - calculated library of eclipsing binary light curves .",
    "this is efficient , given the large number of objects .",
    "a best fit is first found for each library curve by adjusting the initial epoch , @xmath3 .",
    "we assume the period determined by udalski et al .",
    "the library curve with the closest fit is then used as the initial guess ( with luminosities scaled appropriately ) .",
    "we feel this to be a better approach than attempting to estimate the parameters from eclipse widths , positions , and depths , due to the relatively noisy data .",
    "the method of multiple subsets ( wilson & biermann 1976 ) and the marquardt algorithm ( marquardt 1963 ; levenberg 1944 ) with @xmath4 were used to improve convergence .",
    "our implementation proceeds from the initial guess via sequential iterations , each consisting of an execution of _ dc _ for each of the 3 parameter subsets ( parameters are updated after each subset run ) , followed by an execution with the whole parameter set ( for the estimation of standard errors ) .",
    "convergence is defined to have been achieved if parameter adjustments from each of the individual subset runs are smaller than 0.2 times the standard errors ( calculated from running _ dc _ on the full parameter set ) .",
    "two groups of subsets are defined .",
    "if the solution fails to converge or moves to an unphysical region of parameter space with the first group , the iteration is terminated and convergence is sought from the initial guess for the second group .",
    "we demand that convergence be achieved only for the parameters corresponding to the surface potentials ( @xmath5 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath6 ) , luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , and inclination ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we found that eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) and initial epoch were often much slower to converge by this criterion ( though their adjustments are very small ) .",
    "these convergence criteria are relatively weak , but adequate for the present problem ( see sec .",
    "[ mocksec ] ) .",

    "star 1 is defined to be the star at superior conjunction near phase zero , with the phasing arranged so that it is the one with the deeper eclipse . using _",
    "dc _ in mode 2 for detached binaries we find the surface potentials of stars 1 and 2 , the orbital inclination , the temperature of star 1 ( the temperature of star 2 is fixed ) , the orbital eccentricity , the luminosity of star 1 ( the luminosity of star 2 is set by the other parameters ) , and an epoch of zero phase .",
    "since we do not know the temperatures , we use _ dc _ with the black body approximation .",
    "we assume 10000 k for the temperature of star 2 ( arbitrary choice ) and a logarithmic limb darkening law .",
    "explicitly ( e.g. van hamme 1993 ) this law is written @xmath10 where @xmath11 is @xmath12 at a given surface point in a direction @xmath13 with the normal .",

    "( 1998 ) , the stars are expected to be primarily of o and b type .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively for both stars .",
    "the values are from van hamme 1993 for i - band , with an effective temperature of 15000k and @xmath19 of 4.5 ( _ cgs _ ) .",
    "we use the simple reflection model ( wilson , 1990 ) , with a single reflection ( mref=1 , nref=1 ) , and assume the stars have no spots .",
    "we also assume synchronous rotation , that bolometric flux is proportional to surface gravity , and a bolometric albedo of 1 . the scatter of observations is assumed to scale with the square root of the flux level ( parameter noise=1 in _ dc _ ) .",
    "we assume that the initial argument of periastron , @xmath20 , for star 1 ( in radians ) is constant in time , and that it takes a value of either 0 or @xmath21 .",
    "this choice introduces systematic error into the solution for eccentricity and therefore into the stellar radii , and is particularly problematic where @xmath22 .",
    "however the recovered eccentricity ( and hence the radii ) will be reasonable approximations in most cases since if @xmath20 is distributed randomly , then for inclinations of 90 degrees , the projected position of periastron on the sky is distributed as @xmath23 ( the results of the following section quantify this assertion ) .",
    "the mass ratio is assumed to be @xmath24 , a choice that should be unimportant for well detached systems .",
    "there is an inherent ambiguity in partially eclipsing light curve fits between the radii of stars 1 and 2 .",
    "that ambiguity may extend to complete eclipses for noisy light curves . when computing the library of light curve guesses , we assume that the hotter star ( star 1 ) is larger , a choice that effectively restricts our solutions .",
    "we note that significantly evolved stars may not obey this condition",
    ". however the physically correct solution ( which is essential for distance determination ) will not usually be determined from photometry alone .",
    "the ambiguity must be resolved on a case by case basis with help from spectra .",
    "importantly , the computation of a degenerate solution does not affect the selection of a particular binary as a potential distance indicator .",
    "tests revealed that the ogle systems typically have third - light consistent with zero , and we have accordingly set third light to zero in our photometric solutions .",

    "[ tab01 ] lists the two groups of subsets .",
    "in this section we apply our light curve fitting algorithm to two simulated catalogs of eclipsing binaries . the first contains only detached binaries , while the other comprises semi - detached and over - contact systems .",
    "there are three objectives : 1 ) to quantify the applicability of the error estimates produced by _",
    "dc _ , 2 ) to estimate the extent of the systematic error introduced by the assumption of fixed values for limb darkening coefficients , mass ratio , and argument of periastron , and 3 ) to estimate the success rate in finding good distance indicators .",
    "we generated 100 simulated detached eclipsing binaries having 150 randomly spaced observations ( typical for ogle eclipsing binaries ) and gaussian noise that scaled as square root of light with a level of @xmath25 at the light curve mean .",
    "these systems have temperatures for star 2 of 15000k and for star 1 of between 15000k and 30000k .",
    "the temperature for star 2 differs from that assumed for real stars .",
    "we deliberately fit the wrong temperature to highlight the point that , although we do not know the temperatures of the real stars , the surface brightness ratio is the important quantity .",
    "the light curves were computed with logarithmic limb darkening coefficients corresponding to the temperatures ( van hamme , 1993 ) .",
    "the mass ratios ranged between 0.5 and 1 , and @xmath20 was randomly distributed .",
    "the simulated binaries were produced with assorted stellar potentials , orbital eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "[ test_lc ] shows examples of the simulated light curve data , as well as computed light curves and residuals obtained with the fitting algorithm outlined in sec .",
    "[ fitting_scheme ] .",
    "our algorithm found a converged solution with residuals comparable to the scatter for 95% of cases .",

    "the plot demonstrates that the fitting scheme does an excellent job of recovering input model radii , and that the errors provide a good description of solution accuracy ( including systematic uncertainty ) .",
    "this is further demonstrated by the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ test1 ] that show @xmath32 plotted against the absolute size of the error @xmath30 .",
    "naturally there is some tendency for the solutions with larger errors to be closer ( in units of standard error ) to the correct value .",
    "however the errors are surprisingly normal over the full range of error sizes , and do not exhibit a large tail .",
    "[ test2 ] shows the solution values ( with standard errors ) plotted against simulated values for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , surface brightness ratio ( @xmath35 ) , luminosity ratio ( @xmath36 ) , inclination , and eccentricity .",
    "the sum of radii is very accurately reproduced , while the surface brightness ratio is also reliably recovered . for surface brightness ratios near 1",
    ", the solution has a relatively small uncertainty , although the standard errors are realistic over the range . while the inclination is not recovered accurately , the standard errors are again representative .",
    "however significant error is clearly present in some solutions for the ratio of radii , and the ratio of luminosities for some systems .",
    "the eccentricity is often not recovered , and has unrealistic standard errors because the error is completely dominated by the systematic error introduced by the assumption that @xmath20 is @xmath37 or @xmath21 .",
    "the fitted eccentricity is a lower limit .",
    "the relatively large uncertainties in the ratio of radii and inclination can be traced to the following : in the case of partial eclipses , a change in the ratio of radii can nearly be compensated ( with regard to eclipse depth ) by a change in inclination , so there is a near - degeneracy between the ratio of radii and the inclination .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken if the eclipses are complete , and we thus expect smaller errors for the individual radii in these cases . turning this around , solutions with small relative errors in the radii can therefore be used to determine whether a binary is completely eclipsed .",
    "we define the quantity : @xmath38 which is greater than 1 for systems with complete eclipse ( strictly true only for spherical stars , but nearly true otherwise ) . here",

    "due to the large uncertainties in inclination and ratio of radii , the solution @xmath40 s are also very uncertain .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ eclipse_test ] shows the number of standard errors ( @xmath41 ) by which the solution for @xmath40 differs from its correct value plotted against the absolute size of the error .",

    "cases where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are denoted by larger dots and have their standard error bars shown ( left panel ) .",
    "the solutions for this subset of systems recover @xmath40 ( sometimes accurately ) with realistic standard errors .",
    "since many of the ogle binaries are not detached , simulated catalogs of semi - detached ( mode 5 ) and over - contact ( mode 1 ) binaries were produced by applying noise and sampling to model light curves as before . in the case of semi - detached binaries",
    "the potential of star 2 was fixed by the mass ratio .",
    "for the over - contact binaries the potential of star 2 was equal to the potential of star 1 .",
    "our detached binary fitting algorithm was unable to converge to a solution for any of the over - contact systems .",
    "this failure is expected and is a consequence firstly of the fact that the over - contact light curve geometry can not typically be produced from a detached system , and secondly that we have assumed @xmath44 . whilst the assumption of @xmath44 is reasonable when discussing detached systems , over - contact binaries have light curves that are sensitive to @xmath45 , which is nearly always far from 1 .",
    "however detached solutions were found for about two thirds of semi - detached binaries ( the somewhat low success rate can again be traced to the fixed @xmath45 ) . because the simulated semi - detached catalog was produced in mode 5",
    ", the cooler star ( star 2 ) fills its critical lobe .",
    "the radius is therefore typically larger for star 2 than for star 1 .",
    "however our procedure provides an initial guess having a radius that is larger for star 1 than for star 2 .",
    "solutions can be nearly ambiguous between cases where the radii but not the temperatures are interchanged . since star 1 is defined to be hotter and we start from an assumption that @xmath46 , we may find this alternate ( incorrect ) solution for many sd systems when they are solved as detached .",
    "importantly , where a fit is obtained the sum of the radii and the surface brightness ratio are recovered accurately , and with realistic errors . over - contact and semi - detached systems should therefore not contaminate our selection of well detached distance indicators .    in summary",
    ", we find the following : the assumption of an @xmath20 that is either 0 or @xmath21 radians can introduce significant systematic error into the solution for eccentricity .",
    "the resulting systematic contributions to the errors in radii from the limb darkening , argument of periastron and the uncertainty in surface brightness ratio often render the solution for luminosity ratio incorrect , and with unrealistically small error bars .",
    "however the @xmath47 s , their sum , and the surface brightness ratio are reliably reproduced .",
    "furthermore , solutions having a small relative error in both radii accurately determine @xmath40 , and therefore whether the binary undergoes total eclipse .",
    "we next applied our algorithm to the ogle smc eclipsing binary catalog .",
    "we obtained solutions for @xmath48 of binaries .",
    "given our high success rate on the simulated catalogs , we infer that the remaining @xmath49 are predominantly in semi - detached or over - contact condition .",
    "another possibility is that some of the un - fitted systems have mass ratios very different from 1 , with one star having a normalized radius greater than one half .",
    "not all our detached solutions necessarily imply a detached system . due to the typical noise levels , a detached solution with @xmath44",
    "may be found for a semi - detached light curve having @xmath50 . however , these systems will have at least one large component .",
    "the ogle smc eclipsing binary catalog has 68 objects that are in two overlapping fields . as a check we found solutions for these objects using both data sets . in these cases",
    "we find consistent solutions .",
    "figure  [ obs_fits ] shows 27 examples ( from ogle field smc - sc2 ) of light curve fits and residuals , as well as 3 examples where no solution was found because an iteration moved outside the physical bounds of the @xmath44 detached system .",

    "we have quantitatively selected two catalogs of objects that should be particularly reliable distance indicators :      the first catalog is composed of systems having a small and well determined @xmath54 , similar temperatures , and deep eclipses .",
