    "while the standard model successfully describes the gauge interactions of quarks and leptons , the origin of fermion masses and mixing angles is not yet understood .",
    "the standard model treats these quantities as free parameters , namely the coupling constants of yukawa interactions . in the three - generation framework ,",
    "yukawa couplings are given by complex @xmath0 matrices in the generation space .",
    "a natural way to remedy the problem is to assume that some physics at high - energy scale dynamically controls yukawa couplings and brings us the observed patterns of masses and mixing angles .    along this line",
    ", various forms of yukawa matrices have been discussed in the literature both for quarks and leptons . for the quark sector ,",
    "possible small numbers of non - vanishing matrix elements have been examined  @xcite whether they are consistent with the experimental results , and the obtained forms of matrices have provided us clues to find symmetry or dynamics behind the yukawa interactions .",
    "there have also been many studies about possible non - vanishing elements of lepton yukawa matrices .",
    "in particular , neutrino mass matrices are classified from various standpoints  @xcite and that gives new insights about neutrino models to produce the observed data .",
    "simultaneous treatments of quark and lepton yukawa matrices lead to the investigations in unified theory based on the gauge groups such as @xmath1  @xcite , @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "an interesting point of unified theory is that the unification of standard model gauge groups implies non - trivial relations among various coupling constants including yukawa couplings .",
    "the cerebrated bottom / tau unification  @xcite and other theoretical predictions for masses and mixing angles  @xcite suggest that the unification hypothesis might provide us a deeper understanding of yukawa matrices .",
    "the recent experimental data on fermion masses and mixing angles , however , gives us some questions about the unification hypothesis .",
    "in particular , the neutrino oscillation experiments have been bringing out the structure of leptonic generation mixing which indicates some kind of quark - lepton asymmetry , that is , large lepton mixing against small quark mixing . in the light of quark - lepton unification , that seems somewhat unnatural since the generation structure of quarks",
    "is often correlated to that of leptons in unified theory .",
    "a possible solution to avoid such an intuitive result is to assume fermion mass matrices which are non - symmetric in the generation space  @xcite .",
    "this idea may have dynamical verification , e.g.  in @xmath2 unification where right - handed down - type quarks are combined with left - handed charged leptons .",
    "consequently , since their mass matrices are generally left - right asymmetric , large leptonic mixing is derived without disturbing quark mixing angles , and can be consistent with unified gauge symmetry .",
    "given this fact , it is meaningful to explore general , not necessarily symmetric , forms of mass ( yukawa ) matrices for quarks and leptons including the neutrino sector .",
    "with a throughout analysis in the light of the recent experimental data of quarks as well as leptons , new insights into the origin of generation structure are expected to be obtained .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed in detail the quark sector where the down - quark mass matrices are of asymmetrical forms . based on the minimality principle ,",
    "namely with the smallest number of non - vanishing matrix elements , we have found 6 patterns of up and down - quark matrices which are entirely accommodated to the observed values of quark mass and mixing parameters . in addition , they are capable of leading to large leptonic mixing via @xmath2 relation . in this paper",
    ", we complete the analysis by exploring lepton ( neutrino ) mass matrices with the minimal number of independent mass matrix elements .",
    "we consider two types of schemes for neutrino masses .",
    "the first is to analyze light majorana masses of the three - generation left - handed neutrinos , that is , @xmath5 majorana mass matrices .",
    "the second scheme introduces three right - handed neutrinos which have large majorana masses and also dirac masses with the left - handed ones . in this scheme ,",
    "we are lead to simultaneously analyze the minimality of dirac and majorana mass matrices",
    ". the purposes of this paper are to present the simplest forms of lepton mass matrices with which the 6 quark mass textures previously found are compatible and also to study some phenomenology related to the obtained forms of lepton mass matrices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the standard form of yukawa interactions of quarks and leptons , and introduce several parameters and their experimental values needed in later analysis . in section 3",
    ", we revisit the quark mass textures found in the previous work to examine the discrepancy between down - type quarks and charged leptons , especially for the first and second generations . based on these results ,",
    "the minimality is explored for two types of neutrino mass models ; majorana mass matrices of left - handed neutrinos ( in section 4 ) and dirac and majorana masses introducing right - handed neutrinos ( in section 5 ) .",
    "section 6 is devoted to analyzing some phenomenological issues of the lepton mass textures found in the previous sections .",
    "section 7 summarizes our results .",
    "we first present the standard - model formulation of yukawa interactions for quarks and leptons and the observed values of mass and mixing parameters , which are used as input parameters .",
    "the yukawa terms invariant under the standard - model gauge transformations are given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the electroweak doublets of left - handed quarks and leptons , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the right - handed up - type quarks , down - type quarks and charged leptons , respectively .",
    "the yukawa coupling constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are complex - valued @xmath0 matrices ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are generation indices running over 1 to 3 ) , and @xmath19 is the higgs doublet .",
    "there is no renormalizable yukawa term for neutrinos in the standard model .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , these yukawa interactions lead to the following quark and lepton mass terms : @xmath20    \\quad ( m_u)_{ij}=(y_u)_{ij}v , \\qquad ( m_d)_{ij}=(y_d)_{ij}v ,    \\qquad ( m_e)_{ij}=(y_e)_{ij } v , \\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of higgs scalar @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the above mass terms for charged fermions , one may consider majorana mass term for left - handed neutrinos , taking into account the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "that is parametrized as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the majorana mass matrix is generally complex - valued and has a symmetry property @xmath24 . throughout this paper , we assume that light neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the generation mixings are described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite for quarks and the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix  @xcite for leptons , each of which consists of two unitary matrices @xmath25 these unitary matrices diagonalize the mass matrices of quarks and leptons as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unitary matrices which can be removed by unitary rotations of right - handed fermions .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 correspond to the experimentally observed mass eigenvalues ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively , where all the eigenvalues are made real and positive . as for the neutrino masses , @xmath36 and",
    "the squared mass differences are defined as @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , which are the observables in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the current masses for quarks and charged leptons at the @xmath39-boson mass scale are evaluated including various effects such as qcd coupling effects  @xcite @xmath40 in gev unit . for the charged lepton masses",
    ", we have neglected errors and will refer to the above fixed values because the errors of charged lepton masses are very small and do not affect the analysis of mass matrix forms .",
    "the physical mixing parameters in the quark sector are 3 mixing angles and 1 complex phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "the measured magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements are  @xcite @xmath41 from various observations of cp - violating processes in the quark sector , the rephasing - invariant measure of cp violation  @xcite is given by @xmath42 in addition , the experimental study of the @xmath43-meson decay to charmoniums indicates  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is one of the angles of the unitary triangle for the @xmath43-meson system which is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "the physical mixing parameters in the lepton sector are 3 mixing angles and 3 complex phases in the mns matrix for majorana neutrinos . we use the following parametrization for the mixing matrix : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the cp - violating dirac phase . the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the majorana phases , which are irrelevant to neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "in general , a @xmath0 unitary matrix contains 3 rotation angles and 6 complex phases , and a redefinition of lepton fields can remove 3 complex phases .",
    "therefore the above parametrization covers the most general mixing matrix in the case that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the information on the first and second generation neutrinos is extracted , e.g.  from the solar neutrino experiments  @xcite and the kamland reactor anti - neutrino experiment  @xcite .",
    "the super - kamiokande experiment  @xcite , the k2k long - baseline experiment  @xcite and the chooz reactor experiment  @xcite probe the energy region @xmath53  ev and bring out the information including the third generation neutrino .",
    "recent global analyses taking into account three - generation effects suggest  @xcite @xmath54 at the @xmath55 level .",
    "one interesting observation is that the best fit value of the atmospheric angle @xmath56 is the maximal one ( @xmath57 ) , while the maximal mixture of the solar neutrinos is disfavored more than the @xmath58 level  @xcite . as will be seen in later sections , the significant deviation of the solar angle @xmath59 from the maximal one plays an important role to search for the minimal forms of neutrino mass textures .",
    "before proceeding to the analysis of neutrino sector , we discuss the charged lepton mass matrix in unified theory based on the minimal quark mass matrices previously found .",
    "it turns out below that the minimal form of charged - fermion mass matrices is uniquely determined if one takes into account the discrepancy in mass eigenvalues between down - type quarks and charged leptons . in this section , after briefly reviewing the minimal forms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we examine a way to understand such discrepancy with group - theoretical factors in unified theory .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we systematically investigated the minimality of quark mass matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 , including the case that @xmath61 is non - symmetric in the generation space . here",
    "the term `` minimality '' means that the mass matrices successfully describe the experimental data with as few numbers of non - vanishing elements as possible . in other words , we have searched for the maximal number of vanishing matrix elements such that they are consistent with the observations . it is noted that the number of zero elements is that of independently - vanishing elements in each matrix .",
    "for example , for a symmetric matrix , `` 1 zero '' implies that a diagonal element or a pair of off - diagonal elements in symmetric positions takes a negligibly small value compared to the others .",
