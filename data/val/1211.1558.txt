    "different theories of quantum gravity particularly string theory and loop quantum gravity predict the thermal nature of black hole horizons @xcite . these theories confirm the semi - classical results of bekenstein and hawking about the evaporation of black holes as a result of emission of charged particles @xcite . in the early seventies , it was found that laws of thermodynamics are applicable to black holes horizons by defining new quantities like entropy ( @xmath3 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "hence the laws of thermodynamics for black holes arise from the geometry of spacetime . more recently in the last few years",
    ", several new connections between geometry / gravity and thermodynamics have been found .",
    "jacobson found a link between the einstein equation and the thermal relation @xmath5 , where left hand side represents the energy flux @xcite ( see excellent reviews on connections between gravity and thermodynamics @xcite ) .",
    "later it was proved that the thermodynamics of black holes is also valid for cosmological horizons @xcite and the friedmann equation can be written as a first law of thermodynamics @xcite . while more recently it is proposed by verlinde that gravity has an entropic origin and newton s law of gravitation",
    "arises naturally and unavoidably in a theory in which space is emergent through a holographic scenario @xcite .",
    "wormholes are tunnels in spacetime geometry that connect two or more regions of the same spacetime or two different spacetimes @xcite .",
    "wormholes are classified in two categories : euclidean wormholes that arise in euclidean quantum gravity and the lorentzian wormholes which are static spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s general relativistic field equations @xcite .",
    "interest in lorentzian wormholes arose in order to make them useful for time travel for human beings , hence termed time machines in popular literature @xcite . in order to support such exotic wormhole geometries , the matter required to stabilize them has to be exotic i.e. violating the energy conditions ( null , weak and strong ) , however it has been shown that averaged null energy condition is satisfied in wormhole geometries @xcite .",
    "also the violation of weak energy condition ( wec ) can be avoided for small intervals of time @xcite .",
    "more recently traversable wormhole and time machine solutions of the field equations of an alternative of gravity with non - minimally curvature - matter coupling have been obtained @xcite .",
    "wormholes have been constructed in some alternative theories of gravity including @xmath6 , teleparallel , kaluza - klein , loop quantum gravity , brans - dicke gravity and lovelock gravities , to name a few @xcite and is found that modified gravity can minimize the amount of anisotropy and exotic matter required to support the existence of wormhole s throat .",
    "kar & sahdev had shown that if the wormhole spacetime is taken to be evolving ( non - static ) than the matter threading the wormhole geometry need not to be wec violating @xcite . in their model , the wormhole initially inflates and later evolves like a frw spacetime thereby implying our universe to be an evolving wormhole .",
    "later anchordoqui et al @xcite extended the previous work @xcite by choosing the non - zero redshift function and obtained evolving wormhole solutions with non - exotic matter .",
    "arellano & lobo @xcite found contracting wormhole solutions within non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "cataldo et al discussed the construction of evolving wormholes using phantom energy @xcite and more recently using the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "farooq et al @xcite showed that the field equations of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional evolving wormhole can be recast into first law of thermodynamics .",
    "debnath et al @xcite investigated the non - static lorentzian wormhole model in presence of anisotropic pressure and showed that the einstein s field equations and unified first law are equivalent for the dynamical wormhole model .",
    "inspired by the above works , we are interested to study the thermodynamics of an evolving wormhole at its apparent horizon using general entropy function and two special entropy functions , to be discussed later .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we write down the governing dynamical equations of an evolving wormhole .",
    "the previous work of rahaman et al @xcite has some computational errors for wormhole thermodynamics in presence of isotropic pressure . in this work",
    ", we correct these assigning with anisotropic pressure in the field equations . in section - iii",
    ", we study the wormhole thermodynamics by deriving the expressions of temperature , entropy and surface gravity at the apparent horizon of the wormhole .",
    "further we obtain the general expression of the gsl at the apparent horizon valid for any type of entropy function chosen . in section iv , we study the expression of gsl by choosing two well - known forms of entropy functions i.e. log corrected and the power - law corrected in two forthcoming subsections .",
    "we analyze the behavior of gsl by choosing a power - law form of scale factor .",
    "we briefly discuss our results in section v.",
    "a simple generalization of morris - thorne ( mt ) wormhole to the time - dependent background is given by the evolving lorentzian wormhole @xcite @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the scale factor of the universe . the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are called the shape function and redshift function respectively . earlier the evolving wormholes have been studied with time - independent redshift function @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath13 constant and @xmath14 , then the static mt wormhole can be obtained whereas for @xmath15 and @xmath16 constant , eq ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to standard frw metric .    for anisotropic pressure",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor are @xcite assumed as @xmath17 where , the traditionally homogeneous and isotropic exotic matter source has been generalized to an inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid , but still with a diagonal energy - momentum tensor ( as is usually considered in phantom cosmologies ) .",
    "here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy density , radial and tangential pressures respectively .",
    "the einstein s field equations are then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hubble parameter . here",
    "dot and dash stand for the differentiation with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . from eqn ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we have @xmath25 .",
    "so without any loss of generality , we can set @xmath26 by re - scaling the time coordinate @xcite . then the field eqns change to @xmath27 from eqns ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath28 also , from the conservation of energy equation , we get @xmath29 @xmath30 for isotropic pressure , @xmath31 and hence from eqn ( [ 12 ] ) , @xmath32 i.e , @xmath33 becomes a function of time only .",
    "also eqn ( [ 10 ] ) shows @xmath34 and thus the metric ( [ 1 ] ) becomes frw metric . to avoid this structure",
    ", we must require matter with anisotropic pressure which automatically leads to inhomogeneity .",
    "some basic laws of wormhole dynamics have been derived in @xcite , which suggest a genuine connection with thermodynamics .",
    "ever since , the thermal properties of wormholes have been studied in literature @xcite . for studying the generalized second law of thermodynamics for an evolving wormhole ,",
    "let us consider the metric ( [ 1 ] ) as in the following form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the physical radius @xmath37 .",

    "then @xmath48 then from ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , we may write @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , for anisotropic pressure the gibb s equation can be defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the entropy within the ah and @xmath52 .",
    "so , it can be shown that @xmath53 thus from ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , the variation of total entropy on the ah can be expressed as @xmath54\\nonumber\\\\&&+\\frac{4\\pi\\tilde{r}_{a}^{2}}{3}\\big(3\\rho+p_{r}+2p_{t } + \\frac{\\tilde{r}_{a}\\rho'}{a}\\big)\\nonumber\\\\&&\\times\\big(\\dot{\\tilde{r}}_{a}-h\\tilde{r}_{a}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath55 i.e. , if the expression of the r.h.s of above equation is non - negative , then we say that gsl is valid .",
    "for this purpose we need to know the entropy function @xmath47 and the shape function @xmath10 . +",
    "here we choose a particular form of the shape function as @xmath1 , @xmath56  constant , in order to study the gslt for two different types of wormhole models by choosing two specific forms of the horizon entropy @xmath57 i.e. , logarithmic and power law correction entropies .",
    "it is a well - known fact that in einstein s gravity , the entropy of the horizon is proportional to the area , but when the gravity theory is modified by adding extra curvature terms in the action , it also modifies the entropy - area relation . in the context of loop - quantum gravity , this relation can be expanded into an infinite series as @xcite @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the classical entropy and the higher order terms are quantum corrections . here @xmath60 s are finite constants , but their values are highly debatable .",
    "for example , some take the value of @xmath61 to be negative @xcite , some positive @xcite , whereas some have taken it to be zero @xcite .",
    "this correction has been used in literature for variety of purposes : to study the dark energy models in numerous gravities @xcite , to unify inflation and dark energy models @xcite , study of gsl with log corrections @xcite .",
    "+ from eq ( [ 26 ] ) , we continue our study by considering the expression of the horizon entropy with the logarithmic correction only @xcite , i.e , for our study @xmath62 so that the entropy function can be written as @xmath63    with this choice of entropy , eqn ( [ 25 ] ) takes the form @xmath64\\\\ & & -\\frac{h\\tilde{r}_{a}^{7}}{3g}\\big(\\frac{a^{2}b_{0}}{\\tilde{r}_{a}^{4 } } -3\\dot{h}\\big)\\big(\\frac{h^{2}+\\dot{h}}{h^{2}\\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}-a^{2}b_{0}}\\big),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the field equations and eqn ( [ 16 ] ) for the expressions of @xmath65 , @xmath33 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . + for a special choice of the scale factor in power law form which is assumed as @xmath68 .",
    "now , we plot the evolution of the total entropy on the ah against time in figure 1 , where the constant @xmath2 has been taken to be equal to @xmath69 ( solid line ) and @xmath70 ( dashed line ) , we see that the gsl is valid for small @xmath2 but as @xmath2 increases , gsl is not obeyed in the later epoch for logarithmic corrected entropy .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath71 ( dashed line ) . ]      another significant correction term to the horizon entropy expression appeared while dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields inside and outside of the horizon where the wave function of the field is chosen to be a superposition of ground state and excited state @xcite .",
    "so the associated power law corrected entropy expression becomes @xcite @xmath72 so that in this case we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 here @xmath77 is called the cross - over scale .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the ground state obeys the usual area law whereas the excited state contributes to the correction .",
    "thus the correction term is more significant for higher excitations .",
    "it is important to note that the correction term falls off rapidly as @xmath78 increases and hence in the semi classical limit ( large @xmath78 ) , the area law can be recovered .",
    "this correction has been recently used extensively in dark energy literature : to study the holographic and new - agegraphic dark energy in various gravitational theories @xcite and the study of gsl in frw cosmology with power - law entropy correction @xcite .    for",
    "this choice of the horizon entropy , eqn ( 25 ) becomes @xmath79\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big(\\frac{a^{2}b_{0}+\\dot{h}\\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}}{h^{2}\\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}-a^{2}b_{0}}\\big ) \\big[\\frac{a^{2}b_{0}}{\\tilde{r}_{a}^{2}}-\\tilde{r}_{a}^{2}(\\dot{h}+2h^{2})\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{h\\tilde{r}_{a}^{7}}{3g}\\big(\\frac{a^{2}b_{0}}{\\tilde{r}_{a}^{4 } } -3\\dot{h}\\big)\\big(\\frac{h^{2}+\\dot{h}}{h^{2}\\tilde{r}_{a}^{4}-a^{2}b_{0}}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here also the field equations together with eqn ( [ 16 ] ) have been used to write the expressions of @xmath65 , @xmath33 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "for a special choice of the scale factor in power law form which is assumed as @xmath68 .",
    "now , we plot the evolution of the total entropy on the ah against time in figure 2 , where the constant @xmath2 has been taken to be equal to @xmath69 ( solid line ) and @xmath70 ( dashed line ) , we see that the gsl is valid for small @xmath2 but as @xmath2 increases , gsl is not obeyed in the later epoch for power law corrected entropy .",
