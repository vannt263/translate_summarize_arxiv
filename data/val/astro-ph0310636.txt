    "the ultrahigh energy neutrino physics has attracted a lot of attention during last couple of years .",
    "neutrinos are important messengers of information on distant extragalactic sources in the universe and the neutrino astronomy has many advantages over the conventional photon astronomy .",
    "first of all , neutrinos , unlike photons , interact only weakly , so they can travel long distances being practically undisturbed .",
    "the typical interaction lengths for the neutrino and the photon at energy @xmath0 are about @xmath1 thus very energetic photons with energy bigger than @xmath2 can not reach the earth from the very distant corners of our universe without being rescattered . on the other hand neutrinos can travel very long distances and are also not deflected by galactic magnetic fields .    at ultrahigh energies",
    "the angular distortion of the neutrino is very small .",
    "typically the angle between the neutrino and the produced muon is about @xmath3 therefore the highly energetic neutrinos point back to their sources .",
    "the interest in the neutrinos at these high energies lead to the development of the experimental devices such as amanda @xcite , nestor @xcite , antares @xcite or planned ice cube @xcite observatories . for the reliable observation of the neutrinos",
    ", their cross sections and production rates in hadronic matter have to be well known .",
    "even though the neutrinos interact only weakly with other particles , strong interactions play an essential role in the calculations of the neutrino production rates and their interaction cross section .",
    "this is due to the fact that neutrinos are coming from the decays of various mesons such as @xmath4 and even @xmath5 which are produced in the high energy proton - proton ( or proton - nucleus , nucleus - nucleus ) collisions .",
    "these hadronic processes occur mainly in the atmosphere though possibly can be also present in the accretion disc in the remote active galactic nuclei . also , the interactions of highly energetic neutrinos with matter are dominated by the deep inelastic cross section with the nucleons / nuclei as described in sec .  4 .",
    "this is why the knowledge about qcd from high energy collider experiments such as hera and tevatron is invaluable .",
    "the production and interaction of highly energetic neutrinos with nucleons involves gluon distribution probed at very small values of bjorken variable @xmath6 which corresponds to a very high c.m.s . energy .",
    "this is the kinematic domain which is currently inaccessible in these colliders ( at hera the minimal @xmath7 at @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the virtuality of the photonic probe ) , and this calls for a reliable extrapolation of parton densities constrained by the current experimental data . in this review",
    "we concentrate mainly on the application of the knowledge and experience gained in testing high energy qcd at present colliders to the problem of precise evaluation of the neutrino - nucleon ( or nucleus ) scattering cross sections .",
    "in addition , the production rate for the atmospheric neutrino flux from the charm or beauty decays ( the so called prompt neutrino flux ) will be analyzed .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in the next section we briefly discuss the origin of the ultrahigh energetic neutrinos . in sec .  3 we describe the mechanism of the prompt neutrino production at high energies in the atmosphere and present the calculation of the cross section using different models for the small @xmath10 dynamics , including parton shadowing .",
    "we then follow the sequence of fragmentation , interaction and decays of the charmed mesons to obtain the neutrino fluxes at high energies . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the interaction of the neutrinos with the nucleons and in particular we evaluate the deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon cross section based on the various parametrisations of the parton distribution functions . in sec .  5",
    "we follow the process of the neutrino transport through the earth and present the angular dependence of the fluxes after travelling through the matter . also in sec .",
    "5.1 we discuss the effect of the @xmath11 regeneration . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the effects of the neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are various sources of ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes .",
    "the currently measured @xcite ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is the atmospheric one which results from interactions of cosmic rays with the nuclei in the atmosphere .",
    "it is rather steeply falling flux @xmath12 , however it will have the large energy tail due to the charm production which will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "there are several predictions for the ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes other than the atmospheric one , most of them differ by orders of magnitude . for the detailed review on the possible ultrahigh neutrino sources",
    "see for example @xcite and the recent constraints on the ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes have been given in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review the possible sources of ultrahigh energy neutrinos .",
    "one can expect a contribution to the galactic flux resulting from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium , and the extragalactic flux which originates from the @xmath13 interactions of cosmic rays with intracluster gas in the galaxy clusters . at the very high energies one can also expect cosmogenic neutrino flux coming from the interactions of the highest energy cosmic rays with the ubiquitous photons from cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "an interesting possible source of the ultrahigh energy neutrinos are the active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "these are highly luminous objects , which luminosity from the nucleus reaches or exceeds that of our milky way galaxy @xmath14 .",
    "the energy of the agn comes from gravitational energy of a supermassive black hole in the center of the nucleus with mass @xmath15 .",
    "the matter accrets onto a disc which surrounds a black hole , and the hot gas from inner parts of the disc can move away from it and get squeezed by the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to the emergence of highly luminous jets which can extend over the distance of @xmath16 .",
    "there are different classes of agns like seyfert , blasars and quasars .",
    "most probably they are similar objects but with just a different orientation towards the earth .",
    "the production of the neutrinos occurs through the reaction of @xmath17 with subsequent decay of the pion .",
    "protons can be accelerated in the accretion disc and interact there with the photons , or in the jets where they can interact with the synchrotron radiation photons .",
    "the shock acceleration has been proposed as a most plausible mechanism for the acceleration in agns ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "gamma ray bursts which are characterised by the intense and short - time photon spectra can also be considered as a possible source of neutrino flux .",
    "the detailed origin of grb is not known , though most probably they are very massive hypernovae @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of grb is modelled via expanding relativistic fireball .",
    "if the protons are also shock accelerated they might interact with the synchrotron photons to produce neutrinos via pion photo - production @xcite .",
    "supernovae are powerful sources of the neutrinos and gamma - rays at nuclear energies . though , there has been no evidence for the high - energy gamma ray or neutrinos fluxes from supernova sn1987a , it is possible that supernovae could be sources of the highly energetic neutrinos .",
    "other , more exotic mechanisms are also studied . in particular the annihilation of weakly interacting particles ( wimps ) trapped in the cores of sun or the earth @xcite .",
    "wimps have been discussed in the context of the dark matter component of the universe . using the predicted density for the dark matter one can estimate the flux of neutrinos which would come from the process of wimps annihilation .",
    "for example within the supersymmetric scenario annihilation of neutralinos has been proposed as a source for the flux of muon neutrinos @xcite . in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with conserved r - parity neutralino",
    "is the lightest susy particle - lsp and it is stable .",
    "neutralinos could be therefore attractive candidates for the dark matter wimps .",
    "if their density is high enough they could annihilate producing ultrahigh energy neutrino flux in the final state @xcite ( for recent calculation see @xcite ) .",
    "another speculative source are so called top - down models @xcite which assume the existence of the very heavy dark matter particles @xcite - wimpzillas . in various gut models",
    "these heavy particles occur naturally with a mass around the gut scale @xmath18 .",
    "if their lifetime is long enough they would contribute to the cosmic and neutrino flux at very high energies . in some models very heavy particles",
    "are produced continuously from the emission of the topological defects @xcite that are relics of the cosmological phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "for example , during the reheating phase in the early universe the ultraheavy relics can be produced quite copiously and they could be the candidates for the dark matter in the universe .",
    "these supermassive particles with the relatively long lifetime could be concentrated in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "this is very interesting possibility since it could explain the possible excess of the data @xcite beyond the gzk @xcite cutoff : the products of the decays of these wimpzillas would have energies exceeding @xmath19 .",
    "this in consequence would also lead to the enhancement neutrino flux at the ultrahigh energies .",
    "finally , we stress that an important general upper bound on the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux has been derived @xcite from the known cosmic ray flux .",
    "this limit is applicable to the agns and grbs and could only be exceeded through the exotic scenario ( like wimps annihillation or the top - down model ) or if the production source for the cosmic rays is optically thick to proton - photon pion production or proton - nucleon interactions ( so called `` neutrino only factories '' ) .",
    "in this section we study in detail the production of the high - energy neutrinos in the atmosphere .",
    "this neutrino flux constitutes an important background to the flux of cosmic neutrinos discussed in the previous section .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux is produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the nuclei in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos mainly come from the decays of pions and kaons . at energies of around @xmath20 the decay length of these mesons",
    "is so large , that they interact before decaying and loose substantial amount of energy .",
    "this effect leads to the steeply falling spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite @xmath21 at higher energies @xmath22 the atmospheric neutrino flux will be dominated by the prompt neutrino production originating from charm and also beauty hadron decays .",
    "these hadrons ( @xmath23 mesons , barion @xmath24 and their @xmath5 counterparts ) are characterised by a very short lifetime @xmath25 , so up to energies @xmath26 they will not interact before decaying and the flat flux of the neutrinos will be produced which can extend up to these energies .",
    "this prompt neutrino flux at high energies is a background for the sought after cosmic neutrinos and its precise evaluation is essential .",
    "there are several qcd - motivated calculations of the prompt neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "below , we present a particular calculation which includes small @xmath10 resummation effects as well as estimate of the gluon shadowing @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the charm production can be evaluated within perturbative qcd framework .",
    "the high energy regime of the production process @xmath28 probed by the cosmic rays is however not accessible in the present colliders and reliable extrapolations of these predictions are therefore necessary .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] we present the diagram for the charm production in the collision of two protons .",
    "@xmath29 is the feynman variable characterising the fraction of the energy of the incident cosmic ray proton carried by the produced charm quark .",
    "the cross section for the production of the @xmath27 pair in the proton - proton collision reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the partonic cross section for the process @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the gluon density in the proton evaluated at the momentum fraction @xmath10 and the scale @xmath34 . in the domain of high energies that we are interested , the typical momentum fractions are of the order @xmath35 and consequently @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the @xmath27 system .",
    "in general the higher the energy the lower the momentum fraction @xmath38 in question .",
    "it means that in this process the gluon density @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsection ] ) is probed in the regime of @xmath38 which is outside the range of any present accelerator data .",
    "we consider three approaches for an extrapolation into the low @xmath10 region :    * extrapolation of the standard dglap evolution * unifed bfkl / dglap evolution equations * inclusion of saturation effects , golec - biernat and wuesthoff model    we briefly describe these calculations below .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to use the standard gluon distribution obtained within the dglap(dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) framework from the global fit @xcite and extend it to lower values of @xmath10 using the double leading - log approximation @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the running leading - order ( lo ) coupling is defined as @xmath43 this approach correctly incorporates the leading @xmath44 terms . in this calculation (",
    "called mrst on the plots ) we have used the lo formulae for the partonic cross section and multiplied them by the factor @xmath45 which accounts for the next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections .",
    "another approach is to use the bfkl(balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ) @xcite framework which resums the leading terms @xmath46 .",
    "this approach is probably more appropriate since in the process considered , @xmath47 is fixed and not too large whereas the values of bjorken @xmath10 probed are very small . we have chosen to use the gluon distribution function obtained from the solution of unifed bfkl / dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "this approach ( which we call kms on the plots ) has the advantage of treating both the bfkl and dglap evolution schemes on equal footing and it also resums the major part of the nlo corrections to the bfkl equation via the so - called kinematical constraint @xcite . in this framework one is using the high energy factorisation theorem @xcite together with the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath48 which is related to the integrated distribution @xmath49 @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the virtuality of the gluon .",
    "more precisely for the evaluation of the cross section one has to use the off - shell matrix element for @xmath52 convoluted with functions @xmath48",

    "this approach is more appropriate at small @xmath10 since it accounts for the resummation of the @xmath46 terms in the splitting @xmath56 .    in the third calculation ( which we refer as to gbw ) we have included the effects which might come from the parton saturation . in the region of high energies , where the parton densities become high ,",
    "the gluon recombination effects can become important .",
    "these effects lead to the slower increase of the parton density with energy and in consequence to the damping of the cross section . this is called perturbative parton saturation . for a review on various approaches to this phenomenon ,",
    "see @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we have used very successful model by golec - biernat and wuesthoff @xcite which is formulated within the dipole picture of high energy scattering .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to the description of the inclusive and diffractive data on deep inelastic scattering at hera .",

    "the transition scale @xmath80 between the linear and saturated regimes called saturation scale grows with energy like a power ( [ eq : satscale ] ) .",
    "the larger the energy the smaller the dipole which will saturate .",
    "this model has been extended from @xmath81 to describe the @xmath56 process as well and applied to the prompt charm production @xcite .",
    "let us finally note , that gbw model contains much more than the perturbative saturation .",
    "this model is valid for all values of @xmath82 and the dipole cross section extends to arbitrary large dipole sizes , therefore gbw parametrisation necessarily embodies a lot of soft or nonperturbative components .    in fig .",

    "this is because the parton distributions obtained from solution to the unifed dglap / bfkl evolution equations exhibit a stronger growth with energy than the ones from standard calculation within the dglap approach .",
    "the difference between the kms and mrst calculations at lowest energies can be explained by the fact that the latter has been multiplied uniformly by the next - to - leading k factor ( @xmath85 ) , whereas the kms calculation uses the off - shell matrix element which in principle contains subleading corrections , important at high energies . on the other hand , in the low energy regime",
    "the gluon distribution is probed at rather large values of @xmath86 and so the @xmath87 resummation in matrix element in kms calculation is not effective .",
    "the kms prediction should be in principle multiplied by the energy dependent k factor which would vanish in the high energy region .      in order to calculate the final neutrino flux one has to follow the sequence of the charm production , charm quark fragmentation and charm meson decay into neutrinos .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the partonic distribution persists to feel the nonlinearity even for momenta higher than the saturation scale , more precisely in the window @xmath184 .",
    "therefore the saturation effects can become non - negligible even at highest energies and they could be enhanced by the scattering of the neutrino on the nucleus .",
    "we have mentioned at the beginning that the neutrinos interact very weakly and therefore do not get disturbed during their way from the source to the detector on earth . however , for the ultrahigh energy neutrinos the situation changes due to the increasing value of the neutrino - nucleon cross section , see figs .",
    "[ fig : epow],[fig : ccnc ] .",
    "the ultrahigh energy neutrinos will undergo attenuation when penetrating earth @xcite .",
    "it is well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : length ] where the interaction length @xmath185 is shown together with the maximal column depth @xmath186 which is encountered by neutrino traversing along the diameter of the earth .",
    "it is obvious that the interaction length becomes shorter for neutrinos with energies exceeding @xmath187 .",
    "thus earth will start to become opaque to highly energetic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these effects can be studied using transport equations for the neutrino flux @xmath188 where the total cross section is the sum of charged and neutral current components @xmath189 and where @xmath190 is the fractional energy loss @xmath191 .",
    "@xmath192 with @xmath193 being the density of the earth along the neutrino path and @xmath194 is avogadro number .",
    "the total depth length @xmath195 depends on the incident nadir angle which is defined as the angle between the direction of the neutrino arrival and the normal to the earth surface passing through the detector .",
    "the first term in eq.([eq : earthtrans ] ) corresponds to the neutrino attenuation whereas the second term is responsible for the neutrino regeneration through the neutral current interactions at higher energies .",
    "it is useful to study the general properties of the solution by showing the shadowing factor @xmath196 for two different forms of initial flux , fig .",
    "[ fig : sfact ] . first is the steeply falling atmospheric @xcite neutrino flux @xmath197 and second is the active galactic nuclei flux @xcite which is characterised by rather flat behaviour in the interval @xmath198 .     as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath147 for three different incident angles @xmath199 and two different models for the fluxes : atmospheric ( left plots ) and agns ( right plots ) .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the solution of the full transport equation whereas the dashed line corresponds to the shadowing factor being purely absorption @xmath200 without regeneration.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    three different incident angles are considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfact ] which correspond to different values of @xmath201 for @xmath202 correspondingly .",
    "additionally we show the pure attenuation factor @xmath203 which would occur , if the neutral current regeneration given by the second term in eq.([eq : earthtrans ] ) would not be present .",
    "it is apparent that for the large column depths , the attenuation at high energies is very strong , essentially only about @xmath204 of the initial flux survives at energies @xmath205 and the flux gets completely absorbed at yet higher energies .",
    "what is also visible is the fact that the regeneration due to the neutral current interaction is most prominent for flat fluxes like the one from agn , and rather negligible for steeply falling spectra like the atmospheric one . in some range of energies the effect of regeneration",
    "is quite large , in which case the shadowing factor is bigger than @xmath206 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfact ] .     as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath147 for four different incident angles @xmath199 and @xmath207 ( initial flux @xmath208 ) and three different models for the fluxes : atmospheric , td model and the grb model.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] we show the resulting neutrino flux @xmath209 reaching the detector at different nadir angles @xmath210 as a function of energy for grb model @xcite , top - down model @xcite and the atmospheric flux .",
    "the grb and td fluxes dominate over the atmospheric flux at energies above @xmath164 .",
    "however at small nadir angles we see the strong attenuation of all fluxes at higher energies .",
    "the smaller the nadir angle the greater the shadowing .",
    "therefore one has to adopt different method for searching the ultrahigh energy neutrino events in the detectors whenever @xmath211 . for smaller energies it is sufficient to look for the upgoing muon events , which are always neutrino induced .",
    "this reduces the background from the atmospheric muons . for higher energies due to the discussed earth shadowing one",
    "has too look for the horizontal or downgoing highly energetic muon events .",
    "a detailed study on the possibility of detecting tau neutrinos using horizontal arrays has been performed in @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite that the propagation of tau neutrinos through the earth is quite different from the muon and electron neutrinos .",
    "the earth in principle never becomes opaque to the high energy tau neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this is due to the very short lifetime of the @xmath195 lepton , which decays quickly , producing in the final state tau neutrino still with very high energy .",
    "this process continues until the @xmath11 energy is reduced to the value at which the interaction length is equal to the column depth through the earth .",
    "the tau neutrinos will thus never disappear from the high energy spectrum , the flux will be only redistributed towards the lower energies with possible pile - up around the transparency energy .",
    "this is different than in the case of muons , which live substantially longer and loose their energy via interactions .",
    "when they finally decay , they produce a muon neutrino with very low energy .",
    "the effect of tau regeneration is mostly prominent for the flat fluxes , where significant enhancement can been seen around the transparency energy @xcite . on the other hand for the steeply falling fluxes",
    "the regeneration effect is negligible .      in this section",
    "we are going to study how the fluxes of neutrinos at high energies are modified by the oscillation mechanism .",
    "it is now well established experimentally @xcite that neutrinos undergo flavour - changing oscillations @xcite . due to the high energy of extragalactic neutrinos ,",
    "the oscillation length is much larger than the diameter of the earth so the probability that ultrahigh energy neutrinos will oscillate on their way from the surface of the earth to the detector is very small . in fact , the oscillation length in vacuum increases linearly with energy [ eq : lvac ] l_v = .",
    "if one takes the matter effects into account @xcite , then the effective oscillation length in matter and the effective mixing angle become l_m = l_v ^-1/2 , 2_m = , [ eq : msw ] where @xmath212 originates from the matter contribution to the oscillation length and is given by @xmath213 here @xmath214 is the electron density and @xmath215 is the number density in units of avogadro number@xmath216 .",
    "an important property of @xmath217 , is the fact that it saturates at the value @xmath212 given by ( [ eq : lval ] ) .",
    "however , at sufficiently high energy @xmath218 is very large and the effective mixing angle @xmath219 tends to zero .",
    "this means that for large energies @xmath220 one can safely neglect the matter oscillation effects for the neutrinos in their passage through the earth .    on the other hand",
    ", oscillations can change the initial neutrino flux as compared to the primary neutrino flux produced far in the extragalactic source .",
    "this is of course due to very large distances which neutrinos have to cover on their way from the cosmic source to the earth .",
    "it is believed , that the neutrinos emerge as a decay products of the pions which are produced in @xmath221 and @xmath13 collisions . since @xmath222 neutrinos are produced in ratios @xmath223 for @xmath224 .",
    "more precisely the @xmath11 flux is produced @xcite but is smaller than @xmath225 and @xmath88 flux and comes from the decay chain of heavy mesons in the @xmath13 collisions via the similar process as described in sec.2.1 in the case of the prompt lepton production in the atmosphere . due to the very long path to the earth the arriving neutrinos",
    "will be completely mixed @xcite which will result in the equal numbers for all species @xmath226 .",
    "let us recall ( see for example @xcite ) that in the three flavour framework the mass and the flavour eigenstates are related by means of the unitary mixing matrix @xmath227 @xmath228 \\ ; = \\ ; u \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\nu_1\\\\ \\nu_2\\\\ \\nu_3 \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : mns}\\ ] ] the probability of the flavour oscillation from the neutrino @xmath229 to neutrino @xmath230 after travelling length @xmath62 is given by @xmath231 in the limit when @xmath232 one gets @xmath233 the cosmic neutrino flux @xmath234 after travelling very long distance can be expressed as a product of the matrix @xmath235 and the intrinsic flux @xmath236 @xmath237 \\ ; = \\ ; a a^t \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } f^0(\\nu_e)\\\\ f^0(\\nu_{\\mu})\\\\ f^0(\\nu_{\\tau } ) \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is defined by ( [ eq : transp ] ) @xmath238 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : aa}\\ ] ]",
    "since there is an experimental evidence @xcite that @xmath239 , it means that @xmath88 and @xmath11 are maximally mixed so that @xmath240 ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "this symmetry between @xmath88 and @xmath11 results in the complete mixture of the all three neutrino species which would arrive at earth in equal proportion @xcite @xmath226 .",
    "an interesting possibility of the neutrino decay has been considered recently @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two body decays have been considered _",
    "i _ j + x and _",
    "i |_j + x , [ eq : nudecay ] where @xmath89 is some very light massless particle , for example a majoron .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the decays can lead to ratios which are dramatically different than @xmath226 resulting from oscillations .",
    "thus an important experimental challenge is the flavour decomposition of the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "the deviation from the uniform mixture would definitely point towards new physics like unstable neutrinos or cpt violation .",
