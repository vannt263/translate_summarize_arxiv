    "ergodicity is one of the most important properties of large statistical systems .",
    "we usually assume that macroscopic systems in equilibrium are ergodic .",
    "ergodicity , or quasi - ergodicity , means the phase trajectory comes arbitrarily close to any point of the space allowed by macroscopic constraints .",
    "the physically most important form of the ergodic theorem due to birkhoff tells us that time average along the phase - space trajectory equals the statistical average over the whole phase volume.@xcite it means that the equilibrium state must span the whole available phase space .",
    "although the foundations of statistical mechanics are based on ergodicity , lack of ergodicity is widespread in physical phenomena.@xcite typical examples of ergodicity breaking are phase transitions with symmetry breaking .",
    "broken ergodicity is sometimes used as a generalization of symmetry breaking.@xcite although broken global symmetry is always accompanied by broken ergodicity , the converse does not hold .",
    "there are systems that break ergodicity without any apparent symmetry of the hamiltonian being broken .",
    "the typical example is structural glass with numerous metastable states that prevent the macroscopic system from reaching the true equilibrium on experimental time scales .",
    "broken ergodicity represents an obstruction in the application of fundamental thermodynamic laws .",
    "it hence must be recovered .",
    "when ergodicity is broken in a phase transition breaking a symmetry of the hamiltonian , one introduces a symmetry breaking field into the hamiltonian , being the legendre conjugate to the extensive variable that is not conserved in the broken symmetry transformation in the low - temperature phase .",
    "the symmetry - breaking field allows one to circumvent the critical point of the symmetry - breaking phase transition and simultaneously restores ergodicity .",
    "systems with no broken symmetry of the hamiltonian at the phase transition , such as spin glasses or some quantum phase transitions , do not offer external symmetry - breaking fields and other techniques must be employed to find the proper portion of the phase space covered by the phase - space trajectory .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the peculiarities of ergodicity breaking in phase transitions in frustrated disordered systems described by random non - local interaction without any directional preference in the phase space of the fundamental variables .",
    "we use mean - field spin - glass models with a gaussian random spin - exchange and show how one can restore ergodicity via hierarchical replicating the spin variables of the original hamiltonian .",
    "we present a general scheme of the real - replica method and apply it on mean - field ising , potts and @xmath0-spin glass models .",
    "the three generic models show different ways in which ergodicity is broken and we demonstrate on them how the phase space of the equilibrium state can be constructed .",
    "we manifest that ergodicity breaking is equivalent to the replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "birkhoff ergodic theorem allows one to introduce equal  priori probability of allowed states in the phase space .",
    "it is , however , nontrivial to determine in macroscopic parameters which the allowed states indeed are .",
    "this is actually the most difficult task in constructing the proper phase space in statistical models .",
    "that is , to find out which points of the phase space are infinitesimally close to the trajectory of the many - body system extended to infinite times .",
    "since we never solve the equation of motion of the statistical system , we have only static means to check validity of ergodicity .",
    "we then test consequences of the ergodic hypothesis on the behavior of the equilibrium state .",
    "the most important consequence of ergodicity of statistical systems is the existence of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the trajectory of the many - body system covers almost the whole allowed phase space .",
    "it means that the space covered by such trajectory does not depend on the initial state in non - chaotic systems . in ergodic systems",
    "then the thermodynamic limit does not depend on the specific form of the volume in which the macroscopic state is confined as well as on its surrounding environment .",
    "the macroscopic systems can either be isolated or embedded in a thermal bath .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium , the equilibrium state in the thermodynamic limit , is the same with vanishing relative statistical fluctuations .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium can then be reached by limiting any partial volume of the whole to infinity .",
    "the ergodic equilibrium state is homogeneous in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thermodynamic homogeneity is usually expressed via euler s lemma@xcite @xmath1 telling us that entropy @xmath2 is an extensive variable and is a first - order homogeneous function of all extensive variables , internal energy @xmath3 , volume @xmath4 number of particles @xmath5 , and model dependent other extensive variables @xmath6 . as a consequence of euler s lemma",
    "we obtain that thermodynamic equilibrium is attained as a one - parameter scaling limit where we have only one independent large scale , extensive variable , be either volume or number of particles , and the other extensive variables enter thermodynamic potentials as volume or particle densities insensitive to changes of the scaling variable .",
    "thermodynamic homogeneity allows us to use scaling of the original phase space .",
    "thermodynamic quantities remain unchanged if we arbitrarily rescale the phase space and then divide the resulting thermodynamic potential by the chosen scaling ( geometric ) factor .",
    "we can do that by scaling energy @xmath7 of the equilibrium state .",

    "the reason to introduce replicas of the original variables is to extend the space of available states in the search for the allowed space in equilibrium .",
    "the replicas are independent when introduced .",
    "we use the replicated variables to study stability of the original system with respect to fluctuations in the thermal bath . to this purpose",
    "we break independence of the replica variables by switching on a ( homogeneous ) infinitesimal interaction between the replicas that we denote @xmath14 .",
    "we then add a small interacting part @xmath15 to the replicated hamiltonian with dynamical variables @xmath6 .",
    "the original system is then stable with respect to fluctuations in the bath , represented by the interaction with the replicated variables , if the linear response to perturbation @xmath16 is not broken . if the linear response holds then the perturbed free energy per replica relaxes , after switching perturbation @xmath16 off , to the original one in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17 { } \\ln\\mathrm{tr}\\exp\\left\\{-\\beta h\\right\\ } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 refers to trace in the @xmath8-times replicated phase space .",

    "they induce new order parameters in the response of the system to these fields that need not vanish in the low - temperature phase , when the linear response breaks down .",
    "they offer a way to disclose a degeneracy when the thermodynamic limit is not uniquely defined by a single extensive scale and densities of the other extensive variables .",
