    "torus doubling bifurcation ( geometrically similar to period doubling bifurcation ) as a universal route to chaos is turning out to be one of the leading topics of research in the study of quasiperiodically forced chaotic dynamical systems during the past few years @xcite .",
    "the existence of such an exotic bifurcation in several experimental situations and theoretical models indicates the importance of this bifurcation in improving our understanding of the qualitative and quantitative behaviours of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "a very common observation is that such systems do not undergo an infinite sequence of doubling bifurcations as in the case of the lower dimensional systems ; instead , the truncation of torus doubling begins when the doubled torus becomes extremely wrinkled and then gets destroyed .",
    "such a destroyed torus is a geometrically strange ( fractal dimensional ) object in the phase space , a property that usually corresponds to that of a chaotic attractor .",
    "however , it would not exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions asymptotically ( for example , lyapunov exponents are nonpositive ) and hence is not chaotic and so it is a strange nonchaotic attractor(sna ) @xcite .",
    "actually the existence of sna was first identified by grebogi _",
    "@xcite in their work on the transition from two - frequency torus to chaos via sna .",
    "later on , it was found that these attractors can arise in physically relevant situations such as a quasiperiodically forced pendulum @xcite , quantum particles in quasiperiodic potentials @xcite , biological oscillators @xcite , duffing - type oscillators @xcite , velocity - dependent potential systems @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , and in certain maps @xcite in different transitions to sna including the torus doubling bifurcation and the birth of snas .",
    "also , the existence of torus doubling truncation and the appearance of sna was confirmed by an experiment consisting of a quasiperiodically forced , buckled magnetoelastic ribbon @xcite . besides this experiment ,",
    "the exotic strange nonchaotic attractors were studied in analog simulations of a multistable potential @xcite , and in neon glow discharge experiment @xcite through different transitions to snas .",
    "the existence of snas in such physically relevant systems has naturally motivated further intense investigations on the nature and occurrence of them .",
    "a question of intense further interest in the topic is the way in which the truncation of period doubling occurs to give birth to snas .",
    "in particular , it has been found that the birth of snas often occurs due to the collision of a period doubled torus with its unstable parent so that a period 2@xmath1torus gives rise to a 2@xmath2band sna @xcite or a gradual fractalization of torus , in which a period 2@xmath1torus approaches a 2@xmath1band sna @xcite .",
    "recently , the present authors have identified that the torus doubling sequence is tamed due to a subharmonic bifurcation ( subcritical period - doubling bifurcation ) leading to the creation of snas .",
    "in addition , this transition has been shown to exhibit type - iii intermittent characteristic scaling @xcite . apart from the creation of snas due to the collapse of the tori",
    ", the authors have also shown that there are some regions of the system parameters where the torus doubling sequence is truncated by a merging bifurcation leading to the formation of a torus bubble @xcite , reminiscent of period bubbles in low dimensional systems .",
    "also , using the renormalization group approach , kuznetsov , feudal and pikovsky have revealed scaling properties both for the critical attractor and for the parameter plane topography near the terminal point of the torus doubling bifurcation @xcite in connection with the above mentioned collision scenario .    besides the creation of snas through the above mentioned truncation of torus doubling bifurcation , several other mechanisms have also been studied in the literature for the birth of snas . the most common one is gradual fractalization of a torus where an amplitude or phase instability causes the collapse of the torus @xcite .",
    "this is in fact one of the least understood mechanisms for the formation of snas since there is no apparent bifurcation unlike the torus collision mechanism identified by feudel , kurths and pikovsky where a stable torus and an unstable torus collide at a dense set of points , leading to the creation of snas @xcite .",
    "prasad , mehra and ramaswamy @xcite have shown that a quasiperiodic analogue of a saddle - node bifurcation gives rise to snas through the intermittent route with the dynamics exhibiting scaling behaviour characteristic of type ",
    "i intermittency .",
    "yalcinkaya and lai have described that an on - off intermittency can be associated with sna creation through a blow - out bifurcation when a torus loses its transverse stability @xcite .",
    "other than the above said scenarios , a number of other quasiperiodic routes to snas have been described in the literature @xcite .",
    "they include the existence of snas in the transition from two - frequency to three - frequency quasiperiodicity @xcite , transition from three - frequency to chaos via sna and transition to chaos via strange nonchaotic trajectories on torus @xcite .",
    "considering particularly the different routes discussed above for the inhibition of torus doubling sequence and the birth of snas , we note that they have so far been identified essentially in @xmath3 dynamical systems .",
    "however , it is important to study the truncation of the torus doubling bifurcations and the appearance of snas in a single system in order to understand the mechanisms and their characteristic features clearly . in this connection",
    ", we consider a simple model in the form of an one - dimensional cubic map , @xmath4 which is quite analogous to the typical duffing oscillator @xcite .",
    "the existence of different dynamical features of this system has been studied in refs.@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the dynamics of ( 1 ) with the addition of a constant bias , @xmath5 and also subject to an additional quasiperiodic forcing , @xmath6 @xmath7 and show that the latter is a rich dynamical system in comparison with the former , possessing a vast number of regular , strange nonchaotic and chaotic attractors in a two - parameter @xmath0 space for a fixed @xmath8 . in particular , we focus our attention mainly on the truncation of torus - doubling bifurcations leading to the birth of snas and the mechanisms by which they arise in a range of the two - parameter @xmath0 space , besides pointing out the standard transitions to chaos via snas from one frequency torus .",
    "a variety of transitions from truncated doubled torus to snas could be identified , characterized and distinguished in this system .    to start with ,",
    "we show that the system ( 2 ) undergoes one or more period doublings but it need not complete the entire feigenbaum cascade , and that it may be possible to have only a finite number of period doublings , followed by , for example , undoubling or other bifurcations in the presence of constant bias , as was shown by bier and bountis in different systems @xcite .",
    "the possibility of such a different remerging bifurcation phenomenon in the torus doubling sequence is reported in the present case , when the system ( 2 ) is subjected to quasiperiodic forcing as in model ( 3 ) . as the system ( 3 ) possesses more than one control parameter and remains invariant under reflection symmetry ,",
    "the remergence is likely to occur as in the absence of quasiperiodic forcing in the system ( 2 ) .",
    "our numerical study shows that for fixed value of @xmath8 in some regions of the @xmath0 parameter space a torus doubled orbit emerges and remerges from a single torus orbit at two different parameter values of @xmath9 to form a single torus bubble .",
    "such a remerging bifurcation can retard the growth of the torus doubled bifurcations and the development of the associated universal route to chaos further .",
    "however , the nature of remerging torus doubled bifurcation or , more specifically , the torus bubbling ensures the existence of different routes for the creation of snas when the full range of parameters is explored . to illustrate such possibilities in the present system in the two - parameter @xmath0 space ,",
    "we first enumerate three standard types of routes to sna namely , ( 1 ) heagy - hammel ( @xmath10 collision of period doubled torus with its unstable parent ) , ( 2 ) gradual fractalization ( @xmath10the amplitude or phase instability ) , and ( 3 ) type  iii intermittency ( @xmath10the subharmonic instability ) routes through which the truncation of torus doubling bifurcation occurs leading to the birth of snas within the torus bubble region .",
    "in addition , we identify that in some cross sections of the @xmath0 parameter space , particularly within the torus bubble region , the period doubling bifurcation phenomenon still persists in the destroyed torus , eventhough the actual doubling of the torus itself has been terminated .",
    "however , we show that * the novel dynamics involved in this transition is a sudden expansion in the attractor*. this transition seems to look like the interior crisis which occurs in low dimensional chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrate the occurrence of snas through gradual fractalization and type ",
    "i intermittent nature , during the transition from one - frequency quasiperiodicity to chaos that exists outside the torus bubble region .    in all our studies the transitions to different snas at different parts of the border in the @xmath0 parameter plane and characterization of them",
    "is carried out on the basis of specific quantities such as lyapunov exponents and their variance as well as finite - time lyapunov exponents , dimensions , power spectral measures and phase sensitivity exponents .",
    "brief details of these characterizing quantities are given in the appendix a. in sec .",
    "ii we describe the phenomenon of the remerging of feigenbaum tree in the absence of quasiperiodic forcing in the map ( 2 ) .",
    "the existence of remerging torus doubling is pointed out in sec .",
    "various transitions to snas through the truncated doubled torus are demonstrated in sec .",
    "iv . in particular ,",
    "the truncation of torus doubling bifurcation and the birth of snas through torus collision , fractalization and type  iii intermittent mechanisms have been explained .",
    "further , a sudden expansion of the attractor causing the truncation of torus doubling bifurcation and the genesis of sna is also demonstrated . in sec .",
    "v , the transition from one - frequency torus to sna through type ",
    "i intermittent as well as fractalization mechanisms is described . in sec .",
    "vi the transitions between different snas are discuused . in sec .",
    "vii we address the issue of distinguishing among snas formed by different routes through the use of finite - time lyapunov exponents . finally , in sec .",
    "viii , the results are summarized .",
    "to start with , we consider the system ( 2 ) and numerically iterate it by varying the values of @xmath11 and @xmath8 . for any @xmath8 value and low @xmath11 values , the system ( 2 ) exhibits periodic oscillations with period 1 t .",
    "as @xmath11 increases , a bifurcation occurs and the stable period t orbit transits into a stable period 2 t bubble , as shown in fig .",
    "for example , when the value of @xmath8 exceeds a certain critical value @xmath8=@xmath100.99 for a fixed @xmath11 , @xmath11=1.5 , a transition from period t orbit to period 2 t orbit occurs on increasing @xmath8 , essentially due to period doubling bifurcation . then the period 2 t attractor merges and forms a period t attractor when the value of @xmath8 increases to @xmath8=0.99 at the same fixed @xmath11 . at even higher values of @xmath11 , @xmath11=1.7 ,",
    "the primary period 2 t bubble bifurcates into secondary period 4 t bubbles , as shown in fig .",
    "this bubble develops into further bubbles as @xmath11 gets larger , until an infinitely branched feigenbaum tree leading to the onset of chaos finally appears , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) for @xmath11=1.8 .",
    "bier and bountis showed that such a remerging of feigenbaum trees is quite common in certain models possessing a kind of reflection symmetry property coupled with more than one parameter @xcite .",
    "further , they added that the formation of primary period 2 t bubble is seen to lead to higher order bubbles and the development of the associated universal route to chaos in these systems .",
    "it is also stated in the literature that the reversal of period doubling occurs when the system possesses a positive schwarzian derivative at the bifurcation point @xcite .",
    "this is true for the present case that we study .",
    "however , there are some counter examples as pointed out by nusse and yorke @xcite to show that the positivity of schwarzian derivative is not a sufficient condition to rule out the period halving bifurcations .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to investigate the effect of a quasiperiodic forcing on the system ( 2 ) as given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "in particular , we point out that with the addition of the quasiperiodic forcing for a fixed @xmath8 , the dynamics is dominated by quasiperiodic attractors and transitions to chaos via strange nonchaotic attractors ( snas ) along different routes in contrast to the type of attractors shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for this purpose we also work out a two parameter @xmath0 phase diagram ( fig .  2 ) to identify the changes in the dynamics .",
    "now we consider the dynamics of the quasiperiodically driven map ( 3 ) and numerically iterate it with the value of the parameter @xmath12 fixed at @xmath13 and by varying the values of @xmath11 and @xmath9 for different fixed values of @xmath8 .",
    "the results are then summarized in a suitable two - parameter @xmath0 phase diagram for each fixed value of @xmath8 .",
    "various dynamical behaviours @xmath10 quasiperiodic , strange nonchaotic , and chaotic attractors @xmath10 have been identified by characterizing the attractors by quantities such as lyapunov exponents and their variance as well as finite - time lyapunov exponents , dimensions , power spectral measures and phase sensitivity exponents ( for details , see in appendix a ) .    in the absence of the external forcing @xmath14 , from fig .  1 , we can easily check that for fixed @xmath8 and for given @xmath11 the dynamics corresponds to periodic or chaotic attractors .",
    "for instance , for @xmath15 and for any values of @xmath11 , the system admits a period-2 solution .",
    "similarly , for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it is a period-4 orbit , while for @xmath18 and @xmath17 , it is a chaotic orbit .",
    "we now include the effect of quasiperiodic forcing @xmath19 and analyse the dynamics involving torus , period doubled torus and chaos via snas .",
    "a very clear picture of the various types of transitions becomes available for the case @xmath15 in the region @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while similar structure arises in a larger region for other values of @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , we present in the following results for @xmath15 only in the form of the phase diagram in fig .  2 .",
    "the various features indicated in fig .",
    "2 are summarised and the dynamical transitions are discussed in the following .",
    "the general features of the phase diagram fall into a very interesting pattern .",
    "it can be observed from fig .  2 that the dynamics is symmetric about @xmath220 .",
    "therefore , in the following we present the details for the right half of @xmath23 line only .",
    "the features are exactly similar in the left half of the @xmath23 line .",
    "there are two chaotic regions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . bordering these chaotic regions , one has the regions where the attractors are strange and nonchaotic .",
    "such snas are found to appear in a large number of regions under various mechanisms , some of which are marked gf1 , gf2 , gf3 & gf4 , hh , ic , s1 & s3 . besides the strange nonchaotic and chaotic attractors in the phase diagram fig .  2",
    ", one can also observe different regions where quasiperiodic attractors can be found . in fig .  2 ,",
    "such regions are marked as 1 t and 2 t , corresponding to the quasiperiodic attractors of period-1 and period-2 respectively .",
    "fuller details are given below .",
    "for low @xmath11 and any @xmath9 value , the system exhibits quasiperiodic oscillations denoted by 1 t in fig .  2 .",
    "on increasing the value of @xmath11 further , the fascinating phenomenon of torus bubble appears within a range of values of @xmath9 . to be more specific , the parameter @xmath11 is for example fixed at @xmath11=1.1 and then @xmath9 is varied .",
    "for @xmath9=@xmath100.3 , the attractor is a quasiperiodic one ( 1 t ) . as @xmath9",
    "is increased to @xmath9=@xmath100.18 , the attractor undergoes torus - doubling bifurcation and the corresponding orbit is denoted as 2 t in fig .",
    "2 . as @xmath9",
    "is increased further , one then expects that the doubled attractor continues the doubling sequence as in the case of the generic period - doubling phenomenon .",
    "instead , in the present case , the doubled attractor begins to merge into that of a single attractor at @xmath9= 0.18 , leading to the formation of a torus bubble reminiscent of period bubbles in low dimensional systems as in the previous section .",
    "on refixing the parameter @xmath11 at higher values , one finds that there are two prominent regions of chaotic oscillations c1 and c2 as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the chaotic region c1 exists outside the torus bubble region .",
    "that is , it essentially occurs for larger a values , @xmath261.2 and @xmath270.6 . on the other hand , the region c2 emerges within the torus bubble region .",
    "that is , it appears predominantly for even larger values of @xmath11 , @xmath261.549 and @xmath9 lying between , @xmath100.8@xmath280.8 .",
    "we have identified two interesting dynamical transitions from one frequency quasiperiodicity to chaos via snas outside the torus bubble region .",
    "they are ( 1 ) gradual fractalization of the torus leading to creation of sna ( gf4 ) , and ( 2 ) type ",
    "i intermittent route leading to the birth of sna ( s1 ) .",
    "on the other hand there exist atleast four types of transitions to chaos via snas within the torus bubble where the doubling of torus is interrupted , namely ( 1 ) heagy - hammel ( hh ) , ( 2 ) fractalization ( gf1 , gf2 & gf3 ) , ( 3 ) type  iii intermittent ( s3 ) and ( 4 ) doubling of destroyed tori routes through which the torus doubling bifurcation is truncated and the birth of strange nonchaotic attractor takes place .",
    "the details for each of the regions are given in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we will describe each one of the four types of transition to chaos via snas within the torus bubble region in detail .",
    "the first of the routes which we encounter is the heagy - hammel route in which a period@xmath10 2@xmath29 torus gets wrinkled and upon collision with its unstable parent period@xmath10 2@xmath30 torus bifurcates into an sna @xcite .",
    "such a route has been identified in the region c2 within the range of @xmath11 values , 1.549@xmath312.183 , and @xmath9 values , 0.39@xmath280.8 .",
    "that is the doubling bifurcation is truncated due to the collision of the doubled torus with its unstable parent on increasing the value of a , in the range 1.549@xmath312.183 , for a fixed @xmath9 value ( 0.39@xmath280.8 ) .",
    "it is denoted as hh in fig .  2 .",
    "for example , let us fix the parameter @xmath9 at @xmath9=0.7 and vary @xmath11 . for @xmath11=1.8 ,",
    "the attractor is a quasiperiodic one , as denoted by 1 t in fig .",
    "2 . as @xmath11",
    "is increased to @xmath11=1.876 , the attractor undergoes torus doubling bifurcation and the corresponding periodic orbit is denoted as 2 t in fig .  2 .",
    "in the generic case , the period doubling occurs in an infinite sequence until the accumulation point is reached , beyond which chaotic behaviour appears .",
    "however , with tori , in the present case , the truncation of the torus doubling begins when the two strands of the 2 t attractor become extremely wrinkled .",
    "for example , when the value of @xmath11 is increased to @xmath11=1.8868 , the attractor becomes wrinkled as shown in fig .",
    "at this transition , the strands are seen to come closer to the unstable period 1 t orbit and lose their continuities when the strands of torus doubled orbit collide with unstable parent and ultimately result in a fractal attractor as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) when @xmath11 is increased to @xmath11=1.88697 .",
    "at such a value , the attractor , fig .",
    "3(b ) , possesses a geometrically strange property but does not exhibit any sensitivity to initial conditions ( the maximal lyapunov exponent is negative as seen in fig .",
    "4(a ) ) and so it is indeed a strange nonchaotic attractor .",
    "at this transition , the two branches of the wrinkled attractor collide and form a one band sna .",
    "this kind of transition is similar to the attractor merging crisis occuring in chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "as @xmath11 is increased further to @xmath11=1.8878 , the attractor has eventually a positive lyapunov exponent and hence it corresponds to a chaotic attractor ( c2 ) .",
    "now we examine the lyapunov exponent for the transition from torus to sna .",
    "4(a ) is a plot of the maximal lyapunov exponent as a function of @xmath11 for @xmath9=0.7 . when we examine this in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the critical value @xmath32=1.88697 , the transition is clearly revealed by the lyapunov exponent which varies smoothly in the torus region ( @xmath33 ) while it varies irregularly in the sna region ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is also possible to identify this transition point by examining the variance of the lyapunov exponent , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) in which the fluctuation is small in the torus region while it is large in the sna region .",
    "in addition , in order to distinguish the quasiperiodic attractor and the strange nonchaotic attractor , we may examine the attractor with reference to the phase @xmath35 of the external force .",
    "the details of this analysis are given in appendix a. from eq.(a.4 ) , one infers that the function @xmath36 grows infinitely for a sna with some relation such as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a positive quantity which characterises the sna and we may call it the phase sensitivity exponent . for the present case ,",
    "it is @xmath38=0.98 .",
    "however , in the case of a chaotic attractor , it grows exponentially with n ( see fig .",
    "4(c ) ) .",
    "the second of the routes is the gradual fractalization route where a torus gets increasingly wrinkled and then transits to a sna without interaction ( as against the previous case ) with a nearby unstable orbit as we change the system parameter . in this route ,",
    "a period@xmath102@xmath29 torus becomes wrinkled and then the wrinkled attractor gradually loses its smoothness and forms a 2@xmath39band sna as we change the system parameter .",
    "such a phenomenon has been identified in the present system in three different regions indicated as gf1 , gf2 and gf3 in fig .",
    "2 . to exemplify this nature of transition",
    ", we fix the parameter @xmath9 at @xmath9=0.1 and vary @xmath11 in the gf3 region . for @xmath11=1.0 ,",
    "the system exhibits quasiperiodic oscillation of period-1 t .",
    "the attractor undergoes a torus doubling bifurcation as @xmath11 is increased to @xmath11=1.06 . increasing the @xmath11 value further , a second period doubling of the doubled torus does not take place .",
    "instead , oscillations of the doubled torus in the amplitude direction starts to appear at @xmath11=2.165 as shown in fig .",
    "as @xmath11 is increased further to @xmath11=2.167 , the oscillatory behaviour of the torus approaches a fractal nature gradually . at such values ,",
    "the nature of the attractor is strange [ see fig .",
    "5(b ) ] eventhough the largest lyapunov exponent in fig .",
    "6(a ) remains negative .",
    "such a phenomenon is essentially a gradual fractalization of the doubled torus as was shown by nishikawa and kaneko in their route to chaos via sna @xcite . in this route",
    ", there is no collision involved among the orbits and therefore the lyapunov exponent increases only slowly as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) and there are no significant changes in its variance [ see fig .",
    "further , the phase sensitivity function @xmath36 grows unboundedly with the power - law relation @xmath40 , @xmath38=0.83 in the sna region , while they are bounded in the torus region [ see fig .",
    "6(c ) ] . at even higher values of @xmath11 , @xmath11=2.17 ,",
    "the system exhibits chaotic oscillations ( c2 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 grows exponentially with n for the chaotic attractors .",
    "the third one of the routes that is predominant in this system within the torus doubled region is an intermittent route in which the torus doubling bifurcation is tamed due to subharmonic bifurcations leading to the creation of sna .",
    "such a phenomenon has been identified within the range of @xmath9 values 0.33@xmath280.41 and on increasing the value @xmath11 , 1.81@xmath312.18 , for a fixed @xmath9 . to illustrate this transition ,",
    "let us fix the parameter @xmath9 at @xmath9=0.35 and vary @xmath11 . for @xmath11=1.0 ,",
    "the attractor is quasiperiodic attractor . as @xmath11",
    "is increased to @xmath11=1.28 , the attractor undergoes torus doubling bifurcation . on increasing the value of @xmath11 further , @xmath11=2.13 ,",
    "the attractor starts to wrinkle . on further increase of @xmath11 value to @xmath11=2.135 ,",
    "the attractor becomes extremely wrinkled and has several sharp bends , as shown in fig .",
    "it has been observed in lower dimensional chaotic systems @xcite that when the system undergoes subcritical period doubling bifurcation , the dynamical behaviour exhibits type iii intermittent motion . in a similar manner",
    ", one finds that the wrinkled attractor undergoes a quasiperiodic analogue of subcritical period doubling bifurcation , on increasing the value of @xmath11 further to @xmath11=2.14 .",
    "the corresponding intermittent motion is shown in fig .",
    "the emergence of such intermittent dynamical behaviour has been found in different continuous systems by the present authors and their collaborators through the intermittent route to chaos via sna @xcite in which it was shown that during the transition from torus doubled attractor to sna , a growth of subharmonic amplitude begins together with a decrease in the size of the fundamental amplitude . at the critical parameter value",
    ", the intermittent attractor loses its smoothness and becomes strange .",
    "the attractor shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) is nothing but a strange nonchaotic one as the lyapunov exponent turns out to be negative [ fig .",
    "when examining the lyapunov exponent at this transition , it has been observed in fig .",
    "8(a ) that the lyapunov exponent shows an abrupt change with a power - law dependence on the parameter on the sna side of the transition and the variance shows a remarkable and abrupt increase at the transition point as shown in fig .",
    "further , the phase sensitivity function @xmath36 is bounded for the torus region while it is unboundedly changing with a power - law variation with @xmath41 for sna region [ fig .  8(c ) ] with @xmath42 . on increasing the value of @xmath11 further to @xmath11=2.153 , we find the emergence of chaotic attractor ( c2 ) where the quantity @xmath36 grows exponentially with n",
    "[ fig .  8(c ) ] .    in the hh case ,",
    "the points on the sna are distributed over the entire region enclosed by the wrinkled bounding torus , while in the gf case the points on the sna are distributed mainly on the boundary of the torus .",
    "interestingly in the present case shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , most of the points of the sna remain within the wrinkled torus with sporadic large deviations .",
    "the dynamics at this transition obviously involves a kind of intermittency .",
    "such an intermittency transition could be characterised by the scaling behaviour .",
    "the laminar phase in this case is the torus while the burst phase is the nonchaotic attractor . in order to calculate the associated scaling constant ,",
    "we coevolve the trajectories for two different values of @xmath11 , namely @xmath43 and another nearby value of @xmath43 , while keeping identical initial conditions ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) as well as the same parameter value @xmath9 .",
    "as the angular coordinate @xmath45 remains identical , the difference in x@xmath46 allows one to compute the average laminar length between the bursts and it fits with the scaling form @xmath47 the numerical value obtained for the attractor shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) is @xmath48 1.1 [ see fig .",
    "to confirm further that the sna attractor [ fig .",
    "7(b ) ] is associated with intermittent dynamics , we plot the frequency of laminar periods of duration @xmath49 , namely n(@xmath49 ) in fig .",
    "it obeys the scaling @xcite law , @xmath50   } \\right \\ }   ^{0.5}. \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] we find that @xmath51=0.007@xmath520.0002 to give a best fit for the present data .",
    "these characteristic studies suggest that the intermittency is of type iii as discussed by pomeau and manneville in low dimensional systems @xcite .      in the previous subsections , we have seen that the period doubling bifurcation of a torus has been truncated by the destruction of it leading to the emergence of an sna in certain regions of the @xmath0 parameter space .",
    "further , we observe that in the present system in some cross sections of the @xmath0 parameter space the period doubling phenomenon still persists in the destroyed torus eventhough the actual doubling phenomenon has been truncated .",
    "but in the present case , it is observed that the doubling of destroyed torus involves a kind of sudden widening of the attractor similar to the crisis phenomenon that occurs in chaotic systems .",
    "such a phenomenon has been observed in the present model in a range of @xmath9 values , 0.13@xmath280.24 , and for a narrow range of @xmath11 values , 2.12@xmath312.14 .",
    "it is denoted as ic in fig .  2 .",
    "for example , let us choose @xmath9=0.2 and vary the value of @xmath11 . for @xmath11=0.8 ,",
    "the attractor is a quasiperiodic one .",
    "as @xmath11 is increased to @xmath11=1.18 , the system undergoes torus doubling bifurcation .",
    "on increasing the value of @xmath11 further to @xmath11=2.138 , the attractor begins to wrinkle as shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) . on increasing the value of @xmath11 further , say , to @xmath11=2.1387 the wrinkled attractor undergoes torus doubling bifurcation and the corresponding orbit is shown in fig .",
    "it is also seen from figs .",
    "10(b ) & ( c ) that when a is slightly larger than @xmath53 the orbit on the attractor spends long stretches of time in the region to which the attractor was confined before the crisis . at the end of these long stretches the orbit bursts out of the old region and bounces around in the new region made available to it by the crisis .",
    "it then returns to the old region for another stretch of time , followed by a burst and so on .",
    "this kind of widening of attractor usually occurs in the chaotic systems at a crisis @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , we have shown such a possibility in a quasiperiodically forced system which also tames the growth of torus doubled cascade , giving birth to snas .",
    "the variation of the lyapunov exponent at such transition does not follow a uniform pattern in contrast to the case of low - dimensional chaotic systems exhibiting crisis phenomenon [ see figs .",
    "11 ( a ) & ( b ) ] .",
    "in addition , the phase sensitivity function @xmath36 grows with @xmath41 with a kind power - law relations for sna while it is bounded for the torus regions [ see fig .",
    "11 ( c ) ] .",
    "on further increase of the value of @xmath11 to @xmath11=2.143 , the system exhibits chaotic oscillations ( c2 ) and the quantity @xmath36 grows exponentially with @xmath41 .",
    "two additional interesting transitions take place outside the torus bubble region , namely ( 1 ) gradual fractalization of the torus leading to the creation of sna , and ( 2 ) type ",
    "i intermittent route leading to the birth of sna .",
    "the details are as follows .",
    "the first one is the gradual fractalization route which is the same as studied in the previous subsection iv b , but the only difference now is that here a transition from a one - frequency torus ( 1 t ) to chaos via sna is realized through gradual fractalization process instead of the transition from the 2 t torus discussed above .",
    "such a phenomenon is identified in the lower side of the c1 region ( gf4 ) .",
    "specifically , within the region of @xmath9,0.58@xmath280.8 , on increasing the value of @xmath11 to the region 1.211@xmath311.569 for a fixed @xmath9 the sna is created through gradual fractalization route . at first , a transition from one - frequency torus to a wrinkled attractor takes place on increasing @xmath11 , @xmath11=1.25 for @xmath9=0.7 as shown in fig.12(a ) .",
    "the wrinkled attractor loses its continuity considerably as @xmath11 is increased further and then finally ends up with fractal phenomenon at @xmath11=1.265 ( see fig .",
    "it is very obvious from these transitions that the torus gradually loses its smoothness and ultimately approaches the fractal behaviour via sna before the onset of chaos as the parameter @xmath11 increases to @xmath11=1.3 .",
    "in addition , it is observed that there is no apparent interaction among the orbits .",
    "the property has been confirmed through the calculation of maximal lyapunov exponent , its variance and phase sensitivity studies as in the period - doubled regions .      a different type of intermittent route , namely type ",
    "i @xcite , via sna is also observed at the upper region of c1 . within the range of values @xmath9,0.58@xmath280.8 , on increasing the value of @xmath11 in the range 1.5 @xmath312.0 , a transition from the chaotic attractor ( c1 ) to sna takes place at first and then the sna is eventually replaced by a one - frequency quasiperiodic orbit through a quasiperiodic analogue of saddle - node bifurcation . at this transition ,",
    "the dynamics is found to be again intermittent but of different type .    to understand more about this phenomenon ,",
    "let us consider the specific parameter value @xmath9= 0.7 and vary @xmath11 . for @xmath11=1.80165 ,",
    "the attractor is a chaotic one ( c1 ) . as @xmath11",
    "is increased to @xmath11=1.801685 , the chaotic attractor transits to sna as shown in fig .",
    "13(a ) . on increasing the value of @xmath11 further , an intermittent transition from the sna to a torus as shown in fig .",
    "13(b ) occurs at @xmath11=1.8017 . at this transition ,",
    "abrupt changes in the lyapunov exponent as well as its variance shows the characteristic signature of intermittent route ( indicated in fig .",
    "14 ( a ) @xmath54 ( b ) ) to sna as in the type iii case .",
    "in addition , again the quantity @xmath36 grows with @xmath41 with a power law relation for sna while it is bounded for the torus regions ( see fig .",
    "however , in the chaotic region , the quantity @xmath36 grows exponentially with n.    further , the plots of laminar length @xmath55 as a function of the derived bifurcation parameter @xmath56 , where a@xmath57 is a critical parameter for the occurrence of intermittent transition , for this attractor reveals a power - law relationship of the form @xmath58 with an estimated value of @xmath59 0.53 ( fig .",
    "also , the plot between the number of laminar periods n(@xmath49 ) and the period length @xmath49 [ shown in fig .  15(b ) ] indicates that after an initial steep decay there is an increase to a large value of n(@xmath49 ) .",
    "it also obeys the relation @xmath60 - \\arctan \\left ( { c \\over \\sqrt { \\epsilon \\over u } } \\right ) \\tau - \\tau^2 \\sqrt{\\epsilon \\over u } \\right \\ } , \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the maximum value of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "the above analysis confirms that such an attractor is associated with the standard intermittent dynamics of type i described in ref .",
    "in the previous sections , we have enumerated the several ways through which snas are created from torus attractors .",
    "one might observe from the @xmath0 phase diagram , fig .  2 , that there are several regions where transitions from one type of sna to another type occurs along the borders separating quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors .",
    "particularly , transitions occur between gf3 and ic , ic and gf2 , gf2 and s3 , s3 and gf1 , gf1 and hh , and , s1 and gf4 . on closer scrutiny , we find that there exists a very narrow range of parameters between different regions of snas where chaotic motion occurs .",
    "that is the sna of one region transits to chaos before exhibiting a different nature of sna in the next region .",
    "however , we refrain from giving finer details as they do not seem to be of significance .",
    "recently , it has been noted by prasad , mehra and ramaswamy @xcite that a typical trajectory on a sna  actually possesses positive lyapunov exponents in finite time intervals , although the asymptotic exponent is negative . as a consequence ,",
    "one observes the different characteristics of the snas born through different mechanisms through a study of the differences in the distribution of finite - time exponents p(n,@xmath65 ) @xcite . for each of the cases ,",
    "the distribution can be obtained by taking a long trajectory and dividing into segments of length n , from which the local lyapunov exponent can be calculated . in the limit of large n , this distribution will collapse to a @xmath66 function @xmath67 .",
    "the deviations from@xmath10 and the approach to @xmath10 the limit can be very different for snas created through different mechanisms .",
    "16 illustrate the distributions for @xmath68 across the five different transitions discussed in the present study .",
    "a common feature of these cases is that @xmath69 is strongly peaked about the lyapunov exponent when the attractor is a torus , but on the sna , the distribution picks up a tail which extends into the local lyapunov exponent @xmath700 region .",
    "this tail is directly correlated with enhanced fluctuation in the lyapunov exponent on snas . on the fractalised sna and doubling of sna , the distribution shifts continuously to larger lyapunov exponents , but the shape remains the same for torus regions as well as sna regions while on the hh and intermittent sna , the actual shapes of the distribution on the torus and the sna are very different .",
    "one remarkable feature of intermittent snas is that the positive tail in the distribution decays very slowly .    to quantify further on the distribution of finite - time lyapunov exponents ,",
    "let us consider , for example , the fraction of exponents lying above @xmath71=0 , @xmath72 vs @xmath41 for the different snas .",
    "it has been found that except for the intermittent sna ( both for type iii and i ) , for which @xmath73 , this quantity decays exponentially , @xmath74 for all other transitions , with the exponents @xmath75 and @xmath76 dependent strongly on the parameters of the system .",
    "for the specific snas corresponding to the parameters reported in the previous section these quantities take the following values : for type iii and type i , the @xmath75 values are 0.38 and 0.71 .",
    "however , for hh , gf and ic , the @xmath75 and @xmath77 values are 0.27 & 0.32 , 0.31 & 017 and 0.24 & 0.34 , respectively .",
    "in this paper we have described the creation of snas through various routes and mechanisms in a protypical example , namely the quasiperiodically driven cubic map .",
    "these are summarised in table i. torus doubling bifurcations are not mandatory for the creation of snas .",
    "however , they are merely a convenient agent in setting the stage for the appearance of snas",
    ". there are atleast four different mechanisms , namely heagy - hammel , gradual fractilazation , type  iii and and crisis - induced intermittency through which the truncation of torus doubling and the birth of snas occur .",
    "the truncation of torus doubling and the genesis of sna through crisis - induced intermittency is a new one and also it is entirely different from the interior crisis mechanism for appearence of snas as found by witt _",
    "@xcite we have further observed atleast two different ways , namely type ",
    "i intermittency and gradual fractalization , through which snas are formed when a transition from one - frequency torus to chaos takes place .",
    "all these phenomena have been identified in a two parameter @xmath0 phase diagram . to distinguish among the different mechanisms through which snas are born , we have examined the manner in which the maximal lyapunov exponent and its variance change as a function of the parameters . in addition ,",
    "we have also examined the distribution of local lyapunov exponents and found that on different snas they have different characteristics .",
    "the analysis confirms that in the intermittent snas , the signature of the transition is a discontinuous change in both the maximal lyapunov exponent and in the variance .",
    "the chaotic component on the intermittent sna is long lived . as a consequence ,",
    "a slow positive tail in the p(n,@xmath71 ) and a resulting power - law decay for f@xmath78(n ) can be identified .",
    "for the other snas , the resulting exponential decay for f@xmath78(n ) has been identified .",
    "this work forms of a department of science and technology , government of india research project .",
    "a. v. wishes to acknowledge council of scientific and industrial research , government of india , for financial support .",
    "in order to distinguish the smooth and the fractal torus ( sna and chaos ) , we examine the attractor with reference to the phase @xmath35 of the external force .",
    "eventhough , no exponential divergence of orbits exists for both the smooth and the fractal torus ( sna ) , they are different from each other in terms of the phase sensitivity .",
    "pikovsky and feudal @xcite have shown that how two points on the sna which have close @xmath35 values separate from each other by introducing the following phase sensitivity exponent : to appreciate this , we note that the absolute value of the first derivative of the orbit@xmath79 fluctuates with time and some times has large bursts.to see this , one can proceed as follows .",
    "an aribitarary large burst can appear when the system is iterated for infinite time steps . by differentiating ( 3 ) , one obtains @xmath80 so , starting from a suitable initial derivative @xmath81 , one can obtain derivatives at all points of the trajectory @xmath82 \\right \\ } + \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1 } \\left ( -(a-3x_{i}^2){\\partial x_0 \\over \\partial { \\theta } } \\right ) , \\eqno(a.2)\\ ] ] with the condition that for @xmath83 , @xmath84=1 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] naturally , in the case of a smooth attractor if one iterates ( a.1 ) and ( a.2 ) starting from aribitrary values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and for large @xmath41 , they converge to the attractor and its derivative , respectively .",
    "thus , partial sums @xmath87 computed from ( a.2 ) are bounded by the maximum derivative @xmath88 along the attractor .",
    "but in the case of fractal attractor , the attractor is nonsmooth and the derivative @xmath88 does not exist , so the consideration above is no longer valid .",
    "these can be illustrated by calculating the partial sums @xmath87 as given by ( a.2 ) .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the behviour of the sum can be very intermittent .",
    "the key observation is that these sums are quite large and practically unbounded .",
    "hence , we plot the maximum of @xmath89 , @xmath90 the value of @xmath91 grows with @xmath41 , which means that arbitararily large values of @xmath89 apppear . from this",
    "it follows immediately that the attractor can not have finite derivative with respect to the external phase if the attractor is nonsmooth .",
    "consequently , the assumption of a finite derivative is inconsistent with the relation ( a.2 ) , where the second term on the rhs is exponentially small and the first term on the rhs can be arbitrary large .",
    "thus , calculating the partial sums ( a.2 ) , we can distinguish strange ( sums are unbounded ) and nonstrange ( sums are bounded ) attractor .",
    "the growth rate of the partial sums with time represents a degree of strangeness of the attractor , and can be used as a quantitaive characteristic of snas . for this purpose , we require a quantity which is independent of a particular trajectory while it represents average properties of the attractor .",
    "the appropriate quantity seems @xcite to be the minimum value of @xmath92 with respect to randomly chosen initial points @xmath93 : @xmath94 it allows a more reliable inference about whether the attractor is nonsmooth .",
    "one can also infer from ( a.4 ) that @xmath36 grows infinitely for a sna with some relations as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a postive quantity which characterises the sna and we call it the phase sensitivity exponent .",
    "however , in the case of a chaotic attractor , it grows exponentially with @xmath41 .      as the finite  time or local lyapunov exponents ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 )",
    "depend on the initial conditions , it will be relevant to consider the variance of the average lyapunov exponent @xmath97 about the @xmath95 s , @xmath98.it is defined @xcite as @xmath99      the variation of the local lyapunov exponents in a fixed time interval @xmath102 can also be discussed by examining the probability distributions @xmath103 for the exponents .",
    "in fact , @xmath103 corresponds to counting the normalized number of times any one of the @xmath71 appears for fixed time @xmath102 .",
    "that is , the distribution of local lyapunov exponents , which is a stationary quantity , is defined as @xcite @xmath104 this is particularly useful in describing the structure and dynamics of nonuniform attractors . in the asymptotic limit @xmath105",
    ", this distribution will collapse to a @xmath66 function , @xmath106 the deviations from this limit for finite times , and the asymptotics , namely the approach to the limit can be very revealing of the underlying dynamics @xcite",
    ".    one can also calculate the arithmetic mean of all the distributions and obtain the variance of the lyapunov exponent @xmath107 as @xmath108 dividing the total length of the orbit into @xmath109 bins as before and defining the local lyapunov exponents as @xmath95 , replacing @xmath110 by @xmath111 , the above equation of variance goes over to the form given by eq .",
    "( a.5 ) .      to quantify the changes in the power spectrum ( obtained using fast fourier transform ( fft ) technique ) , one can compute the so called spectral distribution function @xmath112 , defined to be the number of peaks in the fourier amplitude spectrum larger than some value say @xmath113 .",
    "scaling relations have been predicted for @xmath112 in the case of two and three frequency quasiperiodic attractors and strange nonchaotic attractors .",
    "these scaling relations are @xmath114,@xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , corresponding to the two , three frequency quasiperiodic and strange nonchaotic attractors . in the work of romeiras and ott @xcite ,",
    "the power law exponent was found empirically to lie with in the range @xmath117 for the strange nonchaotic attractor .      to quantify geometric properties of attractors ,",
    "several methods have been used to compute the dimension of the attractors . among them , we have used the correlation dimension ( introduced by grassberger and procaccia @xcite ) in our present study , which may be computed from the correlation function c(r ) defined as @xmath118 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath119 are points on the attractor , h(y ) is the heaviside function ( 1 if y @xmath120 0 and 0 if y @xmath121 0 ) , n is the number of points randomly chosen from the entire data set .",
    "the heaviside function simply counts the number of points within the radius r of the point denoted by @xmath44 and c(r ) gives the average fraction of points .",
    "now the correlation dimension is defined by the variations of c(r ) with r : @xmath122 therefore the correlation dimension ( d ) is the slope of a graph of log c(r ) versus log r. once one obtains the dimensions of the attractors , it will be easy to quantify strange property of the attractors . in all our studies",
