    "shapiro shone microwaves onto a junction and observed the predicted steps ,  @xcite which since then are referred to as _",

    "@xcite    the shapiro steps are a consequence of the interplay between an ac josephson current and a microwave signal .",
    "the observation of shapiro steps does not necessarily require an external microwave generator : when two josephson junctions are electromagnetically coupled like in the classical experiment of giaever ,  @xcite a voltage - biased junction can be used as a microwave source and induce shapiro steps in the current - voltage characteristics ( i - v ) of the other one .",
    "more subtle coupling schemes have been achieved , in which two superconducting weak links placed a few micrometers apart share a common electrode .",
    "shapiro - like steps were then observed in the i - vs , which were attributed to the phase - locking of the josephson frequencies when the dc voltages on two bridges are approximately matched .",
    "@xcite although there is no rigorous microscopic theory of this non - equilibrium effect , it is usually attributed to the diffusion of the quasiparticle charge imbalance generated in and around the weak links .",

    "the idea goes as follows .",
    "inspired by the experiment of ref .",
    "[ ] , let us consider the three - terminal structure shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "it is formed by a diffusive sns junction , and a superconducting tunneling probe s@xmath9 attached to the normal wire .",
    "if one applies a potential difference @xmath10 across the wire , ac currents with a frequency @xmath11 and its harmonics will flow along the n wire .",

    "notice that in this case the steps appear due to the non - equilibrium state created in the diffusive wire . in this region the energy distribution function of quasiparticles",
    "is driven to oscillate at different frequencies by the dc voltages of the leads and the shapiro steps are a result of the beating of these internal josephson frequencies . as illustrated below",

    "finally , it is important to emphasize that these _ voltage - induced shapiro steps _ may appear in a great variety of mesoscopic structures and , as explained below , it constitutes a valuable way to directly test the ac josephson effect .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we remind the basic physics of diffusive sns junctions at finite bias .",
    "section iii is devoted to the description of the theoretical formalism and contains the main technical results . in section",

    "finally , in section v we briefly summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "the effect described above is a consequence of the non - equilibrium properties of diffusive sns junctions .",
    "the physics of these junctions is the result of the interplay between the _ proximity effect _ in the normal wire and the occurrence of _ multiple andreev reflections _ ( mars ) .",
    "the proximity effect is the modification of the properties of a normal metal in contact with a superconductor and it has been extensively studied in diffusive hybrid nanostructures .",
    "@xcite mars are the tunneling processes that dominate the subgap transport in sns junctions . here , successive andreev reflections at both s electrodes lead to a progressive rise of the quasiparticle energy until its energy exceeds the gap energy , @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite the interplay between proximity effect and mars in diffusive sns junctions gives rise to a rich variety of phenomena .",
    "thus for instance , the conductance exhibits a very peculiar subgap structure .",
    "@xcite dubos _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the ac josephson effect by shining microwaves onto a junction , and they observed the appearance of fractional shapiro steps , which is a signature of a non - sinusoidal supercurrent - phase relation . on the other hand , using the setup of fig .",

    "@xcite measured the non - equilibrium distribution function in a long silver wire , where the proximity effect was negligible .",
    "they showed that this function exhibits several steps , which is a manifestation of mars .",
    "the consequences of the interplay between proximity effect and coherent mars in the dissipative current has been addressed theoretically only very recently by using the time - dependent usadel equations .",
    "@xcite this theory describes the crossover from the short junction regime ( @xmath15 ) ,  @xcite where @xmath16 is the wire length , @xmath17 is the superconducting coherence length and @xmath18 the diffusion constant , to the incoherent limit ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xcite the intermediate regime is the relevant one for the observation of the voltage - induced shapiro steps .",
    "we consider the structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , where the position of the tunneling probe along the wire is denoted by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "we assume that the three superconductors ( s@xmath5 , s@xmath6 and s@xmath9 ) have the same energy gap @xmath14 .",

    "we assume the n - s@xmath24 interfaces to be fully transparent and neglect phase - breaking phenomena .",
    "to solve our problem we use the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity for diffusive systems .",

    "it is illustrative to start the discussion of the results with the case of zero - bias ( @xmath73 ) . in this limit",
    "there are no shapiro steps , but the dc current exhibits a supercurrent peak at v=0 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ zero - bias ] , where we plot the dc current through a probe located on @xmath74 for different wire lengths .",
    "@xcite apart from the supercurrent , the main feature of these i - v curves is the presence of a gap , which is equal to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the well - known minigap present in the n wire due to proximity effect ( see for instance fig . 1 in ref .  ) .",

    "now , we turn to the case of finite bias @xmath10 . to give a first impression of how the steps would appear in an experiment",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ dc - current](a ) the total contribution to the dc current , i.e. background current plus shapiro steps , for @xmath81 , @xmath74 and three different values of the voltage @xmath10 .",
    "notice that since we are assuming that the system is voltage biased , the shapiro steps appear as peaks in the current , rather than steps as in a current - biased contact .",
    "@xcite we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ dc - current ] both the distribution function and the non - equilibrium spectral function , which determine the shape of the background current .",
    "the first two peaks in the i - v at @xmath82 could simply be viewed as the supercurrent peaks that correspond to the condition of equality between the potentials of the probe s@xmath47 and of one of the reservoirs s@xmath24 . however , their height depends on @xmath10 and they are smaller than the critical current at @xmath73 because the quasiparticles in the wire are out of equilibrium .",
    "notice , also , the large sub - gap current , which is absent in fig .  [ zero - bias ] .",
    "more obvious manifestations of the interference of ac josephson currents are the higher - order shapiro steps , which appear at voltages that do not correspond to the alignment of the potential of s@xmath47 to that of a reservoir . in fig .",
    "[ dc - current](a ) , they are clearly seen at @xmath83 at the lowest voltage ( @xmath84 ) , but they progressively disappear as @xmath10 increases .",

    "indeed , one can show that in this setup the following relation holds : @xmath90 for @xmath91 , which can be seen in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ space ] .",
    "the most remarkable features of fig .  [ space ] are the following .",
    "first , the step @xmath92 is of the same order as the critical current at @xmath73 , although a bit smaller .",
    "second , due to the biasing in this setup ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) , the step @xmath92 vanishes close the left electrode .",
    "the same happens with the steps @xmath93 at both boundaries because we are assuming that the electrodes are ideal bulk reservoirs .",
    "third , the higher - order steps ( @xmath94 ) are , for this particular voltage @xmath10 , at least an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath92 .",
    "finally , with respect to the length dependence , the steps progressively disappear as @xmath16 increases . for a given position , they decay roughly as @xmath95 for @xmath62 , which is the usual decay of induced superconducting correlations in a normal diffusive system .",
    "however , for @xmath16 of the order of @xmath17 , the dependence is not neccesarily monotonous , as it can be seen for the steps @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "( color online ) height of the shapiro steps at zero temperature as a function of the position of the probe ( @xmath20 ) for @xmath86 and different wire lengths . ]    the other crucial parameter that controls the height of the steps is the voltage @xmath10 . as eq .",
    "( [ ac - components ] ) shows , in order to have a step at @xmath88 ( @xmath4 odd ) , one needs to have a non - zero component @xmath61_{0,m}$ ] .",
    "such an ac component is related to the coherent transfer of @xmath98 cooper pairs through the sns junction , which requires the occurrence of coherent mars of at least order @xmath99 .",
    "an @xmath99-order process contributes significantly for voltages @xmath100 and its probability decreases as the voltage increases .",
    "thus , one naively expects ( i ) high - order ( @xmath101 ) steps to be more clearly visible at low bias @xmath10 and that ( ii ) at voltages @xmath102 , only the steps @xmath103 survive .",
    "indeed , these expectations are confirmed by the calculations , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ voltage ] , where we show the height of the first two steps ( for positive voltages ) as a function of @xmath10 for different wire lengths and a probe located on @xmath74 .",
    "notice that the step @xmath92 reaches its maximum at @xmath104 and then decays very slowly as the voltage increases whereas @xmath96 vanishes rapidly for voltages above the gap .",

    "in summary , we have predicted the possibility to generate parametrically shapiro steps in multi - terminal superconducting structures by tuning the voltages in the reservoirs . we have illustrated this effect with detailed calculations for the case a diffusive sns system with a third electrode coupled to the n region through a tunnel junction .",
    "our results , based on the solution of the time - dependent usadel equations , show that these voltage - induced steps are a direct manifestation of the ac josephson effect in the sns junction and they are visible as long as there are sizable superconducting correlations induced in the n wire .",
