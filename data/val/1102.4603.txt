    "direct measurements of the primary cosmic rays ( cr ) with energies @xmath3 ev are generally difficult due to their exceedingly low flux . instead , their properties are reconstructed from the shape and particle content of the extensive air showers ( eas ) they produce in the atmosphere .",
    "the reconstruction is based on numerical models of the air shower development . as there is currently no reliable fundamental theory describing soft hadronic interactions at high energies , large systematic uncertainties limit the precision of the results .",
    "most current hadronic interaction models use gribov - regge theory @xcite of multi - pomeron exchange between nucleons as the basis for the treatment of high - energy , soft interactions , which are prevalent in air showers .",
    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) can describe hard interactions with high p@xmath4 , which are rare in cosmic ray interactions , but become more important at higher energies .",
    "in addition , diffractive interactions , collisions of nuclei , and interactions and decays of all possible secondary particles at energies from mev to beyond @xmath5 ev are needed for a complete simulation of an air shower .",
    "the generalisation from nucleon - nucleon to hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions is usually performed via the glauber - gribov formalism @xcite , taking into account inelastic screening and low mass diffraction effects .",
    "particle tracking and electromagnetic interactions are straight forward to simulate .",
    "the major problem is the seamless and coherent combination of the different parts of hadronic models .",
    "different numerical codes implement the same theoretical ideas in different ways , with approximate agreement at lower energies where collider data are used for tuning , but diverging in the region where extrapolations are required , e.g. to ultra high energies , or to very forward emission directions .",
    "an important aspect of the analysis of experimental data , is the estimation of systematic uncertainties of air shower observables , due to imperfections of the current interaction models .",
    "the sensitivity of the simulated eas observables to various extrapolations of characteristics of hadronic interactions , such as the inelastic cross section , the multiplicity of secondary particles or the relative energy loss of the leading ( most energetic ) hadrons , towards very high energies has been recently investigated in @xcite . while that study is certainly very illustrative , the variations considered can hardly be achieved in realistic models , without being in contradiction with available accelerator data or with fundamental principles of the quantum field theory .",
    "for example , one of the options investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite assumed the inelastic hadron - nucleus cross section to rise asymptotically as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the square of the c.m .",
    "energy of the collision ) , thus violating the unitarity bound .    in the present work",
    "a different strategy is chosen .",
    "we investigate the potential spread in the high energy extrapolations of hadronic interaction characteristics and the related uncertainties of air shower simulations within a particular model framework .",
    "we quantify the uncertainties of the model , by varying some crucial model parameters within the limits allowed by accelerator data . in this way",
    ", we also take into account the correlations between different interaction characteristics . for example , constraints on the rise of the total proton - proton cross section with energy come also from the data on the pseudorapidity ( @xmath8 ) density of secondary charged hadrons . the main question addressed here",
    "are how uncertain predictions can be ( within a particular model ) and if the uncertainties can cover the differences between currently available monte carlo generators of hadronic interactions .",
    "for our study we chose the latest version of the qgsjet model , qgsjet - ii-3 ( @xcite , released in 2006 ) , because qgsjet describes quite well a large set of experimental air shower data at energies from 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10 ev .",
    "additionally , qgsjet - ii provides a microscopic treatment of nonlinear interaction effects in hadronic and nuclear collisions , described by pomeron - pomeron interaction diagrams , which become very important at very high energies .",
    "we construct a number of alternative parameter sets ( options 2 to 6 ) for the model and compare the results obtained with the standard qgsjet - ii ( option 1 ) and with two models often used in air shower physics , namely sibyll 2.1 @xcite and epos 1.99 @xcite .",
    "while the original sibyll was based on the `` minijet '' idea , ascribing the energy evolution of the interaction cross section and particle production solely to the contribution of hard processes ( minijet emission ) , the actual model version is rather similar to the gribov - regge - type models .",
    "a crucial difference between qgsjet - ii and sibyll 2.1 is that parton saturation effects in sibyll are modelled by means of an energy - dependent cutoff for the minijet production .",
    "epos employs a phenomenological approach for nonlinear interaction effects , while addressing an important problem of energy and momentum correlations between multiple scattering processes at the amplitude level @xcite .",
    "epos has a significantly larger number of adjustable parameters than qgsjet - ii , but a substantially larger set of accelerator data has been used for its calibration .",
    "the distinctive feature of epos is the enhanced production of baryons , which leads to more energy in the muonic component of showers @xcite .",
    "the standard versions of all these models are available in the framework of the latest corsika air shower simulation package @xcite .",
    "among the crucial parameters responsible for the high energy extrapolation of the model are those related to inelastic diffraction , the relative contributions of soft and hard processes , and the distribution of energy and momentum between secondary particles . to investigate the corresponding allowed parameter range , five versions ( options 2 - 6 ) of the qgsjet - ii model have been created , with varying parameter settings , which are tuned to reproduce ( within experimental accuracy ) _ the same set _ of accelerator data as used for the original model calibration .",
    "the new data obtained at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have not yet been used in the analysis .",
    "the effects of the parameter variations are then investigated for both single interactions and air showers as a whole .",
    "option 1 corresponds to the standard parameter settings of qgsjet - ii ( see tab .",

    "both , projectile and target nucleons can undergo low - mass diffraction excitation .",
    "the latter is treated in qgsjet - ii in the framework of the good - walker - like multi - channel eikonal approach @xcite : a hadron is represented by a superposition of a number of elastic scattering eigenstates which undergo different absorption , depending on their relative strength @xmath14 for the interaction . for the 2-component scheme realised in qgsjet - ii , the ratio @xmath15 defines thus the strength of diffraction , which rises for more asymmetric superposition ( larger @xmath15 ) and disappears for @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , a stronger diffraction implies also stronger inelastic screening effects which reduce the predicted total and inelastic cross sections .",
    "the parameters are varied in two different ways to increase the proportion of diffractive events and influence the rise with energy of total inelastic hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus cross sections . in the default version of qgsjet - ii ( option 1 )",
    "the corresponding ratios are @xmath17 for protons and @xmath18 and 5.7 for pions and kaons respectively .",
    "the corresponding low mass diffraction cross section for the incident hadron changes between 0.9 and 1.6 mb for proton - proton and between 1.2 and 1.7 mb for pion - proton interactions in the laboratory energy range of @xmath19 to @xmath20 gev . in option 2",
    "we enhance low - mass diffraction by choosing @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , while in option 6 we leave proton diffraction unchanged but decrease diffraction for pions and kaons , @xmath24 . as an illustration of the discussed modifications , in option 2 the low mass diffraction cross section of the projectile hadron at @xmath19 and @xmath20 gev",
    "is increased to 1.6 and 3.1 mb , respectively , in @xmath25 collisions and to 2.0 and 3.2 mb in @xmath26 interactions .    in the gribov - regge framework",
    ", qgsjet takes into account contributions of both soft and semihard parton cascades . in the latter case , the virtuality ( @xmath27 ) cutoff @xmath28 defines the transition from the non - perturbative soft ( @xmath29 ) to the perturbative hard ( @xmath30 ) part of the cascade",
    "additionally , in qgsjet - ii the shadowing and saturation effects are accounted for by the soft ( @xmath29 ) partons .",
    "thus , the performance of the model depends strongly on this cutoff parameter and on the parton distribution functions obtained from deep inelastic scattering . as the semi - hard contribution rapidly increases with energy",
    ", one can significantly reduce the rise of the cross sections and the secondary particle production with energy when this cut - off is increased from its default value 2.5 gev@xmath13 to 4 gev@xmath13 , as done in option 3",

    "the @xmath8 distributions also allow assessment of the treatment of nuclear interactions in the models , which is important for nuclear composition studies of cosmic rays .",
    "as nitrogen - nitrogen collisions are perfectly symmetric , also the @xmath8 distribution should be symmetric .",
    "in qgsjet nuclear interactions are modelled as two clouds of nucleons penetrating each other and interacting . as the modeling is done in a symmetric way",

    "sibyll models nuclear interactions with the semi - superposition model which treats a nuclear projectile as a superposition of individual nucleons and a nucleus - nucleus collision as a number of independent nucleon - nucleus collisions .",

    "sibyll produces @xmath49 more particles in nitrogen - nitrogen than in p - nitrogen collisions , while for qgsjet and epos this factor is only about 2 .",
    "thus , for composition studies based on differences in the muon yield in showers from different nuclei , it is better to rely on qgsjet or epos .",
    "the large differences in @xmath8 between models and the comparison with first collider data at high energies indicate that some aspects of the models are not correct and need adaptation .",
    "although currently there are only few measurements in the relevant forward region and lhc is not yet running at its maximum energy , lhc results , in particular , the results of the lhcf experiment @xcite provide already constraints to some of the model parameters .",
    "future measurements of the total proton - proton cross section and of particle production at @xmath50 tev will greatly help to tune the models further .",
    "showers were simulated at energies of @xmath1 , @xmath51 and @xmath2 ev , i.e. at typical energies relevant to cherenkov telescopes ( such as hess @xcite , veritas @xcite and magic @xcite ) , small air shower arrays ( such as kascade @xcite and lhaaso @xcite ) , and experiments for the highest energies ( e.g. the telescope array @xcite or the pierre auger observatory @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the first interaction point of the primary particle was fixed at typical values for the respective primary energy , to exclude the effect of shower - to - shower fluctuations due to the varying point of first interaction and to concentrate on differences in average shower shape . for each energy the average longitudinal development and the lateral distribution of particles at ground level",

    "also characteristic observables were evaluated , such as the average values of the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum , @xmath52 , the particle number at the shower maximum , @xmath53 , the cherenkov photon lateral distribution at ground level , the electron - to - muon ratio at ground level , the energy that would be released in an auger - like water cherenkov detector at 1000 m core distances ( @xmath54 ) @xcite and the time in which the integrated signal grows from 10% to 50% , @xmath55 @xcite .",

    "the longitudinal distributions show very good agreement around the shower maximum ( @xmath112550 g / cm@xmath13 ) and differences up to @xmath113% at ground level ( here , 880 g / cm@xmath13 ) .",
    "sibyll lies well within the spread of the qgsjet options , but epos shows much flatter lateral distributions , for both electrons and muons , with many more particles at large distances from the shower core and overall about 20% more muons . at ground level epos",
    "has 15% fewer electrons and 15% more muons than the reference model .",
    "consequently , all energy assignments would be different on the 15 - 20% level and composition analysis were greatly affected by these differences .",
    "they are big enough for the kascade experiment to tell the difference .",
    "indeed , there is evidence from kascade data @xcite that the primary proton spectrum agrees better with direct measurements when qgsjet and sibyll are used for the analysis , than when epos is used .",
    "the lateral distribution of qgsjet option 2 ( enhanced diffraction ) is very similar to that of sibyll at both @xmath51 and @xmath2 ev , suggesting that one of the major differences between the two models is the rate of diffraction .",
    "however differences can be seen between option 2 and sibyll in the results of single particle interactions , indicating that there are other important physical distinctions .

    "the energy is then determined from the density at some distance @xcite .",
    "the time structure of the shower front , measured in the array detectors , carries information on the shower development and the primary mass . with fluorescence telescopes the longitudinal profile and the position of the shower maximum can be directly measured , from which the energy and the composition can be inferred .",
    "commonly used observables at 10@xmath42 ev are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab-10 ^ 19obs ] .",
    "as expected , the deviations from standard qgsjet are largest at this energy , as the extrapolations of model parameters from collider energies are largest .",
    "deviations in the lateral distributions of electrons and photons are less than + 10% within 1000 m from the shower axis . for muons",
    "the variations within the qgsjet models are less than 20% at 1 km core distance , but all the options produce always smaller muon numbers than the standard qgsjet .",
    "sibyll gives almost the same results for electron and muon lateral distributions as qgsjet option 2 , the version with the enhanced proton diffraction .",
    "again , epos is distinctly different , with 25% more muons at ground level for all core distances .",
    "the qgsjet and sibyll muon numbers at ground are within 0 to -15% of the standard version .",
    "the epos electron numbers at ground are similar to those of the other models , owing to the fact that for the angle chosen the shower maximum is close to the ground . for more inclined showers",
    "larger differences would occur .    in the longitudinal distributions , the qgsjet options 2 , 3 and 4 and sibyll have markedly lower particle numbers and energy deposits ( 40 - 20% ) in the upper part of the shower than the standard .",
    "epos shows a similar trend , again developing slowly early in the shower , but quickly producing larger numbers of muons , with almost 30% more muons at ground level .    to reproduce data from experiments directly measuring muon numbers such as kascade and hires - mia and from the pierre auger observatory , where the muon content can be inferred indirectly @xcite ,",
    "more muons in simulations seem to be required .",
    "epos seems to address the muon deficit problem , but would introduce a significantly different energy scale .",
    "significant differences are also seen in @xmath54 , a common observable used for the energy reconstruction in the @xmath2 ev region ( see tab .",
    "[ tab-10 ^ 19obs ] ) .",
    "the energy reconstruction based on option 2 would give @xmath11210% higher cosmic ray energies than the one using the standard qgsjet option , while epos would give 16% smaller energies .",
    "the differences in average @xmath52 for the qgsjet models are less than 30 g / cm@xmath13 ( 4% ) , with all the models producing deeper @xmath52 values than standard qgsjet .",
    "the differences in @xmath55 , which is used for composition analysis , are less than 5% , with sibyll and epos giving the extreme values .",
    "the analysis of shower simulations demonstrates the increase in systematic uncertainties ( introduced by variation of model parameters ) as the primary particle energy increases , and with it the extrapolation of the models .",
    "our study indicates that parameter variations within one model generally can not reproduce the full variance possible between models .",
    "none of the parameter variations investigated in qgsjet was able to mimic the behaviour of the epos model : at any energy , epos has far more muons than all other models and specifically than the qgsjet standard version .",
    "differences in several observables amount to @xmath146 10% in the tev range and to 20 - 30% in the pev and eev ranges , causing sizeable systematic errors on the energy scale and composition analysis . within qgsjet , at all primary energies the largest effects are observed due to the increase of the rate of diffraction for protons and pions , making diffraction the feature with the largest impact on the overall development of the shower .",
    "epos is a relatively new model and still has to prove its qualities by being compared in detail to results from different ( past and present ) experiments from tev to eev energies .",
    "the lateral and longitudinal distribution pattern of the electromagnetic and muonic components in air showers shows complex variations between models , which depend on the energy and the level of shower development , the zenith angle , etc .",
    "therefore , complete simulations of showers , detectors and analysis procedures , using different interaction models are needed for a meaningful data analysis .",
    "the model uncertainties at high energies are of a size that makes analysis of nuclear composition at @xmath147eev energies rather difficult ( with the observables considered here ) , as differences between proton and iron induced showers are not much larger than the uncertainties due to the models . on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainties are large enough that current experiments are able to tell which model fits best . also , new data from lhc and rhic do increasingly constrain the models , and help to make the extrapolation to highest energies more reliable .",
    "but ultimately , only a coherent description of cosmic ray phenomena and hadronic interaction physics over the full energy range will be a convincing proof of the correct interpretation of cosmic ray data .",
