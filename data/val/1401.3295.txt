    "this effect had been previously predicted to arise from the motion of the earth - sun system relative to a wimp dark matter galactic halo engulfing our galaxy @xcite .",
    "this expected annual modulation in interaction rate is arguably the most prominent signature presently available for the positive identification of wimps .",
    "cogent employs p - type point contact ( ppc ) germanium detectors @xcite for this purpose .",

    "an early cogent prototype , operated in a shallow underground site @xcite , excluded the last region of low - mass wimp parameter space ( wimp mass , nuclear scattering cross - section ) able to account for the dama / libra modulation , under the premise of a local galactic halo described by an isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution , the simplest approximation to the motion of these particles @xcite .",
    "a search for an annual modulation induced by dark matter particle interactions , a subtle few - percent variation in the low - energy interaction rate , is a challenging endeavor .",
    "it requires excellent long - term stability in the entire detector system .",
    "we have recently discussed these difficulties within the context of our experiment , concluding that the necessary conditions seem present @xcite . in this same publication , we described an improved approach at discriminating against backgrounds affecting the surface layers of the detector .",

    "surface events are observed to produce considerably larger values of @xmath3 than energy depositions taking place within the bulk of the germanium crystal ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the long exposure accumulated by the ppc at sul has allowed us to characterize the rise - time distributions of these two populations .",
    "these distributions can be described by log - normal functions , a choice justified by simulations of the effect of electronic noise on rise - time determination , and electronic pulser calibrations @xcite .",

    "fig .  3 displays the @xmath3 distributions for events passing software cuts against microphonics and other spurious pulses @xcite , for two energy regions .",
    "the first , spanning the range 0.5 - 2.0 kevee , goes from analysis threshold to the approximate endpoint of an exponential excess of bulk events with presently unknown origin @xcite .",

    "log - normal fits to fast ( bulk ) events are indicated in red , slow ( surface ) events in blue , and their sum is a dotted line . ]    for the purposes of the present analysis , we further divide these two energy regions into  pure \" bulk and  pure \" surface events , separated at the approximate value of @xmath3 for which the probability of belonging to either the fast or slow signal populations is the same ( 0.7 @xmath6s for 0.5 - 2.0 kevee , and 0.6 @xmath6s for 2.0 - 4.5 kevee , fig .  3 ) .",
    "in doing so , the fast signal acceptance ( sa ) for the  pure \" bulk 0.5 - 2.0 kevee events is 92.2% , whereas the slow signal background rejection ( br ) is 93.1% , leading to a @xmath013.6% contamination of this group by surface backgrounds . for the  pure \" surface 0.5 - 2.0 kevee group ,",

    "the decay associated to cosmogenic activation in germanium and cryostat materials @xcite is evident in this long exposure .",
    "it is particularly apparent for the 0.5 - 2.0 kevee bulk group , which contains the majority of l - shell ec signals , readily observable as peaks in the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "their contribution is calculable through monitoring of the higher - intensity k - shell ec peaks populating the 4.5 - 11.5 kevee energy range @xcite , and use of well - characterized l / k ec ratios @xcite .",

    "similarly , the peak date associated to @xmath26 365 days for this group of events is @xmath29 days .",

    "green lines show this power for oscillations of the two dominant k - shell ec signals around their exponential decays . ]",
    "this straightforward treatment , which incorporates an improved discrimination against surface backgrounds compared to our previous analyses , confirms our earlier indication of an annual modulation in cogent data @xcite , exclusively for the subset of events liable to contain a low - mass wimp dark matter signal .",
    "its significance is modest in the present unoptimized form of analysis : using the likelihood ratio method described in @xcite the hypothesis of an annual modulation being present in the low - energy bulk group is preferred to the null hypothesis ( no modulation ) at the @xmath32 level @xcite .",
    "however , this frequentist approach does not take into consideration information from dama / libra and other searches as a prior , specifically the potential relevance of the modulation amplitude favored by cogent , a subject developed next . in this respect ,",
    "we call attention to incipient applications of bayesian methodology in this area @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper focuses on the possibility of using our observations to obtain a common phenomenological interpretation of recent intriguing results in direct searches for dark matter .",
    "a best - fit value of @xmath33% is observed for the low - energy bulk group when the l - shell ec contribution is subtracted directly ( top panel in fig .",
    "if a free @xmath22 is allowed ( second panel in the figure ) , this becomes @xmath34% .",
    "if the irreducible low - energy excess in the cogent spectrum is considered to be the response to a @xmath58 gev / c@xmath2 wimp , it would account for @xmath35% of the bulk events in the 0.5 - 2.0 kevee region , the rest arising from a flat component originating mainly in compton scattering of gamma backgrounds ( see discussion around fig .",
    "23 in @xcite ) .",
    "this fraction is approximate , as it can change some with choice of background model , and of rise - time cuts leading to slight variations in the irreducible  pure \" bulk spectrum .",
    "this putative wimp signal would then be oscillating with an annually - modulated fractional amplitude in the range between @xmath36% and @xmath37% .",
    "this is larger by a factor @xmath38 than the @xmath39% expected for a wimp of this mass in this germanium energy region , when the zeroth - order approximation of an isotropic maxwellian halo is adopted @xcite .",
    "a growing consensus is that a maxwellian description of the motion of dark matter particles in the local halo , the so - called standard halo model ( shm ) , is incomplete , as it excludes several expected halo components , e.g. , tidal streams @xcite , debris flows @xcite , extragalactic components @xcite , a dark disk @xcite , and other sources of anisotropies @xcite .",
    "these can have a large effect on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in particular for low wimp masses .",
    "for @xmath40 gev / c@xmath2 , present detectors would be sensitive only to the highest velocities in the local halo velocity distribution @xcite .",

    "8) , later reinforced by other experiments .",
    "unlike the other searches generating anomalies and rois in fig .  8 , the dama / libra spectrum shows no characteristic spectral excess next to threshold ( fig .",

    "if confirmed , would push dama / libra",
    "s @xmath41 into the range @xmath56650 km / s , for which a large fractional modulation is expected from essentially all halo models @xcite , imposing a reduction in @xmath47 for the dama / libra roi similar to that shown in fig .",
    "8 . also susceptible to @xmath49",
    "is the potential relevance of the small shift in @xmath24 between cogent and dama / libra , given the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath42 highlighted in @xcite ( a similar shift being already noticeable within dama / libra data when examined for different @xmath42 regions @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational focusing @xcite can also affect the value of @xmath24 for different detectors .",
    "finally , a lower @xmath47 for dama / libra , as suggested by the discussion above , would ease concerns about the ability of its spectrum to accommodate a dark matter signal @xcite .",
    "to summarize , following an improvement in our ability to separate bulk and surface signals , we report a continued preference for an annual modulation appearing in the bulk counting rate from a low - background ppc germanium detector , in a region of the energy spectrum exhibiting an exponential excess of unknown origin . examined alone , its statistical significance is modest ( 2.2 @xmath57 in the basic form of analysis presented here ) .",

    "when a wimp origin is considered , the favored dark matter particle mass corresponds to a region of present interest in indirect searches @xcite and numerous particle models @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the large fractional amplitude of the observed modulation would entail a non - maxwellian component for the local galactic halo .",
    "this property can potentially bring all reported wimp detector anomalies into agreement .",
    "we emphasize once more the difficult nature of the search we have described . presently unknown backgrounds and/or instrumental effects",
    "could mimic an annual modulation signature in dark matter detectors .",
    "however , a coherent picture may be starting to emerge from present anomalies in direct searches for dark matter : in combination with other results , it should be possible to use the present cogent dataset to constrain the local velocity structure of a hypothetical galactic wimp halo , an exercise in embryonic  wimp astronomy \" .",

    "separately , we find that the periodogram is not a good indicator of the persistence of a possible modulation over the entire time span examined .",

    "earlier @xcite we found a slightly larger significance ( 2.8@xmath57 ) from a live - time exposure a factor 2.5 times smaller than examined here . at first sight , and leaving possible statistical fluctuations aside , this might seem against expectations .",
    "however , the much more restrictive rise - time cut ( @xmath59 ) presently applied to extract a subset of `` pure '' bulk events results in a marginal increase of their statistics in the present cumulative dataset .",
    "namely , the 0.5 - 2.0 kevee `` bulk '' sample size in @xcite was composed of 1,766 events , and is now 2,264 events .",
    "for the important 0.5 - 1.0 kevee energy range , where a low - mass wimp would be expected to dominate , these are 830 and 624 events respectively , i.e. , an actual decrease in available statistics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising , from a purely statistical point of view , not to have observed an increase in modulation significance . a comparison between the top panels in fig .  5 here and in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite indicates that the similar modulation observed in @xcite was indeed dominated by events with @xmath59 .",
    "decomposing the dataset into smaller pre - fire and post - fire periods , the preference is 1.6 @xmath57 and 1.2 @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "this preference is penalized for the post - fire subset by the fluctuations visible in the top panels of fig .  5 around 1,005 and 1,125 days (",
    "no anomalous behavior was observed during those periods ) . at the time of this writing",
