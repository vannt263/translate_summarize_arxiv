    "interdisciplinary research has recently gained a central role in the advancement of science , leading to important achievements  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the 2014 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to two physicists and a physical chemist , for  a physical technique , developed with help from chemistry , that helps illuminate problems in biology \"  .    even though several definitions and metrics for interdisciplinarity have been proposed @xcite ,",
    "citation impact metrics accounting for this aspect of scientific research have not been defined yet .    on the other hand ,",
    "funding agencies have created specific calls for interdisciplinary projects , like the interdisciplinary programs funded by the national science foundation  .",
    "the european research council explicitly encourages applications from scientists having published in multidisciplinary journals  , and the evaluation criteria for the marie curie fellowships also include the interdisciplinary aspects of the research  .",
    "consequently , there is significant need to evaluate projects and scholars by considering interdisciplinarity too .",
    "the difficulties in evaluating interdisciplinary research constitute a pressing controversy that leads many young scholars to remain on more traditional tracks , because the risks associated to undertaking an interdisciplinary career path seem too high  @xcite .",
    "this work addresses the issue of quantifying interdisciplinarity by proposing a method to rank scientific publications ( such as papers and patents ) and their producers ( scholars , inventors , institutions , companies and countries ) according to their scientific impact and its breadth over different scientific disciplines .",
    "the method is based on the detection of the most central elements of a complex bipartite interconnected multilayer network representing scientific producers and scientific citations within and across different fields .",
    "the citation network is composed of multiple layers , each representing a scientific discipline .",
    "accounting for this diversity  instead of neglecting the information it provides by building an aggregated representation of the network  allows to unveil the cross - disciplinary versatility of scientific publications and of their producers , and therefore to obtain a quantitative measure of their interdisciplinary scientific impact .",
    "since the seminal work of de solla price  @xcite and garfield  @xcite , scientists have put a great effort into trying to understand the patterns of citation distributions  @xcite and the non - trivial dynamics of scientific recognition  @xcite .",
    "this fundamental body of work has the ultimate goal of setting the basis for the definition of more accurate and fairer scientific impact metrics used for evaluation purposes .    in the last decades",
    ", several indices have been presented .",
    "they are based on the idea that we can quantify the impact of a scientific publication by counting the number of citations it has received over the years .",
    "a widely adopted indicator to evaluate scholars scientific impact is the h - index  @xcite ( a scholar has an index @xmath0 if @xmath0 of her / his publications have received at least @xmath0 citations each ) , and its numerous variants  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a different approach has been proposed .",
    "building networks that reconstruct the chains of scientific citations allows for a global understanding of the intrigued patterns of citations between publications  or between producers .",
    "this representation allows to unveil the difference between , for instance , a publication that has received 10 citations coming from highly cited publications , and a publication that has received 10 citations too , but from low - cited papers .",
    "the two have the same number of citations but the former has clearly had a higher impact . to rank publications , journals or scholars according to their importance in the respective citation network",
    ", researchers have proposed diffusion algorithms that simulate the spreading of scientific credits on the network  @xcite . in practice , this is the same idea at the basis of the pagerank , i.e the algorithm that google uses to rank the pages of the world wide web  @xcite .",
    "and @xmath1 .",
    "if we discard the information about the scientific fields and consider the aggregated network shown in panel a , then the two authors centrality would be the same , because they authored the same number of papers , having an identical structure of incoming citations .",
    "however , the multilayer framework takes into account that one of @xmath1 s papers pertains to both physics and biology , and , moreover , had an impact in both fields ( one citation comes from a physics paper and the other from a biology one ) . therefore @xmath1 has a higher versatility than @xmath2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this work , we propose to rank scientific publications and their producers employing the pagerank defined on a bipartite interconnected multilayer structure that accounts for citations within and across different disciplines .",
    "this is equivalent to ranking nodes according to their _ versatility _",
    "@xcite on an interconnected multilayer network  @xcite .    to account for interdisciplinarity",
    ", we define a bipartite interconnected multilayer network representing citations between publications ( papers or patents ) and relations between publications and their manufacturers ( scholars , inventors , research institutions , companies or countries ) .",
    "given @xmath3 nodes and @xmath4 layers , the rank@xmath5 multilayer adjacency tensor @xmath6 is defined in the following way .",
    "let @xmath7 be the rank@xmath8 adjacency tensor encoding information about the relationship between layer @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 indicates the intensity of the relationship between node @xmath12 in layer @xmath9 and node @xmath13 in layer @xmath10 , and @xmath14 indicates the rank@xmath8 tensor that represents the canonical basis in the space @xmath15 ( note that when @xmath16 , @xmath17 represents the intra - layer adjacency tensor ) , then @xmath18 where @xmath19 indicates the rank@xmath8 tensor that represents the canonical basis in the space @xmath20 .",
    "this is the general formulation of an adjacency tensor representing a multilayer network .    to build our network we consider @xmath21 nodes ( where @xmath22 is the number of publications , and @xmath23 the number of manufacturers of the chosen type that produced the @xmath22 papers",
    "therefore , given the ordered set of nodes @xmath24 , the first @xmath22 elements @xmath25 represent publication , and the other @xmath23 elements @xmath26 represent manufacturers .",
    "moreover , we consider @xmath27 layers , where @xmath28 is the number of scientific disciplines that the publications belong to .",
    "the 4 components of the rank@xmath8 adjacency tensor @xmath29 are defined as follows .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 $ ] , encode information about publication citations .",
    "each layer represents a discipline or a subfield , therefore @xmath33 if both publications @xmath34 and @xmath35 belong to discipline @xmath36 , and publication @xmath34 cites publication @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the number of disciplines that publication @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) belongs to .",
    "this normalisation is performed so that every citation carries one unit of value overall .",
    "interdisciplinary citations are instead encoded by @xmath31 ; @xmath39 if publications",
    "@xmath34 belongs to discipline @xmath36 and @xmath35 to discipline @xmath40 , and publication @xmath34 cites publication @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the remaining layer , then the tensors @xmath42 , with @xmath43 $ ] , encode information about the relation between publications and their manufacturers , _",
    "i.e. _ if the chosen type of manufacturer is scholars , then @xmath44 if author @xmath35 is one of the authors of publication @xmath34 .",
    "if we consider research institutions , we connect each publication to the institutions to which its authors are affiliated ; if we consider countries , the connections are to the countries in which these institutions are based . finally , we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be zero tensors .",
    "@xmath45 tensors are null because we do not want the relations between publications and manufacturers to be symmetric , to avoid unrealistic paths to take place when computing the nodes centrality .",
    "@xmath46 is null because all the information is already encoded in the other tensors : we do not need to explicitly add citation edges between authors .    in this framework , for the citation layers ,",
    "each node is active on a given layer if and only if the publication it represents belongs to the corresponding field .",
    "for example , a monodisciplinary publication is active only on one layer , whereas an interdisciplinary publication , pertaining to both physics and biology , is active on two layers . as a consequence , a publication",
    "whose impact is restricted to only one discipline has intra - layer incoming edges only , whereas a publication that has influenced the work of researchers in more than one field has inter - layer incoming edges too , which represent the bridges between the different fields involved .",
    "therefore this framework allows for a natural representation of the interdisciplinarity degree of a publication .",
    "being our goal to rank publication producers too , we introduce in the network a second type of nodes , which , according to the specific need , represent scholars , inventors , research institutions , or countries .",
    "these nodes are active on a dedicated layer , and each publication has directed outgoing inter - layer edges pointing to each of its producers .",
    "previous works on ranking producers are based on one - mode projections of the bipartite network of publications and producers , whereas in this work we prefer to take advantage of the complete bipartite structure in order to avoid any information loss , as further detailed in the supplementary material .    on the proposed network",
    ", the ranking is obtained through a process of diffusion of scientific credits from paper to paper through citation edges within and across disciplines .",
    "producers are the sinks of this diffusion process , being represented by nodes with no outgoing edges , and incoming edges originated from the papers they have produced .",
    "a schematic representation of the proposed network is shown in figure  [ explicative - figure ] .",
    "having defined the multilayer citation network , we propose to rank its nodes according to their pagerank versatility , which is given by the steady - state solution of the equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the time - dependent tensor that gives the probability to find a random walker at a particular node @xmath49 in a particular layer @xmath50 , and @xmath51 \\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath3 being the number of nodes in the network , @xmath4 the number of layers , and @xmath52 the teleportation rate .",
    "@xmath53 denotes the rank@xmath5 tensor of transition probabilities for jumping between pairs of nodes and switching between pairs of layers , and @xmath54 is the rank@xmath5 tensor with all components equal to 1 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the eigentensor of the transition tensor @xmath56 , denoting the steady - state probability to find a random walker in node @xmath49 and layer @xmath50 .",
    "the tensor @xmath55 provides the pagerank of each node ( @xmath49 ) in each layer ( @xmath50 ) : it is crucial to remark here that this is not equivalent to calculate the pagerank in each layer separately , because our formulation accounts for the whole interconnected structure to solve the eigenvalue problem . to obtain the multilayer pagerank of each node ,",
    "regardless of the layer , we project the values obtained from its replicas in different layers , obtaining the multilayer pagerank vector @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vector with all components equal to 1 .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that this operation provides the same results that would be obtained by calculating pagerank by means of simulated random walkers that explore the multilayer structure according to transition rules encoded in @xmath56 .",
    "to illustrate the proposed ranking method , we test it on two case studies : the american physical society ( aps ) and the us patents datasets .    the first is a collection of papers published in the journals of the american physical society ( physical review letters , physical review and review of modern physics ) between 1985 and 2009  .",
    "we restricted the analysis only to papers with at most ten authors , to avoid biases due to the papers of experimental high - energy physics in which all the project collaborators are listed as co - authors . to disambiguate author s name",
    ", we used a simple technique introduced in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "meta - data in the dataset provide information about the topic of the papers through the specification of the assigned `` physics and astronomy classification scheme '' ( pacs ) code , developed by the american institute of physics ( aip ) and used in physical review since 1975 to identify fields and sub - fields of physics  .",
    "we exploited this information to build a heterogeneous interconnected 10-layer network in which each layer represents a sub - field of physics , as defined by the pacs systems : _ general _ ; _ the physics of elementary particles and fields _ ; _ nuclear physics _ , _ atomic and molecular physics _ ; _ electromagnetism , optics , acoustics , heat transfer , classical mechanics , and fluid dynamics _ ; _ physics of gases , plasmas , and electric discharges _ ; _ condensed matter : structural , mechanical and thermal properties _ ; _ condensed matter : electronic structure , electrical , magnetic , and optical properties _ ; _ interdisciplinary physics and related areas of science and technology _ ; _ geophysics , astronomy , and astrophysics_. from the paper meta - data we also extracted the authors affiliation information , which allowed us to associate to each paper a list of ( one or more ) institutions and countries .",
    "the final dataset consists of 319816 papers , 204809 authors , 626 institutions and 54 countries .",
    "arguably , the aps dataset covers only physics , but note that physics is a vast field that spans from biological physics to astrophysics and although it may fall short of a full interdisciplinary analysis it is clear that this is a powerful indicator of multi - topic analysis that serves to proof the usefulness of the method .",
    "the second dataset contains the u.s .",
    "patents granted between january 1963 and december 1999 , and all citations made to these patents between 1975 and 1999  . to define the layers",
    ", we used the 6 categories proposed in previous studies  @xcite : _ chemical ( excluding drugs ) _ ; _ computers and communications _ ; _ drugs and medical _ ; _ electrical and electronics _ ; _ mechanical _ ; _ others_. each patent is assigned to one main class defined by the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , and to any number of subsidiary classes .",
    "each class belongs to one of the listed categories , therefore each patent is associated with one or more layer according to its classes .",
    "however , the dataset only contains the information about the main class , therefore we complemented it by extracting the information about the other classes from the uspto patent grant full text  .",
    "the final dataset contains 1574882 patents , 1142499 inventors , 138833 assignees ( i.e. corporations for the most part ) , and 127 countries .",
    "figure  2 shows the evolution of the interdisciplinary ranking of the world top physics departments , and of the world top companies , over time . this visualization allows to observe , for instance , the raise of the university of texas at austin during the 1990s , after the establishment , in 1985 , of the center for nonlinear dynamics , funded and directed by the boltzmann medal laureate harry swinney  .",
    "compared to previously proposed algorithms of diffusion of scientific credit , the proposed method rewards researchers that have carried out interdisciplinary works or have had an impact in different scientific areas . to show this , we first compare it with the science author rank algorithm ( sara )  @xcite .",
    "we find that the rankings of aps authors obtained using sara and using the proposed method have a spearman s rank correlation of 0.77 ( @xmath59 confidence level ) .",
    "the high value of correlation is to be expected since both methods rank researchers simulating a diffusion process on a citation network .",
    "however , the proposed method gives higher ranking to versatile researchers such as the self - organised criticality pioneer per bak ( + 21 positions gained ) , econophysics co - founder eugene stanley ( + 56 ) , complex networks pioneer shlomo havlin ( + 104 ) , and complex systems professor leonard m. sander ( + 93 ) .",
    "we show that the proposed method is in fact able to capture two fundamental aspects of interdisciplinary research : intrinsic multidisciplinarity ( i.e. publishing papers or patents pertaining to different areas ) on the one hand , and effective interdisciplinarity , i.e. being credited by different scientific areas , on the other .",
    "we define the _ topical interdisciplinarity _",
    "@xmath60 of an author @xmath2 ( who could be a scholar or an inventor ) as the average number of different scientific areas her / his publications pertain to , i.e. : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of publications authored by @xmath2 , and @xmath63 is the number of fields that publication @xmath64 belongs to .",
    "moreover , for each publication @xmath65 we define an entropy metrics based on the distribution of its incoming citations across the different fields represented by the different layers : @xmath66 where the sum is over the different fields ( layers ) and @xmath67 is the proportion of edges incident in @xmath65 that come from layer @xmath34 . therefore if a publication is only cited by other publications belonging to its own field @xmath68 ,",
    "whereas a publication that has received citations from different fields has @xmath69 , and the higher the number of fields it has had impact on , the higher its entropy . for each author @xmath2 we then compute her / his _ citation interdisciplinarity _ @xmath70 as the average entropy of her / his publications : @xmath71    we find a strong positive correlation between the gain in rank that scholars and inventors obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and their topical interdisciplinarity ( figure  3 , panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the rank gain is also positively correlated with the disciplinary diversity of scholars and inventors incoming citations ( figure  3 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . to control for the effects of productivity , i.e. the fact that a researcher that produces more papers has more chances to publish in more areas or to be cited by papers in many different areas , we perform the same analysis on two subsets of the data by considering in each case only authors with a fixed number of publications ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients found in these subsets are consistent with those found using the whole dataset , demonstrating that the proposed method is not biased by productivity .",
    "the results are reported in the supplementary material .",
    "coefficient , and setting the statistical significance at @xmath74 .",
    "solid lines represent density gradient contours , and dashed lines represent linear regression models estimated via maximum - likelihood.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper , we propose a methodology to assess the citation impact of scientific publications and their producers that intrinsically accounts for their interdisciplinarity .",
    "this aspect was not included in previous citation impact indicators .    even though numerous metrics have been proposed to assess citation impact ,",
    "several issues have been raised .",
    "these include the accounting of self - citations  @xcite , the choice of the appropriate citation time window  @xcite , field normalisation  @xcite , and author credit allocation  @xcite . despite the vast literature on the subject",
    ", consensus is still lacking on how to solve these issues . here , we propose a method whose objective is to account for interdisciplinarity , and we do not enter those debates .",
    "however , the bipartite interconnected multilayer networks of citations and disciplines that we introduce can be adapted to take into account specific needs .",
    "for example , edges connecting papers to their authors could be weighted differently to take into account non - homogeneous allocation of credit , or a specific time window could be chosen a priori to select the papers constituting the network .",
    "going beyond the presented assessment of the benefits produced by interdisciplinarity , the method proposed in this work could constitute a tool for funding agencies and academic hiring decision makers to quantify the impact of interdisciplinary research and its producers , for a faster advancement of excellent science .",

    "the idea of ranking scholars simulating a diffusion process was already introduced in @xcite  and previously in @xcite to rank scientific publications  but the approach proposed in this work considers a different kind of network  a bipartite interconnected multilayer network . in this section",
    "we motivate the choice of taking into account the complete bipartite structure instead of its one - mode projection .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will consider a bilayer version of the network .",
    "our focus here is not in fact the multilayer aspect of the network capturing interdisciplinarity , but rather its bipartition .",
    "therefore , let us consider @xmath75 nodes and 2 layers @xmath76 .",
    "the 4 components of the rank@xmath8 adjacency tensor @xmath29 are now defined as follows .",
    "@xmath77 encodes information about citing relations between papers , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 if paper @xmath34 cites paper @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath79 encodes information about paper authorship , _ i.e. _ @xmath80 if author @xmath35 is one of the authors of paper @xmath34 . finally , we define @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be zero tensors , consistently with the representation introduced in s.1 . for the sake of simplicity , since in the rest of the section we will be dealing only with rank-2 tensors , we will make use of the simpler classical matrix notation instead of the tensorial one . therefore we will denote @xmath77 as @xmath83 and @xmath79 as @xmath84 . in the author citation network proposed in @xcite ,",
    "each node represents an author , and @xmath85 if there exist at least one publication @xmath49 , of which @xmath34 is an author , that cites a publication @xmath86 of which @xmath35 is an author .",
    "each such publication gives a contribution @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the number of authors of publication @xmath49 , and @xmath90 is the number of authors of @xmath86 ) so that the total contribution of each citation is equal to 1 .",
    "let us consider an adjacency matrix @xmath91 of size @xmath92 , encoding the citation links between papers .",
    "@xmath83 can be built from @xmath91 by means of multiplication with a rectangular matrix @xmath93 of size @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and all the other elements are equal to 0 .",
    "then @xmath97 using @xmath93 we can also build @xmath84 from the projection matrix @xmath98 , of size @xmath99 , where @xmath100 if @xmath35 is one of the authors of paper @xmath34 : @xmath101 let us define @xmath102 as the normalised version of @xmath98 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is the number of authors of paper @xmath34 ) , then the @xmath105 adjacency matrix representing the network of citations between authors can be obtained performing two successive matrix multiplications : @xmath106 _ proof : _ @xmath107",
    "this means that @xmath108 is a sum over the papers authored by @xmath34 that cite paper @xmath109 , where each paper @xmath0 gives a contribution of 1 over the number of authors .",
    "then : @xmath110 each element @xmath111 is therefore a sum over all the pairs of papers @xmath112 such that @xmath34 is an author of @xmath0 and @xmath35 of @xmath109 , and each element of the sum gives a contribution equal to @xmath113 , as indeed defined in @xcite .",
    "@xmath114    we have demonstrated that the adjacency matrix of the author citation network is obtained performing two operations of matrix multiplication involving @xmath91 and @xmath98 .",
    "matrix multiplications consists in multiplications and summations of the matrix elements , which inevitably lead to information loss .",
    "the supra - adjacency matrix of the network proposed in this paper is instead the sum of the two expansions of @xmath91 and @xmath98 , _ i.e. _ @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "this guarantees that no information is loss , and this why we chose to consider the whole bipartite structure .",
    "figure [ toy - model-1 ] shows an example in which the information loss characteristic of the author citation network leads to a less fair ranking of authors compared to the ranking based on the network introduced in this paper . using our approach ( top figure )",
    ", the most central author is @xmath115 , who is the author of both the most central paper and of one of the second most central papers .",
    "however , in the author citation network framework , the most central author is @xmath84 ( to understand why , we recall that the pagerank centrality is based not only on the number of incoming edges , but on the importance of the nodes from which these edges originate ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the author citation network all the information about an author s incoming citations from different papers is aggregated , and therefore @xmath84 benefits from the importance of @xmath115 without any distinction between the importance coming from papers that actually cite @xmath84 , and that coming from @xmath115 s other papers . in this case @xmath115",
    "s most central ( and cited ) paper is not the one citing @xmath84 s paper , but this information is lost in the author citation network . as a consequence , the resulting ranking does not always reflect the real importance of the different authors .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the pagerank method to get the centrality of papers in @xmath91 , and then compute the author centrality as a properly normalised sum of the centralities of the papers she / he has authored . in matrix terms , the author pagerank centrality vector @xmath116 can be obtained by simply applying a linear transformation to the paper pagerank centrality vector @xmath117 : @xmath118 however , this solution involves another kind of aggregation which can lead to misleading results too .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ toy - model-2 ] . using the sum approach ,",
    "author @xmath119 becomes more central than author @xmath84 , because she / he authored two papers , even though they are the two most marginal papers in the network ( note that the only citation to paper 4 is a self - citation ) . on the contrary , @xmath84 is the author of a very central paper , and in fact our approach correctly classifies her / him as more central than @xmath119 .",
    "the issue with this alternative approach is that the pagerank is a diffusion process , which is not a linear dynamics .",
    "therefore summing over the centralities of different nodes is also an aggregation process through which some information on the system is lost .",
    "in figure  3 of the main text , we show that we find a strong positive correlation between the gain in rank that scholars and inventors obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and their topical interdisciplinarity ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
