    "yields from stellar simulations depend on the initial isotopic composition of the star .",
    "for example , the initial composition is important during hydrostatic burning phases for neutron capture reactions on initial metals , affecting odd - z nuclei abundances . in massive stars",
    "s_-process yields are constrained by both the initial cno abundance , which is responsible for providing a neutron source , and also the initial fe abundance which supplies the seeds for neutron capture @xcite .",
    "the initial fe abundance is also important in intermediate and low - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars for seeding the main _",
    "s_-process yields @xcite .",
    "the detailed stellar abundances affect the opacity of the star ( e.g. , the @xcite ) , which in turn will affect the structure as well as mass and angular momentum loss , which in turn changes the late stellar evolution . knowing the initial abundances of heavy isotopes is crucial for understanding @xmath2-process abundances , which use _ s_- and _ r_-process isotopes as seeds @xcite . since these _",
    "p_-isotopes are so rare , any difference in the seed abundances propagates to the resulting @xmath2-process yields .",
    "finally , some fraction of the initial stellar composition is not processed and will return to the interstellar medium ( ism ) unchanged , hence the final abundance pattern will directly inherit any poorly estimated initial abundances , but in many cases what is made in the stars and what was there initially is difficult to disentangle .    the purpose of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) is to understand how the abundances of the elements and their isotopes evolved from the big bang to today , and can be used for obtaining the isotopic abundances at any metallicity to use as stellar simulation inputs .",
    "traditional gce models typically split a model galaxy into one or more zones that require functional forms for infall and star formation rates @xcite .",
    "other processes such as interstellar medium ( ism ) mixing , and galaxy mergers are often not addressed , although there have been fairly recent efforts to incorporate mergers in a hierarchical model @xcite .",
    "the model galaxy is then usually evolved by integrating stellar yields over time , hence these models require nucleosynthesis yields from stellar simulations as inputs .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is that in order to provide self - consistent nucleosynthesis yields , the stellar simulations need a complete initial set of isotopic abundances .",
    "ideally , such a set would come directly from the gce simulation .",
    "this would require knowledge of the complete set of stellar yields for the specific abundances of the gce model at each time step and for each zone : the complicating factor is in reality composition is _ not _ just a function of metallicity , but also a function of environment , i.e. , time and space .",
    "instead the inputs for the stellar simulations often use scaled solar abundances or the results of some other approximation .",
    "furthermore most gce models usually evolve only a subset of the stable isotopes , such as just the iron peak isotopes @xcite or everything from hydrogen up to the iron peak @xcite , or only elements .",
    "an approach different than gce modeling to describe chemical abundances has been done recently by @xcite .",
    "they perform a principle component analysis on elemental data that takes correlations among elemental ratios and roughly delineates different processes responsible for these correlations , as well as identify likely sites and metallicity regimes congruent with them .",
    "these efforts offer verification of the established paradigm concerning many astrophysical processes , and may help constrain others whose properties remain incompletely known .",
    "the approach taken here is complementary to traditional gce methods , however , one must take care not to confuse our model with a proper gce model .",
    "we construct an astrophysical model of all stable isotopes , based on physical principles for the production sites and mechanisms .",
    "effectively , we scale isotopic abundances as a function of a chosen model parameter .",
    "this isotopic model is then mapped to an elemental model by summing the isotopic abundances to their respective elements .",
    "we then fit the elemental abundances against available observational data to obtain numerical values for the free parameters of the model .",
    "our completed model then gives the average _ isotopic _ history of the galaxy , subject to the approximations employed .",
    "the benefit of this approach to isotopic gce is that it is not necessary to know or model dynamic and galactic evolution processes employed in traditional gce models such as infall , ism mixing , and galaxy mergers , whose uncertainties are poorly constrained .    compared to full gce calculations our approach is rather simplistic and approximate , precisely because we do not integrate stellar yields or address dynamic and galactic evolution processes employed in traditional gce models , and we assume a unique and _ typical _ abundance distribution for a given metallicity rather than allowing for a spread in distribution as found in nature .",
    "the intention here is to improve upon the typical standard of scaling isotopic solar abundances by a constant factor , which effectively treats all isotopic production as primary .",
    "our improvements to this standard is to incorporate secondary processes and type ia contributions with separate scalings , to better approximate their relative values at desired input metallicities for nucleosynthesis studies , and the resulting isotopic histories from our model can be used as inputs in stellar models , and comparison to abundances from other sources like damped lyman-@xmath3 systems and dwarf galaxies .",
    "this represents an improvement over the previous standard of guessing _",
    "assumptions for the interpolation between the known endpoints of solar and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , or the use of scaled solar abundances .",
    "this model could also be seen as a first iteration step for more sophisticated first principle gce models , but at a higher order approximation than just scaled solar abundances , but not a replacement for them .",
    "hence , whereas the approximations and comparisons of our model are sufficient for this purpose , they would be quite unsatisfactory for describing gce itself .",
    "this paper has the following outline : section[sec : astrophysical - processes - and ] introduces the astrophysical processes and sites considered by the model , and the separation of the solar isotopic abundance pattern into contributions from these processes is discussed . in section[sec : model - description ] , the model itself is introduced and the scaling of the processes as a function of our parametrization is explained , using their relative solar contributions and the bbn abundance pattern as fixed boundary conditions .",
    "this also defines the relevant free parameters for fitting the elemental abundances with stellar data . in section[sec : fitting - scaling - model ] , the elemental model is fit to available data and best fit parameter values are found . in section[sec : results - and - discussion ] , the resulting elemental model is discussed and additional results given by the model .",
    "the final section[sec : conclusions ] addresses constraints of the model and discusses possible extensions for future work .",
    "our model attempts to cover the essential key astrophysical processes responsible for the production of the isotopes in the galaxy .",
    "we first use these processes to decompose the solar system abundances . here",
    "the isotopic solar abundance pattern was taken from a new data set by lodders et al .",
    "@xcite which gives updated values relative to their 2003 publication @xcite . in the following we organize the processes roughly by the mass range of isotopes to which they contribute .      when the universe was less than @xmath4100 seconds old , protons and neutrons were in thermal equilibrium with each other by weak interactions with neutrinos .",
    "upon continuing expansion , however , the temperature dropped sufficiently to `` freeze out '' neutrino interactions . at this `` freeze - out '' temperature , corresponding to @xmath5@xmath40.8mev , the weak interaction rate became slower than the hubble expansion , and the neutron - to - proton ratio ( after some subsequent @xmath6 decay ) was fixed to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "at this point bbn began with deuterium formation , and proceeded to produce non - negligible abundances of @xmath8h,@xmath9he , @xmath10he , @xmath11li , and minute abundances of @xmath12li and isotopes up through oxygen .",
    "we use the theoretical bbn abundance pattern from @xcite and provided by @xcite .",

    "the remaining negligible contributions of @xmath18li and the isotopes heavier than @xmath17li are not used .",
    "a constant @xmath17li abundance at low metallicities has been observed that suggested a primordial abundance , but whose value was much smaller than the predicted bbn abundance @xcite .",
    "this `` spite plateau '' remains unexplained , and for the present model we use the theoretical bbn abundance for @xmath17li .",
    "the remaining helium not made during bbn is a product of hydrogen burning and is scaled as a primary process .",
    "the `` release time scale '' of helium can vary depending on the stellar mass , and relative to metallicity it may scale slightly slower than a true primary process ( the same is true for c and n ) . we do not account for this delay in the present model .",
    "the `` light '' @xmath19-process involves interactions among neutrinos and lighter nuclei in ccsne environments @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos elevate nuclei to excited states , which then decay by nucleon emission @xcite .",

    "r_-process metals to serve as the target nuclei , the `` heavy '' @xmath19-process behaves like the @xmath2-process with respect to metallicity , discussed below in section[sub : p - isotopes ] .",

    "if these gcrs then hit ism protons or @xmath3-particles , this would satisfy the condition of a primary event .",

    "there are three constraints for choosing a parametrization for type ia isotopes as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "first , type ia contributions experience a delay before they begin to enrich the ism .",
    "this is due to the time necessary for , in the accreting white dwarf model , an intermediate to low mass star to evolve through its main sequences and then accrete sufficient material to surpass the chandrasekhar mass limit . in the meanwhile",
    ", massive stars continue to enrich the ism , making the galaxy more metal rich .",
    "the metallicity at which type ia are able to begin contributing to ism enrichment is typically constrained to the interval @xmath149<-1}$ ] depending on environment , galaxy size , etc . , but is usually favored towards the upper bound . hence , type ia contributions should be negligible below some value of @xmath134 .",
    "second , upon crossing the type ia onset value , contributions should gradually rise to their solar values .",
    "third , at high @xmath134 the scalings should behave essentially like a primary process .",
    "note that this last constraint is an assumption of our model and could be true only for a flat star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "in fact investigation into type ia progenitors by @xcite predicts that the ratio of ccsne to type ia rates to be increasing with redshift , a conclusion reached by posing a two component delay time distribution ( dtd ) progenitor model . if indeed there exists a type ia progenitor that operates at low redshifts and experiences a longer delay between the formation of the wd and the later type ia explosion ( named tardy by @xcite ) , a larger number of ccsne relative to number of ccsne at the birth of the wd contaminate the ism , thus increasing the metallicity at a faster rate than it was increasing at the birth of the wd .",
    "hence once the type ia sne do explode , their products would have a metallicity dependence different than linear , due to this increasing rate ratio of ccsne / sne type ia .",
    "we are careful to note that it is unclear exactly how a non flat sfr would impact our scaling for type ia sne , since the above discussion relies on time , and a relation between our model parameter and time can not be formed .",
    "we simply note that there may indeed be an effect .",
    "the analogy presented above with respect to flat sfrs serves to construct a rough behavior of type ia abundances , and does not mean to attach the physical quantity of time to our model parameter .",
    "furthermore , type ia onset may not occur at one unique metallicity , there may be a spread - in how far the different environments have evolved in terms of z ( and o as its main tracer ) - when type ia sets in .",
    "hence , the corresponding parameter value @xmath134 for ia onset is not unique for all constituents , but rather just a typical average that fits the different environments that we sample as as function of it .",
    "one specific form which satisfies all three constraints discussed is given , e.g. , by a scaled and shifted hyperbolic tangent base function ,    @xmath150/[\\tanh(\\mathit{a - b})+\\tanh(\\mathit{b})]}.\\ ] ]    the specific value for type ia onset is determined by fitting the free parameters , _",

    "the motivation for choosing a power law dependence on these parameters lies in the relations between abundance and metallicity for primary and secondary events , namely that primary events produce abundances linear in metallicity , and secondary produce abundances quadratic in metallicity .",
    "the chosen model parameter @xmath166 takes the place of total metallicity ( as discussed in the beginning of this section ) , and the exponents are parametrized for fitting with data . the metallicity dependence for the @xmath2-process is less clear .",

    "it is clear that [ pb / fe ] should indeed drop , as agb stars do not produce isotopes at arbitrary low metallicities , but the exact nature of the drop to the _ r_-process may not be well represented by our model .",

    "the functional forms for all scalings are now fixed by adjusting model to optimally fitting the observational data .",
    "a comparison is given in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "since each isotopic contribution in the `` massive '' category is independently interpolated between solar and [ fe / h ] , the `` massive '' ( brown thin solid line ) scaling shown in fig.[fig8 ] is an example , and what is shown is the scaling for the massive contribution to @xmath135 only .",
    "hence , this scaling gives @xmath229=log\\left(^{56}fe_{massive}/{}^{56}fe_{massive,\\odot}\\right)-log\\left(o / o_{\\odot}\\right)}$ ] , where @xmath230 is the massive contribution to the solar abundance of @xmath135 .",

    "it is concerning that the type ia scaling begins to flatten at low metallicities until its slope becomes less than the @xmath2-process ( green dot - dot - dot - dashed line ) .",
    "whereas contributions are negligible at these metallicities , the @xmath157 function chosen for type ia fails to describe the accurate physical picture , as the slope ideally should increase sharply below onset to reflect type ia `` turning on . ''",
    "we accept this behavior for the type ia scaling in part because contributions are already negligible and would offer insignificant corrections to the isotopic abundances if changed .",
    "even though our type ia scaling has a negligible impact on the abundances below the onset value , its description in this range is not constrained at low metallicities . in the present model",
    "it is only important for * @xmath121>-1.1}$ ] . *",
    "furthermore , the elemental data ends at @xmath121\\approx-4}$ ] , and hence the only constraint on type ia scaling below this metallicity ( where it flattens out ) is that there is no contribution from the bbn composition .",
    "both the massive star ( brown solid line ) and _ r_-process ( black thick dotted line ) scalings show similar trends at all metallicities , due to their shared primary nature .",
    "abundances for the @xmath2-process and @xmath98-process are scaled the same as the heavy _",
    "s_-process and _ r_-process , respectively .    both components of the _",
    "s_-process do not show the typical behavior of secondaries .",
    "the heavy component ( red dot - dashed line ) shows a higher drop off at lower metallicities than the primary processes , but with a slower exponent of 1.509 compared to the theoretical value of 2 .",
    "the light _",
    "s_-process ( blue dotted line ) and weak _",
    "s_-process ( thick pink dashed line ) scalings behave similarly at all metallicities , with an exponent intermediate between the heavy _ s_-process and primary processes .",

    "the failure of our model to reproduce the theoretical secondary nature is not new , and this discrepancy has been previously observed in the data @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to alleviate this discrepancy by noting that at low metallicities rotating massive stars may have an increased neutron exposure in two different ways .",
    "the first is enhanced nitrogen production from cno burning , which then burns into neon to seed the neutron source @xcite .",
    "the second is an earlier @xmath232ne ignition due to higher core temperatures @xcite .",
    "the effect of this larger neutron exposure is enhanced weak _",
    "s_-process production at low metallicities , driving an increase in the abundance and resulting in a parameter value that is closer to a primary rather than secondary process .    explaining",
    "the discrepancy for the heavy and light components is more challenging .",
    "it may be plausible , however , that we are observing the net result of a mixed isotopic history .",
    "that is , one could imagine a composition with a given abundance of an isotope made from a primary process in some astrophysical environment , that is then processed in a different astrophysical environment at a later time .",
    "if another abundance of this isotope is then made from a secondary process in the new astrophysical environment , its history would change from primary to secondary .",
    "our model offers no way to track this effect .",
    "indeed the aggregate of these effects may be in fact what we observe , and hence may be why our model gives an averaged main component parameter that deviates from the theoretical value of 2.0 .",
    "of course , this only applies to elements whose isotopic contributions can be made from both primary and secondary sources . in section[sub : free - parameter - values ] we summarize our optimized parameter values .",
    "the complete scaling model for all elements is shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "the traditional method of scaling solar abundances for inputs into stellar simulations is equivalent to treating the galaxy as though all isotopic production is primary .",
    "a plot representing this approximation would be similar to fig.[fig9 ] , but with all metals changing their relative abundances at the same [ fe / h ] , which would look like a type of `` flag '' pattern , with all colors ( representing relative abundances ) changing together .",
    "in contrast to this approximation , fig.[fig9 ] shows the corrections offered by our model to the traditional approximation due to the inclusion of type ia onset and secondary processes .",
    "these corrections are identifiable as `` fingers '' which protrude in the horizontal axis , distorting the otherwise clean `` flag '' pattern , and occurring at elements that either lie on the fe - peak or that have strong secondary or other type ia contributions .",
    "the scalings that notably stand apart from the others are the light elements : h , he , and li .",
    "these begin with a much higher relative abundance ( compared to the metals ) due to bbn , and so change less , relative to their solar values compared to the other elements that begin with zero bbn contributions .",
    "additionally , pb displays a relative higher abundance at low metallicities due to the `` strong '' _ s_-process .",
    "the sharp drop of pb at @xmath121\\approx-3.8}$ ] is consistent with fig.[fig7 ] , and is a very approximate treatment .    in section[sub : comparison - to - linear ] , we give the ratios of the isotopic abundances from our scaling model over the abundances generated from a linear interpolation between bbn and solar .",
    "the ratios are computed for two sub - solar metallicities ( @xmath147=-1 $ ] and @xmath147=-3 $ ] ) , and illustrate the corrections the model provides to the standard approach .    finally , our choice for the model parameter _",
    "@xmath134 _ can now be compared to the normalized metallicity z / z@xmath130 .",
    "the plot is given in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig10 ] , our choice for the model parameter indeed corresponds to z / z@xmath130 to within 2% for all values .",
    "the deviation from true linear occurs close to solar metallicity , when type ia sne contributions become important and produce a small , almost unidentifiable `` bump '' near @xmath233\\thickapprox-0.2}$ ] .",
    "this comparison verifies our motivation for choosing functions for primary and secondary processes as being proportional to a polynomial of @xmath134 .",
    "a metallicity - dependent galactic isotopic decomposition for all stable isotopes has been constructed .",
    "the solar abundance pattern was decomposed into several astrophysical processes responsible for isotope synthesis .",
    "parametric functions were chosen to scale the contributions from each astrophysical process to give isotopic abundances , with the solar abundance pattern and bbn used as boundary conditions .",
    "the isotopic scalings were summed into elemental scalings and compared with stellar data in the halo and disk to tune the fit parameters of the model .",
    "the final scalings provide a complete isotopic abundance pattern at any desired metallicity .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide _ isotopic _ abundances that can be used as initial abundances for stellar models in future work , or other nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "our model is a large improvement over approximating the input _ isotopic _ abundance pattern by simply scaling the solar abundances , and/or using solar isotopic ratios .",
    "this is the first time this has been done in a systematic way .",
    "the interpretation of our offered solar abundance pattern decomposition is approximate , as different assumptions ( of varying reliability ) operate for different isotopes .",
    "the decompositions of the light isotopes ( below carbon ) likely reflect the best current understanding , however , the current understanding is admittedly an area of ongoing investigation .",
    "the decomposition from carbon up to the fe peak from massive stars and type ia sne are the result of scalings done on data from two models that preserve the isotopic ratios across the two models , which distorts the original abundance patterns taken from the simulations .",
    "whereas this preserves the salient features of these two processes , it should be noted that the isotopes that are not cno or fe peak suffer a larger uncertainty in their decompositions due to this scaling .",
    "furthermore we make no distinction between the several operative primary processes that fall under the category of `` massive stars , '' which are dominated by ccsne yields but also necessarily include yields from stellar winds of lower mass stars , @xmath19-process , and classical novae .",
    "s_-process yields used show good agreement with the solar abundances , however , the weak _ s_-process computation only reproduces the necessary abundances for three of the six _ s_-only isotopes along the weak _ s_-process path .",
    "the method for computing the weak _",
    "s_-process should ideally rely upon stellar models , unfortunately the results often display over - productions of several isotopes above their solar values .",
    "our more simple approach , whereas less robust , has the advantage of only two isotopic over - productions , and is calculated directly from the neutron capture cross - sections and branching ratios .",
    "in addition to providing isotopic abundances for input into stellar simulations , our methodology can also be applied to model other systems such as dwarf galaxies , and tailoring the free parameters to relevant data sets will then yield approximate chemical abundances for such systems .",
    "yet another application lies with stellar model fits .",
    "currently published stellar evolution models only give average yields for stars over certain mass ranges .",
    "these averages must be fitted to available observational data sets , as done for example by @xcite .",
    "the need for this fit is evident , since stellar models only address the stellar nucleosynthesis part of gce and neglect several processes which will ultimately influence the subsequent ism abundances over many stellar lifetimes , processes such as infall and ism mixing .",
    "the age of the galaxy ( or timescale of gce ) is much greater than the typical stellar lifetimes that contribute significantly to ism enrichment ; hence this fitting is required to give stellar yields a more precise physical meaning in a gce context .",
    "thus in addition to providing the initial isotopic abundances for input into stellar simulations , the abundances can also be used to fit the resulting stellar yields from the model in a consistent fashion .",
    "this work has laid out a basic method of isotopic decomposition as a function of metallicity based on elemental observational data and underlying nucleosynthesis processes for a complicated environment like the galaxy .",
    "future work should have a more detailed look at specific and less complicated environments like , e.g. , dwarf galaxies that have different contributions and would hence allow one to constrain model parameters more uniquely ( such as type ia onset contributions ) .",
    "another challenge will be to relate and identify the different nucleosynthesis processes with the principle components found in observational work like that of @xcite , and help to improve such principle component analysis based on physical nucleosynthesis processes .",
