    "superconductivity is by virtue a mesoscopic phenomenon since the typical length scales involved exceed by far fermi wavelenght and , frequently , the mean free path.@xcite the adequate semiclassical theory of non - equlibrium superconductivity has been initially elaborated for bulk systems .",
    "@xcite subsequent contributions @xcite that treated supeconducting constrictions and interfaces have provided the extension of the theory to heterogenious structures and the systems made artificially . thereby the theoretical development has been essentially accomplished . the concise account for this work one can find in @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this patch of theoretical development as to `` full theory '' .",
    "there used to be a sharp contrast between the complexity of the full theory and relative simplicity of the final answers .",
    "it is a kind of disappointment to address , for instance , the problem of linear conductivity of a double tunnel barrier that separates a normal metal and a superconductor , to spend weeks and weeks calculating and to obtain that under very general assumptions @xmath0 , @xmath1 being conductivity in the normal state .",
    "the so - called `` circuit theory of andreev reflection '' was born in an attempt to enhance the applicability of the full theory .",
    "initially it was a purely pedagogical project .",
    "i wanted to derive a primitive model that illustrates the essential features of the full theory .",
    "to my surprise , the model worked in a very efficient way .",
    "so i could not resist temptation and published a scientific article.@xcite    since then , the circuit theory has been reviewed @xcite and improved . c. w. j. beenakker , d. esteve , m. devoret , n. argaman @xcite reported extensions and reformulations , published as well as unpublished .",
    "very elaborated formulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the author has extended the circuit theory to cover ballistic point contacts that enabled me to make calculations reported in @xcite .    in the present work we present a novel formulation of the circuit theory that incorporates most of the changes proposed .",
    "this theory enables energy- and voltage - dependent transport calculations in superconducting and normal structures .",
    "an important extension reported here is the concept of an `` arbitrary connector '' .",
    "this allows for unified treatment of superconducting junctions of arbitrary nature .",
    "this extension is also relevant for the full theory .",
    "in fact , the resulting circuit theory looks very much like as a discrete version of the full theory . so that the full power of the full theory can now be incorporated in a circuit calculation . from the other hand ,",
    "even a very sophisticated experimental layout can be presented with a few circuit theory elements .",
    "this essentially simplifies any practical calculation , numerical as well as analytical one .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ old ] we remind the reader the approach of the old circuit theory and its limitations .",
    "we formulate the requirements to a circuit theory that is to overcome these limits . in section [ disc ]",
    "we provide a discrete version of the full theory equations in the diffusive limit .",
    "we introduce an important concept of the `` leakage current '' to describe decoherence between electrons and holes .",
    "we extend the concepts of a node and a connector in the next section .",
    "section [ next ] is devoted to the arbitrary connector .",
    "we show there how a connector with known transmission eigenvalues shall be incorporated into the circuit theory . in section",
    "[ rules ] we accomplish the formulation by giving the set of the rules of the new circuit theory and provide a simple example in section [ exem ] .",
    "section [ numeric ] is devoted to the numerical algorithm that seem to suit most the structure of the theory .",
    "we discuss its practical implementations .",
    "physics of electric conduction in a system that consists of superconductors and normal metals , with optional tunnel junctions , can be adequately treated with non - equilibrium superconductivity equations . those are written for keldysh green s functions .",
    "@xcite those are @xmath2 nambu - keldysh matrices matrices depending in a stationary case on space coordinates and energy .",
    "they can be subdivided onto @xmath3 nambu matrices made up from usual and anomalous green functions ( we use check for @xmath2 and hat for @xmath3 matrices ) : @xmath4 and similar for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "semiclassical and diffusive appoximations allow to obtain equations for green functions in coinciding points .",
    "we define @xmath7 , @xmath8 here advanced and retarded functions determine the characteristics of energy spectrum of the system in a given point whereas @xmath9 sets particle distribution over these energy states and thus directly related to the electric current and other physical quantities .",
    "it is assumed that the size of the system at least in a transport direction greatly exceeds fermi wavelength and elastic mean free path , this makes diffusive approximation sensible . in this approximation ,",
    "non - equilibrium superconductivity equations resemble a standard diffusion equation and read @xcite @xmath10 = 0 ; \\\\",

    "a pseudounitary condition holds for the matrices @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce here a density of a matrix current defined by @xmath15 @xmath16 being specific conductivity in the normal state , so that the equation [ general ] can be presented as a conservation law for this current @xmath17=0 ; \\label{conservation}\\ ] ]    the matrix current density ( [ current ] ) can be related to the electric current density by means of @xmath18 \\label{elcurrent}\\ ] ]    if there are tunnel interfaces in the structure , @xmath19 are in general different on both sides of the interface .",

    "these equations shall be also fulfilled by the boundary conditions `` at infinity '' , otherwise their solution is not unique .",
    "since we are talking about the transport , there must be at least two `` infinities '' that correspond to source and drain .",
    "in general , the structure can be connected to many bulk electrodes , either normal or superconducting , so it can have many `` infinities '' .",
    "such bulk electrode we will call `` terminal '' . in each terminal @xmath19 shall assume its equilibrium value corresponding to the voltage at which the terminal is biased .",
    "with all these additions , eq .",
    "[ general ] provides a solid framework to calculate electric properties of superconducting structures .",
    "the circuit theory of andreev conductance @xcite has grown from the fact that , under certain conditions , it is plausible to omit the second term in eq .",
    "[ conservation ] . so that the matrix current is conserved exactly .",
    "now we spell limitations under which it is a true thing to do so .",
    "the first term is of the order of @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the system size , or more precisely , the size at which the resistance of the structure is being formed . in the normal metal @xmath27 and",
    "the right term is of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "thus we need a sufficiently small system : @xmath29 .",
    "it implies that : a ) the temperature is low enough : @xmath30 .",
    "b ) the voltage is low enough : @xmath31 .",
    "the last limitation below is given by the fact that we use stationary equation .",
    "if there had been several superconducting terminals in the structure biased by different voltages , it would have given rise to non - stationary josephson - like effect that would make the green functions to depend on two energies .",
    "so that , c ) all sureconducting terminals are at the same voltage .",
    "let us set this voltage to zero .",
    "the key idea of any circuit theory is to get from continuous conservation law of the type ( [ conservation ] ) to its discrete version .",
    "the structure is presented as a set of _ nodes _ those are connected pairwise by means of _ connectors_. the conservation law is presented as a set of second kirchhoff rules for each node expect terminal ones , @xmath32 where the summation goes over all the nodes @xmath33 connected to the node @xmath34 .",
    "the current @xmath35 depends on the states of the nodes @xmath36 and on the connector .",
    "therefore , the eqs .",
    "[ krules ] determine the state of the nodes at a given state of the terminals . in a normal terminal biased at voltage @xmath37 @xmath19 is given by @xmath38 in a superconducting terminal , @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in a common electric circuit theory the state of the node is characterized by its electrostatic potential .",
    "the current is a scalar given by @xmath41 . in the circuit theory @xcite the state of the node is in principle characterized by the full @xmath13 and the current retains matrix structure .",
    "however the symmetries of @xmath19 specific for @xmath42 allow for significant simplifications .",
    "energy dependence of @xmath43 can be disregarded and @xmath9 can be integrated over the energy .",
    "the kirchhoff equations can be separated on two parts .",
    "first part are equations for vector `` spectral currents '' to determine `` spectral vectors '' @xmath43 in each node .",
    "second part are equations for usual currents to determine non - equilibrium chemical potentials in each node and , finally , andreev conductance .",
    "the resistance of the tunnel connectors is remormalized , this renormalization is given by scalar product of two `` spectral vectors '' on the sides of the connector .",
    "the old circuit theory is good to obtain simple answers .",
    "if the analysis of experimental data in real structures is meant , the conditions a ) and b ) appear to be very restrictive .",
    "beside the fact that the temperature can not be made arbitrary low , the voltage and temperature dependence of the transport can not be accessed in the framework of the theory .",
    "we will not explain here the rules and details of the old circuit theory : those can be found in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to formulate a circuit theory that is free form @xmath42 limitation .",
    "we can now spell the requirements to the structure of this theory .",
    "first , in order to comply with the full theory , the state of the node shall be characterized by a full @xmath19 matrix .",
    "second , since energy dependence of the green functions has to be taken into account , the equations ( [ krules ] ) shall be written and solved separately in each energy slice . by doing",
    "so we disregard possible inelastic scattering , which is usually not important .",
    "physical values like electric current are then obtained by integration over @xmath44 .",
    "the third requirement stems from the recent technological achievements .",
    "it is possible now to incorporate ( ballistic ) point contacts into mesoscopic superconducting structures .",
    "so we require that the theory shall describe such contacts and , in general , any arbitrary constrictions and connections .",
    "below we derive the rules of this theory and discuss their implementations .",
    "let us begin with formulation of the discrete version of eq .",
    "[ general ] . instead of",
    "continuous space @xmath45 we take a connected discrete set of @xmath46 such that @xmath47 in neighboring points of the set are close to each other .",
    "we associate a resistor with each connection in the set in such a way that it simulates continuous resistivity of the system .",
    "let us show how to choose such resistors for square lattice of @xmath46 with periods @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) that approximates homogeneous film with sheet conductivity @xmath16 .",
    "let us expand @xmath19 in the vicinity of the node @xmath34 : @xmath50 , @xmath51 . from eq .",
    "[ current ] we obtain the continuous matrix current density @xmath52 in the network , the current density is given by @xmath53 @xmath33 being nodes neighboring @xmath34 .",
    "we see that if we choose @xmath54 , \\label{tj}\\ ] ] @xmath55 we reproduce eq .",
    "[ continu ] . to prove this we make use of the fact that @xmath56_{+}=0 $ ] , the latter follows from @xmath57 .",
    "now we can rewrite eq . [ conservation ] as @xmath58 where we introduce `` leakage '' current @xmath59 , \\label{leakage}\\ ] ] @xmath60 being volume associated with the node @xmath34 .",
    "the term `` leakage '' comes from the fact that the eq . has a formal similarity with the equations of the electric circuit theory that take into account the charge leakage to the ground from each node .",
    "there is no net leakage of the electric current due to ( [ leakage ] ) since the corresponding term appears to be zero .",
    "however , the matrix current ( [ leakage ] ) describes two processes that may be viewed as a sort of leakage .",
    "namely , the terms proportional to @xmath44 describe decoherence between electrons and holes , that is , the fact that the electrons and holes at the same energy difference @xmath44 from fermi surface have slightly mismatching wavevectors .",
    "so we have `` leakage of coherence '' .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath11 are responsible for the conversion between quasiparticles and cooper pairs that form the superconducting condensate .",
    "this is a leakage of quasiparticles .",
    "we note that , by virtue of eq .",
    "[ boundary ] , the kirchhoff rules ( [ tj ] ) , ( [ with_leakage ] ) are also suitable for systems containing tunnel junctions .",
    "just some connections of the resistive network shall be replaced with ( specific ) conductances of the tunnel barriers .    with increasing fineness of the node set",
    "we obviously converge to continuous limit and obtain more and more accurate agreement with the results of the full theory .",
    "a practical question is how fine should this mesh be in a realistic calculation .",
    "a short answer is that the nodes shall be close than than the coherence length @xmath61 . in practice ,",
    "the mesh describing a diffusive wire should contain about a dozen nodes even at @xmath62 that exceeds the system size .",
    "this drawback is compensated in the limit of short @xmath62 , since in this case the interesting behaviour occurs merely at the edge of the system and it makes no sense to keep fine mesh through the whole sample .",
    "it turns out that the mesh of @xmath63 nodes is sufficient to describe transport properties of the diffusive wire this the accuracy at least @xmath64 in the whole energy range .",
    "as we saw above , the essential requirements to a node are i. its state is characterized by @xmath19 , so that green functions must be isotropic on the scale on the node size , ii .",
    "the size of the node is less than coherence length .",
    "this allows us to treat as nodes parts of the system where the transport is not or is not entirely diffusive .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the well - known model of ballistic cavity.@xcite although the transport in the cavity is the ballistic one , one can actually regard the cavity as a node connected to reservoirs by means of ballistic point contacts .",
    "it is the chaotic character of ballistic transport that makes green function isotropic .",
    "the condition of good isotropization is fulfilled provided the diameter of the cavity greatly exceeds the typical size of the point contacts , or , in other terms , the conductance of the contacts must be much less than the sharvin estimation of the cavity conductance .",
    "the cavity must be smaller than the coherence length in the ballistic limit .",
    "the leakage current from the cavity is still given by eq .",
    "[ leakage ] : it does not know which mechanism has provided the isotropization of the green function , the cavity could be diffusive as well .",
    "this makes it relevant to investigate such connectors between the nodes as ballistic point contacts .",
    "previous experience with superconducting constrictions shows a significant difference between tunnel junctions , diffusive and ballistic constrictions .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that the constrictions of the same conductance have different distribution of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "this implies that the expression ( [ tj ] ) is not valid for the arbitrary connector .",
    "below we derive the expression for the matrix current in terms of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "the derivation presented below makes substantial use of the approach @xcite and the general scattering theory outlined in @xcite . the goal is to express the matrix current in the junction between two nodes in terms of isotropic green functions in these nodes and transmission eigenvalues that characterize the scattering in the junction .",
    "we subdivide the system onto five zones : two isotropization zones on both sides of the junction , two ballistic zones and scattering zone .",
    "we assume that the size of all zones in transport direction is much shorter than the coherence length . under this condition ,",
    "the matrix current conserves and can be easily evaluated in ballistic zone where green function equations are simple .",
    "the same condition allows us to disregard energy dependence of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "following to @xcite , we discretize the transverse motion of electrons . we introduce a number of transport channels labeled by @xmath65 and let @xmath66 to be along the transport direction .",
    "the scattering takes place near @xmath67 .",
    "let us first consider the left side of the junction , @xmath68 .",
    "similar to the approach of the ref .",
    "@xcite we present the exact green function @xmath69 in the following form @xmath70 @xmath71 being fermi momentum in the @xmath65-th channel .",
    "the functions @xmath72 are varying smoothly at the scale of @xmath73 and obey the following semiclassical equations : @xmath74 @xmath75 being the effective hamiltonian that comprises @xmath76 and the self energy part that describes isotropization scattering .",
    "these functions are discontinuous at @xmath77 , their values for @xmath78 and @xmath79 being matched with the aid of the following condition @xcite @xmath80    it is convenient to work with matrices defined in an extended basis with comprises nambu - keldysh indices , channels , and @xmath16= direction of the mode .",
    "we will use tilde accent for matrices in this basis , for example,@xmath81 .",
    "we will also denote with @xmath82 the matrices that are diagonal in mode indices and with @xmath83 those diagonal in nambu - keldysh indices . to characterize the green functions @xmath84",
    "we introduce the matrix @xmath85 such that @xmath86 the matrix @xmath85 is continuous at @xmath77 .",
    "the factors @xmath87 are chosen in such a way that @xmath85 is composed of the scattering wave functions that are normalized per unit flux .",
    "this makes it easy to apply the general scattering formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite . following @xcite",
    "we introduce a transfer matrix that relates wave functions on the right side ( @xmath88 ) and those on the left side ( @xmath89 ) of the scatterer , @xmath90 since @xmath85 transforms as a product of wave functions , its values at @xmath91 and @xmath92 are related by @xmath93 the transfer matrix @xmath94 obeys flux conservation , @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "it follows from ( [ conservation_p ] ) and ( [ scattering ] ) that the quantity we are after , the matrix current , can be expressed in terms of @xmath85 on either side : @xmath97 = \\frac{e^2}{\\pi } { \\rm tr}_{m,\\sigma } \\left [ \\bar \\sigma^z \\tilde g_2 \\right ] .",
    "\\label{current_p}\\ ] ] to find the matrix current , we have to evaluate @xmath98 . to do so",
    ", we shall consider the behavior of @xmath85 in the isotropization zone on both sides of the scatterer .",
    "let us first consider the left side of the scatterer and let us assume the simplest model of the isotropization : scattering on the point defects .",
    "then in the isotropization zone we may approximate @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath75 does not depend on @xmath66 the equations [ derivatives ] can be readily solved in the most general form and we can express @xmath100 in the isotropic zone in terms of its value @xmath101 in the ballistic zone , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is diagonal over channel index , @xmath104 to derive that we use that @xmath105 . to assure that @xmath84 does not grow with decreasing @xmath66 , we shall require @xmath106 @xmath107 similar consideration for the right side of the scatterer yields",
    "@xmath108 @xmath109    we see that the above conditions do not contain any information about how the isotropization actually occur .",
    "this suggests that those are of universal nature and do not depend on isotropization mechanism .",
    "conditions ( [ asympt_een])-([asympt_vier ] ) together with eq . [ scattering ] completely determine @xmath98 , green function in the ballistic region .",
    "to find an explicit expression , we multiply eq .",
