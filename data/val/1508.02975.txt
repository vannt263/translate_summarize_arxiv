    "furthermore , while the number of special parts of a dpp corresponds to the number of negative ones in the asm  @xcite , there is no such tsscpp statistic .",

    "so one might hope to begin a general bijection by determining the @xmath147st row of the monotone triangle from the bottom row of the tsscpp boolean triangle ) by left - justifying all the vertical steps and then bijecting in the same way as in the permutation case .",

    "so we obtain the following , as a corollary of theorems  [ thm : tamari ] and [ thm : catdistr ] .",
    "[ cor : tamcat2 ] @xmath21 contains both @xmath16 and @xmath18 as subposets .",
    "in particular , the subposet of @xmath21 consisting of the @xmath17-avoiding permutations is isomorphic to @xmath16 and the subposet consisting of the @xmath19-avoiding permutations is isomorphic to @xmath18 .    in theorems  [ thm : tamari ] and",
    "[ thm : catdistr ] , it was shown that the @xmath149 covering relations of lemma  [ lem : magogboolcovers ] on either the @xmath17- or @xmath19-avoiding subposets reduce to reverse componentwise comparison covering relations on the catalan sequence @xmath197 , where @xmath199 was defined to equal @xmath32 plus the sum of row @xmath200 in the boolean triangle .",
    "this is equivalent to reverse componentwise comparison of the @xmath17- or @xmath19-avoiding permutation tsscpp boolean triangles .",
    "thus the @xmath17-avoiding subposet of @xmath15 is equivalent to the @xmath17-avoiding subposet of @xmath21 , and likewise for the @xmath19-avoiding subposets .      in this section ,",
    "we have discussed three posets : @xmath148 on asm , and @xmath149 and @xmath20 on tsscpp . @xmath148 and @xmath149 are distributive lattices and members of the tetrahedral poset family  @xcite , while @xmath20 is not a lattice in general ( proposition  [ prop : notlattice ] ) . @xmath167 and @xmath21 are known permutation posets ; @xmath167 is the strong bruhat order  @xcite which is not a lattice , and we have shown @xmath21 is @xmath22\\times[3]\\times\\cdots\\times[n]$ ] , which is a distributive lattice that sits between the weak and strong bruhat orders ( corollary  [ cor : tbool ] ) . while @xmath15 is neither a well - studied permutation partial order nor a lattice ( proposition  [ prop : notlatticemagog ] ) , it has catalan subposets isomorphic to the tamari lattice ( theorem  [ thm : tamari ] ) and the catalan distributive lattice ( theorem  [ thm : catdistr ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath15 may be an interesting new perspective from which to study permutations as well .",
    "we have also shown in corollary  [ cor : tamcat2 ] that the same tamari and catalan distributive subposets exist in @xmath21 as in @xmath15 .",
    "an additional point of contrast is that @xmath167 , as the strong bruhat order , contains the catalan distributive lattice as an induced subposet , but not the tamari lattice .",
    "we hope that the study of these various asm and tsscpp partial orders will continue to provide insight on the combinatorics of these objects and the associated outstanding bijection problems .",
