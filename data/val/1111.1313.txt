    "the jamming transition has attracted many physicists since liu and nagel indicated its similarity to the glass transition @xcite . in naive sense ,",
    "the glass transition is characterized by a divergence of time scale on a temperature - density plane @xcite , while the jamming transition is an athermal transition on a density - load plane as the emergence of rigidity for materials such as granular materials , forms , and colloidal suspensions @xcite . for frictionless particles",
    ", it is known that the pressure , the elastic modulus , and the characteristic frequency for the soft mode continuously emerge above a jamming transition point , while the coordination number changes discontinuously at the point @xcite .",
    "the jamming transition was discussed mainly on the axis of the density without any load and temperature in some pioneer works @xcite .",
    "it is instructive , however , that critical properties have been clarified when we look at the behavior of the jamming on the density - load plane in the zero load limit .",
    "for instance , critical scaling laws for the rheological transition , similar to those in continuous phase transitions , have been observed for sheared frictionless systems @xcite , while the discontinuous transition and the hysteresis loop are observed in the pressure and the shear stress for sheared frictional granular materials @xcite .",
    "coming back to the original idea in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can also discuss the jamming transition on the density - temperature plane , i.e. without any load .",
    "this approach has an advantage to clarify the relationship between the glass transition  @xcite and the jamming transition  @xcite , because the glass transition is originally defined only on the temperature - density plane .",
    "so far the behavior on the density - temperature plane in the zero temperature limit has been studied by some researchers , but the situation is still confusing . indeed , some indicated that the critical fraction @xmath0 for the divergence of the relaxation time in the zero temperature limit is identical to the critical point @xmath1 for the jamming transition of the athermal materials @xcite , while the others suggested that two transition points are different @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that berthier and witten have numerically confirmed from their simulation for soft repulsive particles at low temperature that ( i ) the relaxation time around the glass transition point @xmath0 satisfies a scaling relation , and ( ii ) @xmath0 is lower than that for the jamming point @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is also noticed that the separation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is clearly demonstrated from a simulation for sheared soft spheres in the zero temperature and zero shear limits @xcite .",
    "recently , the critical behavior of repulsive particles on the density - temperature plane near the jamming transition at zero temperature and high density has been studied both numerically and theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the replica theory gives a prediction on both the critical fraction and the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the validity of their prediction for the critical behavior of the pressure , the energy , and the divergence of the first peak of the radial distribution function have numerically verified @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the critical exponents are unique because they might depend on the protocol to prepare the system as for the critical density of the jamming transition @xcite .    in this paper , to clarify critical behavior on the density - temperature plane in the vicinity of the jamming transition point , we numerically investigate the value of plateau ( vp ) of the mean square displacement ( msd ) of tracer particles and the pressure of soft repulsive particles after quench of temperature and demonstrate that the critical exponents for critical scaling laws does not depend on the protocol , while the protocol dependence exists in the critical fraction .",
    "we should note that the pressure for soft spheres @xcite and msd for hard spheres @xcite have been numerically measured in the previous papers , but this paper is the first report on the numerical study of msd for soft spheres .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",

    "[ critical : sec ] , we will present scaling laws for the plateau and the pressure , and theoretically determine the critical exponents . in sec . [",

    "we study a three dimensional system consists of @xmath2 soft spherical particles with mass @xmath3 enclosed in a periodic cube of linear size @xmath4 .",
    "note that the box size @xmath4 is fixed for the most cases , but is changed when we will determine the jamming point in sec .",
    "we prevent the system from crystallization by using a 50:50 binary mixture of spheres of diameter ratio @xmath5 which is numerically confirmed from the radial distribution function , where sharp peaks characterizing crystallization do not exist @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the critical behavior for jamming transition of granular particles is unchanged even for a mono - disperse system or a poly - disperse system with equal number of particles of diameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xcite .    for later convenience ,",
