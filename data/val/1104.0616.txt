    "the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by penzias and wilson @xcite is easily one of the pivotal moments in the history of cosmology and the development of the hot big - bang model .",
    "cobe further confirmed that the cmb power spectrum follows to a high accuracy @xmath0 a planck distribution in the frequency region of @xmath1=60600ghz , @xcite .",
    "recently , however , measurements of cmb line temperatures @xmath2 performed by the + arcade 2 instrument @xcite at very low - frequencies ( @xmath3 ) show a statistically significant ( @xmath4 ) unexplained power excess . combining the arcade 2 data with data from the relevant literature in the frequency region from 22 mhz to 10 ghz results in a background power law spectrum of the form @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6k , @xmath7ghz , @xmath8k , and a spectral index of @xmath9 .",
    "it is further argued in @xcite that this deviation from the perfect black - body relation @xmath10 is neither an artifact of galactic foreground subtraction , nor can it be attributed to distant point sources .",
    "remarkably , a thermodynamical field theory developed in @xcite could be able to explain the power excess in .",
    "namely , it is argued that the gauge group @xmath11 of the photon field in the standard model ( sm ) is not fundamental but merely emerges from a su(2 ) yang - mills theory in a specific thermodynamical phase : the _ deconfining phase_. this is called the @xmath12 hypothesis .",
    "the theory is determined by a single parameter , and can be fixed by specifying the _ critical temperature _ @xmath13 below which the thermal su(2 ) gas undergoes a _ phase transition _ to the _ preconfining phase_.    assuming the @xmath12 hypothesis , the excess power at low frequencies measured by the arcade2 radiometers can be explained as a result of evanescent photon fields thermalized near the critical temperature @xmath14 of the deconfining phase @xcite .    that such an explanation for the excess power of the cmb is possible based solely on gauge symmetry considerations and finite temperature effects motivates the search for further experimental evidence in favor of the @xmath12 hypothesis .",
    "the arcade2 observation serves to fix @xmath13 , which we use to predict further observable consequences that can then be tested by experiment .",
    "the purpose of this thesis is the investigation of possible realizations of such an experimental test .",
    "we discuss the characteristics of the thermal radiation spectrum at low temperature and frequency under the @xmath12 hypothesis .",
    "it will turn out that su(2 ) gauge dynamics manifests itself through the appearance of a temperature - dependent _ frequency cutoff _",
    "@xmath15 below which photon propagation is forbidden .",
    "the cutoff frequency @xmath16 thus defines a _ screening region_. at low frequencies and temperatures comparable to that of @xmath13 , this effect results in a _ black - body anomaly _ : the vanishing of the power output of a black - body cavity within the screening region .",
