    "the einstein model of the solid state has been known for many years as the first model able to describe qualitatively the low - temperature behaviour of the specific heat @xcite .",
    "this model often serves as an approximation for studies of optical phonons , or soft modes in some intermetallic compounds @xcite and , as well , is found suitable to describe thermal properties of some modern low - dimensional structures @xcite .",
    "it is also referred to as a prototype for which the more sophisticated debye model has been developed @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it has been shown that in many cases the einstein model provides better results than the debye model @xcite .",
    "it is known that in spite of its usefulness and simplicity , the pure einstein model lacks the ability to describe fully the thermodynamic properties of the solid state .",
    "for instance , neither the proper equation of state , nor the thermal expansion or compressibility can be obtained .",
    "thus , apart from the celebrated specific heat behaviour , which is an important consequence of the quantum nature of harmonic oscillators , other thermodynamic properties have not successfully been described within this model .",
    "+ there are numerous attempts in the literature aimed at improving the pure einstein model @xcite .",
    "for instance , a `` variational einstein model '' has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for describing low temperature solids from the feynman path integral perspective .",
    "the formalism has been applied to a specific system , consisting of solid hydrogen with lithium impurities . however ,",
    "one of the theoretical results of ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be controversial , namely the dependence of the free energy , which is presented there as an increasing function of temperature ( see fig.16 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , giving the indication that the corresponding entropy is negative . cankurtaran and askerov @xcite have introduced the so called einstein - debye model for which the calculations of the thermal expansion coefficient were possible by introducing the grneisen parameter . however , neither the gibbs free - energy , nor the compressibility could be calculated within that approach .",
    "thus , the complete thermodynamic description has not been achieved there . in ref .",
    "@xcite the `` nonlocal einstein crystal '' has been considered , for which the thermodynamic functions have been constructed .",
    "the considerations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite seem to be of pure theoretical character when the einstein crystal is replaced by a harmonic sublattice with a size that is coupled to the total volume .",
    "additionally , the mie - grneisen approach has been developed by holzapfel et al .",
    "for the description of simple metals @xcite as well as some simple solids , such as nacl and mgo @xcite .",
    "the optimized pseudo - debye - einstein model has been used there , and good agreement with the experimental data has been achieved . however , the method presented in refs .",
    "@xcite does not seem to be straightforward enough to use since it requires many fitting parameters to be introduced for calculations of the free - energy .",
    "+ on the other hand , there exists a rich literature on the description of solid state properties within the elastic models @xcite .",
    "these studies are supported by the experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "for instance , birch @xcite considers the single - crystal and polycrystalline nacl at high pressure using the finite strain ( eulerian ) theory . in this approach ,",
    "the equation of state contains coefficients which have to be fitted in each particular temperature . despite the usefulness of the model for studies of isothermal compression",
    ", it does not involve the thermal ( vibrational ) energy and therefore is not suitable for description of the specific heat .",
    "similarly , in the paper of vinet et al .",
    "@xcite the universal form of the equation of state has been found based on the scaling argumentation .",
    "the results obtained there have been discussed in the context of the birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite and show very good agrement with the experimental data . however ,",
    "the gibbs free - energy has not been derived in that works ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the full thermodynamic description of the system has not been constructed . as a matter of fact , the same deficiency can be risen for some other papers devoted to the application of the equation of state based on the elastic models .",
    "a comparative review of the experimental equations of state existing in the literature is given in refs .",
    "+ among other modern methods one should mention the first principles computations within the density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this includes , for instance , the equation of state , elastic constants and phonon dispersion relation calculations @xcite . on the other hand , by the first - principles molecular - dynamics simulation ( fpmd ) method the thermal expansivity and the specific heat",
    "have been calculated @xcite . a good agreement with the experimental data",
    "is often achieved .",
    "however , the analytic description remains always desirable from the point of view of understanding the physics behind the model .",
    "+ such a situation motivated us to combine the einstein and elastic models and to complete them in a way that enables to overcome the above - mentioned problems .",
    "looking in the literature , such idea can already be found in some papers @xcite , however , only particular thermodynamic characteristics have been studied there .",
    "thus , our aim is to construct the self - consistent and full thermodynamic description . in order to make it possible ,",
    "the following aspects should be taken into account : firstly , the common frequency of quantum oscillators should not be treated as a constant value but should be volume ( and , in consequence , temperature ) dependent .",
    "obviously , such idea is not new and for the first time emerged in the paper of grneisen @xcite , where a specific frequency / volume dependence has been assumed as a hypothesis .",
    "this assumption is supported by the argument that the wavelength of collective excitations ( phonons ) depends on the crystal size .",
    "secondly , the vibrational einstein hamiltonian necessarily needs to be completed by the static , elastic part @xcite .",
    "the elastic energy accounts for the mutual interactions of the atoms even if they are not in a thermal vibrating state @xcite .",
    "it is known that the static energy is responsible for crystal compressibility @xcite , and owing to its magnitude and nature , can not be inferred from the model of independent oscillators .",
    "it turns out that for the purpose of the combined model the elastic free - energy should also be modified by taking into account the linear term ( which is normally neglected in the elastic theory ) as well as the static entropy .",
    "the details of this modification will be explained in the next section .",
    "owing to analytical simplicity we will neglect the electronic excitation term .",
    "it is argued that this term is generally a small correction to the solid equation of state @xcite .",
    "+ taking this into account , we propose improving the model and constructing the gibbs energy of the system from the beginning .",
    "we assume that the balance between the internal and external pressures keeps the system in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "according to our knowledge , the detailed balance between the expanding pressure of quantum oscillators and the compressive elastic pressure has not been discussed in the literature .",
    "having obtained the expression for the gibbs energy , a full thermodynamic description of the crystal can be achieved .",
    "the main parameters of the theory , which can be extracted from experiment , are the einstein frequency in the ground state ( or the einstein temperature ) , the volume elastic modulus in the ground state - supplemented by the structural space - filling coefficient - and the grneisen parameter .",
    "we will show that these parameters , in principle , allow us to calculate other properties within a reasonable range of experimental values .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in the following , theoretical section , the outline of the model is given and the method of derivation the gibbs energy is presented . in particular , for the combined model the new equation of state is obtained .",
    "in the last section , some representative numerical results concerning the thermodynamic properties are illustrated in figures .",
    "these calculations are compared with the experimental data for solid argon . a critical discussion of the presented approach",
    "is also included .",
    "the hamiltonian is assumed in the form of : @xmath0 where the elastic , volume dependent part , @xmath1 , can be written as : @xmath2 whereas the oscillatory part , @xmath3 , is given in the form : @xmath4 in ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath5 is the number of atoms which are treated as the three - dimensional oscillators , and @xmath6 is the excitation number operator connected with the @xmath7-th oscillator .",
    "the form of the elastic hamiltonian ( [ eq2 ] ) assumed in this paper is different ( much simpler ) from that presented in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "the elastic hamiltonian , @xmath1 , consists of several terms .",
    "the most important is the harmonic term @xmath8 , where @xmath9-constant is the volume elastic modulus in the ground state .",
    "we found that the linear term @xmath10 is also necessary , where @xmath11-constant is responsible for the internal ( compressive ) pressure .",
    "although the linear , anharmonic part is assumed to be very small in comparison to the harmonic one ( @xmath12 ) , its role is very important in balancing the internal ( expanding ) pressure produced by the anharmonic oscillators , i.e. , by the @xmath3 part .",
    "a certain requirement for @xmath11-values is imposed as the equilibrium condition for the whole energy , which is discussed later .",
    "the relative elastic deformation @xmath13 is defined by the relation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the crystal volume in a current thermodynamic state , and @xmath16 is the volume at external pressure @xmath17 ( vacuum ) and temperature @xmath18 . equation ( [ eq4 ] ) indicates that a non - zero value of volume deformation @xmath13 occurs when the external pressure @xmath19 and/or the temperature @xmath20 is applied .",
    "thus , a possibility of introducing the isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient has been opened within the presented approach . +",
    "a composition of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) consisting of the classical ( @xmath1 ) and quantum ( @xmath3 ) parts is justified for the purpose of constructing the thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "obtaining the free energy of the full system is one of the main goals and that can be conveniently done by summing up the free energies corresponding to those two parts .",
    "a similar modus operandi has also been presented in the paper ref .",
    "@xcite albeit for a different approach .",
    "it should be stressed that by introducing the elastic hamiltonian , @xmath1 , the static non - vibrational energy has been taken into account , which is crucial for the equation of state .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the method can be further generalized by introducing also the electronic part of the free energy @xcite .      in order to calculate the elastic ( helmholtz ) free energy",
    ", one has to evaluate the static internal energy and the static entropy .",
    "the static internal energy @xmath21 can be immediately found from the classical part of the hamiltonian : @xmath22 from eq.([eq2 ] ) it is seen that this energy is explicitly volume - dependent . on the other hand , the static entropy @xmath23 is connected with filling up the volume of the system in the absence of thermal movement .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the own volume occupied by @xmath5 atoms in the crystal state .",
    "for a given crystallographic lattice we can introduce the space filling coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , for fcc and hcp structures and the model of hard spheres @xmath26 .",
    "thus , inside each primitive cell @xmath27 is the probability of finding an atom , whereas @xmath28 is the probability of opposite event .",
    "the static entropy connected with the bimodal distribution @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 ) can be calculated from the mean value of @xmath31 , using the general formula for the exact differential of entropy : @xcite @xmath32 hence , in our case : @xmath33",
    "-n k_{\\mathrm b}c\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a constant of integration . since @xmath34 is arbitrary , as a matter of convenience we can choose @xmath35 .",
    "this arbitrariness is due to the fact that only changes in entropy are experimentally measurable and have thermodynamic significance @xcite .",
    "+ the entropy is additive with respect to the number of primitive cells @xmath5 . for the purpose of this paper",
    "it is assumed in the first approximation that the space - filling coefficient @xmath36 is volume independent and , in consequence , the corresponding entropy @xmath23 is constant .",
    "thus , the static entropy ( for @xmath35 ) results in the residual entropy of the crystal for @xmath37 , which is due to the fact that the whole volume is not perfectly filled .",
    "moreover , the important role of @xmath23 ( being dependent on @xmath36 ) may manifest itself in the structural ( 1st order ) phase transitions @xcite .",
    "+ the elastic , helmholtz free - energy can now be found from the formula : @xmath38 hence , we finally obtain : @xmath39 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the full thermodynamic description this energy should be completed by the vibrational , einstein part .      for the hamiltonian ( [ eq3 ] ) it is convenient to employ the canonical ensemble .",
    "the helmholtz free - energy can be found from the formula : @xmath40 where the statistical sum @xmath41 can be calculated exactly as : @xmath42^{-3n}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath44\\ ] ] on the other hand , the vibrational internal energy @xmath45 is given by the statistical mean value of the corresponding hamiltonian : @xmath46 hence , the vibrational entropy @xmath47 can be found from the relationship : @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the specific heat at constant @xmath15 is given by the well - known formula : @xmath49 where @xmath50 . + further , in order to improve the einstein model it is assumed that @xmath51 is not a constant but volume dependent according to the grneisen assumption @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the grneisen constant .",
    "thus , we can write : @xmath54 where we made use of the relation ( [ eq4 ] ) , and @xmath55 in ( [ eq16 ] ) is the einstein frequency in the ground state ( i.e. , at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath56 ) .",
    "then , the variable @xmath50 can be presented in the form of : @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 is the so - called einstein temperature .",
    "the correction of the einstein model presented by eq.([eq17 ] ) implies that all the thermodynamic potentials will depend on the volume via elastic deformation @xmath13 .",
    "the total helmholtz free - energy is given by the sum of expressions ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) , with the help of ( [ eq15])-([eq18 ] ) : @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\    & + & 3n k_{\\mathrm b } t \\ln \\ { 2 \\sinh \\left[\\frac{\\theta _",

    "the deformation @xmath13 is small too , and eq.([eq23 ] ) can be linearized as : @xmath67.\\ ] ] naturally , when @xmath17 then in the ground state is @xmath56 as well .",
    "consequently , we have to demand that the internal pressure of oscillators , which then is equal to @xmath68 , cancels out the pressure arising from the anharmonic , linear term , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "then the system is in equilibrium without any external force .",
    "the condition for this demand leads to the specific choice for the anharmonic constant @xmath11 , namely : @xmath70 where @xmath71 the energy constant @xmath72 presents a convenient unit for introduction of the dimensionless external pressure @xmath73 defined by : @xmath74 and the dimensionless temperature @xmath75 : @xmath76 with the above quantities , and eqs.([eq25 ] ) - ( [ eq26 ] ) , the equation of state ( [ eq23 ] ) takes the simple form : @xmath77.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([eq29 ] ) , obtained within the approximations assumed in this paper , presents a dimensionless equation of state from which the elastic deformation @xmath78 can be calculated for arbitrary temperature @xmath75 and external pressure @xmath73 .",

    "it is easy to show that from the formula ( [ eq30 ] ) all thermodynamic properties can be derived self - consistently .",
    "for instance , the total entropy fulfills the relationship : @xmath81 and , with the use of ( [ eq29 ] ) , it can be obtained in the dimensionless form : @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\   & - & 3\\ln \\ { 2 \\sinh \\left[\\frac{1}{\\tau \\left ( 1 + \\varepsilon \\right)^{\\gamma } } \\right ] \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the volume of the sample satisfies the equation : @xmath83 which again leads to the equation of state ( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "other thermodynamic properties follow from the second derivatives of the gibbs energy .",
    "for instance , the heat capacity at constant @xmath84 is given by : @xmath85 whereas the heat capacity at constant @xmath15 can be calculated from the relationship : @xmath86 on the other hand , the internal energy , @xmath87 , can be written in the dimensionless form : @xmath88.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] application of ( [ eq36 ] ) in ( [ eq35 ] ) leads to the dimensionless expression for @xmath89 : @xmath90 ^ 2 \\sinh ^{-2 } \\left[\\frac { 1}{\\tau \\left(1 + \\varepsilon \\right)^{\\gamma } } \\right].\\ ] ] it should be noted that for the particular case , when @xmath91 , eq.([eq37 ] ) is equivalent to formula ( [ eq14 ] ) . however , in general , a non - zero @xmath13 should be determined from the equation of state ( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "+ among other response functions which can be calculated either from the gibbs free energy , or from the equation of state is , for example , the thermal expansion coefficient : @xmath92 and the isothermal compressibility : @xmath93 in particular , for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. , in the ground state , these response functions can be obtained from the approximate equation of state ( [ eq24 ] ) . for this purpose , eq.([eq24 ] ) can be re - written in the form : @xmath94 it can be observed that eq.([eq40 ] ) for @xmath95 presents hooke s law at @xmath18 .",
    "further , we can formally make use of the linear expansion of volume , namely : @xmath96 it can be noticed that eq.([eq41 ] ) can equivalently be written as : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the response functions ( [ eq38 ] ) and ( [ eq39 ] ) , respectively , and these functions are taken in the ground state .",
    "now , by comparison of eqs.([eq40 ] ) and ( [ eq42 ] ) we obtain the result : @xmath100 and @xmath101 it is apparent that the both elastic coefficients , @xmath102 and @xmath9 , are important for determination of isothermal compressibility at @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath103 , where @xmath72 is the zero - point energy of einstein oscillators , it is obvious that for this compressibility an elastic energy plays a dominant role .",
    "finally , let us note that the equation of state derived by vinet et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath18 reduces for small @xmath84 to the form : @xmath104 , which agrees with our equation([eq40 ] ) in the limit @xmath105 .",
    "the grneisen parameter @xmath53 is introduced by the definition @xcite : @xmath106 which is equivalent to our relation ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "the typical experimental values of the grneisen parameter belong to the range @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "it can be mentioned that some particular definitions of that parameter , depending on the model , have been discussed in ref .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath53 is connected with the so - called grneisen equation : @xmath108 which has been tested extensively , especially in the low temperature region .",
    "it is worth noticing that the derivation of ( [ eq46 ] ) can be based on the exact thermodynamic identity : @xmath109 in the case in hand , in order to calculate @xmath110 , the equation of state @xmath111 should be taken in the form of ( [ eq23 ] ) .",
    "it can easily be checked that after the calculation of the derivative in ( [ eq47 ] ) , eq.([eq46 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it should also be noted that the calculations of all quantities in ( [ eq46 ] ) using the present method require prior solution of the equation of state ( [ eq29 ] ) . in particular , for the low - temperature region , where @xmath89 tends to zero according to the 3rd law of thermodynamics , we obtain from eq.([eq46 ] ) that @xmath112 .",
    "this limit is in agreement with the previous result ( [ eq43 ] ) .",
    "in order to perform the numerical calculations , based on the formulas from the preceding section , it is necessary to estimate the energy constants , from which @xmath72 and @xmath9 are the most important .",
    "the volume elastic modulus in the ground state , @xmath9 , can be found , for instance , from the sound velocity measurements and its experimental value is of the order ( @xmath113 ) j. in turn , @xmath72-coefficient is given by eq.([eq26 ] ) , where @xmath114 is the einstein temperature .",
    "assuming that @xmath114 is typically of the order @xmath115 k we can estimate @xmath72 as @xmath116 j. thus , the @xmath11-constant @xmath117 is about 2 orders smaller than the elastic bulk modulus @xmath9 , and the linear anharmonic term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq2 ] ) can be considered as a small correction to the harmonic one .",
    "this confirms the fact that such quantities as the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath118 ( eq . [ eq38 ] ) or the isothermal compressibility @xmath119 ( eq . [ eq39 ] ) are mainly determined by @xmath9-constant , not by @xmath72 .",
    "the above estimations of @xmath11 and @xmath9 constants , together with the assumed @xmath120 , yield from eq.([eq38 ] ) @xmath121 1/k for the temperatures near the einstein temperature , which is a physically reasonable order of value . in the same token assuming a realistic amount of volume per atom , i.e. , @xmath122 , we obtain on the basis of eq.([eq39 ] ) @xmath123 1/pa , which is also a correct order for the isothermal compressibility .",
    "+ although the anharmonic elastic energy @xmath124 is a small correction in comparison to the harmonic one , it can be of the same order of magnitude as the vibrational energy resulting from einstein oscillators .",
    "therefore , this anharmonic term is vital in balancing the expanding pressure resulting from oscillators , in the case when the frequency is volume dependent ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "the expanding pressure arises owing to the decrease of the energy ( frequency ) of oscillators when they experience collective excitations in increasing volume .",
    "the total equilibrium of the system requires balancing of the internal ( stretching ) forces resulting from expanding quantum oscillators , internal compressive forces of the elastic medium and the external pressure @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting deformation @xmath13 is temperature and pressure dependent and can be calculated from the equation of state ( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "the other energy constants , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , play merely a correcting role in modeling the static potential , and are important for high temperatures where the elastic deformation @xmath13 is significant .",
    "the exemplary numerical results , presented in this section in figs.1 - 8 , are obtained for the following set of parameters : @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",

    "this emphasizes the pronounced importance of the exact form of the static lattice potential for pressure studies , since the deformations here exceed 10% .",
    "the selected potential provides reliable description for pressures up to 10 kbar . in light of the assumption that our static elastic potential originates from the expansion at the point @xmath18 and @xmath17 , further adjusting the potential would improve the consistency between calculations and experimental data for higher pressures .",
    "it can be concluded , on the basis of figs .",
    "9 - 13 , that the agreement between calculated lines and the experimental data is quite satisfactory .",
    "one should take into account that all these curves have been calculated selfconsistently for the same set of parameters , as described above in this subsection .",
    "it can be supposed that the fitting could even be better if we would allow the grneisen parameter to vary with temperature and pressure , as it has been suggested from the experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "as far as the specific heat is concerned , the new result ( solid line ) differs only insignificantly from the einstein result ( dashed ) , and the difference is mainly noteworthy at high temperatures .",
    "however , it should be noted that the dashed line in fig.12 is the only result of the pure einstein model which can be compared with all these experimental data .",
    "the full description of temperature dependencies of remaining quantities , such as @xmath185 and @xmath118 has been possible in the improved approach to the einstein model , when the equation of state ( [ eq29 ] ) is taken into account .      in the present paper a simple combination of the einstein and elastic models of solid state",
    "is presented .",
    "first of all , the dependency of frequency of quantum oscillators on the volume has been introduced in a simplified way via grneisen assumption .",
    "simultaneously , the elastic properties of the crystal have been taken into account via classical hamiltonian , containing anharmonic terms .",
    "+ an idea that the free - energy is a sum of several components has been presented , for instance , in the book of wallace @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown that exploitation of this idea led us to the new form of the equation of state ( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the birch - murnaghan equation of state , which presents only isothermal description @xcite , in our equation the temperature @xmath171 plays a role equivalent to the rest of variables , i.e. , @xmath84 and @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , the thermal expansion coefficient , as well as the isothermal compressibility have simultaneously been derived from this new equation of state .",
    "it is well - known that these quantities could not be inferred from the sole einstein model .",
    "on the other hand , our equation of state includes also the pressure resulting from expanding quantum oscillators .",
    "moreover , comparing our method with the papers based on the wallace approach , one should notice that one of our anharmonic parameters in the static potential , namely @xmath11 , is not independent , but has been related to the einstein temperature ( via eqs .",
    "[ eq27 ] and [ eq28 ] ) . as we pointed out",
    ", such relationship assures that the equilibrium condition for the total free energy at @xmath17 and @xmath18 is satisfied and the system of quantum oscillators becomes stable .",
    "when this point is not discussed , the functional form of the static lattice energy can also be adopted in the form given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( after vinet et al . ) .",
    "that form is much more complicated than our polynomial approach , nevertheless it has successfully been applied for very high pressures .",
    "+ the present method requires several constant parameters , such as : the einstein temperature , isothermal compressibility ( or the volume elastic modulus ) at the absolute zero temperature , as well as the grneisen parameter , which should be taken from experiment .",
    "+ the region of applicability of the model ( its temperature and pressure range of validity ) is mainly connected with the number of terms which are taken into account in the polynomial form of elastic hamiltonian ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "this form is based on the assumption that the equilibrium central point is @xmath186 for @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the theory is best applicable for the expansion around this equilibrium . however , as we have seen on the example of solid argon , merely first four terms were sufficient to describe deformation @xmath13 in a wide range ; starting from @xmath187 ( near the melting temperature and @xmath17 , fig.9 ) down to @xmath188 ( for @xmath189 k and @xmath190 kbar , fig.13 ) .",
    "of course , validity of the model for lower values of @xmath191 ( for very high pressure , where anharmonicity of static potential plays a role ) would require higher order terms in ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "one should also remember that our assumption concerning the space filling coefficient ( @xmath192 ) would not be fulfilled at extremely high pressures .",
    "as far as the vibrational anharmonic effects are considered , they all are taken into account by the effective grneisen parameter @xmath53 .",
    "we think that the approach is useful in the range of temperatures up to the melting point . in conclusion",
    ", the presented formulation allows for a complete thermodynamic description of the system in a relatively wide range of external pressure and temperature .",
    "our considerations are related to the quasistatic processes .",
    "therefore , the shock - wave experiments can not be described within this model .",
    "+ it should be noted that the method is relatively simple , gives analytical form of the equation of state , and therefore it can serve as a first approximation for more advanced approaches .",
    "for instance , in the prototype calculations we have used only single variable @xmath13 for description of the volume elastic deformation .",
    "however , it seems possible to generalize the approach for anisotropic deformations and anisotropic external pressures , involving also the poisson coefficient .",
    "the presented method can be potentially extended basing on the debye approximation , in which the linear dispersion relation for collective excitations together with the proper density of states are taken into consideration .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the vibrational free energy has been taken into account in the high temperature debye model . in that approach each moment of the density of states",
    "function requires a separate grneisen parameter , which makes the method much more complicated . on the other hand , for metallic systems the electronic part of the free - energy",
    "should also be included @xcite .",
    "however , such extensions of the method need further studies and should be a subject of separate assignment .",
