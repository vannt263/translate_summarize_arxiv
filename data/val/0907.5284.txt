    "following wallace , decoherence is not only unable to do this job , but causes even problems with empirical viability .",
    "this was sufficient motivation to evaluate this thesis in more detail .",
    "once empirical viability is questioned , the natural place to look for is the equivalence proof between pilot wave theory and quantum theory . considering this proof in section [ sec : proof ] , we find it necessary to include the state of the observer into the picture .",
    "the measurement device is not enough  once there exists doubts if the observer really observes the state of the measurement device , one has to consider the full picture . as a consequence",
    "we need only the actual , unobserved observer state .",
    "the equivalence theorem in this form would remain valid even if the beables themself would be unobservable .",
    "the only loophole which could prevent the recovery of quantum predictions is the question if different macroscopic states can be distinguished by the beables , or , in other words , if these states have negligible overlap as functions of the beables . for the particular case of field beables ,",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the overlaps become negligible for large particle numbers .",
    "but field theory is only a particular example .",
    "one should expect that more fundamental physical theories give other , more fundamental candidates for the beables  strings , loops , or cells as proposed in @xcite  which give the observable fields only in the large distance limit .",
    "their configuration variables ( assuming some lagrange formalism ) are natural candidates for pilot wave beables .",
    "we obviously have to expect that their connection to the decoherence - preferred observables is different from that in field theory .",
    "this leads to some questions : what is the possible relation between pilot wave beables and decoherence in such a more general situation ?",
    "while the decoherence - preferred particle variables differ from the field variables , there exist , nonetheless , some nontrivial connection between them .",
    "what if there is no such connection ?",
    "if there is a connection , how does it appear ?",
    "if it appears in some more or less natural way , what are the consequences ? does this connection have an influence on the ability of pilot wave theories to recover quantum predictions ?",
    "these are the questions we want to study in this paper .",
    "the answers we find are quite positive for pilot wave theories with more fundamental beables : if there is absolutely no connection between beables and decoherence , we can even prove a theorem that the overlap becomes insignificant .",
    "on the other hand , we find that a connection has to be expected : decoherence starts from a predefined decomposition into systems , and such a decomposition can be obtained in a reasonable way only from the beables .",
    "this leads to a non - trivial connection , where different systems have independent sets of beables .",
    "we find that this leads to some preference for product states .",
    "while this makes it impossible to apply our general theorem , it appears plausible that in this case the overlap descreases approximately exponentially with an increasing number of system .",
    "wallace s thesis claims that pilot wave beables have to be decoherence - preferred to recover quantum predictions . to reject it , it is sufficient to consider one equivalence proof which does not depend on this assumption . in our case ,",
    "a quite standard version of the proof seems sufficient . on the other hand , in another",
    "equally standard , but inferior variant wallace s thesis looks quite natural .",
    "the version of the equivalence proof which does not depend on it is enough to falsify wallace s thesis , but the other variant gives us some interesting hint about the origin of this thesis .",

    ", let s consider the general scheme of a quantum measurement in pilot wave theory .",
    "we restrict ourself in this paper to the simplest case of a measurement with two discrete eigenstates .",
    "this seems sufficient : as human beings , we can distinguish only finite numbers of different states , and , given that the number of particles in macroscopic states is much larger than the number of states we can distinguish , the number of the discrete states does not really matter .",
    "so assume we have a quantum system @xmath0 in the initial state @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement is an interaction with the remaining part of the universe which measures the projection operator @xmath3  an operator with two eigenvalues , @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for all other states .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian may be something like @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the momentum operator of some unspecified pointer variable .",
    "for the system - internal hamilton operator we simply set @xmath9 .",
    "as the initial state of the wave function of the universe we assume a product state @xmath10 where @xmath11 describes the remaining part of the universe .",
    "after the interaction , we obtain some superpositional state @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are already different states .",
    "all the time , the conditional wave function @xmath15 obtained by putting the actual value of @xmath16 into the wave function of the universe is well - defined and correctly defines the guiding equation for @xmath17 .",
    "but in general it does not follow the effective schrdinger equation of the system ( which would be trivial for @xmath9 ) : during the measurement , it evolves in dependence of @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is the effective collapse process .",
    "the collapse is finished if the two wave functions @xmath19 no longer overlap , and if this property is stable in time .",
    "after this , the conditional wave function @xmath20 no longer collapses and becomes an effective wave function , that means , it follows the ( in our case trivial ) schrdinger equation of the system . if ( for fixed @xmath21 ) the @xmath22 do not overlap , the conditions @xmath23 define a decomposition into two sets @xmath24 with @xmath25 for @xmath26 the effective wave function of the system appears to be @xmath27 .",
    "if the wave function of the universe is in quantum equilibrium , this happens with probability @xmath28 .",
    "all this corresponds nicely with the description given by quantum theory .",
    "the only difference is the following : for a quantum measurement being finished , the @xmath11 should be in macroscopically different states . in pilot wave theory , we have to require that the @xmath22 do not overlap , and that this condition remains stable in time .",
    "all we have to prove is that pilot wave theory recovers quantum predictions , thus , we need only one direction .",
    "moreover we can assume that macroscopically different states remain to be macroscopically different in time .",
    "therefore , all we need to recover quantum predictions is the hypothesis that _ macroscopically different states @xmath22 do not overlap as functions of the pilot wave beable @xmath11_.    note that the configuration @xmath11 , as the configuration of the rest of the universe , contains also the configuration of the observer @xmath29 himself .",
    "the condition that the observer has seen the result is of course different , more restrictive than the condition that the measurement has been finished .",
    "but it is quite close : all we need is that the configurations of the observer @xmath29 are different for different measurement results .",
    "thus , there should be a decomposition into two sets @xmath30 with @xmath31 in other words , @xmath29 should be already sufficient to distinguish different measurement results .",
    "it is also worth to note that the whole consideration is based on really existing objects , not on observed objects . according to pilot wave theory ,",
    "the wave function of the universe @xmath32 , as well as the configuration @xmath33 , really exist .",
    "thus , the conditional wave function we have constructed based on these ingredients also really exists .",
    "as well , the quantum equilibrium distribution is a distribution for the actual , real values of @xmath33 .",
    "last but not least , @xmath29 describes the real configuration of the observer , who , therefore , is in really different states if @xmath34 for different @xmath35 . none of these objects is observed in some way , nor is there any necessity for them of being observed",
    ".    this seems different if we , instead of including the observer @xmath29 into the pilot wave picture , follow the copenhagen quantum scheme , where the observer is located in the classical part , outside the quantum domain .",
    "everything else seems similar , with @xmath11 being replaced by the configuration of some measurement device @xmath36 .",
    "but , once we have not included the observer into the picture , we can not consider the observers real configuration @xmath29 . as a consequence , lot s of unnecessary questions",
    "appear : the observer has to observe , somehow , the result of the measurement",
    ". what does he observe if he looks at the device ?",
    "the wave function @xmath37 of the measurement device or , instead , the actual value of @xmath36 ?",
    "is it justified to put the actual value @xmath36 into the wave function , or should we use , instead , some observed value of @xmath36 ? maybe the observation is fooled like the particle detectors in @xcite ? in this incomplete picture , these questions seem unavoidable and difficult to answer . examples of arguments of this type have been given by wallace and brown :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` suppose we accept that it is the entered wavepacket that determines the outcome of the measurement .",

    "everything else remains unchanged .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath112 with the same conclusion .",
    "thus , if there is no connection at all , everything is fine .",
    "but this is an assumption we can not rely on . at the other extreme",
    ", we have an explicit counterexample where the overlap never becomes negligible , so that the standard equivalence proof fails .",
    "this example is one - particle theory , artificially described with a field ontology . in this case , in agreement with the results of struyve @xcite , we have found in @xcite that all states have an overlap of at least @xmath113  the universal overlap for orthogonal one - particle states in field theory .",
    "what are the characteristic properties of this example which lead to this failure of the equivalence proof ?",
    "we can find several very special properties , which , in combination , allow to explain this failure :    * first , there is an additional non - trivial conservation law  the conservation of particle number . without this , the counterexample would not work .",
    "it would be possible to obtain states with higher number of particles , which already have negligible overlap .",
    "in particular , an approximate conservation of particle number is not sufficient : it only increases the decoherence time . *",
    "second , we have an extremal choice of the initial value  only one particle . with a much larger number of particles ,",
    "say , @xmath114 , the problem would disappear as well . *",
    "last but not least , we have a special relation between the field ontology and the decoherence - preferred observables : the decoherence - preferred states with fixed particle number are localized in a certain environment of the vacuum state in the field variables . as well , without this special relation , the problem would disappear , as a consequence of theorem [ th : complex ]",
    ".    given the thesis of wallace that the pilot wave variables have to be decoherence - preferred , there is a certain irony in the observation that some non - trivial connection between pilot wave variables and decoherence - preferred variables is necessary for the things going wrong .",
    "unfortunately , in the physically interesting cases , in particular in field theory , we can not apply our theorems [ th : real ] , [ th : complex ] , because we have some nontrivial connection between decoherence - preferred observables and beables .",
    "even if , in the case of field theory , there is no identity , they are far away from being completely unrelated , so that one can not assume that the macroscopic states generated by decoherence are independent random states .",
    "the question we want to consider now is if there is some natural connection between them .    in this context",
    "it becomes important to observe that the hamilton operator taken alone does not allow to define `` the '' decoherence - preferred basis @xcite .",
    "one needs more , namely a `` decomposition into systems '' , to define a decoherence - preferred basis . where does this `` decomposition into systems '' come from ?",
    "decoherence theory remains silent , it takes the decomposition as given . the particular subdivision into the various systems we see around us  stars , planets , stones , cats , and human beings",
    " can be defined only in some environment of the actual state of the universe . for other possible states of the universe  for example , states where the earth does not even exist  the system which defines , for example , a given cat simply does not make sense .",
    "thus , in interpretations like many worlds , which do not have some well - defined actual configuration of the universe as pilot wave interpretations , we have also no natural subdivision around this state into systems .    leaving this problem to these interpretations ( see @xcite for more ) let s continue with the situation in pilot wave theory . here",
    "we have some basis for a derivation of a decomposition into subsystems we need for decoherence .",
    "indeed , pilot wave theory defines , at every moment of time @xmath21 , some well - defined configuration of the universe @xmath115 .",
    "this configuration can be used to develop some linear theory in the tangent space @xmath116 of the configuration space @xmath117 at @xmath41 .",
    "the various systems we see around us may be identified with linear subspaces of @xmath118 .",
    "this is , of course , not the place to consider possible details of such a construction .",
    "the only point we want to make here is that the tangent space @xmath118 at @xmath41 is a very natural ecological niche for the definition of all these subsystems .",
    "if we use this place to define the subsystems , the decomposition @xmath119 of the tangent space gives a corresponding decomposition @xmath120 of the hilbert space @xmath121 , which approximates @xmath122 in the environment of @xmath123 .",
    "the notion of `` approximation '' used here is also a specific property of pilot wave theories : the guiding equation for some finite time interval depends only on the wave function in the relevant environment of @xmath117 , so that the restriction of the global wave function to some environment can be considered as a meaningful approximation  an argumentation which is not valid in other interpretations .",
    "now , the decomposition @xmath120 already defines a natural decomposition of @xmath121 into systems which can be used to start decoherence considerations .",
    "if we use a construction of this type to obtain the decomposition into systems , we obtain , automatically , a natural connection between the pilot wave beables , which describe the configuration space @xmath117 , and the decoherence - preferred observables derived starting with the decomposition @xmath119 : for each of the subsystems @xmath124 we have , by construction , separate pilot wave beables @xmath125 , that means , the decomposition into systems coinsides with a decomposition of the pilot wave beables .    from point of view of pure theory ,",
    "this relation is problematic : our theorem [ th : complex ] , which would be sufficient for our purpose , is not applicable once something very special happens  we can not rely on the assumption that the states created by decoherence are independent random states .",
    "is there a special property of the states which could prevent us from applying theorem [ th : complex ] ?",
    "such a property should be stable in time  else , it could be rejected as unimportant . but",
    "decompositions into subsystems are useful exactly because the subsystems develop almost independently in time . in particular states which are product states",
    "initially remain product states with high probability .",
    "moreover , local interactions of some systems with their local environments tend to destroy superpositions between such product states . in pilot wave theories",
    ", this works in the following way : if a system @xmath126 in a superpositional state @xmath127 with some far away system @xmath128 interacts with its local environment @xmath129 , this gives some superposition @xmath130 of the local environment @xmath129 to obtain an effective wave function for the two systems .",
    "if @xmath131 is not in the overlap of the two functions @xmath132 , this gives or @xmath133 , or @xmath134 , destroying the superposition between the pure product states .",
    "giving these two effects  stability of product states because of independent evolution of the systems , and reduction to product states because of independent interactions of particular systems with their particular environments  we have to expect that the states obtained by decoherence have a tendency to be product states . given the connection between decoherence and pilot wave theory , products of states of subsystems appear to be product states in terms of the corresponding pilot wave beables @xmath135 : @xmath136 thus , the theorem [ th : complex ] is not sufficient in a situation where the systems used by decoherence are subsystems of beables , because the probability distribution of the states created by decoherence is not random , but has a preference for product states .",
    "we can not present a comparable proof for this general situation .",
    "nonetheless , it appears sufficiently plausible that nothing dangerous happens .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of @xmath137 orthogonal particles we have considered in @xcite : the n - particle states considered there have been also product states of one - particle states .",
    "as in this case , we have no simple product rule  the product of the overlaps gives only a lower bound of the overlap of the product states .",
    "nonetheless , there are good reasons to expect that the decrease is sufficiently fast : indeed , it seems not unreasonable to expect that the overlap of the product states decreases in a similar way as the overlap of the n - particle states . in this case",
    ", the decrease would be approximately exponential in the number of different degrees systems @xmath135 , which is much more than we need to distinguish macroscopically different states .",
    "the plausibility arguments we have used in @xcite for the n - particle product state can be applied in the case of general product states : the distance between the maximal values of @xmath138 of the two product functions @xmath139 can be easily computed . indeed , whatever the functions @xmath140 which participate in products @xmath141 of positive - valued functions @xmath142 , the maximum will be reached in the points where every function reaches it s maximum .",
    "therefore , the distance @xmath143 between the maxima of the products can be obtained from the corresponding distances for the factors @xmath144 by the simple formula @xmath145 .",
    "thus , it is increasing with the number of factors .",
    "some plausible expectations about the behaviour of the overlap can be obtained if we consider the case of equal factor functions @xmath146 for all @xmath35 . in this case , the distance between the maxima increases as @xmath147 .",
    "let s also look at the line connecting the maxima .",
    "assume , the two functions @xmath148 have only one maximum @xmath149 at @xmath150 and decrease with distance from the maximum .",
    "then , in the one - dimensional case , there can be only one local maximum @xmath151 $ ] of the overlap function  the point @xmath152 defined by @xmath153 .",
    "then , on the line connecting the two maxima in the n - dimensional case , the overlap function reaches it s maximum at the point @xmath154 , and this maximal value is @xmath155 .",
    "now , given that the integrals @xmath156 of functions with maxima @xmath157 give @xmath4 , we can expect the order of the corresponding overlap integral as being roughly proportional to the relation of the maxima .",
    "this relation is @xmath158 , thus , it decreases exponentially with @xmath137 .",
    "this gives a plausibility argument that the overlap integral will decrease approximately exponentially with the number of systems .",
    "an extremal case where we can compute the overlap exactly is the case where the wave functions can have only two values : @xmath6 and @xmath4 . in these cases ,",
    "the overlap for each system consists of the normalized area of the configuration space where above functions are @xmath4 . for product states of this type , the overlap is the product of the normalized areas of the subsystems , thus , the product of the probabilities of overlap for the subsystems",
    ". if all subsystems are of the same type , thus , give the same overlap proability @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath159 as the overlap probability for @xmath51 systems .",
    "this gives , again , the expectation that the overlap decreases exponentially with the number of systems .",
    "in @xcite we have made some numerical computations of overlap integrals for product states for some other functions .",
    "the results also support the thesis that the overlap decreases approximately exponentially with the number of systems .",
    "all these are , of course , only plausibility arguments . as well , we have considered here only the two extremal situations : independent random states , and pure product states",
    ". the general situation will be some mixture .    nonetheless , with these plausibility arguments",
    "the advantage in burden tennis is already quite large : we have not only the general theorem as the default assumption .",
    "we have also found lot s of arguments for the most plausible derivation from the default assumption  product states instead of random states . additionally there is a large gap between the fast , exponential decrease which seems plausible and the minimal decrease which would be sufficient to preserve the phenomena , given the large numbers of particles in macroscopic states .",
    "given that the apparatus of quantum theory depends on such uncertain notions as macroscopic states , we should not expect much more .",
    "thus , the current situation seems close enough to the ideal one . designing new pilot wave theories",
    ", we are free to introduce whatever beables we prefer . while there is some theoretical possibility that the equivalence theorem fails for the resulting theory , it is sufficiently plausible that in general it does not .",
    "motivated by wallace s thesis that pilot wave beables have to be decoherence - preferred to allow a recovery of quantum theory predictions , we have studied the connection between pilot wave beables and decoherence .",
    "wallace s thesis has to be rejected : on the contrary , if we have no connection at all between decoherence and pilot wave beables , we can prove that the overlaps between macroscopic states become insignificant , which is sufficient to recover quantum predictions .",
    "on the other hand , we have found that we have to expect a nontrivial connection between decoherence and pilot wave beables .",
    "the point is that decoherence depends on the choice of a decomposition into systems , and we have found that the natural environmental niche for such a decomposition is closely connected with the beables . in this case",
    ", we have to expect that the states created by decoherence are not random , but have some preference for product states .",
    "fortunately , product states do not seem problematic as well .",
    "we have presented plausibility arguments that the overlap between product states decreases exponentially with the number of systems .",
    "that means , in above extremal cases  random states as well as pure product states  the overlap decreases sufficiently fast . thus , there is no reason to expect something wrong happens in the general case .    in special circumstances , the overlap may always remain significant : in the counterexample of one - particle theory described with field beables",
    ", we have an additional conservation law ( particle number ) and a very special initial value ( one ) for the conserved value as particular circumstances which force the overlap to remain significant . in the general case",
    ", it seems quite implausible that such things happen .",
    "thus , given the results of this paper , one can leave to burden of argumentation to those who doubt that a particular pilot wave theory is viable .",
    "the rejection of wallace s thesis allows to use decoherence as a useful , important tool in pilot wave theories .",
    "the tangential space at the actual configuration @xmath41 of the universe gives an ecological niche for decompositions of the degrees of freedom of the universe into systems .",
    "starting with such a decomposition into systems , we can apply decoherence to find out which are the most stable , most accessible observables .",
    "these observables are not necessarily the beables themself  instead , as in the example of field theories , some sort of particles or quasiparticles may be decoherence - preferred , while the fundamental beables are not . in such a context , decoherence appears to be a useful tool to find out what will be observable .",
    "thus , the connection between decoherence and pilot wave theory is symbiotic : the actual configuration @xmath41 and its environment defines a place for the decomposition into systems , which is a necessary prerequisite for decoherence . in return",

    "<S> this is sufficient to recover quantum predictions , so that wallace s thesis has to be rejected .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural connection between decoherence and beables appears if the decomposition into systems used by decoherence is based on the beables . while our first result becomes inapplicable in this case , we present evidence that the overlap becomes negligible too . </S>"
