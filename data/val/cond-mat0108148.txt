    "the localization of vibrational energy in discrete nonlinear arrays has attracted a huge amount of interest in the past 15 years as a possible mechanism for the efficient storage and transport of energy .",
    "the reasons for the broad interest in these phenomena are at least two - fold : on the one hand , they embody many of the interesting effects of the interplay of nonlinearity , discretization , and stochasticity , and on the other they may be of use in explaining a variety of physical and biophysical phenomena .",
    "the interest in nonlinear arrays serving as energy storage and transfer assemblies for chemical or photochemical processes is not uncommon  @xcite , and literature on the subject goes back for two decades  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the localization and transport of vibrational energy has been invoked in a number of physical settings including dna molecules  @xcite , hydrocarbon structures  @xcite , the creation of vibrational intrinsic localized modes in anharmonic crystals  @xcite , photonic crystal waveguides  @xcite , and targeted energy transfer between donors and acceptors in biomolecules  @xcite .",
    "many types of nonlinear arrays exhibit spontaneous localization , and in each of these the conditions that lead to localization are complex and multifaceted .",
    "a vast literature deals not only with different types of arrays but with issues such as boundary conditions , initial conditions , whether the system is closed or forced , thermal effects , etc .",
    "it is impossible to present here a full catalog or even sensibly organized panorama of results ; a number of excellent reviews have aided greatly in the effort  @xcite .",
    "increasing attention has recently been devoted to thermalized nonlinear arrays . whether energy can be transmitted without the destructive thermal and dispersive degradation that occurs in harmonic lattices",
    "is clearly an important question : one thinks , for example , about the amazing energy transfer cascade occurring in the photosynthetic process  @xcite , or about the ability of some proteins to efficiently store and transport and thereby convert chemical energy into mechanical energy  @xcite .",
    "transport across a thermal gradient and questions concerning the validity of the usual fourier law have very recently been addressed in a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "relaxation to thermal equilibrium and the nature of this equilibrium have been addressed in recent work  @xcite , as has the transport of energy in thermal arrays  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the phonons associated with the linear portion of the potential in a nonlinear array , a variety of stationary , and non - stationary but long - lived , excitations are possible , including solitons  @xcite ( long - wavelength excitations that persist from the continuum limit upon discretization ) , periodic breathers  @xcite ( spatially localized time periodic excitations that persist from the anticontinuous limit upon coupling ) , and so - called chaotic breathers  @xcite ( localized excitations that evolve chaotically ) . these nonlinear excitations arise ( even spontaneously ) and survive for a long time in numerical experiments , and they clearly play an important role in determining the global macroscopic properties of nonlinear extended systems .",

    "the temperature dependence of the nonlinear array spectra is considerably more complex .",
    "the purely hard fpu chain ( short dashed lines ) shows a broader spectrum , consistent with the fact that at energies around 0.5 ( viz . our temperature ) , oscillator frequencies associated with a purely hard potential are higher than that of a harmonic oscillator ( cf .",

    "the mixed chain ( long dashed lines ) has a broader spectrum than the harmonic or purely hard arrays at any temperature , again consistent with the inset .",
    "whereas the harmonic array only supports extended modes ( phonons ) , some of the frequencies for the purely hard and mixed arrays are associated with nonlinear modes that include ( especially at high frequencies ) localized modes .",
    "furthermore , it should be remembered that whereas each phonon mode is characterized by a single frequency , each nonlinear mode in general involves many frequencies .",

    "this causes the total energy of the chain to decay through these end points . in all our simulations we set @xmath39 .",

    "[ figsw ] we display the evolution of the spectra for each of the chains .",
    "the spectral rendition is revealing because it clearly indicates that the decay mechanisms for harmonic and each of the anharmonic arrays are entirely different .",

    "the decay is exponential with time constant @xmath52 ( @xmath53 in the figure ) , and then at times larger than this time the decay changes to @xmath54 .",
    "the exponential decay time is that associated with the lowest frequency phonon modes since they have the shortest decay times .",
    "the power law relaxation arises from a cascade of different decay times of the different phonon modes .",
    "eventually the decay becomes exponential again when only the highest frequency modes survive , but the energy in our chain is too low at that point to be picked up within our precision .",
    "a well - known but important point needs to be made here so that the contrasting behavior of anharmonic chains can be clarified later : the phonons in the harmonic chain are of course _ independent _ of one another , and each has to be absorbed by the cold reservoir separately . as noted above , each is absorbed on a different time scale . in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ figsw ] we show the spectrum of the harmonic chain at different times during the relaxation process , starting with the initial thermalized spectrum ( in this figure @xmath55 of fig .  [ figswt0 ] ) .",
    "the evolution confirms that _ low _ frequencies decay more rapidly in the harmonic chain ",
    "the spectrum is absorbed by the cold reservoir from the bottom up , and by time @xmath56 only the longer - lived band - edge modes remain in the system .",

    "[ figevol ] shows the time evolution of the local spatial energy landscape using a gray scale to contrast higher - energy ( darker ) from lower - energy ( lighter ) regions .",
    "the purely hard array relaxes more rapidly than the harmonic and the energy decays essentially exponentially , indicating a single predominant decay channel .",
    "note that being a purely quartic chain , there are no phonons in this system .",
    "we also observe in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ figsw ] that higher frequency excitations relax first . at time",
    "@xmath56 only low frequency excitations remain in the chain .",
    "this behavior is exactly opposite to that of the harmonic chain .",
    "we find that the dominant relaxation mechanism is for the high frequency portions of the spectrum to degrade into lower frequency excitations , as schematically indicated by the sloped arrows in fig .",
    "[ figswesq ] .",
    "such a degradation is possible here since individual frequencies are not associated with normal modes in the anharmonic system . in turn ,",
    "these lower frequency excitations decay into the reservoir .",
    "specifically , the high frequency components of the spectrum are mainly due to mobile localized modes that degrade into lower energy excitations as they move and collide with one another , and this degradation occurs with a relatively short time constant that is shorter for localized modes that have a higher velocity .",
    "the lower frequency excitations are in turn absorbed into the cold reservoir but continue to be replenished through the degradation process .",
    "we conjecture that the absorption of the lowest frequency components defines the observed exponential decay constant of the total chain energy .",
    "however , and importantly , among the low frequency excitations are some that persist for a very long time , certainly beyond the times of our simulations .",
    "these , which are the only remaining spectral components at time @xmath56 , are  labeled \" by short downward arrows in the relaxation schematic and include rather stable breather and/or soliton modes that move very slowly and are localized away from the boundaries . at the same time , some portion of the high frequency spectrum is also directly absorbed by the cold reservoir ( indicated by the short downward arrow in the high frequency region of fig .",
    "[ figswesq ] ) .",
    "for example , when a highly mobile localized excitation reaches a boundary it may be absorbed directly by the reservoir ( or it may be reflected and return into the chain with some energy loss ) .",
    "the role of high - frequency mobile modes and of low - frequency slowly moving or stationary modes in this picture will be tested in more detail in the next section , where we explicitly inject a high - frequency localized mode into the array and observe the relaxation dynamics .",
    "we do note here that our picture is consistent with known facts about localized states .",
    "in particular , it is known that higher - frequency and/or higher amplitude localized modes can move at higher velocities  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that while in motion such modes lose energy through collisions with other excitations .",
    "also , fig .",
    "[ figdecay ] shows a faster decay at higher temperatures , which is consistent with our observations elsewhere that the speed of an injected pulse ( and therefore , we conjecture , the speed of a moving localized mode ) in these arrays increases with temperature  @xcite . the energy landscape associated with these descriptions",
    "is shown in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ figevol ] .",
    "= 4.in    almost all fpu analyses in the literature involve arrays that include both harmonic and anharmonic contributions , but the distinct role of each has not been clarified .",
    "our relaxation results show an interesting sequence of relaxation behaviors . at early times",
    "the mixed array relaxes more rapidly than the harmonic , because there are low - frequency excitations close to harmonic phonons ( but note that phonons are no longer exact normal modes ) _ and _ high - frequency excitations in the system . energy relaxation and",
    "decay thus involves _ both _ of the mechanisms discussed above .",
    "again , because initially the high - frequency modes move more rapidly at higher temperature , the early time decay is faster at higher temperatures .",
    "that both low and high frequency modes relax rapidly is clearly seen in the third panel of fig .",
    "[ figsw ] , which quickly loses both low ( as in the first panel ) and high ( as in the second panel ) frequency portions of the spectrum . in the energy decay curve",
    "there is then a crossing after which the mixed chain relaxes much more _ slowly _ than the harmonic and the purely anharmonic .",
    "this occurs when the low frequency modes ( phonons ) have essentially all decayed , and only certain high - frequency spectral components remain , as clearly seen in the spectrum .",
    "we conjecture that these persistent modes are localized _ quasi - stationary _ breathers that decay extremely slowly , and again pursue this notion in the next section . the associated decay schematic",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figswesq ] .",
    "note that with increasing temperatures the stationary breathers are more energetic , leading to a slower decay of the total chain energy at long times .",
    "indeed , we find that the very slow decay at long times is a stretched exponential , as shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ figmixto ] shows the stretched exponential behavior for various arrays and clearly points to a @xmath13-dependent but @xmath61 and @xmath38-independent exponent @xmath62 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath62 with increasing initial temperature is explained by the greater stability of more energetic breathers .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath38 independence is explained by the fact that the rate - limiting step in the slow relaxation is the leakage by the breather .",
    "the low - energy output of this leakage is quickly absorbed by the cold reservoir  @xcite .",
    "these results immediately raise a question that in hindsight pervades a number of results throughout the literature : if both the purely quartic chains and also the mixed chains support high - frequency localized solutions , why do these modes relax so rapidly in the former but seem to persist for very long times in the latter ?",
    "the answer lies in the crucial role of the quadratic terms of the potential and the consequent behavior of the low - frequency portion of the spectrum . when localized solutions ( breathers ) are sufficiently strongly perturbed , they respond by moving  @xcite and hence to the degradation process described earlier . in a mixed chain , the low - frequency excitations ( phonons ) that can easily perturb breathers decay quickly , and at later times only the essentially unperturbed",
    "high - frequency breathers remain .",
    "these almost - stationary solutions of the system hardly move . since localized breather modes tend to lose their energy only while they move",
    ", these quasi - stationary breathers can persist for a very long time . in the purely anharmonic chain ,",
    "on the other hand , there are no phonons and the low - frequency excitations include slowly - moving quasistationary anharmonic modes that persist for a long time and that continue to perturb the high frequency localized modes . these energetic localized modes thus continue to move and collide with the low - frequency modes , resulting in degradation into lower energy excitations .    the third panel in fig .",
    "[ figevol ] shows the spontaneous appearance , slowing motion , and eventual stoppage of a breather in the mixed chain .",
    "it is this breather , absent from the purely hard array , that mainly leads to the persistent high - frequency spectral contributions and to the extremely slow relaxation of the mixed chain energy at long times .",
    "= 2.in = 2.in = 2.in",
    "in the previous section we portrayed a relaxation dynamic for anharmonic fpu arrays that involves a very specific view of the roles of high - frequency localized modes , low - frequency anharmonic modes , and phonons . in order to further test these ideas , in this section we start again with the thermalized chain , but now we inject a high - amplitude localized excitation at time @xmath63 in the center of the chain . specifically , we inject an odd - parity excitation ( amplitude @xmath64 at site @xmath65 and @xmath66 at each immediately adjacent site ) .",
    "these displacements lead to an exact breather solution for the interaction potential @xmath67 as @xmath68 ( as does the even - parity breather of amplitude @xmath64 at one site and @xmath69 at an immediately adjacent site ) , and are quite close to exact for the quartic fpu potential  @xcite .",
    "the fate of the excitation as the entire system relaxes clarifies the roles of the different spectral components in the relaxation process .",
    "the excitation amplitude is sufficiently large ( @xmath70 ) to insure clear presence above the thermal background .    in the previous section we introduced the notion of localized modes as an important component in the thermal relaxation process of the fpu systems .",
    "we explicitly differentiated between _ mobile _ and _ stationary _ localized modes , and noted that energy loss occurs when a localized mode moves and collides with other localized modes .",
    "we also stated that this energy loss occurs through degradation into lower - frequency modes . in order to focus on this mechanism without additional interference from the ends of the chain other than the normal low - frequency decay processes discussed earlier , in this section we use relatively long chains , @xmath71 .",
    "this is sufficiently long that we never see a high - energy localized mode reaching a boundary site before it has degraded or stopped moving .",

    "however , as the thermal excitations are swept out of the system through the harmonic channel , the breather stops moving and survives for a very long time , thus confirming the relaxation picture .",
    "associated with this description is a mean squared displacement that at first goes as @xmath89 but then becomes independent of time .    from a broader perspective",
    ", we have shown that vibrational energy localization and persistence is aided by the presence of an efficient mechanism to remove other background excitations that might perturb and/or destroy localization . in our specific model ,",
    "localization is due to hard anharmonic interactions and the removal mechanism involves a harmonic phonon channel , but one can envision other localization and background sweeping processes that lead to a similar outcome . from a narrower perspective , there are a number of questions that remain to be explored , including relaxation in higher dimensions and the incorporation of more realistic potentials .",
