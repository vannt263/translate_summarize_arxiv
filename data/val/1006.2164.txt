    "poor phase tracking affected the observations of april 03 and 04 , 2008 , thus the astrometry of the merlin observations discussed in this paper comes from the phase referenced observations of april 20 , 2008 . to increase signal to noise",
    ", we combined all merlin data and used the position of the brightest ch@xmath3oh maser from the 2008 april 20 observations as initial model for self - calibration .",

    "we detected five new flare events and discovered periodicity ( see figure  1 ) ; iras@xmath018566 + 0408 is the only ( quasi)periodic h@xmath2co maser system known .",
    "the flares have a periodicity of @xmath1237 days , a duration ( at half - maximum ) of @xmath130 days , and an order of magnitude increase in flux density .",
    "the peak flare intensity and maser intensity during the quiescent state show a monotonic decay ( figure  1 ) .",
    "possible causes of the decay include changes in maser pumping and gas motions affecting beaming .",
    "the flares are not strictly periodic .",
    "the period derived from the december 2006 and november 2008 flares is 238@xmath204 days , and the period derived from the december 2006 and march 2008 flares is 234@xmath201 days .",
    "the flare of august 2009 was well - sampled during the rising part of the flare , but we do not have a good determination of its peak . assuming that the measurement of august 15 , 2009 corresponds to the maximum of the flare ,",
    "then the period would be 244@xmath204 days .",
    "if the 2002 flare were part of a periodic cycle of outbursts , then the period would be 248@xmath205 days ( the uncertainties are 3@xmath21 errors from autocorrelation analysis ) .",
    "most of the recent flares have a shorter period than the one estimated from the data prior to 2007 .",
    "the combined effect of ( quasi)periodic flares , monotonic flux density decay , and tendency toward decreasing period as a function of time are exemplified by the dotted - line in figure  1 .",
    "the dotted - line was generated as follows : 1 ) the light - curve from may 2006 to january 2007 was used as a template ; 2 ) the template was extrapolated assuming an exponential decrease in the interval between consecutive flare peaks ( @xmath22days , where @xmath23 for the interval between the december 2006 and august 2007 flares , @xmath24 for the interval between the august 2007 and march 2008 flares , etc . ) , and an exponential decay in the maser flux density ( @xmath25mjy , where @xmath26 is the julian date of the december 2006 flare peak ) .",
    "this simple extrapolation ( representative fit ) based on the 2006  2007 observations roughly reproduces the peak date and variability profile of the flares , as well as the flux density measurements between 2003 and 2005 .",
    "the flare of august 2009 shows that the period is neither constant nor strictly monotonically decreasing .",
    "nevertheless , the occurrence of the flares has been regular enough to successfully predict the approximate date of the 2008 and 2009 flares to schedule observations .",
    "indeed , the merlin observations were scheduled to coincide with the predicted flare of april 2008 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we also monitored the 6.7@xmath0ghz ch@xmath3oh transition with arecibo .",
    "the 6.7@xmath0ghz ch@xmath3oh spectrum shows a group of nine maser components spread between 78 and 88@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath13 .",
    "figure  2 shows the h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh spectra obtained on december 14 , 2006 , and the light curve of the h@xmath2co maser and three ch@xmath3oh maser components .",
    "we discovered that the ch@xmath3oh maser component at 87.8@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath13 ( hereafter component 9 ) shows flares that are similar to the h@xmath2co maser flares . specifically , the peaks of all ch@xmath3oh ( component 9 ) flares were simultaneous ( within 10 days ) to the peaks of the h@xmath2co flares.oh measurements separated by 14@xmath0days gave the same flux density within 3@xmath21 , which implies an uncertainly on the peak flare of @xmath114 days . ]",
    "iras@xmath018566 + 0408 is thus the first system where ( quasi)periodic correlated maser flares of ch@xmath3oh _ and _ h@xmath2co molecules have been detected , and one of only a few ch@xmath3oh periodic flare systems known ( e.g. , goedhart et al .",
    "2004 , 2009 ) .",
    "the other ch@xmath3oh maser components also show variability but not as well - correlated to the h@xmath2co maser ( see for example figure  2 , bottom panel ) .",
    "we discuss briefly the implications of the variability of the other ch@xmath3oh masers in @xmath274 , but an in - depth discussion of the variability of all ch@xmath3oh masers is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the velocities of the ch@xmath3oh maser component 9 and the h@xmath2co maser ( figure  2 , insets ) differ by 8.3@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath13 , and the masers are separated by @xmath12000@xmath0au ( 12 light - days , 0.32 ) in projection ( figure  3 ) . given that the two masers showed simultaneous flares ,",
    "the origin of the flares is not located in either one of the maser regions , otherwise one component would have always flared before the other .",
    "the different variability behavior of the different ch@xmath3oh components shows that the flares are not caused by an homogeneous and large - scale change in the background radio continuum , e.g. , in the flare of 2006 , the ch@xmath3oh component 3 did not show a flare even though it is located in between h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh masers that showed a flare ( compare the position of the masers shown in figure  3 with the light curves of figure  2 ) .",
    "we therefore find unlikely that the flares are caused by a change in the background radio continuum .",
    "it is also unlikely that the flares are triggered by a propagating sound / density wave or shock front .",
    "for example , assuming that the ch@xmath3oh component 9 and h@xmath2co masers are located at the same distance from the source that triggers the variability ( explaining simultaneous flares ) , then the minimum distance between the driving source and the masers is @xmath28au ( i.e. , masers and driving source located in the plane of the sky ; see figure  3 ) .",
    "this minimum distance implies that the travel time of a 10@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath13 wave from its origin to the maser regions is @xmath29yr , which is far greater than the time scale of the flares ( i.e. , @xmath130 days flare duration , @xmath1237 days periodicity ) .",
    "faster ( j-)shocks ( 100@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath13 and greater ) are unlikely because the molecules would disassociate with the passing of a single shock front ( e.g. , hollenbach & mckee 1989 , garay et al .",
    "2002 ) , instead of showing periodic variability .",
    "the absence of significant changes in line peak velocity and linewidth , as well as the smooth decay of the maser emission during the quiescent phase argue against the j - shock hypothesis .",
    "in contrast , a radiative origin of the flares appears more likely .",
    "if the two maser regions are in the plane of the sky with the source of pumping radiation between them ( assumed hereafter to be the massive protostar or its surroundings ) , then the radiation front would take only about 6 days to reach the maser regions .",
    "this travel time provides a better match to the time scales of the flares .",
    "in addition , changes in maser gain due to variability of the radiation field are consistent with the excitation mechanism of class ii ch@xmath3oh masers ( i.e. , infrared pumping , cragg et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "given that the ch@xmath3oh and h@xmath2co masers show correlated variability , the excitation mechanism of the two maser species must be similar .",
    "the excitation mechanism of h@xmath2co masers has been a controversial topic ( araya et al .",
    "2006 , 2007c ; hoffman et al .",
    "2003 ) ; our discovery of correlated h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh masers shows that the excitation mechanism of h@xmath2co masers is probably infrared pumping .",
    "the periodic behavior of the flares could be caused by a variety of astrophysical processes ; chief among these are stellar pulsations and binary induced variability .",
    "some types of pulsating variable stars have periods of hundreds of days ( e.g. , eyer et al . 2008 ) . nevertheless , the light curves of such pulsating stars are significantly different from the flare - like periodic variability of the h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh masers . pulsations of massive protostars ( and/or inner accretion disks ) can not be ruled out until detailed numerical modeling is conducted",
    ".    an alternative possibility appears more likely : variability modulated by a binary system .",
    "binarity and multiplicity are ubiquitous characteristics of massive stars on both theoretical and observational grounds ( e.g. , krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ; kraus et al .",
    "the orbital periods of visual and spectroscopic massive binaries range between a few days to many years ( e.g. , zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) , encompassing the time scale of the periodic maser flares in iras@xmath018566 + 0408 . in addition , the observed misalignment between an ionized jet , a _",
    "irac 4.5@xmath4 m excess , and a sio outflow could be caused by precession due to a binary system ( araya et al .",
    "2007c , zhang et al . 2007 )",
    ".    recently , van der walt et al . (",
    "2009 ) proposed that the ch@xmath3oh flares in g9.62 + 0.20e ( which have a periodicity very similar to the h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh flares in iras@xmath018566 + 0408 ) are modulated by variability from a colliding wind binary , responsible for a change in the background radio continuum and/or pumping radiation .",
    "even though such a colliding wind model reproduces the variability of the ch@xmath3oh maser flares in g9.62 + 0.20e , we consider the model unlikely in the case of iras@xmath018566 + 0408 .",
    "the h@xmath2co flares are not strictly periodic ( figure  1 ) , thus , an additional , stochiastic mechanism is implicated .",
    "minor local turbulence could superimpose irregularities on the response to a periodic cause but does not explain the combination of decay and irregularity .    here",
    "we propose an alternative scenario for the maser flares in iras@xmath018566 + 0408 : periodic accretion of circumbinary disk material .",
    "this process has been predicted and has observational evidence in the case of some young , low mass binaries ( artymowicz & lubow 1996 ; jensen et al .",
    "2007 ; gnther & kley 2002 ; mundt et al . 2010 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "material from the circumbinary disk is accreted onto the protostars or accretion disks , heating the dust and increasing the infrared radiation field , resulting in higher microwave amplification due to greater maser gain . for example , the smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations by artymowicz & lubow ( 1996 ) show that a binary system with mass ratio 0.79 and eccentricity @xmath30 , will experience bursts of accretion onto the binary components with a dimensionless time - dependence that is quite similar to the h@xmath2co light - curve . in a binary with mass ratio @xmath10.8 ( e.g. ,",
    "a 20 and 16binary ) and @xmath30 , a periodicity of @xmath1240@xmath0days is expected if the semimajor axis of the most massive component is @xmath11.1 au . the short flare events traced by h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh masers in iras@xmath018566 + 0408 ( this work ) and ch@xmath3oh masers in g9.62 + 0.20e",
    "( goedhart et al . 2004 ) could be caused by an orbital configuration similar to the one discussed above .",
    "less flare - like ( more undulated and/or aperiodic ) variability seen in other ch@xmath3oh maser sources ( goedhart et al .",
    "2004 ) would be expected from binary systems with lower eccentricities ( see artymowicz & lubow 1996 ) .",
    "this is , the model of artymowicz & lubow ( 1996 ) could explain not only the time scale for the periodicity , but also the duration of the flaring events , depending essentially on the eccentricity of the binary system .",
    "thus , periodic maser flares could trace the properties of young massive binaries that are actively accreting .",
    "moreover , accretion of circumbinary material may cause mass equalization in massive binaries .",
    "for example , in the model of artymowicz & lubow ( 1996 ) , the lower mass component of the binary is the one with a higher accretion rate ( see however gnther & kley 2002 ) .",
    "we detected the first ( quasi)periodic h@xmath2co maser flare system .",
    "the maser is coincident with a massive protostellar candidate ( iras@xmath018566 + 0408 ) .",
    "the periodicity of the flares is approximately 237@xmath0days .",
    "we also detected 6.7@xmath0ghz ch@xmath3oh flares that are correlated to the h@xmath2co outbursts . regardless of whether the h@xmath2co maser flares reported in this work",
    "unveil tight massive binaries still undergoing accretion or some other process , our discovery shows that short time - scale changes ( weeks to months ) in physical conditions surrounding massive protostars are not random , but that underlying ( semi)harmonic mechanisms are at work during the process of massive star formation .",

    "<S> we report results of an extensive observational campaign of the 6@xmath0 cm formaldehyde maser in the young massive stellar object iras@xmath018566 + 0408 ( g37.55 + 0.20 ) conducted from 2002 to 2009 . using arecibo , vla , and gbt </S>",
    "<S> , we discovered quasi - periodic formaldehyde flares ( p @xmath1 237 days ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on arecibo observations , we also discovered correlated variability between formaldehyde ( h@xmath2co ) and methanol ( ch@xmath3oh ) masers . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath2co and ch@xmath3oh masers are not spatially coincident , as demonstrated by different line velocities and high angular resolution merlin observations . </S>",
    "<S> the flares could be caused by variations in the infrared radiation field , possibly modulated by periodic accretion onto a young binary system . </S>"
