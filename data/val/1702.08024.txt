    "the primary motivation for the studies includes multimessenger astronomy .",
    "photons work as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between various models of the origin of energetic cosmic rays and neutrinos .",
    "in particular , because of the pair production on cosmic background radiation , the photon flux from extragalactic sources is strongly suppressed at sub - pev to sub - eev energies , and non - observation of gamma rays in this energy band would strongly favor the extragalactic origin of icecube - detected astrophysical neutrinos over the galactic models @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "non - observation of cosmogenic photons @xcite would strongly constrain models with proton composition of cosmic rays with @xmath4  ev , see e.g.  refs .",

    "the main problem in the photon search is to separate gamma - ray induced events from the usual , hadron - induced air showers .",
    "one of the best discriminating variables is the muon number of a eas , which is much lower in photon - induced events , compared to the bulk of showers .",
    "indeed , a photon - induced shower develops by means of electromagnetic interactions mostly , and the only source of muons is provided by photonuclear reactions , which have a relatively small cross section .",
    "contrary , in a hadron - induced shower , lots of muons are produced in decays of @xmath5 mesons , born in hadronic interactions .",
    "unfortunately , muon detectors are small or missing in many modern cosmic - ray experiments . here",
    ", we take advantage of having a large muon detector in the eas - msu experiment and use its data to search for air showers poor in muons .    previous preliminary studies indicated some excess of gamma - ray candidates in the eas - msu data with respect to the expected background  @xcite .",
    "these results invited for a detailed study of the data with state of art methods .",
    "this study has been performed : a full monte - carlo model of the data and the detector was constructed  @xcite which gives an excellent description of the surface - detector results  @xcite as well as of the bulk of muon - detector data  @xcite . here , we present the ultimate results of this study and consider muonless photon - candidate events .",
    "we will see that , within the present approach , no excess of these photon - like events is seen in the data .",
    "this allows us to put upper limits on the primary gamma - ray flux which are world - best at energies @xmath6  ev .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , we briefly describe the installation , the data and the monte - carlo simulations used in this work ; references to more detailed descriptions are given .",

    "the eas - msu experiment and the monte - carlo model are described in detail in the previous papers @xcite .",
    "the installation consists of 76 charged - particle detector stations , in which multiple geiger - mueller counters are located which determine the number of charged particles ( @xmath7 ) in a shower .",
    "the total number of geiger - mueller counters in the surface part of the installation is about 10,000 .",
    "the total area of all geiger - mueller counters is @xmath8  m@xmath9 ; the total area of the installation is @xmath10  km@xmath9 . in this work",
    ", we use the data of the large muon detector located at the center of the array at a depth of 40 meters of water equivalent underground corresponding to the threshold energy of 10  gev for vertical muons .",
    "the muon detector had the total area of 36.4  m@xmath11 and consisted of geiger - mueller counters with area of 0.033  m@xmath9 each .",
    "for the present study , we select events with the following cuts :    * the event passes the reconstruction procedure and the reconstruction quality criteria are satisfied @xcite ; * the age parameter of the eas is in the range @xmath12 ; * the reconstructed zenith angle @xmath13 is below @xmath14 ; * the distance between the reconstructed shower axis and the array center where the muon detector is located is @xmath15  m ; * the reconstructed shower size is @xmath16 ; * out of 32 sections of the muon detector , at least 28 were operational .    the only difference with the cuts used in ref .",
    "@xcite is the lower @xmath7 threshold which is chosen to cover a wider range of energies of potential photons .",
    "the extension of the @xmath7 range requires a new comparison of data to monte - carlo to validate the simulations .",
    "the corresponding distributions of @xmath7 , shower age @xmath17 , core distance of the array center @xmath18 , zenith angle @xmath13 and muon density at 100 meters @xmath19 are shown in appendix . with the account of the muon detector operation cut ,",
    "we are left with 1204 days of data taking within 19841990 .",
    "the data set contains 3148 events .    following the previous studies , we consider the following criteria to select photon - candidate events : the muon detector is not triggered by the shower .",
    "however , low - energy protons do not always produce a sufficient number of muons in eas to activate the muon detector , in particular , at large distances between the detector and the shower axis . to evaluate the background of muonless events from hadronic primaries , we make use of the full monte - carlo ( mc ) model of the eas - msu array described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it includes simulations of artificial air showers by the corsika 7.4001 @xcite package with the qgsjet - ii-04 @xcite high - energy hadronic interaction model , fluka 2011.2c @xcite low - energy hadronic interaction model and egs4 @xcite electromagnetic model .",
    "artificial eas are recorded and processed identically to the experimental data .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations have been performed for proton and iron primaries , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ; a realistic composition was assumed to be a mixture of the two .",
    "the muon component of eas is highly dependent on the primary composition , therefore the number of muonless background events depends on the assumed proton fraction . for this study , the primary composition has been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting the observed distribution of the muon densities",
    ". the assumed fraction of protons is @xmath20 .",
    "we note that , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it agrees well with the composition obtained from the eas - msu surface - detector data  @xcite .",
    "more details on the mc set with hadronic primaries may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also need a mc simulation with gamma - ray primaries which is used to determine the efficiency of the installation for the gamma - ray detection , to relate the reconstructed @xmath7 to the primary - photon energy @xmath21 and to account for the amount of photon showers which do not produce photon - candidate ( that is , muonless ) events . the simulation and reconstruction of the artificial photon showers",
    "was performed in a way similar to that for hadron - induced events  @xcite .",
    "the total number of simulated independent gamma - induced showers is 300 , their thrown energies follow the @xmath22 spectrum with lower bound of mc @xmath23  ev , and they are selected at the reconstruction stage to reproduce the primary spectrum @xmath24 , as is customary in high - energy photon searches . the dependence of the resulting limits on the assumed spectrum is through the efficiency only and is weak .",

    "the total number of muonless events in the set is 86 , while the expected number of background muonless events from primary hadrons is 80.1 .",

    "we consider certain subsamples of the data .",
    "the quantity reconstructed for each shower is @xmath7 , not the primary energy @xmath25 ; the relation between the two quantities may be obtained from simulations .",
    "the @xmath26 relations are different for photons and for hadrons , and it is important to keep track of this difference for gamma - ray searches , see e.g.  refs .",

    "the condition used to select the data for the search of photons with @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 where the coefficient @xmath30 was chosen in such a way that at least 90% of mc photon - induced showers with @xmath31 are reconstructed with these @xmath7 .    for each energy cut @xmath32 , we determine the number of observed muonless events , @xmath33 , in the sample , as well as the expected number of muonless events from the background of hadron - induced showers , @xmath34 .",
    "no excess of muonless events is seen , and we estimate the maximum number of photon - induced events in the sample , @xmath35 , by means of the standard feldman ",

    "the upper limits on the photon flux are then estimated as a ratio of @xmath35 and the effective exposure of the experiment to photons of the given energy range .",
    "the effective exposure accounts for the fraction of photon events lost in the reconstruction and , also , of reconstructed photon events which are not muonless .",
    "we estimate the effective exposure as follows .",
    "the geometrical exposure for the conditions we use ( @xmath36  m , @xmath37 ) is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the solid angle , @xmath40 is the area and @xmath41 hours is the on - time of the installation corresponding to the data set used .",
    "note that the @xmath18 cut is defined in the plane orthogonal to the shower axis and therefore @xmath42 is calculated differently from the conventional case when exposure is determined by the area of the array .",
    "mc photon - induced showers are thrown in a square with area @xmath43  km@xmath11 and with zenith angles up to @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding mc geometrical exposure is then @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we calculate the number @xmath48 of events from the mc set which passed all cuts ( that is , in particular , were reconstructed with geometrical properties corresponding to @xmath49 ) , satisfy the criterion  ( [ eq : * * ] ) and are muonless and divide it by the number @xmath50 of thrown mc events ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) .",
    "the effective exposure is then given by @xmath52 the flux limit is then obtained as @xmath53 where @xmath35 corresponds to the required confidence level .",
    "next , we define the exposure correction as a ratio of the effective exposure to geometrical one : @xmath54    note that the exposure correction factor may exceed unity because monte - carlo events are thrown to the area larger than the installation .",

    "presents the exposure correction factor @xmath55 as a function of energy . for comparison , the reconstruction efficiency for primary photons and protons is also shown ( it is determined in a similar way as @xmath55 but without the muonlessness condition and with the criterion @xmath16 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : * * ] ) ) .",
    "decline of @xmath55 at higher energies reflects the fact that the probability for a primary photon to produce a eas which is not muonless grows with energy .",
    "our limits on the integral gamma - ray flux , which represent the main result of this work , are presented in table  [ tab : flux ] .    .",
    "[ tab : flux ] upper limits on the integral diffuse gamma - ray flux @xmath56 at photon energies @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : * * ] ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the number of observed muonless events with @xmath58 ; @xmath34 is the expected number of background muonless events ; @xmath35 is the statistical upper limit on the excess of muonless events over the background ; @xmath59 is the effective exposure for photons . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are reported for two confidence levels , 90% and 95% , as indicated . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         a careful look at the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath33 reveals one peculiarity which is most probably related to the modelling of hadronic interactions but , in principle , might also be explained in terms of the presence of a certain amount of primary photons .",
    "the ratio @xmath62 remains constant , @xmath63 , for energies @xmath64  ev , but quickly raises to @xmath65 below this energy . if , due to some systematics in the modelling of the background , the real @xmath34 is indeed @xmath63 of the mc one , then we have a certain excess of muonless events at @xmath66  ev@xmath67  ev , which may correspond to an excess of primary photons expected , for instance , in the heavy dark - matter decay scenario .",
    "previous analyses of the eas - msu data in the same energy range suggested an excess of muonless events which might be explained by the presence of a certain amount of photons in the primary cosmic - ray flux at @xmath68  ev @xcite .",
    "the present study does not confirm that claim and puts strong upper limits on the gamma - ray flux , see table  [ tab : flux ] .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the differences between this analysis and the previous ones .    with respect to the previous preliminary analysis",
    ", this final study has several important advantages .",
    "first , it is based on the new full monte - carlo description of the air showers and of the installation  @xcite .",
    "this uses modern simulation tools and an analysis technique with the real and simulated events processed by one and the same reconstruction program .",
    "in such a way , we take into account all possible biases introduced at the reconstruction step , as well as keep track of rare fluctuations in the eas development and registration .",
    "second , the reconstruction program has been slightly revised for this study . the main overall effect of the reconstruction update",
    "is that , while the muonless events remain in the data sample , their reconstructed energies become , for most of them , lower than before . for these lower energies ,",
    "the background of muonless hadron - induced showers is higher , and the same amount of muonless events does no longer represent an excess .",
    "third , an additional check of the quality of muon data was performed : at least 28 out of 32 sections of the muon detector are required to be operational .    to be specific , let us consider 48 muonless events with @xmath69 studied in ref",
    ".  @xcite . of them ,",
    "28 events have @xmath70 in the new analysis ; 4 events arrived before 1984 ( not included in the present data set ) ; 10 events arrived at the days excluded from the present analysis because of stricter criteria on the quality of muon data ; 6 muonless events remained in the data set .",
    "in addition , 3 new muonless events joined the data set in the new reconstruction ( they did not pass the cuts in the old one ) , so the total number of muonless events with @xmath71 is now 9 .",
    "this reduced number of photon candidates is below the mc background expectation of 18.9 events , so no excess is present in the updated data set .",
    "our new results are compared to previous studies in fig.[fig : old - vs - new ] .",
    "finally , the efficiency of the muonless detection of photons is estimated in the present work with the full photon monte - carlo .",
    "the numerical values of limits became apparently weaker due to account of the fact that only about 40% of the photon - induced showers are registered as muonless .",
    "many experiments searched for primary photons with the eas technique and none has yet found any .",
    "our flux limits are compared to others in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_limits ] .",
    "ev are 90% cl , all limits above @xmath72  ev are 95% cl . ]",
    "we see that our limits are similar to those of the kascade - grande experiment , being world - best for certain energies . at the same time",
    ", one can see that the energy range @xmath73  ev discussed here is one of the least studied bands .",
    "while future studies to improve the limits are important , already the present data may be used to constrain astrophysical models with galactic sources of pev neutrinos @xcite or decaying dark matter with appropriate mass and sufficiently hard spectrum ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this work presents the results of the search for primary photons in the eas - msu data .",
    "the photon candidate events are defined as ones giving no signal in the muon detector of the installation .",
    "we made use of the full monte - carlo simulation of the installation and of the updated reconstruction of eas parameters .",
    "contrary to the previous analysis of the same data , no evidence was found for an excess of photon - candidate events , and this fact allowed us to put upper limits on the diffuse flux of primary gamma rays at energies above @xmath74  ev . for certain energies ,",
    "the limits are world - best ones .",
    "the difference with the previous study is , mainly , due to the change of reconstruction : the energies of muonless events moved downwards , while the background of muonless showers from primary hadrons is higher at lower energies .",
    "the limits obtained in this work may be used in multimessenger astrophysics as well as for constraining exotic particle - physics models .",
