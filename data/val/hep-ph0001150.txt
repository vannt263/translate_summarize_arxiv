    "although at very low energy the chiral perturbative theory(chpt)@xcite provides an excellent description on interaction of pseudoscalar mesons as well as perturbative qcd works in high energy , it has to be recognized that , so far , we only have a little knowledges concerning underlying dynamical detail at low energy . in particular , in energy region between chpt(@xmath4mev ) and chiral symmetry spontaneously broken(cssb )",
    "scale(@xmath5gev ) , we do not know how to perform rigorous calculation based on underlying dynamics or symmetry at all , since those well - defined qcd expansion(@xmath6 expansion , low energy expansion , etc . ) converge slowly or even diverge here .",
    "therefore , some phenomenological models(e.g .",
    ", hidden local symmetry model@xcite , antisymmetry tensor model@xcite , wccwz model@xcite ) are constructed for capturing the physics in this energy region .",
    "all of these models base on chiral symmetry and only include the lowest order coupling between vector meson resonances and pseudoscalar mesons , i.e. , all couplings are momentum - independent and those coupling constants are determined by experiment instead of underlying dynamics .",
    "it is obvious that these models only provide very rough physical picture on the lowest vector meson resonances . in general ,",
    "if a well - defined effective field theory indeed exists at this energy scale , all couplings should be momentum - dependent instead of constants , or these couplings can yield convergence momentum expansion .",
    "since vector meson masses are much larger than pseudoscalar mesons , it is different from chpt that high order correction of the chiral expansion plays important role here .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a possible method to systematically study the chiral expansion at @xmath1-mass scale .",
    "another fact inspires us to perform this research that the energy scale of cssb is larger than masses of the lowest vector meson resonances .",
    "therefore , if the chiral expansion is in powers of @xmath7 , it converges slowly . obviously , in this case contribution from high order terms of momentum expansion plays an important role",
    ". however , since we do not know how to derive a low energy effective field theory from qcd directly , we have to construct the low energy effective theory in terms of some approaches with features of low energy qcd . in general , there are two different approaches for studying dynamics of light - flavor @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons in framework of effective field theory : one is the method of chpt , which only needs to assume a certain realization of chiral symmetry for vector mesons(it is standard for symmetry realization of pseudoscalar mesons ) . the effective lagrangian is written based on these symmetrical reqiurement and is expanded in powers of external momentum .",
    "the hidden local symmetry model et .",
    "al.@xcite belong to this approach .",
    "a recent review is in@xcite . in principle , this method can be treated as approximate symmetry pattern of qcd and it s symmetry spontaneously breaking if symmetrical realization of vector mesons is right .",
    "unfortunately , the method of chpt is impractical here since our calculation in this paper must go beyond the lowest order , and number of free parameters will increase very rapidly .",
    "another approach is method of chiral quark model(chqm ) .",
    "the manohar - georgi(mg ) model@xcite and extend nambu - jona - lasinio(enjl)@xcite model et .",
    "all belong to this approach . in chiral quark model",
    ", the vector meson fields are coupling to quark fields .",
    "there are no kinetic terms for vector mesons .",
    "therefore they are treated as composited fields of quarks instead of independent degrees of freedom .",
    "effective lagrangian describing dynamics of vector mesons is yielded via quark loop effects .",
    "the chqm approach has some advantages which are try to reflect some underlying dynamical constrains and provide elegant description on some features of low - energy qcd .",
    "the main advantage is that number of free parameters does not increase with expansion order rising . so that it is possible to investigate high order correction of momentum expansion systematically",
    "of course , the chqm approach is only treated as model instead of rigorous theory , since due to lack of knowledge on qcd low energy behavior , one has to add quark - meson coupling or more undelying four fermion coupling handly according to requirement of symmetry .",
    "although this is a disadvantage of the chqm approach , the chqm and its extension@xcite-@xcite have been studied continually during the last two decades and got great successes in different aspects of phenomenological predictions in hadron physics . in this paper , following spirit shown in mg model , we will construct the chiral constituent quark model(chcqm ) for the lowest vector meson resonances , and provide systematic investigation on dynamics of on - shell @xmath2 and @xmath10 decays .",
    "the simplest version of chqm which was originated by weinberg@xcite , and developed by manohar and georgi@xcite provides a qcd - inspired description on the simple constituent quark model . in view of this model , in the energy region between the cssb scale and the confinement scale ( @xmath11 ) , the dynamical field degrees of freedom are constituent quarks(quasi - particle of quarks ) , gluons and goldstone bosons associated with cssb(it is well - known that these goldstone bosons correspond to lowest pseudoscalar octet ) . in this quasiparticle description ,",
    "the effective coupling between gluon and quarks is small and the important interaction is the coupling between quarks and goldstone bosons .",
    "simultaneously , this simple model provide a very rough configuration about baryons , which is baryons can be treated as bound states of three constituent quarks .",
    "thus , from baryon masses , masses of constituent quarks are approximately estimated as 360mev for u , d flavor and 540mev for s flavor@xcite .",
    "we notice that the masses for u , d flavor are very close to @xmath12 . in addition , the binding energy of nucleons is expected to be large due to stability of nucleons .",
    "it implies that true masses of constituent quarks are larger than our above estimation even @xmath12 .",
    "naturally , it is allowed to treat the lowest vector meson resonances as composite fields of constituent quark and antiquarks instead of independent dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "thus , dynamics of vector mesons will be generated by constituent quark loops .",
    "this approach is foundation of our study in this paper .",
    "furthermore , we must point out that , role of pseudoscalar meson fields in constituent quark model is different from other two kinds of chqm : enjl model and chiral current quark model@xcite . in the latter",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons are composited fields of current quark and antiquarks . so that they are not independent dynamical field degree of freedom of these models and dynamics of @xmath8 mesons is generated by current quark loops .",
    "however , in the former the pseudoscalar mesons are independent dynamics degree of freedom instead of bound states of constituent quarks .",
    "this implies that the model is `` part renormalizatable''(for kinetic term of @xmath8 mesons ) .",
    "there is no so called double counting problem in this model due to the following two reasons : 1 ) the constituent quark fields and pseudoscalar mesons(as goldstone bosons ) are generated simultaneously by cssb .",
    "2 ) phenomenologically , the masses of constituent quarks are much larger than of @xmath8 mesons . therefore ,",
    "if pseudoscalar fields are bound states of constituent quarks , such large binding energy is anti - intuitive .",
    "although enjl model or chiral current model provide a possibility to probe underly dynamics structure on pseudoscalar mesons , they are failed to touch the goal of this paper , since these models can not yield a sufficient large paramter consistently to make the chiral expansion at energy scale @xmath13 be convergent .",
    "it has been known that , there are some rather different forms on low energy effective lagrangian including spin-1 meson resonances , and the different types of couplings contained in them .",
    "every approach corresponds to a different chioce of fields for the spin-1 mesons , and they are in principle equivalent . from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry only , an alternative scheme for incorporating spin-1 mesons was suggested by weinberg@xcite and developed further by callan , coleman et .",
    "in this treatment , all spin-1 meson resonances transform homogeneously under a non - linear realizations of chiral @xmath14 , which are uniquely determined by the known transformation properties under the vectorial subgroup @xmath15(octets and singlet ) .",
    "this is an attractive symmetry property on meson resonances and quite nature in chcqm , since in this model all dynamical field degree of freedom are associated with cssb so that lagrangian is explicitly invariant under local @xmath15 transformation .",
    "of course , it is not necessary to describe the degrees of freedom of vector and axial - vector mesons by antisymmetric tensor fields@xcite , and there are other phenomenological successful attempts to introduce spin-1 meson resonances as massive yang - mills fields@xcite .",
    "we will show that , in chcqm , vector representation for vector mesons is nature and more convenient than tensor representation .    in past thirties years , various approachs have been attempted to predict hadron phenomenology .",
    "many of these approachs on vector mesons are motivated by phenomenologically successful ideas of vector - meson dominance(vmd ) and universal coupling@xcite . in chcqm , we only need start from bound states approachs for vector meson resonances and transformation properties of their vector repsentation .",
    "the vmd and universal coupling will be naturally predicted by the model in stead of input .",
    "consequently , other phenomenological relation , such as ksrf sum rules are yielded too .",
    "this is anthor advantage of chcqm .",
    "it should be noted that , in making comparisons between chcqm and other approachs , we need carefully distinguish features coming from the choice of field from those coming from phenomenological requirments .",
    "the former are not physical , controlling merely the off - shell behaviour of scattering amplitudes .",
    "the later do have physical consequences , such as relations between on - shell amplitudes for different processes .",
    "furthermore , for purpose of this paper , a nature problem appears : can phenomenological results obtained in leading order still be kept when high order of momentum expansion are considered ?",
    "this problem will be carelly study in this paper .",
    "it can be known from chpt , if an effective field theory is constructed in powers of momentum expansion , loop graphs of this field theory which comes from lower order terms will contribute to higher order terms .",
    "a nature agruement is loop graphs of effective field theory of qcd are suppressed by @xmath16 expansion@xcite .",
    "however , for physical value @xmath17 , this suppression is not suficiently small , so that we can not omit contribution from hadron loop graphs in our calculation(especially , one - loop graph ) . due to large mass gap between pseudoscalar mesons and vector meson ,",
    "it is reasonable assumption that dominant contribution comes from one - loop graphs of pseduoscalar meson .",
    "the dynamics including one - loop contribution is very different from one of leading order , for instance , imaginary of @xmath18-matrix of this effective theory will be yielded . naturally , it is very difficult to deal with ultraviolet(uv ) divergence from hadron loops in a framework of non - renormalizable field theory",
    ". fortunately , loop effects of pseudoscalar meson cause @xmath19 mixing which will destory ozi rule if this contribution is large .",
    "thus we can cancel all uv divergence from @xmath8 meson loops in terms of ozi rule .",
    "it is different from some approachs that@xcite , according to proposition of this paper , physics about axial - vector meson resonances , @xmath20(1260 ) , can not be studied here . since the chiral expansion in this energy region is not convergent .",
    "in fact , this problem exists in all approachs including axial - vector meson resonances . of course , from alternative viewpoint",
    ", those approachs can be understood and only be understood as phenomenological models in the leading order . in this paper , since we will provide a rigorous treatment on the chiral expansion , we only focus our attention on vector mesons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the chiral constituent quark model with vector meson resonances are constructed , and the effective lagrangian at leading order are derived .",
    "this effective lagranguan is equivalent to wccwz lagrangian given by brise@xcite . in sect .",
    "3 we will calculate effective vertices for @xmath21 mixing , @xmath2 , @xmath22 and four - pseudoscalar meson coupling . those effective vertices",
    "is generated by constituent quark loops , and include all orders correction of momentum expansion . in sect .",
    "4 , one - loop correction generated by pseudoscalar mesons is calculated systematically .",
    "our goal is to estimate hadronic one - loop contribution in @xmath3 and @xmath2 decay amplitude .",
    "the breit - wigner formula for @xmath1-propagator is obtained .",
    "the unitarity of this effective theory is also examined explicitly .",
    "the numerical result is in sect . 5 and sect .",
    "6 is devoted to summary .",
    "the qcd lagrangian with three flavour current quark fields @xmath23 is , @xmath24 for our purpose we only pay attention to @xmath25 . here the fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28 matrices in flavour space and denote respectively vector , axial - vector and pseudoscalar external fields .",
    "@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is scalar external fields and @xmath31=diag(@xmath32 ) is current quark mass matrix with three flavors .    the introduction of external fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 allows for the global symmetry of the lagrangian to be invariant under local @xmath35 , i.e. , with @xmath36 , the explicit transformations of the different fields are @xmath37    now let energy descend until chiral symmetry is spontanoeusly broken . below this energy scale , the coupling becomes strong and perturbative qcd can no longer be done , so that we need some effective models(quark model , pole model , skyrme model ... ) to approach low energy behaviours of qcd .",
    "a successful attempt is achieved by non - linear realization of spontanoeusly broken global chiral symmetry introduced by weinberg@xcite .",
    "this realization is obtained by specifying the action of global chiral group @xmath38 on element @xmath39 of the coset space @xmath40 : @xmath41 explicit form of @xmath39 is usually taken @xmath42 where the goldstone boson @xmath43 are treated as pseudoscalar meson octet .",

    ". thus axial - vector meson resonances @xmath55 will affect low energy dynamics of pseudoscalar fields through @xmath56 mixing .",

    "for example , from table 2 we can see that the correction of meson - loop is about @xmath156 .",
    "it is agree with @xmath155 expansion for @xmath17 very well . in particular",
    ", we can not understand the unitarity of this model at all if our studies are limited to capture merely the leading order effects of large @xmath157 expansion .    in table 2",
    "we also show how ksrf(i ) sum rule is broken .",
    "we can see that both of high power terms of momentum expansion and meson - loop break ksrf(i ) sum rule .",
    "this mechanism is agree with experiment very well .",
    "the physics on vector meson resonances has been studied continually by various chiral models during the last two decades .",
    "it is well known , however , that all past studies on this sort of chrial models suffer two difficulties : 1 ) the convergence of the chiral expansiom in the models is unclear .",
    "2 ) there is no well - defined way to calculate the next to leading order .",
    "this makes the model s calculations being not controlled approximations in that there is no well - defined way to put error bars on the predictions . in this present paper , we have provided a self - consistent pattern to overcome the difficuties mentioned above , that is the chcqm formalism .",
    "the chiral constituent quark model with vector meson fields is formulated only by two basic ideas : one is transformation properties of relevant fields under su(3)@xmath158 and another one is to treat vector mesons as composited fields of constituent quarks . employing chcqm ,",
    "we have provided a systematical method to investigate the chiral expansion up to all order , and to perform the calculation to the next leading order of @xmath155 expansion .",
    "the results are factorized in @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath101 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 decay of neutron ) , @xmath163 , ksrf(i ) sum rule ) , @xmath164mev , chiral coupling constants at @xmath109 ) and @xmath165 , zweig rule ) .",
    "there are no adjustable parameters in the theoretical calculations presented in this formalism . by using this method ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 decays are calculated .",
    "the predictions are in quite well agreement with the data .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , in chcqm formalism we can derive a self - consistent effective field theory with the lowest vector meson resonances , and the calculation pattern presented in this paper is legitimat .",
    "\\i ) the chiral expansion at this energy scale is convergent .",
    "the convergence of chiral expansion is the most important criterion to examine whether a chiral model including meson resonances can construct a consistent effective field theory . from this point",
    ", many approachs can only be thought of phenomenological models available at the leading order of the chiral expansion , since in those models it is diffcult to yield convergent chiral expansion at vector mesom energy scale .",
    "\\ii ) the chiral expansion at this energy scale converge slowly .",
    "theoretically , it has been shown by agurement in chpt , that the chiral expansion at energy scale @xmath166 should be in powers of @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath13 , complete theoretical predictions have to include high order terms of the chiral expansion , and the method of chpt becomes impratical .",
    "thus in this paper , we studied the chiral expansion in powers of @xmath0 systematically by means of the approach of the chiral constituent quark model .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we can study the chiral expansion up to all orders but without extra free parameters .",
    "although the number of parameters is even less than @xmath136 chpt , this theory s prediction potential is quite powerful .",
    "\\iii ) the large @xmath157 expansion argues that both of width of meson resonances and loop effects of mesons are suppressed@xcite .",
    "for example , in those processes relating to @xmath1-resonance , the contribution from meson loops is about @xmath168 .",
    "this arguement is comfirmed by unitarity of the chiral theory(e.g .",
    "(  [ 4.42 ] ) ) .",
    "thus the loop effects of mesons also play important role in a chiral effective theory . in this paper , we study one - loop effects of pseudoscalar mesons systematically . the logarithmic divergence and quadratic divergence from meson loops are cancelled by @xmath136 coupling constants of chpt and zweig rule respectively .",
    "the contribution from meson loops is about @xmath169 , which agree with large @xmath157 arguement very well .",
    "more important , unitarity of this chiral effective theory is examined explicitly , and the one - loop correction of pseudoscalar mesons make theoretical predition close to experiment .",
    "it shows that calculation on one - loop graphs of mesons is self - consistent .",
    "all of these imply that precise prediction of a chiral meson effective theory must include the contribution from meson loops .",
    "finally , the calculation on @xmath1-meson in this paper can be easily extend to cases including @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the difference is that the strange quark mass play important role in the chiral expansion at @xmath172 or @xmath173-scale .",
    "these studies will be found elsewhere .",
