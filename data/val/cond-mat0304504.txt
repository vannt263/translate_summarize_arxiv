    "gumen _ et al _ @xcite have considered recently the consequences of introducing a topological defect , that is , a defect that breaks the long range order in an otherwise 1d periodic structure .",
    "they analyze the case of two semi - infinite equal lattices that match at a point which is not at the center of the unit cell . as an example , they consider the potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is related to the strength of the defect .",
    "the authors then solve the stationary schrdinger equation , which is mathieu s equation at both sides of the defect , and find that for special values of the defect strength @xmath5 , two levels appear in the forbidden band .",
    "the situation is different from what occurs with a point defect , where typically only one level lies in the energy gaps . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate this effect for the normal - mode frequencies of torsional waves in rods with notches , both numerically and experimentally .",
    ", @xmath6  cm , @xmath7  cm , and @xmath8  cm . in the case of the fourth band",
    "only four frequencies are shown . ]        in this note we deal with torsional vibrations of the elastic rod shown in fig .  [ rod ] .",
    "the rods consist of @xmath9 unit cells plus a defective cell , which is the topological defect . with the exception of the defect ,",
    "each cell is formed by three cylinders , one of length @xmath10 with cross section area @xmath1 and two cylinders of length @xmath11 with cross section area @xmath2 . in the defect",
    "the central cylinder has length @xmath12 .",
    "the wavelength is much larger than the radius of the rod , so the system is indeed one dimensional .    using the electromagnetic acoustic transducer ( emat ) for low frequencies that we have recently developed @xcite , we can excite and measure normal - mode frequencies and wave amplitudes for torsional waves in metallic rods .",
    "the experimental apparatus has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite . for locally periodic systems a band structure emerges . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these normal - mode properties can also be computed using the transfer matrix method .",
    "the theoretical results agree very well with our experimental measurements ; we should emphasize that this is a parameter free fit .    in fig .",
    "[ espectro ] we present the band spectrum obtained for @xmath13 , both from the theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "we see that in the gap between the first and second bands only one frequency appears , but in the second forbidden gap two levels lie . in some of the higher gaps",
    "two frequencies are also found .",
    "this is an experimental realization of the theoretical findings of gumen et al @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ waveamplitudes ] we show the wave amplitudes of these two states ; they are localized around the topological defect with an exponential decay .",
    "the theoretical values , both for the frequencies and wave amplitudes coincide well with our measurements , as these two figures show .",
    "the theoretical results are easily extended for wider ranges of @xmath14 .",
    "the band spectrum as a function of @xmath14 is given in fig .",
    "[ chi ] . since the frequencies of the localized states are proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an integer number , more than one level can lie in the forbidden band . for example , as will be seen in fig .",
    "[ chi ] , for @xmath17  cm two levels appear , whereas for higher values of @xmath18 three states are located in the second forbidden band .    .",
    "for @xmath17  cm _ two _ levels lie between the second and third bands . for larger values of @xmath18",
    "_ three _ levels are in the forbidden band . ]",
    "we have measured and calculated numerically normal - mode frequencies and amplitudes of torsional waves in a rod with a topological defect .",
    "the theoretical prediction of gumen _ et al _ @xcite that for certain topological defects two levels instead of one become localized is shown to be true , and an experimental example is provided .",
    "we also give , via a numerical calculation , a generalization of the results found in ref .",
