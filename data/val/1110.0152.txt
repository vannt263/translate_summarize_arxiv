    "the inclusive cross section of any physics process is determined by born - cross section ( @xmath12 ) and the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the inclusive cross section tests calculations based on the higher order perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and also pdfs .",
    "especially , w and z boson processes shown in figure [ fig : wz ] are well understood and unique signature with high rate , which give a useful information of qcd and pdfs .",
    "moreover , these processes are a good tool to calibrate the detector in the early stage and the total cross section of these processes can be used as the luminosity candles at lhc .",
    "w or z process mediates for many complex final states like top or new physics , so the measurement of w and z production process paves the way for understanding top or new physics processes .    in the w production mechanism , it is polarized due to the parity violation at production and it gives a strong asymmetry in the lepton decay .",
    "this asymmetry measurement constrains for the ratio of u and d quark , particulary on the sea quark contribution at lhc .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry measurement of w boson production is important input of the global pdfs fit .    here",
    ", we measure the inclusive cross section and its ratio of w and z production decaying to electrons or muons with the data sample taken from 2010 lhc operation period ( 36 @xmath1 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the cms detector can be found in ref .",
    "the cms detector is a superconducting solenoid , of 13 m in length and 6 m in diameter , which provides an axial magnetic field of 3.8 t. the innermost layer is a silicon tracker which covers the pseudorapidity , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the polar angle of the trajectory of the particle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "outside of the silicon tracker , the scintillating crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and the brass / scintillator hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) follow .",
    "the ecal provide coverage of @xmath16 in the barrel region and @xmath17 in the endcap region .",
    "the muon system is made of three technologies , drift tubes , cathode stript chambers , and resistive plate chambers .",
    "the muon detector covers @xmath18 region and has about 2 @xmath19 transverse momentum resolution in the relevant muon @xmath20 range with the silicon track matching .",
    "the data sample consists of 36 @xmath1 collected by cms detector at lhc during 2010 .",
    "the analysis is performed for the electron and muon channel for w / z production .",
    "the events from the high @xmath21 electron or the single high @xmath20 muon trigger is used to select the sample . in the muon channel ,",
    "the muon is selected to have @xmath22 gev for w boson and @xmath23 gev for z boson in @xmath24 .",
    "the good track quality selection is required to find a good muon and the impact parameter cut , @xmath25 mm , is also required to reduce the cosmic muon background .",
    "the electron is required to have @xmath26 gev for w and z boson in a good detector fiducial region , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the high @xmath21 electron cluster is matched to a high @xmath20 track and also required to pass the electron identification ( i d ) variables like a shower shape and the conversion reject variables .",
    "both electron and muon are required to be the isolated object .",
    "since the w production has large drell - yan background contamination , the drell - yan background is reduced by rejecting the event with the second isolated lepton with loose selection .",
    "the acceptance is calculated using  monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite generator interfaced with  parton showering .",
    "the  generator is combined with a  @xcite simulation of the cms detector .",
    "the acceptance is the event fraction of the event with kinematic selection ( @xmath29 gev for w selection , and @xmath30 gev for z selection in the detector fiducial region ) to the generated events .",
    "the acceptance for the z boson measurement is restricted by the z mass range , @xmath31 gev .",
    "the total acceptance is 50 @xmath19 for w boson and 40 @xmath19 level for z boson .",
    "table [ tab : acp ] summarizes the acceptance for each channel .",
    ".the acceptance ( @xmath32 ) of w or z boson production .

    "in w production , it is hard to measure the asymmetry of w production directly because the momentum of @xmath33 in the longitudinal direction is unknown .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry is measured using the final state lepton , which is the lepton charge asymmetry . the lepton charge asymmetry of w production ( @xmath34 )",
    "is defined as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pseudorapidity of the lepton in the final state .",
    "the lepton charge asymmetry has a strong @xmath36 dependence , so it is important to understand @xmath36 dependence of efficiencies and background . in the measurement ,",
    "the efficiencies ( reconstruction , i d , and trigger ) are estimated as a function of muon @xmath20 and @xmath36 .",
    "the background is also estimated in @xmath36 using the shape fitting method ( @xmath37  fit for the electron channel and the isolation energy fitting for the muon channel ) from the data directly .",
    "for the electroweak background , we use the simulation samples .",
    "all other methods of the measurement are same as used for the inclusive cross section measurement .",
    "the lepton charge asymmetry has @xmath20 dependence , so it is measured in two muon @xmath20 bins , @xmath38 and @xmath39 gev .",
    "the asymmetry is measured in the electron and muon channel , respectively , and shows a good agreement between these two channels .",
    "figure [ fig : asym ] shows the lepton charge asymmetry in @xmath36 and @xmath20 compared to the theory predictions ,  @xcite with cteq10w @xcite and nlo mstw2008 @xcite pdfs .",
    "the precision of the measurement is less than 1.1 @xmath19 for the statistical uncertainty and 1.5 @xmath19 for the total uncertainty in all @xmath36 bins .",
    "this measurement is new input to pdf global fit which constrains to the u and d quark ratio .",
