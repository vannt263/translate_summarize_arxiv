    "recent data on single spin azimuthal asymmetries in sidis obtained by the compass  @xcite , hermes  @xcite and clas at jlab  @xcite collaborations triggered a new interest in tmd dfs and ffs .",
    "the gauge invariant definitions of tmd and factorization theorems for polarized sidis were carefully studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the general expression for the sidis cross - section can be factorized into tmd dfs and ffs and soft and hard parts arising from soft gluon radiation and qcd contributions to hard scattering , respectively .",
    "however , it is difficult to apply the complete formalism of the qcd factorized approach in performing a phenomenological analysis of data or making predictions . the current common practice ( see , for example , the recent analysis of cahn , sivers and collins asymmetries in  @xcite ",
    "@xcite ) is to use the leading order ( lo ) expressions for soft and hard parts which is equivalent to using the simple parton model expression including twist - two tmd dfs and ffs .",
    "this approach allows to capture the main features of considered effects and make predictions for different processes . in our calculations",
    "we will follow the same line .    within this lo",
    "qcd parton model approach the polarized nucleon is described by six time reversal even and two time reversal odd twist - two tmd dfs .",
    "one of these dfs , @xmath5 , describes longitudinal polarization of quarks in the transversely polarized target . as in the case of polarized lepton scattering on",
    "longitudinally polarized target this longitudinal polarization of active quark will lead to double spin ( longitudinally polarized lepton and transversely polarized target nucleon ) asymmetry , @xmath6 .",
    "the rough estimates of this asymmetry has been performed in  @xcite .",
    "the so called lorentz invariance ( li ) relation  @xcite between the first @xmath7-momentum of the twist - two df @xmath5 and the twist - three df @xmath8 was used . in its turn",

    "we will perform a more detailed analysis of this asymmetry based on recent sets of dfs and ffs and using the same li and ww relations as in  @xcite .",
    "it is proven experimentally  @xcite that ww - relation is not strongly violated .",
    "on the other hand recently deeper understanding of description of tmd - dependent df within qcd has been achieved . in particular , it was shown that gauge link entering in the definitions of dfs plays a very important role , for example , it provides the possibility for nonzero sivers effect  @xcite .",
    "then , at first some model calculations and after that the general considerations demonstrated  @xcite that li relations can be violated due to presence of this gauge link in definitions of dfs .",
    "thus , it seems actual to make predictions for @xmath0 using li relation and check them experimentally .",
    "strong deviations from these predictions will indicate strong violation of li relations .",
    "this statement holds true if the validity of lo calculations is proven by , for example , comparing the predictions of these calculations for sidis cross - sections and asymmetries with the data .",
