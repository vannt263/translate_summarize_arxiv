    "radiative @xmath8 decays to @xmath9 are a rich laboratory for the standard model and new physics .",
    "especially , @xmath10 is well understood theoretically via @xmath11 transition as well as experimentally .",
    "recently , higher resonant kaons are observed by cleo and @xmath8 factories @xcite .",
    "for example , belle collaboration has measured the radiative @xmath6 decays for the first time @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the orbitally excited axial vector meson . in the theoretical side , recent developments of the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite makes it possible to calculate the hard spectator contributions systematically in a factorized form through the convolution at the heavy quark limit .",
    "@xmath10 is already studied in this line @xcite .",
    "one good point about @xmath13 is that there are lots of things shared with @xmath10 .",
    "basically both of them are governed by @xmath11 . and the distribution amplitudes ( da ) of @xmath14 and @xmath13 are same except the overall factor of @xmath15 which makes few differences in many calculations .",
    "a straightforward extension of the analysis for @xmath10 to @xmath16 was given in @xcite .",
    "but the belle measurements of eq .",
    "( [ belle ] ) reveal that theory predicts much smaller branching ratio than data @xcite .",
    "this is an opposite situation to that of @xmath10 where theory predicts larger branching ratio . considering the resemblance between @xmath14 and @xmath13 ,",
    "it is quite unlikely that the same theoretical framework would produce discrepancies with experiment in a reversed way .    in the previous analysis",
    "the main uncertainty of theory lies in the nonperturbative form factors . ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) results for the @xmath6 form factors @xcite . in @xcite",
    "only the leading twist das are considered without any non - asymptotic contributions . in this paper",
    "we revisit the @xmath6 form factors in the lcsr .",
    "there are three improvements compared to @xcite .",
    "first , higher twist das are included ; second , non - asymptotic contributions are also considered ; third , terms proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of axial meson , are not neglected .    for @xmath19 form factors ,",
    "the lcsr results are updated @xcite up to the one - loop corrections to twist-2,3 contributions and leading order twist-4 .",
    "it is thus legitimate to improve the theoretical accuracy for @xmath6 form factors .",
    "it is believed that the physical @xmath20 and @xmath21 states are the mixtures of angular momentum eigenstates @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the mixing angle is not known precisely , but is close to the maximal .",
    "this is a very natural and convenient way to explain the suppression of one decay mode compared to the other . for the suggestive angles @xmath24 @xcite ,",
    "negative ones are disfavored by ( [ belle ] ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "some of the gegenbauer moments of @xmath1 das are calculated by lcsr . with this information",
    ", we explicitly calculate the @xmath0 form factor in lcsr",
    ". since @xmath1 and @xmath4 have different g - parity , their gegenbauer expansion will not be the same .",
    "future study on @xmath4 is necessary to reinforce the reliability of current work .",
    "we use the results from model calculations for @xmath4 to give @xmath6 form factors .",
    "this form factor will also be available for nonleptonic decay modes @xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the weak form factors and axial vector meson das are defined .",
    "the lcsr evaluation is given in sec .",
    "section iv deals with the lcsr results . in sec .",
    "v , some discussions about the results and their meanings appear .",

    "also , eq .  ( [ finalsr ] ) contains terms proportional to @xmath17 , but eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) is the result of heavy quark limit .",
    "one can easily expect that the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of @xmath96 corrections to the qcdf framework might include the terms of @xmath97 , but there is no systematics so far .",
    "the hard spectator interactions are given by the convolution of hard kernel and meson das .",
    "similar non - zero @xmath17 terms will also appear in the axial vector das to affect the hard spectator interactions .",

    "secondly , @xmath99 could be larger .",
    "actually there is no clue about the size of @xmath99 , but it might be that @xmath99 is comparable in size to @xmath76 , just as in @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the form factor can be enhanced via mixing @xmath100 for @xmath101 , which results in a large branching ratio , @xmath102    in conclusion , we have calculated @xmath0 form factor in lcsr .",
    "this analysis improves the previous one in a few respects by including higher twist das , non - asymptotic contributions , and non - zero @xmath17 terms .",
    "the value is rather larger than the previous calculation and that from the quark model result .",
    "larger value is well accommodated to the experimental data .",
    "one needs more information about @xmath4 and the mixing angle to reduce theoretical uncertainties . to go beyond the current work",
    ", one can include the nlo of @xmath103 which might not be so different from that for @xmath19 @xcite . and",
