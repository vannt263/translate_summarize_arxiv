    "a dark energy component is probably responsible for the present stage of acceleration of our universe , .",
    "perhaps the most appealing candidate for dark energy is that of a scalar field , quintessence , which can be either a fundamental particle or a composite particle . within the context of field theory and particle physics",
    "it is appealing to interpret the dark energy as some kind of particles that interact with the particles of the standard model very weakly .",
    "the weakness of the interaction is required since dark energy particles have not been produced in the accelerator and because the dark energy has not decayed into lighter ( e.g. massless ) fields such as the photon .",
    "it is common to assume the interaction between the dark energy and all other particles to be via gravity only , however recently interacting dark energy models have been proposed - .",
    "this has been motivated in part by the cosmological observations where an equation of state of dark energy may be smaller than minus , . in general fluids with @xmath3 give many theoretically problems such as stability issues or wrong kinetic terms as phantom fields .",
    "however interacting dark energy - , , where the dark energy interacts not only gravitationally with other fluids , is a very simple and attractive option which may lead an apparent equation of state smaller than -1 .",
    "these fluids can be dark matter , neutrinos or other scalar fields .",
    "we study in this letter the cosmological evolution of the two scalar fields with arbitrary potentials in the presence of a barotropic fluid , which can be matter or radiation .",
    "we show that all models dependence lies on three parameters @xmath4 defined in eq.([lm ] ) .",
    "we determine the dynamical equations and obtain the attractor solutions as a function of these @xmath2 .",
    "we find six different attractor solutions depending on the relative size of @xmath2 and we calculate the relevant cosmological parameters .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sf ] we set up the framework for the cosmological evolution of two scalar fields with an arbitrary potential in the presence of a barotropic fluid . in section [ de ]",
    "we present the conditions on the scalar potential for dark energy . in section [ gda ]",
    "we derive the dynamical first order differential equations and we show that the system is determined by only three parameters . in section [ cs ]",
    "we calculate the critical points and we study the stability of each solution and we give a few examples . in section [ lim ]",
    "we study different asymptotic limits and we present a discussion on specific particle physics motivated examples . finally in section",
    "[ con ] we present our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is a universe filled with two scalar fields @xmath5 and a barotropic energy density @xmath6 , which can be either matter @xmath7 or radiation @xmath8 .",
    "we will assume that the scalar fields interact via a potential @xmath0 while there is only gravitational interaction between these fields and the barotropic fluid .",
    "this work generalizes that of a single scalar field and a barotropic fluid .",
    "one of this scalar fields , namely @xmath9 , may be considered as dark energy ( quintessence ) but it is not necessary to interpret @xmath9 as dark energy and we will work in a completely general framework .",
    "we take the following lagrangian for the scalar fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 l=+- v_t ( , ) with the total potential @xmath0 . instead of working with the total potential @xmath11 we find it useful to separate the contribution of the interacting and non interacting terms to differentiate the contribution of the two scalar fields .",
    "so , without loss of generality , we take the total potential as v_t(,)=v()+b ( , ) with @xmath12 a potential only depending on @xmath9 and the interacting potential @xmath13 is a function of both fields .",
    "of course we could take @xmath14 with @xmath15 to have a more symmetric potential between the fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is more convenient to keep only the two potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the mass of the scalar fields is given by m^2&&= v_+b _ + m^2&&= b_. we can also define the energy density and pressure for the fields @xmath24 as ^2 + v ( ) , p_^2 - v ( ) and that of @xmath10 as _ ^2 + b ( , ) , p_^2 - b ( , ) . using eqs.([rp ] ) and ( [ rvp ] ) we can rewrite the dynamical eqs.([dp ] ) , ( [ dvp ] ) in terms of the energy densities as + 3h(1 + ) & = & -= -b _ + + 3h(1 + ) & = & = b _ + + 3h(1+w_b ) & = & 0where we have included the evolution of the barotropic fluid @xmath6 and b_defines the interaction term .",
    "the equation of state parameters are given by = , = and the time derivative of @xmath25 is h = -(+++p_+p_+p_b ) = -(^2+^2+(1+w_b ) ) .      to obtain an effective equation of state we simply rewrite eqs.([dr ] ) as = -3h(1+w_eff ) , = -3h(1+w_b eff ) with the effective equation of state defined by w_eff + , w_eff w_b- .",
    "we see from eqs.([rw ] ) that @xmath26 give the complete evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for @xmath29",
    "we have @xmath30 and the fluid @xmath27 will dilute faster then without the interaction term ( i.e. @xmath31 ) while @xmath28 will dilute slower since @xmath32 . which fluid dominates at late time will depend on which effective equation of state is smaller . the difference in eqs.([weff ] ) is w_eff-=w - with @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined as = ( ) while the sum gives + = + .",
    "clearly the relevant quantity to determine the relative growth is given by @xmath34 and if @xmath35 we have @xmath36 and @xmath28 will dominate the universe at late times while for @xmath37 we have @xmath38 and @xmath27 will prevail . in the limit of no interaction",
    "@xmath39 we get @xmath40 and @xmath41 if @xmath42 and @xmath27 will dominate at late times .",
    "if @xmath43 then @xmath44 and the ratio of both fluids @xmath45 will approach a constant value .",
    "if the universe is dominated by @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 , then eq.([sw ] ) gives = + ( 1- ) , i.e. the effective equation of state is constraint between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath11 is defined in eq.([vt ] ) and we expect the fields @xmath50 to evolve to the minimum of the potential , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "if we want to interpret @xmath16 as the dark energy potential , no fine tuning of the potential @xmath16 requires that the minimum is at vanishing potential ( i.e. @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 ( see section [ de ] ) , however including the interaction term @xmath17 we can now have @xmath55 for a non vanishing total potential @xmath11 .",

    "taking @xmath55 and the time derivative @xmath57 , where we used eq.([m ] ) , one obtains = -a^-3 with the solution of @xmath58 giving a^-3 .",
    "while the derivative of the effective potential @xmath59 is negative the field @xmath9 evolves to larger values and even in the limit @xmath55 we have with @xmath60 and a positive the interaction term @xmath61 .",
    "the mass @xmath62 given by eq.([m ] ) becomes m^2= v_+b_= b_(1 + ) b_(1 + ) with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 if the field @xmath9 is tracking ) and we have approximated @xmath65 and @xmath66 in then last equality of eq.([mm ] ) , valid if the kinetic energy is small compared to the potential energy .",

    "the slow roll constrains || 1 , 1 must be satisfied at present time . as a result of the dynamics",

    "@xmath76 going to zero or a constant smaller than @xmath77 will the universe accelerate at late times .",
    "the absence of an arbitrary dark energy scale requires the slow roll conditions to be satisfied also in the future and therefore @xmath16 is a runaway potential and tends to zero at @xmath78 . from eqs.([sr ] ) we see that @xmath79 and @xmath80 also approach zero at late times and @xmath79 is therefore negative .",

    "to determine the attractor solutions of the differential equations given in eqs.([dp ] ) and ( [ dvp ] ) or ( [ dr ] ) it is useful to make the following change of variables , x_1 , y_1 + x_2 , y_2 and eqs.([dr ] ) and ( [ dh ] ) become a set of dynamical differential equations of first order x_1n&= & -(3 + ) x_1 + ( y_1 ^ 2 + y_2 ^ 2 ) + x_2n&= & -(3 + ) x_2 + y_2 ^ 2 + y_1n&= & - y_1- x_1 y_1 + y_2n&= & - y_2- ( x_1 + x_2)y_2 + & = & -3 2 ( 2x_1 ^ 2 + 2x_2 ^ 2 + ) where @xmath83 is the logarithm of the scale factor @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and ( n ) - , ( n ) - , ( n ) - . notice that all model dependence in eqs.([cosmo1 ] ) is through the three quantities @xmath90 and the constant parameter @xmath91 .",

    "the set of equations given in eqs.([cosmo1 ] ) give the evolution of two scalar fields @xmath5 with arbitrary potentials in the presence of a barotropic ( perfect ) fluid with equation of state @xmath99 .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sf ] the choice of dividing the total potential @xmath11 into @xmath100 is without loss of generality and it is convenient in order to distinguish the contribution from both scalar fields . if we do not want to consider the contribution from the barotropic fluid we can easily take the limit @xmath101 in eqs.([cosmo1 ] ) since all contribution form @xmath6 is given in @xmath102 via the term @xmath103 .",

    "<S> we study the cosmological evolution of two coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary interaction term @xmath0 in the presence of a barotropic fluid , which can be matter or radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the force between the barotropic fluid and the scalar fields is only gravitational . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dynamics is completely determine by only three parameters @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we determine all critical points and study their stability . </S>",
    "<S> we find six different attractor solutions depending on the values of @xmath2 and we calculate the relevant cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility of having one of the scalar fields as of dark energy while the other could be a scalar field redshifting as matter . </S>"
