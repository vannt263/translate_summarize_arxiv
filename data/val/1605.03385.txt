    "in the many body quantum systems , it is important to investigate the energy spectra , that is , whether gapless or gapped , or the degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "the structure of the energy spectra is related with other physical properties , such as the symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , in the non - relativistic many body quantum systems , general and rigorous theorems remain important .",
    "lieb - schultz - mattis ( lsm ) theorem @xcite is one of them .",
    "historically , lieb , schultz and mattis treated the s=1/2 xxz spin chain , and they showed there exists a low energy o(@xmath0 ) ( @xmath1 : system size ) excited state above the ground state .",
    "affleck and lieb @xcite studied general spin s and su(n ) symmetric cases , and showed the same result as the lsm theorem for half - integer spin cases .",
    "in addition , they considered the relation between the space inversion and the spin reversal symmetries . independently , using the twisted boundary condition , kolb @xcite showed the nontrivial periodicity of the wave number @xmath2 of the lowest energy dispersion as a function of @xmath3 , for half - integer spin chains . and he discussed the continuity of the energy dispersion for @xmath3 .",
    "one limitation of the traditional lsm theorem @xcite is the assumption of the unique ground state ( or the unique lowest energy state in the fixed magnetization subspace ) for the finite system , which is violated in several cases with frustrations ( majumdar - ghosh model @xcite and the incommensurate region ) .",
    "we have separated the proof process of the lsm theorem from the assumption of the unique ground state@xcite .    in our previous paper ,",
    "the wave number @xmath3 plays an important role .",
    "we proved the continuity of the energy spectrum for the irrational magnetization , and the nontrivial periodicity for the rational magnetization .",
    "thus , there are three possibilities of energy spectra in many body quantum systems . in the first case ,",
    "the energy spectrum is continuous with @xmath3 , so it does nt have energy gap ( case ( a ) , see fig.1-a ) .",
    "secondly , an energy gap exists between the ground state and continuous excited states ( case ( b),see fig 1-b ) . and in the third case , the degeneracy of the ground states is the order of system size , as in ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic cases ( case ( c ) ) .        in half integer spin chain with u(1 )",
    "symmetry , when the energy spectrum is gapless ( case ( a ) ) , the low energy modes are at @xmath4 .",
    "when the energy spectrum is gapped above the ground states ( case ( b ) ) , several possibilities can be considered as the ground states .",

    ", we can construct the @xmath4 states .",
    "unfortunately , there is a dilemma .",
    "the lsm - type variational state contains _ both the nel - like ( at @xmath7 ) and the dimer - like ( @xmath7 ) components_. this fact suggests that both states are always gapless _ or _ degenerate with the ground state , which seems unnatural . in this study , considering the discrete symmetries ( the spin reversal , the space inversion and the time reversal ) , we will show that the normalization is important to resolve this dilemma .",
    "furthermore , we show that a part of the discrete symmetries is enough to distinguish the nel - like and the dimer - like states , and for the normalization discussion .",
    "one of the interesting applications is the magnetic plateau @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the symmetries ( the rotation , the space inversion , the translational and the time reversal ) and relating operators , then we discuss symmetry properties of nel or dimer state .",
    "section 3 is a review of the lsm theorem and twisting operators . in section [ section : discrete symmeties and lsm theorem ] , we construct the wave number @xmath7 states by acting the twisting operator to the @xmath8 ground state , and we study the discrete symmetries of the constructed @xmath7 states .",
    "when u(1 ) symmetry , these @xmath7 states have the @xmath9 low energy from the lsm theorem . section [ section : normalization ] is our main result ; we will explain why some of the @xmath7 states do not have to satisfy the lsm inequality , considering the normalization of the states . in section [ section : partial - discrete - symmetry ]",
    ", we show that a part of discrete symmetries is enough for the above arguments .",
    "and we apply our result for several examples ( s=1/2 nnn xxz chain , spin ladder , spin tube and distorted diamond chain ) in section 7 . in section 8",
    ", we discuss symmetric properties of the ground state with system sizes @xmath10 .",
    "section 9 is summary and discussions .",

    "in this subsection we have discussed the symmetries of particular cases , ( [ neelstate ] ) or ( [ neelanddimer2 ] ) . in the following , we will generalize these symmetry consideration , for wide models , ( [ eq : xyz ] ) and quasi 1d spin systems etc .",
    "in this section we review the lsm theorem .",
    "the assumptions of the lsm theorem are the u(1 ) symmetry , the translational symmetry and the short - range interaction . for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : xyz ] ) it means @xmath49 .    in @xcite",
    "we have proven the following inequality : @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 : integer ) are the twisting operators given as : @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the lowest energy in the @xmath55 subspace .",
    "note that the phase factor @xmath56 in ( [ eq : twisting - operator - site ] ) , which is absent in @xcite and @xcite , is introduced to avoid ad hoc calculations , related with the translation , the spin reversal , the site inversion and the time reversal operators .",
    "one result of the extended lsm theorem@xcite is that if the magnetization is irrational , then the energy spectra must be continuous for @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , by using ( [ eq : elsmp ] ) and the squeezing technique , we get the next inequality for spin s half integer : @xmath57      for the site space inversion , the spin reversal and the twisting operator , there are the relations @xcite : @xmath58    next we want to consider the relation between the link space inversion and the twisting operator .",

    "one is that the energy spectrum is gapless .",
    "the other is that the energy gap exists between the dimer - like ground states and the continuous energy spectra ( i.e. the ground states are degenerate at @xmath4 , and the @xmath7 state must satisfy the relations ( [ eq : d1u ] ) , ( [ spinvdimer1 ] ) , ( [ spinvdimer2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dl - time - reversal ] ) ) .",

    ".      our discussion can be also valid in distorted diamond chain @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath203    the diamond chain has 3 sites in unit - cell like the spin ladder and spin tube .",
    "in addition , this model has space inversion symmetry.@xcite therefore , by the same argument , the energy spectrum is gapless or gapped with dimer - like state .",
    "in the case of @xmath205 half - integer , the relation of spin reversal operators becomes @xmath206 , and @xmath207 .",

    "time reversal operator has a similar relation @xmath209 .",
    "thus , algebraic structure of the @xmath205 half - integer case is quite different from the @xmath205 integer case .",
    "since we did not use the periodic boundary condition in the process of derivation in appendix [ appendix : spin - reversal - klein ] , we can apply @xmath207 for the @xmath205 half - integer , or @xmath210 for the @xmath205 integer , also in the open boundary condition .    in periodic boundary condition , we can not distinguish the two type space inversions(site inversion and link inversion ) in odd sites system .",
    "on the other hand , in open boundary condition , only the site inversion can be defined .      for the non - frustrating case , by using mlm type discussion @xcite @xcite",
    ", one can prove that the ground state has @xmath212 in @xmath39 , and @xmath213 in @xmath214@xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath214 , we should choose @xmath35 as @xmath215 instead of ( [ eq : ground - state - condition ] ) , but basically our discussions for @xmath39 are valid also in @xmath214 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the system with discrete symmetries ; the @xmath216 spin reversal , the space inversion ( link or site inversion ) , and the time reversal symmetries . and",
    "when the system has the u(1 ) or su(2 ) continuous symmetry , we can discuss the low - lying states using the lsm theorem .",
    "in section [ section : discrete symmeties and lsm theorem ] we have constructed four states with the twisting operators , then confirmed the discrete symmetries of them . using the discrete symmetries , we classify the @xmath7 states into the dimer - like , the nel - like or other states .",
    "although superficially the lsm theorem suggests both the dimer - like and the nel - like states ( @xmath7 ) are degenerate with the @xmath8 state , we have solved this dilemma by considering the normalization of the dimer - like and the nel - like states in section [ section : normalization ] , where the relation of the normalization and the gap is summarized in the table [ table : abg ] . in section [ section : partial - discrete - symmetry ] , we have shown that a part of discrete symmetries , that is , either the space inversion _ or _ the spin reversal _ or _ the time reversal , is enough for the above arguments . note",
    "that since the spin reversal or the time reversal symmetry means the zero magnetization , it is needed the space inversion symmetry to explain the magnetic plateau .",
    "we mention the relation between the bkt type transition and the present work . as we have discussed in section 7.1 , the classification of table [ table : abg ]",
    "is closely related with the bkt type transition . however , when the number of the degenerate ground states is more than the minimum degeneracy expected from the lsm theorem , such as the ( 2,2 ) antiphase state in section 7.1 , it is not necessarily related with the bkt type transition . moreover",
    "one should classify whether the doublet states is gapped or gapless , plus the classification in table [ table : abg ] .",
    "there is a caution on the statement that at least one of the ground states satisfies ( [ eq : ground - state - condition ] ) in section 2.6 .",
    "this statement may remain valid in the frustrating regions with the zero magnetization , including the majumdar - gosh model .",
    "generally , in the rational magnetization with the space inversion symmetry , the similar statement , at least one of the ground states satisfies @xmath217 and @xmath8 , may be valid .",
    "however the above statement is violated for the irrational magnetization with frustration when the incommensurability occurs .",
    "for example , in the nnn xxz model ( [ eq : s=1/2-nnn - xxz - chain ] ) , the energy dispersion of the one spin flip from the fully aligned state ( @xmath218 ) is the double well form when @xmath219 .",
    "finally , we comment on the symmetry protected topological phases ( sptp ) @xcite@xcite . between our work and sptp , there is a similar point of view ( distinguishing the states by the space inversion , the spin reversal , the time reversal symmetry ) , however , some conditions are different ( sptp : integer spin , our work : half integer spin ) .",
    "other differences are that sptp theory only treats the link inversion as the space inversion , whereas in our theory both the site inversion and the link inversion are considered ; in our theory the magnetic plateaux in the rational magnetization have been treated .",
