    "this paper is about an application of logic to the methodology of science in the spirit of van benthem s @xcite .",
    "there are several axiomatizations of special relativity theory available in the literature , all looking different but claiming to axiomatize the same physical theory",
    ". such are , among many others , the ones in andrka et al .",
    "@xcite , ax  @xcite , goldblatt  @xcite , schelb  @xcite , schutz  @xcite , suppes  @xcite .",
    "these papers talk about very different kinds of objects : @xcite talks about reference frames , @xcite talks about particles and signals , @xcite looks like a purely geometrical theory about orthogonality , the central notion of @xcite is the so - called minkowski - metric , etc . while , as usual , one gets a better picture of this area via a variety of different  eyeglasses \" , the following questions arise .",
    "what are the connections between these theories ?",
    "do they all talk about the same thing ?",
    "if they do , do they capture it to the same extent , or is one axiomatization more detailed or accurate than some of the others ?",
    "in this paper we want to show how , in the framework of mathematical logic , a concrete , tangible comparison / connection can be elaborated between these theories for special relativity and what we can gain from such an investigation .    for this comparison",
    ", we have to use a form of logical definability theory in which totally new kinds of entities can be defined as opposed to traditional definability theory where only new relations can be defined on already available entities .",
    "the existing methods of definability theory had to be modified and refined for the purposes of the present situation .",
    "thus , definability theory , too , profits from such an application . in the present paper ,",
    "we elaborate in detail one piece of such a comparison : we construct an interpretation of the relativity theory in @xcite talking about reference frames into the theory in @xcite which talks about particles emitting and absorbing signals .",
    "then we construct an inverse interpretation for showing which versions of the two theories are definitionally equivalent .",
    "since this is a case - study showing applicability of the proposed method for comparing / connecting theories , we tried to give all the detail needed .",
    "this is why some sections of the paper may look somewhat technical .",
    "an insight of last century mathematical logic is that it is important to fix the vocabulary of a first - order logic theory and stay inside the so obtained language while in a specific theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the symbols in the vocabulary are the concepts that are not analyzed further in the given theory , they are called thus basic ( or primitive ) concepts .",
    "but this is not a forever frozen state : we may decide to analyze further the basic concepts of this vocabulary and we can do this in the form of building an interpretation ( in the sense of mathematical logic ) into another language the vocabulary of which consists of new basic concepts , and the interpretation gives us the information of how the  old basic concepts \" are built up from the  new basic concepts \" as refined ones .",
    "the interpretation we construct in this paper thus refines the basic concept of a reference frame in terms of just sending and receiving signals . to refine the basic concepts of this signalling theory",
    ", we can interpret it to , say , in a theory of electromagnetism , or in a quantum - mechanical theory .",
    "such an interpretation may also be regarded as defining a so - called operational semantics for the basic concepts of the first theory . starting with the vienna circle ,",
    "several authors suggest that a physical theory is a more complex object than just a set of first - order logic ( fol for short ) formulas .",
    "a physical theory , they propose , is a fol theory together with instructions for how to interpret the basic symbols ( or vocabulary ) of this theory  in the real physical world \" .",
    "( following carnap  @xcite , this is often called a  ( partially ) interpreted theory \" . )",
    "we want to show in section [ sec : reduc ] that such an  operational semantics \" can be taken to be an interpretation in the sense of mathematical logic .    returning to our concrete example",
    ", an operational semantics should say something about how we obtain or set up ( in the real world ) the reference frames for special relativity theory .",
    "usually , rigid meter - rods and standard clocks are used for this purpose ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , as @xcite points out , we can not use these rigid meter - rods in astronomy or cosmology .",
    "the interpretation we give in detail in this paper results also in an operational / experimental / observational definition for setting up a reference frame by just relying on sending and receiving light - signals .",
    "this method can be used , in principle , in the above mentioned astronomical scale .",
    "summing up , the first language in an interpretation has the theoretical concepts while the basic concepts of the second language are the observational ones ( for the observational - theoretical duality see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can look at the same interpretation  from the other direction \" : in our example , we may imagine someone living in a space - time , exploring his surroundings by sending and receiving signals , and during this process , he devises so - called theoretical concepts which make thinking more efficient .",
    "in particular , he may devise the concept of a reference frame , and even the concept of quantities forming a field , as mental constructs having concrete definitions in terms of observations .",
    "the tools of mathematical logic , and more closely those of definability theory ( interpretations are among them ) can be used for modeling this emergence of theoretical concepts .",
    "a further aim of the present approach of comparing theories is shifting the emphasis from working inside a single huge theory to working in a modularized hierarchy of smaller theories connected in many ways .",
    "usually this approach is called theory - hierarchy .",
    "we note that this is not so much a hierarchy as rather a category of theories , technically the category of all fol - theories as objects with interpretations as morphisms of the category .",
    "this direction of replacing a huge theory with a category of small theories is present in many parts of science . in foundational thinking",
    ", @xcite emphasizes this . in computer science , it is present in the form of structured programming .",
    " putting theories together \" of burstall and goguen @xcite refers to the act of computing / generating colimits of certain diagrams in this category . even in such practical areas as using a huge medical data - base",
    "the need of modularizing arises : it is necessary to  break up \" the given data - base and generate many smaller ones according to the query at hand @xcite .",
    "the interpretation going from special relativity as formalized in @xcite into the more observational signalling theory of @xcite we build in the present paper is but one morphism of this huge dynamic category of fol theories .",
    "the content of this paper can also be viewed as preparing the ground for an application of algebraic logic to relativity theory , as follows .",
    "the cylindric algebra of a theory is an abstract representation of the structure of concepts expressible / definable in that theory and a homomorphism between two cylindric algebras corresponds to an interpretation between the corresponding theories .",
    "hence the category of all fol theories is basically the same as the category of cylindric algebras as objects and homomorphisms as morphisms .",
    "there are , for example , well known and understood methods for how to compute colimits in this category of algebras .",
    "there are still many questions and phenomena to be understood in this area of application of logic .",
    "for example , what are the desirable or good properties of an interpretation for being informative about the theories in one or other respect ? consider for a second the definability / interpretability picture between scientific theories ( in fol ) in two versions : ( 1 ) in the framework of traditional definability theory , and ( 2 ) in the new , extended theory of definability used in the present paper .",
    "what are the characteristic differences ?",
    "we think it is useful to keep this picture / issue in mind .",
    "in section  [ sec : sr ] we briefly recall the relativity theory @xmath0 from @xcite , in section  [ sec : sigth ] we recall signalling theory @xmath1 from @xcite and we try to give a basic feeling for it by sketching the proof of completeness theorem in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : algo ] is an important part of the present paper , it contains an algorithm for how to set up a reference frame in signalling theory , this is an  operational semantics \" for setting up reference frames of @xcite . at the end of the section",
    "we outline how the same method could be used for space - times other than special relativistic , e.g. , for the schwarzshild space - time of a black hole .",
    "this algorithm is at the heart of the interpretation elaborated in section  [ sec : reduc ] .",
    "section  [ sec : defth ] recalls the features of the more refined definability theory that are needed for defining the interpretation of @xmath2 into @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ sec : defeq ] rounds up the picture between @xmath0 and @xmath1 by interpreting @xmath1 in a slightly reinforced version of @xmath0 and then giving more information about connections between various concrete theories of special relativity .",
    "we end the paper with a conclusion .",
    "in this section we give a list of basic concepts and axioms of the fol theory @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "the basic notions not analyzed further in @xmath0 are  observers \" having reference frames in which they represent the world - lines of bodies ( or test particles ) , of which signals ( light - particles , or photons ) are special ones .",
    "the world - line of a body represents its motion , it is a function that describes the location of the body at each instant . for representing  time \" and  location \" , observers use quantities , quantities are endowed with addition and multiplication in order to be able to express whether a motion is  uniform \" or not . to make life simpler ,",
    "we treat also observers as special bodies .",
    "( another , equivalent , option would be to treat them as entities of different  kind \" , or of different  sort \" , than bodies and quantities . ) the reference frame or world - view of an observer @xmath3 gives the information which bodies @xmath4 are present at time @xmath5 at location @xmath6 ; thus @xmath7 expresses that body @xmath4 is present at @xmath5 in @xmath8 , according to observer @xmath3 .",
    "we treat quantities as entities of different nature , of different kind , than bodies .    according to the above",
    ", the vocabulary of the language of @xmath0 is the following : we have two sorts , bodies @xmath9 and quantities @xmath10 , we have two unary relations @xmath11 of sort @xmath9 , we have two binary functions @xmath12 of sort @xmath10 , and we have a six - place relation @xmath13 the first 2 places of which are of sort @xmath9 and the rest of sort @xmath10 .",
    "next , we list the five axioms of @xmath0 . concrete formulas and more intuition can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the world - lines of photons are exactly the straight lines of slope 1 , in each reference frame .",
    "all observers coordinatize the same physical reality ( i.e. , the same set of events ) .",
    "the  owner \" of a reference frame sits tight ( stays put ) at the origin .",
    "the quantities form a euclidean field w.r.t .  the operations @xmath12 , this means that @xmath14 form an ordered field in which each positive quantity has a square root .",
    "all observers use the same units of measurement : if two events are simultaneous for observers @xmath15 , then the spatial distance between them is the same according to @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16and + @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath0 may seem to be a rather weak axiom system . however , this is not so .",
    "all the well - known theorems / predictions of the ( kinematics of ) special relativity can be proved even from @xmath2 .",
    "below is a sample of theorems that can be proved from @xmath2 ( for proofs , further theorems provable from @xmath0 , and for extensions see the references given earlier as well as @xcite ) :    @xmath18 : :    each observer moves uniformly and slower than light in any other    observer s world - view ( i.e. , the world - line of an observer is a    straight line with slope less than 1 ) .",
    ": :    assume that @xmath15 are moving relative to each other .",
    "@xmath18 : :    events that are separated in @xmath3 s world - view in a    direction of @xmath19 s motion and simultaneous according to    @xmath3 , are not simultaneous according to @xmath3. @xmath18 : :    events that are simultaneous according to both @xmath3 and    @xmath19 are exactly the ones that are separated orthogonally    to the direction of motion of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18 : :    assume that @xmath3 and @xmath19 use the same units of    measurement , i.e. , the spatial distance between events that are    simultaneous to both of them is the same according to them .",
    "then    a - synchronicity , time - dilation and length - contraction between    @xmath3 and @xmath19 are exactly according to the    known formula of special relativity , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 : :    the world - view transformations between observers in    @xmath2 are exactly the bijections    that preserve minkowski - equidistance ; these bijections are the    so - called poincar - transformations composed with dilations and    field - automorphisms .",
    "@xmath18 : :    the world - view transformations between observers in    @xmath0 are exactly the bijections    that preserve minkowski - distance ; these bijections are the so - called    poincar - transformations .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "a reference frame is a basic ( or primitive ) notion , just an  out - of - the - blue \" assigning space - and - time coordinates to events , which all together have to satisfy some regularities ( our axioms ) .",
    "the theory does not address the question of how an observer sets up his reference frame .",
    "as already outlined in the introduction , according to some authors , a physical theory ( a theory about our physical reality ) , should say something about the meaning ( in the  real \" physical world ) of the basic concepts , if not otherwise , then in natural language one could amend the theory with a set of so - called _ operational rules _ about how the basic concepts ( the reference frames in our case ) are set up ( experimentally ) . here",
    "usually meter - rods and wrist - watches , or standard clocks , are used , see e.g. , taylor and wheeler ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.s 9,135 ) , l.  e.  szabo @xcite . in section  [ sec : algo ] we give a more ambitious algorithm for setting up coordinate systems .",
    "the intention of ax s theory is to give an axiom system for special relativity so that its basic symbols and axioms are designed to be observational .",
    "the players of this theory are experimenters that can  communicate with each other \" by sending signals to each other .",
    "together , as a team the experimenters can  map \" ( or explore ) space - time , without having rigid meter rods or clocks . a definition of an introduced ( or defined ) term in this first - order logic theory can be viewed as an experiment designed to establish whether the defined term holds or not .",
    "the basic terms of space and time are defined this way .",
    "( indeed , in this theory one can define  rigid meter rods \" and  clocks \" from signalling experiments . )",
    "the results of the experiments we make can be built into axioms then ( which are designed to be observational - oriented ) , and they can tell us in what kind of space - time we live in .",
    "special relativistic ?",
    "hyperbolic space with relativistic time ?",
    "general relativistic ?",
    "all this amounts to an implementation of leibnitzian relational notion of space and time .",
    "we return to this subject in more detail in the next section .",
    "we begin to describe ax s theory which we call signalling theory @xmath1 . in the vocabulary of @xmath1 we have two sorts , @xmath20 for  particles \" ( or experimenters , or agents ) and @xmath21 for  signals \" ( or light - signals ) ; and we have two binary relations @xmath22 between particles and signals .",
    "the intended meanings of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are  @xmath25 transmits ( or emits , or sends out ) @xmath26 \" , and ",
    "@xmath25 receives ( or absorbs ) @xmath26 \" , respectively .",
    "ax @xcite uses an impersonal terminology of particle physics , particles emit and absorb signals .",
    "we are more attracted to a terminology of communication between active experimenters .",
    "these experimenters ( players ) of @xmath1 are somewhat analogous to the observers of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "when talking about ax s signalling theory , we will use the terms experimenter and particle interchangeably .    the  standard \" ( or intended )",
    "model we have in mind is the following : let us fix a euclidean field @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath20 is the set of all straight lines in @xmath28 with slope less than 1 , and @xmath21 is the set of all directed finite segments ( including the segments of length zero ) of straight lines with slope 1 . a particle @xmath25 transmits a signal @xmath26 iff the beginning point of @xmath26 lies on @xmath25 , and @xmath25 receiving the signal @xmath26 means that the endpoint of @xmath26 lies on @xmath25 . let us denote this structure by @xmath29 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is a finite set @xmath30 of axioms , our @xmath1 , which characterizes the class of standard models , i.e. , the models of @xmath30 are exactly the standard models @xmath29 over some euclidean field @xmath27 ( thm.1 in @xcite ) . @xmath1",
    "consists of three groups of axioms , altogether it has 23 elements . instead of listing these 23 axioms , in this paper we will use ax s completeness theorem , since that implies that a formula @xmath31 is provable from @xmath1 iff @xmath31 is true in all the standard models .",
    "the question immediately arises : what does this theory @xmath1 have to do with special relativity ? do not we lose much expressive power by using such meager resources ? where do a - synchronicity , time - dilation ,",
    "length - contraction come into the picture in @xmath1 ?",
    "some answers are in the proof of thm.1 which we briefly outline below",
    ". we will give more explicit answers to these questions in the coming sections  [ sec : algo ] , [ sec : reduc ] .",
    "in particular , we will show that everything we can say in the language of @xmath0 can be said in the spartan language of @xmath1 , too .",
    "one of the ideas for proving this can be traced back to hilbert , as will be noted below figure  [ times - fig ] .    to give a feeling for @xmath1 and the expressive power of its language",
    ", we briefly outline the proof of ax s completeness theorem .",
    "let s begin by making a little elbow - room for working .",
    "we will need to express things such as  two signals are received by an experimenter at the same time \" , and ",
    "signal @xmath26 was received by an experimenter just when he transmitted signal @xmath32 \" .",
    "since we have no notion of time in our language , we have to express these notions just by using the basic concepts of transmitting and receiving signals . here",
    "comes how we can do this .",
    "the ( open ) formula  @xmath33 \" is true in a standard model just when the beginning points of the segments @xmath34 coincide , we say that @xmath35 expresses this fact . and",
    "@xmath21 , respectively . in place of conjunction @xmath36",
    "we will simply write a comma . ] similarly ,  @xmath37 \" expresses that the endpoint of @xmath26 coincides with the beginning point of @xmath32 , etc .",
    "now can we express that two particles / experimenters meet ?",
    "well , they meet if there is a signal that both of them transmit . from now on we will use similar statements without translating them to the language of @xmath1 .    to begin outlining the idea of ax s completeness proof , let @xmath38 be any model of @xmath1 , and let @xmath39 be any experimenter in this model .",
    "we will construct an isomorphism between @xmath38 and a standard model @xmath29 which takes @xmath39 to the time - axis in @xmath29 . from now on , in this section @xmath39 denotes this fixed experimenter .",
    "we define the set @xmath40 of  places \" or  locations \" for experimenter @xmath39 to consist of those particles which are motionless w.r.t .  @xmath39 . for expressing that two particles are motionless w.r.t .  each other ,",
    "any formula expressing this in the standard models will do .",
    "ax uses the following formula : @xmath41 is motionless w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 exactly when @xmath39 and @xmath41 do not meet ( if they are not equal ) and there are two other particles @xmath42 which meet them and each other in 5 distinct events .",
    "ax then expresses the betweenness relation @xmath43 for such places as well as the equidistance relation @xmath44 with suitable formulas .",
    "having all this , the first group of axioms in @xmath1 states tarski",
    "s axioms for axiomatizing euclidean geometry over the euclidean fields ( see @xcite ) . from tarski s theorem",
    "then ax gets a euclidean field @xmath27 and an isomorphism between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    having @xmath40 for our experimenter @xmath39 , what is  time \" for it ?",
    "what are the things that we mark with time ? the events . and what are the events ? in the present vocabulary we take them to be  particle @xmath4 emits / receives a signal @xmath26 \" , more precisely we take the equivalence classes of them described when we made the elbow - room for this proof ( e.g. , particle @xmath4 may send out signal @xmath26 in the same event when it sends out another signal @xmath32 or when it receives @xmath32 ) .",
    "then our experimenter @xmath39 s time will be the events that happened to @xmath39 . for simplicity",
    ", we will represent events with special signals , as explained below .    in the standard models",
    ", there are special signals that are received by everyone who transmitted them , we call these signals _ events _ , we will denote them by variants of @xmath47 :    @xmath48 .    in the standard models ,",
    "events are the light - like segments of zero length , so they correspond to elements of @xmath28 .",
    "( these zero - length signals may look counter - intuitive to some readers .",
    "it is just handy and not important that we use or have these at hand , everything works with a slight modification if we omit these short signals from the standard models . ) we say that event @xmath47 happened to experimenter @xmath39 , or in other words , experimenter @xmath39 _ participated in event _",
    "@xmath47 , if @xmath39 transmitted ( and then also received ) @xmath47 .",
    "the events that happened to @xmath39 will constitute @xmath39 s _ world - line_.    we can then express simultaneity of events by using that the speeds of light - signals are the same ( see figure  [ sim - fig ] ) .",
    "ax then states an axiom to the effect that signals make a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath39 s world - line and the simultaneous events on any given line in @xmath40 .",
    "this makes @xmath39 s world - line isomorphic to @xmath27 , we take this to be the time - axis . from now on it is more or less straightforward what we have to include to @xmath1 in order to make @xmath38 isomorphic to @xmath29 .",
    "e.g. , we can state that for any event @xmath47 there is a simultaneous event @xmath49 on the world - line of @xmath39 , and there is a particle @xmath41 that participates in @xmath49 and is motionless w.r.t .",
    "this concludes the proof - idea .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold .",
    "firstly , in section  [ sec : reduc ] we want to give an interpretation of @xmath2 into @xmath1 , and for this we need concrete formulas representing the proof - idea given in the previous section .",
    "for example , ax used tarski s theorem for getting the euclidean field @xmath27 , but we will need to exhibit concrete formulas defining this @xmath27 . secondly , we want to make the previous proof - idea into an algorithm for setting up coordinate systems ( i.e. , reference frames ) with the use of just light - signals and freely moving particles .",
    "this could also be viewed as providing _",
    "operational semantics _ to the basic notion of a coordinate system of @xmath0 .",
    "what we give in this section will not be an algorithm in the strict sense , it will be more like a recipe for how to design experiments / measurements for assigning coordinates to events .",
    "these experiments will also be suitable for finding out / confirming that we live in a special relativistic space - time ( if we do ) .",
    "for this reason , we will try to make the formulas  executable \" when possible .",
    "there will be plenty of room for improving on this aspect , the reader is invited to design more practical experiments .",
    "assume that we are given a model @xmath38 of @xmath1 , and @xmath39 is an experimenter in this model .",
    "just as in the previous section , this experimenter @xmath39 is fixed throughout this section .",
    "we are going to give @xmath39 a recipe for defining a field @xmath27 of quantities and for assigning four quantities to each event .",
    "such an assignment is called a _ coordinate system _ ( or reference frame ) .",
    "these coordinate systems will satisfy the axioms of @xmath2 .",
    "a _ location _ for @xmath39 was defined as a particle that is motionless w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 . in the previous section we recalled a formula , from @xcite , expressing whether @xmath41 is motionless w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 ( in symbols , @xmath50 )",
    ". however , the algorithm suggested by that formula is not very convenient since it involves deciding whether @xmath39 meets @xmath41 or not , and for this @xmath39 has to know all the events that happened and will happen to him .",
    "this is not very practical as an experiment , since @xmath39 may need to  wait \" for an infinity of time before he could know the result . using the",
    "affine desargues property ( adp for short , see , e.g. , @xcite ) one can design a more realistic experiment which decides @xmath50  in a finite time \" , we are going to describe it now .",
    "we note that in the standard models @xmath29 the adp is true , because it is true in the affine space @xmath28 , for any field @xmath27 .    for a while",
    ", it will be easier to think in 4-dimensional space - time than tracing motion in 3-dimensional space .",
    "geometrically , @xmath41 is motionless w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 iff the world - line of @xmath41 is parallel to that of @xmath39 .",
    "the conclusion of the adp is that two lines are parallel , but in the hypothesis part parallelism of two other sets of lines are used .",
    "we are lucky : we have light - signals and their speeds are the same in both directions , thus we can use parallelism of world - lines of two sets of light - signals in the hypothesis part of the adp . the experiment is depicted in geometrical form in the left - hand part of figure  [ des - fig ] . here is the  non - geometrical \" description of the experiment : assume @xmath39 wants to decide whether @xmath41 is motionless w.r.t .  him or not .",

    "we defined natural coordinate systems to the particles .",
    "( these coordinate systems correspond to the observers in @xmath0 , this correspondence will be made explicit in section  [ sec : reduc ] . ) now , the coordinate - transformations between these are so that the three paradigmatic effects of special relativity ( mentioned in section  [ sec : sr ] ) hold in a version where we can recalibrate the units of measurement .",
    "this section contains definitions only , definitions ( with some parameters ) in the language of @xmath1 that in the standard models define coordinate systems for the particles / experimenters .",
    "we can get an axiom system characterizing the standard models ( thus doing the job of @xmath1 ) via using these definitions .",
    "namely , we can state as axioms that the coordinate systems defined for the experimenters have all the good properties we want ( e.g. , the beginning and end - points of light - signals are exactly those of the ordered segments of slope 1 ) .",
    "this alternative axiom system would be more complicated and less natural than @xmath1 of @xcite , however , it would be the result of a clear - cut method that can be used in many other situations , as indicated below .",
    "we can use the method of this section for exploring space - times other than the special relativistic one , and for using signals of various different nature , too .",
    "we mention some examples briefly , we think that elaborating these examples would be worthwhile .",
    "we can use the method of setting up a coordinate system as described in this section , for example , for a particle moving faster - than - light ( ftl ) in a special relativistic space - time .",
    "so , let us take as standard models the standard models @xmath29 modified so that the particles are the lines with slope more than 1 ( and not the ones with slope less than 1 ) .",
    "if we apply our method to these modified models , then the ftl experimenter @xmath39 will find that its space @xmath117 is a 3-dimensional minkowski - space @xmath162 , and not a euclidean space @xmath163 .",
    "he can reach by signals directly , and check whether they are motionless w.r.t .",
    "him , only those places / brothers that are time - like separated from him in terms of @xmath164 , but he can get indirect information about the rest of places by communicating with these primarily reachable brothers . by working through the details , we can get an axiom system @xmath165 axiomatizing the signalling models of ftl experimenters that would be quite analogous to ax s @xmath1 . the main difference would be that the first group of axioms for 3-dimensional euclidean space would be replaced by an analogous axiom system for 3-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "for this we can use the one devised by goldblatt in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) . for a slightly different approach for including ftl observers in this setting see @xcite .    however , communicating with directed signals ( as in @xmath1 ) between ftl experimenters is rather restricted if we want to take the experiments to be executable ( ftl experimenters can get information this way only about the part of their space @xmath164 which is in their  past \" in terms of @xmath164 as a minkowski - space ) .",
    "we can change the nature of signals to be undirected ( but otherwise letting their speed to be 1 ) , imagining that if two events are connected with a signal , then the information this signal carries appears at both events  at once \" .",
    "this is connected somehow to time - travel , a subject strongly connected to ftl motion .",
    "the method given in the present section is suitable for exploring space - time with undirected signals , too .",
    "the method given in this section can also be used for giving meaning to two - dimensional time .",
    "time being 2-dimensional could simply mean that the events happening with the experimenters can be best described by , say , the structure @xmath166 .",
    "for example , one could assume that our experimenter lives in a world characterized by the 2 + 2-dimensional minkowski - metric @xmath167 and then apply our method to see what kind of coordinate system he would set up for himself , and in general , what kind of responses he would get to his experiments .",
    "finally , we can imagine using signals of infinite velocity , this way we can explore the newtonian space - time characterized by absolute time . or , we can use bent signals of general relativity .",
    "for example , we can explore the outer part of the schwarzshild black hole ( the space - time outside the event horizon ) with the same method .",
    "we would take as experimenters a team of densely placed suspended observers ( spaceships in outer space using their drives to maintain their desired positions ) , constantly checking positions by communicating with photons ( as light - signals ) , and using freely - falling spaceships ( or astronauts ) as messengers .",
    "our aim is to clarify the connections between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "not only the vocabularies of these two theories are disjoint , even on the intuitive level they speak of different kinds of things .",
    "we can see that somehow photons and observers of @xmath0 correspond to signals and particles of @xmath1 , but what correspond to quantities in @xmath1 ?",
    "quantities of @xmath0 do not seem to enter the picture in @xmath1 . yet , in section [ sec : algo ] we defined something that intuitively could correspond to quantities in @xmath1 . in this section",

    "i.e. , the two theories are almost the same , the only difference is that @xmath1 assumes time - orientation while goldblatt s theory does not . the proof of this last statement can be put together from the definitions and ideas in sections  [ sec : algo ] , [ sec : reduc ] . also , ( a slight variant of ) our @xmath0 is definitionally equivalent to ( a slight variant of ) suppes s axiomatization of special relativity in @xcite .",
    "we intended to show in this paper some results the methods of mathematical logic can provide for other branches of science , in particular , for physics and the methodology of science . using the tools of definability theory of first - order logic , we compared in detail two rather different axiom systems for special relativity theory .",
    "one of these , @xmath0 of @xcite , is coordinate - system- , or reference frame - oriented , while the other , @xmath1 of @xcite , uses meager resources and talks about particles emitting and absorbing signals .",
    "the two theories use disjoint languages and talk about different kinds of entities . yet",
    ", a precise comparison was made possible by using mathematical logic , and we obtained the following : @xmath1 can express and states everything that @xmath0 does , except for the relativistic ( minkowski ) distance between events ( implied by @xmath347 in @xmath0 ) , while in addition it states time - orientation for space - time together with some auxiliary simplifying axioms ( @xmath323 ) . informally ,          a byproduct of these investigations is a concrete operational semantics for special relativity theory .",
