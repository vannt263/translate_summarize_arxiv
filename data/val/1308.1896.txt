    "the idea that space - time may have more than four dimensions goes back to kaluza and .",
    "they introduced one extra space dimension in an attempt to unify gravity with the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "there of course arise the question of why this extra dimension is not visible to us . a simple explanation of this fact is to assume that the extra dimension is compactified to a very small circle .",
    "kaluza - klein theory can be extended to include also non - abelian gauge fields using more extra dimensions .",
    "extra dimensions appear naturally in the context of string theories as well .",
    "an interesting feature is that the low energy sector of some string theories ( see , for instance , the discussion in @xcite ) is described by an einstein - gauss - bonnet theory rather then general relativity .",
    "einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) theory is actually the simplest generalization of general relativity ( gr ) to higher dimensions in the sense that it leads to second order differential equations in the metric even if the action contains higher powers of the curvature . in four dimensions",
    "the gauss - bonnet term does not affect the equations of motion as it is a boundary term .",
    "however in any space - time dimension higher than four its variation gives a non - trivial contribution to the equations of motion .",
    "einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity is member of a larger family of higher curvature gravity theories : indeed in any higher odd dimension it is possible to add to the gravitational action another higher power curvature term ( in five dimensions ",
    "quadratic , in seven ",
    "cubic , in nine  quartic and so on ) in such a way that the resulting equations of motion remain of second order .",
    "this family of gravity theories is called lovelock gravity  @xcite .    one peculiar feature of the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , which distinguish it from standard general relativity , is that the field equations do not necessarily imply the vanishing of torsion @xcite , so that in the first order formalism , besides the graviton , there are additional propagating degrees of freedom related to the torsion .",
    "indeed exact solutions with non - trivial torsion have been found @xcite , but here we will consider the torsion free case .",
    "the most generic einstein - gauss - bonnet action in any space - time dimension higher than four is the sum of three terms namely an einstein - hilbert term @xmath1 , a gauss - bonnet term @xmath2 and a volume term @xmath3 . the volume term in the context of general relativity",
    "is called the `` cosmological term '' however , as we will see in the next section , in the presence of a gauss - bonnet term , the value of the effective cosmological constant is actually a function of all three coupling constants and not just of the volume term .",
    "indeed this theory being quadratic in the curvature can have up to two different maximally symmetric constant curvature solutions .",
    "the values of the curvature of the maximally symmetric solutions are the effective cosmological constants of the theory .",
    "interestingly enough it can also happen for certain regions of the parameter space that the theory does not admit any maximally symmetric solution .",
    "this sector of the theory has not been studied very much up to now especially in the context of cosmology but it is actually of great theoretical interest since it generates in a natural way a symmetry breaking mechanism induced by geometry in which there is no solution with the maximum number of killing fields which are allowed in principle by the geometry . in this sense one could speak of `` geometric frustration '' .    in cosmology",
    "the addition of gauss - bonnet term to the action is of special interest in order to study how it affects the size evolution of the extra dimensions ( see @xcite for older and recent developments in cosmology with gauss - bonnet and more general lovelock terms ; for an updated review and references see @xcite ) . in the context of extra dimensions",
    "the most important question is why the extra dimensions are small and of approximately constant size while the three space dimensions are much larger and expanding .",
    "the extra dimensions may have been much larger in the far past and non - constant in size .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to find a dynamical mechanism of compactification dictated just by the equations of motion derived from the gravitational action .",
    "a sensible requirement is that such a mechanism should not involve any fine - tuning of the coupling constants of the theory . indeed ,",
    "if the compactification mechanism only works for a precise value of the couplings of the theory , any small change could destroy it .",
    "moreover in cosmology `` naturalness '' is often advocated , namely good phenomenological behavior should be obtained without assuming that one of the couplings of the theory is much smaller than the others .",
    "such a dynamical mechanics was proposed in @xcite for ( 5 + 1)-dimensional egb theory ; but we are proposing here a more generic setup with arbitrary number of extra dimensions , curvature in both manifolds and a volume term ( lambda term ) in the action which opens new scenarios .    in @xcite , it was shown for the first time how to construct a realistic static compactification ( namely , the extra dimensions do not evolve in time ) in seven ( or higher ) dimensions in lovelock gravities .",
    "a suitable class of cubic lovelock theories allows to recover general relativity with a small cosmological constant in four dimensions with the extra dimensions of constant curvature .",
    "however , in the cases analyzed in @xcite , in order to get the desired compactification both a fine - tuning ( namely , one of the couplings is a function of the others ) and a violation of `` naturalness '' are necessary . here",
    "we want to improve such situation in a cosmological context within the framework of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "we will therefore use the ansatz of a space - time which is a warped product of the form , where @xmath4 is a friedmann - robertson - walker manifold with scale factor @xmath5 whereas @xmath6 is a d - dimensional euclidean compact and constant curvature manifold with scale factor @xmath7 and study the evolution of the two scale factors . due to the highly nonlinear nature of the equations of motion",
    "it is not possible to integrate them in a closed form .",
    "however it is possible to understand in detail all the relevant features of the theory depending on the values of the couplings and of the curvature of space and extra dimension by performing a numerical analysis .    in most cases , when considering the gauss - bonnet , or even higher - order lovelock gravity , in literature spatially flat sections are considered . in our paper",
    "we decided to consider also the case with non - zero constant curvature as it allows us to see the influence of the curvature on the cosmological dynamics . despite the fact that , according to current observational cosmological data , our universe is flat with a high precision , at the early stages of the universe evolution the curvature could comes into play .",
    "in there , negative curvature only `` helps '' inflation ( since the effective equation of state for negative curvature is @xmath8 ) , while the positive curvature affects the inflationary asymptotics , but its influence is not strong for a wide variety of the scalar field potentials ( see @xcite for details ) , so that we can safely consider both signs for curvature without worrying for inflationary asymptotics .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in the second section we will give a basic review on the relevant features of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory especially the relation between the couplings of the theory and the effective cosmological and newton constant . in the third section",
    "we will write down the equations of motion for our metric ansatz in generic dimension and for generic space and extra dimension curvature . later in the same section we will present the results , as well as discuss the stability of the solution in the large number of extra dimensions . in the last section",
    "the conclusions will be drawn .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet action in arbitrary dimension possesses 3 coupling constants and in the vielbein formalism reads    @xmath9    the couplings @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond the the gauss - bonnet term , einstein - hilbert term and the volume `` cosmological '' term respectively . when the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath10 is zero the coupling @xmath12 is just the `` cosmological constant '' and the coupling @xmath11 is just be the newton constant .",
    "however if @xmath10 is non - vanishing this is in general not true .",
    "indeed the cosmological constant is the quantity which gives the curvature of the maximally symmetric solution of the theory .",
    "it is therefore useful to study the equations of motion obtained by varying the action with respect to the vielbein ( which in the metric formalism correspond to the einstein - gauss - bonnet field equations ) , they read    @xmath13    the value of the @xmath0-dimensional `` cosmological constant '' is given by the value of the constant curvature of the maximally symmetric space - time solutions .",
    "the ansatz for a constant curvature space - time in the vielbein formalism reads    @xmath14    where of course @xmath15 must be real .",
    "plugging this ansatz into the equations of motion one gets a polynomial in @xmath15    @xmath16    this equation admits as solution    @xmath17    this implies that in general the cosmological constant is a function of all three couplings of the action and not just @xmath12 . if the discriminant is positive , the theory possesses two different possible cosmological constants which can even have opposite sign .",
    "a special case exists when the couplings are fine tuned in such a way that the discriminant is zero then the two roots of the polynomial are degenerate . in the case that @xmath18",
    "the discriminant can also be negative . in this case",
    "the two possible values for the cosmological constant are complex which means that in this case no maximally symmetric solution exists at all . this interesting phenomenon can be interpreted as induced by `` geometric frustration '' which prevents the existence of metrics preserving all the symmetries which in principle are available .",
    "it is worth noting that this can only happen when the highest power in the curvature of the lovelock action is even ( otherwise at least one real root would always exist ) .",
    "moreover , the parameters region in which ( at least ) a maximally symmetric vacuum exist has been already extensively analyzed in the literature . since it is known that , in such a region , it is not possible to obtain a dynamical compactification which is both free of fine - tunings and free of violations of the naturalness hypothesis , we will focus on the region in which geometric frustration occurs .",
    "another important feature of this theory , in opposition to gr , is that by compactifying the space - time to @xmath19 where @xmath4 is a four dimensional space - time and @xmath6 is some compact manifold with constant curvature @xmath20 is that the newton constant of the effective four dimensional theory is not just proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "this can be seen by projecting the @xmath21 dimensional equations down to four dimensions    @xmath22    where the lowercase indices run from zero to three .",
    "the term @xmath23 which multiplies the four dimensional curvature two form @xmath24 is the `` effective newton constant '' whereas the term @xmath25 is an `` effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant '' .",
    "this means that if the gauss - bonnet term does not vanish and moreover the @xmath26-dimensional curvature does not vanish the effective newton constant is not just proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the effective newton constant can even have a negative sign .",
    "nowadays it is widely accepted that the search for a unified theory requires additional space - time dimensions , the egb theory being the simplest generalization of general relativity to higher dimensions .    in the present paper",
    "we want to show that in a cosmological context one can get a dynamical compactification in an open region of the parameter space ( and in agreement with the `` naturalness hypothesis '' ) in which a potentially @xmath21 universe evolves towards a @xmath27 universe in which the size of the extra dimensions is much smaller than the size of the 4 macroscopic dimensions .",
    "the key feature of egb theory which gives rise to a phenomenologically realistic dynamical compactification is the possibility of geometric symmetry breaking mentioned above which can only occur in lovelock theories in which the highest power of the curvature tensor is even .",
    "the ansatz for the metric is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the metric of two constant curvature manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is worth to point out that even a negative constant curvature space can be compactified by making the quotient of the space by a freely acting discrete subgroup of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the vielbein can then be chosen as @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for the intrinsic vielbein of @xmath31 , @xmath36 stands for the intrinsic vielbein of @xmath37 , and @xmath38  is the levi - civita symbols on @xmath31 .",
    "the spin connection reads    @xmath39    where @xmath40 corresponds to the intrinsic levi - civita connection of @xmath31 , @xmath41 corresponds to the intrinsic levi - civita connection of @xmath42 .",
    "the riemannian curvature reads @xmath43where @xmath44 stands for the intrinsic riemannian curvature of the manifold @xmath31 , @xmath45 stands for the intrinsic riemannian curvature of the manifold @xmath42 ( which will play the role of the extra - dimensional manifold ) .",
    "we will assume ( as it is usual in literature ) that @xmath31 and @xmath42 have constant riemmanian curvatures given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that@xmath48 } { a^{2}}e^{i}e^{j};\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;r^{ab}=\\frac{\\left [ \\gamma _ { \\left ( \\mathbf{d}\\right ) } + \\left ( \\overset{.}{b}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] } { b^{2}}e^{a}e^{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it will be convenient to use the following notation @xmath49 with@xmath50 } { a^{2}},\\ \\ \\ b_{(2)}=\\frac{\\left [ \\gamma _ { \\left ( \\mathbf{d}\\right ) } + \\left ( \\overset{.}{b}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] } { b^{2}}.\\label{abdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it will be convenient to define the following rescaled coupling constants appearing in the original action in ( [ actionegb ] ) @xmath51 thus , @xmath52 is related to the coupling constant of the einstein - hilbert term , @xmath53 corresponds to the gauss - bonnet coupling constant while @xmath54 is a cosmological term .",
    "according to idea of `` naturalness '' discussed above , no one of the original coupling constants of the theory @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is privileged with respect to the others : the three - dimensional parameters space of the theory will be analyzed without any fine - tuning .",
    "the structure of the torsion - free equations of motions is the following:@xmath58    thus , the equations @xmath59 and @xmath60 read:@xmath61@xmath62@xmath63@xmath64while the equation @xmath65 reads@xmath66@xmath67@xmath68@xmath69 this notation in which the @xmath26 factors appear in the denominators is suitable for a large @xmath26 analysis in which one assumes that the physical quantities ( the two scale factors in the present case ) are analytic functions of @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , one can expand both scale factors in series of @xmath70 with time - dependent coefficients and replace the expressions into eqs .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) , ( [ eqq1 ] ) and ( [ eqq2 ] ) .",
    "this allows to derive a set of recursive equations order by order in the @xmath70 expansion .",
    "although the expressions of the recursive equations become quite involved after few iterations , this provides one with a systematic way to compute @xmath70 corrections .",
    "the cosmological equations are simply obtained by placing the expressions from ( [ abdef ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) , ( [ eqq1 ] ) and ( [ eqq2 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that of the three equations ( [ eq0 ] ) , ( [ eqq1 ] ) and ( [ eqq2 ] ) only two are independent due to the bianchi identities .",
    "thus , one has two evolution equations for the scale factors @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , the ideal scenario is the one in which , without neither fine tunings nor violations of `` naturalness '' , one gets @xmath71 since in this way the theory would approach for late time to an effective four dimensional universe with small compact extra dimensions .",
    "we leave the complete description of all possible regimes and their abundance to a separate paper , here we state that this scenario is present in a case with negative discriminant of ( [ polynomial ] ) ( so that @xmath72 ( [ leff ] ) is imaginary ) and negative curvature of the extra dimensions ( @xmath73 regardless of the @xmath74 ) .    to the best of authors",
    "knowledge this is the first time that a dynamical compactification in which the size of extra dimensions approaches to a constant while the three macroscopic extra dimensions expand has been achieved without fine tunings or ad hoc matter fields .",
    "finally , let us describe the region on the @xmath75 parameters space which satisfy both the condition for @xmath72 to be imaginary and the condition for effective newton constant @xmath76 to be positive .",
    "so the system of inequalities is ( we put @xmath77 since only this choice gives us `` well - behaved '' regime )    @xmath78     space which corresponds to the requirements of the positivity of the effective newton constant and negativity of the discriminant of ( [ polynomial ] ) is represented as double - dashed region .",
    "the ( a ) panel corresponds to the @xmath79 case while ( b ) panel  to the @xmath80 ( see text for details).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we plot these two inequalities in the @xmath81 coordinates in fig .",
    "[ region ] .",
    "there we dashed with different inclinations each of ( [ region1 ] ) conditions so that double - dashed region corresponds to the case where both of them satisfied . in ( a ) panel we presented the data for @xmath79 case while in the ( b ) panel  for @xmath80 .",
    "the coordinates for the @xmath82 point are : @xmath83 , @xmath84  it is true for both panels since the sign for @xmath12 is different in them .",
    "so that one can see that in @xmath79 case the area for possible @xmath81 is compact while in @xmath80 it is noncompact .",
    "let us note also that `` classical value '' for @xmath12 is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is `` classical '' cosmological constant , so that the negative value for @xmath12 is favored both by noncompactness of the corresponding region and by `` classical argumentation '' .      in this subsection",
    "let us analyze the late - time behavior of the system .",
    "here we apply the late - time asymptotic of the region which we are interested in ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . before giving the equations themselves ,",
    "let us note one thing ",
    "there are two main late - time regimes from the extra dimensions perspective ",
    "one with @xmath89 and so @xmath90 and the other is @xmath91 and so @xmath92 . obviously , the latter of them is just flat case , while former involves curvature .",
    "the same is true for @xmath4 as well  if we impose nonzero curvature on it , the only difference would be appearance of the regime with @xmath93 with @xmath94 , which obviously contradicts cosmological data .",
    "so , with @xmath87 , @xmath88 ansatz , equations ( [ eq0])([eqq2 ] ) take a form :    @xmath95    @xmath96    where we put @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it appears that ( [ late1 ] ) corresponds to both @xmath59 and @xmath60  rather , we have @xmath99 since there is no dynamics in extra dimensions ; ( [ late2 ] ) corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "system ( [ late1])([late2 ] ) could be further simplified to one fourth - order equation with respect to @xmath100 , but can not be generally solved .",
    "numerically we verified that for wide range of @xmath101 that gives imaginary @xmath72 there are solutions of ( [ late1])([late2 ] ) with @xmath102 ( it must holds since @xmath103 ) and only @xmath104 , which gives @xmath105 .      in this subsection",
    "we want to check the stability of the solution @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "so we perturbed it as @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and substitute them into ( [ eq0])([eqq2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting system could be brought to one second - order equation with respect to @xmath108 :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 are very nasty polynomial coefficients . due to the nature of the coefficients",
    ", it is almost impossible to study them analytically , so we solved ( [ stab ] ) numerically .",
    "our numerical study revealed that the solution is stable for a wide range of the parameters and the initial conditions which lead the @xmath87 , @xmath88 solution .",
    "but in the large @xmath26 limit ( [ stab ] ) behave in a interesting way : we have @xmath111 while @xmath112 which implies that with increase of @xmath26 the solution becomes more stable .",
    "one can make a mechanical analogy with excitation of a massive string ",
    "increasing mass of the string makes it more difficult to excite it .",
    "the large @xmath26 limit general relativity in the context of compactification has been also studied in @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath26 limit in the context of lovelock gravity has been studied in @xcite . in both cases",
    "it is manifest that the large @xmath26 limit improves the behavior of the theory .",
    "here we have confirmed that in this limit the stability of the dynamical compactification regime improves as well .",
    "in this paper it has been shown that egb gravity gives rise to dynamical compactification in which an initially @xmath21 universe evolves towards a @xmath27 universe in which the size of the extra dimensions are much smaller than the size of the non - compact ones .",
    "we have investigated numerically the system under consideration and found that a phenomenologically realistic scenario happens for open region of the couplings space @xmath75 where the theory does not admit a maximally symmetric vacuum solution .",
    "this scenario can therefore be interpreted as symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "remarkably this scenario does not require neither fine - tunings nor violations of `` naturalness hypothesis '' . independently of the sign of the curvature of the three dimensional space section",
    "the curvature of the extra dimensional space must be negative .    as we mentioned in the introduction , the similar result ",
    "the dynamical compactification without violation of `` naturaless ''  was proposed in @xcite for the ( 5 + 1)-dimensional egb theory .",
    "as one can see , our setup is different from the one used in @xcite  we considered both @xmath6 and @xmath4 as manifolds with constant and possibly nonzero curvature , which gives a rise to additional curvature terms and , as a consequence , to a new regime .",
    "additionally , we considered all possible geometrical terms , including the boundary term ( @xmath113 ) , which also affects the dynamics .",
    "overall , despite the fact that in both cases  in @xcite and in our paper  we can see dynamical compactification , it is brought by different phenomena . in our case it is geometric frustration , which is brought by a combination of nonzero curvature and nonzero boundary term  both of them are usually omitted from consideration since they complicate the equations a lot .",
    "but one can see that if you consider such thems , new beautiful regimes could appear ; in that sence our paper holds some methodological character as well .    in the analysis of the dynamical compactification we have supposed the torsion to be zero .",
    "however in first order formalism the equations of motion of egb gravity do not imply the vanishing of torsion which is therefore a propagating degree of freedom . to study its effects in the context of dynamical compactification",
    "will be object of future investigation .",
    "egb gravity is the simplest generalization of general relativity within the class of lovelock gravity . as we considered an arbitrary number of extra dimensions it would also be interesting to study the effect of higher order lovelock terms in the compactification mechanism .",
    "the results obtained in this paper suggest that the effects of higher terms depend sensibly on the fact if the highest curvature power is even as only in this case there exist a region in the parameter space admits no maximally symmetric solution .    _",
