    "peculiar velocities distort the maps of the galaxy distribution when redshifts are used as a measure of distance through the hubble relation .",
    "the observed distortions contain important information on the statistical properties of the large  scale motions of galaxies , presumably due to the gravitational influence of the true underlying mass distribution .",
    "in particular , the two  point correlation function in redshift space @xmath12 differs from that in real space  in two respects : on small scales correlations are suppressed due to the virialized motions in rich clusters , which in redshift space elongate structures along the line of sight ; on large scales coherent motions produced by infall into overdense regions or by outflow out of underdense regions enhance correlations .",
    "galaxies of different morphological types inhabit different environments , following a well  established morphology  density relation ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "they display significantly different clustering properties ( davis & geller 1976 ; giovanelli , haynes & chincarini 1986 ; iovino 1993 ; loveday  1995 ; hermit  1996 ) : ellipticals and s0 s dominate dense cluster cores and are therefore more clustered than spirals and irregulars .",
    "however , their association with the deep potential wells of clusters implies that they have higher peculiar velocities on average , so that the small  scale @xmath12 for early - type galaxies is more strongly suppressed with respect to  than for late types .",
    "the consequence is that a correct comparison of the clustering properties of different morphological types requires understanding in detail their respective redshift space distortions .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is to measure the angular correlation function @xmath13 on two  dimensional catalogues ( giovanelli 1986 ; loveday  1995 . ] ) .",
    "the effects of redshift space distortions also need to be quantified in comparing the angular clustering of distant objects with the clustering in redshift space of galaxies at low redshift ( e.g. , iovino  1996 ) .",
    "the standard way to quantify redshift distortions is to split the separation vector of a pair of objects into components lying on the plane of the sky , @xmath14 , and along the line of sight , @xmath15 , and to compute the correlation function  as a function of these two components .",
    "the iso  correlation contours of  will be stretched along the @xmath15 direction at small separations , due to the effect of large velocity dispersions , and compressed at large scales , as a consequence of large - scale coherent motions .",
    "projecting  onto the @xmath14 axis gives the projected function @xmath16 , which is independent of redshift distortions and can be directly expressed as an integral over the real  space correlation function @xmath17 .",
    "the equation relating @xmath16 and @xmath17 thus allows one to recover the latter via direct inversion or modelling .    on the other hand",
    ", modelling the distortions of  allows one to characterize the pairwise velocity distribution function .",
    "we are particularly concerned with the second moment of this distribution function , @xmath18 , in this paper .",
    "davis & peebles ( 1983 , hereafter @xcite ) used the cfa1 survey ( @xcite ) to measure 1 , the value of @xmath18 at @xmath19 , to be @xmath20 . while the analysis of the  1.2 jy redshift survey by fisher  ( 1994b , hereafter @xcite ) produced a similar result , @xmath21 , re  analyses of the cfa1 survey ( @xcite ) , and of larger optical redshift surveys have shown a large range of values , going as high as @xmath22 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 is found to be quite sensitive to the presence or absence of one or two rich clusters , even in volumes as large as the cfa2 .",
    "it seems plausible that while the cfa1 value was strongly affected by the smallness of the volume surveyed , that measured from the  1.2 jy survey reflects the specific nature of  galaxies , which are mostly star - forming , late - type galaxies which are under - represented in rich clusters relative to optically selected galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the case of  galaxies explicitly illustrates the dangers of using a specific class of objects to draw conclusions on statistics of the velocity field , in particular at small separations : the answer depends sensitively on the morphological type of the tracer we are using .",
    "this paper addresses this issue in detail : 1 ) what is the difference in the clustering strength of early and late  type galaxies measured in real space ?",
    "2 ) what is the small  scale velocity dispersion for the two classes of objects ?    the outline of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : data ] , we present the data we will use for our analyses .",
    "we discuss the measurement of  in   [ sec : estimating - xi ] , and present our results in   [ sec : xip ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   [ sec : summary ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the pp19 sample ,  is quite insensitive to @xmath23 in the range @xmath24 for @xmath25 . for larger values of @xmath14 ,",
    "is in fact fairly sensitive to @xmath23 , but since we are primarily interested in the redshift distortions on small scales , this has no effect on our result .",
    "the observed  and the best  fit power law for the complete samples are shown in figure  [ wpfit_vlim ] , together with likelihood contours on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while the results of the fits are reported in table  [ wpfit_tab ] .",
    "note how well the power ",
    "law model fits the data is an integral over @xmath17 , and therefore small deviations from the power  law model in the latter function are averaged out in the former . ] .",
    "error bars are given by the scatter over 100 bootstrap realizations and the fit is performed as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ml ] .",
    "there is evidence of a growth of the correlation length with increasing sample depth and intrinsic luminosity .",
    "this is most significant ( @xmath28 ) between pp19 and pp19.5 ; @xmath26 does not grow significantly between pp19.5 and pp20 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results of iovino  ( 1993 ) using a previous version of this sample , and the results of loveday  ( 1995 ) on the apm ",
    "stromlo redshift survey , but is in contrast with hamilton ( 1988 ) , who found that the luminosity dependence of @xmath26 was most significant at the highest luminosities .",
    "table  [ wpfit_tab ] also shows a similar trend for the spiral  only samples .",
    "thus even within morphological classes , a luminosity dependence of clustering does exist ( iovino  1993 ; cf .",
    ", their figure  12 ) .",
    "we have checked the sensitivity of these results to magnitude errors at the faint end by cutting the pp19 , pp19.5 and pp20 samples at a corrected magnitude @xmath29 , and re  computing , @xmath16 and the best fit with a power  law .",
    "this is a fairly conservative selection , reducing each of the three subsamples by @xmath30 in number ( to 882 , 740 and 503 galaxies respectively ) .",
    "for these three samples , we obtain the following estimates for ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) : ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , and ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , respectively .",
    "comparison of these values with those in table  [ wpfit_tab ] shows that the results are very robust and that our conclusions are unaffected by any magnitude bias affecting the faint end of the zwicky catalogue .",
    "figure  [ wpfit_types ] shows one of our principal results , the relative clustering strength of early and late  type galaxies , as described by the real  space correlation function .",
    "both the slope and correlation length are significantly different in the two samples ( table  [ wpfit_tab ] ) .    the scale dependence of the relative bias @xmath37 of early to late  type galaxies is then simply : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the value at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we find @xmath42 , where the error bars have been computed using standard error propagation . at @xmath43 , we find @xmath44 .",
    "hermit  ( 1996 ) compute a similar relative bias factor from the optical redshift survey ( santiago  1995 ) , but in redshift space , finding an average value @xmath45 between 1 and @xmath46 .",
    "their analysis does not take into account the differences in redshift ",
    "space distortions between the two classes of galaxies that we have stressed here .",
    "loveday  ( 1995 ) use both the apm catalogue and the sparsely  sampled subsets of galaxies that form the apm ",
    "stromlo redshift survey ; inverting the angular correlation function @xmath13 for two subsamples limited to @xmath47 they find @xmath48 , @xmath49 for early - type galaxies and @xmath50 , @xmath51 for late - type galaxies .",
    "this is in good agreement with our direct estimates from the spatial function .",
    "however , the apm ",
    "stromlo data are too sparse for being able to compute  directly from the morphological subsamples , so that an estimate of the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath18 can not be obtained .",
    "the correlation length we find for all spiral galaxies is significantly larger than that of  galaxies in the 1.2 jy redshift survey , @xmath52 , while the slope @xmath53 is similar .",
    "this has the interesting implication that the relative bias of spiral galaxies to selected galaxies is independent of scale , at least below 10 .",
    "since  galaxies tend to be of type sb and later , we have defined a volume - limited sample to @xmath54 , containing 321 galaxies with types between sb and irr .",
    "in fact , for these we find a lower correlation length , @xmath55 , and a similar logarithmic slope , @xmath56 , in excellent agreement with galaxies .      the quantity  can be expressed as an integral over the product of the real - space correlation function @xmath17 , and the distribution function of the line  of  sight components @xmath57 of relative velocities for pairs with separation @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( @xcite ) if @xmath60 is the component of @xmath58 along the line of sight , then @xmath61 and the integral can be written as ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath62\\right\\}\\,f\\left[h_0 ( \\pi - y)|r\\right ] \\,\\,\\ , . \\label{conv1}\\ ] ] this expression gives a _ description _ of the effect of a peculiar velocity field on @xmath17 , but does not represent a self  consistent dynamical treatment of the density and velocity fields , which are clearly interdependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "we do not have any _ a priori _ information , therefore , on the functional form of the distribution function @xmath63 .",
    "peebles ( 1976 ) first showed that an exponential distribution best fits the observed data , a result subsequently confirmed by @xmath64body models ( e.g. , zurek  1994 ) .",
    "with such a choice , eq .",
    "( [ conv1 ] ) becomes @xmath65\\,{1\\over \\sqrt{2 } \\sigma_{12}(r)}\\,{\\rm exp}\\left\\ { -\\sqrt{2}h_0   \\left|{\\pi - y\\left[1+{v_{12}(r ) \\over",

    "@xcite show that it is very difficult to model the dependence of @xmath68 on the separation @xmath58 .",
    "this is made particularly difficult in our case ; our sample covers too small a volume to allow a determination of the large - scale streaming from the compression of the contours of  ( cf . ,   [ xp - shape ] ) . for this reason , we do not follow @xcite in a detailed analysis of the mean streaming , and instead , we limit ourselves to the simple streaming model introduced by @xcite , based on the similarity solution of the bbgky equations : @xmath69 we wish to fit eq .",
    "( [ xp_model ] ) to the observed  to constrain @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in particular in @xmath11 , the pairwise velocity dispersion for scales smaller than 1 , and thus we carry out all fits to the quantity @xmath70 following @xcite differs from that of @xcite by an unimportant normalization factor  cf . , their eq .",
    "( 7 ) . ] . in practice , because we have calculated  in 1  bins , @xmath71 is simply the value of  in the first bin of @xmath14 . we assume further that @xmath18 is a weak function of separation @xmath58 ( @xcite ) , so that it can be treated as a single free parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ xpfit_types_01 ] shows the results of two  parameter fits of the model of eqs .",
    "( [ xp_model ] ) and ( [ eq : v12 ] ) to @xmath71 for the e19.5 and s19.5 subsamples .",
    "we use the best - fit values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 from table  [ wpfit_tab ] appropriate for each subsample ; errors and covariances of @xmath71 are calculated consistently , as described in ",
    "[ sec : ml ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath72 is very poorly constrained by these data ( figure  [ xpfit_types_01 ] ) : the free - streaming on these small scales is quite small .",
    "we therefore estimate 1  for the two cases @xmath73 ( free expansion of pairs with the hubble flow ) , and @xmath74 ( stable clustering ) .",
    "this second case is most probably the one closer to a realistic model : jain ( 1996 ) shows that the stable clustering hypothesis ( @xmath74 ) should be a good approximation at the present epoch for scales of the order of , or smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "we thus use the values with @xmath76 in our discussion below .",
    "the value of 1  is of order 800  for pp19 and pp19.5 , but drops below @xmath77 for pp20 , consistent with the more isotropic contours of  for this case ( figure  [ xipi_second ] ) .",
    "we interpret this as due to the smaller effect rich clusters , and in particular the perseus cluster , have on the larger volume of pp20 , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "notice the very significant factor of two difference between the 1  for early and late  type galaxies at @xmath78 , a dramatic indication of the effect of cluster cores on the determination of 1 .",
    "we now turn to a direct demonstration of the sensitivity of 1  to the presence of rich clusters in the sample .",
    "marzke  ( 1995 ) have discussed in detail the effect of the contribution of cluster galaxies to the small  scale pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion is a pair - weighted statistic , and thus it is heavily weighted in regions of high density , i.e. , clusters .",
    "because galaxies in clusters have an intrinsically high velocity dispersion , the inclusion or exclusion of clusters can have a dramatic effect on @xmath79 .",
    "marzke  showed that the estimates of @xmath18 fluctuate from one sample to the other due to the significant variations in the number of clusters even over volumes as large as those of the cfa2 and ssrs2 surveys .",
    "guzzo  ( 1996 ) showed that 1  dropped from @xmath80 to @xmath81 in pp19 , after removing the perseus cluster .",
    "thus the removal of a single dominant cluster can significantly affect the pairwise velocity dispersion . here",
    "we explore further the stability of @xmath11 , in the case of spiral galaxies . using spiral  only samples , we are in practice filtering out the high  density non  linear regions that would otherwise get such high weight in @xmath11 . the result of excluding the perseus cluster from the pp19.5 sample is visually shown by the changes in in the two top panels of figure  [ xi4_spir ] .",
    "the differences between the contours in the two panels [ and the corresponding values of @xmath11 , reported in table  [ sigma_tab ] ] , can be compared to those produced by the same operation on the s19.5 sample ( bottom ) . while the effect on pp19.5 is relevant [ although less dramatic than it was found for pp19 by guzzo  ( 1996 ) for pp19 , due to the larger volume and the consequent reduced weight of the perseus cluster ] , the two bottom panels of figure  [ xi4_spir ] are virtually identical , and so are the estimated 1  .",
    "table  [ sigma_tab ] also gives @xmath11 for spiral samples limited to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "table  [ sigma_tab ] indicates that 1  for spirals lies consistently between 300 and 350 .",
    "this agrees with the @xcite value for  galaxies @xmath82 , the @xcite value for galaxies outside of @xmath83 abell clusters @xmath84 , and the original determination by @xcite , which undersampled the virgo cluster in cfa1 ( somerville , davis & primack 1997 ) .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the similarity of 1  for spiral and  galaxies , in the light of their different correlation lengths ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively ) .",
    "galaxies are mostly late  type spirals , and indeed we showed above that if we compute @xmath17 for this subclass , we recover @xmath87 , in agreement with  galaxies ( cf . ,",
    "giovanelli , haynes & chincarini 1986 , and iovino  1993 , who showed that there is a continuity in the clustering strength within the spiral class , with sc s being less clustered than sa s ) .",
    "the similar value of 1 , on the other hand , may simply indicate that the dynamics of   galaxies and all spirals are governed by the same fluctuations in the underlying matter density field .",
    "indeed , 1  for galaxies of type sb and later is found to be @xmath88 , in statistical agreement with the spiral sample as a whole .",
    "the main conclusions we have reached in this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we see very strong small  scale redshift - space distortions in the perseus ",
    "pisces redshift survey .",
    "the distortions are much stronger for early  type galaxies , as one would expect from the segregation of morphological types .",
    "* we confirm a mild luminosity dependence of clustering for absolute magnitudes around the knee of the luminosity function , @xmath89 : the correlation length increases from @xmath90 for @xmath91 to @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than the `` canonical '' value of the correlation length based on the @xcite analysis of the cfa1 survey , @xmath94 .",
    "this latter value is confirmed by the analysis of the eso slice project ( esp ) survey ( bartlett  1997 ) , that yields @xmath95 , while the las campanas survey ( lin 1995 ) , gives @xmath96 . there are probably two reasons for the higher values of @xmath26 measured here .",
    "first , the `` standard '' values quoted above are estimates of @xmath17 performed on apparent  magnitude  limited samples .",
    "if there is , as we have seen , a mild luminosity dependence of clustering , samples that are volume  limited at relatively bright absolute magnitudes will systematically measure a higher clustering signal .",
    "second , the perseus ",
    "pisces area is rather rich in clusters of galaxies , so that it probably over  emphasizes the cluster contribution to @xmath17 . for comparison",
    ", the richest cluster in the cfa1 volume is the virgo cluster .",
    "the cfa2+ssrs2 sample ( marzke  1995 ) covers part of the pp area and thus has a higher contribution of clusters , resulting in @xmath97 . *",
    "a meaningful comparison of the relative clustering strength of spirals and ellipticals can be performed only in real space , i.e. after correcting for the effect of differential redshift space distortions .",
    "a power  law shape , @xmath98 , is a good representation of the real  space correlation function between 1 and @xmath99 for both ellipticals and spirals .",
    "fit estimate of the power  law parameters gives @xmath100 , @xmath1 for ellipticals , and @xmath101 , @xmath3 for spirals .",
    "we model the relative bias of the two types of galaxies as a power law with a mild dependence on scale , @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , we confirm the continuous variation of clustering strength also within the spiral class . for late  type spirals ( sb and later ) , and irregulars",
    ", we estimate @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , virtually the same correlation function as  galaxies . *",
    "the quantity 1 , the measured pairwise velocity dispersion between 0 and @xmath8 , varies considerably between samples of different volumes , going from @xmath103 of pp19 , to @xmath104 for pp20 .",
    "this variation is consistent with the smallness of the volume sampled .",
    "* the difference in the measured 1  between early and late  type galaxies is remarkable .",
    "we estimate @xmath105 for ellipticals and @xmath106 for spirals .",
    "contrary to results for the combined sample , the value of 1  for spiral galaxies alone is stable to both changes in the sample volume and the presence of rich clusters . the consistency of this value with those measured for non  cluster galaxies ( marzke  1995 ) and  galaxies ( @xcite ) , and the stability among spiral subclasses ( for sb and later types we measure @xmath88 ) , suggests that a value 1  in the range 300  @xmath107 is a good estimate of the `` temperature '' of the galaxy flow outside of virialized structures .",
