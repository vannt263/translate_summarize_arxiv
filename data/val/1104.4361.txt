    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in iron - based compounds@xcite a lot of research has been dedicated to this fascinating class of materials . on the theoretical side ,",
    "calculations within density - functional theory ( dft ) , often performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) , could reproduce a variety of properties , but failed in the quantitative description of other features , such as the mass renormalization of the predominately iron-@xmath3 quasi - particles , which could be improved by the inclusion of correlation effects for the fe 3d electrons.@xcite a very puzzling mystery shows up for the compounds exhibiting long - range spin - density - wave ( sdw ) magnetic ordering at low temperatures .",
    "although the spin - pattern and ordering vectors were well predicted by dft , it was soon realized that there is a big discrepancy between the magnitude of the measured magnetic moments with theoretical predictions of spin - polarized dft calculations .",
    "for instance for lafeaso , early experimental data pointed to a very small ordered moment in the range of range of around 0.3@xmath2,@xcite although recent measurements indicated a somewhat larger moment of 0.63@xmath2 in lafeaso.@xcite on the other hand , dft calculations using the experimental crystal structure always gives large values between 1.7 and more than 2@xmath2.@xcite    there is also a strong connection between the value of the ordered moment and details of the crystal structure .",
    "as stated above , the ordered moment turns out to be too large in dft calculations , but in this magnetic case , structural optimization of the @xmath0-position of the arsenic ions reproduces well the experimental position.@xcite on the other hand , non - magnetic dft calculations , which should correspond to the paramagnetic high - temperature phase , gives a too short fe - as distance with drastic influence on the low - energy electronic structure.@xcite experimentally , the as @xmath0 position hardly changes across the magnetic transition,@xcite a fact that is hard to reconcile within dft calculations , since the optimized internal structural parameters differ significantly between magnetic and non - magnetic calculations .",
    "the correct description of the equilibrium structure is particularly important for cases where the forces on the ions are important , e.g. phonon calculations .",
    "there were several attempts to improve over simple dft calculations .",
    "concerning the ordered moment , yildirim _",
    "et al._@xcite performed fixed moment dft calculations in order to study the stability of magnetic ordering patterns .",
    "attempts to include correlation effects by performing lda+u or gga+u calculations were not successful .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the magnetic moment even _ increases _ with increasing @xmath4 , and even for small interaction values of @xmath5ev the topology of the fermi surfaces is changed drastically , incompatible with experiments .",
    "however , a reduction of the magnetic moment could be found in lda+u calculation using an effective _ negative _ interaction parameter.@xcite particularly promising are approaches using many - body techniques to include electronic correlation effects . using a combination of dft with the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) a significant reduction of the magnetic moment",
    "could be found for bafe2as2,@xcite variational monte carlo gave similar results also for other materials,@xcite consistent with a recent comprehensive lda+dmft study for a variety of pnictide and chalcogenide materials.@xcite a general argument is that quantum fluctuations hinder a large instantaneous iron moment from ordering.@xcite    regarding the combination of structural and magnetic properties , one proposal for a better description is to combine in a sophisticated way magnetic and non - magnetic dft calculations.@xcite this approach has been used to study the electron - phonon interaction in iron - pnictide superconductors . improved structural optimization has been performed using a combination of dft with gutzwiller wave function techniques,@xcite where the values of the interaction parameters where fitted to give the correct as height above the fe plane .    the motivation for this article is to show that the inclusion of correlation effects by lda+dmft for the description of lafeaso improves substantially the agreement of both the as @xmath0 position as well as the ordered magnetic moment between theory and experiment within one set of _ ab - initio _ calculated interaction parameters , which are determined with the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa).@xcite this kind of investigation has not been done so far , since theoretical studies including strong electron - correlations were focused on the calculation of _ either _ magnetic@xcite _ or _",
    "structural properties.@xcite    a consistent approach to total energy calculations and structural optimization within lda+dmft ( the as @xmath0 position in lafeaso in the present work ) requires self - consistency over the charge density .",
    "lda+dmft is often employed within the so - called `` one - shot '' scheme , where the one - electron part of the hamiltonian obtained from the band - structure lda part is not updated during subsequent dmft calculations .",
    "however , correlation effects will in general induce a certain redistribution of the charge density , which in turn leads to different kohn - sham potential and one - particle part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the correlation - induced changes in the charge density and one - electron potential will also affect the electron - nuclei , hartree , and exchange - correlation contributions to the lda+dmft total energy .",
    "moreover , in some systems ( e.g. cerium oxides @xcite ) the charge density self - consistency has been demonstrated to be important for spectral properties as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : method ] we introduce the full charge - self consistent lda+dmft method , followed by sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] where we present results for the lafeaso system .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sect .  [",
    "sect : conclusions ] , which are followed by app .",
    "[ sect : appendix ] with a more detailed discussion of the influence of the full charge self - consistency on the single - particle spectra .",
    "for the present study , we use a further development of a previously introduced lda+dmft implementation , ref .  , which is based on the full potential ( linearized ) augmented plane wave method as implemented in the wien2k package.@xcite our task of optimizing the arsenic ion position necessitates rather accurate calculations of the total energy , which , as explained in the sec .",
    "[ sect : intro ] , require a lda+dmft scheme fully self - consistent in the charge density .",
    "the implementation of full charge self - consistency is currently a topic of high interest , and several schemes have been implemented recently.@xcite    within the projective technique for formation of the correlated orbitals , ref .",
    ", we use the kohn - sham ( ks ) states within a chosen energy window @xmath6 to form wannier - like functions that are treated as correlated orbitals . in the present work ,",
    "we use an energy window from @xmath7ev to @xmath8ev , spanning the range of fe - d as well as as - p and o - p states , giving a total number of 22 bands inside the window .",
    "onsite interactions were then applied to the five fe - d orbitals .",
    "the very same projection scheme has already been used in ref .  .",
    "solving the corresponding single - site quantum impurity problem produces the local self - energy within the correlated orbitals basis set , which is then upfolded into the lattice self - energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are matsubara fermionic frequencies .",
    "the lattice self - energy @xmath11 is generally non - diagonal in the subspace of the ks eigenstates @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) leading to a non - diagonal lattice green s function within @xmath6 and to the corresponding density matrix :    @xmath14    being also non - diagonal .",
    "the charge density distribution in the real space is then calculated from the density matrix @xmath15 as follows :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are the ks eigenstates within the energy window @xmath6 , @xmath18 is the contribution from states outside @xmath6 . by substituting into ( [ rho_general_dmft ] ) the expansion of the ks eigenstates within the linear augmented plain - wave ( lapw ) basis set",
    "one derives formulas for the charge density within the muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres and in the interstitial .",
    "these formulate are generalizations of the standard lapw expressions to the case of a density matrix non - diagonal in the space of ks states . as in the standard case",
    ", the charge density within the mt spheres is expressed through radial solutions ( and their energy derivatives ) of the corresponding schrdinger equation . in the interstitial it is expressed through plain waves .",
    "the derivation and relevant formulas for each case are given in appendix [ sect : appendix_chd ] .    the lda+dmft total energy reads@xcite @xmath19+e_h[\\rho_{dmft}]+ \\\\   & e_{xc}[\\rho_{dmft } ]   + \\bra h_u \\ket - e_{dc } ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the corresponding contributions in the right - hand side are the kinetic , crystal ( electron - nuclei and nuclei - nuclei ) , hartree , exchange - correlation , hubbard and double - counting correction terms , respectively .",
    "the second , third and four terms are evaluated in accordance to the standard dft - lda expressions but with the updated lda+dmft charge density ( [ rho_general_dmft ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy contribution reads @xmath20 where the kohn - sham potential @xmath21 corresponds to the lda+dmft charge density @xmath22 and the band energy contribution @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the one - particle ( kohn - sham ) part of the hamiltonian , @xmath26 are its eigenstates with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the sum over the occupied kohn - sham eigenstates laying outside of the window @xmath6 .",
    "finally , the hubbard term @xmath29 was evaluated in accordance with the migdal formula @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the impurity self - energy and green function , respectively .",
    "for the solution of the quantum impurity problem we apply the continuous - time quantum monte carlo method in the strong - coupling formulation.@xcite restricting ourselves to density - density interactions only , as in ref .  , we are able to perform calculations down to temperatures as low as @xmath33k with reasonable numerical effort and without further approximations . for the calculation of total energies ,",
    "high - quality numerical data is necessary . in order to get an estimate of the statistical error on the total energy , we perform several further iterations ( order 10 ) after self - consistency",
    "is reached , yielding an estimate for the standard deviation .",
    "interaction parameters have been calculated previously within crpa@xcite , yielding an average coulomb interaction of @xmath34ev and hund s exchange of @xmath35ev . for details of this calculation",
    "we refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "as mentioned above , a double - counting correction has to be applied in order to subtract the contribution to the correlation energy already included in the lda .",
    "several forms have been proposed , we will apply the two most common approximations , which are the around - mean - field ( amf ) and the full - localized - limit ( fll ) forms , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total electronic charge of the impurity problem , @xmath38 its spin - dependent value , and @xmath39 the charge per spin and orbital . for the corresponding double counting energies one can find@xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 the orbital quantum number for @xmath42 electrons .",

    "interestingly , the choice of the double - counting correction , although having almost no effect on the single - particle spectra ( see below , sect  [ sect : appendix ] ) , has some visible effect on the total energy .",
    "this is most likely due to the very small energy scales that one has to deal with in these structure optimizations , where already tiny differences can visibly show up .",
    "nevertheless , using the amf double counting , the as @xmath0 position as determined in lda calculations ( @xmath52 ) is corrected to around @xmath53 , which has to be compared with the experimental value of @xmath54 .",
    "we attribute the larger distance of the as ion from the iron plane to the fact that in dmft calculations the ground state of the iron atom is the s=2 high spin state , having slightly larger ionic radius then the non - magnetic state realized in non - magnetic lda calculations .",
    "the small discrepancy that we still see between our calculated @xmath0 values and experimental data is most likely due to the neglection of coulomb interactions between the iron and arsenic ions ( @xmath55-@xmath3 interactions ) .",
    "it is a very common feature of lda calculations , that the gap between valence bands and ligand bands is too small .",
    "comparing calculated band structure of lafeaso with pes experiments , the discrepancy is about 1ev.@xcite in one - shot lda+dmft calculations this gap can artificially be influenced by manually chosen double - counting corrections , which is not the case for full self - consistent calculations ( see below , sect .",
    "[ sect : appendix ] ) .",
    "the correction of this gap would only be possible by the explicit inclusion of @xmath55-@xmath3 interactions , giving also a repulsion between iron and arsenic ions .",

    "the instantaneous magnetic moment ( equal - time correlation function ) is large , roughly 1.95@xmath2 .",
    "however , when looking at the ordered moment at low - temperatures , the situation is different . to study",
    "the _ ordered _ moment at low temperatures , we performed lda+dmft calculations allowing for spin polarization at @xmath57k , which is well below the magnetic transition temperature of @xmath58k .",
    "as magnetic order pattern we assumed the stripe sdw pattern , as suggested by lsda calculations as well as experiments .",
    "in order to keep calculations as feasible as possible , we used ferromagnetic instead of antiferromagnetic stacking in @xmath59-direction , but since the distance of the iron layers is very large , this approximation is well justified .",
    "we used the orthorhombic low - temperature unit cell as given in ref .",
    ", with ferromagnetic chains running along the short bonds in the @xmath60 plane .",
    "doing so , we find an ordered moment of @xmath61@xmath2 , significantly smaller than our lsda value of @xmath62@xmath2 . the value of the magnetic ordered moment is almost converged in temperature , since calculations for @xmath33k give only slightly larger moments of @xmath63@xmath2 . in a recent comprehensive lda+dmft study a value of @xmath64@xmath2was reported for lafeaso,@xcite the difference in the two results coming from the larger interaction values @xmath65 and @xmath66 used in ref .",
    "( an estimate on the variation of the magnetic moment as function of parameters has been given in ref .  ) .",
    "for comparison , in the first lda+dmft study of the ordered magnetic moment,@xcite done for bafe@xmath67as@xmath67 , a similar reduction of the magnetic moment to @xmath68@xmath2 has been found .",
    "the temporal fluctuations , which are very strong in the lafeaso compound due to its quite itinerant nature , hinder the instantaneous moments from complete ordering , leaving only a fraction of the moment in the ordered state .",
    "similar arguments have been given for the reduction of the moment in ref .  .",
    "our findings are in qualitative agreement with a recent study on the quenching of the magnetic moment.@xcite however , the former study has been done in the _ paramagnetic _ phase , focusing on the influence of local quantum fluctuations on the local moment .",

    "[ fig : dos ] , where we plot the momentum integrated spectral function for the fe 3d electrons .",
    "real frequency data has been obtained by using the stochastic maximum entropy method.@xcite in lsda the splitting between majority and minority spins is large , whereas we see only a small gap in the lda+dmft spectra due to the smaller moment .",
    "in this paper , we presented an extension of the previously introduced lda+dmft approach@xcite based on the augmented linearized plane wave basis to full charge self - consistency , and applied this approach to structural and magnetic properties of the iron superconductor lafeaso .",
    "we calculated the total energy as function of the pnictogen height , and found that the inclusion of correlation effects shift the minimum position from @xmath69 to roughly @xmath70 , a much better agreement with the experimental value of @xmath54 .",
    "this increased distance of the as ion from the fe plane is due to the high spin state of iron , which is formed due to local interactions .",
    "considering the magnetic properties , we calculated the local spin susceptibility and found that it shows very weak temperature dependence in the paramagnetic state , in accordance with enhanced pauli magnetism . in the low-@xmath71 sdw phase , we calculated the ordered moment in the stripe - like antiferromagnetic phase , and found a moment of @xmath72@xmath2 , in much better agreement with experimental values than the lsda value , which can be ( for the experimental crystal structure ) as high as 2@xmath2 .    in summary ,",
