    "neutron or proton rich ) a major problem is to understand how the shell structure evolves from stable to unstable nuclei .",
    "presently there is much concern about the role of the tensor force in the shell evolution and the structure of exotic nuclei @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite we estimated the contribution of the tensor part of the skyrme interaction to the hartree - fock spin - orbit splitting in several magic nuclei and adjusted the strength of the tensor force such as to obtain a good global fit . in the present paper",
    "we extend the previous study to exotic nuclei , most of which were unknown at that time .",

    "contrary to the view that it plays a minor role because of its @xmath3-type structure @xcite , this interaction has the same effect as a finite size interaction due to its momentum dependence .",

    "@xcite have pointed out that the nuclear tensor force has a rather long range and that the use of the energy density ( [ hr ] ) may not be justified .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that expressions ( [ hr ] ) together with ( [ wn ] ) and ( [ wp ] ) , given in section 2 of this paper , can still be used to study the contribution of finite range tensor forces , even if the range is that of the one - pion exchange force .",
    "shell gaps are mainly determined by the spin - orbit splitting of the states with highest @xmath4 in any shell and our study is restricted to these states .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is less important in states with lower @xmath4 because it is hidden by pairing effects and other forms of configuration mixing .    in section 2",
