    "the analysis of the dynamics of the classical fields in black hole spacetimes is necessary to calculate significant physical quantities and in the study of relevant physical phenomena @xcite@xcite , for example , by investigating the dynamics of perturbing fields we can determine the classical stability of the black holes with respect to linear perturbations @xcite@xcite .",

    "hence we can assert that these black holes are stable against klein - gordon and electromagnetic perturbations .",
    "as for the massless dirac field , for the gravitational , electromagnetic , and klein - gordon perturbations the functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 depend on the spacetime dimension , but in contrast to the corresponding functions for the massless dirac field , these functions are proportional to @xmath94 ( defined in the formula ( [ eq : identifications metric functions ] ) ) and they do not depend on the azimuthal number .",
    "thus given the spacetime and its dimension , for all the modes of the field we find only one expression for each of these functions .",
    "we believe that deserves further research to analyze the usefulness of this method to state the classical stability of other black holes .",
    "moreover it is appropriate to extend this work and prove the classical stability of the maximally symmetric black holes ( [ eq : maximally symmetric metric ] ) against massive and charged dirac fields .",

    "<S> in a @xmath0-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetime we simplify the massless dirac equation to two decoupled wavelike equations with effective potentials . furthermore in @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild and schwarzschild de sitter black holes we note that for the massless dirac field moving in the region exterior to the event horizon at least one of the effective potentials is not positive definite </S>",
