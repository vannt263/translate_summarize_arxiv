    "roadways , railways , and airways are the major means of transport in india , although contribution of airways is small compared to that of the other two .",
    "the civil aviation sector in india has been developing steadily and is expected to grow at an accelerated pace with the shift in the policy of the government , and the addition of several low - cost private air service providers  @xcite .",
    "these private players offer competitive pricing , provide more region - oriented service , and thereby help to increase the air traffic .",
    "understanding of these transportation systems is important for reasons of policy , administration and efficiency .    during the past few years",
    ", complex network analysis has been used to study transportation systems ( railways  @xcite , airlines  @xcite ) , which are man - made infrastructures , from different aspects , apart from many other systems of diverse origins  @xcite . the world - wide airport network ( wan ) has been studied from topological as well as traffic dynamics perspective .",
    "wan has been studied  @xcite for its degree distribution and a model with constraints ( such as cost of adding links to the nodes or the limited capacity of nodes ) was proposed to account for the truncation for high - degrees in its scale - free cumulative degree distribution .",
    "it has been observed  @xcite that in wan , most connected nodes are not necessarily the most `` central ''  nodes through which most of the shortest paths go .",
    "a model , incorporating the geo - political constraints , has been proposed  @xcite to explain this apparently surprising result . beyond the topological features , wan",
    "was studied  @xcite in more detail by considering the traffic  strength of interactions between nodes  dynamics on it .",
    "a model was proposed  @xcite for the evolution of weighted evolving networks in an effort to understand the statistical properties of real - world systems .",
    "airport network of china ( anc )  @xcite , a network much smaller than wan , was also analyzed for its topology and traffic dynamics .",
    "its topology was found to be having small - world network features and a two - regime power - law degree distribution .",
    "we investigate india s domestic airport network which comprises air services of all major civil air service providers .",
    "we study the network for its topological features and for its traffic dynamics , by considering the intensity of interactions .",
    "first , we study the network as an `` unweighted network '' to investigate its topological properties .",
    "this network is formed by considering whether or not a pair of airports are connected by an airline . as in many other complex networks , the details of flow of information",
    "is a crucial factor for airport networks .",
    "hence we study `` weighted network '' , in which we consider the number of flights plying between any two airports per week .",
    "`` unweighted network '' represents the architecture ( topology ) of airports connectivity , whereas `` weighted network '' represents traffic dynamics in the network .",
    "our analysis shows that while ani is similar to the wan in some aspects , it has differences in some features as reflected in its network parameters .",
    "we find that ani has small - world  @xcite network features and has a scale - free  @xcite degree distribution .",
    "the traffic in ani is found to be accumulated on interconnected groups of airports and is concentrated on trunk routes between large airports .",
    "it is found to be having a disassortative topology , in contrast to wan .",
    "the airport network of india ( ani ) comprises domestic airports of india and airlines connecting them .",
    "the air services provided in ani include all major domestic air service providers in india , including some international airlines which ply domestic routes .",
    "the data was obtained from a timetable ( excel s timetable for air services within india  ) of neighboring countries in the close vicinity of india . ] , as on 12th january 2004 ) of air services , which includes domestic services provided by following air - travel service providers : indian airlines , alliance air , jet airways , air sahara , air deccan , jagson , druk air , air india , bangladesh biman , royal nepal and srilankan airlines .",
    "the `` unweighted ani '' is a directed network with ( @xmath0= ) 79 nodes ( airports ) and 442 directed links ( flights going from one airport to another ) .",
    "it is represented by a binary adjacency matrix , @xmath1(@xmath2 ) , whose elements @xmath3 take value @xmath4 if there is a flight by any service provider from airport @xmath5 to airport @xmath6 on any day of the week and @xmath7 otherwise .",
    "the asymmetric adjacency matrix ( @xmath1 ) was used to find properties ( in - degrees , out - degrees , and shortest paths ) which are sensitive to the direction .",
    "certain properties ( degrees , degree - correlations , clustering coefficients ) were calculated after symmetrizing the adjacency matrix , which is justified , as out of total @xmath8 flight routes @xmath9 are bi - directional .",
    "we needed to add only 14 fictitious flights so as to symmetrize @xmath1 .",
    "the total number of edges in the symmetrized adjacency matrix is , @xmath10      to include the information about the amount of traffic flowing on the network , the `` weighted ani '' is defined by considering the strengths of the links in terms of number of flights per week .",
    "it is represented by a weight matrix , @xmath11 , where each element @xmath12 stands for the the total number of flights per week from airport @xmath5 to airport @xmath6 .",
    "since majority of the nodes are symmetric in ani , in terms of traffic flowing into and out of it ( @xmath13 ) , we symmetrize the weight matrix @xmath11 which is used for all the weighted analyses .",
    "degree of a node is the number of nodes it is directly connected to .",
    "degree of a node @xmath5 is defined as , @xmath14 in a directed network , in - degree ( out - degree ) of a node is the number of in - coming ( out - going ) links . in ani , in - degree ( @xmath15 ) and out - degree ( @xmath16 ) of an airport stand for the number of flights terminating - into and number of flights originating - from that airport , respectively .",

    "the average clustering coefficient of ani was found to be ( @xmath25= ) @xmath29 , which is an order of magnitude higher than that of the comparable random network ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these two properties indicate that ani is a small - world network .",
    "wan  @xcite and anc  @xcite have also been found to be small - world networks . in particular",

    "we also deduce that the diameter ( defined as the longest of all shortest paths ) of ani is @xmath39 , which means that one needs to change at most @xmath40 flights to reach from any airport to any other airport in ani .    from the passengers point of view , best is as few change of flights as possible , to reach from any airport to any other airport in the network .",
    "though this is an ideal situation for the passengers , it is not economically viable for the air service providers .",

    "[ eq : degree ] , is one of the measures of centrality of a node in the network .",
    "degree symbolizes the importance of a node in the network ",
    "the larger the degree , the more important it is .",
    "the distribution of degrees in a network is an important feature which reflects the topology of the network .",
    "it may shed light on the process by which the network has come into existence .",
    "the networks in which the links between two nodes are assigned randomly have a poisson degree distribution  @xcite with most of the nodes having a typical degree .",
    "a large number of networks ranging from internet to protein - protein interaction network in yeast , have been found  @xcite to be having scale - free degree distributions .",
    "the scale - free distribution , characterized by a power law  , with a scaling exponent @xmath41  can be explained with the help of a growing network model with preferential attachment of the nodes which are being added to the network  @xcite .",
    "since ani is a small network , we analyze the cumulative degree distribution , @xmath42 , whose scaling exponent @xmath43 is related to that of @xmath44 by @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the cumulative degree distribution of ani follows a power law as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cum_degree_dist ] for a wide range of @xmath46 , although it deviates from it for large degrees .",
    "the deviation for large degrees can be attributed to the cost of adding links to nodes or to the limited capacity of nodes . with the help of numerical simulations",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that the cost of adding links leads to a cutoff of the power - law regime for large @xmath46 in the cumulative degree distribution , as is the case with ani .",
    "we find the scaling exponent of ani to be , @xmath47    cumulative degree distribution in ani .",
    "it can be approximated by the power - law fit , @xmath48",
    "we analyzed the weighted ani , by considering the flow of information ( traffic ) on the topology of the network .",
    "the statistical analysis of weights between pairs of nodes indicates the presence of right - skewed distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cum_weights_dist ] .",
    "this shows a high level of heterogeneity in ani , as also found in the case of airport network of china  @xcite and wan  @xcite .",
    "cumulative weights distribution in ani . ]",
    "it has been observed that the individual weights do not provide a general picture of the network s complexity  @xcite .",
    "we use a different measure of importance of a node which considers the flow of information in a network , following barrat et al .",
    "the weighted counterpart of degree , _ strength _",
    "@xmath49 , is defined as , @xmath50 strength of an airport represents total traffic handled by it per week . fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] shows the correlation between degree ( @xmath46 ) and the average strength of vertices with degree @xmath46 , @xmath51 .",
    "we find that @xmath51 increases with @xmath46 as , @xmath52 if the strength and degree of a node were uncorrelated , then @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , which will yield @xmath55 this is an uninteresting case , as in this situation weights do not provide any better information than degrees . for ani , we find that the exponent to be @xmath56 this implies that the strengths of nodes are strongly correlated to their degrees in ani .",
    "larger is an airport , the more traffic it handles , in contrast to what would be expected if the topology and the traffic were uncorrelated .",
    "this feature of ani is similar to that of wan , where it was found that @xmath57",
    "various properties of network are decided , among many other things , by the way the network has evolved , the inherent interdependencies of the nodes , and the architectural constraints .",
    "network parameters are defined so as to be able to capture such features of networks .",
    "we study few such parameters related to the local cohesiveness and connection tendency of nodes , with and without consideration of weights to gain better insight of traffic dynamics on the architecture of ani .",

    ". ]      clustering coefficient as defined in section  [ sec : uw - ani ] , captures the local cohesiveness of a node .",
    "average clustering coefficient ( @xmath25 ) measures the global density of interconnected nodes in the network .",
    "additional information at the intermediate level can be obtained by defining @xmath58 , average clustering coefficient of nodes with degree @xmath46 .",
    "these topological parameters overlook the flow of information on the network and hence may not present correct information about the network dynamics .",
    "the clustering coefficient could be redefined  @xcite , to incorporate the weights of the edges , as , @xmath59 this parameter measures local cohesiveness , by taking into account the interaction intensity found on the local triplets .",
    "the unweighted and weighted clustering coefficients could be compared ( the normalization ensures that @xmath60 ) to assess the tendency of accumulation of traffic on interconnected triplets . weighted clustering coefficients averaged over all nodes ( @xmath61 ) and over all nodes with degree @xmath46 ( @xmath62 )",
    "are defined analogous to their topological counterparts .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that hierarchical networks are expected to have a non - trivial , power - law decay of @xmath58 as a function of @xmath46 , which means low degree nodes belong to interconnected communities .",
    "many real networks have been found  @xcite to be having such nontrivial decay .",
    "we find that in ani , @xmath58 shows a power - law decay with @xmath63 this points toward an inherent hierarchy in the architecture of ani .",
    "this is an interesting result as it has been found  @xcite that some other infrastructure networks ( internet at the router level and power grid network of western united states ) which are constrained by `` geographical organization '' do not show such hierarchy .",
    "this could be because , as opposed to the above - mentioned networks , where the cost of having a link grows in proportion to the distance between two nodes , the geographical constraint is not so strong in the case of airport networks .",
    "it is relatively easier to add an air connection to the existing network , than to add a data cable or an electrical cable for comparable geographical distances .",
    "average unweighted ( @xmath58 ) and weighted ( @xmath64 ) clustering coefficients of nodes with degree @xmath46 . ]    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] , after remaining almost constant for @xmath65 , @xmath58 falls rapidly thereafter .",
    "this indicates that large airports provide air connectivity to far - off airports , which themselves do not tend to be connected . in ani ,",
    "regional and national hubs provide air connectivity to airports in their domains , with the latter providing it to a much larger number , which reduces the @xmath58 of these hubs .",
    "we find that @xmath66 , which means that the traffic is accumulated on interconnected groups of nodes which form high traffic corridors , also known as _ trunk routes_. we find that @xmath62 is restricted in its range across @xmath46 and is consistently higher than the corresponding @xmath67 the higher the @xmath46 , more pronounced is the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that with increasing degree , airports have progressive tendency to form interconnected groups with high - traffic links .",
    "this _ rich - club phenomena _  @xcite , in which high degree nodes tend to form cliques with nodes with equal or higher degree , is also observed in wan  @xcite .",
    "another parameter which is used to investigate the networks architecture is the average degree of nearest neighbors , @xmath68 , for nodes of degree @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to calculate @xmath68 , which is related to the correlations between the degrees of connected vertices as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the conditional probability that a given vertex @xmath46 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath71 for a topology with no correlations among nodes connectivity , the conditional probability as well as @xmath68 are independent of @xmath72 on the contrary , explicit dependence on @xmath46 is a signature of non - trivial correlations among the nodes connectivity and the possible presence of a hierarchical structure in the network topology . in the presence of correlations ,",
    "a network can be classified as one having `` assortative mixing '' or `` disassortative mixing '' , based on whether @xmath68 is an increasing or decreasing function of @xmath46 , respectively . in the former class , high degree nodes",
    "have tendency to be connected to nodes with large degrees , whereas in the latter class high degree nodes have a majority of low degree nodes as their neighbors . for a weighted network the _ weighted average nearest neighbors degree _  @xcite could be defined as , @xmath73 which measures the effective _ affinity _ to connect with high- or low - degree neighbors according to the magnitude of the actual interactions .",
    "the trend of @xmath74 indicates the weighted assortative or disassortative nature of the network considering the strength of interactions among the nodes .",
    "average unweighted ( @xmath68 ) and weighted ( @xmath75 ) degree of nearest neighbors of nodes with degree @xmath46 . ]",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "[ fig : degree_corr ] ) that ani has uncorrelated structure for small degrees ( @xmath65 ) with no definite assortative or disassortative mixing . but for larger degrees ( @xmath76 ) ani shows a clear disassortative mixing .",
    "this property of ani is drastically different from that of wan which was found to be having assortative mixing for small degrees ( @xmath77 ) beyond which it approaches a constant value .",
    "the consistent disassortativity in ani for higher degrees could be attributed to the political compulsions on regional and national hubs to provide connectivity to a large number of low - degree destinations .",
    "a hub in wan is connected to many other hubs ( in other countries ) , thus compensating for the large number of connections with low - degree airports .",
    "since the number of hubs is limited in a national airport network , such as ani , it could lead to disassortative topology .",
    "this feature of ani is consistent with the nature of airport network of china  @xcite which is reported to be disassortative .",
    "this could well be a feature of national infrastructure networks which have similar geo - political compulsions .",
    "the normalized correlation function ( @xmath78 )  @xcite ( @xmath79 ) is another global quantitative measure of degree correlations in a network , which is zero for no correlations among nodes connectivity and positive or negative for assortative or disassortative mixing , respectively . for ani we find @xmath80 , indicating disassortative mixing which is consistent with the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : degree_corr ] .",
    "many technological networks and biological networks are found to be disassortative , while social networks are found to be assortative  @xcite .",
    "indian railway network  @xcite has also been found to be disassortative .",
    "we find that weighted degree correlation , @xmath75 , is restricted in its range across @xmath46 and is consistently higher than its unweighted counterpart , @xmath68 , indicating toward bias in the traffic in ani",
    ". the larger the degree of a node , the more pronounced is the difference .",
    "this implies that despite disassortative topology , the traffic is concentrated between high degree nodes .",
    "this is understandable as most airline service providers concentrate on certain profitable , so called , _ trunk routes _ , thereby creating high traffic corridors  @xcite .",
    "we find that ani , despite being small in size , has complex dynamics similar to those of bigger air transportation networks .",
    "it represents an evolving transport infrastructure of a developing nation .",
    "it presents a case of a national airport network which has a different mechanism of formation than the global network .",
    "ani , whose topology has a signature of hierarchy , has small - world network features and is characterized by a truncated scale - free degree distribution .",
    "analysis of weighted ani reveals clearer picture of the network dynamics . the traffic in ani",
    "is found to be accumulated on interconnected groups of airports .",
    "it has disassortative mixing in contrast to wan , with hubs having large number of low - degree neighbors .",
    "the topological disassortativity is offset by the traffic dynamics as the traffic is concentrated between high - degree nodes .",
    "ani is expected to grow at a rapid speed with addition of airports , several low - cost air services  @xcite , and importantly by increase in strength and complexity of interactions .",
    "it will be interesting to study the evolution of this air transportation network , as it offers an excellent example to understand and model the topology , traffic dynamics and geo - political constraints which shape a national infrastructure of economic importance .",
