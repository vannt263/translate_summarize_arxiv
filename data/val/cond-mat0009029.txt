    "the ising model is one of the most studied and basic models for phase transitions . in this article , the current status of experimental studies characterizing two classic models of second - order phase transitions in short - range interaction systems in the presence of quenched disorder ,",
    "the random - exchange ising model ( reim ) and the random - field ising model ( rfim ) , is presented .",
    "the discussion concentrates on experiments in dilute , insulating , anisotropic antiferromagnets , the systems that have yielded the best understood data for these two models .",
    "the reim is realized in zero magnetic field and the rfim with a field applied along the spin - ordering direction .",
    "the reim is rather well characterized experimentally , theoretically and through computer simulations .",
    "the @xmath0 rfim is fairly well characterized , although the scaling behavior of scattering near the destroyed phase transition is still being investigated .",
    "the understanding of the rfim for @xmath1 is not as complete , though significant progress has been made in the past few years , and it is this model that will be the main focus of this short review .",
    "the early history of the @xmath1 rfim was fraught with controversial interpretations of the data , a result of severe nonequilibrium effects .",
    "nevertheless , some experimental groups realized from the start that underlying the observed , complicated behavior is a new kind of phase transition .",
    "efforts to characterize the new critical behavior were thwarted by the severe nonequilibrium effects .",
    "these nonequilibrium effects have recently been overcome by going to sufficiently high magnetic concentration and a complete characterization of the universal @xmath1 rfim critical behavior is possible and underway . the most recent static critical behavior will be compared to results from computer simulations and theory .",
    "in addition to these low - field behaviors , much has been learned about the high - field limit of the rfim .",
    "an overview will be given of the phase diagram and the different behaviors observed .",
    "experiments have been performed on reim and rfim systems for more than two decades .",
    "since the experiments performed some time ago have been reviewed previously@xcite , they will be included here only as needed to give a perspective on the current physical understanding of the models . theory and simulation results",
    "will be included as needed for the interpretation of the experiments .",
    "another classic model of ordering in the presence of disorder , the spin glass , will be covered in another review@xcite in this ising colloquium and so will not be discussed here in detail , although some spin - glass - like behaviors do occur at low magnetic concentrations and at high magnetic fields .",

    "as the magnetic percolation threshold concentration , @xmath4 , is approached from above in zero field , the equilibrium phase transition is expected to approach zero temperature . for a particular magnetic structure ,",
    "@xmath4 depends on what interactions exist between the different neighboring spins .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 , @xmath6 provided only the dominant interaction between the body - center and corner spins is considered@xcite . except very close to @xmath4",
    ", the much smaller interactions can be ignored .",
    "close to @xmath4 , however , the smaller interactions may drastically affect the behavior and even prevent ordering above @xmath4 when they frustrate the dominate interaction . both the extremely slow dynamics near percolation@xcite and",
    "the sensitivity to tiny frustrating interactions@xcite can cause the system to exhibit spin - glass - like behavior .",
    "a good deal of effort has focused on the properties of the system @xmath5 for @xmath7 near @xmath4 .",
    "this system has a small frustrating interaction@xcite .",
    "the spin - glass - like properties were first elucidated in experiments by montenegro , et al.@xcite . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "there exists a boundary that resembles a de almeida - thouless boundary with curvature @xmath10 where @xmath11 , a typical spin - glass value .",
    "it was shown with neutron scattering@xcite that there is no antiferromagnetic long - range ordering below this boundary .",
    "much of the behavior is very reminiscent of a canonical spin glass .",
    "the detailed behavior of this sample has been studied experimentally@xcite and extensively modeled in local mean - field@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "scaling arguments for zeeman and domain wall energies by imry and ma@xcite as well as considerations by binder@xcite leave little doubt that the @xmath0 ising transition is destroyed by the introduction of arbitrarily small random fields .",
    "birefringence@xcite and neutron bragg scattering@xcite experiments bear this out ; no sharp phase transition is observed in equilibrium , though the rounded transition exhibits the expected scaling behavior .",
    "the equilibrium region is separated from a lower temperature region of strong hysteresis observed in the difference between data obtained upon heating after cooling in zero field to low temperatures and then applying the field ( zfc ) and upon simply cooling the sample in the field ( fc ) .",
    "the boundary separating these regions is time - scale dependent@xcite .",
    "the domain dynamics induced with the application of a magnetic field as well as those remaining after the field is removed at low temperatures have been studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "the behavior for concentrations between @xmath4 and the percolation threshold concentration for vacancies , @xmath13 , with a relatively small applied field occupied the bulk of early experimental efforts@xcite .",
    "much of the controversy over interpretations of experimental data involved this region of concentration and fields . as a result of the equivalence@xcite of the dilute anisotropic antiferromagnet in small fields and the random - field ferromagnet often studied theoretically",
    ", it was believed that concentrations near @xmath14 would yield strong random - field effects in reasonably small fields and would be the best realizations of the @xmath1 rfim for phase transition studies . at the time of the first experiments@xcite",
    ", it was generally believed , based on many theoretical arguments , that no phase transition would be observed .",
    "indeed , early neutron scattering fc experiments , by yoshizawa , et al.@xcite , seemed to bear this out .",
    "in particular , a resolution - limited gaussian bragg peak does not occur upon fc , although subsequent experiments@xcite show that the samples retain long - range order below the phase boundary if zfc .",
    "in contrast , the first @xmath15 studies@xcite yielded compelling evidence for a fundamentally new phase transition governing the behavior .",
    "the phase boundary @xmath16 behaves as predicted@xcite with @xmath17 for random - exchange to random - field crossover@xcite .    despite the sharp @xmath15 peak ,",
    "many have argued against it as evidence of the existence of a phase transition .",
    "the most recent of these is the `` trompe loeil transition '' phenomenological model@xcite . among the assumptions of this model",
    "are that the birefringence and @xmath15 experiments do not yield the same behavior , the uniform magnetization is reflected by the square of the staggered magnetization , and conventional scaling is inoperative .",
    "this phenomenological model was shown to be inconsistent@xcite when all available data are considered .",
    "in contrast , more proven and conventional techniques of analyzing the experimental data , as described in this review , have been very fruitful in providing consistent results in a meaningful scaling context .",
    "it is clear that the phase transition underlying the behavior is obscured by nonequilibrium behavior below the boundary , @xmath18 , lying just above the phase transition and scaling in the same manner , albeit with a slightly larger amplitude@xcite .",
    "the equilibrium behavior above @xmath18 can be used to extrapolate the scattering data to the obscured phase transition boundary . when done carefully , the boundary determined in this way",
    "coincides with that determined via @xmath15 experiments , which are much less sensitive to the non - equilibrium behavior that distorts the neutron scattering data . for a long time",
    ", the nonequilibrium experiments represented the best random - field results available .",
    "one of the particularly interesting predictions@xcite of the change in the critical behavior induced by the random fields is that the order parameter critical exponent @xmath19 should decrease from @xmath20 to a value near zero .",
    "this can only be measured below @xmath21 , i.e.  in the nonequilibrium region , so it was not clear what would be observed .",
    "experiments on thin films were made@xcite for @xmath22 , well below @xmath23 . not surprisingly , the results were peculiar . the curvature of the bragg intensity versus @xmath24 was such that it would require @xmath25 , which is hard to justify theoretically .",
    "magnetic x - ray scattering data showed similar behavior near surfaces in bulk samples , though they were interpreted under the `` trompe loeil '' phenomenology and the bragg scattering was not separated from the fluctuation scattering@xcite .",
    "for some years it appeared that the problems of metastability below @xmath18 could not be avoided , i.e.  that they were intrinsic to the random - field behavior as realized in dilute antiferromagnets .",
    "however , insight into the origins of the metastable domains finally led to experiments@xcite at high magnetic concentration as a way to avoid the nonequilibrium behavior , as discussed later .",
    "the metastable domains formed upon fc are themselves quite interesting and their dynamics were studied in some detail both experimentally@xcite and through simulations@xcite .",
    "the general phase diagram features , shown in fig .",
    "4 for the rfim at high fields were investigated in pioneering pulsed - field magnetization measurements@xcite in @xmath26 .",
    "low temperature single spin flips and the phase boundary are shown in fig .  5 and , interestingly , the behavior of the upper phase boundary appears to be different for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with the differentiation of the behaviors observed in neutron scattering experiments above and below @xmath29 .    in recent years , it has become clear that weak rfim ( small applied field ) and strong rfim regimes exist for @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath30 system exhibits@xcite typical low - field behavior for @xmath31  t , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 scaling as @xmath34 with @xmath35 . at larger fields ,",
    "however , the curvature for @xmath33 changes to @xmath36 , a value close to that observed in spin glasses . some of these features were suggested qualitatively@xcite . while the lower region has been shown to have antiferromagnetic long - range order upon zfc@xcite , no long - range antiferromagnetic order",
    "is observed at the higher fields below @xmath18 . instead , spin - glass - like behavior is observed .",
    "this is clearly the same type of behavior observed for all fields at the percolation threshold concentration@xcite .",
    "the same type of distinctive low and high field behaviors have been observed for @xmath7 as large as @xmath37 .",
    "the two regions are separated by an equilibrium boundary@xcite , as observed for @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "6 ) and @xmath37 , and it appears to decrease towards the @xmath39 boundary at finite temperature well below @xmath21 and approach the phase transition line at finite field , a point separating the sharp transition observed at low field and the more glassy transition at higher fields .",
    "this also is consistent@xcite with specific heat peaks that are very sharp at low fields and quite rounded at high fields@xcite .",
    "the distinction between high- and low - field behavior behavior is observed as well in ac susceptibility experiments . at low fields",
    ", there exists a single peak which seems to be associated with extremely slow dynamics , either from activated dynamics or at least power - law behavior with a very large dynamic exponent@xcite .",
    "there is little hysteresis between the zfc and fc procedures at low @xmath40 . at larger fields the peak splits in the zfc procedure only , with a sharp peak at slightly lower temperatures than the broader peak@xcite .",
    "this splitting appears to be associated with the upper region of the phase diagram corresponding to the spin - glass - like behavior@xcite .",
    "these effects have not been investigated for @xmath41 .",
    "the high field region for these concentrations is still an open area for research .",
    "it was , of course , realized very early that the metastable domain walls at low magnetic concentrations took advantage of vacancies .",
    "what was not fully appreciated was that the imry - ma domain wall energy argument@xcite is not applicable when domain walls can to a great extent pass through vacancies , avoiding the energy cost of breaking magnetic bonds . with sufficient vacancies , i.e.  for @xmath27",
    ", domain walls can take advantage of vacancies to such an extent that the domain wall energy can be insignificant .",
    "interestingly , every experiment that could have detected low temperature hysteresis , particularly neutron scattering and capacitance@xcite experiments , was done for @xmath42 , which is below @xmath43 .",
    "higher concentrations were avoided since the generated random fields are small , resulting in relatively very narrow asymptotic random - field critical regions around @xmath21 . nevertheless , concentrations well above @xmath29 are necessary to study the equilibrium critical behavior and require high magnetic fields and very fine temperature resolution .",
    "figure 2 shows the specific heat data for @xmath44 , measured with optical linear birefringence .",
    "the specific heat was also measured to demonstrate that , in agreement with theory@xcite and contrary to the so - called ` trompe loeil ' phenomenology@xcite , the data from the both techniques yield the same critical parameters .",
    "an important advantage of the birefringence technique is its relative insensitivity to the concentration gradients that tend to smear the transition@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the critical behavior appears to be very similar to that of lower concentrations where metastable domains dominate the scattering behavior .",
    "the specific heat was studied using monte carlo simulations@xcite based on the @xmath44 system and the results are shown in fig .",
    "although the simulations are not of sufficient resolution to extract the critical exponent , the similarities in the shapes of both the reim and rfim indicate the same qualitative change from the asymmetric cusp at @xmath39 to the nearly symmetric peaks at @xmath8 .",
    "this result , however , is not seen in all mc simulations@xcite .",
    "the neutron scattering experiments on @xmath44 show no hysteresis below the phase transition , in stark contrast with samples with @xmath27 . there is no evidence that domains form upon zfc or fc in this concentration range and the line shapes are independent of the thermal cycling procedure , implying equilibrium conditions .",
    "neutron scattering experiments on this sample were difficult to analyze since the rfim line shape is not known from theory . in general , two different scaling functions are involved with the form @xmath45 with two independent sets of critical behavior exponents .",
    "however , simulations@xcite and high temperature series expansions@xcite strongly suggest a simpler scenario .",
    "the predictions are that the exponents are simply related , @xmath46 being twice @xmath47 , and the new scaling function @xmath48 is , to a good approximation , the square of @xmath49 .    not only were the universal rfim critical parameters obtained in this experimental study , but the scaling analysis yielded the spin - spin correlation scaling function @xmath49 .",
    "this scaling function is compared to several other known spin - spin correlation scaling functions in fig .  1 .",
    "note that the @xmath1 rfim one seems the furthest away from the mf lorentzian of all the examples for @xmath50 , whereas for @xmath50 the pure @xmath0 case is further than the @xmath1 rfim , though both are very far from mf behavior .",
    "the critical parameters for the rfim with @xmath28 are shown in table 4 .",
    "certainly more effort is needed to complete the experimental entries and to find reconciliation between the simulation and experimental results .",
    "note that some sets of exponents from the simulations violate@xcite the rushbrooke scaling relation in eq .",
    "the regions of low temperature nonequilibrium behavior and equilibrium behavior have been shown to be separated at relatively small @xmath40 by a nearly vertical sharp boundary at @xmath51 in @xmath5 using monte carlo studies@xcite .",
    "figure 7 shows simulations on lattices of size @xmath52 with @xmath53 modeled closely after @xmath5 .",
    "hysteresis is observed upon fc and zfc for @xmath27 but not above .",
    "the hysteresis for @xmath27 increases for larger lattices or slower thermal cycling , showing that it is not simply an artifact of the simulations not being run long enough .",
    "the concentration dividing equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior is very close to or equal to the vacancy percolation threshold concentration @xmath54 .",
    "apparently , the percolation vacancy structure facilitates the formation of domain walls .    to further investigate this boundary ,",
    "recent experiments have been done@xcite on a sample with @xmath55 , just above @xmath29 .",
    "no evidence of domains has been observed for small @xmath40 .",
    "since earlier experiments@xcite for @xmath56 in @xmath5 gave clear evidence for domain formation , including a reversal of the bragg intensity curvature just below @xmath21 upon zfc , the boundary must be @xmath57 , in agreement with the mc simulations .",
    "there have been no theoretical studies reported explaining the existence or nature of this boundary .",
    "the recent measurement of the equilibrium critical behavior in the random - field ising model has side - stepped the great difficulties encountered in the interpretation of data below the transition that are obfuscated by nonequilibrium phenomena in many studies at lower concentrations .",
    "certainly , there is wide agreement that a phase transition exists .",
    "although experiments for @xmath28 are much more difficult since the random - field region is very narrow , they are being done .",
    "interestingly , the experimental results are not in agreement with much of the theory and simulation results , unlike the reim and pure ising model . a reliable characterization of some aspects of the @xmath1 rfim universality class behavior remains to be completed .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath5 has proven to be quite rich in detail .",
    "an important area of the phase diagram for which a good understanding is being developed is the large random field limit for @xmath12 . with the the progress being made along these two lines of inquiry , a rather complete experimental characterization of the rfim in dilute antiferromagnets seems near at hand .",
