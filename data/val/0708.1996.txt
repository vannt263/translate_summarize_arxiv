    "the interest in anchoring phenomena and phenomena in confined nematic liquid crystals has largely been driven by their potential use in liquid crystal display devices .",
    "the twisted nematic liquid crystal cell serves as an example .",
    "it consists of a nematic liquid crystal confined between two parallel walls , both providing homogeneous planar anchoring but with mutually perpendicular easy directions . in this case",
    "the orientation of the nematic director is tuned by the application of an external electric or magnetic field .",
    "a precise control of the surface alignment extending over large areas is decisive for the functioning of such devices .",
    "most studies have focused on nematic liquid crystals in contact with laterally uniform substrates . on the other hand substrate inhomogeneities",
    "arise rather naturally as a result of surface treatments such as rubbing .",
    "thus the nematic texture near the surface is in fact non - uniform .",
    "this non - uniformity , however , is smeared out beyond a decay length proportional to the periodicity of the surface pattern .",
    "very often the thickness of the non - uniform surface layer is considerably smaller than both the wavelength of visible light and the thickness of the nematic cell , i.e. , the distance between the two confining parallel walls",
    ". hence optical properties of the nematic liquid crystal confined between such substrates correspond to those resulting from effective , uniform substrates .",
    "more recent developments have demonstrated that surfaces patterned with a large periodicity of some micrometers are of considerable interest from a technological point of view ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a new generation of electro - optical devices relies on nematic liquid crystals with patterned orientation of the nematic director over small areas which can be achieved by chemically patterning the confining surfaces .",
    "for example , to produce flat - panel displays with wide viewing angles one can use pixels that are divided into sub - pixels , where each sub - pixel is defined by a different orientation of the nematic director , which is induced by the surface structure and subsequently tuned by the electric field .",
    "in addition to the technological relevance , nematic liquid crystals in contact with non - uniform substrates provide the opportunity to study basic phenomena such as effective elastic forces between the substrates and phase transitions between various competing nematic textures ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    whereas the influence of homogeneous confining substrates on nematic liquid crystals is now well understood ,",
    "the phase behavior of nematic liquid crystals in contact with chemically or geometrically patterned substrates is still debated .",
    "one might suppose that theoretical calculations based on continuum theories should resolve the properties of nematic liquid crystals in contact with patterned substrates @xcite .",
    "however , such calculations are numerically demanding because two- or three - dimensional grids have to be used because of the broken symmetry due to the surface pattern .",
    "moreover , it is very challenging to determine metastable states and energy barriers between them which are important for the understanding of bistable nematic devices @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we adopt a different strategy which takes the advantage of the finite decay length characterizing the influence of the surface pattern on the nematic liquid crystal in the direction perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "we determine first an anchoring energy function and an average surface director orientation of the patterned substrate and obtain an effective free energy for the nematic liquid crystal cell under consideration .",
    "we find remarkably good agreement between the phase diagrams of various systems calculated using this effective free energy function on the one hand and the original free energy functional on the other hand .",
    "the continuum theory for liquid crystals has its origin dating back to at least the work of oseen @xcite and zocher @xcite .",
    "this early version of the continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals played an important role for the further development of the static theory and its more direct formulation by frank @xcite .",
    "the frank theory is formulated in terms of the so - called nematic director @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and its possible spatial distortions .",
    "the nematic director describes the direction of the locally averaged molecular alignment in liquid crystals . in a nematic liquid crystal",
    "the centers of mass of the liquid crystal molecules do not exhibit long - ranged order .",
    "the molecules can translate freely while being aligned , on average , parallel to one another and to the nematic director .",
    "it is known that if an initially uniform nematic liquid crystal is distorted by external forces , it relaxes back to the uniform state after the disturbing influence is switched off , signaling that the uniform configuration represents a thermodynamically stable state .",
    "therefore it is assumed that there is a cost in free energy associated with elastic distortions of the nematic director of the form @xmath2&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\int_v",

    "the description of the nematic director alignment at the surfaces forming the boundaries is called anchoring .",
    "in addition to the so - called free boundary condition where there is no anchoring , one considers weak and strong anchoring . if there are no anchoring conditions imposed on @xmath14 at the boundary , the bulk free energy @xmath15 is minimized using standard techniques of the calculus of variations . in the case of strong anchoring it",
    "is also sufficient to minimize the bulk free energy but subject to @xmath14 taking prescribed fixed values at the boundary . in the case of weak",
    "anchoring the total free energy @xmath16 , which includes the surface free energy @xmath11 , has to be minimized .",
    "the most commonly used expression for the surface free energy is of the form proposed by rapini and papoular by @xcite : @xmath17=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{s } d^2 r\\,w({\\bf r } ) ( \\hat{{\\bf n}}\\cdot{\\nu})^2.\\ ] ] the integral runs over the boundary and @xmath18 is the corresponding anchoring strength that characterizes the surface .",

    "@xmath140 the transition line ends at a critical point ( not shown in the figure ) , while it diverges as @xmath145 .",

    "the effective free energy method allows one to calculate an energy barrier @xmath147 between the two bistable states , which is _ not _",

    "[ fig4 ]  ( b ) ) one can estimate the energy barrier in a real nematic liquid crystal cell .",
    "for instance , for a cell of area @xmath149 and of width @xmath150 , and taking the typical values @xmath151 and @xmath152 , one obtains @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which seems to be an acceptable value .",
    "another important quantity in zenithally bistable nematic devices is the average director orientation at the grating surface in the two degenerate states .",

    "hence the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the groove depth at which the bistability is observed , which improves optical properties @xcite , and to a decrease of the energy barrier , which lowers the power consumption of a zenithally bistable nematic device . on the other hand ,",
    "also the difference between the two bistable states decreases which impairs optical properties of such a device .",
    "in section [ iiia ] we have discussed phase diagrams in the @xmath159 plane which can be described in terms of the surface free energy given by eq .  .",

    "this conclusion applies also to the function @xmath173 , thus , there can be either one or two critical points in the phase diagram ( see eqs . and ) . in the limit of large @xmath35",

    "this is because @xmath174 is not a periodic function of @xmath175 at fixed @xmath40 . to find @xmath40 at the transition we expand @xmath11 around its deepest minimum ( denoted @xmath176 ) , which leads to the approximate free energy : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the extrapolation length .",
    "since @xmath176 and @xmath179 are equivalent minima of @xmath11 , and both @xmath176 and @xmath40 are allowed to vary in the interval @xmath180 $ ] , the transition occurs at @xmath181 if @xmath182 or at @xmath183 if @xmath184 . with the above information we can now draw schematically the phase diagram ( see fig .

    "since the vertical lines at @xmath171 are to be identified with each other the phase diagram can be considered on a cylindrical surface .",
    "away from the transition lines there is a smooth evolution from one texture to another .",
