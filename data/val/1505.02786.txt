    "the cyg x-1 spectra of each scw were extracted with 67 spectral channels .",

    "the compton photons were accumulated in 6 angular bins , each with a width of @xmath37 in azimuthal scattering angle . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in each bin , we took advantage of the @xmath38-symmetry of the differential cross section ( eq .  [ eq : azimuth ] ) ,",
    "i.e. , the first bin contains the photons with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , etc .",
    "chance coincidences , i.e. , photons interacting in both detectors , but not related to a compton event , were subtracted from each detector image following the procedure described by @xcite .",

    "for the remaining pointings where no such asm measurements exist , we used the same approach , first based on maxi and then , if necessary , based on bat .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the probability that a state is wrongly assigned using this method is 5% within 6h of an asm pointing for both the lhs and hss , and @xmath1725% for the is .    out of the 3302 ibis scws , 1739 ( @xmath1752.7% )",

    "* ) , we estimate that the polarization fraction is @xmath161 at the 95% level , and greater than a few % at the 99.7% level . in other words",
    "we obtain a significance higher than @xmath54 for a polarized 4002000kev lhs emission .",
    "we determine a polarization fraction and a credibility interval of @xmath162 at position angle @xmath163 .",
    "the values of the polarization fraction and angle are consistent with those found by jrc12 .",
    "we note that an error of 180@xmath164 in the angle convention in lrw11 led to @xmath165 , which after correction becomes @xmath166 , in agreement with our state resolved result ( see also jrc12 ) .",
    "note that the good agreement of our results with those obtained with spi in the case of cyg x-1 , but also the fact that ibis also detected polarization in the high energy emission of the crab nebula and pulsar @xcite at values compatible with those obtained with spi @xcite , increase the confidence in the reality and validity of our results .",
    "our analysis shows that the @xmath3kev spectral properties of cyg x-1 depend on the spectral state , as already suggested previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we detect a strong hard tail in the lhs , but obtain only upper limits in the is and hss . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comptel ] ( left ) , we show a comparison of our lhs 0.751mev spectrum with those obtained with _",
    "cgro_/comptel during the june 1996 hss and during an extended lhs observed with this instrument @xcite .",
    "the ibis hard tail is compatible in terms of fluxes to within @xmath167 to those seen with comptel and also with the /spi hard tail reported in jrc12 ( see their fig .  5 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that cyg x-1 is a notoriously highly variable source and flux evolution between different epochs is expected . to illustrate this behavior , we study data taken during two main periods , the covering march 2003 to december 2007 ( mjd 5272254460 ) and march 2008 to december 2009 ( mjd 5453055196 ) , respectively .",
    "these intervals correspond to the analysis of lrw11 .",
    "the two compton spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comptel ] ( right ) .",
    "it is obvious that the flux of the hard tail varied between the two epochs and an evolution of the slope may also be visible .",
    "we note that these data are not separated by states , but as they cover the period before december 2009 , they are dominated by the lhs ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : ryle ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that , even in the same state , the hard tail shows luminosity variations .",
    "a major difference to @xcite is the non - detection of a hard tail in the hss .",
    "@xcite remark that between two epochs of hss the hard tail either has a higher flux than in their averaged lhs or is not detected .",
    "@xcite also note that the 1996 hss hard tail comes from a single occurrence of this state and may not reflect a typical behavior .",
    "while detection of a hard tail during the lhs , even if it shows variations , indicates an underlying process that is rather stable over long period of times , the apparent transience of the hss hard tail may indicate a different origin for this feature .",
    "for example , in cyg  x-3 the very high energy ( fermi ) flares are associated with transitions to the ultra soft state @xcite . while this is similar to what is seen in cyg  x-1 , all fermi @xmath168-ray flares of cyg x-1",
    "were reported during lhs @xcite .",
    "while the lack of simultaneous very high energy gev - tev data , and/or polarimetric studies of the comptel hss hard tail prevent any further conclusion on the origin of this component , we conclude that the hss hard tail and the lhs hard tail could be of different origin .",
    "a clear polarized signal is detected from cyg  x-1 with both ibis and spi while accumulating all data regardless of the spectral state of the source ( lrw11 , jrc12 ) .",
    "here we separated the data into different spectral states and studied the state dependent high energy polarization properties .",
    "the hss and 300400kev polarigram can be described by a constant , indicating no or very little levels of polarization .",
    "the 4002000kev lhs polarigram shows a large deviation from a constant , which indicates that the compton scattering from isgri is not an evenly circular distribution on picsit .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for the presence of polarization in this energy range , even if the polarigram shows some deviations from the theoretically expected curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pola ] ) . in the 300400kev range ,",
    "no evidence for polarization is found .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained with spi ( jrc12 ) and shows that the polarization fraction is strongly energy dependent .",
    "assuming a non - null level of polarization , a reasonable assumption given the above arguments , we estimate that the detection of polarized emission is significant at higher than @xmath54 .",
    "given the larger amount of data and the separation into different spectral states , one could have expected to obtain more robust results , and more constrained polarization parameters compared to lrw11 and jcr12 , while the uncertainties we obtained are , at best , of the same order .",
    "the reason for this lies in the behavior of cyg  x-1 .",
    "while the earlier studies did not perform a state dependent analysis , our state classification reveals that both studies were dominated by data taken during the lhs and the is ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : ryle ] ) .",
    "in fact , compared to lrw11 the number of scws measured during the lhs increased only by 13% , and 75% of the is data comes from the period considered in these earlier studies , i.e. , before @xmath17mjd  55200 .",
    "on the other hand , about 94% of the hss data are new .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that our hard state result is consistent with the earlier results , as these were fully dominated by the ( polarized ) hard state data .",
    "the exposure of the less polarized is data was not large enough to significantly `` dilute '' the polarization .",
    "our result clearly shows that larger amounts of data in each of the states are needed to refine the constrain on the polarization properties and their relation to the spectral states .",
    "our lhs spectral analysis shows that the 101000kev spectrum can be decomposed into several spectral components .",
    "a ( reflected ) thermal comptonization component in the range @xmath169400kev , and a power - law tail dominating above @xmath17400kev (  [ sec : hardstate ] ) .",
    "the origin of the seed photons for the compton component may either be an accretion disk or synchrotron photons from a compact jet undergoing synchrotron self - comptonization ( ssc ) . as discussed elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to the large number of scatterings the comptonization spectrum from a medium with an optical depth @xmath170 is not expected to show intrinsic polarization , especially with such a high fraction as the one we detect here .",
    "multiple compton scattering , as expected in such a medium , will `` wash out '' the polarization of the incident photons even if the seed photons are polarized ( e.g. , jet photons ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the lhs @xmath171400kev component has a very low ( or zero ) polarization fraction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the hard - mev tail is much less clear and is highly model - dependent .",
    "two main families of models can explain the ( co-)existence of cut - off power - law and/or pure power - law like emissions in the energy spectra of bhbs . the first is based on the presence of an hybrid thermal - non thermal population of electron in a `` corona '' , and hybrid comptonization have been successfully applied to the spectra of , e.g. , gro j1655@xmath17240 or gx 339@xmath1724 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even to @xmath410000  kev spectra of cyg x-1 , in both the hss and lhs @xcite .",
    "a double thermal component has been used to represent the 201000kev spi data of 1e 1740@xmath1722947 well @xcite .",
    "the second family of models essentially contains the same radiation processes but is based on the presence of a jet emitting through direct synchrotron emission , thermal comptonization of the soft disk photons on the base of the jet , and/or ssc of the synchrotron photons by the jet s electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such models have been used with success to fit the data of some bh , and particularly gx 339@xmath1724 and xte j1118 + 480 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that they obviously rely on the presence of a compact jet and therefore can only be valid when / if a compact jet is present .",
    "the capacities of the current high energy missions , albeit excellent , do not permit today an easy discrimination between the different families of models .",
    "this has nicely been illustrated in the specific case of cyg x-1 through the 0.8300kev spectral analysis of the suzaku / rxte observations @xcite .",
    "different and complementary approaches and arguments can , however , be used to try and identify the most likely origin for the hard power - law tail .",
    "the fundamental plane between radio luminosity and x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has originally been used as an argument for a ( small ) contribution of the jet to the x - ray domain .",
    "our approach here was to first separate the radio data sets into different spectral states , based on a model - independent classification .",
    "it was only because of this separation that could we show that a hard polarized tail is present in the lhs , with a high polarization fraction , together with a radio jet .",
    "the very high level of polarization can only originate from optically thin synchrotron emission ( see below ) , and implies a highly ordered magnetic field similar to that expected in jets .",
    "the synchrotron tail coincides with thermal comptonization at lower energies and with a radio jet .",
    "the presence of all these features is qualitatively compatible with the multi - component emission processes predicted by compact jet models such as those of @xcite . while polarization of the ( compact ) jet emission has already been widely reported in the radio domain ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , a thorough study of the multi - wavelength polarization properties of cyg x-1 has only recently been undertaken by @xcite .",
    "these authors , in particular , showed that the multi - wavelength spectrum and polarization properties of cyg x-1 are quantitatively compatible with the presence of a compact jet that dominates the radio to ir domain and is also responsible for the mev tail .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by @xcite under the assumption that `` the polarization measurements were robust '' and that therefore the mev tail could only originate from synchrotron emission .",
    "this pre - requisite is reinforced by our refined and spectral - state dependent study of the polarized properties of cyg x-1 at 0.31mev .",
    "a polarized signal is indeed suggested by the 4002000kev lhs data and the large degree of polarization measured in  [ sec : res - polar ] implies a very ordered magnetic field . assuming the magnetic field lines are anchored in the disk",
    "implies that the @xmath168-ray polarized emission comes from close to the inner ridge of the disk where the magnetic energy density is highest .",
    "this constraint is difficult to reconcile with a spherically shaped corona medium , where the magnetic field lines are more likely to be tangled and where the polarized component necessarily comes from the outer shells of the corona where the optical depth is the lowest .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that * in the lhs * the 0.42 mev tail detected with /ibis is very likely due to optically thin synchrotron emission , and that this emission comes from the detected compact jet .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of a population of electrons following a power - law distribution , @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the particle distribution index , can be approximated by a power - law function over a limited range of energy , i.e. , @xmath175 over @xmath176 $ ] @xcite . in the case of compact jets ,",
    "two main domains are usually considered : the optically thick regime with @xmath177 and the optically thin regime with @xmath178 .",
    "the break between the two regimes is typically in the infrared band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the jet synchrotron spectrum is optically thin towards higher energies , and here @xmath179 .",
    "the jet emission becomes negligible in the range from the optical to hard x - rays when compared to the contribution from other components such as the companion star , the accretion disk , or the corona .",
    "our results indicate that it again dominates above a few hundredkev ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a multi - components modeling of the multi - wavelength cyg x-1 spectrum ) .",
    "the degree of polarized emission expected in the optically thin regime is @xmath180 @xcite . since the flux spectral index @xmath181 , where @xmath65 is the photon spectral index , it is possible to deduce @xmath174 from the measured spectral shape . with @xmath122 (  [ sec : hardstate ] ) we obtain @xmath182 and thus expect @xmath183",
    "this value is consistent with the value measured in the lhs ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "we determine a polarization angle of @xmath17@xmath185 compatible with the spi results ( jrc12 ) .",
    "this angle , however , differs by about @xmath186 from the polarization angles measured in the radio and optical ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "assuming that the @xmath168-ray polarized component comes from the region of the jet that is closest to the launch site ( i.e. , the inner ridge of the disk and/or the bh ) , the change in polarization angle implies that the field lines in the @xmath168-ray emitting region have a different orientation than further out in the jet .",
    "this could be indicative of a relatively large opening angle at the basis of the jet ( as sketched in fig .",
    "3 of * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively the large offset could simply be due to strongly twisted magnetic field lines close to the accretion disk .",
    "we have presented a broad band 10kev2mev spectral analysis of the microquasar cyg x-1 based on about 10 years of data collected with the jem - x and ibis telescopes onboard the  observatory .",
    "we have used the classification criteria of @xcite to separate the data into hard ( lhs ) , intermediate ( is ) , and soft ( hss ) states .",
    "we have studied the radio behavior of the source associated with these states as observed with the ryle / ami radio telescope at 15  ghz .    *",
    "the @xmath187400kev emission is well represented by comptonization spectra with further reflection off the accretion disk . in the lhs and is , the comptonization process is thermal and optically thick , i.e. , the corona has an optical depth @xmath188 and the electrons have a maxwellian distribution . as a result",
    ", a clear high - energy cut - off is seen in the spectra . in the hss",
    "the situation is not that clear , although a cut - off is also necessary to give a good representation of the broad band spectrum .",
    "* a clear hard tail is detected in the lhs when also considering the 0.42mev data .",
    "this high energy component is well represented by a hard power - law with no obvious cut - off .",
    "the detection of the hard tail is compatible with earlier claims of the presence of such a component in spectra of cyg x-1 .",
    "we show that this component is variable within same state , as is seen when considering  observations from two arbitrary epochs but the same state . * in the radio domain , the 15ghz data show a definite detection with averaged flux densities of respectively @xmath1713 and @xmath1715mjy in the lhs and is , compatible with the presence of a compact jet in those states .",
    "no persistent radio emission is detected in the hss , implying the absence of a compact radio core .",
    "* in the lhs , we measure a polarized signal above 400kev with a large polarization fraction ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "this high degree of polarization and the polarization angle ( @xmath2 ) are both compatible with previous studies by us and others .",
    "we obtain non - constraining upper limits on the polarization fraction in the is and hss , which have significantly lower exposure . * the high degree of polarization of the hard tail can only originate from synchrotron emission in an highly ordered magnetic field .",
    "the demonstrated presence of radio emission in the lhs points towards the compact jet as the origin for the 0.42mev emission , corroborating earlier theoretical and multi - wavelengths studies @xcite .",
