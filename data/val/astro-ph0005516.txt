    "in a hot accretion flow around a supermassive black hole , the majority of the observable emission arises in the radio and x  ray bands . in the radio band the emission results from synchrotron radiation due to the thermal relativistic electrons moving in the near equipartition magnetic field in the inner parts of the accretion flow .",

    "we take @xmath50 yr@xmath51 , i.e. , with a canonical 10% efficiency .",
    "we model the different density profiles ( flatter than in the pure bondi inflow with @xmath52 ) by adopting a mass inflow rate which satisfies : @xmath53 .",
    "this relation is supported by recent numerical and analytical work ( stone et al .",
    "1999 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "1999 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) which has shown that mass loss via winds in hot accretion flows may be both dynamically crucial and quite substantial .",

    "compact radio cores or scaled down radio jets are also synchrotron emitters .",
    "the spectra of compact radio cores are generally flatter than those of extended sources and are often modeled by non - thermal synchrotron radiation from power law distributions of particles . because of the relative compactness of these sources , synchrotron self - absorption is also often important in this regime . at frequencies low enough for the source to be optically thick ,",

    "for compact sources the observed brightness temperature at @xmath67 can be derived by assuming that the surface brightness is equal to the source function e.g. @xmath68 where @xmath64 generally @xmath69 is also given by blumenthal and gould ( 1970 ) .",
    "the brightness temperature gives the energy and hence a typical @xmath61 for the electrons radiating at a frequency @xmath70 ; e.g. @xmath71 .",
    "spectra of radio cores do not usually rise as sharply as @xmath72 but their flatter spectral shape can be easily attributed to inhomogeneity .",
    "we model the radio spectrum with regions of different optical depth and magnetic field strengths and combine them to reproduce a spectrum that matches the one observed for the different objects over the observed frequencies .",
    "a jet provides an extremely natural context for inhomogeneous models . in a jet , because density and magnetic field strength plausibly decline outwards , a number of localized optically thick regions are likely to give rise to the observed emission . from the flux at a frequency @xmath70 , as given by our vla observations and using eq .",
    "( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) , we construct simple models for the spectra and deduce approximate optical depths and magnetic field strengths for the given sources .",
    "figure 2 shows our vla data points and the predicted adaf self - absorbed synchrotron emission .",
    "we note that , as discussed  2.1 and shown in figure 1 , all of the contribution from the weak jets in these systems can not be ignored and the measured radio fluxes should only be considered as upper limits to the emission from a hot accretion flow in their cores .",
    "regardless of that and in agreement with our previous results ( dm99 ) we find that in all cases the canonical adaf model ( solid lines in fig .",
    "2 ) greatly overestimates the total flux contribution at most frequencies . in addition , although the pure inflow models require the synchrotron emission to peak at @xmath73 hz , all the objects observed here and in dm99 have spectral energy distributions peaked at @xmath74 ghz , i.e. at energies much lower than predicted by adaf models .",
    "the emission at the self - absorbed synchrotron peak arises from the inner regions of an adaf and scales ( in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the accretion rate in the innermost regions of the flow . as discussed in dm99 thermal synchrotron emission",
    "can not be suppressed significantly by decreasing the magnetic field strength , b. a decrease in b leads to an increase in the flow temperature and hence an increase in synchrotron cooling itself ( unless @xmath77 is reduced to values below 0.1% equipartion ; see eq .  3 and dm99 ) .",
    "in addition , the lack of any significant variability of the high frequency emission from the most point - like source in our sample , ngc 4649 ( table 1 ) , and the faint high frequency radio fluxes systematically observed in all seven sources , excludes the possibility that significant variability may be the cause of the lack of the high energy radio flux .",
    "however , if the accretion rates in the inner regions of an adaf ( where all of the high energy emission is produced ; see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) are decreased with respect to the bondi values discussed in  3.1 , the adaf models can be brought to agreement with the data .",
    "there are two ways this can be achieved ( see also dm99 ) .",
    "the presence of mass loss implies @xmath78 which can lead to significant suppression of the central densities and accommodate the observed lack of a high energy synchrotron component ( in particular because the electron temperature @xmath79 also decreases as @xmath80 increases giving rise to a steep decrease in the synchrotron component ; eq .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the gas is not fed to flows at the expected bondi rates ( see  5.1 and di matteo & fabian 2000 ) and @xmath76 is much smaller than estimated in  3.1 or in previous work ( but possibly consistent with values deduced directly from the lower frequencies radio flux ; e.g.  wrobel & herrnstein 2000 ) .",
    "spectral models which include strong mass loss are shown by the long dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 . for these models",
    "we adopt an accretion rate which satisfies @xmath81 .",
    "for ngc 2300 the dashed line is for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for ngc 1399",
    "we used @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for ngc 4594 @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we use @xmath91 to fit the low frequency radio data .",
    "finally for ngc 4278 @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we note that similar fits ( but with slightly steeper rising spectra ) are obtained with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , corresponding to the full extent of the flow .    in all of the above cases , the values of @xmath80 and @xmath97",
    "imply that only a few percent of the bondi mass accretion rates are actually accreted onto the black holes and that most of the mass is lost in the outflows    in figure  2 we also show models for which @xmath76 is again constant but @xmath98 ( short dashed lines ) so as to agree the radio limits .",
    "we find that values of @xmath99 a few @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) are consistent with the radio measurements .",
    "we note that for these low accretion rates the temperature profiles steepen causing the slope of the synchrotron component also to steepen . as a result ,",
    "the radio fluxes are fitted less well by these models and definitely require an additional more extended component ( most likely the jets ) to account for a significant fraction of the observed fluxes .    in figure  3 we also model the radio spectra of the four galaxies by non - thermal synchrotron emission from compact jet - like regions as described in  3.2 . in the adaf models",
    ", we have assumed that there is no contribution to the observed emission from either the outflows ( which are considered non - radiative ) or from compact regions in the scaled - down radio jets also present in these sources .",
    "here we test whether non - thermal synchrotron models can also explain the radio spectral energy distributions and/or whether the physical parameters they require may favor the hot - accretion flow interpretation .",
    "figure 3 shows that if the accretion rates in an adaf are indeed stifled , either in the inner regions or throughout the hot flow such as is implied by our findings above ( or if indeed these systems are accreting via standard thin disks at even lower accretion rates ) , the radio data can be easily explained by standard non - thermal models for compact radio sources .",
    "if we adopt the hypothesis of inhomogeneity (  3.2 ) , the observed spectral breaks in the different sources and the general spectral shapes can be modeled simply by the emission from different compact regions emitting self - absorbed non - thermal synchrotron emission . in order to reproduce the steep fall off above @xmath102 ghz for most objects or indeed the typically steep , non - thermal spectrum of ngc 4278 we take @xmath103 . to infer rough values of optical depths and magnetic field strengths in the different regions we designate the frequencies @xmath67 and use the brightness temperatures and ( upper limits for ) the sizes implied by our vla measurements at the appropriate frequencies .",
    "we then use equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and the models shown in figure 3 and infer @xmath104 g and @xmath105 , which are typical values for core dominated , synchrotron self - absorbed sources .",
    "we note that the models in figure 3 are not unique ( different particle distributions and different regions can be used ) but they provide fairly solid estimates for the ranges of parameters that characterize the sources , and imply that the electrons we see directly have @xmath106 a few 100 .",
    "similar models have been constructed to model the radio spectral energy distribution of sgr a@xmath107 and other galactic radio cores ( e.g.  falcke & biermann 1999 ; beckert & duschl 1997 ) .",
    "we have found that all of the seven galactic radio cores observed here and in dm99 show severe discrepancies with the adaf model predictions .",
    "independent of its actual origin , the observed radio flux is always much less than that expected from pure inflow adafs accreting close to their bondi accretion rates . even in those objects where a spectral turnover is observed , as expected from thermal synchrotron emission from these hot accretion flows , it is usually at frequencies @xmath108 ghz , much lower than those predicted from adaf models .",
    "we have examined the constraints imposed on adaf models by the high - frequency radio observations .",
    "we have shown that , if indeed these supermassive black holes accrete via hot accretion flows , the suppression of the synchrotron component ( in agreement with the radio observations ) , implies that the accretion rates onto the central black holes ought to be greatly reduced with respect to the bondi rates estimated from the temperature and density of the hot ism .",
    "one way we can accommodate the lower accretion rates is by including strong mass loss / winds in the hot accretion flows .",
    "this is equivalent to adopting density profiles in the flows which are flatter than those for a pure inflow adaf ; with @xmath109 ( see  4 and fig.2 ) .",
    "the presence of outflows ( as proposed by blandford & begelman 1999 ) is strongly supported by numerical simulations ( stone et al .",
    "1999 ; igumenschev et al .",
    "1999 ; 2000 ) showing that mass loss can be a dynamical consequence of accretion occurring in these regimes .",
    "recent work also emphasizes that convection ( when @xmath110 ) may also lead to significantly suppressed densities in the inner regions of hot flows ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) with almost no accretion onto the black holes and @xmath111 .",
    "in addition to the above explanations , which are based on the possible consequences of the internal dynamics of a hot / quasi - spherical accretion flow , there may also be processes that simply change the physical conditions in the ism in regions close to the accretion radii of the systems such that small amounts of material are fed to the flows (  5.1 ) .",
    "any such process would need to reduce @xmath76 by a factor @xmath112 with respect to the estimated bondi rate ( section 4 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "we have also shown that given the observed low radio flux densities ( and given the resolution of the vla ) even the high - frequency radio emission from these nuclei can be easily reproduced by standard models of self - absorbed non - thermal synchrotron emission from the small scale radio jets observed in these systems ( fig .",
    "this implies that the derived @xmath76 ( and/or @xmath80 values in the case of winds ) can only provide upper limits to the possible contribution from hot accretion flows and that the relevant accretion rates could feasibly be lower .",
    "the radio emission could be produced in localized regions in the outflows / jets where the radiative efficiencies are much higher .",
    "if @xmath76 is small enough , a hot accretion flow may not even be required and accretion could for example occur via a standard accretion disk with high radiative efficiency with extremely low accretion rates ( to satisfy @xmath113 )    it is important to note that the standard adaf model is also inconsistent with the recent detection of linear polarization ( aitken et al .",
    "2000 ) at 1 mm in sgr a@xmath114 . a standard adaf model is unpolarized at these frequencies .",
    "in accordance with the constraints we have obtained here for the elliptical galaxy cores , in sgr a@xmath114 the accretion rate has to be much lower then that expected from bondi estimates ( agol 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "we suggest that outflows may stifle accretion by reducing @xmath29 .",
    "the small scales radio jets , present in all of these systems ( which may or may not be dynamically coupled to a hot accretion flow ) , are likely to transfer momentum and energy to the ambient gas . because the sizes of the radio jets are similar to those inferred for the accretion radii of these systems , ( see  3 ; for the black hole masses of @xmath115 ) the radio jets may heat the ism gas in that region .",
    "if gas outside and around the accretion radius , @xmath116 , is heated , the accretion radius decreases ( potentially up to a point where the accretion radius may not even exist ) leading to a decrease in the accretion rate ( or luminosity ) , where @xmath117 , for a given external pressure ( see di matteo & fabian 2000 for details ) .",
    "given that small scale radio jets are observed in basically all early type galaxy cores , we may expect the accretion rates to be reduced in most cases .",
    "the heating of the ism by jets / outflows may lead to similar effects as those due to conduction ( gruzinov 1999 ) , possibly induced by the presence of high magnetic fields which build up in the central regions of the hot , cooling ism .",
    "we note that if the accretion rate is indeed regulated by jet activity we should expect these sources to undergo cycles of activity .",
    "as the jets heat up the ism we expect the the accretion rates to decrease , but such a decrease will most likely lead to a decline of the jet activity itself . as the heating of the ism is then suppressed one might expect the fueling onto the central object to be resumed . with the increased accretion rates and luminosisties the cycle can be started again .",
    "although at lower frequencies ( i.e.  at larger scales ) the thermal pressure of the hot x - ray gas ( often forming a cooling flow ) may be enough to confine the radio sources ( e.g. fabbiano et a.  1987 ; 1988 ) the core regions of the jet are likely to be overpressured with respect to the x - ray gas ( see e.g.  fig.1 , where the larger scale emission seems to have been disrupted by the cooling ism gas at low frequencies and only expanding buoyantly through the medium ) .  taking the estimates of @xmath77 from  4 , we expect @xmath118 a few@xmath119 in the jets .",
    "the pressure in the x - ray gas , @xmath120 a few @xmath121 for central gas densities @xmath122 and typical temperatures @xmath123 ( dm00 ) .",
    "simple estimates of the energetics of the core also suggest that significant power from the radio source has been deposited in the inner x - ray gas .",
    "the rate of energy supplied to the ism is greater than just the radio luminosity , @xmath124 , and is at least @xmath125 where @xmath126 , is the ratio of jet distance from the central object ( @xmath127 ) to its radius @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the ratio of the jet to light speed , is typically @xmath130 for these weak sources .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the x - ray gas within @xmath131 ( which is often greater than the extent of the jets ) in the galaxies , @xmath132  ( e.g. ,  allen et al .",
    "2000 ) is @xmath133 , suggesting that the jet power has a strong effect on the thermal balance of the x - ray gas .",
    "note that although it is unclear whether the jets can heat most of the gas ( and not just as small fraction of it ) near the accretion radii of the systems , if the jets are overpressured with respect to the ism gas we expect that they will be widening sideways as they drive the shock into the surrounding gas and may therefore affect a large area ( begelman & cioffi 1990 ) .      in both of the models discussed in  4 the accretion rates onto the central black holes in early - type galaxies must be reduced with respect to the bondi estimates .",
    "the low radiative efficiencies of adafs are not enough to explain their low - luminosities . if mass loss is important , the accretion rates may only be reduced in the inner regions of the flows and the material may still be fed at the expected bondi rates in the outer regions , for a fixed temperature and density of the ism .",
    "if instead the ism is heated near the bondi radius the accretion rate may be suppressed at large radii and @xmath134 throughout the flows .",
    "follow - up x - ray observations will provide means for distinguishing between these two possibilities .",
    "as discussed in detail in dm00 , models with strong mass loss ( winds ) predict significant x - ray fluxes due to bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "most of the contribution to the bremsstrahlung luminosity comes from the outer regions of the flows where the accretion rate is high and the densities are also relatively high ( see e.g. figure 2 in dm00 ) .",
    "if @xmath76 is suppressed because jets / outflows heat the ism significantly in the outer regions of the flow , we expect the bremsstrahlung emission , which is @xmath135 , to be strongly reduced by a factor @xmath136",
    ". note that because of the low @xmath137 ratios in these sources ( @xmath138 ) , even if accretion was to occur via a standard thin disk the dominant x - ray emission mechanism would most likely be bremsstrahlung .",
    "we have argued that the @xmath139  asca hard x - ray power laws detected in a number of nearby ellipticals ( allen et al .",
    "2000 ) , if indeed produced by accretion around their central black holes , favors strong outflow models ( dm00 ) .",
    "observations with the chandra x - ray observatory are needed to clearly resolve the central sources in these objects . at present , because of the lack of a clear detection of nuclear x - ray emission , it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the accretion rates in these systems are simply much lower than those implied the bondi estimates .",
    "higher resolution vlba observations at high radio frequencies for @xmath140 should resolve scales as small as a few tens of @xmath141 and would therefore provide a crucial test for the presence of hot accretion flows in these systems .",
    "results from 15 ghz vlba imaging ( falcke et al .",
    "1999 ) of a sample of galaxies ( both ellipticals and spirals ) show that many radio cores may still be of non - thermal origin .",
    "further observations at higher frequencies are necessary to clearly determine the spectrum of the core emission .",
    "the relationship between the high - frequency radio flux and the estimated black hole masses can also provide some clues for explaining the quiescence of these systems .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that there is a direct relation between the 5 ghz radio cores in ellipticals and their central black hole masses , which may be accounted for by the thermal synchrotron emission from an adaf .",
    "if such a proposal is valid and a low-@xmath76 adaf ( fig .",
    "2 ) is indeed producing most of the emission , the relationship should hold at higher frequencies . in the next section we derive the expected relationship when outflows are present or when heating of the ism is occurring .",
    "the high frequency radio observations have allowed both the synchrotron flux and the position of the peak , if present , to be measured . in figure 4",
    "we plot the radio luminosity at 8 and 22 ghz versus the measured black hole masses for the seven objects ( from dm99 and the four here ) .",
    "although the sample is small and only spans a limited range of black hole masses , much smaller than that plotted in franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we can still compare our results to the relationship they have found .",
    "this allows us to see whether the franceschini et al .",
    "relationship holds at higher frequencies where the contribution from a potential adaf is most relevant .",
    "we also show that the presence of outflows in an adaf or of significant heating in the ism , would change the relationships between radio core flux and black hole masses .",
    "figure 4 shows the radio core luminosities and total radio luminosities for ngc 4649 , ngc 4472 , ngc 1399 , ngc 2300 , ngc 4594 , ngc 4278 and m87 plotted against their black hole masses .",
    "we plot the fluxes measured at 8 and 22 ghz together with the previously reported 5 ghz values ( we do not plot the @xmath9 ghz fluxes because at this frequency we only have firm detections for 4 objects ) .",
    "the relationship depicted from the fluxes measured at 22 ghz ( solid dots - figure 4 ) suggests that the high frequency core fluxes may be more strongly correlated to @xmath142 .",
    "note that the 5 ghz fluxes , would indicate a much flatter relationship between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "this suggests that the relatively weak , arcsec - scale radio jet components , which contribute more predominantly at lower frequencies may not be as as strongly correlated in this plane .    in figure 4",
    "we also show the expected correlation ( solid line ) between radio luminosisity and black hole mass for an adaf ( dashed line ; franceschini et al .",
    "1998 ) and for an adaf with winds ( dotted line ) .",
    "this relationship is obtained by noting that the rayleigh jeans part of the synchrotron spectrum scales as @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "for @xmath146 we have @xmath147 and given that @xmath148 and following franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) taking @xmath149 and @xmath150 with @xmath151 for ellipticals ( e.g.  magorrian et al .  1998 ) , we find , using eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath152 which recovers @xmath153 derived by franceschini et al . for the case of @xmath154 .",
    "relation ( 5 ) implies that the presence of outflows i.e. for @xmath155 steepens the relationship between core power and black hole mass .",
    "the solid line in figure 4 is the steep correlation @xmath156 obtained for @xmath55 .",
    "a few of the objects seem in better agreement with the steeper relationship , although a larger number of objects would be needed to distinguish any clear trend .",
    "note also that in their regression analysis for 8 objects , franceschini et al . found @xmath157 for the total and core radio luminosities respectively .",
    "we note that franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also plot objects like m31 and sgr a@xmath114 and their relationship extends down to @xmath158 . here",
    "we could also plot higher frequency radio measurements of those objects ( and e.g. ngc 4258 ) but for those systems bondi accretion from the ism would not apply as indicated by eq .",
    "8 and the expected relationship may be flatter with @xmath159 .",
    "relation ( 5 ) is only recovered where the bondi argument for the accretion rates can be applied .    the other possibility discussed above",
    "is that outflows stifle the accretion by reducing @xmath29 .",
    "this could be both due to the possibly poorly collimated outflows from the adaf or in any case to the observed radio jets present in all these systems . in this case",
    "we predict a different relationship between radio power and mass accretion rate .",
    "heating of the gas at the accretion radius implies an effective energy flux into the ism and a relationship with the central black hole mass given by , @xmath160 given that @xmath161 if heating by the jets is important we would also expect a strong dependence of the total radio power on the central black hole mass . in figure 5 we plot the radio power @xmath162 versus black hole mass . although the errors on the black hole mass estimates are not well - known and could easily be large , fig .",
    "5 seems to show a more consistent trend than figure 4 .",
    "the two most powerful radio sources in the sample , ngc 4278 and m87 , are the ones that depart the most from the above relation .",
    "in summary , figure 4 and 5 suggest that the radio power at high radio frequencies is likely to be a good tracer of black hole mass and useful for testing the accretion properties of these systems.the franceschini et al .",
    "relationship between core radio power and black hole mass may get steeper at higher frequencies or in the presence of outflows .",
    "obtaining a large enough sample of elliptical galaxies observed at high resolution at high radio frequencies spanning a larger range of measured black hole masses may be useful for discriminating whether the radio emission is due to the weak radio jets in these systems or an adaf component .",
    "in particular , with a statistical sample of objects one can test for the presence of strong outflows in adafs , or look for signs of interactions between jets and ism , which can lead to suppression of the accretion onto these systems . resolving the correlation between black hole mass and radio flux",
    "can therefore break the degeneracy between the two interpretations for the origin of the radio emission : the case for small accretion rates throughout the flows ( i.e.  the case where @xmath163 ) or the situation where most of the material is lost through a wind and small amounts are accreted onto the black holes , @xmath164 .",
