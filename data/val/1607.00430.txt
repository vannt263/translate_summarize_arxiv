    "relative to three - dimensional objects , this measure of slenderness allows for enormous mathematical simplification in accurately describing the physical dynamics of strings , filaments and rods .",
    "it is thus perhaps not surprising that the physics of strings have been the subject of intense study for centuries @xcite , and indeed their investigation substantially pre - dates the birth of three - dimensional elasticity .    following the pioneering work of galileo on the bending of cantilevers , one - dimensional analytical models of beams date back to 1761 when jakob bernoulli first introduced the use of differential equations to capture the relation between geometry and bending resistance in a _",
    "planar elastica _",
    ", that is an elastic curve deforming in a two - dimensional space .",
    "this attempt was then progressively refined by huygens , leibniz and johann bernoulli @xcite , until euler presented a full solution of the planar elastica , obtained by minimizing the strain energy and by recognizing the relation between flexural stiffness and material and geometric properties .",
    "euler also showed the existence of bifurcating solutions in a rod subject to compression , identifying its first buckling mode , while lagrange formalized the corresponding multi - modal solution @xcite .",
    "non - planar deformations of the elastica were first tackled by kirchhoff @xcite and clebsch @xcite who envisioned a rod as an assembly of short undeformable straight segments with dynamics determined by contact forces and moments , leading to three - dimensional configurations .",
    "later , love @xcite approached the problem from a lagrangian perspective characterizing a filament by contiguous cross sections that can rotate relative to each other , but remain undeformed and perpendicular to the centerline of the rod at all times ; in modern parlance this assumption is associated with dynamics on the rotation group so(3 ) at every cross - section .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion capture the ability of the filament to bend and twist , but not shear or stretch .",
    "eventually the cosserat brothers @xcite relaxed the assumption of inextensibility and cross - section orthogonality to the centerline , deriving a general mathematical framework that accommodates all six possible degrees of freedom associated with bending , shearing , twisting and stretching , effectively formulating dynamics on the full euclidean group se(3 ) .",
    "the availability of these strong mathematical foundations @xcite prompted a number of discrete computational models @xcite that allow for the exploration of a range of physical phenomena .",
    "these include , for example , the study of polymers and dna @xcite , elastic and viscous threads @xcite , botanical applications @xcite , elastic ribbons @xcite , woven cloth @xcite and tangled hair @xcite . because the scaled ratio of the stretching and shearing stiffness to the bending stiffness for slender filaments is @xmath3 , the assumption of inextensibility and unshearability is usually appropriate , justifying the widespread use of the kirchhoff model in the aforementioned applications .    however , new technologies such as soft robotics and artificial muscles are generating applications for highly deformable elastomeric filamentous structures @xcite for which the assumption of inextensibility and unshearability is no longer valid .",
    "motivated by these advancements , we move away from the kirchhoff model in favor of the complete cosserat theory .",
    "we present a numerical scheme that tracks both the rod centerline and local frame allowing for bending , twist , shear and stretch @xcite consistent with the full euclidean group se(3 ) , while retaining the hamiltonian structure of the system and fast discrete operators .",
    "this allows us to substantially increase the spectrum of problems amenable to be treated via this class of rod models .",
    "moving beyond the passive mechanics of single filaments , we also account for the interaction between filaments and complex environments with a number of additional biological and physical features , including muscular activity , self - contact and contact with solid boundaries , isotropic and anisotropic surface friction and viscous interaction with a fluid .",
