    "the search for signatures of classical chaos in corresponding quantum systems is one of the main themes of quantum chaos .",
    "the literature in this subject is large , much of it described in recent books by haake and by stckmann @xcite .",
    "here we consider a simple version of this question , namely , we describe a semi - classical calculation of the short time spreading of a wave - packet for the quantum version of a classically chaotic system and show , as one might expect , that it is governed to a large extent by the lyapunov exponents characterizing the exponential separation of close trajectories of the classical system .",
    "we consider a lorentz gas , which consists of a particle , or a collection of non - interacting particles , moving in @xmath0-dimensions among a collection of fixed scatterers , generally taken to be @xmath0-dimensional hard spheres , with finite horizon .",
    "the case where the scatterers are centered at the vertices of a regular lattice is the sinai billiard .",
    "related work on this problem has been done by wirzba @xcite , which will be mentioned in section ii .",
    "we consider the propagator for a semi - classical particle moving among the scatterers .",
    "the de broglie wave length of the moving particle is taken to be small compared both to the size of a scatterer and to the average distance between scatterers .",
    "the propagator is evaluated by semi - classical methods for time intervals where a number of collisions take place .",
    "as long as the wave - packet remains small , its spreading with time is governed by a set of equations that are the quantum counterparts to the curvature equations of sinai and co - workers @xcite that determine the lyapunov exponents and kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy for the classical system .",
    "we can then easily relate the spreading of the wave - packet to the classical lyapunov exponents .",
    "next we apply this result to a calculation of the wave - packet auto - correlation function ( the return probability ) , @xmath1 , defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath4 is an initial quantum state .",
    "we find that , for wave packets on periodic orbits , this function exhibits a series of maxima , with amplitudes decreasing mainly exponentially with time , as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the classical ks - entropy , and the @xmath7 are the positive lyapunov exponents for the corresponding periodic orbits .",
    "this type of decay of the auto - correlation function was first described by heller @xcite .",
    "here we also calculate the coefficient in front of the exponential .",
    "this coefficient has a sub - exponential time dependence .",
    "the auto - correlation function exhibits a set of maxima separated by deep minima that appear for simple physical reasons , as we explain in section iii .",
    "these results are limited in applicability to times _ less than the ehrenfest time _ , which is the time necessary for a wave packet to spread to the size of a scatterer",
    ". however , there is an application of them to the loschmidt echo , or quantum fidelity , of a special type which is valid for a much larger time interval , greater than the ehrenfest time .",
    "the loschmidt echo @xcite , @xmath8 , is defined by @xmath9 here @xmath3 is the hamiltonian for the system , @xmath10 is a small perturbing hamiltonian , and @xmath11 is some initial quantum state . for the case that @xmath3 is the lorentz gas hamiltonian with hard sphere scatterers , and the perturbation is a small change in the mass of the moving particle , it is straightforward to show that @xmath8 is equal to the wave - packet autocorrelation function evaluated at a scaled time , which can be made to be much shorter than the physical time @xmath12 , by choosing a suitably small mass perturbation .",
    "therefore _ for this special perturbation _ and hard sphere lorentz gas system , the quantum fidelity can be evaluated for very long times , if one knows the behavior of the auto - correlation function for a much shorter time interval",
    ".    an earlier version of this paper @xcite contained the claim that the loschmidt echo , defined above , decays over some time interval as @xmath13 .",
    "this claim is wrong , and our reasons for reaching this conclusion will be discussed in section iii . this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we construct the semi - classical propagator for the moving particle and show that when it is used to determine the time evolution of a small initial gaussian wave packet , the spreading of the wave packet is , for times less than the ehrenfest time , determined by the classical curvature equations @xcite .",
    "these equations describe the rate of spreading of a classical , infinitesimal trajectory bundle . in section iii",
    ", we apply this result to calculate the wave - packet auto - correlation function for periodic orbits , as an illustration of the behavior predicted and described by heller @xcite . in section",
    "iv we derive an exact expression for the loschmidt echo , @xmath8 , for a quantum particle moving in a hard sphere lorentz gas , where the perturbed hamiltonian is obtained from the unperturbed one by a small change of the mass of the moving particle .",
    "this result allows us to describe the behavior of the echo for long physical times in terms of the short time behavior of the wave packet auto - correlation function , @xmath1 .",
    "we also discuss the error in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the calculations in these sections are for two - dimensional systems with hard disk scatterers .",
    "the three dimensional version of this work is presented in section v. here we show that the role of the positive lyapunov exponent in our calculations for two dimensional systems is taken by ks entropy , _",
    "i.e. _ by the sum of the two positive lyapunov exponents for the three dimensional system .",
    "we summarize our results in section vi .",
    "we consider the semi - classical motion in two dimensions , @xmath14 , of a gaussian wave packet , with average momentum @xmath15 , whose initial form is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the de broglie wavelength of the moving particle , @xmath18 and @xmath19 characterize the size of the wave packet in the @xmath20- and @xmath21-directions respectively ( @xmath22 denotes the real part ) .",

    "consider a wave packet centered around @xmath42 at time @xmath43 before a collision and around @xmath24 at @xmath12 after the collision , fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "the system of reference originates at the point of classical collision .",
    "we suppose that the wave - packet to which the propagator will be applied is sufficiently small that we only need to find classical trajectories by minimizing the action for points starting close to @xmath42 and ending close to @xmath24 at time @xmath12 .",
    "we then write the action , @xmath44 , for a trajectory from @xmath45 , @xmath46 , colliding with a scatterer at point @xmath47 and arriving at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , at time , @xmath12 , as @xmath50 the variation of this action with respect to the point of collision , @xmath47 , leads to an extremum equation that is used to determine the collision point , @xmath47 .",

    "second , the wave packet size is assumed to be much smaller than the distance @xmath60 between the center of the wave packet and the point where the particle would , classically , collide with the scatterer .",
    "this assumption makes it possible to expand the coordinates of points connected by the propagator about corresponding wave packet centers .",

    "we suppose that the perturbed hamiltonian is obtained from the unperturbed one by changing the mass of the moving particle , from @xmath29 to @xmath191 .",
    "the identity depends on the fact that for hard scatterers , no matter what their shape , the eigenfunctions depend on wave numbers rather than on the mass of the moving particle .",
    "that is , the sets of eigenfunctions for particles of different masses are the same , only the values of the energy corresponding to the same wave numbers differ .",
    "the wave functions are the solutions of the scalar helmholtz equation @xmath192 which satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition that @xmath193 vanishes on the surface of each scatterer , and on the boundaries of the system .",

    "( [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable thing about this result is the fact that although for long times a small wave packet will spread over large distances , the loschmidt echo in this case is determined by the short time spreading of the wave packet , even if the physical time is quite large . as mentioned in section iii , the exact result , eq .",
