    "cluster - cluster aggregation ( cca ) refers to the statistical dynamics of a large collection of particles ( or clusters ) which move around under the action of some transport process and which , in addition , have a probability to coalesce irreversibly when they collide . the transport is usually stochastic , diffusion being a commonly studied case , and coalescence of clusters conserves mass . in general , both the rate of coalescence and the transport coefficient are functions of cluster mass .",
    "such dynamics are relevant to many physical phenomena .",
    "commonly cited applications include the study of aerosols @xcite , the development of structure in the expanding universe @xcite , clustering of algae @xcite and cloud droplet coalescence @xcite . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", cca can be modelled using relatively simple interacting particle systems and can thus provide a testing ground for statistical mechanics theories of complex systems .",
    "the theoretical objective is to understand the statistical properties of the mass distribution of the clusters .",
    "cca is an intrinsically non - equilibrium process .",
    "aggregation is irreversible so there is no possibility for the statistical dynamics to have detailed balance .",
    "in some circumstances it may be appropriate to consider fragmentation of clusters in addition to aggregation .",
    "in such cases , detailed balance may be achievable .",
    "we do not consider such situations here however .",
    "two different scenarios may be studied which we refer to as the decay and forced cases . in the decay case ,",
    "the more common of the two , the system is initially populated with a large number of small particles ( monomers ) which are considered to be the fundamental unit for the aggregation process and whose mass can accordingly be taken to be one .",
    "the size distribution subsequently spreads in the space of cluster masses as larger clusters are generated by the aggregation of smaller ones .",
    "this time evolution proceeds for all time ( we do not consider models exhibiting a gelation transition here ) often in a self - similar fashion . in the forced case , the system initially has no clusters but we continually deposit monomers into the system at a constant rate from an external source .",
    "the size distribution again spreads in the mass space but , due to the constant replenishment of the monomers by the external source , eventually reaches a stationary state at any given cluster size . in this stationary state ,",
    "the depletion of clusters of a given size by aggregation events is exactly balanced by the formation of such clusters by the aggregation of smaller ones .",
    "this results in a constant flux of mass in the mass space .",
    "an analogy may be drawn with the flux of energy through scales in the kolmogorov cascade of hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "we shall be concerned primarily with the stationary forced case .",
    "the most basic statistical measure is the average mass density , @xmath1 , giving the average density of clusters of mass @xmath2 at time @xmath3 . at the mean - field level",
    ", @xmath1 satisfies the smoluchowski equation @xcite . for many applications , the collision kernel in the smoluchowski equation , which reflects the mass dependence of the underlying microscopic coalescence rates , is a homogeneous function",
    "whose degree we shall denote by @xmath4 . for a broad class of such kernels , the smoluchowski equation has self - similar solutions which describe scaling behaviour of @xmath1 in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 has power law asymptotics for @xmath1 as a function of mass . in the decay case",
    ", we often find @xmath5 . in the forced case ,",
    "the stationary state is given by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the reviews by by aldous @xcite and leyvraz @xcite provide comprehensive discussions of the smoluchowski equation and its scaling solutions .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of cca is that this mean field description can fail under certain conditions .",
    "this results in a transition to a fluctuation dominated regime with completely different scaling properties for the large @xmath2 asymptotics .",
    "the fundamental assumption underpinning mean field theory is the absence of spatial correlations . in particular , the joint distribution of clusters having masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 at a given point , @xmath9 , which is linked to the probability of collision , factorises as the product of the one - point distributions of clusters with masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 . likewise for higher order joint distributions .",
    "this works well in the so - called reaction limited regime when the density of clusters is sufficiently high that each aggregating cluster has a large number of potential partners to with which to aggregate . in the most commonly considered case ,",
    "in which the transport process is simple diffusion , this assumption turns out to be inconsistent for large masses if the spatial dimension is less than or equal to two .",
    "the reason is that in two dimensions and below random walks are recurrent so that clusters which encounter each other once are highly probable to do so infinitely many times and hence to aggregate .",
    "heavy clusters thereby generate an effective depletion zone around themselves .",
    "the dynamics thus becomes diffusion limited and dominated by diffusive fluctuations making the system much more difficult to analyse .",
    "the only case for which a systematic study of the diffusion limited regime has been done is the case of constant kernel in which the aggregation rate is independent of mass ( @xmath10 ) . for the forced case in @xmath11 , the diffusion limited stationary mass density can be shown to scale as @xmath12 which is shallower than the corresponding mean - field prediction , @xmath13 .",
    "note that the diffusion limited scaling exponent coincides with the reaction limited one when @xmath14 which reflects the fact that @xmath14 is the critical dimension for this model .",
    "in addition to having a different value for the scaling exponent of @xmath15 , the statistical properties of the diffusion limited regime are also structurally different : higher order correlation functions exhibit multi - scaling in the sense that they do not scale as powers of the corresponding single - point densities as they do in the mean field regime .    in this article",
    "we focus in detail on this transition from mean field to fluctuation dominated regime in cca .",
    "the fact that the parameter controlling the transition is the physical dimension of the model is inconvenient for both numerical exploration and physical applicability .",
    "we remark that the important ingredient for the application of mean field theory is not the physical dimension per se but rather whether or not the transport mechanism has the ability to break spatial correlations between particles .",
    "we show that by replacing diffusive transport with lvy flights it is possible to continuously tune between fluctuation - dominated behaviour and mean - field behaviour _ even in one dimension_. the tuning parameter is the characteristic exponent of the lvy distribution underlying the jump size distribution for particle hops .",
    "the physical intuition is that correlations between particles are broken even in low dimensions if there are sufficiently many long range hops to effectively mix the clusters .",
    "we also explore the special role played in the forced case by the second order mass correlation function whose scaling exponent is strongly universal as a result of the so - called constant flux relation ( cfr ) @xcite .",
    "its scaling exponent is , perhaps surprisingly , independent of both the spatial transport mechanism and the physical dimension and is always given by its mean field value .    the outline of the article is as follows .",
    "we begin by defining the stochastic model used in studying cca , as well as a brief overview of the statistical field theory used in deriving the lee - cardy equation for this model ( section 2 ) .",
    "then , we summarise the scaling properties of the multi - particle correlation functions or arbitrary order as applied to both reaction - limited and diffusion - limited regimes ( section 3 ) .",
    "using the constant flux relation ( cfr ) we then derive the scaling invariance of the flux - carrying correlation function , demonstrating that this result is independent of the dimension of the system and of the mechanism of spatial transport ( section 4 ) . implementing lvy flights for the one - dimensional model , we then characterise the suggested form of the mass density as a function of the lvy exponent , which we validate against numerical simulation together with taking direct measurements for the integrated forms of the mass correlation functions ( section 5 ) . here",
    "we verify the scaling independence of the flux - carrying correlation function as we alter the spatial transport mechanism .",
    "we finish the paper by determining a predicted form for the structure of the depletion zones as a function of the lvy exponent ( section 6 ) , which we validate numerically before providing a conclusion .",
    "we now describe a simple stochastic model , first introduced without injection of particles in @xcite and with injection of particles in @xcite , which can be used to study the phenomenon of cca . discrete particles , each carrying a mass index , @xmath2 , occupy a @xmath16-dimensional square lattice , @xmath17 , with no restrictions on the number of particles occupying each lattice site .",
    "we take the mass index to be a non - negative integer multiple of a fundamental mass , @xmath18 .",
    "this means that all particles are composed of clusters of a single basic monomer unit .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath3 is characterised by the set of occupation numbers , @xmath19 , specifying the number of particles of each mass @xmath2 at each point , @xmath9 of the lattice .",
    "the occupation numbers evolve in time according to the following microscopic dynamical transitions which occur in continuous time with exponentially distributed waiting times :    * diffusion : a particle at any site may hop to an adjacent site .",
    "these hops occur at rate @xmath20 , taken to be independent of particle mass .",
    "* injection of monomers : a new monomer may appear at any site on @xmath17 . the injection of monomers takes place at rate @xmath21 . * aggregation : two particles having masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are at the same lattice point , @xmath9 , may aggregate to create a single new particle having mass @xmath22 .",
    "this occurs at rate @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reaction rate , taken to be independent of mass , and the @xmath19 factors encode the pairwise nature of the aggregation process ( the kronecker symbol , @xmath25 , ensures that the rate is correct when two particles of the same mass aggregate ) .",
    "the  rates \" in these rules refer to the corresponding waiting times .",
    "these rules define a markov chain which can be easily simulated using the gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "all numerical results presented in this paper have been obtained in this fashion .",
    "this model has a master equation whose solution can be used to compute averages with respect to the microscopic dynamics .",
    "such averages , which we shall denote by @xmath26 , are equivalent to averages with respect to the effective action of an associated statistical field theory .",
    "this effective action is obtained from the dynamical rules by the well known doi - peliti construction . for details of the procedure for this specific model see @xcite . for many microscopic models describing interacting particle systems , averages with respect to this effective action are further equivalent to averages with respect to solutions of a stochastic rate equation @xcite known as the lee - cardy equation . the lee - cardy equation specific to our cca model , first derived in @xcite , takes the form of a stochastic smoluchowski equation . in the continuous limit",
    "it takes the form :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is gaussian white noise and @xmath29 is the @xmath16-dimensional laplacian .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the diffusion constant , reaction rate and mass injection rate obtained from an appropriate rescaling of the corresponding microscopic rates with the lattice spacing in the continuous limit @xcite .",
    "we shall denote averages with respect to the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq - sse ] ) by @xmath33 .",
    "one of the most striking aspects of the lee - cardy equation is that the noise term is imaginary indicating that the field @xmath34 can not be literally interpreted as the density of particles , @xmath19 , however tempting such an identification may seem .",
    "imaginary noise encodes the fact that the particles in the system are anti - correlated @xcite .",
    "physically , this anti - correlation comes about since the process of aggregation tends , on average , to produce a depletion zone around each particle .",
    "we shall discuss these depletion zones in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec - anticorrelations ] .",
    "careful study of the construction leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq - sse ] ) leads to the conclusion @xcite that single point _",
    "moments _ of @xmath34 correspond to _ factorial moments _ of the physical density , @xmath19 : @xmath35 multi - point moments translate directly .",
    "for example , @xmath36 these relations allow us to translate correlation functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq - sse ] ) which are most suitable for theoretical analysis into corresponding correlation functions in the original lattice model which are most suitable for numerical measurements . in relation to the interpretation of the field @xmath34 alluded to above , eq .",
    "( [ eq - phinrelation ] ) tells us that @xmath34 is equal to the density , @xmath19 , on average but differs in distribution .",
    "if the occupation numbers are large , we can , to leading order , ignore the distinction between moments and factorial moments on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq - phinrelation ] ) . furthermore ,",
    "if we could neglect correlations between particles , higher order correlation functions could be factorised into products of densities : @xmath37 this is the essence of the mean field approximation for cca .",
    "if the density exhibits scaling with some physical quantity such as the mass or the source strength , it follows from the mean field approximation that the higher order correlation functions exhibit simple scaling . that is to say that if the density has a scaling exponent , @xmath38 , then the corresponding scaling exponent of an order @xmath39 correlation function is @xmath40 .",
    "we have already mentioned that the interactions between particles resulting from aggregation provides a natural mechanism for generating anti - correlations between particles .",
    "the extent to which the approximation ( [ eq - meanfieldapprox ] ) is a good one therefore depends on the strength of these anti - correlations .",
    "it has been understood that in low dimensions the large time , large mass behaviour is always diffusion limited resulting in anticorrelations between particles which are sufficiently strong to invalidate the mean field approximation .",
    "low dimensions in this case means @xmath11 with the case @xmath14 being marginal .",
    "one expects to observe a violation of mean field theory accompanied by the onset of multiscaling as one varies the dimension of the lattice @xmath17 .",
    "this is indeed true with strong multiscaling observed in both the decaying @xcite and forced @xcite cases in @xmath41 which mellows to logarithmic corrections to the mean - field scaling in @xmath14 .",
    "triggering this transition from mean - field to non - mean - field behaviour by varying the spatial dimension is not very easy in practice . in sec .",
    "[ sec - levy ] of this article we show that introducing long - range diffusion can break the anti - correlations between particles resulting in behaviour which is very reminiscent of mean - field behaviour _ even in one dimension_. before this however we will review the scaling properties of cca with regular diffusion .",
    "a constant injection of monomers into the system allows for the creation of a non - equilibrium stationary state , which is characterised by a constant flux of mass from smaller to larger masses under aggregation .",
    "however , since there is no upper mass limit defined on the system , the creation of arbitrarily large clusters can go on indefinitely . in this sense , the stationary state is only defined for some inertial range of masses .",
    "any stationary solution to the stochastic smoluchowski equation describing the mass density must therefore be of kolmogorov type @xcite .",
    "that is , these solutions exhibit scaling evocative of the kolmogorov spectrum found in forced hydrodynamic turbulence , with a cascade defined by a constant flux of mass from smaller to larger clusters mediated by the aggregation of particles . from this point on",

    "the stationary density should depend on the mass flux , @xmath32 .",
    "there are two natural ways to construct an expression with the correct dimension using only one additional parameter in addition to the flux : @xmath46 the first corresponds to the reaction - limited regime in which diffusion plays no role .",

    "the legitimacy or otherwise of this neglect is likely to be somehow related to the question of the locality of the mass cascade ( see @xcite for some discussion ) .",
    "this is a tricky issue in general and will require further work .",
    "to summarise , we have studied in detail , the scaling properties of one dimensional stationary cca with lvy flights .",
    "we have demonstrated that the transition from mean field statistics to fluctuation dominated statistics usually observed as the physical dimension is tuned through two from above , can be mimicked in one dimension by varying the characteristic exponent , @xmath0 , of the jump size distribution of the lvy flights .",
    "this is physically reasonable since the introduction of long range hops provides a mechanism to weaken correlations between particles in the system and may erase them entirely if they are sufficiently frequent .",
    "our predicted values for the scaling exponent of the mass density as a function of @xmath0 based on dimensional arguments agreed well with numerical simulations of the underlying stochastic particle system .",
    "we also provided a direct demonstration of the strong universality of the scaling exponent of the mass - flux - carrying correlation function in the stationary state .",
    "it is independent of both the physical dimension and the value of @xmath0 as expected from theoretical considerations .",
    "finally we performed detailed investigations of the spatial structure of the depletion zones surrounding heavy particles in stationary cca with both regular diffusion and lvy flights .",
    "our results indicate that in the case of regular diffusion , the exact results of @xcite describing the multiscaling of correlation functions in the decaying @xmath117 model , have direct analogues for stationary cca . in the case of lvy flights ,",
    "our numerical studies suggest that the two - point correlation function measuring the anti - correlation between particles in the system vanishes with a non - trivial fractional power of the separation between the particles as this separation decreases to zero . using our knowledge of the exact scaling for the flux - carrying correlation function we put forward a scaling argument that this power should be @xmath133 .",
    "this scaling is consistent with numerical observations but further efforts will be required to make it definitive .    it is not immediately evident how to extend the methods employed in @xcite to account for lvy flights since the fractional laplacian entering the propagator of effective field theory seems difficult to obtain from the operator representation of the master equation .",
    "a direct calculation from the master equation seems equally daunting .",
    "nevertheless we expect that some progress in this direction could and should be made .",
    "this will greatly clarify the scaling arguments presented in this article .",
    "several interesting extensions could be made to the model in order to make it more physically realistic .",
    "one would be to introduce mass - dependent diffusion , for example , and allowing the diffusion rate to decrease as a power of the mass , @xmath141 , as one would expect for real particles .",
    "another would be to replace the lvy flights with lvy walks to account for the fact that physical particles can not instantaneously make long range jumps .",
    "we know that neither of these modifications would affect the scaling exponent , @xmath69 of the two - point function which is fixed by the cfr alone .",
    "the value of @xmath38 and indeed @xmath57 for @xmath142 are , however , expected to be sensitive to such modifications and would considerably complicate the picture .",
    "another natural extension would be to ask similar questions about the structure of anticorrelations in the so - called charge model with lvy diffusion .",
    "the charge model @xcite is a closely related model in which masses ( or charges ) can take positive and negative values .",
    "when the rates of injection of positive and negative charges are equal , the flux @xmath32 is zero on average so that the scaling arguments presented here fail . instead of an exact conservation law for charge one instead",
    "has a statistical conservation law for charge squared .",
    "this was used to derive the cfr ( @xmath143 ) for the charge model in @xcite . repeating the dimensional arguments leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq - dalevy ] ) in arbitrary dimension taking @xmath32 to be the average flux of @xmath144 gives @xmath145 as a first guess for the charge model scaling .",
    "in @xmath41 one has @xmath146 which gives the diffusion limited result @xmath147 when @xmath99 and the mean - field answer @xmath148 when @xmath107 , both of which are known from @xcite .",
