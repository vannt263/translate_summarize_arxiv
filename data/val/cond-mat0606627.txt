    "proposals for quantum computing architectures based on semiconductor devices@xcite are attractive for their scalability ; once the few - qubit problem is solved , massive scalability is not expected to pose insurmountable barriers either in resource requirements or fabrication precision .",
    "this is primarily due to the sustained and continued improvements in epitaxy and lithography over the past few decades , and the ability with which new techniques , often developed in industry , are transferred to basic research laboratories . on the other hand , semiconductor environments are hardly systems of pristine quality and isolation , and there are severe trade - offs between long coherence times and short access times .",
    "pure spin qubits , for example , couple relatively weakly to their environment.@xcite their dipole tails are often negligibly weak and spin exchange effects , while potentially strong , are short range . but precisely because of this weak environmental coupling , spin qubits may be potentially difficult to control and manipulate . for single - particle qubits , local zeeman tuning is required to rotate bits .",
    "the opposite scenario is often true for charge qubits . here",
    ", control may be attained very quickly with metallic gates or optics.@xcite however relaxation and decoherence times can be very fast , requiring even faster switching times .",
    "this begs the question of whether there exist hybrid qubits which accentuate the positives and mitigate the negatives .",
    "we show below that this does indeed seem the case if a single qubit is judiciously defined as a correlated few - body system whose charge and spin degrees of freedom are entangled .",
    "these strong correlations should additionally be effective at suppressing relaxation and decoherence through single - particle channels .",
    "indeed our two orthogonal qubit states are identical in their single - particle spin and charge degrees of freedom ; differences only show up in their two - body correlation functions .",
    "sources of decoherence and dissipation can also be broadly classified as spin based or charge based . both destroy the unitary dynamics of the system either by taking it outside the computational subspace , or by remaining within the computational subspace , but causing either uncontrolled qubit flips , or pure dephasing without dissipation of energy .",
    "this will generally occur whenever an environmental influence couples differently to each qubit state .",
    "for example , if the two qubit states differ in their spin , then random magnetic fields are an issue . for single - particle qubits , this will always be the case , and likewise for two - particle qubits ; it is not possible to define two orthogonal one- or two - particle states with identical spin and charge densities .",
    "a three particle system , however , can be constructed in which _ both _ the charge density and the spin of the two orthogonal @xmath0 and @xmath1 states are identical .",
    "we show that the qubits we define below admit a universal set of one and two - qubit gates , and we give explicit gate pulse sequences which implement this universal set .",
    "we also discuss issues of decoherence and relaxation among the qubits and show that , for a broad class of environments , including certain spin dependent ones , relaxation and dephasing are absent ( @xmath5 ) within the lowest - order born - markov approximation .",
    "we expect the residual decoherence rate due to higher - order couplings , non - markovian effects , and other , weakly coupled , environments to be small .",
    "we also discuss extensions to the model of system - environment coupling , and comment on issues of state preparation and detection .",
    "in the following section , we describe our model electronic hamiltonian consisting of two many - body parabolic - elliptic quantum dots , with long - range intradot coulomb repulsion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qubit - construction ] we construct our qubits and demonstrate how correlations produce orthogonal @xmath0 and @xmath1 states with identical spin and single - particle charge densities .",
    "section  [ sec : univ - quant - logic ] contains explicit implementations  in the form of pulse sequences  for a universal set of quantum logic gates ( hadamard , @xmath4 , phase , and cnot gates ) .",
    "section  [ sec : decoh - diss ] demonstrates that , to lowest order , intra - qubit relaxation and dephasing is absent for all pure spin and pure charge environments which couple to the qubit through single - particle channels . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : init - meas ] , we briefly discuss issues of state preparation and detection .",
    "we consider two coupled dots with hamiltonian @xmath6 where the first two terms denote the individual quantum dots whereas the third denotes interdot coupling . for @xmath7 , we shall take a simple coupling hamiltonian but , within each quantum dot , we shall take full long - range repulsive interactions into account ( exactly ) .",
    "we first focus on a single qubit and subsequently discuss two - qubit interactions .",
    "we encode a single qubit in a single elliptically confined@xcite two - dimensional lateral quantum dot .",
    "we place three interacting electrons in the dot and consider the two - dimensional subspace spanned by the @xmath8 spin sector .",
    "single qubit rotations are created by tuning the eccentricity of the elliptic confinement potential,@xcite whereas two - qubit operations , as we show below , are created by controlling the coupling between two adjacent quantum dots.@xcite    the hamiltonian of a single dot is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 we take a magnetic field @xmath11 perpendicular to the plane of the dot .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : elliphamil ] ) can be exactly diagonalized with canonical bose operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 and their hermitian conjugates as@xcite @xmath14 where    @xmath15    we build many - body states through antisymmetrized products of single - particle states @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "is derived in ref .",
    "for definiteness , we consider three singly - occupied orbitals @xmath22 corresponding to the three lowest - energy orbitals in the lowest landau level . with this orbital occupation ,",
    "the @xmath23 subspace is two - dimensional and is spanned by our orthogonal qubit states    [ eq : qubits ] @xmath24    each term on the right is a single antisymmetrized state : @xmath25 , where the operator @xmath26 creates an electron in state @xmath27 .",

    "[ ] ; however , the electron states differ in their orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "( [ eq : qubits ] ) can not be written as single slater determinants in _ any _ single - particle basis ; they are correlated states with entangled spin and charge degrees of freedom .",

    "[ fig : two - body ] for @xmath36 .",
    "because both the single - particle charge and spin properties for both qubit states are identical , intra - qubit decoherence and dissipation should be minimized .",
    "we show below that , within the lowest - order born and markov approximations , the @xmath37 and @xmath38 times are infinite for a very large class of environmental models . before doing so , however , we first show that a complete universal set of logic gates is achievable in this system .",

    "( [ eq : qubits ] ) , the electronic hamiltonian  ( [ eq : elliphamil ] ) can be written as a pseudospin-1/2 particle in a pseudomagnetic field . in this particular case , we have@xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 the pauli spin matrices and @xmath42 the identity matrix . the pseudomagnetic field components @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are given by    [ eq : pseudofield ] @xmath46    where @xmath47 are exchange ( and @xmath48 direct ) matrix elements , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vmatel ] ) with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . explicit ( exact , analytic ) expressions of these are given in refs .",
    "the main point with regard to qubit rotations is that the fields in eq .",

    "thus , adiabatically controlling either @xmath52 or @xmath53 can rotate qubits.@xcite these ratios may be changed at _ fixed _ magnetic field ( @xmath54 ) by altering the two confinement frequencies @xmath55 and @xmath56 independently .    to perform an arbitrary computation , we require a universal set of quantum logic gates which typically consists of both single and double qubit operations .",
    "we focus first on the single - qubit portion of this universal set , followed by the two - qubit portion , the cnot gate .      a universal set@xcite of quantum logic gates is given by the cnot gate , which we discuss below , and the single - qubit hadamard gate @xmath57 , @xmath58 gate @xmath59 , and phase gate @xmath60 .",

    "environmental influences can be of two distinct types : slow variations in the electromagnetic environment merely lead to adiabatic changes in the pseudofield @xmath90 and thus to unitary errors that typically average out over the length of a pulse.@xcite we look first to fast , non - adiabatic environmental influences that can lead to non - unitary errors  i.e . , decoherence  followed by a discussion on adiabatic influences which lead to gate errors .",
    "assuming the environment does not change the number of particles on the dot , and that the bath couples only to single particles in the dot , then a general model of system - bath coupling is given by @xmath91 where the sum is over all repeated indices .",
    "@xmath92 is a set of arbitrary operators which describe the reservoir and all relevant coupling constants .    at time @xmath87 , the full state - vector of the system @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) is a non - separable state , where the states @xmath95 are reservoir states including all time - dependent coefficients .",

( [ eq : born - markov ] ) states that relaxation and dephasing within the computational space are negligible to leading order for all environmental couplings which are either purely charge or purely spin in character .",
    "the former has @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsb ] ) and consequently @xmath103 , whereas the latter has @xmath104 and consequently @xmath105 . for both these cases ,",
    "dephasing and relaxation vanish within the born - markov approximation .",
    "( neither of these is applicable for hyperfine environments which depend on _ both _ spin and charge . )",
    "regarding adiabatic ( unitary ) influences , which do not cause decoherence , these can be minimized by choosing settings for the confinement potential such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are small in magnitude .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the values @xmath108 and @xmath109 . for these values of the confinement , we find @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 . for gaas material parameters , with @xmath113  mev ,",
    "this gives @xmath114ev  at least an order of magnitude smaller than typical pseudofield magnitudes . with these , we can estimate corrections to the adiabatic limit@xcite expressed as a leakage time given by @xmath115 , where @xmath116  mev is the excitation energy to states outside the qubit space , and @xmath117  ghz is the rate of typical gate operation . for these parameter values ,",
    "we find @xmath118 , and a leakage probability of only @xmath119 .",
    "with regard to state initialization , we note that if the qubit states are the lowest - energy states , then preparation becomes merely a matter of thermalization . in this case",
    ", potentials other than elliptic may well prove useful.@xcite ideally , a system where the two qubit states are the two lowest - energy states would be beneficial not only for state preparation , but also for a more general deterrent to dissipation , especially relaxation to states outside the computational basis .",
    "finally , with regard to measurement , we note that the two states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubits ] ) are not degenerate .",
    "thus , a destructive measurement is possible by detecting whether a fourth electron resonantly tunnels onto the ( three - particle ) dot ; similarly to the single - shot readout of individual quantum dot spin,@xcite the gates may be pulsed such that an additional electron can tunnel onto the dot only if it is in the higher - energy qubit state .",
    "in fact , since the tunnel barriers as well as the confinement itself is determined ( and controlled ) by the applied electrostatic potential , the universal set of gates described above as well as detection may be accomplished using already - existing@xcite experimental techniques ."
