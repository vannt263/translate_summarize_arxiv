    "the goal of this paper is to introduce a mathematically transparent treatment of spatial infinity for open universes in the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity @xcite with vanishing cosmological constant and to determine the phase space structure of the resulting theory .",
    "we consider universes of general genus @xmath0 and with @xmath1 massive spinning particles and work with the hamiltonian formulation of the chern - simons formalism .    in general terms , the boundary requirement for an open universe with vanishing cosmological constant which we study in this paper is that there be an asymptotic region of spacetime which has the geometry of a spinning cone @xcite .",
    "the implementation of this requirement in any hamiltonian formulation of gravity requires the introduction of boundary degrees of freedom , defined in the asymptotic region of spacetime .",
    "these boundary degrees of freedom should then be coupled to the bulk degrees of freedom in such a way that the resulting equations of motion ensure the required conical geometry in the asymptotic region .",
    "the precise formulation of the boundary requirement and its implementation in the metric formulation of gravity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions are discussed in detail in @xcite , which is a key reference for this paper . technically , the treatment in @xcite is quite involved since it is formulated in terms of conditions on the metric in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity .",
    "it requires the introduction of infinitely many boundary degrees of freedom , mathematically represented by fields defined in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity .",
    "however , after dividing out by gauge degrees of freedom the total phase of the theory turns out to be finite dimensional .    in our treatment of the boundary , the number of degrees of freedom associated to the boundary is finite from the start .",
    "this is appropriate for the physics of a spatial boundary in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant , but should be contrasted with the situation for negative cosmological constant , where one expects infinitely many degrees of freedom to be associated to the boundary of a spacetime containing a black hole @xcite . working in the formulation of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional gravity as chern - simons theory with the universal cover @xmath2 of the poincar group as gauge group , we compactify spatial infinity to a point and model it by a puncture on the surface @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , we consider universes of topology @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a oriented surface of genus @xmath0 with @xmath1 punctures representing massive , spinning particles .",
    "the superscript @xmath6 refers to the additional puncture which represents the boundary at spatial infinity .",
    "for the first @xmath1 punctures representing particles we employ the standard treatment of punctures in chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "we introduce additional variables which lie in coadjoint orbits of the @xmath2 , equipped with their standard symplectic structure , and couple them to the gauge field via minimal coupling .",
    "each coadjoint orbit is labelled by the mass and spin of the associated particle .",
    "it is explained in @xcite why this treatment leads to to the correct incorporation of particles in the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity .",
    "an immediate consequence of the minimal coupling to the gauge field is that the curvature of the chern - simons gauge field develops a delta - function singularity at each puncture with a coefficient which lies in the coadjoint orbit associated to the puncture .    for the puncture representing spatial infinity , in the following referred to as the distinguished puncture",
    ", our treatment differs from the standard approach .",
    "we introduce variables which lie in the cotangent bundle of @xmath2 , equipped with its canonical symplectic structure , and again couple minimally to the gauge field .",
    "justifying this mathematical description of spatial infinity is one of the main tasks of this paper . in this introduction",
    "we only point out that our model leads to a curvature singularity of the chern - simons gauge field at the distinguished puncture with a lie algebra valued coefficient .",
    "however , in contrast to the ordinary punctures the lie algebra valued coefficient is not _ a priori _ restricted to a fixed adjoint orbit .",
    "thus one may think of our distinguished puncture as describing an auxiliary particle whose mass and spin are not fixed parameters but additional variables .",
    "when all the constraints are imposed , the mass and spin of this auxiliary particle turn out to be minus the total mass and spin of the universe .",
    "having introduced the distinguished puncture and justified its interpretation as a model for spatial infinity , we parametrise the phase space of the theory and determine its symplectic structure .",
    "here we rely heavily on the paper @xcite where , using the method of @xcite , the phase space structure of chern - simons theory with a distinguished puncture is analysed in detail for gauge groups of the form @xmath7 .",
    "we derive some physical consequences of our model and relate our results to other approaches .",
    "in particular , we discuss in detail the relation between our description of the phase space and the results derived in the metric formulation of gravity in @xcite . in that paper",
    ", matschull considers @xmath1 spinless particles coupled to gravity .",
    "he parametrises the phase space in terms of variables assigned to an oriented graph embedded into a spatial slice of spacetime .",
    "we show how to reproduce his result for a particular graph from our description of the phase space in the special case of vanishing genus @xmath8 and @xmath1 spinless particles .",
    "we should also comment on the relation between this paper and our investigation of the phase space of open universes in the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity in @xcite .",
    "there we considered universes of topology @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a surface of genus @xmath0 with @xmath1 punctures and a disc removed .",
    "we proposed a parametrisation of the phase space in terms of finitely many holonomy variables and computed the poisson structure on this parameter space by applying a technique developed by fock and rosly @xcite .",
    "however , the derivation of the poisson structure given in @xcite was not based on a field - theoretical treatment of boundary degrees of freedom and relied partly on symmetry arguments .",
    "it turns out that both the symplectic structure associated to the poisson structure found in @xcite and the symplectic structure we compute in this paper can be split into a piece that describes the centre of mass motion of the universe relative to an asymptotic observer and a piece which describes the relative dynamics of the contents of the universe . while the piece describing the relative dynamics",
    "is the same in both symplectic structures , the symplectic structures for the centre of mass motion differ .",
    "we describe and comment on this difference in sect .",
    "[ flower ] .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",

    "3 we review in some detail the metric of a spinning cone which surrounds massive point particles with spin in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity and describe how this geometry is captured in the chern - simons formulation .",
    "this section provides important background for sect .  4 , where we review the boundary conditions at spatial infinity , and explain how they lead to the description of spatial infinity as a distinguished puncture .",
    "having formulated our boundary condition for spatial infinity , we then show how this condition can be implemented via an action functional .",
    "in sect .",
    "5 we give a finite - dimensional parametrisation of the phase space and determine the symplectic structure in terms of this parametrisation . the mathematical results in this section mostly follow directly from our paper @xcite , but the physical interpretation , particularly in the discussion of gauge fixing , is new . in sect .  6 we relate our description of the phase to that of matschull in the special case of vanishing genus @xmath8 and @xmath1 spinless particles .",

    "we introduce a coordinate @xmath15 on @xmath16 and sometimes we use local coordinates @xmath17 on @xmath18 . differentiation with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20",

    "is written as a gauge theory with the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional poincar group or one of its covers as gauge group . more precisely ,",
    "writing @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively for the proper orthochronous lorentz and poincar group and @xmath31 , @xmath32 for their universal covers , we are going to take @xmath2 as a gauge group in the following . in order to define the semi - direct product explicitly",
    "we need to specify how @xmath33 acts on @xmath34 .",
    "we do this by identifying @xmath34 with the dual of the lie algebra @xmath35 of @xmath33 .",
    "the group @xmath2 is then of the form @xmath7 with @xmath36 acting on the dual of its lie algebra in the coadjoint action .",
    "this is the formulation we are going to adopt , allowing us to apply the results of the papers @xcite where various aspects of chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath7 are studied in detail .",
    "since the lie algebra @xmath35 is semi - simple , however , we can simplify notation by using the killing form @xmath37 on @xmath35 to identify it with its dual .",
    "explicitly , we introduce generators @xmath38 of @xmath35 normalised so that ( j_a , j_b)=_ab=(1,-1,-1 ) and satisfying the commutation relations = _ abc j^c , where we use the convention @xmath39 and raised indices with @xmath40 . to obtain a set of generators for the lie algebra @xmath41 we introduce additional generators",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , which commute with each other and transform in the adjoint representation under the generators @xmath44 @xmath43 .",
    "the complete commutation relations are then given by [ poinccomm ] [ p_a , p_b ] = 0 , = _",
    "abc j^c,=_abcp^c .",
    "the elements @xmath45 generate translations in time and space while @xmath46 generates rotations and @xmath47 and @xmath48 lorentz boosts .",
    "the generators @xmath46 and @xmath49 of spatial rotations and time translations form an abelian cartan subalgebra of @xmath50 which we denote by @xmath51 in the following . note that , because of the lorentzian signature , [ signcon ] [ j_0,p_1]=-p_2 = p_1 , so that @xmath46 generates rotations in the mathematically negative sense in the space spanned by the translation generators @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in this paper",
    "only the cartan subalgebra @xmath51 plays a role , but we should point out that there are non - conjugate cartan subalgebras in @xmath50 , and that some elements in @xmath50 can not be conjugated into any cartan subalgebra . the general situation for the lie algebras of groups of the form @xmath7 is summarised in @xcite , where we also list references .",
    "adopting the terminology used for conjugacy classes of @xmath54 , we call elements of @xmath50 which are conjugate to @xmath55 for @xmath56 , elliptic elements and the cartan subalgebras conjugate to @xmath51 elliptic cartan subalgebras . a second family of cartan subalgebras , called hyperbolic cartan subalgebras of @xmath50 , is obtained from the cartan subalgebra spanned by @xmath47 and @xmath52 by conjugation .",
    "hyperbolic and elliptic cartan subalgebras can not be conjugated into each other .",
    "finally , there are elements of the form @xmath57 , for @xmath58 , @xmath59 which are not in any cartan subalgebra @xcite .",
    "we call these elements of @xmath50 parabolic .    for the definition of the chern - simons action we require a non - degenerate , invariant bilinear form on the lie algebra . for the lie algebra @xmath50 we have the pairing [ inprod ] j_a , p^b= _ a^b , j_a , j_b= p^a , p^b= 0 .",
    "note that this pairing is canonically defined on the lie algebra of any lie group of the form @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth stressing that the earlier identification of @xmath35 with @xmath60 via @xmath37 is only used to formulate the theory in a more familiar form ; the chern - simons formulation of gravity requires the bilinear form @xmath61 , but not the killing form @xmath37 .    with our conventions and the parametrisation (",

    "the @xmath62 action on @xmath64 is the familiar representation of an @xmath33 element as an @xmath54 matrix . in this paper",
    "we will often need to refer to the abelian subgroup of @xmath2 generated by the cartan subalgebra @xmath51 ; we will denote it by @xmath65 .",
    "its elements are rotations and time translations and can be parametrised as @xmath66 with @xmath67 , where the minus sign is inserted to take into account the remark after .",
    "einstein s theory of gravity is a field theory for a metric @xmath0 on the spacetime manifold @xmath68 .",
    "the starting point for the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity is cartan s point of view , where the theory is formulated in terms of the ( non - degenerate ) dreibein of one - forms @xmath69 , @xmath43 , and the spin connection one - forms @xmath70 , @xmath43 .",
    "the dreibein is related to the metric via [ metdreib ] ^ab",

    "variation of the chern - simons action with respect to the gauge field @xmath75 yields the condition [ flat ] f=0 .",
    "thus , in the absence of matter both the spin connection @xmath76 and the torsion @xmath77 vanish . in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "the vanishing of the spin connection is equivalent to the vanishing of the einstein tensor .",
    "equation is therefore equivalent to the einstein equations .",
    "however , due to the different role of degenerate dreibeins , the precise relationship between einstein s theory and the chern - simons formulation is problematic . in the cartan formulation of einstein s",
    "theory in 2 + 1 dimensions , the dreibein @xmath69 is required to define a metric and therefore has to be non - degenerate .",
    "the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity uses the @xmath2-connection @xmath75 on @xmath68 as the basic field and does not impose the non - degeneracy of the dreibein .",
    "it is argued in @xcite , see also @xcite for an earlier work in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional context , that this leads to global differences in the structure of the phase spaces of the two theories .",
    "the results in this paper are based on the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity , although we will discuss the link with the metric formulations extensively in sect .",
    "[ metric ] .",
    "in order to motivate the coupling of particles to the chern - simons gauge field @xmath75 we need to discuss the metric which solves the einstein equations for the energy momentum tensor for a single massive particle with spin .",
    "we do this in some detail here since this discussion will provide important background for the formulation of boundary conditions in our treatment of open universes in the next section .",
    "the metric which solves einstein s equations in the presence of a single point particle of mass @xmath78 and spin @xmath79 was derived by deser , jackiw and thooft @xcite .",

    "the metric is flat everywhere except on the @xmath15 axis .",
    "the quickest way to understand the geometry defined by this metric is to introduce `` flat coordinates '' @xmath88 via [ flatcoords ] = ( 1- ) , t = t+ , r= , in terms of which the line element takes the form of the minkowski metric [ flatline ] ds^2=dt^2-dr^2-r^2d^2 .",
    "however , the identification @xmath89 implies that one has to identify [ identification ] ~+(2-),t~t+s .",

    "equivalently , the spinning cone can be thought of as a quotient of the universal cover of @xmath106 by the equivalence relation .",

    "we now apply this method to our extended phase space with the two - form .",

    "it is easy to see that the is invariant under simultaneous right - multiplication of @xmath110 and @xmath137 by an element of the abelian subgroup @xmath291 , while all other variables stay fixed . on the extended phase space ,",
    "such a transformation manifests itself in simultaneous right - multiplication of @xmath110 or , equivalently , @xmath272 and conjugation of all holonomy variables @xmath292 this transformation preserves the constraint and the spin constraints for the particles . as explained in sect .",
    "[ physmot ] , the right multiplication of @xmath272 with @xmath66 corresponds to the rotation around and time translations in the direction of the asymptotic cone s symmetry axis .",
    "as anticipated also in sect .",
    "[ physmot ] such transformations have no physical meaning if we simultaneously rotate and time - translate all other coordinates used in the description of the universe .",
    "this is expressed mathematically in the gauge invariance of our symplectic structure under .    in order to prove that is a gauge transformation we first determine the transformation behaviour of the two - form .",
    "noting that @xmath293 is equivalent to @xmath294 we find that under the transformation @xmath295 furthermore , it follows from lemma 6.2 in @xcite , but can also verified by direct calculation from definitions and , that under the one - form transforms according to @xmath296 the sum @xmath297 therefore changes by the exact one - form @xmath298 and the transformation is a gauge transformation .",
    "another set of gauge transformations is generated by the spin constraints for the particles which reflect the redundancy in the parametrisation of @xmath299 in terms of @xmath300 .",
    "the elements @xmath301 are invariant under right - multiplication of the corresponding elements @xmath300 by a rotation of angle @xmath302 [ spingt ] v_m_iv_m_ie^-_i j_0_i . from formula , we find that this transformation changes the one - form @xmath259 according to [ partrotgt ] ( v_m_i,_m_i , u_a_j,_a_j , u_b_j,_b_j ) ( v_m_i,_m_i , u_a_j,_a_j , u_b_j,_b_j)+_i=1^n s_i_i . on the constraint surface , where the spins @xmath140 of the particles are all fixed , the last term in is a total derivative , and we see that the transformations are indeed gauge transformations .    the extended phase space is therefore given by @xmath303 parameters associated to the holonomy variables in the one - form @xmath259 , @xmath304 parameters in the poincar element @xmath221 together with the mass @xmath78 and spin @xmath79 of the universe .",
    "these parameters are subject to six constraints from the condition and @xmath1 spin constraints for the particles .",
    "furthermore , there are the two gauge transformations as well as @xmath1 gauge transformations of the form .",
    "the physical phase space is obtained by imposing the constraints and dividing by the gauge transformations .",
    "it therefore has dimension [ dofcount ] 6(n+2g)+6 + 2-(6+n)-(2+n)=4n+12 g .",
    "in particular , for the case @xmath8 , i.  e.  a system of @xmath1 particles on a disc , the dimension of the phase space is @xmath305 , the same as for a system of @xmath1 free particles without gravitational interaction .",
    "in contrast to the gauge symmetries , physical symmetries are given by group actions @xmath289 on the constraint surface @xmath306 , which depend only on a _",
    ", not a function @xmath285 , which leave the two - form @xmath228 invariant and which commute with the gauge symmetries .",

    "( for a detailed discussion of the general relation between symmetries on an extended phase space , gauge symmetries and physical symmetries see @xcite . ) in the case at hand , the physical symmetries are a global action on the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional poincar group associated to spatial infinity . on the extended phase space ,",
    "this poincar group action is given by @xmath307 or , equivalently , @xmath308 .",
    "as the gauge symmetry acts on @xmath272 and @xmath110 by right - multiplication and the gauge symmetry leaves these variables invariant , we see that the transformation indeed commutes with all gauge symmetries .",

    ", we will now discuss how to eliminate the gauge freedom in our description by imposing appropriate gauge fixing conditions .",
    "we start by considering the gauge transformations associated to the spin constraints for the particles .",

    "we now turn to the gauge transformations associated to the constraint which relates the holonomy variables to mass @xmath78 and spin @xmath79 of the asymptotic cone . as discussed in sects .",
    "[ physmot ] and [ gaugetrafo ] , these gauge transformations reflect the fact that the centre of mass condition requiring the axis of the asymptotic cone to coincide with the @xmath77-axis only determines a coordinate frame up to rotations and time translations .",
    "rotating and time translating both , the holonomy variables describing the relative motion of different particles and handles with respect to an observer and the poincar element relating the coordinate frame of the observer to a fixed frame where the axis of the cone coincides with the @xmath77-axis as in yields an equivalent description of the same physical state . in physical terms , the situation can be described as follows .",
    "the observables associated to spatial infinity allow an observer to specify a distinguished reference frame .",
    "once such a frame is specified , motions _ with respect to this frame _ are physical . however ,",
    "applying the same transformation to _ both _ the distinguished frame _ and _ all other observable objects in the universe does not yield a different state of the universe but a description of the same state in terms of a different coordinate system .",
    "it is useful to again consider the corresponding situation in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "there , one would impose as a boundary condition that the metric is asymptotically the minkowski metric , and a distinguished frame associated to spatial infinity would usually be defined by referring to a set of very distant fixed stars . the physical information about a system of particles in such a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional universe",
    "would then be given by its motion relative to these fixed stars .",
    "however , applying the same poincar transformation to the distinguished frame _ and _ the motion of the particles would not yield a different state but only a gauge equivalent description of the same state in terms of a different coordinate system .",
    "the situation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions is analogous , only that instead of the poincar symmetries associated to minkowski space , such gauge transformations take values in the symmetry group of the asymptotic cone , the abelian subgroup @xmath291 .    from the discussion above ,",
    "it is clear that there are two possible ways of gauge fixing .",
    "the first is to fix a distinguished reference frame defined by the boundary , i.  e. to impose a restriction on the poincar element @xmath270 [ timerotfix ] ( v,)=(e^-_j_0 e^-_j_2 e^_j_0 , x^1 p_1+x^2p_2),_[0,2),_^+_0 . a corresponding condition for the centre of mass case would be to set the variables @xmath215 and @xmath216 in to zero .",
    "however , the gauge fixing condition has the disadvantage that is not compatible with the asymptotic poincar symmetry and yields to complicated expressions for the centre of mass motion .    an alternative gauge fixing condition without these problems",
    "is obtained by defining a reference frame in terms of the motion of one of the particles .",
    "for instance , assuming that not all particles are at rest relative to the centre of mass of the universe , we can impose without loss of generality that the first particle moves along the @xmath27-axis , which amounts to setting @xmath319 in [ lortrfix ] v_m_1=e^-_m_1j_2_m_1^+_0 , and demand that its angular momentum three - vector is given by [ jtrfix ] _ m_1=(e^-_m_1j_2)s_1 p_0 + j_m_1 ^ 2 p_2 , which amounts to a restriction on the particle s position vector @xmath320 .",
    "although in principle it is possible to use the gauge fixing , and to express the two - form @xmath228 in terms of independent parameters , there is no obvious way of doing this in practice for a general genus @xmath0 surface with arbitrarily many massive , spinning particles . for the case of a genus @xmath8 surface with @xmath321 massive , but spinless particles",

    "it may also be of interest to consider several boundary components , which could be modelled in our formalism by including several distinguished punctures .",
    "furthermore , we expect our results to be useful in linking different approaches to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity , and to provide a unifying viewpoint for existing and future investigations of the phase space structure .",
    "this includes studies of closed universes , which can be thought as the special case @xmath405 of the open universes considered here ( though the discussion of gauge invariance and gauge fixing in sect .",
    "5 needs to be adapted ) . in this paper",
    "we explained the link between matschull s and our description of the phase space for @xmath1 spinless particles on a disc .",
    "it would also be interesting to clarify the relation between t hooft s polygon approach @xcite and the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity .",
    "this should be possible on the basis of our paper since t hooft s approach is closely related to matschull s description of the phase space in @xcite . in particular , one should be able to establish an explicit link between our description of the phase space and the coordinates and symplectic structure given in the recent papers @xcite and @xcite , which treat the case where @xmath3 is a closed surface of arbitrary genus without punctures using the polygon approach .",
    "finally , we expect the current paper to be useful in investigating the classical dynamics and the quantisation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity .",
    "the literature on these topics is vast and we shall make not attempt to survey it here , referring the reader instead to @xcite for references . rigorous and explicit results exist for special cases such as @xmath1 particle dynamics on a genus @xmath8 surface or closed universes of the form @xmath406 , where @xmath407 is the two - torus",
    ". there are unifying themes , such as the appearance of the braid group in the analysis of @xmath1 particle dynamics , but a unified and systematic treatment is still lacking .",
    "the current paper provides the starting point for such a treatment since our description of the phase space structure is general , explicit and based on variables which are amenable to a physical interpretation .",
    "bjs acknowledges support through an epsrc advanced fellowship during the early stages of this project and thanks thomas strobl for discussions about boundary conditions in field theory and gravity .",
    "in this appendix , we summarise the description of phase space and symplectic structure given by matschull @xcite for open universes of genus @xmath8 with @xmath1 massive , but spinless particles .",
    "we adapt the notation and conventions in @xcite to the conventions in the main text .",
    "an important difference in conventions is the different sign convention used for the minkowski metric in @xcite ( `` mostly plus '' instead of our `` mostly minus '' ) .",
    "hence our pairing @xmath408 is minus the trace used in @xcite .",
    "also , there is an overall relative sign in the definition of the symplectic structure .",
    "finally , we use the group @xmath2 instead of the group @xmath409 used in @xcite .    in @xcite , spatial infinity",
    "is incorporated as a connected boundary with an associated boundary condition on dreibein and spin connection .",
    "this boundary condition is the requirement that the dreibein and spin connection take the form associated to a cone with deficit angle @xmath78 and spin @xmath79 in a region around the boundary .",
    "the formalism relies on an adm - decomposition of the spacetime and an oriented graph @xmath210 embedded into a spatial slice .",
    "the embedding is such that every vertex of the graph coincides with one of the particles and each oriented edge either connects two particles or is a spatial half line extending from one particle to the boundary , see fig .",
    "[ mgraph3 ] .",
    "the oriented edges can therefore be grouped into two disjoint sets , the set @xmath410 of oriented _ internal _ edges that start and end at two vertices of the graph and the set @xmath411 of _ external _ edges that start at a vertex and extend to the boundary . for both sets of edges , there are corresponding sets @xmath412 and @xmath413 which are obtained by reversing the orientation of each edge in @xmath410 and @xmath411 , respectively . among the faces of the graph ,",
    "one distinguishes _ internal polygons _ , faces for which all sides are edges connecting particles and _ external polygons _ , faces for which at least one side is a component of the boundary .",
    "the symplectic structure is described in terms of a symplectic potential defined on an extended phase space of link variables assigned to the oriented graph as follows . to each oriented internal edge @xmath414 ,",
    "one associates an element @xmath415 [ edgeassoc ] _",
