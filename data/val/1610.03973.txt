    "[ fig:3 ] shows the band spectra of out - of - plane and in - plane polarized modes with four different types of ribbon boundaries .",
    "the ribbon band structures have some generic properties for both out - of - plane and in - plane cases . to be more specific , most of the blue lines lie in the projected bulk band area ( gray region ) with some additional bands outside the projected band which attribute to edge states .",
    "the blue lines tend to fill up the whole gray region as the widths of the ribbons increase towards infinity .",
    "as the boundaries at two sides of a ribbon are kept to be the same , the edge bands always appear in pairs . in each pair , there are two nearly overlapped bands that are excited on different sides of the ribbon . in addition",
    ", there exists flat edge dispersion connecting the projected dirac points at the mid frequency @xmath133 . for the out - of - plane case ,",
    "each spectrum of the four types is similar to the corresponding graphene ribbon .",
    "zigzag ribbons possess a pair of edge bands in the interval @xmath149 of the first brillouin zone , whereas bearded zigzag ribbons possess a pair of edge bands in the complementary region .",
    "armchair ribbons do not show edge states , but bearded armchair ribbons possess edge states over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "however , band structures of in - plane polarized modes reveal many remarkable differences from the out - of - plane case .",
    "firstly , there exist not only flat edge states at @xmath133 , but also two pairs of almost overlap bent edge bands in the gaps between bands @xmath150 and between bands @xmath151 for both zigzag and bearded zigzag ribbons .",
    "besides , both the numbers and the locations in reciprocal space of flat edge states are different from those of the out - of - plane case with the same type of edge . for zigzag ribbons , a pair of edge bands appears within the complementary region , i.e. the interval @xmath152 $ ] of the brillouin zone , in comparison with the out - of - plane case . for bearded zigzag ribbons ,",
    "there exists not only a pair of flat edge bands in the interval @xmath152 $ ] but also two pairs in complementary region @xmath153 . for bearded armchair ribbons ,",
    "two pairs of flat edge bands pass through the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the distributions of the flat edge states in all of these cases are summarized in table i.    l|cc|cc & & + &    ' '' ''    pairs & interval & pairs & interval + * zigzag & * 1 & * @xmath154 & * 1 & * @xmath155 $ ] + & & & & + * & * 1 & * @xmath155 $ ]    ' '' ''    & 1 & @xmath155 $ ] + &    ' '' ''    & & 2 & @xmath154 + * armchair & * 0 & & * 0 & + & & & & + * & * 1 & * @xmath156 & * 2 & * @xmath156 + & & & & +    [ table1 ]    by checking the eigenvectors , the additional flat bands in the whole brillouin zone for bearded zigzag and bearded armchair arise from the localized resonances at the beards . another notable effect is that both the out - of - plane and in - plane modes of armchair ribbons are metallic , namely the gap at @xmath133 is strictly closed at the dirac points , only when ribbon width @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) , and this is same to the electronic graphene system .    when long range couplings are taken into consideration , the chiral symmetry is broken , consequently , both bulk and edge bands are distorted , as illustrated by the band structures ( white curves ) of qsa hamiltonian including all long range hopping in fig",
    ".  [ fig:4 ] . nevertheless , the topology of the bands does not change , namely , the projected bulk bands are still degenerate at dirac points which are connected by edge bands in corresponding regions .",
    "also , we have broken the inversion symmetry by altering the particle size ratio of two sublattices for these four ribbons , then the gapless surface states split off naturally ( see details in appendix b ) .    moreover , since the retardation effect usually influences the band dispersions significantly in plasmonic lattices @xcite , we have also studies this influence by calculating the band structures with the intact dipole radiation given in eq .",
    "the band dispersions with the influence of retardation can be characterized by the loci of the extinction cross section peaks which can be mapped out through the effective polarizability under an external driven field ( see appendix c for detailed derivations ) @xcite .",
    "out - of - plane ( o ) and in - plane ( i ) polarized band structures ( white curves ) of ribbons including all hoppings under qsa , and the color contours of the extinction cross section where the bright stripes correspond to the band dispersions with retardation and dissipation taken into account .",
    "these @xmath146 subfigures correspond to @xmath95 different boundaries , i.e. ( a)(e ) zigzag ribbon , ( b)(f ) bearded zigzag ribbon , ( c)(g ) armchair ribbon , ( d)(h ) bearded armchair ribbon .",
    "the white dashed line is the light line in vacuum , the mid - gap edge bands are highlighted in red , and the ribbon width is chosen to be @xmath159 for all of these eight cases . ]    on the other hand , the dissipation of nanoparticles also affects the dynamic dispersion and the q factors of the resonant peaks . here , we choose the drude damping term with a small value 0.01 ev to obtain a rather clear band dispersion and also relative high q factors . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the band structures are in good agreement with qsa results especially far away from the light cone ( here only half of the brillouin zone is shown due to the symmetry , and the truncation number of hopping is chosen to be 200 ) .",
    "the lower out - of - plane bulk band and the two upper in - plane bulk bands are affected little by retardation .",
    "however , the upper out - of - plane bulk band and the two lower in - plane bulk bands are dragged down as closing to the light cone and significantly blurred due to coupling with free photons .",
    "these observations are also revealed by the multiple scattering based calculations @xcite .",
    "for the mid - gap edge bands corresponding to the flat edge bands in the nearest neighbor quasi - static approximation , outside the light cone , they are also satisfactorily consistent with the qsa results plotted by the red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . even inside the light cone , these edge bands are also agree with the results of qsa on the whole , apart from two exceptions . for the in - plane modes in bearded zigzag and bearded armchair ribbons ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4](f ) and ( h ) ) , a pair of edge bands is dragged down and submerged by the bulk bands in each case , while , in the bearded armchair case , another pair of edge bands is scarcely disturbed by retardation and still overlaps with the qsa bands inside the light cone .",
    "it has to be noted that the light cone will move to the right and occupy larger space in the brillouin zone , when the lattice constant are increased relative to the wavelength .",
    "and the occupations of the light cone in the ribbon brillouin zone are different for ribbons with different boundaries due to their different lengths of periods .",
    "as lattice constant increasing , the width of these dipole bands will be compressed , as a results , the narrowed bandwidth compels the resonant peaks to overlap with each other ( supposing the damping is unchanged ) , and eventually the band gaps as well as the edge states are submerged by this compression .",
    "therefore , a much smaller damping is needed to preserve the q factors of the bands , when increasing the lattice size .",
    "in terms of the above results , we have showed that the essential characters of the hpls band structures are accurately caught by the simplified nearest neighbor qsa method . according to the simplified qsa results , it is natural to ask why the flat edge states of in - plane polarized modes appear in different ranges than out - of - plane cases , and what determines the existence of these flat edge states . in the previous work @xcite , the existence of edge states with a particular @xmath1 in graphene ribbons for arbitrary boundaries",
    "has already been related with the zak phase of @xmath2 bands .",

    "we start from the bloch states , the eigenstates of hamiltonian for the infinite system : @xmath164 . on each site of a unit cell ,",
    "the dipole moment of this bloch state is @xmath165 which consists of a common phase factor and the relative amplitudes on two sublattices .",
