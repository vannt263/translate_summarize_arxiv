    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a background independent , non - perturbative approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore well - suited for the analysis of certain long standing questions on the quantum nature of the big bang .",
    "examples of such questions are : over the years , these and related issues had been generally relegated to the ` wish list ' of what one would like the future , satisfactory quantum gravity theory to eventually address . however , over the past five years , thanks to the seminal ideas introduced by bojowald and others , notable progress was made on such questions in the context of symmetry reduced , minisuperspaces @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found that riemannian quantum geometry , which comes on its own in the planck regime , has just the right features to resolve the big - bang singularity @xcite in a precise manner @xcite .",
    "however , the physical ramifications of this resolution in particular the answer to what is ` on the other side' have not been worked out .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether one can complete that analysis and systematically address the questions listed above , at least in the limited context of simple cosmological models .",
    "it turns out that the answer is in fact in the affirmative . a brief summary of arguments leading to this conclusion appeared in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the detailed constructions and numerical simulations that underlie those results .",
    "let us begin with a brief summary of the main results of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "( for a comprehensive survey , see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "they can be divided in two broad classes : + i ) singularity resolution based on exact quantum equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and , + ii ) phenomenological predictions based on ` effective ' equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "results in the first category make a crucial use of the effects of quantum geometry on the _ gravitational part _ of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "because of these effects , the quantum ` evolution ' is now dictated by a second order _ difference equation _ rather than the second order differential equation of the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) theory .",
    "nonetheless , the intuitive idea of regarding the scale factor @xmath0 as ` internal time ' was maintained .",
    "the difference is that the ` evolution ' now occurs in discrete steps . as explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ s2.2 ] , this discreteness descends directly from the quantum nature of geometry in lqg ; in particular , the step size is dictated by the lowest non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator .",
    "when the universe is large , the differential equation is an excellent approximation to the ` more fundamental ' difference equation .",
    "however , in the planck regime , there are major deviations .",
    "in particular , while the classical singularity generically persists in the theory without additional inputs , this is not the case in lqg .",
    "this difference does _ not _ arise simply because the discrete ` evolution ' enables one to ` jump over ' the classical singularity . indeed ,",
    "even when the discrete evolution passes _ through _ the point @xmath1 , the difference equation remains well - defined and enables one to ` evolve ' _ any _ initial data across this classically singular point .",
    "it is in this sense that the singularity was said to be resolved .    in the second category of results , by and",
    "large the focus was on quantum geometry modifications of the _ matter part _ of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the main idea is to work with approximation schemes which encode the idea of semi - classicality and to incorporate quantum geometry effects on the matter hamiltonian by adding suitable ` effective ' terms to the classical hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the hope is that dynamics generated by the ` quantum - corrected ' classical hamiltonian would have a significant domain of validity and provide a physical understanding of certain aspects of the full quantum evolution .",
    "this strategy has led to a number of interesting insights .",
    "for example , using effective equations , it was argued that the singularity resolution is generic for all homogeneous models ; that there is an early phase of inflation driven by quantum gravity effects ; that this phase leads to a reduction of power spectrum in cmb at large angular scales ; and that quantum geometry effects suppress the classical chaotic behavior of bianchi ix models near classical singularity .",
    "attractive as these results are , important limitations have persisted .",
    "let us begin with the results on singularity resolution .",
    "as in most non - trivially constrained systems , solutions to the quantum constraint fail to be normalizable in the kinematical hilbert space on which the constraint operators are well - defined .",
    "therefore one has to endow physical states ( i.e. solutions to the hamiltonian constraint ) with a new , _ physical inner product_. systematic strategies e.g .",
    ", the powerful ` group averaging procedure ' @xcite typically require that the constraint be represented by a self - adjoint operator on the kinematic hilbert space while , so far , most of the detailed discussions of singularity resolution are based on hamiltonian constraints which do not have this property .",
    "consequently , the space of solutions was not endowed with a hilbert space structure .",
    "this in turn meant that one could not introduce dirac observables nor _ physical _ semi - classical states .",
    "therefore , as pointed out , e.g. in @xcite , the physical meaning of singularity resolution remained somewhat obscure .",
    "in particular , even in simple models , there was no clear - cut answer as to what the universe did ` before ' the big - bang .",
    "was there a genuine ` quantum foam ' or was the quantum state peaked at a large classical universe on the ` other side ' ?",
    "in absence of a physical hilbert space , the second and the third questions posed in the beginning of this section could only be answered partially and the first and the fourth remained unanswered .    the phenomenological predictions have physically interesting features and serve as valuable guides for future research",
    ". however , the current form of this analysis also faces some important limitations .",
    "many of these discussions focus only on the quantum geometry modifications of the matter hamiltonian .",
    "this strategy has provided new insights and does serve as a useful starting point .",
    "however , there is no a priori reason to believe that it is consistent to ignore modifications of the gravitational part of the hamiltonian and retain only the matter modifications .",
    "conclusions drawn from such analysis can be taken as attractive suggestions , calling for more careful investigations , rather than firm predictions of lqc , to be compared with observations .",
    "on the conceptual side , a number of semi - classical approximations are made while deriving the effective equations .",
    "many of them are largely violated in the planck regime .",
    "therefore it is difficult to regard conclusions drawn from effective equations on singularity avoidance , and on the fate of the universe beyond , as reliable .",
    "it does happen surprisingly often in physics that approximation schemes turn out to work even outside the regimes for which they were originally intended .",
    "but there is no a priori reason to think that this _ must _ happen .",
    "to develop intuition on the validity of approximations , it is essential to make , in at least a few simple models , detailed comparisons of predictions of effective equations with those of quantum equations that are being approximated . to summarize ,",
    "while lqc has led to significant progress by opening new avenues and by indicating how qualitatively new and physically desirable results can arise , the program has remained incomplete even within the realm of symmetry reduced , mini - superspace models .",
    "the goal of this paper is to complete the program in the simplest of models by using a combination of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the resulting theory will enable us to answer , in the context of these models , the questions raised in the beginning of this section .",
    "specifically , we will show from first principles that : i ) a classical space - time continuum is an excellent approximation till very early times ; ii ) the singularity is resolved in the sense that a complete set of _ dirac observables _ on the _ physical _ hilbert space remains well - defined throughout the evolution ; iii ) the big - bang is replaced by a big - bounce in the _ quantum _ theory ; iv ) there is a large classical universe on the ` other side ' , and , v ) the evolution bridging the two classical branches is deterministic , thanks to the background independence and non - perturbative methods .",
    "while the paper is primarily concerned with basic conceptual and computational issues , our constructions also provide some tools for a more systematic analysis of phenomenological questions .",
    "finally , our approach can be used in more general models . in particular ,",
    "our constructions can be used also for anisotropic models and for models in which the scalar field has a potential , although certain conceptual subtleties have to be handled carefully and , more importantly , the subsequent numerical analysis is likely to be significantly more complicated .",
    "nonetheless , in a rather well defined sense , these constructions provide a foundation from which one can systematically analyze the planck regime in lqc well beyond the specific model discussed in detail .",
    "the main ideas of our analysis can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , our hamiltonian constraint is self - adjoint on the kinematical ( more precisely , auxiliary ) hilbert space .",
    "second , we use the scalar field as ` internal time ' . in the classical theory of @xmath2 models with a massless scalar field @xmath3 ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath0 as well as @xmath3 are monotonic functions of time in any given solution . in the @xmath4 case , on the other hand , since the universe recollapses , only @xmath3 has this property .",
    "therefore , it seems more natural to use @xmath3 as ` internal time ' , which does not refer to space - time coordinates or any other auxiliary structure .",
    "it turns out that @xmath3 is well - suited to be _ ` emergent time ' _ also in the quantum theory .",
    "indeed , our self - adjoint hamiltonian constraint is of the form ^2 ^ 2 = - where @xmath5 does not involve @xmath3 and is a positive , self - adjoint , difference operator on the auxiliary hilbert space of quantum geometry .",
    "hence , the quantum hamiltonian constraint can be readily regarded as a means to ` evolve ' the wave function with respect to @xmath3 . moreover",
    ", this interpretation makes the group averaging procedure similar to that used in the quantization of a ` free ' particle in a static space - time , and therefore conceptually more transparent .",
    "third , we can carry out the group averaging and arrive at the physical inner product .",
    "fourth , we identify complete sets of dirac observables on the physical hilbert space .",
    "one such observable is provided by the momentum @xmath6 conjugate to the scalar field @xmath3 and a set of them by @xmath7 , the scale factor at the ` instants of emergent time ' @xmath8 .",
    ", to construct a hamiltonian framework in the open model , one has to fix a fiducial cell .",
    "the scale factor @xmath0 ( and the momentum @xmath9 conjugate to the gravitational connection introduced later ) refers to the volume of this cell .",
    "alternatively , one can avoid the reference to the fiducial cell by fixing a @xmath8 and considering the ratios @xmath10 as dirac observables .",
    "however , for simplicity of presentation we will not follow this route . ]",
    "fifth , we construct semi - classical states which are peaked at values of these observables at late times , when the universe is large .",
    "finally we ` evolve ' them backwards using the hamiltonian constraint using the adaptive step , 4th order runge - kutta method .",
    "the numerical tools are adequate to keep track not only of how the peak of the wave function ` evolves ' but also of fluctuations in the dirac observables in the course of ` evolution ' .",
    "a variety of numerical simulations have been performed and the existence of the bounce is robust .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we summarize the framework of lqc in the homogeneous , isotropic setting , keeping the matter field generic .",
    "we first summarize the kinematical structure @xcite , highlighting the origin of the qualitative difference between the theory and lqc already at this level .",
    "we then provide a self - contained and systematic derivation of the quantum hamiltonian constraint , spelling out the underlying assumptions . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we restrict the matter field to be a massless scalar field , present the detailed theory and show that the singularity is not resolved .",
    "the choice of a massless scalar field in the detailed analysis was motivated by two considerations .",
    "first , it makes the basic constructions easier to present and the numerical simulations are substantially simpler .",
    "more importantly , in the massless case _ every _ classical solution is singular , whence the singularity resolution by lqc is perhaps the clearest illustration of the effects of quantum geometry . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we discuss this model in detail within the lqc framework , emphasizing the dynamical differences from the theory . specifically , we present the general solution to the quantum constraint , construct the physical hilbert space and introduce operators corresponding to dirac observables . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we present the results of our numerical simulations in some detail .",
    "solutions to the hamiltonian constraint are constructed using two different methods , one using a fast fourier transform and another by ` evolving ' initial data using the adaptive step , 4th order runge - kutta method .",
    "to further ensure the robustness of conclusions , the initial data ( at late ` times ' when the universe is large ) is specified in three different ways , reflecting three natural choices in the construction of semi - classical states . in all cases ,",
    "the classical big - bang is replaced by a quantum big - bounce and the two ` classical branches ' are joined by a deterministic quantum evolution .",
    "section [ s6 ] compares and contrasts the main results with those in the literature .",
    "issues which are closely related to ( but are not an integral part of ) the main results are discussed in three appendices .",
    "appendix [ a1 ] is devoted to certain heuristics on effective equations and uncertainty relations which provide a physical intuition for ` mechanisms ' underlying certain constructions and results .",
    "in appendix [ a2 ] we discuss technical aspects of numerical simulations which are important but whose inclusion in the main text would have broken the flow of the argument .",
    "finally in appendix [ a3 ] we present an alternate physical hilbert space which can be constructed by exploiting certain special features of lqc which are not found in the general setting of constrained systems .",
    "this space is more closely related to the theory and could exist also in more general contexts .",
    "its existence illustrates an alternate way to address semi - classical issues which may well be useful in full lqg .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . to make the paper self - contained , in the first we provide a brief summary of the kinematical framework , emphasizing the conceptual structure that distinguishes lqc from the theory . in the second",
    ", we introduce the self - adjoint hamiltonian constraints and their limits . by spelling out the underlying assumptions clearly",
    ", we also pave the way for the construction of a more satisfactory hamiltonian constraint in @xcite .",
    "( rather than @xmath11 ) .",
    "second , we follow the general convention in geometry and set the volume element @xmath12 on @xmath13 to be @xmath14 ( rather than @xmath15 ) .",
    "this gives rise to some differences in factors of @xmath16 in various terms in the expression of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "finally , the role of the the minimum non - zero eigenvalue of area is spelled out in detail , and the typographical error in the expression of @xmath17 that features in the hamiltonian constraint is corrected . ] in the third part , we first list issues that must be addressed to extract physics from this general program and then spell out the model considered in the rest of the paper .        in the @xmath18 case , the spatial 3-manifold @xmath13 is topologically @xmath19 , endowed with the action of the euclidean group .",
    "this action can be used to introduce on @xmath13 a fiducial , flat metric @xmath20 and an associated constant orthonormal triad @xmath21 and co - triad @xmath22 . in full general relativity ,",
    "the gravitational phase space consists of pairs @xmath23 of fields on @xmath13 , where @xmath24 is an @xmath25 connection and @xmath26 an orthonormal triad ( or moving frame ) with density weight 1 @xcite .",
    "as one would expect , in the present homogeneous , isotropic context , one can fix the gauge and spatial diffeomorphism freedom in such a way that @xmath24 has only one independent component , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 , only one independent component , @xmath28 : [ ss ] a  =   ^i _ i ,  = _ i^i , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants and the density weight of @xmath29 has been absorbed in the determinant of the fiducial metric ..",
    "thus , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the pauli matrices . ] denote by @xmath32 the subspace of the gravitational phase space @xmath33 defined by ( [ ss ] ) . because @xmath13 is non - compact and our fields are spatially homogeneous , various integrals featuring in the hamiltonian framework of the full theory diverge .",
    "however , the presence of spatial homogeneity enables us to bypass this problem in a natural fashion : fix a ` cell ' @xmath34 adapted to the fiducial triad and restrict all integrations to this cell .",
    "( for simplicity , we will assume that this cell is cubical with respect to @xmath20 . )",
    "then the gravitational symplectic structure @xmath35 on @xmath36 and fundamental poisson brackets are given by @xcite : ^s_grav = , \\",
    "{ , } = 8g3v_o where @xmath37 is the volume of @xmath34 with respect to the auxiliary metric @xmath20 . finally , there is a freedom to rescale the fiducial metric @xmath20 by a constant and the canonical variables @xmath38 fail to be invariant under this rescaling .",
    "but one can exploit the availability of the elementary cell @xmath34 to eliminate this additional ` gauge ' freedom . for , c = v_o^13",
    "p = v_o^23 are independent of the choice of the fiducial metric @xmath20 . using @xmath39 , the symplectic structure and the fundamental poisson bracket can be expressed as [ qcsym ] ^s_grav = c p \\{c , p } = 8g3 . since these expressions are now independent of the volume @xmath37 of the cell @xmath40 and make no reference to the fiducial metric @xmath20 , it is natural to regard the pair @xmath41 _ as the basic canonical variables _ on @xmath32 . in terms of @xmath9 ,",
    "the physical triad and co - triad are given by : [ e1 ] e^a_i = ( sgnp ) |p|^-",
    "( v_o^ ^a_i ) , _ a^i = ( sgn p ) |p|^ ( v_o^- _ a^i )",
    "the function @xmath42 arises because in connection - dynamics the phase space contains triads with both orientations , and since we have fixed a fiducial triad @xmath21 , the orientation of the physical triad @xmath43 is captured in the sign of @xmath44 .",
    "( as in the full theory , we also allow degenerate co - triads which now correspond to @xmath45 , for which the triad vanishes . )    finally , note that although we have introduced an elementary cell @xmath34 and restricted all integrals to this cell , the spatial topology is still @xmath19 and not @xmath46 . had the topology been toroidal , connections with non - trivial holonomy around the three circles would have enlarged the configuration space and the phase space would then have inherited additional components .      to construct quantum kinematics , one has to select a set of elementary observables which are to have unambiguous operator analogs . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "they are taken to be @xmath47 .",
    "one might first imagine using @xmath48 in their place .",
    "this would be analogous to the procedure adopted in the theory .",
    "however , unlike in geometrodynamics , lqg now provides a well - defined kinematical framework for full general relativity , without any symmetry reduction .",
    "therefore , in the passage to the quantum theory , we do not wish to treat the reduced theory as a system in its own right but follow the procedure used in the full theory .",
    "there , the elementary variables are : i ) holonomies @xmath49 defined by the connection @xmath24 along edges @xmath12 , and , ii ) the fluxes of triads @xmath26 across 2-surfaces @xmath50 . in the present case",
    ", this naturally suggests that we use : i ) the holonomies @xmath51 along straight edges @xmath52 defined by the connection @xmath53{v_o})\\ , \\w^i\\tau_i$ ] , and ii ) the momentum @xmath9 itself @xcite .",
    "now , the holonomy along the @xmath54th edge is given by : h^()_k = c2 + 2 c2 _ k [ hol]where @xmath55 is the identity 2x2 matrix .",
    "therefore , the elementary configuration variables can be taken to be @xmath56 of @xmath57 .",
    "these are called _ almost periodic _ functions of @xmath57 because @xmath58 is an arbitrary real number ( positive if the edge is oriented along the fiducial triad vector @xmath21 , and negative if it is oriented in the opposite direction ) .",
    "the theory of these functions was first analyzed by the mathematician harold bohr ( who was niels brother ) .",
    "thus , in lqc one takes @xmath59 and @xmath9 as the elementary classical variables which are to have unambiguous operator analogs .",
    "they are closed under the poisson bracket on @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , as in quantum mechanics , one can construct an abstract @xmath60-algebra @xmath61 generated by @xmath62 and @xmath9 , subject to the canonical commutation relations . the main task in quantum kinematics",
    "is to find the appropriate representation of @xmath61 .    in this task ,",
    "one again follows the full theory .",
    "there , surprisingly powerful theorems are now available : by appealing to the background independence of the theory , one can select an irreducible representation of the holonomy - flux algebra _ uniquely _ @xcite .",
    "the unique representation was constructed already in the mid - nineties and is therefore well understood @xcite . in this representation , there are well defined operators corresponding to the triad fluxes and holonomies , but the connection itself does not lead to a well - defined operator . since one follows the full theory in lqc ,",
    "the resulting representation of @xmath61 also has well - defined operators corresponding to @xmath9 and almost periodic functions of @xmath57 ( and hence , holonomies ) , but there is no operator corresponding to @xmath57 itself .",
    "the hilbert space underlying this representation is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the bohr compactification of the real line and @xmath65 is the haar measure on it",
    ". it can be characterized as the cauchy completion of the space of continuous functions @xmath66 on the real line with finite norm , defined by : ||f||^2 = _ d 12d _",
    "-d^d |f f dc . an orthonormal basis in @xmath67",
    "is given by the almost periodic functions of the connection , @xmath68 .",
    "( the @xmath69 are the lqc analogs of the spin network functions in full lqg @xcite ) .",
    "they satisfy the relation n_()|n_(^ ) e^ic2|e^i^c2 = _ , ^ .",
    "note that , although the basis is of the plane wave type , the right side has a kronecker delta , rather than the dirac distribution . therefore a generic element @xmath70 of @xmath67 can be expanded as a _ countable sum _",
    "@xmath71 where the complex coefficients @xmath72 are subject to latexmath:[$\\sum_k    @xmath67 and the more familiar hilbert space @xmath74 of quantum mechanics ( or of the theory ) consists only of the zero function .",
    "thus , already at the kinematic level , the lqc hilbert space is _ very _ different from that used in the theory .    the action of the fundamental operators , however , is the familiar one .",
    "the configuration operator acts by multiplication and the momentum by differentiation : _",
    "( ) ( c)= ic2 ( c ) , ( c ) = -i 8 ^ 23 c where , as usual , @xmath75 .",
    "the first of these provides a 1-parameter family of unitary operators on @xmath67 while the second is self - adjoint .",
    "it is often convenient to use the dirac bra - ket notation and set @xmath76 . in this notation ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath77 are simply the basis vectors @xmath78 : | = 8 ^ 26 | .",
    "finally , since the operator @xmath79 representing the volume of the elementary cell @xmath34 is given by latexmath:[$\\hat{v } =    @xmath79 : | = ( 86 ||)^32 ^3 | .",
    "the algebra @xmath61 , of course , also admits the familiar representation on @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , as we will see in section [ s3 ] , this is precisely the ` schrdinger representation ' underlying the theory .",
    "the lqc representation outlined above is unitarily inequivalent .",
    "this may seem surprising at first in the light of the von - neumann uniqueness theorem of quantum mechanics .",
    "the lqg representation evades that theorem because there is no operator @xmath81 corresponding to the connection component @xmath57 itself .",
    "put differently , the theorem requires that the unitary operators @xmath82 be _ weakly continuous _ in @xmath58 , while our operators on @xmath67 are not .",

    ".    we will conclude our summary of the quantization strategy by comparing this construction with that used in full lqg @xcite . as one would expect , the curvature operator there is completely analogous to ( [ f ] ) .",
    "however in the subsequent discussion of the hamiltonian constraint certain differences arise : while the full theory is diffeomorphism invariant , the symmetry reduced theory is not because of gauge fixing carried out in the beginning of section [ s2.1.1 ] .",
    "( these differences are discussed in detail in sections 4 and 5 of @xcite . ) as a result , in the dynamics of the reduced theory , we have to ` parachute ' the area gap @xmath98 from the full theory . from physical considerations ,",
    "this new input seems natural and the strategy is clearly viable since that the constraint operator has the correct classical limit .",
    "however , so far there is no systematic procedure which leads us to the dynamics of the symmetry reduced theory from that of the full theory .",
    "this is not surprising because the hamiltonian constraint in the full theory has many ambiguities and there is nt a canonical candidate that stands out as being the most satisfactory .",
    "the viewpoint in lqc is rather that , at this stage , it would be more fruitful to study properties of lqc constraints such as the one introduced in this section and in @xcite , and use the most successful of them as a guide to narrow down the choices in the full theory .",
    "it is easy to verify that , although the classical constraint function @xmath95 we began with is real on the phase space @xmath32 , the operator @xmath104 is not self - adjoint on @xmath67 .",
    "this came about just because of the standard factor ordering ambiguities of quantum mechanics and there are two natural re - orderings that can rectify this situation .",

    "grav^ ( ) = f^_+ ( + 4_o ) + f^_o ( ) + f^_- ( - 4_o)where the coefficients @xmath106 are functions of @xmath58 : f^_o ( ) & = & - | |+_o|^-|-_o|^ | + f^_+ ( ) & = & - ( f^_o()+f^_o(+4_o ) ) + f^_- ( ) & = & - ( f^_o()+f^_o(-4_o ) ) by construction , this operator is self - adjoint and one can show that it is also bounded above ( in particular , @xmath107 ) .",
    "next , consider the _",
    "` parity ' _ operator @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 .",
    "it corresponds to the flip of the orientation of the triad and thus represents a large gauge transformation",
    ". it will play an important role in section [ s4 ] . here",
    "we note that the functions @xmath110 are such that the constraint operator @xmath111 commutes with @xmath108 : = 0 finally , for @xmath112 , this difference operator can be approximated , in a well - defined sense , by a second order differential operator ( a connection - dynamics analog of the operator of geometrodynamics ) . since @xmath113 is just the self - adjoint part of the operator used in @xcite , we can directly use results of section 4.2 of that paper . set @xmath114 and consider functions @xmath115 which , together with their first four derivatives are bounded . on these functions , we have [ wdw1 ] _ grav^ ( p ) 64 ^ 23 ^4 [ + ^2p^2 ] ( p ) = : _ grav^wdw ( p)where @xmath116 stands for equality modulo terms of the order @xmath117 .",
    "that is , had we left @xmath17 as a free parameter , the equality would hold in the limit @xmath97 .",
    "this is the limit in which the area gap goes to zero , i.e. , quantum geometry effects can be neglected .",
    "let us now turn to the second natural factor ordering .",
    "the form of the expression ( [ qh1 ] ) of @xmath118 suggests @xcite that we simply ` re - distribute ' the @xmath119 term in a symmetric fashion .",

    "its action on states @xmath123 is given by [ qh6 ] _ grav ( ) = f_+ ( + 4_o ) + f_o ( ) + f_- ( - 4_o)where the coefficients @xmath124 are again functions of @xmath58 : f_+ ( ) & = & 12 ( _ o^2)^32 |    f_- ( ) & = & f_+(-4_o ) + f_o ( ) & = & -f_+ ( ) - f_- ( ) .",
    "it is clear from eqs ( [ qh5 ] ) and ( [ a ] ) that @xmath125 commutes with the parity operator @xmath108 which flips the orientations of triads : = 0 .finally , the ` continuum limit ' of the difference operator @xmath121 yields a second order differential operator .",
    "let us first set ( ) = f_+(- 2_o ) [ ( + 2_o ) - ( -2_o ) ] then , _ grav ( ) = ( + 2_o ) - ( -2_o ) therefore , if we again set @xmath114 and consider functions @xmath115 which , together with their first four derivatives are bounded we have [ wdw2 ] _ grav ( p ) 128 ^ 23 ^4 [ p p ] = : _ grav^wdw ( p)where @xmath116 again stands for equality modulo terms of the order @xmath117 .",

    "since our primary motivation behind the introduction of the theory is to compare it with lqc , it is most convenient to use the factor ordering that comes from the continuum limit ( [ wdw2 ] ) of the constraint operator of lqc . then , the equation becomes : [ wdw3 ] 23 ( 8g)^2 pp = 8g^2 ^2 ^ 2 = : 8 g ^2 ( p ) ^2 ^ 2 , where we have denoted the eigenvalue @xmath163 of @xmath164 by @xmath165 to facilitate later comparison with lqc .",

    "our first task is to endow the space of these physical states with a hilbert space structure .",
    "there are several possible avenues .",
    "we will begin with one that is somewhat heuristic but has direct physical motivation .",
    "the idea @xcite is to introduce operators corresponding to a complete set of dirac observables and select the required inner product by demanding that they be self - adjoint . in the classical theory ,",

    "now , we see that both these operators have the further property that they preserve the positive and negative frequency subspaces . since they constitute a complete family of dirac observables , we have _ superselection_. in quantum theory we can restrict ourselves to one superselected sector . in what follows , for definiteness",
    "_ we will focus on the positive frequency sector and , from now on , drop the suffix @xmath200_.    we now seek an inner product on positive frequency solutions @xmath196 to ( [ wdw4 ] ) ( invariant under the @xmath58 reflection ) which makes @xmath201 and @xmath202 self - adjoint .",
    "each of these solutions is completely determined by its initial datum @xmath203 and the dirac observables have the following action on the datum : ( , _ o ) = || ( , _ o ) , _ ( , _ o ) = ( , _ o ) .",
    "therefore , it follows that ( modulo an overall rescaling , ) the unique inner product which will make these operators self - adjoint is just : [ ip1 ] _",
    "1|_2_phy = _ = _ o d ( ) |_1 _ 2 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "it is easy to evaluate the integral in the approximation @xmath225 ( which is justified because @xmath226 ) and calculate mean values of the dirac observables and their fluctuations .",
    "one finds that , as required , the state is sharply peaked at values @xmath227 .",
    "the above construction is closely related to that of coherent states in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "we can now ask for the evolution of this state .",
    "does it remain peaked at the classical trajectory defined by @xmath228 passing through @xmath229 at @xmath230 ?",
    "this question is easy to answer because ( [ sol2 ] ) implies that the ( positive frequency ) solution @xmath196 to ( [ wdw4 ] ) defined by ` initial data ' ( [ sc ] ) is obtained simply by replacing @xmath8 by @xmath3 in ( [ sc ] ) !",

    "this is just as one would hope during the epoch in which the universe is large .",

    "this is a conservative approach in that the results will directly reveal the manifestations of quantum geometry ; had we chosen a non - standard representation for the scalar field , these effects would have been mixed with those arising from an unusual representation of ` time evolution ' .",

    "the form of ( [ qh7 ] ) is the same as that of the constraint ( [ wdw4 ] ) , the only difference is that the @xmath3-independent operator @xmath250 is now a difference operator rather than a differential operator .",
    "thus , the the lqc quantum hamiltonian constraint can also be regarded as an ` evolution equation ' which evolves the quantum state in the emergent time @xmath3 .",
    "however , since @xmath250 is a difference operator , an important difference arises from the analysis . for , now the space of physical states , i.e. of appropriate solutions to the constraint equation , is naturally divided into sectors each of which is preserved by the ` evolution ' and by the action of our dirac observables .",
    "thus , there is super - selection .",

    "finally we note that any symmetric element @xmath123 of @xmath257 can be expanded as [ sym ] ( ) = _ -^ dk ( k ) e^(s)_k ( )    we can now write down the general symmetric solution to the quantum constraint ( [ qh7 ] ) with initial data in @xmath257 : [ sol3 ] ( , ) = _ -^ dk [ _ + ( k ) e^(s)_k ( ) e^i + _ - ( k ) |e^(s)_k ( ) e^-i]where @xmath321 are in @xmath322 . as @xmath323 , these approach solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) to the equation .",
    "however , the approach is not uniform in the hilbert space but varies from solution to solution .",
    "as indicated in section [ s2.2 ] , the lqc solutions to ( [ qh7 ] ) which are semi - classical at late times can start departing from the solutions for relatively large values of @xmath58 , say @xmath324 .",

    "we now summarize the situation in the special cases , @xmath329 and @xmath330 . in these cases , differences arise because the individual lattices are invariant under the reflection @xmath174 , i.e. , the lattices @xmath251 and @xmath253 coincide .",
    "as before , there is a 2-fold degeneracy in the eigenvectors of @xmath250 on any one lattice . for concreteness ,",
    "let us label the hilbert spaces @xmath262 and choose the basis vectors @xmath331 , with @xmath180 as above .",

    "this is not surprising : the original degeneracy was 2-fold ( rather than 4-fold ) and so there is one symmetric and one anti - symmetric eigenvector per eigenvalue .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that there is a precise sense in which the hilbert space of symmetric states is only ` half as big ' in these exceptional cases as they are for a generic @xmath271 .    for @xmath334 , there is a further subtlety because @xmath335 vanishes at @xmath336 and @xmath337 vanishes at @xmath338 .",
    "thus , in this case , as in the theory , there is a decoupling and the knowledge of the eigenfunction @xmath339 on the positive @xmath58-axis does not suffice to determine it on the negative @xmath58 axis and vice - versa .",
    "however , the degeneracy of the eigenvectors does not increase but remains 2-fold because ( [ qh7 ] ) now introduces two new constraints : @xmath340 e^+_k(\\pm 2\\mu_o ) = 0 $ ] .",
    "conceptually , this difference is not significant ; there is again a single symmetric eigenfunction for each eigenvalue .",
    "results of section [ s4.1 ] show that while the lqc operator @xmath250 differs from the operator @xmath291 in interesting ways , the structural form of the two hamiltonian constraint equations is the same .",
    "therefore , apart from the issue of superselection sectors which arises from the fact that @xmath250 is discrete , introduction of the dirac observables and determination of the inner product either by demanding that the dirac observables be self - adjoint or by carrying out group averaging is completely analogous in the two cases .",
    "therefore , we will not repeat the discussion of section [ s3.2 ] but only summarize the final structure .",
    "the sector of physical hilbert space @xmath341 labelled by @xmath342 $ ] consists of positive frequency solutions @xmath196 to ( [ qh7 ] ) with initial data @xmath343 in the symmetric sector of @xmath344 .",
    "( [ sol3 ] ) implies that they have the explicit expression in terms of our eigenvectors @xmath345 [ eq : psi - int ] ( , ) = _ -^dk ( k ) e^(s)_k ( ) e^i , where , as before , @xmath346 and @xmath345 is given by ( [ eq : e - symm ] ) and ( [ sb ] ) . by choosing appropriate functions",
    "@xmath347 , this expression will be evaluated in section [ s5.1 ] using fast fourier transforms .",
    "the resulting @xmath196 will provide , numerically , quantum states which are semi - classical for large @xmath58 .",

    "1|_2 _ = _ \\{|| + 4n_o ; n }",
    "b ( )    observables is independent of @xmath271 , and has the same form as in the theory : [ dirac4 ] ( , ) = e^i(-_o ) || ( , _ o ) , _ ( , ) = - i ( , ) .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space @xmath136 is non - separable but , because of super - selection , each physical sector @xmath341 is separable .",
    "eigenvalues of the dirac observable @xmath197 constitute a discrete subset of the real line in each sector . in the kinematic hilbert space @xmath67 , the spectrum of @xmath77 is discrete in a subtler sense : while every real value is allowed , the spectrum has discrete topology , reflecting the fact that each eigenvector has a finite norm in @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the more delicate discreteness of the spectrum of @xmath77 on @xmath67 descends to the standard type of discreteness of dirac observables .",
    "question is often raised whether the kinematic discreteness in lqg will have strong imprints in the physical sector or if they will be washed away in the passage to the physical hilbert space . a broad answer illustrated by the area eigenvalues of isolated horizons",
    "@xcite is that the discreteness will generically descend to the physical sector at least in cases where one can construct dirac observables directly from the kinematical geometrical operators @xcite .",
    "the present discussion provides another illustration of this situation .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of @xmath197 in distinct sectors are distinct .",
    "therefore which sector actually occurs is a question that can be in principle answered experimentally , provided one has access to microscopic measurements which can distinguish between values of the scale factor which differ by @xmath348 .",
    "this will not be feasible in the foreseeable future .",
    "of greater practical interest are the coarse - grained measurements , where the coarse graining occurs at significantly greater scales . for these measurements , different sectors would be indistinguishable and one could work with any one .",
    "the group averaging procedure used in this section is quite general in the sense that it is applicable for a large class of systems , including full lqg if , e.g. , its dynamics is formulated using thiemann s master constraint program @xcite . in this sense , the physical hilbert spaces @xmath341 constructed here are natural . however , using the special structures available in this model , one can also construct an inequivalent representation which is closer to that used in the theory .",
    "the main results on the bounce also hold in that representation .",
    "although that construction appears to have an ad - hoc element , it may well admit extensions and be useful in more general models .",
    "therefore , it is presented in appendix [ a3 ] .",
    "in this section , we will find physical states of lqg and analyze their properties numerically .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in the first we study eigenfunctions @xmath349 of @xmath250 and",
    "then use them to directly evaluate the right side of ( [ eq : psi - int ] ) , thereby obtaining a ` general ' physical state . in the second part",
    "we solve the initial value problem starting from initial data at @xmath184 , thereby obtaining a ` general ' solution to the difference equation ( [ qh7 ] ) . in the third we summarize the main results and compare the outcome of the two methods .",
    "readers who are not interested in the details of simulations can go directly to the third subsection .",
    "a large number of simulations were performed within each of the approaches by varying the parameters in the initial data and working with different lattices @xmath350 .",

    "the goal of this sub - section is to evaluate the right side of ( [ eq : psi - int ] ) using suitable momentum profiles @xmath347 .",
    "this calculation requires the knowledge of eigenfunctions @xmath351 of @xmath250 .",

    "we will conclude with two remarks .",
    "a.   let us return to the comparison between the results of lqc and the theory in light of our numerical results .",
    "as remarked in section [ s2.2 ] , on functions @xmath123 which we used to construct the semi - classical initial data , the leading term in the difference @xmath550 between the actions of the two constraint operators goes as @xmath551",
    ". now , in lqc @xmath17 is fixed , ( @xmath127 ) , and on semi - classical states @xmath552 .",
    "hence the difference is negligible only in the regime @xmath553 . in our simulations , @xmath554 whence the differences are guaranteed to be negligible only for @xmath555 , i.e. , well away from the bounce . but let us probe the situation in greater detail .",
    "let us regard @xmath17 as a mathematical parameter which can be varied and shrink it . in the limit @xmath97 , @xmath556 should tend to zero .",
    "since there is no bounce in the theory , we are led to ask : would the lqc bounce continue to exist all the way to @xmath557 or is there a critical value at which the bounce stops ?",
    "the answer is that for any finite value of @xmath17 there is a bounce .",
    "however , if we keep the _",
    "physical _ initial data the same , we find that as we decrease @xmath17 the solution follows the classical trajectory into the past more and more and bounce is pushed further and further in to the past . in the limit as @xmath17 goes to zero , the wave function follows the classical trajectory into infinite past , i.e. , the bounce never occurs .",
    "this is the sense in which the result is recovered in the limit @xmath558 .",
    "b.   numerical simulations show that the matter density at the bounce points is inversely proportional to the expectation value @xmath559 of the dirac observable @xmath162 : given two semi - classical states with @xmath560 and @xmath561 , we have @xmath562 .",
    "therefore , this density can be made small by choosing sufficiently large @xmath151 .",
    "physically , this is unreasonable because one would not expect departures from the classical theory until matter density becomes comparable to the planck density .",
    "this is a serious weakness of our framework .",
    "essentially every investigations within lqc we are aware of has this or a similar drawback but it did not become manifest before because the physics of the singularity resolution had not been analyzed systematically .",
    "the origin of this weakness can be traced back to details of the construction of the hamiltonian constraint operator , specifically the precise manner in which the operator corresponding to the classical field strength @xmath89 was introduced . the physical idea that in lqc the operator corresponding to the field strength @xmath89 should be defined through holonomies , and that quantum geometry does not allow us to shrink the loop to zero size , seem compelling . however , the precise manner in which the value of @xmath17 was determined using the area gap @xmath98 is not as systematic and represents only a ` first stab ' at the problem . in @xcite",
    "we will discuss an alternate and more natural way of implementing this idea .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian constraint has a similar form but also important differences . because of similarities",
    "the qualitative conclusions of this analysis including the occurrence of the quantum bounce are retained but the differences are sufficiently important to replace the expression of the critical density by @xmath563 where , as before , @xmath564 is the area gap . since @xmath565 is of planck scale and is independent of parameters associated with the semi - classical state , such as @xmath151 , the departures from classical theory now appear only in the planck regime .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we will first present a brief summary and then compare our analysis with similar constructions and results which have appeared in the literature .",
    "however , since this literature is vast , to keep the discussion to a manageable size , these comparisons will be illustrative rather than exhaustive .    in general relativity ,",
    "gravity is encoded in space - time geometry .",
    "a basic premise of lqg is that geometry is fundamentally quantum mechanical and its quantum aspects are central to the understanding of the physics of the planck regime . in the last three sections",
    ", we saw that lqc provides a concrete realization of this paradigm . in our model",
    "every classical solution is singular and the singularity persists in the theory .",
    "the situation is quite different in lqc . as in full lqg , the kinematical framework of lqc forces us to define curvature in terms of holonomies around closed loops .",
    "the underlying quantum geometry of the full theory suggests that it is physically incorrect to shrink the loops to zero size because of the ` area gap ' @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to a replacement of the differential equation by a difference equation whose step size are dictated by @xmath98 .",
    "careful numerical simulations demonstrated in a robust fashion that the classical big - bang is now replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "thus , with hindsight , one can say that although the theory is quite similar to lqc in its structure , the singularity persists in the theory because it ignores the quantum nature of geometry .",
    "representing the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath243 in lqg is different from the corresponding @xmath406 of the theory .",
    "the second comes from the role of quantum geometry in the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint , emphasized above . in our model ,",
    "qualitatively new features of the lqg quantum dynamics can be traced back to the second . in particular , the bounce would have persisted even if we had used @xmath406 in place of @xmath405 in the analysis presented in this paper . ]    emergent time    in this paper we isolated the scalar field @xmath3 as the emergent time and used it to motivate and simplify various constructions . however , we would like to emphasize that this or indeed any other choice of emergent time is not _ essential _ to the final results . in the classical theory ( for",
    "any given value of the constant of motion @xmath142 ) , we can draw dynamical trajectories in the @xmath566 plane without singling out an internal clock .",
    "a complete set of dirac observables can be taken to be @xmath142 , and either @xmath567 _ or _",
    "what these observables measure is correlations and their specification singles out a point in the reduced phase space .",
    "however , we do not have to single out a time variable to define them .",
    "the same is true in quantum theory . to have complete control of physics",
    ", we need to construct the physical hilbert space @xmath137 and introduce on it a complete set of dirac observables . again , both these steps can be carried out without singling out @xmath3 as emergent time .",
    "for example , the scalar product can be constructed using group averaging which requires only the knowledge of the full quantum constraint and its properties , and not its decomposition into a ` time evolution part ' @xmath569 and an operator @xmath250 on the ` true degrees of freedom ' .",
    "once the scalar product is constructed , we can introduce a complete set of dirac observables consisting of @xmath162 , and @xmath197 _ or _ @xmath570 .",
    "again , what matters is the correlations .",
    "this and related issues have been discussed exhaustively in the quantum gravity literature in relativity circles . in particular ,",
    "a major part of a conference proceedings @xcite was devoted to it in the late eighties and several exhaustive reviews also appeared in the nineties ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "however , thanks to our knowledge of how quantum theory works in static space - times , singling out @xmath3 as the emergent time turned out to be extremely useful in practice because it provided guidance at several intermediate steps . in particular , it directly motivated our choice of @xmath571 as our auxiliary hilbert space ; stream - lined the detailed definition of operators representing the dirac observables ; and facilitated the subsequent selection of the inner product by demanding that these be self - adjoint .",
    "more importantly , by enabling us to regard the constraint as an evolution equation , it transformed the ` frozen formalism ' to a familiar language of ` evolution ' and enabled us to picture and interpret the bounce and associated physics more easily .",
    "indeed , following the lead of early lqc papers , initially we tried to use @xmath58 as time and ran in to several difficulties : specification of physically interesting data became non - intuitive and cumbersome ; one could not immediately recognize the occurrence of the bounce ; and the physics of the singularity resolution remained obscure .",
    "our specific identification and use of emergent time differs in some respects from that introduced earlier in the literature .",
    "for example , in the context of the theory , there is extensive work on isolating time in the wkb approximation ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , a key feature of our emergent time is that it is not restricted to semi - classical regimes : we first isolated the scalar field @xmath3 as a variable which serves as a good internal clock away from the singularity in the classical theory , but then showed that the form of the _ quantum _ hamiltonian constraint is such that @xmath3 can be regarded as emergent time in the _ full _ quantum theory , without a restriction that the states be semi - classical or stay away from the singularity .",
    "the idea of identifying an emergent time and exploiting the resulting ` deparametrization ' to select an inner product on the space of solutions to the hamiltonian constraint is not new @xcite .",
    "however , several of the concrete proposals turn out to have serious deficiencies ( for a further discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of using a matter field to define emergent time is rather old . in the framework of geometrodynamics , it was carried out in detail for dust in @xcite . a proposal to use a massless scalar field as time",
    "was also made in the framework of lqg @xcite but its implementation remained somewhat formal .",
    "in particular , it is unlikely that the required gauge conditions can be imposed globally in the phase space and the modifications in the construction of the physical scalar product that are necessary to accommodate a more local constructions were not spelled out .",
    "more recently , a massless scalar field was used as the internal clock in quantum cosmology in the connection dynamics framework @xcite .",
    "however , the focus of discussion there is on the kodama state in inflationary models . because of the inflationary potential",
    ", the quantum constraint has explicit time dependence and the construction of the physical inner product is technically much more subtle . in particular , a viable inner product can not depend on any auxiliary structure such as the choice of an ` instant of time ' .",
    "these issues do not appear to have been fully addressed in @xcite .",
    "resolutions of the big - bang singularity    the issue of obtaining singularity free cosmological models has drawn much attention over the years . the discovery of singularity theorems sharpened this discussion and there is a large body of literature on how one may violate one or more assumptions of these theorems , thereby escaping the big bang .",
    "proposals include the use of matter which violate the standard energy conditions , addition of higher derivative corrections to the einstein - hilbert action and introduction of higher dimensional scenarios inspired by string theory .",
    "to facilitate comparison with the model discussed in this paper , we will restrict ourselves to spatially non - compact situations .",
    "already in the seventies , bekenstein investigated a model where the matter source consisted of incoherent radiation and dust , interacting with a conformal massless scalar field ( which can have a negative energy density ) .",
    "he showed that einstein s equations admit solutions which are free of singularities @xcite . in the eighties , narlikar and padmanabhan found a singularity free solution to einstein s equation with radiation and a _ negative energy _",
    "massless scalar field ( called the ` creation field ' ) as source , and argued that the resulting model was consistent with the then available observations @xcite .",
    "such investigations were carried out entirely in the paradigm of classical relativity and the key difference from the standard friedmann - robertson - walker models arose from the use of ` non - standard ' matter sources .",
    "our analysis , by contrast , uses a standard massless scalar field and _ every _ solution is singular in the classical theory .",
    "the singularity is resolved because of quantum effects .",
    "another class of investigations starts with actions containing higher derivative terms which are motivated by suitable fundamental considerations .",
    "for example , to guide the search for an effective theory of gravity which is viable close to the planck scale , mukhanov and brandenberger proposed an action with higher order curvature terms for which all isotropic cosmological solutions are non - singular , even when coupled to matter @xcite .",
    "the modifications to einstein s equations are thought of as representing quantum corrections",
    ". however one continues to work with differential equations formulated in the continuum .",
    "by contrast , our investigation is carried out in the framework of a genuine quantum theory with a physical hilbert space , dirac observables and detailed calculations of expectation values and fluctuations .",
    "departures from classical general relativity arise directly from the quantum nature of geometry .",
    "the final results are also different : while solutions in @xcite asymptotically approach de sitter space , in our analysis the classical big - bang is replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "perhaps the most well - known discussions of bounces come from the pre - big - bang cosmology and ekpyrotic / cyclic models .",
    "the pre - big - bang model uses the string dilaton action and exploits the scale factor duality to postulate the existence of a super - inflating pre - big - bang branch of the universe , joined to the radiation dominated post - big - bang branch @xcite .",
    "however , the work was carried out in the framework of perturbative string theory and the transition from the pre - big - bang to post - big - branch was _",
    "postulated_. the initial hope was that non - perturbative stringy effects would enforce such a transition .",
    "however , as of now , such mechanisms have not been found @xcite .",
    "although subsequent investigations have shown that a bounce can occur in simplified models @xcite or by using certain effective equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is not yet clear that this is a consequence of the fundamental theory .",
    "the ekpyrotic and the more recent cyclic models @xcite are motivated by certain compactifications in string theory and feature a five dimensional bulk space - time with a 4-d branes as boundaries . in the ekpyrotic model , the collision between a bulk brane with a boundary brane is envisioned as a big bang . a key difficulty is the singularity associated with this collision @xcite ( which can be avoided but at the cost of violating the null energy condition @xcite ) . in the cyclic model",
    ", collision occurs between the boundary branes @xcite , however it has been shown that the singularity problems persists @xcite .",
    "thus , a common limitation of these models is that the branch on ` our side ' of the big - bang is not joined deterministically to the branch on the ` other side ' . in lqc by contrast , the quantum evolution is fully deterministic .",
    "this is possible because the approach is non - perturbative and does not require a space - time continuum in the background .",
    "finally , the idea of a bounce has been pursued also in the context of braneworld models . in the original randall - sundrum scenario , the friedmann equation _",
    "is _ modified by addition of a term on the right side which is quadratic in density : @xmath572 where @xmath231 is brane tension .",
    "however , since @xmath573 , the sign of the quadratic term in @xmath574 is positive whence @xmath575 can not vanish and there is no bounce . to obtain a bounce ,",
    "the correction should be negative , i.e. , make a ` repulsive ' contribution .",
    "one way to reverse the sign is to introduce a second time - like dimension in the bulk @xcite .",
    "however , this strategy does not appear to descend from fundamental considerations and the physical meaning of the second time - like direction is also unclear .",
    "another avenue is to consider a bulk with a charged black hole .",
    "a non - vanishing charge leads to terms in the modified friedmann equation which are negative .",
    "@xmath575 can now vanish and a bounce can occur @xcite",
    ". however it was shown that transition from contraction to expansion for the brane trajectory occurs in the cauchy horizon of the bulk which is unstable to small excitations , thus the brane encounters singularity before bouncing @xcite . in lqc , by contrast , while the friedmann equation _ is _ effectively modified , the corrections come from quantum geometry and they are automatically negative .    extensions    a major limitation of our analysis  shared by all other current investigations in quantum cosmology",
    "is that the theory is not developed by a systematic truncation of full quantum gravity . this is inevitable because we do not have a satisfactory quantum gravity theory which can serve as an unambiguous starting point .",
    "the viewpoint is rather that one should use lessons learned from mini and midi superspace analysis to work one s way up to more general situations , especially to reduce the large number of ambiguities that exist in the dynamics of the full theory .",
    "even within quantum cosmology , our detailed analysis was restricted to a specific mini - superspace model . in more complicated models ,",
    "differences are bound to arise .",
    "for example , the full solution is not likely to remain so sharply peaked on the classical trajectory till the bounce point and even the existence of a bounce is not a priori guaranteed , especially when inhomogeneities are added .",
    "however , the _ methods _ developed in the paper can be applied to more general situations .",
    "first , one could consider anisotropies .",
    "now , the main structural difference is that the operator @xmath250 will no longer be positive definite .",
    "however , a detailed analysis shows that what matters is just the operator @xmath576 , obtained by projecting the action of @xmath250 to the positive eigenspace in its spectral decomposition .",
    "therefore , our analytical considerations should go through without a major modification .",
    "the numerical simulations will be more complicated because we have to solve a higher dimensional difference equation ( involving 4 variables in place of 2 ) .",
    "another extension will involve the inclusion of non - trivial potentials for the scalar field .",
    "now , generically @xmath3 will no longer be a monotonic function on the classical trajectories and one would not be able to use it as ` internal time ' globally . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the operator @xmath250 becomes ` time - dependent ' ( i.e. depends on @xmath3 ) and the mathematical analogy between the quantum constraint and the klein - gordon equation in a static space - time is no longer valid .",
    "nonetheless , one can still use the group averaging procedure @xcite to construct the physical hilbert space . for a general potential , a useful notion of time will naturally emerge only in the semi - classical regimes . for specific potentials ( such as the quadratic one used in chaotic inflation )",
    "one should be able to use methods that have been successfully employed in the quantization of model systems @xcite ( in particular , a pair of harmonic oscillators constrained to have a fixed total energy ) .",
    "incorporation of spherical inhomogeneities seems to be within reach since significant amount of technical groundwork has already been laid @xcite .",
    "incorporation of general inhomogeneities , on the other hand , will be substantially more difficult .",
    "background dependent treatments have suggested that results obtained in the mini - superspace approximation may be qualitatively altered once field theoretical complications are unleashed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , already in the anisotropic case , there is a qualitative difference between perturbative and non - perturbative treatments .",
    "specifically , if anisotropies are treated as perturbations of a background isotropic model , the big - bang singularity is not resolved while if one treats the whole problem non - perturbatively , it is @xcite .",
    "therefore definitive conclusions can not be reached until detailed calculations have been performed in inhomogeneous models . however ,",
    "if a quantum bounce does generically replace the big bang singularity , it would be possible to explore the relation between the effective descriptions of lqg and the hartle - hawking ` no boundary ' proposal @xcite . for",
    ", in the effective description , the extrinsic curvature would vanish at the bounce .",
    "therefore generically it may be possible to attach to the lorentzian , post - bounce effective solution representing the universe at late times , a _",
    "pre - bounce solution without boundary .",
    "if so , it would be very interesting to analyze the sense in which this riemannian solution captures the physics of the pre - bounce branch of the full quantum evolution .    finally , it is instructive to recall the situation with singularities in classical general relativity .",
    "there , singularities first appeared in highly symmetric situations . for a number of years",
    ", arguments were advanced that this is an artifact of symmetry reduction and generic , non - symmetric solutions will be qualitatively different",
    ". however , singularity theorems by penrose , hawking , geroch and others showed that this is not correct .",
    "an astute use of the _ differential geometric _ raychaudhuri equation revealed that singularities first discovered in the simple , symmetric solutions are in fact a generic feature of classical general relativity .",
    "a fascinating question is whether the singularity resolution due to quantum geometry is also generic in an appropriate sense @xcite .",
    "is there a general equation in _ quantum geometry _ which implies that gravity effectively becomes repulsive near generic space - like singularities , thereby halting the classical collapse ?",
    "if so , one could construct robust arguments , now establishing general ` singularity resolution theorems ' for broad classes of situations in quantum gravity , without having to analyze models , one at a time .",
    "* acknowledgments : * we would like to thank martin bojowald , jim hartle and pablo laguna for discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nsf grants phy-0354932 and phy-0456913 , the alexander von humboldt foundation , and the eberly research funds of penn state .",
    "quantum corrections to the classical equations can be calculated using ideas from a geometric formulation of quantum mechanics where the hilbert space is regarded as ( an infinite dimensional ) phase space , the symplectic structure being given by the imaginary part of the hermitian inner product ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this ` quantum phase space ' has the structure of a bundle with the classical phase space as the base space , and all states with the same expectation values for the canonically conjugate operators @xmath577 as an ( infinite dimensional ) fiber .",
    "thus , any horizontal section provides an embedding of the classical phase space into the ` quantum phase space ' . in the case of a harmonic oscillator ( or free quantum fields ) coherent states constitute horizontal sections which are furthermore preserved by the full quantum dynamics . in the semi - classical sector",
    "defined by these coherent states , the effective hamiltonian coincides with the classical hamiltonian and there are no quantum corrections to classical dynamics . for more general systems , using suitable semi - classical states one may be able to find horizontal sections which are preserved by the quantum hamiltonian flow to a desired accuracy ( e.g. in an @xmath578 expansion ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian governing this flow the expectation value of the quantum hamiltonian operator in the chosen states , calculated to the desired accuracy is generally different from the classical hamiltonian . in this case , dynamics generated by the effective hamiltonian provides systematic quantum corrections to the classical dynamics @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure has been explicitly carried out in lqc for various matter sources @xcite . for a massless scalar field , the leading order quantum corrections",
    "are captured in the following effective hamiltonian constraint @xcite : [ heff0 ] c _ = - 6 ^ 2 _ o^2 |p|^12 ^ 2(_o c ) + 8gb(p ) p_^2 where @xmath579 is the eigenvalue of @xmath243 operator given by ( [ eq : bp ] ) .",

    "next , the positions of extremas and values of @xmath627 at them can be used to calculate coefficients @xmath628 at each extremum independently . if @xmath629 then these coefficients form sequences @xmath630 which converge to the analogous coefficients corresponding to @xmath622 as @xmath631 .",
    "finding the wdw limit of @xmath627 reduces then to finding the limit of @xmath630 .    in actual numerical work",
    "the following method was used :    * after given eigenfunction @xmath368 was calculated using the positions of extrema @xmath632 were found . * around the extrema the function @xmath368 supported on @xmath251 ( or @xmath253 ) was extended to neighborhoods of @xmath632 via polynomial interpolation .",
    "then the positions and values of extrema were recalculated with use of this extension .",
    "this allowed us to construct sequences converging to the wdw limit much more quickly than the ones constructed in the first step .",
    "the motivation for this construction is the expectation that for sufficiently large @xmath58 the values of @xmath368 at @xmath251 should be good estimates of its wdw limit ( being regular function defined on entire @xmath633 ) .",
    "* extrema found in previous step were next used to calculate sequences @xmath634 in a way analogous to that specified by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : axis])and ( [ eq : phase ] ) and in the description below them . * finally",
    "the limits of coefficients at @xmath635 were calculated by polynomial extrapolation .",
    "in this appendix we will construct a physical hilbert space @xmath636 in lqc which is qualitatively different from the spaces @xmath341 constructed in section [ s4.2 ] . in its features , it interpolates between these and the hilbert space @xmath204 of section [ s3.2 ] . for completeness",
    ", we will first explain why a new representation of the algebra of dirac observables can arise , then summarize the results and finally compare and contrast them with those obtained in sections [ s3.2 ] and [ s4.2 ] .",
    "the first part is somewhat technical but we have organized the presentation such that the readers can go directly to the summary without loss of continuity .",
    "let us begin by recalling the situation for a general system with a single constraint @xmath418 . in the refined version of dirac quantization @xcite",
    ", one introduces an auxiliary hilbert space @xmath637 , and represents the constraint by a self - adjoint operator @xmath638 on it .",
    "the technically difficult task is to chooses a dense sub - space @xmath206 of @xmath637 such that for all @xmath639 , ( _ f| : = _ -^d e^-i f|is a well - defined element of @xmath214 , such that the action @xmath640 of @xmath641 on @xmath642 yields a hermitian scalar product on the space of solutions @xmath643 to the quantum constraint ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "results in section [ s4.2 ] were obtained using @xmath644 for @xmath637 , and the space of rapidly decreasing functions @xmath645 in this @xmath637 for @xmath206 . in the lqc literature , @xmath206",
    "is sometimes called @xmath646 and @xmath214 is taken to be its algebraic dual , denoted by @xmath647 .",
    "the construction given above is rather general . for the model under consideration",
    ", we can extend this construction by using an entirely different subspace of @xmath214 for the auxiliary hilbert space .",
    "this is possible because by duality the action of @xmath638 can be extended to all of @xmath214 .",
    "let us set @xmath648 .",
    "this is a subspace of @xmath214 because each @xmath649 defines a linear map from @xmath206 to @xmath650 : ( |f:= _ _ -^b ( ) | ( , ) f ( , ) ^where the sum over @xmath58 converges because @xmath651 has support only on a countable number of points on the @xmath58-axis and a rapid fall - off .",
    "the dual action of @xmath638 on @xmath652 can now be calculated : since ( |f= _ _ -^b ( ) | it follows from the definitions of @xmath276 that ( ) ( , ) & = & ^2 ^2 + [ b()]^-1 ( c^+ ( ) ( + 4_o , ) + c^o ( ) ( , ) + c^- ( ) ( -4_o ) ) + & & ( , ) it is straightforward to verify that @xmath653 and @xmath638 are self - adjoint on @xmath652",
    ". therefore , we can carry out group averaging on @xmath654 and obtain a new physical hilbert space .",
    "as in the theory of section [ s3.2 ] , there are two superselected sectors .",
    "we will work with the positive frequency sector and denote it by @xmath655 .",
    "the dirac observables @xmath162 and @xmath197 on @xmath206 act by duality on @xmath652 and descend naturally to @xmath655 .",
    "the final results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the new physical hilbert space @xmath655 is the space of functions @xmath196 satisfying the positive frequency equation : @xmath656 , with finite norm : [ ip3]||||^ 2_phy = _ = _",
    "o db ( ) |(,)|^2 and the action of the dirac observables is the standard one : [ dirac5 ] ( , ) = e^i(-_o)|| ( , _ o ) , _ ( , ) = - i ( , ) .",
    "note that the final physical theory is different from both the theory of [ s3.2 ] and the ` standard ' lqc theory of [ s4.2 ] .",
    "since the inner product ( [ ip3 ] ) involves an integral rather than a sum , states @xmath196 now have support on continuous intervals of the @xmath58-axis as in the theory , rather than on a countable number of points as in lqc .",
    "however , the states satisfy the lqc type positive frequency equation @xmath656 , where the operator on the right is the square - root of a positive , self - adjoint _ difference _ operator rather than of a differential operator , and the measure determining the inner product also involves @xmath405 from lqc rather than @xmath406 from the theory .",
    "thus , the dynamical operator is the same as in lqc . _ in particular , as in section [ s5 ] , the quantum states exhibit a big bounce .",
    "_ however , since typical states are continuous on the @xmath58-axis , the spectrum of the dirac observable @xmath197 is now continuous .",
    "in essence , the states @xmath196 have support on _ 2-d continuous _ regions of the @xmath566 plane as in the theory but their dynamics is dictated by a _ difference _ operator as in lqc .",
    "when the cosmological constant is non - zero , the analog of this physical hilbert space appears to be a natural home to analyze the role of the kodama state in quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "in the literature on ` polymer representations ' , non - relativistic quantum mechanics of point particles and the quantum theory of a maxwell theory have been discussed in some detail@xcite . in the first case , the standard schrdinger hilbert space @xmath657 , and in the second case , the standard fock space turned out to be subspaces of @xmath647 which were especially helpful for semi - classical analysis .",
    "the present auxiliary hilbert space @xmath658 is completely analogous to these",
    ". therefore the resulting @xmath655 may be more useful for semi - classical considerations .",
    "indeed , since it does not refer to any @xmath271 , no coarse graining is required to carry out the semi - classical analysis .",
    "therefore the analog of this construction may well be useful in more general contexts in full lqg .",
