    "a major current goal of the field of nuclear physics is the experimental confirmation of the existence of a new phase of strongly interacting matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite , which is predicted to exist according to lattice calculations of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "enhanced production of strange hadrons , photons , and dileptons , and suppression of @xmath3 mesons are some of the proposed consequences of qgp formation .",
    "both @xmath3 suppression  @xcite and strangeness enhancement  @xcite have been observed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions with strongly enhanced nuclear effects . while these observations naturally lead to the conclusion that the initial phase of the collision consisted of a hot and dense system with strong rescattering , which may be explained by the assumption of qgp formation , the direct experimental detection of qgp through observation of direct emission of real or virtual photons from the quark matter remains to be attained .",
    "historically , photons and lepton - pairs were the probes first suggested to use to search for evidence of quark - gluon plasma formation in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . during the collision ,",
    "real photons are produced mainly by scattering amongst the electrically charged objects while virtual ( i.e. massive ) photons , which later decay into pairs of oppositely charged leptons , or dileptons , are produced mainly by particle - antiparticle annihilations .",
    "once produced , the real and virtual photons will interact with the surrounding hot dense matter through the electromagnetic interaction only .",
    "the resulting small interaction cross section implies a long mean free path in the dense matter with the consequence that the photons are likely to escape unscathed once produced . as a result ,",
    "real and virtual photons carry information about the conditions of the matter from which they were produced throughout the entire history of the heavy ion collision , including especially the initial hot dense phase .",
    "therefore , if the initial phase includes a quark - gluon plasma which radiates real and virtual photons differently than would dense hadronic matter this difference may be apparent in the photon and dilepton spectra observed by the experimentalist .",
    "this is in contrast to hadrons which , due to their extremely short mean free path in the hot dense matter , are unlikely to escape until the system has cooled and expanded to the low temperature and low density freezeout stage . as a result ,",
    "quark - gluon plasma formation during the initial stage of the collision will make its presence evident via hadronic probes only if it alters the macroscopic features of the system , such as its strangeness content or collective flow , in a way which is different from dense hadronic matter _ and _ if these altered features are preserved until the time of freezeout .",
    "thus the electromagnetic and hadronic probes provide complementary information .",
    "since the real and virtual photon emission rate is greatest in hot dense matter the electromagnetic probes should carry information mostly about the dynamics ( or thermodynamics ) of the initial phase of the collision , while hadronic probes carry information dominantly about the late stage of the collision .",
    "originally , feinberg  @xcite and shuryak  @xcite suggested that thermal emission might be an important process in hadron - induced and even lepton - induced reactions when a large multiplicity of particles are produced in the final state .",
    "in particular they pointed out that rescattering amongst the produced particles in local thermal equilibrium during the later stages of the interaction would give rise to real and virtual photon emission .",
    "( bjorken and weisberg made similar suggestions at that time about the possible importance of rescattering  @xcite ) .",
    "such a mechanism could explain the , at that time , puzzling excess dilepton yield observed at intermediate dilepton masses , @xmath4 gev / c@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "feinberg  @xcite speculated upon the nature of the hot prematter remaining after the interaction and suggested that it may even be gluonic matter with embedded quarks .",
    "shuryak  @xcite went on to assume formation of such a quark - gluon plasma in order to calculate the emission rates by perturbative qcd methods .",
    "while it remains unknown whether quark - gluon plasma may be produced in hadron - induced reactions , it was suggested shortly afterwards that relativistic collisions of heavy ions provide conditions likely to result in the production of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "initially it was suggested that such a plasma might occur at incident laboratory energies as low as a few gev per nucleon  @xcite due to compression of the colliding nuclei and the resulting high baryon density .",
    "another estimate based on extrapolations of known properties of nn and na collisions at energies of @xmath6 gev suggested that the fragmentation regions of aa collisions were likely to result in quark - gluon plasma formation  @xcite .",
    "later calculations solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equations indicated that the highest energy densities would instead occur in the mid - rapidity region with energy densities considered sufficient for qgp formation at incident energies of around 400 gev per nucleon  @xcite .",
    "almost concurrent with the suggestions to use relativistic heavy ions as a means to produce the qgp in the laboratory were suggestions to use dilepton or photon measurements to diagnose whether qgp has been formed .",
    "first estimates considering only the lowest order elementary processes and thermal parton distributions  @xcite concluded that the thermal dilepton emission rate from the qgp should exceed that from a hadronic gas in the mass region below the @xmath7 @xcite , and that real and virtual photons should provide accurate information on the temperature of the plasma  @xcite .",
    "a simple counting estimate indicated an expected photon enhancement relative to the number of pions in the case of qgp formation @xcite .",
    "first calculations which performed the space - time integration of the lowest order production rates by solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equations confirmed  @xcite that the dilepton yield in the mass region below the @xmath7 was sensitive to the initial temperature of the qgp and to the critical temperature .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested that the ratio of the simultaneously observed photon and dilepton pair yield might provide a signal which was sensitive to qgp formation while being insensitive to the details of the collision dynamics  @xcite .",
    "while these initial estimates indicated that photons and dileptons should be useful probes to diagnose the presence of qgp , the rate estimates themselves were suspect since lowest order perturbative calculations had been applied at energies , or temperatures , similar to @xmath8 , the qcd scale factor .",
    "the dilepton and photon rate estimates were put on firmer ground when mclerran and toimela @xcite , following the suggestion by feinberg  @xcite that the photon and dilepton rates could be determined from the expectation value of the electromagnetic current correlation function , demonstrated that for each order the emission rates had an invariant form with thermal structure functions entering in a manner exactly analogous to the usual structure functions for finding a quark or gluon in a hadron . also , it was observed that terms which contribute to the dilepton or photon emission which are problematic at the basic diagram level , are regularized in the qgp .",
    "for example , dilepton emission from quark - antiquark annihilation is infrared divergent in the limit of zero mass gluons while in the plasma gluons propagate as plasma oscillations with a plasmon mass which provides a cutoff to eliminate the divergences for small gluon momenta  @xcite .",
    "later , using the resummation techniques of braaten and pisarski  @xcite , kapusta et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the photon emission rates of quark gluon matter and hadronic matter were very similar .",
    "as a consequence , it could be concluded that while photon emission was not _",
    "per se _ a signature of quark gluon matter , detection of the emitted photons could provide a good measurement of the temperature of the hot and dense matter .",
    "recently , the situation has changed again with the demonstration by aurenche et al .",
    "@xcite that the contribution to the photon emission rate from two - loop diagrams are significantly larger than the lowest order contributions of the compton ( @xmath9 ) and annihilation ( @xmath10 ) processes which were previously thought to dominate the photon emission rate from the quark matter .",
    "the two - loop diagrams were shown to give a large bremsstrahlung ( @xmath11 ) contribution and a contribution from a previously neglected process of @xmath12 annihilation accompanied by q(g ) rescattering .",
    "this annihilation with rescattering process is found to dominate the photon emission rate of the quark matter at large transverse momenta .",
    "inclusion of these rates in hydrodynamic model calculations of heavy - ion collisions has recently shown that photon yield from the quark matter may be significantly larger than the photon yield from the hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "the direct photons may therefore dominantly carry information about the quark gluon plasma .    a large body of data on prompt photon emission exists for proton - induced reactions on targets of protons , anti - protons , and light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the prompt photon measurements have provided important input on gluon structure functions  @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to perform complete and fully consistent next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations of the prompt photon cross sections . in general ,",
    "the prompt photon data can be well described from fixed target energies up to tevatron energies  @xcite which provides an important foundation for the intrepretation of direct photon production in nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the past , discrepancies with calculation have sometimes been attributed to effects of intrinsic @xmath13 smearing arising from higher order contributions such as soft - gluon emissions  @xcite . while the evidence for intrinsic @xmath13 effects remains under debate  @xcite ,",
    "the observed trend of an underestimated prompt photon yield at low transverse momentum and low incident energy is suggestive of an intrinsic @xmath13 effect  @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of the source of this discrepancy will be important in the search for thermal direct photons at low transverse momentum in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the presently available low incident energies .",
    "first attempts to observe direct photon production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions with oxygen and sulphur beams found no significant excess  @xcite .",
    "the wa80 collaboration @xcite provided the most interesting result with a @xmath14 dependent upper limit on the direct photon production in s+au collisions at 200@xmath15gev .",
    "this result was subsequently used by several authors to rule out a simple version of the hadron gas scenario  @xcite and to establish an upper limit on the initial temperature of @xmath16 @xcite . in this paper , the first observation of direct photons from ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is reported for central 158  _ a _  gev @xmath0pb+@xmath0pb collisons .",

    "the target vacuum chamber is extended downstream in a @xmath23 conical vacuum chamber which contains the silicon drift detector ( sdd ) and the silicon pad multiplicity detector ( spmd )  @xcite , each consisting of 300 @xmath25 m thick silicon wafers .",
    "the sdd and spmd are located 12.5  cm and 30  cm downstream from the target , respectively .",
    "these detectors provide charged particle multiplicity measurement over the intervals of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    charged particle momentum measurement and particle identification is accomplished using two tracking spectrometer arms .",
    "the momentum measurement is accomplished by magnetic analysis in a large ( 1.6  m ) aperture dipole magnet called goliath which provides 1.6  tm bending power .",
    "both tracking spectrometers use straight - line tracking outside the magnetic field .",
    "particle identification is obtained using time - of - flight measured with scintillator slat detectors in each tracking arm . in the normal magnetic field configuration",

    "the first tracking arm consists of six planes of multi - step avalanche chambers  @xcite .",
    "the active area of the first tracking chamber is @xmath28  m@xmath5 while that of the other five chambers is @xmath29  m@xmath5 .",
    "the chambers produce uv photons by means of a photoemissive vapor which are then converted to visible light via wavelength shifter plates . on exiting the chamber ,",

    "the photon spectrometer is described in more detail below .",
    "further downstream , at a distance of 24.7  m from the target , the total transverse energy is measured in the mirac calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the mirac is a sampling calorimeter with 180 calorimeter towers readout on two sides with wavelength shifter plates coupled to photomultipliers .",
    "each tower is segmented longitudinally to provide separate measurement of the electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposit .",
    "a portion of the signal from each photomultiplier of mirac is split off and the analog signal is summed with appropriate weight to form a total transverse energy signal for trigger purposes .",
    "the mirac is deployed in a rectangular wall 3.3  m wide by 2.4  m high centered on the beam axis with a central aperture 61  cm wide by 23  cm high through which the beam passes .",

    "finally , the total energy of the uninteracting beam , or of the residual beam fragments and produced particles emitted near to zero degrees , is measured in the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) .",
    "the zdc consists of 35 lead / scintillator sampling calorimeter modules of @xmath36  cm@xmath5 cross sectional area each . for each module",
    "the scintillator is read out from the side with a fast wavelength shifter plate coupled to a photomultiplier with an active base .",
    "this allowed stable operation with intensities up to 1 mhz of the full 33 tev @xmath0pb beam .",
    "the zdc modules were stacked in an array 7 modules wide by 5 modules high .",

    "the cave is located just behind mirac with an entrance aperture the same size as the aperture through mirac .    in order to minimize backgrounds ,",
    "wa98 has been designed with attention to minimize the amount of material in the beamline and in the flight paths of the detected particles .",
    "thus , except for trigger detectors in the beamline and a small air gap in the goliath magnet , the beam is transported in an evacuated beampipe ( not shown in fig .",

    "the first beam tube is of 5  cm diameter and 1.44  m length followed by a second tube of 10  cm diameter and 4.5  m length .",
    "a third beam tube continues through the experiment with a 20  cm diameter to the front of the mirac calorimeter where it attaches to a rectangular vacuum pipe which defines the aperture in mirac and terminates the vacuum at the rear of mirac just before the entrance to the zdc .",

    "a clean beam trigger is defined as a signal in the start counter , located 3.5 m upstream of the target , with no coincident signal in the veto scintillator counter ( which had a 3 mm diameter circular hole and was located 2.7 m upstream of the target ) , or in beam halo scintillator counters which covered the region from the veto counter to 25 cm transverse to the beam axis .",
    "beam fragments from upstream interactions are rejected by use of a high threshold on the start counter signal , set just below the @xmath0pb signal .",

    "additional background event rejection is performed offline using the amplitude and timing information from the trigger detectors . for purposes of background rejection",
    "each of the trigger logic signals is copied multiple times and recorded on tdcs with various delayed starts or delayed stops which allow to inspect the time period immediately preceeding or following the trigger event .",
    "this set of tdcs allows to reject pileup beam particles or interactions over preceeding or following time ranges of 100  ns , 500  ns , or 10  @xmath39s in the offline analysis .",
    "the mirac calorimeter provides an analog total transverse energy sum for centrality selection for online trigger purposes .",
    "the wa98 minimum bias trigger requires a clean beam trigger with a mirac transverse energy signal which exceeds a low threshold .",
    "two additional trigger signals are derived from the mirac transverse energy signal using thresholds set somewhat above and far above the minimum bias threshold .",
    "these three mirac thresholds define three non - overlapping event classes which are used to define the wa98 physics triggers .",
    "the thresholds were adjusted such that the so - called peripheral event class , between the lowest and next - to - lowest thresholds , corresponded to about 20% of the minimum bias event rate and the central event class , above the highest threshold , corresponded to about 10% of the minimum bias event rate .",
    "the remaining @xmath41 of the minimum bias cross section between central and peripheral event classes is referred to as the not - so - central event class .",
    "taken together the three event classes were equivalent to the minimum bias event class . in normal run operation the central event class triggers were taken without prescale factor while the peripheral event triggers were typically downscaled by a factor of two and the not - so - central triggers were usually prescaled by a factor of 32 ( after deadtime suppression ) for the 1995 run period .",
    "for the 1996 run period the peripheral and not - so - central event classes were typically downscaled by a factor of 4 and 16 , respectively .",

    "the cpv detector is nearly transparent to high energy photons with only 2.0% of incident photons converting and producing detectable signals inside the streamer tubes .",

    "an overview of the method is presented followed by a discussion of the details of the photon identification criteria and the photon and @xmath17 efficiency determination .",
    "these are the main sources of systematical error in the present direct photon analysis .",
    "next , the method to determine the charged particle contamination in the photon yield is discussed .",
    "then the calculation of the photon background expected from radiative decays of long - lived resonances is described .",
    "finally , the extraction of the direct photon excess is discussed .      due to the high photon multiplicity in central pb+pb collisions , and the limited photon spectrometer acceptance",
    ", it is not feasible to identify isolated single direct photons on an event - by - event basis . instead",
    ", in the direct photon analysis presented here , the transverse momentum distribution of direct photons is determined on a statistical basis . in brief , the direct photon excess is extracted from the difference between the measured inclusive photon yield and the photon yield predicted from a calculation of the radiative decays of long - lived resonances . among such decay photons ,",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 comprise the largest source , contributing roughly 97% of the photon yield according to the expected relative abundances of produced particles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : photon_pt_bkg ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the sensitivity of the measurement to a direct photon excess , it is imperative to accurately determine the @xmath17 and @xmath18 yield .    in the wa98 measurement , the",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 yield are determined via their two - photon decay branch for exactly the same event sample for which the inclusive photon yield is measured .",
    "this eliminates all systematical error sources related to absolute cross section normalization or centrality selection .",
    "in fact , this analysis method allows to determine the decay background correctly even if data sets with very different centralities or run conditions were combined arbitrarily since the averaged decay photon distribution would follow directly from the averaged @xmath17 and @xmath18 distributions .",
    "thus , for example , contributions from background sources such as a secondary target will not produce an apparent photon excess in this analysis , as long as their contribution to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 yield can be extracted from the two - photon invariant mass peaks .",
    "such background sources would distort the extracted @xmath17 and @xmath18 transverse momentum distributions , but this distortion would also be reflected in the inclusive photon distribution .",
    "similarly , a distortion of the photon momentum distribution due to a calibration error or non - linearity of the detector response would be reflected in the momentum ( and mass ) distribution of the reconstructed @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s .",
    "this means that the sensitivity of the direct photon search to detector calibration or non - linearity errors is reduced in this analysis .",
    "furthermore , the momentum dependence of the @xmath17 invariant mass peak provides an _ in situ _ means to verify and quantify the accuracy of the detector calibration .",
    "a major source of systematical error in the present analysis is the determination of the photon detection efficiency .",
    "roughly speaking , since the photon detection efficiency enters quadratically in the efficiency correction of the @xmath17 yield extracted via its two - photon decay , but only linearly in the photon yield correction , an error in the photon detection efficiency directly modifies the apparent photon excess .",
    "thus a major emphasis of the present analysis is to demonstrate an accurate determination of the identification efficiencies and associated systematical errors .",
    "this is accomplished by applying different photon identification criteria having very different efficiencies and sensitivities to backgrounds , and verifying that the final corrected results are consistent in all cases .",
    "another source of error may be due to mis - identified non - photon backgrounds .",
    "since the number of charged hadrons exceeds the number of photons by about a factor of three at large transverse momenta , they pose a large potential background of apparent excess photons if mis - identified as photons .",
    "fortunately , high energy hadrons deposit only a small fraction of their incident energy in the lead - glass detector ( its 40  cm length is about one interaction length ) . as a result , showers with large energy deposit , or large apparent transverse momentum , are predominantly photons with a hadron contamination of only about @xmath61 .",
    "since hadronic showers typically have large transverse dimension the hadron shower contamination can be further reduced by a factor of 2 - 3 by excluding showers with large width .",
    "since the magnetic field alters the distribution and apparent transverse momenta of the charged hadrons while leaving the neutral particle distributions unchanged , a comparison of the extracted neutral shower result for magnetic field on and field off provides a consistency check of the charged hadron rejection .",
    "the charged particle veto detector is used to determine the charged hadron contribution to the photon spectrum .",
    "another source of apparent photons is neutrons and anti - neutrons .",
    "this contribution is estimated by simulation only .",
    "its contribution can similarly be reduced by excluding showers with large width .",
    "consistency in the final result with different shower identification criteria and run conditions provides confirmation that the background contributions are properly eliminated .",
    "the most critical requirement of the direct photon search is an accurate determination of the inclusive photon and @xmath17 yields . in general ,",
    "the accuracy of the yield determination is verified by using different identification criteria with large differences in efficiency and background sensitivity , and demonstrating consistent final results .",
    "the @xmath17 yield is largely insensitive to background particles since the @xmath17 s are self - identified by their mass peak in the two - photon invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the effect of background particles is mainly to increase the combinatorial background in the invariant mass spectrum which makes the problem of extraction of the peak content more difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "charged hadrons and neutrons are significant backgrounds to the photon yield determination . in the present analysis ,",
    "the charged particle veto detector is used to identify charged hadron showers and remove the charged hadron contribution from the photon spectrum . at the same time , care must be taken not to remove converted photons from the photon or @xmath17 data .",
    "the photon yield extraction involves the following steps :    * the photon identification criteria are applied to the reconstructed showers and a photon candidate @xmath62 spectrum is accumulated . *",
    "the normalized target - out background photon candidate @xmath62 spectrum is subtracted , if necessary . *",
    "the cpv detector is used to determine the charged hadron contamination included in the photon candidate spectrum .",
    "the charged shower contribution is subtracted from the photon candidate distribution to produce the uncorrected neutral shower @xmath62 spectrum .",
    "* the neutral shower spectrum is corrected for photon conversions and for the reconstruction efficiency . * the neutron and anti - neutron contamination , based on simulation ,",
    "is removed to produce the raw photon @xmath62 spectrum , within the lead - glass detector acceptance . * the raw photon spectrum is corrected for the geometrical acceptance to produce the final photon @xmath62 spectrum .    the @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 )",
    "yield extraction involves the following steps :    * the photon identification criteria are applied to the reconstructed showers to produce a list of photon candidates for each event . * the invariant mass of each photon pair within an event",
    "is calculated and sorted into invariant mass histograms according to the @xmath62 of the photon pair .",
    "an invariant mass histogram is accumulated for each @xmath62 bin to be used in the final @xmath17 @xmath62 spectrum . *",
    "the photons are simultaneously used to construct artificial mixed events of similar multiplicity for each centrality class .",
    "the mixed events are analyzed in exactly the same manner as the real events to produce background invariant mass spectra as a function of @xmath62 . *",
    "the final mixed event invariant mass spectra are normalized and subtracted from the the final real event invariant mass spectra to remove the combinatorial background from the real event spectra . *",
    "the normalized target - out final invariant mass spectra are subtracted from the final invariant mass spectra , if necessary . *",
    "the final invariant mass spectra are analyzed to extract the content in the @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) peak at each @xmath62 .",
    "the result is the uncorrected @xmath17 @xmath62 spectrum . *",
    "the @xmath17 @xmath62 spectrum is corrected for the @xmath17 reconstruction efficiency and losses due to photon conversions to produce the raw @xmath17 @xmath62 spectrum within the lead - glass detector acceptance . * the raw @xmath17 spectrum is corrected for the geometrical acceptance and photon energy threshold to produce the final @xmath17 @xmath62 spectrum .    for both the photon and @xmath17 analysis , the shower reconstruction itself involves the following steps @xcite : first , all lead - glass detector modules with energy deposit are analyzed and contiguous modules are associated together as a cluster . the list of clusters is then analyzed to determine the number of local maxima in each cluster .",
    "clusters with a single maximum are treated as single showers .",
    "clusters with multiple maxima are assumed to result from overlapping showers , with one shower per maximum .",
    "the energy deposit in each module in the cluster is partitioned to the overlapping showers according to the distance of the module from the shower maxima , assuming all showers to have electromagnetic radial shower profiles .",
    "the individual showers are then analyzed to calculate the total shower energy , position , and spatial dispersion ( width ) @xcite .",
    "the shower positions are calculated with a logarithmic weighting of the energy deposit @xcite and are projected to the front surface of the lead - glass detector , correcting for the shower depth and the non - projective geometry .",
    "the distance from the shower position to the nearest hit in the cpv is also extracted .",
    "all of this information is recorded on data summary tapes ( dsts ) as an intermediate analysis step .",
    "after application of the minimum energy threshold of 750 mev used in the analysis and acceptance calculations , the showers are subject to various sets of further identification criteria .",
    "the different criteria result in varying non - photon background contaminations and photon ( @xmath17 ) identification efficiencies , which must then be determined . in order to avoid shower distortions near the detector edges , or around `` dead '' detector modules ,",
    "an edge cut is applied to require that the reconstructed shower position lies beyond a specified distance from the detector edges or dead modules .",
    "a distance cut of two module widths from the detector edge and 1.5 modules widths from the center of a dead module was used .    in the present analysis ,",
    "the photon selection has been made with the following shower identification criteria :    * use all reconstructed showers .",
    "* use only narrow showers which have a dispersion ( width ) which is less than a specified value .",
    "* use only showers which have no associated cpv hit .",
    "* use narrow showers satisfying the dispersion cut with no cpv hit .",
    "the first condition will have the highest photon identification efficiency but largest non - photon background contribution , while the last condition will have the lowest efficiency but lowest background contributions .",
    "for the extraction of the photon yield , the criteria s1 and s2 are not entirely independent from the criteria s3 and s4 since the cpv detector is used in the first case also to determine the charged hadron contamination .",
    "the distinction is mainly in the manner in which the data is processed and in how the corrections are applied . in particular , with criteria s3 and s4 the neutral shower distribution is acquired directly , but must be corrected for photons which were rejected due to random associated hits in the cpv , or due to photon conversions , while for criteria s1 and s2 the charged shower distributions are extracted using the cpv and corrected for random associated hits and conversions and then the corrected charged shower contribution is removed from the total shower distribution to obtain the neutral shower distribution . for the @xmath17 yield extraction the cpv is not used at all when criteria s1 or s2 are used with the result that no corrections for random cpv hits are needed and smaller conversion corrections are required .",
    "criteria s2 and s4 make use of the fact that the transverse size of hadronic showers , with large energy deposit , is significantly greater than that of electromagnetic showers in the lead - glass calorimeter .",
    "the cut on the shower dispersion is chosen to accept more than @xmath60 of the isolated photon showers while rejecting hadron showers by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "however , the shower dispersion cut is more likely to lose electromagnetic showers in the case of shower overlap .    for additional consistency checks ,",
    "the data has also been analyzed with the shower energy threshold increased from 750 mev to 1.5 gev , with the outer edge module cut increased to three module widths , and with a photon energy asymmetry cut applied in the @xmath17 analysis .",
    "the large particle multiplicities in central pb+pb collisions result in module occupancies in the wa98 lead - glass detector of up to @xmath63 , which poses a special problem for the direct photon search .",
    "these large occupancies result in overlapping showers in which photons may be lost , mis - identified , or significantly altered in position or energy .",
    "this results in a significant dependence of the photon and @xmath17 identification efficiency on the centrality of the collision .",
    "furthermore , the position and energy resolution , and even the energy scale , will be centrality dependent due to the effect of shower overlap .",
    "for an accurate direct photon search it is imperative to accurately determine and account for these effects . for the present analysis",
    "this has been accomplished by the method of randomly inserting test showers into real events and studying how they are altered and the efficiency with which they are recovered .",
    "this procedure has been used to determine the @xmath64 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 reconstruction efficiency .    for this reconstruction procedure",
    "the wa98 experiment geometry was implemented in geant @xcite with the geant tracking parameters for leda adjusted to reproduce test beam measurements of the leda response to electrons .",
    "the generation and transport of erenkov photons in geant was parameterized and this parameterized erenkov response was used in the full wa98 geant simulation due to the prohibitive cpu - time consumption of the full erenkov tracking in geant .",
    "single @xmath17 s ( @xmath18 s ) were simulated with a uniform distribution in transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity over the leda acceptance and the decay photons were tracked through geant .",
    "the simulated leda response was recorded to create a library of photon test showers in the form of digitized leda signals . only simulated @xmath17 s with both decay photons in the nominal leda acceptance were recorded .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency was then extracted with the procedure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geant ] .",
    "first the raw data were calibrated and the event was characterized by the trigger detectors and other detectors of wa98 . then three passes were made through the leda event analysis software . in the first pass",
    ", the calibrated leda data was analyzed to perform the clustering and shower characterization as described above .",
    "the position , energy , shower dispersion , and distance to nearest hit in the cpv were saved for all identified showers together with the calibrated information from the other wa98 detectors .",
    "next , a @xmath17 event was read from the shower library and inserted into an empty leda raw event .",
    "simulated signals in dead modules were eliminated and the event was then analyzed as a real event .",
    "the shower information reconstructed from the simulated showers in the empty leda was recorded together with the primary @xmath17 and photon information prior to the geant response .",
    "finally , the real leda event was overlaid with the simulated leda event and the signals were summed .",
    "then the superimposed event was analyzed . in this step",
    "the position , energy , shower dispersion , and distance to nearest hit in the cpv were saved only for all new showers which were not in the list of showers found in the original raw event .",
    "also , all showers of the original event found to be missing from the reanalyzed overlap event were marked as lost .",
    "all of this information was stored for each event in a single pass through the wa98 raw data and recoded on the data summary tapes .",
    "thereafter the data analysis was performed from the dsts since they could easily be analyzed multiple times , or simultaneously , with different shower selection criteria .    in order to determine the photon reconstruction efficiency it is necessary to determine which shower in the overlap event corresponds to the simulated photon incident on the leda . in the first step",
    ", the empty leda geant shower information is analyzed to determine the reconstructed position of the highest energy shower in the vicinity of the incident geant photon . the overlap event is then analyzed to find the shower nearest to that position .",
    "if that shower has less than twice the energy of the shower in the empty leda event it is taken as the reconstructed photon .",
    "otherwise the photon is considered to be lost .",
    "after the associated shower is identified , it is tested to determine whether it passes the photon energy threshold requirement and whether it passes the detector edge cut . also ,",
    "if its position falls on the location of a so - called `` bad '' module with questionable gain , as described below , it is eliminated .",
    "finally , it is tested against the various shower identification criteria s1-s4 described above .",
    "the efficiency corrections are made as a function of the measured transverse momenta .",
    "the photon reconstruction efficiency can be constructed as a two - dimensional response matrix which transforms the transverse momentum of the incident photon into the transverse momentum of the reconstructed test shower , if it passes all identification criteria ( the reconstructed transverse momentum is set to zero if the criteria are not satisfied ) .",
    "this two - dimensional efficiency matrix must then be inverted and applied to the measured transverse momentum distribution to obtain the final efficiency corrected result  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the efficiency can be applied as an iterative one - dimensional correction . in this case ,",
    "one - dimensional histograms are accumulated of the incident transverse momentum and reconstructed transverse momentum with each entry weighted according to the final transverse momentum spectrum and rapidity distribution .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency is given as the ratio of reconstructed to input distributions .",
    "this one - dimensional efficiency determination must be iterated until the weighted input distribution matches the final measured distribution .",
    "efficiency determination .",
    "the intermediate results are recorded to dsts after the event analysis step .",
    "the shower selection and further analysis is performed on the dsts . ]    the @xmath17 reconstruction efficiency is similarly obtained by requiring that the showers from both of the decay photons simultaneously pass the photon identification criteria .",
    "the @xmath17 mass and transverse momentum is then calculated from the momenta of the two reconstructed photon showers .",
    "it is then required that the reconstructed mass fall within the @xmath17 peak mass integration region , and it may be additionally required that the photons pass an asymmetry ( @xmath65 ) cut on their reconstructed energies .",
    "the @xmath17 reconstruction efficiency is applied as a one - dimensional function of the transverse momentum .",
    "as in the photon case , the correction is determined from the ratio of reconstructed to input transverse momentum distributions . the input @xmath17 transverse momentum and rapidity weights must be adjusted by iteration until the assumed input transverse momentum distribution is the same as the final corrected distribution .    it should be noted that while these correction factors have been referred to as efficiency corrections , they might more properly be termed response corrections .",
    "they include essentially all detector effects other than the nominal detector acceptance .",
    "specifically , they include the effects of detector edge cuts , dead and bad modules , energy resolution , and distortions or loss due to shower overlap , as well as the efficiency to satisfy the specified identification criteria .",
    "in particular , the correction for smearing due to overlap and energy resolution can result in efficiency correction factors which exceed unity .      as described above , the direct photon excess is obtained from the difference between the measured inclusive photon yield and the background photon yield expected from radiative decays of long - lived final state hadrons . the background photon yield in the wa98 leda acceptance",
    "is calculated by a monte carlo simulation of radiative decays of hadrons .",
    "the most important input to this calculation is the measured wa98 @xmath17 yield , which is extracted from the same data sample used to obtain the inclusive photon yield ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geant ] ) .",
    "photons from @xmath17 decay account for about @xmath66 of the total expected background from radiative decays .",
    "it is important to note that the background photon yield attributed to @xmath17 decay includes both directly produced @xmath17 s , as well as those from hadronic decays with @xmath17 s in their final state .",
    "thus , photons resulting from the @xmath67 decay branch of the @xmath18 are taken into account via the measured @xmath17 yield .",
    "on the other hand , the lifetime of the @xmath68 is sufficiently long that few of the @xmath67 weak decays occur in front of the leda detector and therefore there is little contribution to the @xmath17 yield , and hence little contribution to the background photon yield .",
    "however , the weak decay of the @xmath69 to @xmath70 is a special case .",
    "the @xmath69 lifetime is such that a substantial fraction of the decays are distributed over the distance between the target and the leda detector . as with the @xmath68 contribution ,",
    "those decays which occur beyond the leda distance do not contribute to the @xmath17 or background photon yield .",
    "on the other hand , photons from a @xmath17 produced in a @xmath69 decay will have correctly measured energies but will be assumed to be produced at the target location and therefore will have an incorrect opening angle .",
    "this will result in a reconstructed @xmath17 invariant mass which is incorrect .",
    "while @xmath69 decays which occur close to the target will have a reconstructed @xmath17 mass which falls into the @xmath17 identification window , and so its decay photon contribution will be included via the measured @xmath17 yield , some fraction of the @xmath69 decays will occur sufficiently far from the target that their @xmath17 decays will not be properly identified .",
    "only this portion of the @xmath69 decay photon contribution must be included in the calculated photon background .",
    "the @xmath71 decay of the @xmath18 is the second most important contribution to the photon decay background after the @xmath17 contribution .",
    "together the @xmath17 and @xmath18 photon decays constitute approximately @xmath72 of the expected radiative decay background ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : photon_pt_bkg ] ) .",
    "compared to the @xmath17 yield measurement the @xmath18 measurement is more difficult due to the smaller production rate , the smaller @xmath71 decay branching ratio , and the resulting smaller signal to combinatorial background ratio in the @xmath71 invariant mass distribution . in the present analysis , the @xmath18 yield is measured with modest statistical accuracy over a limited transverse momentum range due to these difficulties . in order to extrapolate the measured @xmath18 transverse momentum distribution into unmeasured regions it is assumed that the @xmath18 yield obeys @xmath73-scaling .",
    "this is the phenomenological observation @xcite that the differential invariant cross sections , plotted as a function of the transverse mass @xmath74 , for the various hadrons , @xmath75 , have the same form , @xmath76 , with a normalization factor , @xmath77 , which can vary but is found to be the same for many species : @xmath78 quite different theoretical explanations @xcite can account for this observation . for various proton and pion - induced reactions at similar incident energies",

    "it also allowed to use the full 1996 data sample including periods when the cpv was not fully operational .",
    "it should be noted that the 1995 and 1996 run conditions and analysis procedures were the same , and so the amount of charged hadron contamination extracted from the 1996 data sample should be the same for the 1995 data sample .",
    "a minor difference between the two data samples is the thicker target used for the 1995 run period which resulted in an additional 1.55% conversion probability . for the magnet off data sample",

    "further study will be necessary to improve the theoretical predictions of the prompt photon contribution as well as the non - equilibrium contributions .",
    "on the other hand , the hydrodynamical model calculations which provide a time integration of the emission rate with a very short initial formation time and high initial temperature may provide a reasonable approximation of the contributions from the early non - equilibrium phase of the collision  @xcite .",
    "further studies will also be necessary to determine how the present direct photon results might further constrain the qgp and non - qgp scenarios .",
    "the wa80 direct photon upper limit for central s+au collisions  @xcite was able to rule out thermal emission from purely hadronic matter in which the hadronic matter consisted of a simple pion gas with few degrees of freedom  @xcite due to the constraints which the result implied on the initial temperature  @xcite .",
    "the s+au direct photon limit has been shown to be consistent with the qgp transition using the new rates for quark matter , although with somewhat different parameters than presented here  @xcite .",
    "it will be important to determine whether the present result , combined with other measurements including the s+au direct photon upper limit , can provide further constraints and provide compelling evidence for the qgp phase transition scenario .",
    "a search for direct photons in @xmath0pb+@xmath0pb collisions at 158  _ a _",
    "gev has been performed using the large - area finely - segmented lead - glass calorimeter of the wa98 experiment .",
    "the analysis has been performed on nearly equal - sized event samples of the 10% most central and 20% most peripheral fractions of the total minimum bias cross section .",
    "the inclusive photon and @xmath17 transverse momentum distributions were measured for each event sample .",
    "constraints were also obtained on the @xmath18 transverse momentum distribution for central collisions with a modest accuracy which was limited by statistics .",
    "the systematical error sources were discussed at length with particular attention to demonstrate the accuracy of the systematical error estimates . the total systematical error for the direct photon analysis varied from about 6% to 10% over the @xmath62 region of interest , and varied with the centrality selection .",
    "the direct photon excess was extracted on a statistical basis as the difference between the measured inclusive spectrum of photons within the detector acceptance and the calculated spectrum of photons which result from all hadrons with significant radiative decay contributions .",
    "the dominant decay contributions are those from the measured @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s .",
    "no significant direct photon excess was observed for the peripheral event sample for transverse momenta up to about 2.5 gev / c .",
    "this upper @xmath62 limit of the measurement was imposed by the increasing statistical error at large @xmath62 due to the low particle multiplicity for peripheral collisions .",
    "in contrast , a significant direct photon excess was observed over the @xmath62 region of about 1.5 gev / c to 3.5 gev / c for central @xmath0pb+@xmath0pb collisions . at transverse momenta",
    "where the observed excess was not significant , a 90% confidence level upper limit on the direct photon excess was given .",
    "this extended the result to the full region of measurement from 0.5 gev / c to 4 gev / c .",
    "the observed direct photon yield was compared to a next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculation at the same @xmath212 ( = 17.3 gev ) and scaled according to the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions calculated for the selected central event class .",
    "the measured direct photon yield was about a factor of 2 - 3 above the pqcd calculation which included the effects of partonic intrinsic @xmath13 with a parameter which gave a good description of proton - induced prompt photon results at the nearest incident energy ( @xmath212=19.4 gev ) .",
    "a nlo pqcd calculation without intrinsic @xmath13 was about an order of magnitude below the measured result .",
    "the results suggest that the additional direct photon yield in central @xmath0pb+@xmath0pb collisions is the result of additional rescatterings in the dense matter .",
    "the measured results can be well - described by hydrodynamical model calculations which include a quark gluon plasma phase transition with an initial temperature of @xmath268 mev and a critical temperature of @xmath264 mev  @xcite .",
    "the photon emission from the quark matter is found to dominate over the contribution from the hadronic matter due to the recently identified process of annihilation with rescattering  @xcite which is only expected to occur in dense quark matter .",
    "it will be important to determine the uniqueness of this interpretation .",
