    "our proof relies on heat trace invariants and also some new wave trace invariants associated to some diffractive billiard trajectories .",
    "we first use the method of reflections to express the dirichlet and neumann wave kernels in terms of the wave kernel of the _ double of the trapezoid _ which can be realized as a euclidean surface with conical singularities ( escs ) .",
    "we then obtain new wave trace invariants using two results of hillairet @xcite for escs .",
    "the first is a parametrix construction of the wave propagator near diffractive geodesics as an fio , which we will use for the reflected term .",
    "such paramatrices were found by cheeger - taylor @xcite , however expressing them in the language of fios was first done by hillairet in @xcite . for the non - reflected term we use trace formulas of @xcite associated to isolated diffractive geodesics and to one - parameter families of regular geodesics with _ geometrically diffractive _ boundaries .",
    "more precisely we apply the trace formulas of @xcite to the diffractive bouncing ball orbit associated to the top edge of the trapezoid ( figure [ b ] ) , and to the one - parameter family of bouncing ball orbits associated to the altitudes of the trapezoid ( figure [ h ] ) .",
    "the lengths of these orbits and the principal terms of the singularity expansions of the neumann wave trace at these lengths provide new spectral invariants for the trapezoid .",
    "together with the well known heat trace invariants , these can be used to prove spectral uniqueness of a trapezoid amongst all trapezoids .",
    "the reason we can only treat the neumann case is that in some sense the wave trace is  more singular \" for the neumann case when compared to the dirichlet case .",
    "this is a new feature which is of independent interest .",

    ". it would be interesting to study the singularity of the dirichlet wave trace at @xmath5 ( if singular at all ) , but since we do not require this for our inverse result for the neumann boundary condition , we refrain from exploring this question here . in a future work we shall study the isospectral problem in the dirichlet case .    .",

    "the isospectral problem is : if two riemannian manifolds are isospectral , then are they isometric ? for a riemannian manifold @xmath10 the spectrum in question is for the laplace operator @xmath11 the answer in this generality is _ no , _ and was proven by milnor in 1964 @xcite .",
    "he used a construction of witt @xcite of two self - dual lattices @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 such that no rotation of @xmath14 maps one to the other , but such that the spectra of the riemannian manifolds @xmath15 are identical for @xmath16 , @xmath17 . around the same time",
    ", m. kac wrote a popular article @xcite , `` can one hear the shape of a drum ? ''",

    "for both boundary conditions , the eigenvalues , which depend on @xmath25 , form a discrete subset of @xmath26 of the form @xmath27 . in the dirichlet case ,",
    "the spectrum is in bijection with the resonant frequencies a drum would produce if @xmath18 were its drumhead . with a perfect ear one could hear all these frequencies and therefore know the spectrum .",
    "this is the origin of the title of kac s paper @xcite .",
    "gordon , webb , and wolpert answered kac s question in the negative @xcite , based on buser s work @xcite .",
    "the isospectral problem for surfaces was previously demonstrated to have a negative answer by @xcite .",
    "buser s method relied on a pasting procedure for pairs of surfaces . in @xcite , they determined how to suitably `` fold '' two such curved surfaces to create isospectral non - isometric planar domains .",
    "this general idea of folding paper was later presented in an accessible style by chapman @xcite .    on the other hand , in some cases",
    "the isospectral problem has a positive answer .",
    "if one considers for example triangular domains in the plane , then if two such domains are isospectral , the triangles are congruent .",
    "the first proof of this fact is contained in the doctoral thesis of c. durso @xcite .",
    "she used the fact that the heat trace implies that the area and perimeter are spectral invariants , so any two triangles which are isospectral must have the same area and perimeter . to complete the proof",
    ", she used the wave trace and demonstrated that the length of the shortest closed geodesic in a triangular domain is also a spectral invariant .",
    "more recently grieser and maronna @xcite realized that if one used an additional spectral invariant from the heat trace , then this together with the area and perimeter uniquely determine the triangle .",
    "that is a much simpler proof .",
    "other types of domains which are known to be spectrally determined are analytic planar domains with reflective symmetries ; see the works of colin de verdire @xcite and zelditch @xcite .",
    "after triangles , one is naturally interested to know whether the same result may hold for quadrilaterals . for rectangles",
    ", this is a straightforward exercise to prove that if two rectangles are isospectral , then they are congruent .",
    "in fact , one only requires the first two eigenvalues to prove this fact . for parallelograms , it is also a straightforward argument using the first three heat trace invariants as in @xcite .",
    "of course the next natural generalization is to trapezoids . in this case",
    ", one can rather easily prove that the geometric information which can be extracted from the heat trace is insufficient to prove that isospectral trapezoids are congruent .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use the wave trace in the spirit of @xcite , which is a much more delicate matter .",
    "+ in  [ spectralinvariants ] , we review heat trace invariants associated to polygons and we also discover some new wave trace invariants for trapezoids . in  [ proofsofprops ] , we prove the main propositions on wave trace invariants using @xcite .",
    "finally , in  [ proofofmain ] we prove our inverse spectral result .",
    "a _ trapezoid _ is a convex quadrilateral which has two parallel sides of lengths @xmath28 and @xmath25 with @xmath29 .",
    "the side of length @xmath25 is called the _ base . _",
    "the two angles @xmath30 adjacent to the base are called base angles .",
    "the angles at the base satisfy @xmath31 the other two sides of the trapezoid are known as _",
    "legs _ of lengths @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath34 , then we say the trapezoid is _ isosceles . _",
    "the distance between two parallel sides is called the _ height . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _        any quantity which is uniquely determined by the spectrum is known as a _ spectral invariant . _ _ _    [ notation ] if we are considering different boundary conditions on a domain @xmath18 , we shall use the notation @xmath35 to indicate the boundary condition @xmath25 .",
    "if we are considering a compact riemannian manifold @xmath36 without boundary we shall use @xmath37 .",
    "we shall use these notations when @xmath18 is a polygon , and when @xmath36 is the double of a polygon as a compact euclidean surface with conic singularities .",
    "the heat trace @xmath38 is a spectral invariant .",
    "it is an analytic function for @xmath39 and has a singularity at @xmath40 .",
    "it is well known in this setting ( see @xcite ) that the heat trace on a polygonal domain @xmath41 admits an asymptotic expansion . ] as @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 when @xmath22 , and @xmath46 if @xmath24 . above , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote respectively the area and perimeter of the domain @xmath41 , and @xmath49 are the interior angles . since the angles of a trapezoid are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , we therefore have the following :    [ angleinvariant ] for a trapezoidal domain , the area @xmath54 , perimeter @xmath55 , and the angle invariant @xmath56 are spectral invariants .",
    "note that by the definition of a trapezoid , @xmath57 and equality holds if and only if the trapezoid is actually a rectangle .",
    "one can show that these quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are insufficient to determine a trapezoid .",
    "in other words , considering any trapezoid @xmath61 , up to congruence via rigid motions of the plane , there are infinitely many different trapezoids which have the same @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the remainder term in the heat trace decays exponentially as @xmath42 , as shown by @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not feasible to extract further geometric information from the heat trace so we shall turn to a more subtle spectral invariant : the wave trace .",
    "the wave trace is the trace of the wave propagator , also known as the wave group , and is formally @xmath62 this is purely formal , since the wave trace is only well - defined when paired with a schwartz class test function ; it is a tempered distribution by an easy application of weyl s law .",
    "it is defined in more general settings such as compact riemannian manifolds without boundary as well as with boundary and with various boundary conditions .",
    "duistermaat - guillemin @xcite showed that in the case of compact riemannian manifolds without boundary the singular support of the wave trace is contained in @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the set of lengths of closed geodesics .",
    "they also found the principal term in the singularity expansion when the orbit is single and non - degenerate .",
    "guillemin - melrose @xcite studied this problem in the presence of a smooth boundary and considered the dirichlet , neumman , as well as more general robin boundary conditions .",
    "they showed that in all cases @xmath65 where@xmath66 note that in this case the length spectrum @xmath64 contains the lengths of all periodic billiard trajectories hitting the boundary transversally , as well as the lengths of ghost orbits and the boundary itself when trajectories become tangent to the boundary at some point .",
    "hence in a smooth convex planar domain only the lengths of transversal billiard trajectories and the boundary ( and its multiples ) contribute to the length spectrum .",
    "some experts conjecture that the above containment for @xmath67 is in fact an equality , but this has neither been proven nor have any counter - examples been discovered .",
    "the containment is an equality on compact manifolds with negative curvature @xcite .",
    "a polygonal domain is a planar domain whose boundary is a euclidean polygon . in the study of the length spectrum on such domains ,",
    "the terminology polygonal table is often used due to the interpretation of a polygonal domain as the top surface of a billiard table and the identification of geodesic trajectories with billiard trajectories .",
    "propagation of singularities of the wave operator in polygonal tables or in general on manifolds with corners or with conical singularities are more difficult to study because of the diffraction phenomena that takes place at the conical singularities . roughly speaking ,",
    "when a geodesic that carries a singularity of the wave hits a conical singularity , it can reflect in all possible directions .",
    "there is a huge literature on the subject of diffraction , and for the sake of brevity we only list the most relevant ones for our purposes : keller @xcite , sommerfeld @xcite , friedlander @xcite , cheegar - taylor @xcite , melrose - wunsch@xcite .",
    "there has also been a lot of research on the contribution of diffractive geodesics to the wave trace ; see friedlander @xcite , durso @xcite , wunsch @xcite , hillairet @xcite , ford - wunsch @xcite , and more recently hassell - ford - hillairet @xcite . in the physics literature",
    ", we also note the works of bogomolny - pavloff - schmit @xcite and pavloff - schmit @xcite .",
    "a standard technique used in studying the wave trace for polygonal tables is to double the polygon along its edges to obtain a compact _ euclidean surface with conical singularities _ , or escs , as commonly abbreviated in the literature .",
    "a compact @xmath68-dimensional escs is a compact manifold with finitely many conical singularities which is locally isometric to @xmath69 away from the conical points , and near conical points it is isometric to a neighborhood of the vertex of a _",
    "euclidean cone _",
    "@xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a polygon , and let @xmath71 be a copy of @xmath41 , disjoint from @xmath41 , and @xmath72 be the identity map .",
    "we use @xmath73 for @xmath74 where we have identified the points of @xmath75 and @xmath76 under the map @xmath77 .",
    "there is a canonical extension of @xmath77 to an involution @xmath78 .",
    "the surface @xmath73 is smooth everywhere except at the vertices which are isolated conical singularities .",
    "we note that the cone angles are doubled under this procedure , meaning that the cone angle in the surface is twice the interior angle at the corresponding vertex in the polygon .",
    "the laplace operator on the escs arising from the doubled polygon @xmath73 has many self - adjoint extensions .",
    "we shall only consider the friedrichs extension of the laplacian on @xmath73 , which we denote simply by @xmath79 .",
    "it was proved by hillairet @xcite ( and in a more general setting by wunsch @xcite ) that @xmath80to describe @xmath81 precisely , we first need to describe the geodesics on an escs , and to do so we need some definitions .",
    "the conic points are separated into two groups .",
    "a conic point is called _ non - diffractive _ if its angle is equal to @xmath82 for some positive integer @xmath83 , otherwise it is called _",
    "diffractive_. we also use the same terminology for polygons except that non - diffractive angles are of the form @xmath84 . for example , if a trapezoid @xmath61 is not a rectangle , then the top vertex with angle @xmath85 is diffractive , while the bottom two could be either diffractive or non - diffractive , and the top vertex with angle @xmath51 is non - diffractive if and only if @xmath86 .",
    "when a geodesic in a escs hits a non - diffractive conical singularity with cone angle @xmath87 , it continues on a straight line in the cone @xmath88 ( which is isomorphic to @xmath2 ) , as an @xmath83-fold covering space of @xmath89 .",
    "hence if the incoming angle of a geodesic is @xmath90 , its outgoing angle @xmath91 is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the natural covering map .",
    "in contrast , when a geodesic hits a diffractive conic point , it reflects according to _",
    "keller s democratic law of diffraction _ , meaning that it reflects in all possible directions , and we call @xmath94 the _ angle of diffraction_. a geodesic is called diffractive if goes through at least one diffractive singularity ( see figure [ someotherorbits ] ) .",
    "a geodesic _ geometrically diffracts _ at a diffractive conic point with angle @xmath50 if it is the limit of a family of non - diffractive geodesics ( see figure [ h ] ) , which happens when @xmath95 .",
    "all the above are defined similarly on polygons except that geodesics reflect on the edges according to snell s law .",
    "the following wavefront relations hold ( @xcite ) for the integral kernels of the propagators @xmath96 and @xmath97    @xmath98    @xmath99    where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are geodesics flows on @xmath73 and @xmath41 , where geodesics are defined above .",
    "consequently , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are defined to be the lengths of closed geodesics , where geodesics follow the above rules of diffractions .",
    "we note that @xmath104 but they are not necessarily equal .",
    "for example when @xmath41 is a tall trapezoid , an easy observation shows that the length of the orthic triangle ( see figure [ orthic ] ) is in @xmath105 but it is not in @xmath102 .",
    "since the involution @xmath77 commutes with @xmath79 , there is an orthonormal basis ( onb ) consisting of eigenfunctions of both operators , @xmath77 and @xmath79 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath77 are @xmath106 , and hence the joint eigenfunctions of @xmath107 and @xmath79 are even and odd eigenfunctions of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "the even eigenfunctions of @xmath79 correspond to the eigenfunctions of the neumann laplacian on @xmath41 , @xmath108 , and the odd eigenfunctions correspond to the ones of dirichlet laplacian , @xmath109 .",
    "it is now clear that counting multiplicities we have @xmath110 and therefore @xmath111 this in particular shows that @xmath112    again , this inclusion is not an equality because for example the length of the orthic triangle in a tall trapezoid belongs to the singular support of both traces on the right hand side but it does not belong to the singular support of @xmath113 .",
    "in fact what happens in this case is that the singularities of dirichlet and neumann wave traces ( at the length of orthic triangle ) cancel each other on the right hand side of [ dntrace ] ( see proposition [ orthicsingularity ] ) .",
    "[ heattraceneumann ] we point out that a similar relationship holds between the dirichlet and neumann heat traces and the heat trace of @xmath73 as a escs .",
    "more precisely , @xmath114 the asymptotic expansion ( [ heattrace ] ) was proved in @xcite for the dirichlet heat trace . we have not found a reference in literature stating the asymptotic [ heattrace ] for the neumann heat trace , however it follows immediately from the above identity and the asymptotic expansion @xmath115 proved by kokotov ( see theorem 1 of @xcite ) and fursaev @xcite .    .",
    "its linearized poincare map is @xmath116 , hence it is a non - degenerate orbit , and by a result of guillemin - melrose @xcite it contributes a singularity of order @xmath117 to both dirichlet and neumann wave traces if there are no other periodic orbits of the same length with the same order of singularity . ]",
    "a common way to measure the singularity of a tempered distribution is to study the decay and growth properties of its local fourier transform ( smoothed resolvent ) .",
    "the following propositions are crucial to proving our inverse problems for trapezoids .",
    "[ height ] let @xmath61 be a trapezoid that is not a rectangle .",
    "suppose there are no other closed geodesics in @xmath61 of length @xmath9 , or arbitrarily close to @xmath9 , other than the one - parameter family in figure [ h ] .",
    "let @xmath118 be a cutoff function supported near @xmath7 whose support does not contain any lengths in @xmath119 other than @xmath9 . then as @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 , and @xmath123 is the area of the inner rectangle of @xmath61 .",
    "if the conditions of proposition [ height ] are satisfied then @xmath9 and @xmath124 , the area of the inner rectangle of @xmath61 , are spectral invariants .",
    "the above proposition , with @xmath123 replaced by @xmath125 , was proved by hillairet @xcite for the trace of the wave group of @xmath126 .",
    "in fact it was proved in a more general context , namely for escs and for any one - parameter family of regular periodic geodesics whose boundaries are one or two geometrically diffractive geodesics .",
    "hence it immediately applies to the double of the trapezoid in figure [ h ] .",
    "however , recalling ( [ dntrace ] ) , it does not immediately imply anything about the asymptotics of the traces of the wave groups associated to @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
    "we emphasize that hillairet s theorem implies that if both dirichlet and neumann spectrum are known , then @xmath9 and @xmath123 are spectral invariants . we do not wish to make this strong assumption , but we will nonetheless show using the method of reflections and a wavefront calculation that the dirchlet and neumann wave traces have an identical singularity at @xmath7 , showing that indeed proposition [ height ] follows from hillairet s result .",
    "note that this is special for the orbits in figure [ h ] and does not necessarily hold for other orbits .",
    "for example as we will see in proposition [ topedge ] , the orbit in figure [ b ] contributes a singularity at @xmath3 to the trace of the neumann wave group which is larger than the singularity at @xmath3 of the trace of the dirichlet wave group .",
    "[ order ] we note that as @xmath129 we have @xmath130 this is because by the fourier inversion formula @xmath131 however since @xmath132 is rapidly decaying near infinity , and since by the weyl s law the eigenvalues grow linearly in dimension @xmath17 , the trace @xmath133 decays rapidly as @xmath129 .",
    "this together with proposition [ height ] shows that locally near @xmath7 , the wave trace @xmath134 belongs to the sobolev spaces @xmath135 for all @xmath136 but does not belong to @xmath137 , and for this reason we say that @xmath7 is a singularity of order @xmath8 . in general",

    "theorem 2 of @xcite gives the asymptotics for @xmath189 near @xmath3 , which are exactly those given in proposition [ topedge ] .",
    "hence , by corollary [ dntraces ] , to prove this proposition it suffices to show that @xmath217 where @xmath218 if @xmath219 , and @xmath220 when @xmath221 .",
    "we note that in fact @xmath68 corresponds to the number of diffractions because there is no diffraction at the top left vertex when @xmath222 .    to prove the proposition we use theorem 5 of @xcite which gives a parametrix for @xmath182 microlocalized near a diffractive geodesic connecting a point @xmath223 near @xmath224 to a point @xmath225 near @xmath226 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a polygon and @xmath227 be a diffractive geodesic on @xmath73 of length @xmath141 , with initial and terminal points @xmath223 and @xmath225 in @xmath73 , going through @xmath68 diffractions at conic points @xmath228 of angles @xmath229 , with angles of diffractions @xmath230 .",

    "we then reflect @xmath61 about the @xmath254 axis . in particular , this would give a natural neighborhood of the interior of @xmath227 , and the involution map @xmath77 becomes @xmath255 .",

    "our first simple observation is    [ shortest ] the length of any periodic orbit in a trapezoidal table @xmath61 is strictly larger than @xmath9 or @xmath5 unless the orbit is a bouncing ball corresponding to one of the altitudes or it is the bouncing ball between the top two vertices .",
    "we note that any closed diffractive or non - diffractive geodesic in @xmath61 that starts from the top edge ( including the corners ) and is transversal ( i.e. not tangent ) to the top edge must be of length strictly larger than @xmath9 unless it is parallel to the altitude .",

    "moreover , if two non - rectangular trapezoids , with @xmath284 , have the same area @xmath58 , angle invariant @xmath271 , and the same @xmath28 , then they are congruent up to rigid motions .",
    "we now give the proofs of these propositions .",
    "[ proof of proposition [ rectangular ] ] the angle invariant satisfies @xmath285 with equality if and only if the trapezoid is a rectangle .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are isospectral , they have the same angle invariant .",

    "furthermore , by isospectrality , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same area and perimeter , and these uniquely determine a rectangle up to rigid motions .    [ proof of proposition [ waveinvariants ] ] first suppose @xmath286 .",
    "then by proposition [ shortest ] , @xmath287 is the shortest length in @xmath288 and there are no orbits other than the one - parameter family of altitudes having the same length .",
    "hence by proposition [ height ] , both dirichlet and neumann wave traces of @xmath0 have a singularity of order @xmath8 at @xmath289 where up to a constant the leading coefficient equals @xmath290 , the area of the inner rectangle . since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are isospectral , the same must hold for the wave trace of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we must have @xmath291 , and @xmath292 , so that @xmath293 .    if @xmath275 , then again using proposition [ shortest ] , @xmath294 is the shortest length in @xmath288 . by proposition [ topedge ] ,",
    "the neumann wave trace of @xmath0 has a singularity at @xmath295 . if the order of this singularity is @xmath4 , then we know that @xmath276 , and the same type of singularity is found in the neumann wave trace of @xmath1 , thus @xmath277 as well .",
    "furthermore , @xmath296 , and @xmath278 .",
    "similarly , if the order of this singularity is @xmath297 , then we know that there is only one diffraction , meaning that @xmath298 . since the singularity in the wave trace of @xmath1 must be the same , we must have @xmath299 , @xmath296 and @xmath300 .",
    "when @xmath301 , since there are no orbits of length @xmath302 other than @xmath6 and @xmath151 , the singularities of the wave trace at @xmath289 and @xmath295 add .",
    "this is because in fact propositions [ height ] and [ topedge ] are also valid microlocally near their corresponding orbits . in this case since the singularity at @xmath289 is larger , and it contributes to the leading singularity of the wave trace .",
    "hence as in the first case , we have @xmath291 , and @xmath292 , thus @xmath293 .",
    "[ proof of proposition [ 2h ] ] if @xmath58 , @xmath28 , and @xmath282 are known , then obviously @xmath25 can be determined .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear from figure [ trap ] that @xmath303 hence @xmath304 and @xmath305 are spectrally determined . by adding and subtracting these two invariants we arrive at @xmath306 as two spectrally determined quantities . since @xmath307",
    ", we can also determine @xmath308 , which uniquely determines @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",

    "it is more convenient to change the variable by @xmath343 then since @xmath344 , we have @xmath345    then @xmath346 as a function of @xmath347 becomes @xmath348 to show that @xmath349 is increasing on @xmath350 , we prove that @xmath351 on @xmath350 . since @xmath352 , it is clear to see that @xmath353 .",
