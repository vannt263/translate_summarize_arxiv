    "compositeness has been the way of nature .",
    "some of the so called elementary particles of earlier times have turned out to be composites of more elementary ones .",
    "compositeness is one way of getting to a simpler theory involving usually fewer fields or fewer parameters at the fundamental level .",
    "it is also expected to soften the ultraviolet behavior .",
    "composite gauge fields could in addition provide us with an understanding of the gauge principle .",
    "they have received considerable attention in the literature .",
    "the models that are relevant to our purpose are the so called @xmath0 models and their non - abelian generalizations called grassmannian models(gms ) . here",
    "the gauge fields arise as composites of bosonic constituents .",
    "these models have been studied in the large @xmath1 limit and it is found that the non - abelian symmetry is either completely broken or not broken at all . ultimately one would like to construct phenomenological models along these lines , but the phase structure of these models is not very useful for that purpose .",
    "one needs a version in which the gauge symmetry is partially broken .    remarkably , as we will see in this article ,",
    "there does exist a generalization of the gms that allows for partial symmetry breaking .",
    "some of the results of this paper have been briefly reported earlier .",
    "the primary agent of symmetry breaking turns out to be a scalar that too is composite .",
    "this composite higgs scalar arises naturally as a solution of the modified constraint equation . in many of the cases",
    ", it belongs to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the constituent fields in those cases belong to an anomaly free representation .",
    "one may recall here that that the agent of symmetry breaking in grand unified theories is usually a higgs scalar in the adjoint representation .",
    "one may further recall that the fermions in a physical theory belong to an anomaly free representation , and we encounter the same feature here , though in the bosonic version .",
    "two examples are studied to illustrate the approach : one based on the gauge group su(2 ) and the other based on so(10 ) .",
    "the su(2 ) example is the simplest and best suited to illustrate the approach .",
    "here there exists a phase where su(2 ) breaks to a u(1 ) subgroup . the case of so(10 ) studied in some detail is more interesting from the physical point of view .",
    "the phase structure is richer with symmetry breaking to various subgroups such as su(5 ) or su(5)@xmath3u(1 ) .",
    "we also compute the properties of the composite fields , the gauge bosons and the higgs scalars , by doing a derivative expansion of the large @xmath1 effective action .",
    "the expansions available in the literature do not serve our purpose as they are , to our knowledge , also expansions in the higgs scalar .",
    "we hence develop a suitable derivative expansion which we use to compute the kinetic terms and the mass terms for the composites in the various phases .    to start with , in the next section , we review the known models relevant to our work .",
    "first we look at the @xmath0 model that involves a u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "then we discuss its non - abelian generalization , the grassmannian model .",
    "it is based on the gauge group u(@xmath4 ) with the scalars in the fundamental representation . in section [ gen ]",
    ", we introduce our model , a generalization of gm that is capable of accommodating other gauge groups with more general scalar representations . a suitable potential responsible for a rich phase structure",
    "is then introduced . in section [ two ] , we first illustrate our approach with a simple example based on the gauge group su(2 ) and then look at the interesting but more complicated case of so(10 ) .",
    "section [ pro ] discusses the properties of the various composites .",
    "the global symmetry with its breaking patterns and the resulting goldstone modes are discussed in section [ glo ] .",
    "section [ dis ] concludes with a discussion of the present approach .",
    "derivative expansion of the effective potential useful in section [ pro ] is carried out in appendix [ der ] .",
    "the known models that are relevant to our purpose , the @xmath0 and the grassmannian models , are briefly reviewed in this section .",
    "the simplest model is the one that induces a u(1 ) gauge theory , the @xmath0 model .",
    "this is just a field theory involving @xmath5 complex scalar fields , z = ( z_1,z_2,,z_n ) , satisfying the constraint @xmath6 .",
    "the constraint sets their overall scale .",
    "a u(1 ) gauge invariance removes in addition an angular variable .",
    "thus the model is in effect a field theory of @xmath7 complex scalars . for convenience in writing the various results ,",
    "we have above represented the @xmath8 s collectively as a row vector @xmath9 . in this notation ,",
    "the constraint can be rewritten as @xmath10 .",
    "the lagrangian is",
    "l = n. here @xmath11 is the inverse of a coupling constant .",
    "an overall multiplicative factor @xmath1 is introduced for later convenience in the @xmath12 expansion .",
    "it is easy to verify the existence of a @xmath13 gauge invariance under which each of the @xmath8 s transform with the same phase . in the vector notation",
    ", this is simply @xmath14 where the phase @xmath15 is space - time dependent .",
    "the constraint is clearly invariant under this symmetry . to see that it is a gauge symmetry , note first that the combination @xmath16 transforms as a u(1 ) gauge field , iz_z^iz_z^+ _ .",
    "the last term actually has a @xmath17 but that drops out due to the constraint .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge invariance will be more explicit , if we rewrite the lagrangian by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath18 as follows : l = n(_z_z^- 2ia_z_z^+ a_^2 ) = n. here @xmath19 is the covariant derivative @xmath20 . in this form ,",
    "the gauge symmetry is manifest .",
    "as shown in section [ pro ] , the auxiliary field @xmath21 that transforms as a @xmath13 gauge field becomes dynamical and hence a genuine gauge field after quantum corrections in the large @xmath1 approximation .",
    "it is a composite gauge field made of the @xmath9 fields .",
    "thus the model under consideration can be viewed as an induced @xmath13 gauge theory or a theory of composite gauge fields .",
    "this model is a special case of the grassmannian model ; hence we study its phase structure below as a special case of gm .",
    "the grassmannian model is a generalization of the @xmath0 model that induces a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "we now have more fields , a set of them , represented collectively by a @xmath22 matrix @xmath9 with the elements @xmath23 , @xmath24 labeling the rows and @xmath25 labeling the columns .",
    "the column index @xmath25 is an internal index or a flavor index that is essentially carried over from our previous model .",
    "the new index @xmath24 , the row index , is the gauge index associated with a non - abelian symmetry which in the present case is u(@xmath4 ) .",
    "all our results should reduce to those of the previous model for the case of @xmath26 .",
    "the constraint is now zz^= i_m , where @xmath27 is an identity matrix of order @xmath4 .",
    "the present lagrangian is of the previous form , but now as such it will be an @xmath28 matrix and hence needs an overall trace to make it a number , l = ntr .",
    "it is again easy to verify that there is a u@xmath29 gauge invariance with respect to the index @xmath24 . under this gauge symmetry",
    ", @xmath9 transforms as a set of @xmath1 fundamental representations . in the matrix notation , this transformation is simply @xmath30 , @xmath31 being an @xmath28 space - time dependent unitary matrix representing the gauge transformation .",
    "this transformation does not affect the @xmath25 index which labels @xmath1 fundamental representations .",
    "the constraint respects this symmetry .",
    "the object @xmath18 is in the adjoint representation of u(@xmath32 and transforms as a gauge field thanks to the constraint , a_ua_u^+ iu_u^. the role of the constraint here is to simplify the last term above from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the gauge symmetry becomes explicit when we rewrite the lagrangian as in eq . with an overall trace , l = ntr .",
    "@xmath19 being the covariant derivative @xmath20 . as before",
    ", @xmath21 appears as an auxiliary field but , as can be seen at large @xmath1 , it becomes dynamical and hence a genuine gauge field after quantum corrections .",
    "it is a composite gauge field with the @xmath9 fields as constituents .",
    "the constraint and the @xmath35 gauge invariance have the effect of suppressing @xmath36 degrees of freedom .",
    "the theory is thus based effectively on @xmath37 scalars . clearly , for it to be a sensible one ,",
    "@xmath1 is required to exceed @xmath4 .",
    "the constraint @xmath38 can be incorporated into the lagrangian with the help of a lagrangian multiplier @xmath39 , a @xmath28 matrix .",
    "the result is l = ntr . to understand symmetry breaking , and hence to identify the various phases , we need to obtain the effective potential .",
    "we will do this at large @xmath1 . because @xmath21 is not expected to pick up any expectation value",
    ", we will set it to zero . the classical contribution to",
    "the effective potential comes from the lagrangian by dropping the derivative terms . because @xmath12 appears in the lagrangian like the planck s constant , the quantum corrections to this contribution",
    "is expected to be suppressed by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "but there are @xmath1 fundamental representations contributing equally and this can offset the @xmath12 suppression .",
    "the result is that at large @xmath1 the effective potential for the @xmath9 and @xmath39 fields obtained by integrating away the @xmath9 fluctuations carries a correction n  ln(k^2i_m+ ) . here and in the rest of this article",
    ", we suppress the dependence of the momentum integrals on a cutoff @xmath40 .",
    "the total effective potential is thus v_eff = ntr(zz^- ) + n  ln(k^2i_m+ ) .    to determine the various phases , we need to extremize this potential .",
    "the resulting saddle point equations ( spes ) are @xmath41 obtained by varying @xmath42 and ( zz^-i_m ) + = 0 coming from varying @xmath39 .",
    "now , let us look for solutions of the form ",
    "= ( .i_p&0 + 0&0 ) , zz^= ( 0&0 + 0&v^2.i_m - p ) , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two identity matrices of order @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath47 is zero with this ansatz .",
    "solutions for @xmath9 that satisfy @xmath41 can easily be constructed .",
    "leads to two equations , one in the @xmath43 sector and the other in the @xmath44 sector , -+ & = & 0 , ( v^2 - 1 ) + & = & 0 .",
    "for @xmath48 there is no @xmath43 sector and hence the first equation above would be absent .",
    "similarly for @xmath49 the second would be absent .",
    "let us first show that @xmath45 can not lie in between .",
    "we will do this by showing that the two equations can not be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "firt note that @xmath50 should not be negative for the momentum integral involving it to be well - defined .",
    "hence , from the first equation , we note that @xmath11 has an upper limit @xmath51 given by _",
    "c = = ^216 ^ 2 .",
    "but the second equation implies that @xmath51 is also a lower limit of @xmath11 . to see this , rewrite it as @xmath52 and note that @xmath53 can not be negative .",
    "it thus follows that , except at the critical point @xmath54 where the question is irrelevant , @xmath45 is either zero or @xmath4 .",
    "thus we have two phases .",
    "for @xmath55 , we have the broken phase ( @xmath48 ) where @xmath17 has an expectation value . the solution for @xmath9",
    "has an expectation value along all the `` directions '' in the fundamental representation .",
    "this breaks @xmath35 completely and all the gauge bosons are massive . for @xmath56",
    ", we have the unbroken phase ( @xmath49 ) where the gauge symmetry is unbroken and the gauge bosons are massless .",
    "@xmath54 is a critical point .",
    "in fact , @xmath57 is a critical line along which all the masses vanish .    in other words ,",
    "the gauge group is either completely broken or not broken at all .",
    "there are apparently no phases , at least at large @xmath1 , where a partial breaking of the gauge group is possible . to obtain a richer phase structure ,",
    "we invoke a generalization of these models and study them at large @xmath1 in the following section .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the grassmannian model involves scalars in @xmath1 fundamental representations of the gauge group u(@xmath4 ) .",
    "a natural extension is to construct models for various gauge groups with the scalars transforming under different representations . to our knowledge , they have not been studied in the literature . in this section ,",
    "we explore an interesting class of these models that are nontrivial generalizations offering a rich phase structure . as usual",
    ", we are concerned with symmetry breaking at large @xmath1 .",
    "one approach , a straightforward one , is to choose some other gauge group @xmath58 in place of u(@xmath4 ) but to leave the constraint @xmath38 unchanged .",
    "in other words , we take the @xmath9 fields to belong to an arbitrary representation @xmath59 of dimension @xmath4 and multiplicity @xmath1 of some chosen gauge group @xmath58",
    ". we may still represent the @xmath9 fields in the form of an @xmath22 matrix .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath31 is now in @xmath59 acting on the matrix @xmath9 as before , @xmath30 .",
    "the lagrangian is still of the form we came across earlier in eq . , but with the auxiliary gauge field @xmath21 now taking values in the lie algebra of @xmath58 . an expression for the auxiliary field and the form of the lagrangian involving the @xmath9 fields alone can be easily derived .",
    "they are given respectively by the eqs . and given below .",
    "however , symmetry breaking at large @xmath1 remains the same .",
    "this is because the gauge fields are set to zero in our discussion of the phase structure .",
    "a more interesting generalization occurs when the constraint is modified as well .",
    "again , we take the @xmath9 fields to be in any representation @xmath59 of dimension @xmath4 and multiplicity @xmath1 of a gauge group @xmath58 .",
    "we look for a lagrangian that resembles .",
    "it is clearly gauge invariant with the auxiliary gauge field @xmath21 transforming as in .",
    "note that the part of the lagrangian quadratic in @xmath60 is proportional to a_^aa_^btr(t_at_bzz^)=a_^aa_^btr(t_abzz^ ) , where @xmath61 s are the generators of the gauge group @xmath58 and @xmath62 .",
    "earlier in the gm , the constraint @xmath38 was responsible for rendering it quadratic in @xmath21 alone .",
    "this resulted in a well defined expression for the auxiliary field @xmath21 as a composite of the @xmath9 fields .",
    "now , more generally , we achieve the same goal by imposing the following constraint instead : ( t_abzz^ ) = l_ab . here",
    "@xmath63 is the dynkin index of the representation @xmath59 defined by @xmath64 .",
    "note that this new constraint also respects the gauge symmetry . using it ,",
    "it is easy to obtain the following expression for the auxiliary field : a_^a = i2ltr . later in section [ pro ] , we observe that this field becomes dynamical at large @xmath1 and is justly called a composite gauge field constructed out of the @xmath9 s .",
    "an expression for the lagrangian in terms of the @xmath9 fields alone can now be obtained , l = ntr(_z_z^ ) + 14ln\\{tr}^2 .",
    "this derivation should ensure gauge invariance and this is easily seen to be the case . incorporating the constraint into the lagrangian using a lagrange multiplier @xmath65 leads to an expression that agrees with .",
    "the symmetry breaking effects could be potentially different since the matrix @xmath39 is not an arbitrary one any more .",
    "first , we make sure that the constraint is different from the earlier one @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath38 clearly is a solution of .",
    "fortunately , there are cases where this is not the only solution .",
    "the new constraint is in some cases weaker than the earlier one . to see this ,",
    "introduce a hermitian matrix @xmath66 by @xmath67 and observe that the new constraint is equivalent to looking for a solution of @xmath68 . given a @xmath66 that leads to a positive semidefinite @xmath17",
    ", @xmath9 is solvable generally as @xmath69 for some @xmath70 obeying @xmath71 .",
    "the earlier constraint corresponds to the trivial solution @xmath72 . that there exist",
    "cases where @xmath66 is nontrivial can be seen as follows .",
    "make the ansatz that @xmath66 is in the lie algebra itself , that is @xmath73 .",
    "now , the constraint @xmath68 simply states that the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly associated with the representation @xmath59 should vanish . that there exist anomaly free representations",
    "is well known .",
    "a simple example is the doublet of the gauge group su(2 ) that yields a triplet for @xmath66 .",
    "we will use this example later to illustrate our approach .",
    "a more interesting example is the spinor representation 16 of the gauge group so(10 ) that is well known to anomaly free .",
    "the ansatz gives a solution for @xmath66 that is in the adjoint representation 45 .",
    "this is interesting , for it is known that an adjoint scalar is a promising candidate to break a grand unified theory based on so(10 ) .",
    "its appearance here is quite unexpected .    in some instances , the above ansatz gives the most general solution .",
    "this is the case with both the examples mentioned above .",
    "this can be seen from representation theory .",
    "regard @xmath66 as belonging to the product representations @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the su(2 ) and so(10 ) examples respectively .",
    "the component representations in these decompositions should separately obey the constraint .",
    "the singlet appearing in both the cases is ruled out easily .",
    "this is because the singlet component being proportional to identity gives @xmath76 violating the constraint . in the case of so(10 ) , we need to exclude the 210 as well .",
    "it is easily observed that there exist @xmath77 traceless hermitian matrices violating the constraint .",
    "this excludes 210 because such matrices can only have components along the 45 and 210 , and the 45 alone can not violate the constraint . it is not to be deduced , however , that the ansatz always gives the most general solution .",
    "for instance , if one were to pick a sufficiently large representation of the gauge group for @xmath59 , one will easily end up with more representations that remain unsuppressed in @xmath66 .",
    "but , representation theory should still be applicable to solve for @xmath66 in general .",
    "let us call the models as type one models when @xmath66 solves identically to zero and our new constraint reduces to the old one .",
    "they are closer to the grassmannian models discussed earlier , or rather to their generalizations mentioned in the beginning of this section involving subgroups of u(@xmath4 ) .",
    "the other models where @xmath66 can be nontrivial is referred to as type two models .",
    "models based on a reducible @xmath59 are quite generally of type two .",
    "this is because the constraint does not determine some components of @xmath66 , for instance those connecting different subrepresentations in @xmath59 .",
    "note , however , that a reducible @xmath59 arising from an irreducible one repeated say @xmath78 times , though appears to be of type two , can be recast as of type one by combining @xmath78 and @xmath1 to an overall multiplicity @xmath79 in place of @xmath1 .",
    "we prefer to view them as type one models with multiplicity @xmath79 .",
    "type one models are thus necessarily based on irreducible @xmath59 s .",
    "the effective potential at large @xmath1 is again of the form encountered earlier .",
    "the spes governing the phases are @xmath41 obtained by varying @xmath42 and + ( t_ab1k^2i_m+ ) = 0 obtained by varying @xmath39 . for type one models , the traces can be dropped and the equation becomes equivalent to the one we had earlier for gm ( see eq . ) .",
    "solutions can be sought in the same manner .",
    "the phase structure is governed by a critical @xmath11 given by eq . .",
    "it is ensured that the ansatz for @xmath39 one makes in solving these equations is consistent with its definition @xmath65 .",
    "this is because the final conclusion involves either the broken phase @xmath80 ( for @xmath55 ) or the unbroken phase @xmath81 ( for @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath82 or @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the second casimir invariant of the irreducible representation @xmath59 defined by @xmath85 , and is acceptable .    for type two models ,",
    "the above equation can still be reduced to that of gm , eq . , but with a matrix @xmath66 satisfying @xmath86 on the r.h.s , ( zz^-i_m ) + = w. the factor @xmath11 on the r.h.s makes this equation agree with @xmath67 at the level of expectation values .",
    "again , the solutions @xmath80 ( for @xmath55 ) and @xmath81 ( for @xmath56 ) will satisfy this equation , for @xmath66 can clearly be chosen zero .",
    "as before , @xmath81 is acceptable for irreducible @xmath59 s as it follows from @xmath83 . in the case of reducible @xmath59 s , that is @xmath87 where each @xmath88 is irreducible ,",
    "the solution for @xmath56 is a bit more involved .",
    "try again the ansatz @xmath89 . in this case",
    "@xmath39 is not proportional to identity .",
    "instead , it is a diagonal matrix taking values @xmath90 along each representation @xmath88 .",
    "we look for a @xmath66 matrix that is also diagonal , with values @xmath91 along @xmath88 .",
    "note that the constraint @xmath68 requires the @xmath91 s to satisfy @xmath92 where the @xmath93 s are the indices of the representations @xmath88 s .",
    "the spe along @xmath88 is -+ = w_i .",
    "the constraint on the @xmath91 s gives -_il_i + _ il_i = 0 .",
    "this determines @xmath50 .",
    "individual equations simply determine the various @xmath91 s .",
    "that this solution holds only for @xmath56 is easy to note .",
    "the solutions obtained so far are not a priori the most general ones .",
    "there could be more solutions . this does not , however , appear to be the case with the examples mentioned earlier based on the gauge groups su(2 ) or so(10 ) ( see eqs . and and the discussions following them ) .",
    "analogous situation occurs for the gauge group @xmath94 with its representation 27 .",
    "this is perhaps illustrative of a generic phenomenon or suggestive of the need to look at larger representations that might lead to more solutions .",
    "we do not wish to go into those details here , rather we find it more rewarding to consider the other possibility , that of adding a potential .      the unexpected appearance of an adjoint scalar @xmath66",
    "apparently did nt help us in a partial breaking of the gauge group .",
    "the situation changes drastically when a potential is introduced leading to a rich phase structure .",
    "the adjoint scalar , that has not played any significant role so far , plays a major one in the presence of a potential .",
    "note that there is no simple way to incorporate a potential in the canonical gm without spoiling the global symmetries or the constraint equation .",
    "but , interestingly , the generalized models of the previous section , governed by the gauge invariant lagrangian of eq . constructed with scalars alone , do allow for potential terms .",
    "as we will see , the presence of a potential leads to drastically different conclusions .",
    "these models with such phase structures are relevant in model building .",
    "let us keep the potential quite general to begin with , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is an ordinary function of its argument , a polynomial for instance .",
    "this is expected to be a nontrivial extension of type two models unlike the case of type one models in which the constraint @xmath38 reduces this to the addition of a constant .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a composite field variable @xmath97 for @xmath17 and write the potential as @xmath98 .",
    "the requirement @xmath99 can be incorporated with the help of a lagrange multiplier @xmath100 , adding a term @xmath101 to the potential .",
    "as before , constraint can be accommodated with the help of a lagrange multiplier @xmath65 .",
    "its effect is , as we know , to add a term @xmath102 to the potential . after translating @xmath100 to @xmath103 for convenience , the total lagrangian looks like l = ntr .",
    "the large @xmath1 effective potential is now computable , v_eff = ntr+ n  ln(k^2i_m+y ) .",
    "the spes are obtained by extremizing this potential .",
    "varying @xmath97 determines @xmath100 to be @xmath104 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument .",
    "varying @xmath39 gives @xmath105=0 $ ] .",
    "as before , one may look for a solution of this in the form @xmath106 where @xmath66 satisfies @xmath68 . varying @xmath100 and using these solutions yields ( zz^-i_m ) + = w. this is to be supplemented with @xmath107z=0 $ ] obtained by varying @xmath42 .",
    "this system of equations resembles the ones obtained earlier ( see eq . ) , with @xmath39 replaced by @xmath108 .",
    "the presence of @xmath109 , however , is suggestive of a different phase structure .    for type one models @xmath72 , and",
    "@xmath109 just adds a constant to @xmath39 .",
    "this can be absorbed into @xmath39 because these models , being based on an irreducible @xmath59 , allow for the addition of term proportional to identity to @xmath39 . as expected in the beginning of this section , this is a trivial extension .",
    "however , this is not the case for type two models and we expect a rich phase structure .",
    "an example we will use later is a potential of sixth degree in @xmath9 and @xmath110 that leads to @xmath111 for some constants @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . for a model based on an irreducible @xmath59",
    ", the term @xmath115 can be absorbed into @xmath39 as we have already noted .",
    "when @xmath66 is in the adjoint representation , the term @xmath116 can also be absorbed into @xmath39 . as a result , the spes to be solved are ( zz^-i_m ) + = w , and @xmath117z=0 $ ] .",
    "these equations are difficult to handle analytically and we present our numerical results for su(2 ) and so(10 ) below . we find that they do have solutions for a range of parameters when @xmath56 and @xmath118 .    given all such solutions for @xmath56 , the next step is to determine those that are preferred energetically .",
    "the gm solutions of section [ kno ] leave the gauge group unbroken for @xmath56 whereas those found here break it at least partially .",
    "which one is preferred is of course determined by the effective potential . in other words",
    ", one needs to compute @xmath119 for all the solutions and pick the one ( or more ) that has the the lowest value .",
    "we do this along a chosen path in the parameter space of @xmath11 and @xmath113 that crosses all the phases .",
    "we find that some of the new solutions end up always having the lowest potential .",
    "in other words , for a range of parameters , a partial breaking of the gauge group is preferred over the unbroken case .",
    "details are presented in the next section . the following expression for the effective potential at a saddle point ( sp )",
    "is used to this end : v_eff(sp ) = -ntr(+bw^2/2 ) + n  ln(k^2i_m++bw ) .",

    "there exist regions of the parameter space where su(2 ) breaks down to u(1 ) . in the case of so(10 ) , symmetry breaking to su(5 ) or to su(5)@xmath3u(1 ) or perhaps to some other subgroups is possible .",
    "these examples help realize our goal of constructing an induced gauge theory with composite gauge bosons having partial symmetry breaking .",
    "we have computed the properties of the composite fields , the gauge bosons and the higgs scalars , by doing a derivative expansion of the large @xmath1 effective action .",
    "because we need an expansion that does not perturb the higgs field , we can not utilize the canonical expansions available in the literature .",
    "we have developed a suitable derivative expansion in the appendix and have used it to compute the kinetic terms and the mass terms for the composites in the various phases .",
    "we have not addressed the issue of renormalizability of grassmannian models or our generalized ones .",
    "it is interesting to note that the theory at large @xmath1 exhibits a critical point which extends to a critical line in the presence of a potential .",
    "it is known that the critical points or lines can , and in many cases do , soften the ultraviolet behavior .",
    "this softening is probably not sufficient enough to help renormalize the theory in four dimensions and one may have to include other relevant operators in the lagrangian . in this connection",
    ", we note that certain four dimensional grassmannian models of composite gauge fields have been studied on the lattice and shown to be renormalizable .",
    "their phase structures and their relation to continuum theories remain unexplored .",

    ". adding the two results , 2dd= -^21 + td^2  . putting these together , we have a_1 = 1t^21= 12 ^ 2= -12d  . which is the result quoted earlier .",
    "the second step follows from the sum of ^21&= & t_1 ^ 2 ^21&= & 1 ^ 2= ( t - t_1)^2 .",
    "the next coefficient @xmath235 can be computed along similar lines .",
