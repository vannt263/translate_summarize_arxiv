    "at high energies / small bjorken - x , qcd predicts that gluons in a hadron wavefunction form a new state , the so - called color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite , for a review see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the cornerstone of the cgc is the existence of a hard saturation scale @xmath4 at which nonlinear gluon recombination effects become important and start to balance gluon radiation .",
    "the color glass condensate ( saturation ) approach to qcd at high energy has been very successful to describe a variety of processes at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of saturation effects is still disputable given that other approaches offered alternative descriptions . in order to test saturation physics and its relevance",
    ", it seems therefore essential to consider various reactions in different kinematic regions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and future collider experiments .",
    "here , we address the role of gluon saturation at lhc energy @xmath5 tev in hadrons and direct photon production in @xmath6 collisions within the light - cone color - dipole approach using various saturation models .",
    "details of calculations can be found in ref .",
    "the concept of saturation and the taming of the power - like rise of the gluon distribution at small bjorken - x was first addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the double logarithmic approximation .",
    "the actual calculation of higher - order corrections to the non - linear small - x evolution equations still remains as a challenge @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "thus , one may resort to a qcd - like model which incorporates the basic features of gluon saturation into the dipole - proton forward scattering amplitude , and provides predictions which will allow to test the validity of the treatment .",
    "there are several parametrizations proposed in the literature which all give a good description of hera data but predict different saturation scales , see fig .",
    "[ f : sat ] .",
    "the details of saturation models used in fig .",
    "[ f : sat ] can be found in ref .",
    ". the main feature of these models is that for decreasing @xmath7 , the dipole amplitude saturates at smaller dipole sizes .",
    "note that there is no unique definition for the saturation scale in literature .",
    "we define the saturation scale @xmath8 as a energy scale at which the @xmath9 dipole scattering amplitude @xmath10 becomes sizable @xcite .     for various color - dipole models labeled with cgc @xcite , gbw @xcite , klr - ads / cft @xcite and aams - bk1 @xcite .",

    "the invariant cross - section of hadron and direct photon production can be calculated via the light - cone color - dipole factorization scheme @xcite , see also ref .",

    "[ lhc - e1 ] , the differential cross - section of pion @xmath13 and direct photon @xmath14 ( photons radiated in hadronic collisions not via hadronic decays ) production at lhc are plotted versus rapidity at fixed transverse momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 gev within various color - dipole models ( see fig .  [",
    "f : sat ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the discrepancies among various saturation color dipole model results can be about a factor of @xmath1 at moderate rapidities . at the kinematic limit , i.e. at very forward rapidities and higher @xmath17 where the differential cross - section approaches zero , kinematic constraints limit the parton phase space and saturation effects become less important . it is seen from fig .  [ lhc - e1 ] that for both hadron and photon production , away from the kinematic limit , at not very large @xmath18 and @xmath17 , a color - dipole model with larger saturation scale leads to a stronger peak at forward rapidity ( having in mind that the saturation scale is a dynamical function of @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "[ f : sat ] ) .    in order to understand the _ relative _ importance of saturation effects at various rapidities",
    ", we employ the semi - sat model fitted to hera data with the dipole - proton forward scattering amplitude @xcite : @xmath19^{\\frac{1}{2\\gamma_s}}. \\label{nos}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath20 is defined for @xmath21 as @xmath22 , and for @xmath23 as @xmath24",
    ". the value of other parameters of this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the fit obtained with such an oversimplified model is as good as for the other models with @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ lhc - s1 ] we show , ratio of the two cross - sections for both pions and direct photon at lhc , calculated once with diffusion term and once without , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen that at forward rapidities , the diffusion term in the anomalous dimension is not important , since it gives similar results as with a fixed @xmath26 .",
    "the preferred value of anomalous dimension @xmath27 at very forward rapidities is close to the one predicted from the bk equation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the saturation effects start being essential when the anomalous dimension reaches the value @xmath28 which is the case for forward rapidities ( see refs .",
    "this indicates that direct photon and hadron production at different rapidities at lhc are rather sensitive to saturation .",

    "[ lhc - s1 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=6 ]    direct photons can only be radiated from quarks , while hadrons can be produced by both gluons and quarks . at the lhc energy at midrapidity gluons",
    "therefore the photon / pion ratio is significantly reduced toward midrapidity . however , at very forward rapidity , valence quarks become important and the photon / pion ratio rises . moreover , at high @xmath17 again valence quarks becomes important and we have a sharp rise of the photon / pion ratio . in fig .",
    "[ lhc - s1 ] right panel , we show the photon / pion ratio @xmath29 as a function of @xmath17 at various rapidities within the gbw model and @xmath6 collisions",
    ". the ratio @xmath29 can be as big as @xmath30 at very forward rapidities @xmath31 at lhc energy .",
    "therefore , direct photon production extends to higher rapidities for a fixed @xmath17 , see figs .",
    "[ lhc - s1 ] .",
    "note that suppression of hadrons at very forward rapidity also ensures significant suppression of radiative decays of those hadrons .",
    "therefore , measurements of direct photons at forward rapidities should be rather clean , as the background from radiative hadronic decays is significantly suppressed .",
