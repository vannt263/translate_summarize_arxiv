    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) is the deepest optical survey that has been made to date , enabling a detailed study of the galaxy redshift distribution ( e.g. , gwyn & hartwick 1996 ) and the global star formation history ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the hdf covers an area of 4.3 arcmin@xmath6 , with a pixel scale of @xmath7 , and has 5 @xmath8 point source detection thresholds of 26.7 , 28.8 , 30.1 , and 30.3 mag measured in the space telescope magnitude system in f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w filters , respectively ( e.g. , clements & couch 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", we use ab magnitudes ; in this system , the magnitudes of the detection thresholds are , respectively , 28.0 , 29.2 , 29.9 , and 29.5 mag .",
    "complete observational and data reduction details of the hdf are given by williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts exist for nearly 180 galaxies in the hdf .",
    "these redshifts are now complemented by two photometric redshift catalogs , one based on spectral template fitting ( sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; hereafter sly ) , and the other on empirical color - redshift relations ( wang , bahcall , & turner 1998 ; hereafter wbt ) .",
    "here we use the magnitudes for hdf sources derived by sly and the redshifts derived by sly and wbt .",
    "galaxies in the hdf have redshifts which are estimated to range from 0.1 to 5 , with a large portion having redshifts between 2 and 4 .",
    "such galaxies have a significant probability of being strongly lensed .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has proven to be invaluable to gravitational lens discovery programs because of the high resolution images it produces ( e.g. , ratnatunga et al .",
    "the combination of high resolution and deep exposures in multiple colors provides a rich ground for gravitational lens searches , and it was expected that hdf would contain between 3 to 10 lensed galaxies , based on the number of lensed quasars and radio sources in other surveys ( hogg et al .",
    "1996 ) .    instead , a careful analysis of the hdf ( e.g. , zepf et al .",
    "1997 ) has revealed a surprising dearth of candidates for lensed sources .",
    "in fact , the best estimate is either 0 or 1 lensed sources in the entire field , although very faint images with small angular separations may have escaped current analyses .",
    "this lack of lensing has led to suggestions ( e.g. , zepf et al . 1997 ) that the hdf data may be incompatible with the high probability of lensing expected in a universe with a large cosmological constant .    here , we calculate the expected number of detectable , multiply - imaged galaxies in the hdf for different cosmological parameters , and we constrain these parameters by comparing the expectations with the observations . in   2",
    "we discuss our calculation and its inputs , including the inferred redshifts of the galaxies and the luminosity distribution of potential lenses . in ",
    "3 we present our resulting constraints on cosmological parameters , and in particular on @xmath9 . in   4 we discuss the potential effect of systematic errors on the expected and observed number of lensed galaxies .",
    "finally in   5",
    "we summarize and discuss future prospects for tighter constraints .",
    "we follow the conventions that the hubble constant , @xmath10 , is 100@xmath11  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , the present mean density in the universe in units of the closure density is @xmath2 , and the present normalized cosmological constant is @xmath3 . in a flat universe , @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we describe our calculation of the expected number of lensed galaxies in the hdf . in   2.1 we discuss the formalism for the calculation , and in   2.2 we consider input quantities and their errors , such as the photometric redshifts and the luminosity distribution of potential lenses .",
    "in order to calculate the number of lensed galaxies in the hdf , we model the lensing galaxies as singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) and use the analytical filled - beam approximation ( e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ) . at redshifts",
    "@xmath13 , the analytical filled - beam calculations in fukugita et al . (",
    "1992 ) agree to better than 2% with numerical calculations ( e.g. , fig .  1 in holz , miller , & quashnock 1999 ) .    to calculate the probability of observing strong lensing , two additional effects must be included .",
    "first , any magnitude - limited sample such as the hdf is subject to so - called  magnification bias \" ( e.g. , kochanek 1991 ) , in which the number of lensed sources in the sample is larger than it would be in an unbiased sample , because lensing brightens into the sample sources that would otherwise not be detected .",
    "this is a particularly pronounced effect in quasar lensing surveys ( e.g. , maoz & rix 1993 ) , because the faint end of the quasar luminosity function rises steeply .",
    "second , because identification of a lensed source requires the detection of at least two of its multiple images , then if the second brightest of the images is too faint to detect , such sources will not be identified as strongly lensed . for lens - search surveys such as the hst snapshot survey of bright quasars ( bahcall et al .",
    "1992 ) , this effect is small , because the depth of the pointed search is much greater than the depth of the initial search , and hence almost all secondary images will be detected . in the case of the hdf , it is not possible to do a deeper follow - up , and hence for a significant fraction of sources , especially those near the limiting magnitude of the survey , it will be difficult to detect other lensed companions .",
    "if the probability for a source at redshift @xmath14 to be strongly lensed is @xmath15 , and the number of unlensed sources in the hdf between rest - frame luminosity @xmath16 and @xmath17 and between redshifts @xmath14 and @xmath18 is @xmath19 , then the number of lensed sources , @xmath20 , in that luminosity and redshift interval expected in the hdf is ( see also maoz et al.1992 )    @xmath21f(a , l , z)q(a)\\,da\\ ] ]    where the integral is over all allowed values of @xmath22 , the amplification of the brightest lensed image compared to the unlensed brightness , @xmath23 is the probability distribution of amplifications , and @xmath24 is the probability of observing the second - brightest image given @xmath22 , @xmath16 , and @xmath14 .",
    "our assumption that the lenses are singular isothermal spheres implies that the minimum amplification is @xmath25 and the probability distribution is @xmath26 . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath24 is a step function ( @xmath27 ) , so that a dimmer image with apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath28 is detected , whereas one dimmer than @xmath28 is not detected .",
    "this assumption means that    @xmath29\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the apparent magnitude of the brighter image and @xmath31 is the ratio of the brightness of the primary image to the brightness of the secondary image in the sis approximation .",
    "we assume that the brightness distribution of galaxies at any given redshift is described by a schechter function , in which the comoving density of galaxies at redshift @xmath14 and with luminosity between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is    @xmath32^{\\alpha(z ) } e^{-l / l^*(z)}\\ , dl\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where , as before , both @xmath16 and @xmath33 are measured in the rest frame of the galaxy .",
    "thus , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the comoving volume in the solid angle of the hdf . we can then write the expected number @xmath36 of lensed galaxies in our selected subsample of the hdf as    @xmath37 { 2\\over{(a-1)^3}}da\\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv \\sum_i \\tau(z_i ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the sum is over each of the galaxies in our sample , where we have chosen only those galaxies in the hdf with i magnitudes brighter than 27 .",
    "the index @xmath38 represents each galaxy ; hence , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath30 are , respectively , the redshift , rest - frame luminosity , and apparent i magnitude of the @xmath38th galaxy .",
    "the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath30 can be measured with relatively little error , but the rest - frame luminosities @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 are more difficult to infer because their value depends on uncertain k - corrections . therefore , we estimate the total average bias by summing the expectation values of @xmath42 , which are computed by weighting the integral in equation ( 4 ) by a normalized distribution of luminosities @xmath40 drawn from the schechter function appropriate for the redshift @xmath39 of galaxy @xmath38 , instead of using inferred rest - frame luminosities that are , in any case , very uncertain .",
    "we used the tabulated values for schechter luminosity function in sly , and calculated the magnification bias for individual redshift intervals for which the schechter function parameters are available in table 1 of sly . in principle",
    ", the uncertainties in the schechter function parameters at a given redshift can affect the calculation of the bias , but in practice only the uncertainty in the power - law slope @xmath43 has a significant effect ; in ",
    "3.2 we calculate the result of varying @xmath43 by the quoted errors for source galaxies with redshifts between 2 and 3 , which dominate the expected incidence of lensing .",
    "_ redshifts of galaxies_we have used two available photometric redshift catalogs for galaxies in the hdf : sly used spectral fitting techniques to calculate the redshift for all galaxies that appeared in the four hdf passbands with a i - band limiting magnitude of 27 .",
    "there are 848 such galaxies , 181 of which have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "recently , wbt computed photometric redshifts for the same sample as sly , based on empirical relations which were calibrated against spectroscopic redshifts . in figure  1 , we show the redshift distribution of the hdf galaxies according to the sly ( left panel ) and wbt ( right panel ) catalogs , as a function of the i - band magnitude .",
    "these distributions are similar to that found by gwyn & hartwick ( 1996 ) , and contain two peaks , with one at @xmath44 and the other at @xmath45 2.3 . compared to the spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "the photometric redshifts of sly have a larger scatter than the redshifts of wbt .",
    "however , as is clear from fig .  1",
    ", there is a pronounced ( and most probably spurious ) lack of photometric redshifts between 1.5 and 2.2 in the wbt catalog , in the same redshift range where no spectroscopic redshifts are currently available for the hdf .",
    "this gap is much less dramatic in the sly catalog .",
    "it is therefore uncertain which catalog is more reliable overall .",
    "we therefore estimate cosmological constraints based on both catalogs , but we find ( see   3 ) that the derived constraints are almost the same for either catalog .",
    "_ properties of lensing galaxies_the overall probability of strong lensing depends on the number density and typical mass of lensing galaxies . for singular isothermal spheres , with comoving number density @xmath46 and velocity dispersion @xmath8 , this factor is given by the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is independent of the hubble constant , because the observationally inferred number density is itself proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "note that the probability of lensing , @xmath15 , is directly proportional to @xmath49 .    at any given redshift , we can estimate @xmath49 directly from the galaxy luminosity function at that redshift , if we know the dependence of the velocity dispersion on the luminosity .",
    "a commonly assumed functional form is @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 . kochanek ( 1996 )",
    "estimates @xmath53 and adopts a velocity dispersion for an @xmath33 galaxy in the local universe of @xmath54 km s@xmath12 . if the luminosity function at redshift @xmath14 is given by equation ( 3 ) , then with the normalization for the velocity dispersion given by kochanek ( 1996 ) , we find , by integrating equation ( 5 ) over the luminosity function at redshift @xmath14 , that    @xmath55^{\\frac{4}{\\gamma } } \\phi^*(z)\\gamma\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{4}{\\gamma}+1\\right)\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the normal gamma function .",
    "we assume that the luminosity at which @xmath57 km s@xmath12 , corresponds to a b magnitude of @xmath58 .",
    "henceforth , we will also assume @xmath59 .",
    "to estimate @xmath49 , we concentrate on the redshifts @xmath14 between 0.5 and 1.0 , because foreground lensing galaxies for most of the presently confirmed lensed sources are in this redshift range ( e.g. , kochanek 1996 ) . sly find that in this redshift range , the hdf luminosity function for galaxies is represented by a schechter function with the following parameters : @xmath60 the best estimate for @xmath49 is therefore 0.05 , if 30% of the galaxies in the hdf are ellipticals .",
    "if the errors in the parameters were independent of each other , the uncertainty in @xmath49 would be at least a factor of 2 .",
    "however , the parameters in the schechter luminosity function are correlated .",
    "for example , in the century survey ( geller et al .",
    "1997 ) the joint error ellipses for @xmath43 and @xmath61 show that , in the r band , @xmath62 .",
    "it is therefore plausible that a similar relation holds for the hdf luminosity function parameters . > from table  1 of sly",
    ", we find that , for @xmath14 between 0.5 and 1.0 , @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , the absolute normalization is well - determined at the faint end of the luminosity function , where there are many galaxies .",
    "if we fix the number density at @xmath64 , where galaxies are numerous yet still bright enough to be detected reliably , then a variation in @xmath43 determines the values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the 1@xmath8 range in @xmath43 then gives values of @xmath49 in a tight range , between 0.100 and 0.108 .",
    "however , the correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath65 is inexact ; furthermore , other uncertainties , such as in the velocity dispersion @xmath8 , must also be considered . to be conservative and",
    "account for systematic uncertainties in the form of the @xmath8-@xmath16 relation and in the joint errors of the schechter parameters , we allow for an overall uncertainty of 30% , and take @xmath67 .",
    "the first potential detection of a gravitationally lensed source in the hdf is described in hogg et al .",
    "however , the candidacy of this object was later questioned by zepf et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who made keck spectroscopic observations of 3 lens - like objects in the hdf .",
    "these three sources were selected based on the morphological distribution of nearly 750 galaxies , down to a limiting magnitude of 27 in the i - band .",
    "discrepancies in the inferred redshifts of the multiple images suggested that two of the three candidates are not lensed sources , leaving one possible gravitational lens in the hdf down to i of 27 ( l3.2 in zepf et al .",
    "it is possible that even this source is not strongly lensed , but currently the data are inconclusive .",
    "zepf et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that it is unlikely that there is a large population of lensed sources in the hdf that has been missed .",
    "this is especially true for sources brighter than @xmath68 , 1.5 mag above the detection threshold , @xmath28 , of 28.5 in the i - band .",
    "however , in order to take into account the possibility that multiply - imaged sources with faint secondary images ( which still have @xmath69 ) or small angular separations have been missed , we calculate cosmological limits based on the assumed detection of 0 , 1 , or 2 lensed sources with secondary images brighter than @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 in the hdf . as we discuss in more detail in the next section , the limits that follow from the detection of at least one lensed source require knowledge of the redshift of the background lensed source . the single candidate of zepf et al .",
    "( 1997 ) has an uncertain redshift , but the redshift is most probably in the range @xmath73 , with a best guess of 1.02 .",
    "we have calculated the expected number , @xmath36 , of detectable , multiply - imaged galaxies in the hdf , using equation ( 4 ) for various combinations of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath28 , and @xmath43 , the luminosity function power - law slope for galaxies with redshifts between 2 and 3 ( the redshift range expected to produce most of the lensed galaxies in the hdf ) .",
    "we perform each calculation using both the sly and wbt catalogs .",

    ", @xmath36 is essentially a function of the combined quantity @xmath1 .",
    "this degeneracy in the lensing probability ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ; kochanek 1993 ; holz , miller , & quashnock 1999 ) allows us ( see below ) to constrain @xmath1 rather than @xmath2 or @xmath74 individually . in table 1",
    ", we list the expected number of strongly lensed galaxies in the hdf along the @xmath4 line as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "these expected numbers , which are listed for the two catalogs separately , have been calculated assuming @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "we constrain the quantity @xmath78 by comparing the observed and expected number of lensed galaxies in the hdf .",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach , and take a prior for @xmath78 that is uniform between -1 and + 1 .",
    "we do this because we do not yet have a precise determination of this quantity ( although recent high redshift supernovae measurements favor a value near -0.5 ; e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 ) , and we do not wish to consider cosmologies in which either @xmath2 or @xmath3 lie outside the interval [ 0,1 ] . we do not constrain @xmath2 or @xmath3 separately ; thus , no prior is required for these quantities .",
    "since the prior for @xmath78 is uniform , the posterior probability density is simply proportional to the likelihood ( see below ) .",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath36 depend on @xmath78 , and are directly proportional to the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 defined in equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "furthermore , we take into account the uncertainty in @xmath49 by defining @xmath80 and taking @xmath81 to have a mean of unity and standard deviation @xmath82 .",
    "thus , we allow for a 30% uncertainty in @xmath49 ( see   2 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath81 is then an overall correction to the lensing probability , due to a systematic uncertainty in @xmath49 .    the likelihood @xmath83  a function of @xmath78",

[ 4 ] )  we have also calculated the likelihood by varying @xmath43 by @xmath93 0.1 ( the quoted error in sly ) from the best estimate of -2.1 ( for galaxies with redshifts between 2 and 3 , which dominate the expected incidence of multiple imaging ) .    in table 2 , we present the 95% confidence lower limits on @xmath9 for various cases . we define a canonical case in which the lens search has been carried out to @xmath70 , and has found one lensed galaxy ( @xmath94 ) in the hdf with a redshift @xmath95 .",
    "we take @xmath75 in the canonical case . in order to test the effect of different number of lensed galaxies observed in the hdf , we vary @xmath91 from this canonical scenario and assume that all lensed galaxies are at a redshift of 2.5 ( this gives the weakest lower limit ) . the cumulative probabilities for the observed number of lenses , as a function of @xmath1 ,",
    "are shown in figure  3 , where the plotted curves represent no lensed galaxies in hdf ( solid ) , one lensed galaxy ( short - dashed ) and two lensed galaxies ( long - dashed ) .",
    "if there are no lensed galaxies in the hdf , then at the 95% confidence level @xmath96 , so that in a flat universe @xmath97 .",

    "if the galaxy redshift is 1 , then @xmath98 , implying @xmath99 in a flat universe .",
    "if instead the galaxy redshift is 2.5 , then @xmath100 , and hence @xmath5 in a flat universe .",
    "as tabulated in table 2 , the change in i - band lens - search magnitude limit from 28.5 to 27.5 has a surprisingly small effect on the limits on @xmath9 ; the effect of the nondetection of secondary images beyond the limiting magnitude is compensated to some extent by the effect of magnification bias .",
    "except in the case where two strongly lensed galaxies are present in the hdf , @xmath101 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this implies that in a flat universe @xmath102 , which is consistent with the recent cosmological parameter constraints based on the high redshift type ia supernovae ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ) , and with previous limits on the cosmological constant based on gravitational lensing ( e.g. , falco et al . 1998 ; kochanek 1996 ; chiba & yoshi 1997 ) .",
    "_ errors in the photometric redshifts and in f_our calculations rely on the accuracy of photometric redshifts , and hence errors in these redshifts produce errors in the estimated number of lensed galaxies .",
    "the dispersion of redshifts in , e.g. , the wbt catalog with respect to spectroscopically measured ones , range from 0.03 to 0.1 for @xmath103 and 0.14 to 0.36 for @xmath104 . the largest effect this could have on",
    "the expected number of lensed galaxies would occur if the redshifts were _ all _ systematically low or high , by an amount equal to the quoted error .",
    "even in such an extreme case , the 95% confidence lower limit on @xmath1 in our canonical case would only range from -0.64 to -0.50 , using respectively redshifts that are all @xmath105 low and @xmath105 high compared to the best estimates in the wbt catalog .",
    "this is actually a tremendous overestimate of the effect of errors in the photometric redshifts . in reality",
    ", a comparison of the photometric redshifts of wbt with available spectroscopic redshifts indicates that the errors are evenly distributed between high and low estimates , so the overall expected number of lensed galaxies is barely affected .",
    "the only systematic effect visible in the wbt catalog is a paucity of galaxies in the redshift interval of 1.5 to 2.2 .",
    "this has a small but visible effect on our @xmath9 limits ; the results for the wbt catalog are larger than those of the sly catalog by @xmath106 4% .",
    "this increase is primarily due to the peaked distribution of galaxies between redshifts of 2 and 2.5 in the wbt catalog , while the same galaxies have a much broader distribution in the sly catalog .",
    "in addition , about 10 galaxies in the wbt catalog with @xmath107 have @xmath108 in the sly catalog . nonetheless , the two catalogs yield expectations in the number of lensed galaxies that are almost indistinguishable from each other",
    ".    another possible systematic error has to do with the way that the @xmath49 parameter ( eq . [ 5 ] ) is estimated .",
    "one method is to use extensive local surveys of the galaxy luminosity function and velocity dispersions to calculate @xmath49 , then assume that because most foreground lenses are at a redshift less than unity and galaxy evolution out to that redshift is not believed to be dramatic enough to change @xmath49 significantly ( see mao & kochanek 1994 ) , the value of @xmath49 to use in lensing calculations is the same as it is locally .",
    "this is the approach we adopt , and it is supported by the luminosity function in the hdf itself ( see   2.2 ) .",
    "note , however , that if @xmath49 were to be inferred solely from observations of a particular field , such as the hdf , then because the inferred number density and luminosity of galaxies depends on the assumed cosmology , so will @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence of the inferred @xmath49 on cosmology also depends on the relation between luminosity and velocity dispersion , but if @xmath59 , the effect is that @xmath49 is smaller when @xmath109 than when @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as is often assumed .",
    "if @xmath112 , the effect is to decrease @xmath49 by @xmath113% for lenses between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if the field of interest contains a small enough number of potential lenses so that fluctuations are important and @xmath49 must be derived from that field , this effect may have to be included . in the case of the hdf , however ,",
    "the number counts are large and the expected level of fluctuations is small , so we assume that @xmath49 is the same as it is locally .    _ errors in calculating the number of lensed galaxies_another source of systematic error in our study",
    "is that we have used the analytical filled - beam expression to estimate the probability of lensing at high redshift .",
    "this calculation underestimates the true probability based on numerical techniques by about 2% for the galaxy redshifts of the hdf ( holz et al .",
    "thus , we have underestimated the expected number of lensed galaxies in hdf .",
    "this is a systematic error in our calculation , and it implies that our lower limits on @xmath1 have been underestimated by a similar amount .    we have also assumed that lensing galaxies can be described by isothermal spheres .",
    "however , it is likely that galaxies have a non - negligible core radius .",
    "such a core radius can decrease the expected number of lensed galaxies present in the hdf compared to the number calculated assuming a zero core radius .",
    "kochanek ( 1996 ) addressed the issue of a finite core radius by studying lens models described by softened isothermal spheres , and showed that a finite core radius increases the velocity dispersion ; thus , the decrease in lensing probability due to an added core radius is compensated by the increase in velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , the observed core radii of e and s0 galaxies that dominate lensing are much smaller than their einstein radii , and hence the effect of a finite core radius is small ( kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore do not expect the effect of finite galaxy core radii to dramatically change the lower limits on @xmath78 presented in this paper .      _ reddening effects_given that the light from a lensed galaxy must pass near or through a lensing galaxy , the column depth of dust in the foreground of multiply - imaged galaxies",
    "may be systematically higher than for the field as a whole .",
    "hence , the extinction of images could be of considerable importance in lens studies .",
    "most lensing galaxies are in a redshift range @xmath116 , so it is the properties of galaxies at those redshifts that are most important in evaluating the likely effect of extinction .    by comparing radio - selected and optical - selected lens samples , malhotra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that optical lens searches are heavily impaired by extinction due to dust , with a mean magnitude change of 2 @xmath93 1 magnitudes between images .",
    "a different conclusion was reached by falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who suggested that extinction from dust only produces a mean magnitude change of @xmath106 0.5 .",
    "the conclusion of falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that extinction has a minor impact on lensing studies is supported by kochanek ( 1996 ) , who presented a reddening model in lensing statistics and determined that extinction in lensing galaxies decreases the probability of observing multiple lensing by only @xmath10610% .",
    "this calculation concentrated on the @xmath117 elliptical galaxies , which are thought to be fairly similar to the galaxies at @xmath116 that are doing most of the lensing , although the inferred increase in the massive star formation rate near @xmath118 ( e.g. , madau et al . 1998 ) may imply somewhat higher extinction than at low redshifts .",
    "given that there is no detailed analysis of the dust distribution associated with hdf galaxies , we have not included the effects of reddening due to dust in the present calculation . however , our variation of the detection threshold magnitude , @xmath28 , in table  2 is indicative of the possible effects of extinction on our results .",
    "we find that even a change as large as 1 magnitude has a fairly minor effect on our limits .",
    "_ source confusion and image separation effects_the clustering of optical galaxies may confuse lens search programs in two ways : on the one hand , clustering can lead one to infer the existence of multiply - lensed galaxies under the assumption that observed galaxies are images of a lensed background object , when in fact the images are unrelated ; while , on the other hand , clustering of galaxies can confuse lensed - image identification by increasing the surface brightness of the surrounding regions near the images .",
    "the two gravitationally lensed sources found by ratnatunga et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using hst wfpc images have image separations of the order @xmath106 1.2@xmath119 to 1.5@xmath119 .",
    "for presently confirmed lenses , the effective diameter of the foreground lensing galaxies at @xmath120 are of the order @xmath106 1.5@xmath119 , similar to lensed image separations .",
    "thus , galaxy clustering may impair the detection of lensed sources .",
    "this effect may in fact be present in the currently confirmed lensed source sample , where almost all of the lensed sources with small image separations were initially selected in radio searches .",
    "however , gravitationally lensed galaxies typically have image shapes that can be differentiated from random clustering of galaxies , and generally have colors different from foreground galaxies . therefore , a careful examination of the hdf , including both colors and positions , should efficiently reveal lensed sources",
    ". the recent discovery of about 10 new small separation lensed sources in the hst medium deep survey ( k. ratnatunga , private communication ) suggests that efficient lens searches can be and have been made .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that a large number of hdf lenses have been missed , due to galaxy clustering or source confusion .",
    "by comparing the expected number of lensed galaxies in the hdf to the observed number of lensed galaxies , we have presented limits on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we have considered the possibility that present lens search programs may have missed one to three possible lensed galaxies in the hdf , and have given our cosmological parameter constraints for a variety of cases , including the change in limiting magnitude for lens searches .",
    "we find that the expected number of lenses in the hdf is primarily a function of @xmath9 .",
    "a comparison of the expected number of lensed galaxies with the observed number allows us to put a lower limit on the current value of @xmath1 . making use of the hdf luminosity function ( as determined by sly ) , our 95% confidence lower limit on @xmath1 ranges between -0.44 and -0.73 ( see table  2 ) . if the only lensed galaxy in the hdf is the one candidate found by zepf et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , then @xmath121 .",
    "these lower limits are not in conflict with estimates based on high redshift supernovae ( viz . ,",
    "@xmath122 [ riess et al . 1998 ] ) .",
    "as has been recently noted in the literature , combining @xmath1 results from high redshift supernovae measurements with @xmath123 results from cmb power spectrum analysis constrains @xmath2 and @xmath74 separately , with much higher accuracy than the individual experiments alone ( white 1998 ; eisenstein , hu , & tegmark 1998 ) .",
    "we note that gravitational lensing constraints on @xmath9 should also be considered in such an analysis .",
    "we have shown , by comparing our results from two different catalogs , that photometric redshifts can be used to estimate the expected number of lensed galaxies in the hdf with reasonable accuracy .",
    "this bodes well for the upcoming southern hubble deep field redshift catalog that is expected in the near - future .",
    "the southern hdf will double the number of high redshift galaxies and will thus double the expected number of gravitationally lensed galaxies . if , for example , @xmath124 , then from table  1 there could be three lensed galaxies detected in the southern hdf .",
    "the actual number of detected galaxies will lead to strong constraints on @xmath1 .",
