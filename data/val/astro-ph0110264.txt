    "the second recorded outburst of ci aquilae was discovered in 2000 april by takamizawa since the first recorded outburst in 1917 .",
    "after optical brightness reached its maximum , @xmath5 , in early may of 2000 , it rapidly decreased to @xmath6 in about 50 days .",
    "a plateau phase follows ; the brightness leveled off at @xmath7 .",
    "once it rapidly decayed to @xmath8 at the end of november of 2000 , it stayed at @xmath8 until march of 2001 .",
    "ci aql has entered the final decline phase toward its quiescent level from may of 2001 as shown in fig .",
    "1    we have modeled the system consisting of a massive white dwarf ( wd ) and a lobe - filling main - sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "irradiation effects of the accretion disk ( acdk ) and the ms companion by the wd are included into the light curve calculation . the numerical method has been described in hachisu & kato ( 2001b ) .",
    "we are able to reproduce the light curve by adopting model parameters similar to those of u sco ( hachisu et al .",
    "2000 ) . the model parameters including those for the acdk are shown in fig . 1",
    "( see also hachisu & kato 2001a ) .    after the paper of hachisu & kato ( 2001a ) has been published , we have new data on the final decay phase of the 2000 outburst ( schaefer 2001 , private communication ) and , now , are able to determine the turn - off time , the helium content of the envelope , and the duration of luminous supersoft x - ray phase as shown in fig .",
    "1 . we have also revised the physical parameters : the unheated surface temperatures are @xmath9 k of the ms companion , @xmath10 k of the disk rim , the apparent distance modulus @xmath11 , the color excess @xmath12 , the absorption @xmath13 , and the distance to ci aql @xmath14 kpc ."
