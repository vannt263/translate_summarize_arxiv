    "microfluidic devices have found applications in various scientific and industrial processes .",
    "a typical example is their integration as important components of chemical and biological sensors .",
    "@xcite a micromixer is a microfluidic device used for effective mixing of different fluid constituents .",
    "it can be used to efficiently mix for example a variety of bio - reactants such as bacteria cells , large dna molecules , enzymes and proteins in portable integrated microsystems with minimum energy consumption .",
    "it is also used in mixing of solutions in chemical reactions ,  @xcite sequencing of nucleic acids or drug solution dilution .",
    "hence , the design of practical and efficient micromixers is a major research topic in microfluidics ,  @xcite especially in the development of micro total analysis systems . over the years",
    "various methods of efficient mixing have been developed and many of those have been successfully applied in industry .",
    "@xcite    the small length scales of the micromixers has a negative impact on mixing as it results in laminar flows inside the channels . in this flow regime , mixing is influenced mainly by the process of molecular inter - diffusion .",
    "@xcite experiments with channels with complex surface topology including grooved walls have revealed that microscale mixing is enhanced by `` chaotic advection '' , a process which was first reviewed by aref in 1984 .  @xcite he describes how mixing is still possible even at low reynolds number by repeated stretching and folding of fluid elements .",
    "@xcite if properly applied , this mechanism causes the interfacial area between the fluids to increase exponentially , which can then lead to an enhanced intermaterial transport , hence mixing .",
    "a comprehensive mathematical description of the exponential growth of interfacial surfaces can be found in the book by ottino .",
    "@xcite mixers were designed in the following years , which utilize the principle of `` chaotic advection '' .",
    "@xcite however , it is important to note that the term `` chaotic '' is used strictly in a lagrangian sense .",
    "@xcite    depending on the working principle , micromixers can be categorized into two important types : if energy from an external source is used to drive the mixing process , then it is termed as `` active mixer '' .",
    "these external energy sources can be acoustic bubble induced vibrations , periodic variation of the flow rate , piezoelectric vibrating membranes , valves , etc .",
    "the external sources are often moving components such as micropumps and they require advanced fabrication steps .",
    "@xcite the second category of micromixers is based on restructuring the flow profile using static but sophisticated mixer geometries .",
    "these are termed as `` passive mixer '' .",
    "passive micromixers have the advantage of simple fabrication , easy operation and no elements which can generate heat .",
    "the absence of heating is an important factor for applications to biological studies where temperature is a sensitive parameter .",
    "the mixing length and mixing time are defined as the distance and time span the fluid constituents have to flow inside the mixer in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture .",
    "an effective micromixer should reduce the mixing length and mixing time substantially in order to achieve rapid mixing . a common practice to design passive micromixers",
    "is to create alternating thin fluid lamellae .",
    "these result in an interfacial area that increases with the number of lamellae rendering the diffusion process more effective and hence allowing fast mixing .",
    "@xcite there are many examples of bi - lamellation  @xcite and multi - lamellation  @xcite in the literature on micromixers . however , the drawback of such devices is that the number of lamellae is generally limited due to the negative impact on the applied pressure drop caused by the required microstructures inside the channel .",
    "other examples of passive micromixers include the twisted pipe mixer ,  @xcite the superfocus micromixer , where several jets are made to collide at the focal point of the jets and the three dimensional serpentine model .",
    "@xcite    the recently developed so - called `` chaotic micromixer '' has gained substantial interest in the literature since it overcomes some of the drawbacks of conventional mixers based on muti - lamellation .",
    "such a device consists of microstructured objects such as `` herringbones '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) . the staggered herringbone mixer ( shm )",
    "was introduced as one of the first experimental implementations of chaotic micromixers in 2002 by stroock et al .  @xcite the half cycles of the shm consist of grooves with two arms which are asymmetric and unequal in length .",
    "these arms are inclined at an angle of @xmath0 to the wall and @xmath1 against each other , while the pattern interchanges every half cycle of the herringbone .",
    "the peculiar arrangement of the herringbone structure enhances the mixing process by `` chaotic advection '' where the interfacial area between the fluids grows exponentially in time ",
    "another important advantage over mixers using the concept of multi - lamellation .",
    "the shm was used by several authors for studies related to mixing and analysis of mixing quality . to characterize the mixing quality of the shm , aubin et al .",
    "@xcite implemented particle tracking techniques using the variance of tracer dispersion .",
    "li and chen report on an optimization of the shm using the standard deviation of particle concentrations .",
    "as in the current paper , they used the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method to model the flow field .",
    "@xcite further , the shm was used by kirtland et al .",
    "@xcite to study the mass transfer to reactive boundaries from three - dimensional micro - channels .    for the development of micromixers it is important to have reliable tools at hand to quantify their performance .",
    "efficiency and mixing quality have been studied by various methods in the past .",
    "these include the analysis of the probability density function of the flow profiles , studying the stretching of the flow field , the poincar section analysis , or the intensity of segregation as introduced by danckwerts in 1952 .",
    "@xcite in this paper an alternative numerical procedure is presented which is tailored for the optimization of chaotic micromixers .",
    "it is based on lb simulations to describe the flow inside complex mixer geometries together with a measurement of finite time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) as obtained from trajectories of massless tracer particles immersed in the flow .",
    "the lb method can easily handle flows in complex geometries , which makes this method convenient for flows in advanced microstructures such as the micromixers the current paper focuses on .",
    "the lyapunov exponent provides a quantitative measure of long term average growth rates of small initial flow perturbations and thus allows a quantification of the efficiency of chaotic advection .",
    "@xcite since the systems of interest are finite and simulations are limited to a finite time span , the proposed method utilizes wolf s method to calculate the ftle .",
    "@xcite while lb simulations of flows in micromixers and ftle computations to quantify the degree of chaotic advection have been reported in the literature before , their combination for 3d performance quantification of realistic chaotic micromixers has to our knowledge not been published before .",
    "the numerical scheme has the potential to assist an experimental optimization since geometrical parameters or fluid properties can easily be changed without requiring a new experiment . to demonstrate its applicability ,",
    "the scheme is applied to evaluate the parameters of the staggered herringbone mixer that lead to improved performance .    in the following sections the lattice boltzmann method which is applied to simulate the fluid flow and the wolf s algorithm from which the finite time lyapunov exponents are obtained are described .",
    "finally , the numerical results and conclusions are given .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method is used to describe the fluid flow .",
    "the lb method is a simplified approach to solve the boltzmann equation in discrete space , time and with a limited set of discrete velocities .",
    "@xcite the boltzmann equation , given as @xmath2 represents the evolution of the velocity distribution function by molecular transport and binary intermolecular collisions .",
    "@xmath3 represents the distribution of velocities in continuous position and velocity space , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . in the lb approach the position @xmath6 at which @xmath7 is defined ,",
    "is restricted to a discrete set of points on a regular lattice with lattice constant @xmath8 , implying that space is discretized .",
    "the velocity is restricted to a set of velocities @xmath9 implying that velocity is discretized along specific directions .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the discrete time step .",
    "the model we adopt is a d3q19 model which is a 3 dimensional model with 19 different velocity directions , @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite the right hand side of the above equation represents the collision operator which is simplified to the linear bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) form .",
    "@xcite in a discretized form the bgk operator is written as @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the reciprocal of the relaxation time of the system controlling the relaxation towards the maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium distribution @xmath14 . by considering small velocities and constant temperature ,",
    "a discretized third order taylor expansion of the above equilibrium distribution function can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the equilibrium distribution function corresponding to the velocity vector @xmath9 , @xmath17 are the lattice weights , @xmath18 is the density , @xmath19 a reference density , and @xmath20 is the speed of sound .",
    "@xmath21 is the equilibrium velocity of the fluid , which is shifted from the mean velocity by an amount @xmath22 under the influence of a constant acceleration @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of the lb process takes place in two steps : the collision step where the velocities are redistributed along the directions of the lattice and the propagation step by which they are displaced along these directions .",
    "these discrete lb steps are implemented by the equation @xmath24 which gives the dynamic evolution of the distribution function and is referred to as a discretized boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "the macroscopic fluid density is given by @xmath25 and the macroscopic fluid velocity in the presence of external forcing is given by  @xcite @xmath26 it can be shown by a chapman - enskog expansion that the macroscopic fields @xmath27 and @xmath18 from the above equations fulfill the navier stokes equation in the low mach number limit and for isothermal systems .",
    "@xcite in order to simulate a fluid flow through microchannels , periodic boundary conditions are implemented along the @xmath28 direction ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) and no - slip bounce back boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls .",
    "the experimental setup of stroock et al .",
    "consists of a number of repeated cycles ( @xmath2915 ) consisting of two asymmetric half cycles each . by simulating one full cycle only and applying periodic boundary conditions we can reduce the required computational effort substantially .",
    "if the system is in steady state , we do not expect any substantial differences in the flow field in different cycles .",
    "therefore , this approach is valid .",
    "if , however , the experimental system would not be periodic , such a simplification would not be allowed and the full geometry would have to be simulated .",
    "we simulate a fluid which is hydrodynamically similar to water , flowing inside a shm with a cross section of @xmath30 .",
    "the length of the channel is @xmath31 , but can be varied in order to always accommodate a full cycle of the herringbone structure . for computational efficiency",
    "we have chosen a lattice resolution of @xmath32 resulting in a fixed cross section of @xmath33 and system lengths of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "such a relatively low resolution is sufficient to properly resolve the flow field as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ profile ] , where the velocity field perpendicular to the flow is shown at positions within different half cycles ( a , b ) .",
    "[ profile]c ) shows the profile in flow direction .",
    "while the first two subfigures nicely demonstrate the swirling motion of the flow , the third one depicts how the flow penetrates between the grooves and stays mostly unaffected close to the upper boundary of the channel .",
    "previously , we have shown that a well resolved velocity field with less than 4 percent error as compared to the analytical solution can be obtained even for a resolution of 6 - 8 lattice nodes in the case of a 3d rectangular poiseuille flow .",
    "@xcite we further demonstrated that flow over random rough surfaces can be well resolved even if the smallest obstacles are only described by 2 - 4  lattice units .",
    "@xcite in the lb method , the kinematic viscosity is related to the discrete time step through the expression @xmath35 . since @xmath36",
    "is chosen to be @xmath37 to minimize artefacts due to the mid - grid bounce back boundary conditions and the simulated fluid has the kinematic viscosity of water , @xmath38 , this implies for the current choice of @xmath8 that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . when the magnitude of @xmath23 is @xmath41 along the @xmath28 direction , the average steady state velocity of the system is @xmath42 which corresponds to a subsonic flow .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath43 of the flow is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the characteristic length of the channel .",
    "one set of simulations is obtained for @xmath23 being @xmath46 which corresponds to @xmath47 .    when the flow simulation has reached its steady state , @xmath48 massless and non - interacting tracer particles",
    "are introduced at fluid nodes in the @xmath49 plane and then their velocities are integrated at each time step . to calculate the ftle from particle trajectories a group of five particles forms four pairs , with every 5th particle placed at the center and the remaining ones being placed at the four nearest off - diagonal neighboring lb lattice sites .",
    "the particle at the center traces a fiducial orbit . with this arrangement",
    "we are able to follow 800  particle pairs by using only 1000  particles .",
    "the trajectories are obtained by integrating the vector equation of motion @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the position vector of an individual tracer particle .",
    "the velocity @xmath52 is obtained from the discrete lb velocity field through a trilinear interpolation scheme .",
    "ll a ) & b ) +   &   +   +    `` chaotic '' systems in general have the important feature that two nearby trajectories diverge exponentially in time . the rate at which these trajectories diverge can be related to the ability of the flow field to create conditions for chaotic mixing . the lyapunov exponent is a possible measure of the performance of a micromixer as it is related to the rate of stretching of the fluid elements .",
    "it is defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the distance between two trajectories at time @xmath55 which evolve from an initial separation @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 gives the value of the lyapunov exponent as @xmath55 tends to infinity .",
    "due to the finite size of any microfluidic system it is not possible to implement this definition in a simulation code to study the performance of a micromixer also , when two trajectories separate from each other , this definition does not allow to understand the ongoing stretching and folding dynamics of the flow .",
    "a quantitative measure of the mixer performance based on the lyapunov exponent can be obtained by using the ftle instead of the previous expression .",
    "@xcite the ftle takes the dynamical process more completely into account and provides a numerically implementable scheme for quantification of the performance of mixers .",
    "the ftle is defined as  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath55 is any particular instant of time and @xmath59 is a finite time after which the ftle is measured . the same process is repeated over @xmath60 times , where @xmath60 is a large number denoting the number of times the ftle is evaluated from trajectories of particle pairs .",
    "amon et al . named the ftle as finite time lagrangian lyapunov exponent .",
    "@xcite the convergence of the average ftle to the lyapunov exponent for large @xmath60 is discussed in the paper by tang and boozer ,  @xcite @xmath61    wolf et al . suggested a method to calculate the ftle from a set of experimental data which is well applicable to our simulations .",
    "@xcite the key idea of the method is to monitor the distance between particles forming a pair and to renormalize it by moving back one of the two particles towards the other one in case they have separated more than a given threshold distance . the ftle is then computed from the sum of individual lyapunov exponents measured between replacements .",
    "the method has been verified on systems with known lyapunov spectra and exact results have been achieved . following wolf s approach , we implement the following equation to quantify the mixer performance on the basis of the average ftle as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64th time when a ftle is evaluated , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the distance between particle pairs at time step @xmath67 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "@xmath68 is the number of time steps which a pair of particles take until the next replacement and its magnitude could be different for each measure .",
    "@xmath60 is the total number of replacements made until time @xmath55 when @xmath69 is evaluated .",
    "if @xmath69 has a positive and non - zero value the particles separate from each other at an exponential rate .",
    "these particle pairs are initially very close to each other and evolve in time .",
    "if the separation between the pair is greater than a maximum distance , the distance between the particles is re - adjusted to the initial distance @xmath70 .",
    "for the implementation of the scheme , for every particle pair one of the trajectories is chosen as the fiducial path , while the position of the other particle is replaced if the distance becomes larger than the threshold value .",
    "this is schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "the choice of the maximum distance is based on a variation of it together with a comparison of the obtained ftle : if it is chosen too large , many tracer particles hit the channel walls and do not separate any further resulting in a too low value of the ftle . if it is chosen too small , the tracers do not have a sufficient amount of time to separate sufficiently so that an exponential increase of the distance can not be detected . the chosen value @xmath71 has been found to be a good compromise between the two extreme cases .",
    "in order to avoid errors due to orientation one of the particles of a pair is placed along the line of separation . in case a replacement point can not be found due to a wall node present at the location , a nearby fluid node is selected as the replacement point .",

    "the following section presents how ftle can be utilized for an optimization strategy for chaotic micromixers . as an example , the influence of different parameters which directly affect the performance of the shm is evaluated .",
    "these are the ratio of the height of the grooves to the height of the channel @xmath74 , the ratio of the horizontal length of the long arm to the channel width @xmath75 , the ratio of distance between the grooves to the length of the channel @xmath76 and the number of grooves per half cycle @xmath77 .",
    "the width of the grooves is kept fixed at @xmath78 for all simulations .",
    "[ fig_1 ] provides a pictorial representation of these parameters .",
    "the performance of the shm is studied by varying four geometrical parameters . while keeping all other parameters fixed ( @xmath790.089 , @xmath800.2 , @xmath77=10 ) , the width fraction ( @xmath81 )",
    "is varied within the range of 0.5 and 0.82 and the distance fraction ( @xmath82 ) from 0.04 to 0.11 .",
    "then , the number of grooves per half cycle ( @xmath77 ) is varied from 2 to 10 and the height fraction ( @xmath83 ) from 0.125 to 0.343 .",
    "the optimization of the shm as presented here is meant to demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm only since several optimization studies of the shm are already available in the literature .",
    "therefore our optimization is reduced to a limited variation of the four dimensional parameter space .",
    "this surely leads to a local optimum of the geometrical parameters , but it is not assured that the global optimum has been found . however , as shown below , our parameters corespond to the optimal ones found by other groups suggesting that our local optimum coincides with the global optimum .    fig .",

    "the value of @xmath91 depends on the width fraction @xmath75 as it is further investigated below . ]",
    "when one of the parameters is varied it is taken care that the other parameters remain unchanged , because we are interested in the dependence of the individual parameters on the performance of the shm .",
    "[ fig_4 ] shows the variance of @xmath91 and as such the performance of the shm with respect to the parameter @xmath75 for two different reynolds numbers , @xmath94 and 1.3 .",

    "due to the symmetry of the mixer geometry , only values for @xmath95 are shown .",
    "the datasets peak at @xmath96 , which implies that the degree of chaotic advection is maximized for this particular value of the width fraction @xmath75 . according to the units chosen above this corresponds to @xmath97 .",

    "a possible explanation is as follows : when the grooves are very close to each other , they create `` dead spaces '' , i.e. regions in the micro - channel where the fluid gets trapped and can not move freely . with increasing the distance between the grooves , the transverse component of the velocity increases , hence `` chaotic advection '' is enhanced resulting a large value for @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig_7 ] clearly shows that a staggered herringbone mixer with @xmath106 performs best .",
    "the existence of a maximum performance in dependence on the number of grooves can be explained by the fact that interplay between advection in flow direction and the swirling motion needs to be optimized for a well performing mixer .",
    "if the number of grooves is too small , the flow field is not sufficiently rotated when flowing through a half cycle .",
    "the change of direction of the swirling motion at the beginning of the following half cycle does not result in a relevant distortion of the trajectories then .",

    "<S> the ability of the fluid to mix well depends on the rate at which `` chaotic advection '' occurs in the mixer . </S>",
    "<S> an optimization of mixer geometries is a non trivial task which is often performed by time consuming and expensive trial and error experiments . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> an algorithm is presented that applies the concept of finite - time lyapunov exponents to obtain a quantitative measure of the chaotic advection of the flow and hence the performance of micromixers . by performing lattice </S>",
    "<S> boltzmann simulations of the flow inside a mixer geometry , introducing massless and non - interacting tracer particles and following their trajectories the finite time lyapunov exponents can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of the method is demonstrated by a comparison of the improved geometrical structure of the staggered herringbone mixer with available literature data . </S>"
