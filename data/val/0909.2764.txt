    "the knowledge of correlations is important and interesting for any system .",
    "looking from the practical point of view correlation means additional information : if two quantities are correlated , the knowledge of one of them implies certain information about the other one . in physical systems correlations",
    "usually indicate interactions between parts of the system .",
    "the prototypical example is given by the ising spin system where the nearest - neighbors interactions induce long - range correlations leading to a phase transition .",
    "the situation in random graphs is somewhat different .",
    "it is known that for random geometries even in the absence of any explicit terms inducing interactions between vertices their degree may be correlated @xcite . moreover , those correlations are long - range , i.e. , they fall off as some power of distance @xcite .",
    "they are generated by model constraints rather than by explicit interactions .",
    "it should be also stressed that the distance dependent correlation functions in the ensemble of random graphs are much more complicated objects than their fixed lattice counterparts @xcite . to see that let us take some generic correlation function on random graphs @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the _ degree _ of the vertex @xmath2 , i.e. , the number of branches emerging from it . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are some arbitrary functions depending on the vertex degree and @xmath5 is the graph ( geodesic ) distance between vertices @xmath2 and @xmath6 . for random geometry",
    "it makes no sense in general to choose two fixed points  that is why we sum over all the pairs of points on the graph .",
    "the graph distance is the length of the shortest path between those two vertices and as such it is dependent on the whole graph .",
    "that means that the above expression is not a two - point function but a highly nonlocal object .",
    "that is a fundamental difference between random and fixed geometries .    in this paper",
    ", we study in detail correlations between degrees of vertices as a function of distance .",
    "we consider an ensemble of all labeled trees @xmath7 with a fixed number of vertices @xmath8 , on which we define the probability measure @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the partition function of this ensemble ( normalization factor ) and @xmath1 is the degree of vertex @xmath2 ; @xmath11 s @xmath12 are some non - negative numbers ( weights ) .",
    "this is a maximal - entropy ensemble with a given degree distribution ( see appendix ) .",
    "an important property of the measure is that it factorizes into a product of one - point measures , so it does not introduce any explicit correlations .",
    "this means that any observed correlations arise from the fact that we consider a specific set of graphs and not from the measure itself .",
    "we show that the connected degree - degree correlations are not zero and fall off with the distance as @xmath13 @xmath14 ^ 2}\\,\\pi_q\\pi_r.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the joint probability that two vertices distance @xmath16 apart will have degrees @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
