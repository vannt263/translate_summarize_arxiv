    "the oberbeck - boussinesq approximation , so named after the pioneering works by oberbeck @xcite and boussinesq @xcite , is the basis of most of the contemporary studies on natural or mixed convection flows .",
    "very interesting historical surveys on the origins of this approximation are available in the recent papers by zeytounian @xcite and bois @xcite .",
    "although the nature of this approximation is very clear and unambiguous with reference to the mass and momentum balance equations for the fluid , the formulation of the approximated energy balance equation is not so definite and univocal .",
    "the questions concerning the energy balance equations are the following :    )     which is the specific heat involved in the energy balance ?    is there a pressure work term in the energy balance , proportional to the convective derivative of the pressure field ?",
    "the textbooks on fluid dynamics and heat transfer generally give clear answers to these questions .",
    "the problem , as it will be discussed in section [ enbal ] , is that the answers are different .    in a recent technical note @xcite , the present author carried out a first analysis of the existing formulations of the local energy balance adopted in the oberbeck - boussinesq approximation of buoyant flows .    the purpose of this short paper is to extend the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to point out the manifold nature of the energy balance formulations , within the framework of the oberbeck - boussinesq approximation , available in the literature .",
    "then , a thermodynamic argument is proposed in order to give answers to questions a ) and b ) . in particular",
    ", it will be concluded that the answer to question a ) depends on the fluid being a liquid or a gas . for a perfect gas",
    "the answer to question a ) is definitely : `` the specific heat at constant volume @xmath0 '' . for a liquid",
    "the answer to question a ) is less definite , but sufficiently reliable : `` the specific heat at constant pressure @xmath1 '' .",
    "the answer to question b ) is : `` no pressure work term appears in the energy balance '' . in a final section , the analysis of the energy balance is applied to the topic of buoyant flows in fluid saturated porous media .",
    "as is well known , the oberbeck - boussinesq approximation implies that the local mass and momentum balance equations be written as @xmath2 @xmath3 where the summation over repeated indices is assumed . in eq .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) . in eq .  ( [ 3 ] ) , the dependence on @xmath19 is assumed to be sufficiently weak to be approximated linearly in the surroundings of the reference value @xmath13 .",
    "for the energy balance , the formulation of the oberbeck - boussinesq approximation is not so definite in the literature .",
    "in fact , one may have chandrasekhar s @xcite and white s @xcite formulation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath22 is the dynamic viscosity and @xmath23 is the strain tensor @xmath24 the source term in eq .",

    "one may have the enthalpy formulation @xcite @xmath26 where the last term on the right hand side is an additional source term : the pressure work acting on the fluid element .",

    "the meaning of the terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is straightforward : the first term is the incoming heat flux contribution to the energy change , while the second term is the mechanical work input due to the forces acting on the boundary of the fluid element .",

    "this reasoning is erroneous as the nature of the thermodynamic process undergone by the fluid element is implicitly defined by the equation of state assumed , _",
    "i.e. _ eq .  ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "this equation of state is based on the hypothesis that the density may change only as a consequence of temperature variations . in other words",

    "( [ 15 ] ) is connected to the mechanical work term @xmath65 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) . on the other hand , in some textbooks ( see , for instance , kundu and cohen @xcite ) , a part of the mechanical work term @xmath65 , namely the expansion - contraction work contribution , @xmath67 , is rewritten by forgetting eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and by using the exact local mass balance instead , @xmath68 if one brings this term to left hand side of the local energy balance eq .",

    "( [ 7 ] ) , instead of eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "however , this is a tricky procedure , since the velocity field evaluated through the oberbeck - boussinesq model is constrained to be solenoidal by eq .",

    "( [ 20c ] ) can not be coherently invoked within the oberbeck - boussinesq approximation .",

    "( [ 6 ] ) adds an unjustified assumption ( an isochoric process ) to a tricky procedure that replaces the simple conclusion @xmath80 with the more complicated one expressed by eq .  ( [ 26b ] ) .",
    "this circumstance induces some reflections on how the erroneous assumption of isochoric process can lead to ambiguous results , depending on the procedure followed . on the contrary",
