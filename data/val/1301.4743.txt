    "recently , a lot of new experimental results are reported on charmed baryons  @xcite .",
    "babar and belle give very accurate results based on their precise analysis .",
    "in addition , new experiments such as j - parc , panda , lhcb , and belle ii are coming and expected to give further informations for charmed baryons .",
    "mass spectrum of singly charmed baryons has been determined experimentally in high accuracy .",
    "experimental status for masses of the ground state is evaluated as three or four - star by the particle data group .",
    "the excited states are also investigated fairly well .",
    "in contrast to singly charmed baryons , experimental data for doubly and triply charmed baryons are not well established . a candidate for the doubly charmed baryon , @xmath4 ,",
    "has been reported only by the selex collaboration  @xcite , while @xmath4 has not been confirmed yet by other experimental groups such as babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite .",
    "further experimental and theoretical confirmations are required to establish @xmath4 .",
    "other doubly charmed baryons and any triply charmed baryons have not been observed by experiments . in this situation ,",
    "theoretical predictions for the doubly and triply charmed baryon masses may give useful information for the experimental discovery of these states .",
    "charmed baryon spectrum has been mainly investigated using gauge configurations generated with 2 + 1 flavors dynamical staggered quarks  @xcite . in this case",
    ", a choice for light valence quarks requires a special care : one may take other fermion formulations for the valence light quarks ( the mixed action ) to avoid a problem due to a complicated flavor structure of the staggered quarks .",
    "alternatively one may construct charmed baryon operators with the valence naive quark and then rewrite the correlation function of these operators in terms of the staggered propagators  @xcite .",
    "both approaches violate the unitarity of the theory at finite lattice spacing , in addition to the rooting problem of dynamical staggered quarks .",
    "therefore it is necessary to check their results using other combinations of dynamical and valence quarks which maintain the unitarity at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "another issue in the existing calculations on dynamical staggered configurations is that their chiral extrapolations suffer from large higher order corrections .",
    "nlo su(2 ) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is employed to extrapolate their data to the physical point from 220  290 mev pion masses , but the result shows a bad convergence even at @xmath5  mev . a calculation directly at the physical quark masses without chiral extrapolation is the best way to remove this uncertainty .",
    "there are a few investigations with other fermion formulations .",
    "s.  drr _ et al _ have calculated charmed omega baryon masses using smeared improved wilson and brillouin fermions for valence strange and charm quarks  @xcite .",
    "though their calculation is performed only at one quark mass ( @xmath6  mev ) and one lattice spacing ( @xmath7  fm ) on the @xmath8 @xmath9-improved wilson quark ensemble , they obtained a result which is consistent with the experimental value for the singly charmed omega baryon ( @xmath10 ) mass .",
    "the etmc has studied charmed baryons on ensembles generated with @xmath8 dynamical twisted - mass quarks , employing the same twisted - mass fermion for degenerate up and down valence quarks and osterwalder - seiler fermions for strange and charm valence quarks  @xcite . for a doubly charmed baryon",
    ", they have found @xmath11 gev .",
    "this is the only result that is consistent with the selex experimental value @xmath12  gev , while other lattice qcd results deviate from this value .",
    "reasons for this disagreement among lattice qcd results must be understood and should be eventually resolved .",
    "one possible source for systematic uncertainties in the etmc calculation is a lattice artifact caused by the heavy charm quark mass at their lattice spacings , @xmath13  fm . indeed their results for charmed baryon masses , especially for @xmath14",
    ", do not show clear scaling behaviors . to reduce this uncertainty ,",
    "one must employ a heavy quark action that handles mass dependent lattice artifacts in the formulation , such as the fermilab action  @xcite , the relativistic heavy quark action  @xcite , or highly improved actions .",
    "chiral extrapolation of etmc data from @xmath15  mev using the nlo heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is another source of systematic uncertainties , as in the case of staggered quarks .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the present authors have shown that the charm quark mass corrections are under control at @xmath2  gev by adopting the relativistic heavy quark action of ref .",
    "it removes the leading cutoff errors of @xmath16 and the next to leading effects of @xmath17 for arbitrary order @xmath18 by tuning finite number of parameters . employing this action for the charm quark",
    ", we have investigated properties of mesons involving charm quarks with the 2 + 1 dynamical flavor pacs - cs configurations on @xmath0 lattice  @xcite reweighted to the physical point for up , down and strange quark masses .",
    "we have found our results for charmed meson masses are consistent with experiment at a percent level , and so are those for the decay constants with a few percent accuracy , though our results are obtained at a single lattice spacing .    encouraged by this result , we have extended our investigation to the charmed baryon sector and report the result in this paper .",
    "one of the big advantage in our investigation over previous calculations is that the chiral extrapolation is no more necessary , since our calculations are performed at the physical point .",
    "we are free from the convergence problem of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we first compare our masses of singly charmed baryons with the corresponding experimental values , to check if our method works also for the baryon sector . we then evaluate the doubly and triply charmed baryon spectra as our predictions .",

    "our investigation is based on a set of @xmath19 flavor dynamical lattice qcd configurations generated by the pacs - cs collaboration  @xcite on a @xmath20 lattice using the nonperturbatively @xmath9-improved wilson quark action with @xmath21  @xcite and the iwasaki gauge action  @xcite at @xmath22 .",
    "the aggregate of 2000 md time units were generated at the hopping parameter given by @xmath23 , and 80 configurations separated by 25 md time units were selected for our calculations .",
    "we then reweight those configurations to the physical point given by @xmath24 .",
    "the reweighting shifts the masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons from @xmath27  mev and @xmath28  mev to @xmath29  mev and @xmath30  mev , with the cutoff at the physical point estimated to be @xmath2  gev from the @xmath1 baryon mass .",

    "[ figure : mass_singly_charmed_experiment ] .",
    "all our values for the charmed baryon masses are predictions from lattice qcd , since the physical charm quark mass has already been fixed by the mass for the spin - averaged @xmath31 charmonium state and no other experimental inputs for charmed baryon masses are required .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , our prediction for the singly charmed baryon spectrum in lattice qcd at a single lattice spacing is in reasonable agreement with the experimental one . in fig .",

    "these agreements indicate that the decomposition of @xmath34 @xmath35-type and @xmath36-type baryons , as well as that of @xmath37 and @xmath34 charmed baryons , have been made successfully in our calculation .",

    "first , finite size effects are not taken into account .",
    "although the nlo heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory predicts that finite size effects for charmed baryons are less than 1 % , higher order terms may give significant contributions .",
    "a direct confirmation in lattice qcd by comparing spectra among different lattice volumes is desirable .",
    "second , strong decays such as @xmath39 are not taken into account in our analysis , since @xmath39 is kinematically prohibited on our lattice volume .",
    "last but not least , our results are obtained at a single lattice spacing without continuum extrapolation . although a naive order counting gives a percent level of cutoff effects from @xmath40 terms in the relativistic heavy quark action , the continuum extrapolation is necessary to remove this uncertainty .",
    "additional calculations should be performed in the future to remove all systematic errors mentioned above .",
    "for doubly and triply charmed baryons , an experimental value has been reported only for @xmath4 , though the experimental status is controversial . in the other channels ,",
