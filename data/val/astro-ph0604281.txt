    "the merger of two supermassive black holes will produce a gravitational - wave burst .",
    "the observed burst event rate depends on the number density and frequency of black - hole mergers : the number of observed gravitational - wave bursts per unit time ( @xmath4 ) that originate from a shell of comoving radius @xmath5 and width @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the smbh merger rate per comoving volume as a function of redshift .",

    "the observed gravitational - wave burst rate from smbh mergers is obtained by integrating equation ( [ dbdz ] ) over the redshifts from which the bursts are detectable .",
    "lisa will be able to detect nearly all mergers of two black holes with masses greater than @xmath14 and less than @xmath15 up to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "since more massive binary - black - hole systems emit gravitational radiation at lower frequencies and the observed frequency decreases with redshift , very distant ( @xmath17 ) mergers of smbhs with masses greater than @xmath15 produce signals below lisa s frequency window @xcite .",
    "however , the number density of @xmath15 haloes is exponentially suppressed at redshifts greater than four , so it is extremely unlikely that two black holes larger than @xmath15 will merge at redshifts @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the upper bounds on the relevant redshift and smbh mass intervals are determined by the population of supermassive black holes and not lisa s sensitivity .",
    "the transition from the rate of halo mergers to the rate of detectable smbh mergers [ @xmath8 as defined in equation ( [ dbdr ] ) ] requires a relationship between the mass of a halo and the mass of the smbh at its centre .",
    "since lisa is sensitive to smbh mergers at high redshifts , this @xmath19 relation must be applicable to high redshifts as well .",
    "observations of galaxies out to @xmath20 reveal a redshift - independent correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the connection between @xmath21 and halo mass is mediated by the circular velocity @xmath22 . using a sample of thirteen spiral galaxies ,",
    "@xcite measured a relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "combining these measurements with the compiled relationship between smbh mass and @xmath21 presented by @xcite reveals that observations are consistent with a redshift - independent @xmath23 relation .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism for black - hole - mass regulation that would result in a @xmath23 relation between central - black - hole mass and disc circular velocity for all redshifts .",
    "they postulated that a black hole ceases to accrete when the power radiated by the accretion exceeds the binding energy of the host galactic disc divided by the dynamical time of the disc . assuming that the accretion disc shines at its eddington luminosity , the black hole stops growing when @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fraction of the radiated power which is transferred to gas in the disc . setting @xmath25 to 0.07 brings equation ( [ wlmbh ] ) into agreement with the observations presented by @xcite .",
    "the final step in the determination of a halo  black - hole - mass relation is to connect the circular velocity to the halo mass via the virial velocity @xcite .",
    "the simplest possible assumption is that the circular velocity of the disc equals the virial velocity of the halo .",
    "this assumption is made by @xcite , and we assume that @xmath26 throughout this paper .",
    "however , different relations between @xmath22 and @xmath27 have been proposed and can significantly impact the final @xmath28-@xmath29 relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that @xmath26 , the halo mass then becomes a redshift - dependent function of the mass of the central black hole : @xmath30 where @xmath31 the matter density in units of the critical density as a function of redshift , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the nonlinear over - density at virialization for a spherical top - hat perturbation in a @xmath0cdm universe : @xmath34 - 39[{\\omega_{\\rm m}}(z)-1]^2 . \\label{delc}\\ ] ] figure [ fig : bhmass ] shows the masses of haloes that contain supermassive black holes of several masses .",
    "citing the fact that the largest haloes observed at low redshifts appear to contain galaxy clusters with no central black holes , @xcite argue that supermassive - black - hole growth was complete by @xmath35 and that local smbh masses reflect the limiting values at that redshift .",
    "consequently , when determining the mass of a halo that contains a black hole of a given mass , we use the @xmath36 value of equation ( [ mbhmhalo ] ) for all redshifts less than one .    some calculations of the lisa smbh - merger event rate impose a minimum halo virial temperature instead of a minimum black - hole mass when calculating the lower mass bound on haloes that contribute to the smbh merger rate @xcite .",
    "this constraint reflects the fact that supermassive black holes only form when the gas within dark - matter haloes can cool .",
    "however , the relation between virial temperature and virial mass @xcite may be be used to eliminate the halo mass in equation ( [ mbhmhalo ] ) in favour of the virial temperature .",
    "the redshift - dependent terms cancel , leaving a redshift - independent relation between black - hole mass and halo virial temperature : @xmath37 therefore , defining the minimum halo mass by a minimum halo virial temperature is nearly equivalent to defining it by a minimum black - hole mass via equation ( [ mbhmhalo ] ) .",
    "for example , requiring that the halo s virial temperature be significantly higher than the temperature of the intergalactic medium , @xmath38 @xcite , corresponds to imposing a minimum black - hole mass of @xmath39 .",
    "the only discrepancy occurs when @xmath40 , because we assume that the @xmath28@xmath29 relation is fixed for redshifts less than one , while @xmath41 is still redshift dependent .",
    "however , we shall see that nearly all smbh mergers occur at redshifts greater than one , so this difference is negligible .",

    "the second pillar of eps merger theory is the merger probability function derived by @xcite , which gives the probability that a halo of mass @xmath50 will become a halo of mass @xmath51 per unit time , per unit acquired mass : @xmath52 .",

    "following , it is revealing to examine a different quantity , which does not differentiate between the two merging haloes : the rate of mergers between haloes of masses @xmath50 and @xmath54 per comoving volume , @xmath56 the eps self - inconsistency documented by manifests itself here .",
    "although @xmath57 must be symmetric in its mass arguments by definition , equation ( [ rdef ] ) is not symmetric under exchange of @xmath50 and @xmath54 .",
    "the mass asymmetry of eps merger theory becomes most transparent when one defines a new function : the merger kernel . from its definition",
    ", it is apparent that @xmath57 should be proportional to the number densities of both haloes involved in the merger . extracting this dependence defines the merger kernel @xmath58 : @xmath59 in addition to isolating the source of the mass - asymmetry in eps merger theory , the merger kernel enters into the coagulation equation which is inverted to obtain bkh merger rates , as described in section [ sec : bkh ] .",
    "the eps merger kernel @xmath60 is the probability function given by equation ( [ dpdmdt ] ) divided by the number density of haloes of mass @xmath54 given by equation ( [ psn ] ) . in effect , eps merger theory includes two distinct merger kernels , depending on the order of the mass arguments .",
    "thus , we define two mass - symmetric merger kernels : @xmath61 equals the eps merger kernel with the more massive halo as the first argument , while @xmath62 equals the eps merger kernel with the less massive halo as the first argument .",
    "figure [ fig : qmvsql ] illustrates the differences in the merger kernels @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that neither @xmath65 nor @xmath66 are viable candidates for the true halo merger kernel because they are not smooth functions of halo mass .",

    "specifically , @xcite effectively used @xmath64 to predict an event rate for lisa , while @xcite effectively used @xmath63 . using the other version of the eps merger kernel in either of these calculations",

    "cole merger probability function uses some mixture of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and changing the mixture will change the result of the calculation .",
    "the rate of smbh mergers per comoving volume follows from the rate of halo mergers per comoving volume given in equation ( [ rdef ] ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the minimum halo mass that contains a black hole massive enough to be detected when it mergers with a black hole of equal or greater mass .",
    "the factor of 1/2 accounts for the double counting of mergers . some calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only include mergers between haloes with mass ratios less than three and so integrate @xmath54 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "this restriction is motivated by dynamical - friction calculations that indicate that when a halo merges with a halo less than a third of its size , it takes longer than a hubble time for their central black holes to merge @xcite .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations indicate that this restriction may be too strict ; when gas dynamics are included , smbhs with host - galaxy - mass ratios greater than three merge within a hubble time @xcite .",
    "we do not impose any restrictions on the halo - mass ratios , so our event rates are upper bounds arising from the assumption that every halo merger in which both haloes contain a smbh results in a smbh merger .",
    "since lisa should observe mergers between two smbhs with masses greater than @xmath14 out to redshifts of at least eight , we generally use this minimum black hole mass to determine @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding rates of smbh mergers per comoving volume are shown in figure [ fig : scrinmbh ] , as well as the rates which correspond to different choices for the minimum mass of a smbh .",
    "both versions of @xmath71 are shown to illustrate the difference between the two lacey  cole merger kernels .",
    "the crimp in @xmath8 at @xmath72 reflects the transition from a constant @xmath68 ( evaluated at @xmath36 ) to the redshift - dependent form given by equation ( [ mbhmhalo ] ) .",
    "once the rate @xmath8 of smbh mergers per volume is known , equation ( [ dbdz ] ) may be integrated over redshift to obtain an event rate for lisa .",
    "figure [ fig : gwemmin ] shows the lisa event rate as a function of the minimum halo mass that contains a black hole large enough to emit an observable signal . figure [ fig : gwevsz ] shows the event rate as a function of the maximum redshift of a detectable merger . in figure",

    "the levelling of the event rate for @xmath79 indicates that smbh mergers are very rare at higher redshifts and that the event rate is dominated by mergers that occur at redshifts @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the upper bound on lisa s sensitivity to larger smbh mergers at high redshifts will have little effect on the event rate .",
    "the event rates shown in figures [ fig : gwemmin ] and [ fig : gwevsz ] differ significantly from those calculated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our event rates are generally much higher than the event rates reported by @xcite because we do not exclude mergers between haloes with mass ratios greater than three from our smbh merger rate .",
    "the event rates calculated by @xcite are even lower because they do not assume that all haloes contain galaxies .",
    "the one case where our event rates are not substantially higher than those derived by @xcite is when the minimum black - hole mass is taken to be very high ( @xmath81 ) . in that case , the minimum halo mass is so high that nearly all mergers involve haloes of similar masses ( @xmath82 ) , and the galaxy - occupation fraction derived by @xcite indicates that nearly all haloes of this size contain galaxies for redshifts greater than three , so our event rate of 12 per year is very similar to the result of the more sophisticated treatment of @xcite .",
    "event rates obtained from both versions of the eps merger kernel are shown in figures [ fig : gwemmin ] and [ fig : gwevsz ] .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : gwevsz ] , the event rate obtained from @xmath63 is slightly higher than the rate obtained from @xmath64 , indicating that mergers with halo mass ratios less than @xmath83 are dominating the sum ( see figure [ fig : qmvsql ] ) .",
    "for a constant value of @xmath84 , the difference between the two versions decreases as the maximum redshift increases , as shown in figure [ fig : gwemmin ] .",
    "this convergence indicates that the contribution from mergers between haloes of greatly unequal masses to the event rate dwindles as redshift increases . since the lower bound on halo mass is constant with redshift , a decrease in unequal - mass mergers reflects a decrease in the population of larger haloes .",
    "the press - schechter mass function implies that the largest halo that is common at a given redshift is given by the function @xmath85 , which is defined by the relation @xmath86 . when @xmath87 , the exponential term in equation ( [ psn ] ) dominates , and the number density of such halos is exponentially suppressed .",

    "the bkh merger kernel is less than both eps kernels when the masses of the merging haloes are similar , and the difference increases as the haloes get smaller . for mergers between haloes with mass ratios greater than @xmath83 ,",
    "the bkh merger kernel is nearly equal to the eps kernel with the least - massive halo as the first argument ( @xmath64 ) for all masses .",
    "therefore , for an @xmath133 power - law power - spectrum , @xmath64 comes closer to solving the coagulation equation than @xmath63 .",
    "since the bkh merger kernels for haloes of nearly equal masses are smaller than the eps kernels for the same spectral index , applying eps merger theory may over - estimate the lisa event rate .",
    "figure [ fig : plscrin ] shows the rate @xmath71 of smbh mergers per comoving volume for the power - law model discussed in the previous section . for comparison , the eps results for a @xmath0cdm universe are also shown as dotted curves ( these are the arithmetic means of the corresponding solid and dashed curves in figure [ fig : scrinmbh ] ) . however , it is important to remember that although the power - law models may accurately approximate the @xmath0cdm results in the eps theory , the same should not be assumed for the bkh merger rates .",
    "the bkh merger rates should only be compared to the eps rates for the same power law .",
    "the discrepancy between the power - law eps results and the @xmath0cdm curves at high redshifts is attributable to the power - law halo number density , which is much greater than the @xmath0cdm halo number density for masses below @xmath134 at these redshifts .",
    "the same mass function is used to calculate the merger rate in bkh theory , so when the power - law merger rate is higher than the @xmath0cdm rate in eps theory , it is reasonable to assume that the same is true for the rate derived from bkh theory .",
    "figure [ fig : plscrin ] also shows that the predictions for the smbh merger rate from the bkh and eps merger theories diverge with increasing redshift . in section [",
    "sec : epsresults ] , we showed that as redshift increases , nearly equal - mass halo mergers dominate the event rate .",
    "the differences between the bkh merger kernel and the eps kernel are greatest when the masses of the merging haloes are nearly equal , so as these mergers dominate the event rate at high redshifts , the bkh and eps merger rates diverge .",
    "figure [ fig : plgwe ] illustrates the potential consequences bkh merger theory has for the smbh merger event rate observed by lisa .",
    "the difference between the bkh and eps merger kernels for the same spectral index leads to a fairly substantial difference in the resulting event rates for lisa . for realistic values of the maximum redshift of a detectable merger ( @xmath135 ) ,",
    "the eps prediction is about thirty percent higher than the bkh prediction for the @xmath133 power - law approximation .",
    "if the bkh merger kernel for a full @xmath0cdm power spectrum preserves the ratio of the bks and eps event rates for this spectral index , the lisa event rate from smbh mergers would be reduced as well .",
    "@xcite used eps merger theory to predict that lisa will have approximately 15 smbh - merger detections per year at a signal to noise greater than five ( they only consider mergers with @xmath81 ) .",
    "these comparisons of eps and bkh event rates indicate that lisa s event rate may be closer to ten , with all other assumptions held fixed .",
    "the eps merger theory used to predict supermassive - black - hole merger rates is mathematically inconsistent because it contains two merger rates for the same pair of haloes . when the eps formalism is used to derive supermassive - black - hole merger rates and the corresponding event rate for lisa , there are two potential results",
    "; the eps predictions are ambiguous .",
    "we have found that mergers between haloes whose masses differ by less than a factor of @xmath83 dominate the smbh merger rate , even when all mergers between smbh - containing haloes are included .",
    "the difference between the eps merger rates for mass ratios in this range is small , so the two merger rates predicted by eps theory are nearly equal .",
    "the concordance between the two eps predictions for the smbh merger rate is an artifact of the relative paucity of haloes with masses larger than @xmath134 .",
    "it is not an indication that the eps merger formalism may be trusted to give realistic merger rates .",
    "in addition to its mass - asymmetry , the lacey  cole merger rate fails to give the same evolution of the halo population as the time derivative of the press ",
    "schechter mass function .",
    "both of these flaws justify the search for a new theory of halo mergers .",
    "@xcite ( bkh ) inverted the coagulation equation to find merger rates that preserve the press ",
    "schechter halo mass function for power - law power spectra .",
    "they found that these merger rates differ significantly from the eps rates for the same power spectrum .",
    "the limited range of halo masses that contribute to the smbh merger rate makes it possible to find a power - law power spectrum that accurately fits the mass variance @xmath95 in this region .",
    "we consider such a power - law approximation with spectral index @xmath133 .",
    "since the eps merger formula depends only on the values of @xmath95 for the two halo masses that are merging and the mass of the resulting halo , the power - law approximation accurately describes the result obtained from the @xmath0cdm power spectrum .",
    "the same correspondence can not be assumed for the bkh merger rates because they are dependent on @xmath95 at all masses .",
    "nevertheless , it is illuminating to compare the smbh merger rates derived from bkh merger theory to those derived from eps theory for the same spectral index .",
    "when @xmath133 , the bkh merger rates are lower than the corresponding eps rates for nearly equal - mass halo mergers , which dominate the rate of smbh mergers .",
    "this discrepancy is a clear demonstration of how the eps rates fail to solve the coagulation equation and therefore fail to preserve the ps halo mass function .",
    "it also indicates how bkh theory may predict a different smbh - merger event rate for lisa , since the difference in merger rates results in an equally large difference in event rates . comparing the event rates derived from eps and bkh merger theories for this spectral index",
    "indicates that the lisa event - rate predictions that employ eps merger theory may over - estimate the event rate by thirty percent .",
    "fortunately , the ambiguity carried into the smbh - merger event - rate predictions for lisa from the uncertainty surrounding halo merger theory does not appear to immediately preclude extracting information regarding reionization or black - hole formation from lisa s observations of smbh mergers .",
    "@xcite showed that the lisa smbh - merger event rate with reionization occurring at @xmath136 is about 2.4 times higher than if reionization occurred earlier , at @xmath137 .",
    "this difference is larger than the uncertainties in the event rate revealed by our comparisons of bkh and eps predictions , so it may be possible to constrain the reionization redshift from the lisa smbh - merger event rate without a definitive theory of halo mergers .",
    "the thirty - percent uncertainty implied by these halo - merger - theory comparisons is also less than the difference in event rates for different smbh seeding found by @xcite .",
    "however , a thirty - percent uncertainty in the smbh - merger rate will significantly loosen the constraints lisa s observations of smbh mergers could place on reionization and smbh formation .",
    "more concerning is the fact that there is no guarantee that the merger rate derived from the merger kernel that satisfies the coagulation equation for a @xmath0cdm universe does not differ from the eps merger rate by more than thirty percent .",
    "clearly , solving the coagulation equation for a @xmath0cdm power spectrum is imperative .",
    "any application of extended press ",
    "schechter merger theory to astrophysical phenomena has a flawed foundation and the resulting predictions are unreliable .",
    "specifically , we have shown that the differences between eps merger theory and bkh merger theory for power - law power spectra indicate that switching merger theories could significantly alter the lisa smbh - merger event rate .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty should be resolved before lisa s measurements of smbh merger rates are used to constrain cosmological models .",
