    "in recent years there has been a revived interest in theories having a greater number of spatial dimensions than the three that are observed .",
    "in contrast to the original kaluza - klein theories of extra dimensions , the recent incarnations of extra dimensional theories allow the extra dimensions to be large and even infinite in size ( in the original kaluza - klein theories the extra dimensions were curled up or compactified to the experimentally unobservable small size of the planck length : @xmath0 cm ) .",
    "these new extra dimensional theories have opened up new avenues to explaining some of the open questions in particle physics ( the hierarchy problem , nature of the electro - weak symmetry breaking , explanation of the family structure ) and astrophysics ( the nature of dark matter , the nature of dark energy ) @xcite - @xcite .",
    "in addition they predict new experimentally measurable phenomenon in high precision gravity experiments , particle accelerators , and in astronomical observations .",
    "most of the brane world models use infinitely thin branes with delta - like localization of matter . however these models are generally regarded as an approximation since any fundamental underlying theory , such as quantum gravity or string theory , must contain a fundamental length beyond which a classical space - time description is impossible .",
    "it is therefore necessary to justify the infinitely thin brane approximation as a well - defined limit of a smooth structure  a thick brane  obtainable as a solution to coupled gravitational and matter field equations .",
    "one early example of a thick brane comes from the 5 dimensional model considered in @xcite where one had a topologically non - trivial field configuration for the scalar field .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the picture is presented that our universe is a dynamically localized 3-brane in a higher dimensional space (  brane world  ) . as an example , the dynamics of the nielsen - olesen vortex type in six dimensional spacetime is adopted to localize our space - time within a 3-brane . at low energies , everything is trapped in the 3-brane , and the einstein gravity is induced through the fluctuations of the 3-brane .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to formulate some general requirements on the brane world design leading to the appearance of stable , thick branes having a well - defined zero thickness limit and able to trap ordinary matter . taking a physically reasonable stress - energy tensor it was shown that in 6 dimensions @xcite and also higher extra dimensions @xcite one can trap all the standard model fields using gravity alone .    in ref",
    "s @xcite thick brane world models are studied as @xmath1-symmetric domain walls supported by a scalar field with an arbitrary potential @xmath2 in 5d general relativity and it was shown that in the framework of 5d gravity , a globally regular thick brane always has an anti - de sitter asymptotic and is only possible if the scalar field potential @xmath2 has an alternating sign .    in ref s @xcite - @xcite some properties of brane models was investigated : localization of gravity , graviton ground state , stability and so on .    in ref .",

    "@xcite it is shown that two interacting non - gravitating scalar fields with a non - trivial potential may have a regular spherically symmetric solution .",
    "this solution shows that one can avoid the derrick s theorem @xcite forbidding the existence of regular static solution in the spacetime with the dimension greater 2 for scalar fields if the potential has a local minimum besides global one .",
    "this result allows us to assume that the inclusion of gravitation may not destroy the regularity of similar solutions in 5d spacetime . in ref .",

    "we consider 5d gravity + two interacting fields .",
    "the key for the existence of a regular solution here is that the scalar fields potential have to have _ local _ and _ global _ minima , and at the infinity the scalar fields tend to a local but _ not _ to global minimum .",
