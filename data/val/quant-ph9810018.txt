    "the development of reliable sources of nonclassical light has been of particular interest .",
    "promising candidates for such sources have been nonlinear optical elements converting coherent light produced by lasers into nonclassical light .    since nonclassical properties are always in competition with the noise associated with unavoidable losses , a quantum theoretical description is required that necessarily includes absorption .",
    "numerous approaches to the problem of quantization of radiation in absorbing media have been made ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in most quantization schemes the influence of absorption has been omitted .",
    "concepts have been developed for both dispersionless and ( weakly ) dispersive media @xcite .",
    "formulations in which the medium is introduced macroscopically via a constant ( i.e. , frequency - independent ) permittivity may run into problems when dispersion is present @xcite .",

    "recently , the method of quantization via green - function expansion @xcite , which is closely related to the ( mesoscopic ) diagonalization scheme considered in @xcite , has been extended to arbitrary linear media , i.e. , arbitrarily space - dependent , kramers - kronig consistent permittivities @xcite .",
    "an extension of this approach to nonlinear , absorbing media has been given in @xcite . an interesting attempt to treat the problem of quantization of radiation in dielectric media composed of two - level atoms has been considered in @xcite .    in this article",
    "the propagation of quantum solitons in absorbing nonlinear wave guides is studied .",

    ", the radiation can be well localized in space and time by forming solitonlike pulses .",
    "the stability of classical solitons in a lossless medium is based on the balance between anomalous group velocity dispersion and kerr - induced self - phase modulation @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of quantum solitons usually starts from a hamiltonian , the classical form of which leads to the classical ( optical ) nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the quantum nonlinear schrdinger equation ( qnlse ) can be solved by means of the bethe ansatz @xcite . in practice , however , the qnlse must be supplemented with further terms in order to describe effects such as absorption , third - order dispersion , and raman scattering .",

    "is used in order to derive an infinite set of evolution equations for the cumulant hierarchy associated with a chosen phase - space function . introducing appropriate truncation , the resulting finite set of ordinary differential equations",
