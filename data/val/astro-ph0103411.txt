    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is one of the most important tools to probe the early universe because it is sensitive to the condition of the universe from @xmath2 sec to @xmath3 sec .",
    "therefore , from the theoretical predictions we can indirectly check the history of the universe in such an early epoch and impose constraints on hypothetical particles by observational light element abundances .",
    "now we have a lot of models of modern particle physics beyond the standard model , e.g. , supergravity or superstring theory , which predict unstable massive particles with masses of @xmath4(100 ) gev ",
    "@xmath4(10 ) tev , such as the gravitino , polonyi field , and moduli .",
    "they have long lifetimes because their interactions are suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these exotic particles may necessarily decay at about the bbn epoch ( @xmath6 mev ) if they have already existed in earlier stages .",
    "if the massive particles radiatively decay , the emitted high energy photons induce the electromagnetic cascade process .",
    "if the decay occurs after bbn starts @xmath7 , the light elements would be destroyed by the cascade photons and their abundances would be changed significantly . comparing the theoretical prediction of light element abundances with the observations",
    ", we can impose constrains on the energy density , the mass , and the lifetime of the parent massive particle  @xcite .",
    "this subject was also studied in more details in the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the massive particles decay into quarks or gluons , near the bbn epoch @xmath8 .",
    "it is expected that the other important effects are induced .",
    "if once the high energy quarks or gluons are emitted , they quickly fragment into a lot of hadrons .",
    "then , such high energy hadrons are injected into the electromagnetic thermal bath which is constituted by photons , electrons , and nucleons ( protons and nucleons ) at that time . at first , the high energy hadrons scatter off the background photons and electrons because they are more abundant than the background nucleons .",
    "then , almost all kinetic energy of the hadrons are transfered into the thermal bath through the electromagnetic interaction . as a result , they are completely stopped and reach to the kinetic equilibrium . after that time , they scatter off the background @xmath9 or @xmath10 through the strong interaction , and they inter - convert the background @xmath9 and @xmath10 each other even after the usual freeze - out time of the neutron to proton ratio @xmath11 of the weak interaction .",
    "the effect extraordinarily tends to increase @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the produced @xmath12 would be increased in the hadron injection scenario compared to standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) .",
    "the pioneering investigation of this subject was done by reno and seckel ( 1988 )  @xcite , and their treatments have been also applied to the other subjects  @xcite .",
    "after their work was published , the experiments of the high energy physics have been widely developed .",
    "now we can obtain a lot of experimental informations of the hadron fragmentation in the high energy region and also simulate the process even in the higher energies where we have no experimental data by executing the numerical code of the hadron fragmentation , e.g. jetset 7.4 monte carlo event generator  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have more experimental data of the hadron - nucleon cross sections .",
    "concerning bbn computations , it is recently needed that we perform a monte carlo simulation which includes the experimental errors of the reactions , and then we estimate the confidence levels ( c.l . ) by performing the maximum likelihood analysis and the @xmath13 fitting including both the theoretical and the observational errors . performing the above procedures",

    ", we set bounds to the hadronic decay of long - lived particles .",

    "ii we briefly review the current status of the observations and sbbn . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the formulations and computations in the hadron injection scenario . in sec .",

    "recently a new deuterium data was obtained from observation of qso hs 0105 + 1619 at z = 2.536  @xcite .",
    "the reported value of the deuterium abundance was relatively low , ( d / h)@xmath14 .",
    "combined with the previous `` low d '' data  @xcite , the authors reported that the primordial abundance is @xmath15 we call this value `` low d. '' on the other hand , webb et al . obtained high deuterium abundance in relatively low redshift absorption systems at z = 0.701 towards qso pg1718 + 4807  @xcite , @xmath16 in these days , kirkman et al .",
    "@xcite also observed the clouds independently and obtained new spectra using hst .",
    "they claimed that the absorption was not deuterium although there were still some uncertainties .",
    "here we think that it is premature to decide which component is correctly primordial and the possibility of `` high d '' have not been excluded yet .",
    "therefore , we also consider the possibility of `` high d '' and include it in our analysis .",
    "the primordial value of @xmath17he is inferred from the recombination lines from the low metallicity extragalactic hii regions .",
    "the primordial value of @xmath17he mass fraction @xmath18 is obtained to regress to the zero metallicity o / h @xmath19 for the observational data because it is produced with oxygen in stars . in these days fields and olive reanalyzed the data including the hei absorption effect  @xcite .",

    "22 reactions are relevant to the primordial nucleosynthesis , and the old data were revised .",
    "in particular , 7 reactions of them are important for the most elementary processes up to mass-7 elements . on the other hand , recently cyburt , fields and olive reanalyzed the nacre data and properly derived the @xmath27 uncertainty as a statistical meaning and the renormalization of the center value for each reaction  @xcite .",

    "in this section , we discuss the hadron - injection effects on the history of the universe near bbn epoch ( @xmath47  @xmath48 sec ) . here",
    "we consider the case that the unstable massive particle `` @xmath49 '' has some decay modes into quarks and gluons , and as a result it induces the late - time hadron injection .",
    "if the quarks and gluons were emitted by the decay of the parent particle @xmath49 whose mass is about @xmath50 gev ",
    "@xmath51 tev , they immediately fragment into hadron jets and produce a lot of mesons and baryons ( @xmath52 , and so on ) .",
    "then , the typical energy of the produced hadrons is about @xmath53  @xmath54 , and they are injected into the electromagnetic thermal bath which is constituted by @xmath55 , and nucleons .",
    "as we see later , if once such high energy hadrons are injected into the thermal bath in the beginning of the bbn epoch ( i.e. , at the temperature @xmath56 mev ) , their almost all kinetic energy is transfered into the thermal bath through the electromagnetic interactions except for neutral kaons .",
    "then , such hadrons scatter off the background particles , and then they induce some non - standard effects on bbn .",
    "especially , the emitted hadrons extraordinarily inter - convert the ambient protons and neutrons each other through the strong interaction even after the freeze - out time of the neutron to proton ratio @xmath11 . for the relatively short lifetime ( @xmath57  @xmath1 ) in which we are interested , the above effect induces the significant change in the produced light elements .",
    "concretely , protons which are more abundant than neutrons , are changed into neutrons through the hadron - proton collisions and the ratio @xmath11 increases extremely . in this case",
    ", the late - time hadron injection scenario tends to increase @xmath12 because it is the most sensitive to the freeze out value of @xmath11 ,    the emitted hadrons do not scatter off the background nucleons directly . at first hadrons scatter off the background photons and electrons because they are much more abundant than background nucleons ( about 10@xmath58 times larger ) .",
    "as we see later , for @xmath59 , the emitted high energy hadrons are immediately thermalized through the electromagnetic scattering and they reach to the kinetic equilibrium before they interact with the ambient protons , neutrons and light elements .",
    "then we use the thermal - averaged cross section @xmath60 for the strong interaction process @xmath61 between hadron @xmath62 and the ambient nucleon @xmath63 , where @xmath63 denotes proton @xmath9 or neutron @xmath10 .",
    "the strong interaction rate is estimated by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number density of the nucleon species @xmath63 , @xmath66 is the baryon to photon ratio ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath36 denotes the baryon number density ( @xmath68 ) , and @xmath69 is the nucleon fraction ( @xmath70 ) . here ,",
    "for the moment we adopt 40 mb as a typical value of the cross section for the strong interaction .",
    "this equation shows that every hadron whose lifetime is longer than @xmath71 sec contributes to the inter - converting interaction between neutron and proton at the beginning of bbn .",
    "hereafter we will consider only the long - lived mesons ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ) and baryons ( @xmath9 , @xmath75 , @xmath10 , and @xmath76 ) .  , and @xmath77 have much shorter lifetimes and they have completely finished to decay because their lifetimes are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 sec respectively .",
    "therefore , they do not contribute to the interesting process in this situation . ]",
    "their lifetimes are given by  @xcite @xmath81 and proton is stable .",
    "here we define the stopping time @xmath82 of the high energy particle @xmath62 in the thermal plasma as @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the energy , @xmath85 denotes the energy loss rate in the thermal plasma and it depends on the each scattering process of particle @xmath62 off the background particles .",
    "@xmath86 is the initial energy , and @xmath87 is the threshold energy of the process .   to be equal to the mass of the particle @xmath62 in the relativistic regime . ] to estimate whether particle @xmath62 is stopped or not in the thermal plasma through the electromagnetic interaction until it scatter off the background baryons ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and produced light elements ) , we computes the rate , @xmath88 as an indicator which roughly represents the number of the scattering during the stopping time @xmath82 . if @xmath89 is much less than unity , the emitted high energy hadron @xmath62 is completely stopped and can not reach the background baryons with the high energy .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath90 is greater than unity , the high energy hadron can not be stopped through the electromagnetic interaction and directly scatters off the background baryons .",
    "in addition , it might destroy the light elements which have already produced if the particle @xmath49 decays after the cosmic time is @xmath91 sec .",
    "when the cosmic temperature @xmath92 is higher than the electron mass @xmath93 , there are sufficient electrons and positrons in the universe . in this situation",
    ", it is expected that the emitted charged particles @xmath94 , and @xmath9 are quickly thermalized through the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "in fact , the energy loss rate of the charged particle through the coulomb scattering is given by @xmath95 for @xmath96 in the relativistic regime .",
    "@xmath97 is fine structure constant ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "then , the stopping time of the charged particle ( `` ch '' ) is estimated by @xmath99 for @xmath96 . then , @xmath100 is much smaller than unity and we can regard that charged hadrons are completely stopped .    as for neutron , we can see that it is also completely stopped for @xmath101 .",
    "although neutron is neutral , of course , it can scatter off the background electrons through the electromagnetic interaction by the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the energy loss rate through the coulomb scattering is given by @xmath102 in the relativistic regime , where @xmath103 is neutron magnetic moment (= @xmath104 )  @xcite , and @xmath105 is neutron mass .",
    "the stopping time of neutron is @xmath106 thus @xmath107 of neutron is much smaller than unity , and it does not scatter off the background baryons before it stops for @xmath101 .   on the other hand , if the temperature is much lower than electron mass ( @xmath108 ) , the situation is quite different because the number density of electrons becomes little .",
    "in this case , the emitted mesons completely decay and disappear in the universe before they scatter off the background baryons because the lifetime is shorter than the timescale of the strong interaction ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma^i_nn ] ) ) .",
    "thus we should not treat the injection of any mesons in such a late epoch . because proton is stable , and",
    "neutron has a long lifetime compared to the typical timescale of the strong interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma^i_nn ] ) , we should worry about the thermalization of the emitted high - energy nucleons till quite later .",
    "for proton , the ionization loss is more effective to lose the relativistic energy for @xmath108 .",
    "the ionization - loss rate is expressed by @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the charge ( @xmath111 for proton ) , @xmath112 is the velocity of the high energy proton , @xmath113 is the lorentz factor , @xmath114 is @xmath4(1 ) constant , and @xmath115 denotes the plasma frequency , @xmath116 where @xmath117 represents the electron number density .",
    "we evaluate the stopping time of the proton to lose its relativistic energy , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is defined by @xmath120 , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath121 .",
    "if we demand @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath123 which corresponds to cosmic time @xmath124 sec .",
    "namely after @xmath125 sec , such a high energy proton can not be stopped in the thermal bath , and it is inevitable to scatter off the ambient baryons with the high energy .    as well as the high energy proton , we estimate the case of the high energy neutron .",
    "the energy loss rate of the neutron through the coulomb scattering for @xmath108 is @xmath126 the stopping time to lose the relativistic energy is @xmath127 here if we require @xmath128 , we find that the temperature should be greater than 95 kev for the neutron stopping which corresponds to the condition that cosmic time should be shorter than 150 sec . in this case , after @xmath129 150 sec , the high energy neutron essentially inevitably scatters off the background baryons before it stops . under these situations , at longest , after @xmath129 150 sec the high energy nucleons necessarily scatter off the ambient baryons through the strong interaction , and we would also have to worry about the possibilities of the destruction of the light elements .",
    "this means that the scattering process after @xmath129 150 sec is beyond the limits of validity in our treatment in this paper . for the problem",
    ", we will discuss it later .",
    "as for @xmath130 , it is never stopped in the electromagnetic plasma because it does not interact with electrons and photons .",
    "therefore , by using the energy dependent cross sections we will treat the scattering off the ambient nucleons . to perform the computation , we should know the correct energy distribution of @xmath130 produced through the hadron fragmentation .",
    "on the other hand , for relatively longer lifetimes @xmath131 , there is another interesting effects on bbn .",
    "the emitted photons or charged leptons induce the electro - magnetic cascade showers and produce many soft photons .  )",
    ", the almost all parts of the energy of the parent particle are transfered into photons and electrons because the hadrons decay after they completely transfer their relativistic energy into the thermal bath .",
    "in addition , it is expected that about 1/3 parts of the produced hadrons are approximately @xmath132 and they decay as @xmath133 with a much shorter lifetime ( @xmath134).]their spectrum has a cutoff at @xmath135 . if @xmath136 exceeds the binding energies of the light elements , these photons destroy the light elements and change their abundances  @xcite .",
    "in fact , at @xmath137 , the energy of the photon spectrum which are produced by the decay of @xmath49 , exceeds the deuterium ( @xmath17he ) binding energy @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) mev .",
    "however , because we are not interested in the photodissociation here , we only study the case of @xmath140 .",
    "as an example of the hadronic decay , if the gravitino @xmath141 is the parent particle @xmath49 whose mass is @xmath142(1 ) tev , it can have net hadronic decay modes , e.g. , @xmath143 ( @xmath144 : quark ) , with the branching ratio @xmath145 . in this case",
    ", @xmath145 can become @xmath146(@xmath97 ) at least even if the main decay mode is only @xmath147 ( @xmath148 : photino ) , because of the electromagnetic coupling of the photon .",
    "as we quantitatively show later , about 1 hadrons are produced for @xmath149 and for the energy per two hadron jets , @xmath150 , if we assume that the mechanism of the hadron fragmentation is similar to the @xmath151 collider experiments .",
    "in addition , the emitted high energy photon whose energy is about @xmath152 scatters off the background photon @xmath153 and can produce a quark - antiquark pair .  .",
    "thus , the net branching ratio into hadrons is about @xmath154 in this energy.]then , the center of mass energy is about @xmath155 2 gev and produces about 3 hadrons which could effectively contribute to the decay mode into hadrons as the branching ratio @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , we should consider the hadronic decay modes at least as @xmath157 in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "if the decay mode @xmath158 ( @xmath159 : gluon , and @xmath160 : gluino ) is kinematically allowed , @xmath145 may become close to one .",
    "for the other candidate of the parent particle , polonyi field or moduli , which appears in supergravity or superstring theory and has a @xmath161 mass , would also have a hadronic decay mode ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "fortunately , we can estimate the number and energy distribution of the produced hadrons by using the jetset 7.4 monte carlo event generator  @xcite .",
    "this fortran package computes the hadron fragmentation for the @xmath163 event ( @xmath144 : quark ) in the @xmath151 annihilation and predicts the energy distribution of the products to agree with the @xmath151 collider experiments . in fig .",

    ", such a low energy hadron can not destroy the background @xmath12 .",
    "concerning exothermic reactions , it is well - known that the cross section @xmath31 is nearly inversely proportional to the velocity @xmath112 of the projectile particle in the low energy .",

    "now we assume that the cross section of the inter - converting reaction @xmath219 is obtained by @xmath220 $ ] because the final states of the inelastic scattering without @xmath221 are @xmath222 , @xmath223 , or @xmath224 , and it is approximately expected that either @xmath9 or @xmath10 appears in a closely even probability .  , @xmath225 ; @xmath226 ; @xmath227 , @xmath228 ; @xmath229  @xcite .",

    "the theoretical reason is that the strong interaction does not distinguish between proton and neutron in such a high energy . under these circumstances ,",
    "we assume that the cross section of @xmath233 is as same as @xmath215 with a few tens percent error .    to perform the numerical computations including the @xmath130-injection effects in bbn , it is useful to average the cross sections by the energy spectrum of @xmath130 . as we discussed in the previous subsection",
    ", we can use the jetset 7.4 monte carlo generator and get the energy spectrum of emitted @xmath130 in wide range of the source energy .",
    "for example , we can see the spectrum of the produced @xmath130 for various energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndx ] .",
    "then , we get the averaged cross sections , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , as the convolutions of the data of the cross sections with the energy spectrum of @xmath130 ( fig .  [ fig : sigave ] ) .    concerning the emitted nucleons , we basically follow the reno and seckel s treatment that we regard the nucleon - antinucleon pair as a kind of a meson @xmath236  @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath236 meson induces the inter - conversion @xmath237 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have the thermally - averaged cross sections , @xmath238 as we discussed in the previous sections , however , the late time emission of the high energy nucleons would induce the destruction of light elements for @xmath239 .",
    "however , for the moment we treat the nucleons as if they are approximately thermalized .",
    "we will also discuss the modification on the result caused by the above simple assumption later .",
    "we formulate the time evolution equations in the late - time hadron - injection scenario here .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous subsections , the hadron injection at the beginning of bbn enhances the inter - converting interactions between neutron and proton equally and the freeze out value of @xmath11 is extremely increased .",
    "then the time evolution equations for the number density of a nucleon @xmath240 is represented by @xmath241_{\\rm weak } - b_h \\gamma_x n_x \\left (         k_{n \\rightarrow n ' } - k_{n ' \\rightarrow n } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath242 is hubble expansion rate , @xmath243_{\\rm weak}$ ] denotes the contribution from the usual weak interaction rates as well as sbbn , @xmath145 is the branching ratio of the hadronic decay mode of @xmath49 , @xmath244 is the number density of @xmath49 , @xmath245 denotes the average number of the transition @xmath246 per one @xmath49 decay .",
    "the average number of the transition @xmath246 per one @xmath49 decay is expressed by @xmath247 where @xmath62 runs the hadron species which are relevant to the nucleon inter - converting reactions , @xmath248 is the number of the hadron jet per one x decay , @xmath249 denotes the average number of the emitted hadron species @xmath62 per one @xmath49 decay .",

    "[ fig : kinave ] , @xmath258 is plotted as a function of @xmath250 .",
    "in this section we perform the bbn computations in the hadron - injection scenario .",

    "the above choice of a set of model parameters @xmath166 and @xmath248 is not unique in general and is obviously model dependent . for @xmath166 however , since we study the wide range of the mass , we can read off the results by rescaling the mass parameter .",
    "in addition , for the modification of @xmath248 since the second term in the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ eq : difeqn ] ) scales as @xmath261 , we only translate the obtained results according to the above scaling rule and push the responsibility off onto the number density @xmath244 .    as we noted in the previous sections ,",
    "it is a remarkable feature that the predicted @xmath12 mass fraction @xmath18 tends to increase in the hadron injection scenario because @xmath12 is the most sensitive to the freeze - out value of the neutron to proton ratio in the beginning of bbn .",
    "since protons which are more abundant than neutrons are changed into neutrons through the strong interactions rapidly , the freeze out value of @xmath11 increase extremely if once the net hadrons are emitted .",
    "in addition , d is also sensitive to the neutron number after @xmath262 because the free neutrons can not burn into @xmath12 .    to see the rough tendency , we plot the upper bounds for @xmath263 in fig .

    "however , you can easily find that these constraints are obtained only when @xmath66 is fixed .",
    "if we chose the other @xmath66 , e.g. which predicts more d / h than the upper bound of the observation in sbbn , then , the almost all parameter regions would have been excluded because both d and @xmath12 tend to increase in the hadron - injection scenario .",
    "namely , any constraints , which are obtained when we fix @xmath66 _ a priori _ , have little meaning . to correctly compare each model in the various parameters ( @xmath66 , @xmath265 , and @xmath271 )",
    ", we should perform the maximum likelihood analysis and the @xmath13 fitting in wide parameter region including both the observational and theoretical errors . to estimate the theoretical errors",
    ", we perform the monte carlo simulation including the theoretical uncertainties which come from experimental errors of nuclear reaction and hadron - nucleon reaction rates .    concerning the detail of the executions , we have already explained in  [ subsec : sbbn ] . for the hadron - nucleon interaction rate , we adopt 50@xmath38 error for each cross section because there are not any adequate experimental data for the uncertainties of cross sections .",
    "therefore , we take the larger errors to get a conservative bound here .    in fig .",

    "the region below the line is allowed by the observations ( @xmath12 , d , and @xmath25 ) for the various mass of @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath275 becomes heavier , more hadrons are emitted in the decay , and the upper bound becomes more stringent . comparing the case of @xmath275 = 100 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowd ] with that in fig .",
    "[ fig : non_mc ] , the upper bound obtained in the monte carlo simulation is milder .",
    "that is because we did not adopt the naive 2@xmath31 observational upper bounds with fixed @xmath66 , but we searched the wide range of @xmath66 , not forgetting @xmath265 and @xmath271 , and we performed the maximum likelihood analysis to include both all the observational and theoretical uncertainties . in fig .",
    "[ fig : highd ] we also plot the results of high d. compared to the case of low d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowd ] ) , the obtained upper bound becomes milder because more d are allowed by the observations in high d case .",
    "as we also discussed in the previous section , the above treatment might underestimate the deuterium abundance for @xmath276 because deuterium is produced by the destruction of @xmath17he by the high - energy free neutrons in such a relatively late epoch .",
    "therefore , that means we obtained the conservative limits only for longer lifetime than 150 sec in this paper .    here",
    "we consider one of the concrete models of the hadronic decay .",
    "if we assume that the parent massive particle is gravitino and that it mainly decays into a photon and a photino ( @xmath277 ) , the lifetime @xmath278 is related to the gravitino mass @xmath279 as @xmath280 in addition , if we assume that the gravitino is produced through the thermal scattering in the reheating process after inflation , we relate the abundance @xmath281 of the gravitino with the reheating temperature @xmath282  @xcite , @xmath283 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_tr ] we plot the upper bound on the reheating temperature after inflation at 95@xmath38 c.l . as a function of the gravitino mass @xmath279 .",
    "the solid line ( dashed line ) denotes the case of low d ( high d ) .",
    "the region below the line is allowed by the observations . as we discussed before , @xmath145 can become @xmath284(@xmath97 ) at least even if the main decay mode is only photons , because photon has the electromagnetic coupling with @xmath285 , i.e. ( @xmath145 = 0.01  1 ) .",
    "for @xmath286 , they mean the conservative upper bound .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the effects of the late - time hadron injection on the primordial nucleosynthesis which are caused by the decay of an unstable massive particle @xmath49 when the lifetime is relatively short @xmath287 .",
    "if the massive particle decays into quarks or gluons , they quickly fragment into hadrons .",
    "then the high energy hadrons would be emitted into the electromagnetic thermal bath near the bbn epoch . because the background photons and electrons are sufficiently energetic in the epoch , such high energy hadrons lose their almost all kinetic energies through the electromagnetic interaction , and they are approximately stopped before they interact with the background nucleons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) except for neutral kaon @xmath187 .",
    "then , they scatter off the background nucleons by the threshold cross sections only for the exothermic reactions and can extraordinarily inter - convert @xmath9 and @xmath10 each other strongly through the hadron - nucleon interaction even after the freeze - out time of the neutron to proton ratio @xmath11 . at that time",
    "it is expected that the background proton tends to be changed into neutron through the strong interaction since protons are more abundant than neutrons , and @xmath11 tends to increase . as a result ,",
    "in particular , the abundance of @xmath12 extraordinarily increases because it is the most sensitive to the freeze out value of @xmath11 .",
    "then , we can constrain the abundance of @xmath49 and obtain the informations of @xmath265 from the observational light element abundances .    here",
    "we have studied the hadron injections by using the jetset 7.4 monte carlo event generator  @xcite to quantitatively understand the hadron jets to agree with the collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the treatments , we can estimate the number of the emitted hadrons as a function of the energy of jets , i.e. as a function of the mass of @xmath49 , even in the regions where there is no experimental data .",
    "in addition we can also obtain the energy spectrum of the emitted @xmath130 for various masses of @xmath49 .",
    "this is very important in the computations because @xmath130 is never stopped in the electromagnetic plasma , and we should know the energy distributions of @xmath130 s . on the other hand ,",
    "we also have estimated the energy - dependent cross sections for @xmath130-nucleon scattering using the existing experimental data  @xcite . with these data",
    ", we could properly include the hadron - injection effects in bbn computations .    to estimate the theoretical errors",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulation including the theoretical uncertainties which come from those of the elementary nuclear reaction rates and hadron - nucleon interaction rates . to obtain the degree of agreements between theory and observation",
    ", we performed the maximum likelihood method and the @xmath13 fitting including both the observational and theoretical errors . to correctly compare each model in the various parameters ( @xmath66 , @xmath265 , and @xmath271 )",
    ", the above procedure is quite crucial because a constraint which is obtained when we intentionally fix the parameters has little meaning .    as a result",
    ", we have obtained the upper bound on the abundance @xmath271 as a function of the lifetime @xmath265 to agree with the observations for the wide range of the mass @xmath288 10 gev  100 tev which are relevant for various models of supergravity or superstring theory .",
    "however , we might have underestimated the deuterium abundances where the lifetime is longer than @xmath289 because deuterium can be produced by the destruction of @xmath17he by the high - energy free neutrons , i.e. `` hadro - dissociation '' effects which we ignored in this work . therefore , if the process is effective , that would mean we obtained the conservative upper bounds only for @xmath290 . in the separate paper , we will comprehensively study the subject  @xcite .",
    "we have also applied the results obtained by a generic hadronic decaying particle to gravitino @xmath291 .",
    "then we have got the upper bound on the reheating temperature after primordial inflation as a function of the mass , @xmath292 ( @xmath293 ) for @xmath294 at 95 @xmath38 c.l . in the case of low d ( high d ) .",
