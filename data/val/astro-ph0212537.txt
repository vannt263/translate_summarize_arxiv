    "starbursts are an intensive mode of star formation in galaxies ( storchi - bergmann , calzetti & kinney 1994 ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with @xmath4 l@xmath5 are probably the most active and luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "indeed recent iso observations suggest that many ulirgs are powered by starbursts with little contribution from agn ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al . 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "starburst galaxies of lower activity are hii galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies , known as uv - selected starburst galaxies ( uvsbgs ; kinney et al .",
    "1993 ; storch - bergmann et al . 1994 ; calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; mcquade , calzetti & kinney 1995 ; gordon , calzetti & witt 1997 ; takagi , arimoto & vanseviius 1999 ) .",
    "recently , an upper limit of ` bolometric surface brightness ' was given by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a sample of starburst galaxies observed in the rest frame 1 ) uv , 2 ) far infrared ( fir ) and h@xmath6 , and 3 ) 21 cm radio continuum emission .",
    "this limit seems to be physically associated with an instability in gaseous discs ( e.g. toomre 1964 ; quirk 1972 ) as kennicutt ( 1989 ) had already suggested for the star formation in normal disc galaxies . in their study , the effective radii are determined from observations at the different wavelengths for each galaxy . however , if a galaxy is optically thick the observed effective radius strongly depends on the degree of extinction , since the observed light comes out solely from the region in which the optical depth is less than unity",
    ". moreover , many ulirgs have multiple starburst regions ( e.g. scoville et al . 2000 ; surace & sanders 2000 ) , while most of uvsbgs show only one major central starburst region .",
    "these effects suggest that the panchromatic intensity limit on starbursts proposed by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) may not be appropriate for ulirgs .    to determine the intensity limit of starbursts with various levels of activity ranging from uvsbgs to ulirgs",
    ", it is necessary to estimate both star formation rates ( sfrs ) and effective radii in a unified manner , whatever the degree of extinction . while typical @xmath7-band optical depths in uvsbgs are @xmath8 ( takagi , arimoto , & vanseviius 1999 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "1994 ) , those in ulirgs reach @xmath9 ( genzel et al .",
    "such a wide variation in @xmath10 causes a serious problem in deriving sfrs , since none of the currently used sfr indicators , such as h@xmath6 ( or other balmer lines ) , uv continuum , or fir luminosities , are commonly applicable for starbursts ranging from uvsbgs to ulirgs .",
    "the fir luminosity is not a good measure of bolometric luminosity when starburst regions are optically thin , while h@xmath6 luminosity is difficult to use if the mean surface gas density becomes larger than 50 m@xmath11 pc@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath12 , causing a significant extinction at h@xmath6 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "what is worse , by using br@xmath13 and fir luminosities , kennicutt ( 1998 ) has shown that the fir luminosities give systematically higher sfrs ( by a factor of @xmath14 ) than the br@xmath13s .",
    "sullivan et al . ( 2000 ) compared the h@xmath6- and uv - derived sfrs of nearby starbursts to find that starburst galaxies are typically over - luminous in the uv for a given h@xmath6 luminosity .",
    "the effect is strongest in the less luminous galaxies .    when comparing ulirgs and uvsbgs , the bolometric surface brightness should be derived for each individual starburst region in ulirgs .",
    "the wealth of ground - based low - resolution imaging surveys have provided little information on the stars in the starburst region near the confusion limit @xmath15 . even the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) with its higher resolution @xmath16 fails to go deep enough into the starburst regions , which are obscured by dust at optical wavelengths .",
    "the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on _ hst _ can observe the obscured starburst regions more directly at near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths where the effects of dust extinction are reduced significantly compared to visual wavelengths .",
    "scoville et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the morphologies of 24 ulirgs with nicmos and found that light profiles of nine of them were well fit by an @xmath17 law , rather than an exponential profile .",
    "the apparent effective radii of ulirgs tend to be more compact than the extent of gas observed with high - resolution imaging of the co emission ( bryant @xmath18 scoville 1999 ) .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of stars is more concentrated than that of dust and gas in the starburst regions .",
    "thus , the dimming of light due to the surrounding dust can be so large that the real distribution of stars deviates from the apparent distribution of the light even the longest observable wavelength with nicmos of 2.2 @xmath19 m .",
    "it is thus crucial to establish a measure of both sfrs and the spatial distribution of stars which can be applied to starbursts of any optical depth .",
    "clearly , a new recipe to derive both sfrs and the stellar distributions is required to investigate the physical properties of starbursts comprehensively .    in this paper",
    ", we will use spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) to submillimetre ( submm ) to derive sfrs of starburst regions .",
    "the sed from the uv to submm can represent the bolometric luminosity , irrespective of the dust extinction .",
    "we construct an ` evolutionary ' sed model for starburst regions from a simple but realistic point of view .",
    "we show that our sed model can explain a wide variety of seds from optically thin starbursts ( uvsbgs ) to optically thick ones ( ulirgs ) .",
    "it is important to note that our sed model can derive not only the sfr , but also the other starburst properties like the optical depth .",
    "moreover , we can derive the apparent effective radius of starbursts at various wavelengths for a given geometry , since we properly take into account the radiative transfer in a dusty medium .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary stages of starburst galaxies can be investigated in a unified manner for a whole range of activity , which can then be compared with the observations of the sed and the effective radius , directly .",
    "the systematic estimation of the sfrs and the effective radius can give an answer to the question : is the panchromatic limit of starburst intensity reported by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also valid for ulirgs ?    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our evolutionary sed model for starburst galaxies . in section 3 , we summarize the model properties . in section 4 , we apply our model to a sample of uvsbgs and ulirgs in the local universe and describe the resulting properties of nearby starburst galaxies derived from our sed model fitting . sections 5 and 6 give discussions and conclusions , respectively .",
    "we consider a model for the chemical enrichment of a starburst region into which gas is supplied continuously . when a large amount of gas is supplied into the central region of a galaxy , a starburst is triggered .",
    "since the details of the gas supplying mechanism are yet to be investigated , it would not be outrageous to suppose that star formation and chemical evolution in the starburst regions are approximately described by an infall model of chemical evolution ( arimoto , et al .",
    "ubiquitous galactic outflows from the starbursts have been observed with the x - ray emission from the hot gas driving the flow , optical line emission produced by the warm gas , and the interstellar absorption lines ( e.g. heckman et al . 2000 ; lehnert @xmath18 heckman 1996 ) .",
    "heckman et al . ( 2000 ) suggested that most of the outflow gas consists of ambient material which has been mass - loaded into the hot gas .",
    "therefore , we assume that the amount of gas in the outflow from a starburst region has negligible impact on the chemical evolution as a whole .",
    "this is true if the mass loss rate from a starburst region is less than 10% of the sfr . under this simple evolutionary picture ,",
    "a starburst is characterized by the rates of gas infall and star formation .",
    "the time variation of gas mass @xmath20 , total stellar mass @xmath21 , and gas metallicity @xmath22 are given by the equations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the ejection rates of the gas and the metals from dying stars , and the metallicity of the supplied gas , respectively .",
    "we set the initial condition as @xmath27 for all the calculations in this paper .",
    "although some amount of gas and stars unrelated to the starbursts are initially expected in the starburst region , we assume that the amount of initial gas and stars are negligible in both the chemical and photometric evolution of starburst region . for @xmath26 , the star formation history before the starburst event is important .",
    "we will explicitly note the adopted values of @xmath26 later .",
    "we assume @xmath26 is constant during the starburst event .    the sfr @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the star formation time - scale and the gas mass in the starburst region , respectively .",
    "the gas supply rate is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the initial gas mass in the reservoir surrounding the starburst region and the time - scale of gas supply , respectively ( arimoto et al .",
    "physically , the time - scales @xmath34 and @xmath30 can be expressed in terms of the dynamical time , sound - crossing time , and cooling time , depending on what triggers the starburst .",
    "it is however difficult to ascertain the characteristic time - scale of each starburst from observations .",
    "thus , we hereafter analyse the simplest case , in which a starburst is characterized by only one evolutionary time - scale @xmath35 , i.e. , we adopt @xmath36 .    for all cases in this paper",
    ", we adopt the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with the lower and upper mass limit of 0.1 m@xmath11 and 60 m@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "equations ( 1)-(3 ) are numerically solved by using an evolutionary population synthesis code of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "the adopted stellar libraries and evolutionary tracks are the same as those in the original code .",
    "details of nucleosynthesis prescription is given there .",
    "the effect of dust on the seds is significant and predominant in starburst regions . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a simple model in which the dust - to - metal ratio @xmath37 is constant ; i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "as described below ( section 2.3 ) , we use three types of dust model for the milky way ( mw ) , large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc ; smc ) .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath37 for mw , lmc and smc are 0.40 , 0.55 , 0.75 , respectively ( takagi 2001 ) .",
    "starbursts could be the most ideal case for constant @xmath39 , since 1 ) only type ii supernovae contribute to the supernova rate and 2 ) the gas fraction in molecular clouds is large ( see dwek 1998 ) .",
    "we consider a starburst region in which stars and dust are distributed within a radius @xmath40 .",
    "we introduce a mass - radius relation for the starburst region ; @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a compactness factor which expresses the matter concentration ; the mean density becomes higher for smaller @xmath42 .",
    "starburst galaxies are characterized by a large surface brightness , which are roughly constant ( armus , heckman & miley 1990 ; meurer et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) . in the adopted mass - radius relation",
    ", @xmath43 gives the constant surface brightness for constant @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath43 throughout this paper .",
    "a variation in the surface brightness can be expressed by the different values of @xmath42 in our model .",
    "note that not only the surface brightness but also the sed feature is preserved for different values of @xmath44 if @xmath43 , since the source function within the starburst is conserved .",
    "therefore , multiple systems with the total stellar mass of @xmath44 , in which each component has the same surface brightness , have the same sed as that of a unit system with a stellar mass of @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the stellar density distribution @xmath45 is given by a generalized king profile ; @xmath46 ^{-\\beta } , \\label{king}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the stellar density at the centre of starburst region and @xmath48 is a core radius of stars .",
    "we adopt the stellar density distribution of typical elliptical galaxies ; i.e. , the concentration parameter @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( combes et al .",
    "recently , scoville et al . ( 2000 ) and james et al . ( 1999 ) presented @xmath51-band images of starburst galaxies , and demonstrated that luminosity profiles of starbursts are well represented by the @xmath17 profile which is quite similar to those of elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , in order to derive the stellar density distribution in starbursts , it is important to eliminate the effects of dust extinction , since the effect of radiative transfer can easily alter the luminosity profile from the original one . as we will show later",
    ", this effect is not negligible even in the @xmath51-band in ulirgs ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "therefore , the true density distribution of stars in starburst galaxies is difficult to determine directly , and we therefore adopt the typical density profile of elliptical galaxies as a first guess .",
    "this topic is further discussed in section 3.3 and 4.4 .    following takagi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we assume that dust is distributed homogeneously within a radius @xmath40 of the starburst region . it is plausible that the dust distributes more diffusely than the stars , due to feedback from supernovae . when the light from centrally concentrated stars dominates the sed , i.e. , optically thin case , this geometry results in a similar sed to the case of shell geometry , which is suggested for uvsbgs by gordon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , meurer , heckman & calzetti ( 1999 ) , witt & gordon ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , in the optically thick case , like ulirgs , the shell geometry results in the spectral cut - off around nir ( see the results by rowan - robinson & efstathiou 1993 ) , and therefore uv - nir sed of ulirgs can not be reproduced with this geometry without invoking the other components , like underlying stellar populations and/or agns .",
    "as we show in section 4.2 , our model can essentially reproduce uv - nir seds of ulirgs only with starburst stellar populations .",
    "these sed fitting results are confirmed with emission line measurements and the observed effective radii in section 4.3 and 4.4 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we believe that the adopted geometry is suitable to approximate the real geometry of starburst regions with various optical depths .      the dust model is adopted from takagi ( 2001 ) who successfully reproduced the extinction curves observed in mw , lmc and smc , as well as the spectrum of galactic cirrus .",
    "the difference among the mw , lmc and smc extinction curves is attributed to the variation of the ratio of carbonaceous dust ( graphite and pahs ) to silicate grains .    the extinction curve is given by the cross - section per hydrogen : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number density of hydrogen , @xmath54 is the extinction - cross section of dust particle with the dust constituent @xmath55 and size @xmath56 .",
    "the size distribution of each dust constituent @xmath57 is taken from takagi ( 2001 ) .",
    "for a constant dust - to - metal ratio , the extinction curve at starburst age @xmath58 is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the gas metallicity with respect to hydrogen mass ( as opposed to the total gas mass ) and @xmath61 is the metallicity of the ism under the same definition .",
    "we adopt @xmath62 , 0.011 , 0.0034 for the mw , lmc and smc extinction curves , respectively ( pagel 1997 ; lequeux et al .",
    "the time variation of optical depth @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath65 is defined by the time dependent total stellar mass @xmath21 . according to the adopted mass - radius relation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the total mass of hydrogen and the mass fraction of hydrogen , respectively",
    "; therefore , @xmath10 does not depend on the value of @xmath33 .",
    "we calculate unobscured stellar seds by using the population synthesis code of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) , in which the effect of stellar metallicity is fully taken into account .",
    "we solve the equation of radiative transfer by using a computational code developed by takagi ( 2001 ) .",
    "isotropic multiple scattering is assumed and the self - absorption of re - emitted energy from dust is fully taken into account .",
    "the temperature fluctuation of very small dust particles is calculated consistently with the radiative transfer .",
    "we assume no gradient of the stellar population along the radius of starburst region .",
    "although gas emission is not considered in our model , a modification of the total sed due to gas emission is not significant unless a starburst is considerably younger than 10 myr ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) .",
    "the contribution from gas emission to the continuum light is especially important in the nir .",
    "as we will show later , no systematic discrepancies in the nir flux are found between model results and observations .",
    "therefore , we believe that starburst galaxies are old enough to have negligible contribution from gas emission to the continuum .",

    "thus , the variation of @xmath10 in starbursts is mainly caused by the geometrical effect ; i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "this result is reasonable , since the luminosity evolution suggests that starbursts are less luminous in the early phase of starbursts . in later phases ,",

    "[ lumrad ] , we show the correction factor for the intrinsic effective radius in the case of @xmath158=1.0 and 1.5 by arrows at the bottom left corner .",
    "nevertheless , the derived limit on the surface brightness is robust for active starburst galaxies , since we confirmed in section 4.4 that for ulirgs and relatively luminous uvsbgs the adopted value @xmath158=2.2 is reasonably consistent with observed effective radii .",
    "note that even if less active starbursts have the smaller value of concentration parameter , the bimodal feature of starburst activity shown in fig .",
    "[ lumrad ] still remains .    in summary",
    ", the sed diagnostics find that 1 ) uvsbgs have an intrinsic effective surface brightness @xmath0 l@xmath1kpc@xmath2 , and 2 ) there is a limit on the size of the starburst region of around @xmath182 kpc .",
    "considering these results , we will propose a picture of bimodal starburst activity which consists of mild starburst activity in uvsbgs with a regulated surface intensity around @xmath0 l@xmath1kpc@xmath2 and an intensive mode of starbursts in ulirgs confined in the region of @xmath183 kpc . in the next subsection",
    ", we will discuss the physical origin of this bimodality .",
    "the regulating mechanisms for the mild starburst intensity have already been proposed by meurer et al . (",
    "following kennicutt ( 1989 ) , they showed that the gas surface density is somewhat close to a critical value at which gas discs would be unstable to self - gravity . according to toomre ( 1964 ) and quirk ( 1972 ) ,",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) proposed the critical surface density for inducing star formation with the instability is @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the velocity dispersion of the gas and @xmath186 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "the parameter @xmath187 is a constant empirically determined as @xmath188 . with angular frequency @xmath189 ,",
    "the epicyclic frequency is given by @xmath190    while kennicutt ( 1989 ) considered the instability around the flat part of the rotation curve in disc galaxies , meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) applied it for the nuclear starbursts near the peak of the rotation curve in inner discs .",
    "we also apply the technique of meurer et al .  to interpret the bimodal trends of sfrs in fig .",
    "[ lumrad ] .",
    "if we consider that the inner disc to be a rigid rotator with a angular frequency @xmath191 , the dynamical time of the disc is given by @xmath192 with a constant @xmath193 for the inner disc , the critical surface density is @xmath194 . with the estimations for the dynamical time and the surface density",
    ", the maximum star formation intensity can be expected as @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath191 are in units of km s@xmath119 and km s@xmath119 kpc@xmath119 , respectively .",
    "with @xmath87 from eq .",
    "( [ eq_bolsfr ] ) , the bolometric surface brightness limit can be introduced as @xmath197 where we take @xmath198 as a typical observable starburst age .    since most of disc galaxies have a central hi velocity dispersion @xmath199 km s@xmath119 ( e.g. dickey , hanson & helou 1990 ) and angular frequency @xmath200 km s@xmath119 kpc@xmath119 ( e.g. armus et al .",
    "1990 ) , this limiting bolometric surface brightness ( @xmath201 ) corresponds well to the limiting intensity of uvsbgs as seen in fig .",
    "[ lumrad ] .",
    "thus , starbursts in uvsbgs can be triggered by the self - gravitational instability in inner gas discs as already pointed out by meurer et al .",
    "this instability seems to induce only mild starburst activity , since the unstable region should have a scale of the disc thickness , and the whole gas in the disc can not concentrate into the unstable region due to the centrifugal force from the disc s rotation .",
    "this means that the maximum size of starburst regions is expected to be similar to the disc thickness @xmath175 kpc , and therefore consistent with the sed fitting results in which no starbursts with @xmath202 kpc are found .",
    "the surface brightness of ulirgs are an order of magnitude larger than that expected from the disc instability .",
    "therefore , ulirgs should be triggered by another mechanism which can induce a stronger concentration of gas . as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ surfaceb ] ) , the surface brightness of starburst regions in uvsbgs are related to the physical properties of parent galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong mass concentration in the central region of ulirgs should result in the strong self - gravity of starburst region , and therefore the starburst region in ulirgs can be dynamically isolated from parent galaxies . in such a case , the surface brightness of ulirgs should be controlled by the relative strength of the self - gravity and its feedback .",

    "furthermore , the analysis of self - gravity and feedback allow us to specify that starburst regions in ulirgs are too massive to be sustained by the feedback effect .",
    "such a system in ulirgs should be dynamically unstable , which can be confirmed by the observed kinematical signature . with the mass and effective radius derived from the sed fitting , we can estimate the velocity dispersion as @xmath222 , which is independent of the direct kinematical estimation from line observations .",

    "the velocity dispersions by 2.3@xmath19 m co absorption are most suitable to probe the gravitational potential in the starburst region , since the effect of bulk motion on the co absorption feature is less important than that on gas emission lines .",
    "comparing to the hi 21 cm lines , the emission line of co molecules seems to be more suitable for our purpose , since these molecules are more concentrated in the starburst region in general .",
    "however , we also rely on the measurements of hi 21 cm line , since the observation of this line can be found in the majority of our sample galaxies , and hi line widths correlate well with the other kinematical tracers such as h@xmath6 and o[ii ] which are strong in the starburst region ( kobulnicky & gebhardt 2000 ) . note that cool gas is kinematically decoupled with the outflowing gas which is indicated by triangles in fig .",

    "[ velocity ] that the sequence of the velocity dispersion seems to be bimodal , again .",
    "the deviation of the observed velocity dispersion is most remarkable for ulirgs .",
    "this means that , for ulirgs , the whole starburst region is dynamically unstable since the observed velocity dispersion is not enough to support it against the gravity due to large masses derived from the sed diagnostics .",
    "such a dynamically unstable state for ulirgs can not be caused by the local disc instability as in uvsbgs , since it requires large mass concentration into the whole starburst region .",
    "therefore , the dynamical disturbance of a galactic scale is necessary to activate ulirgs .",
    "the merging of galaxies can be the most plausible trigger mechanism of ulirgs .",
    "we develop an evolutionary sed model of starburst regions in which the stellar and chemical evolution , including dust , are taken into account consistently .",

    "the apparent effective radii derived from the sed fitting are found to be consistent with observations .",
    "thus , our model can derive both the sfr and intrinsic effective radius from the seds .",
    "the variety of the starburst seds is caused mainly by the compactness of starburst regions , not from the starburst age . from the sed diagnostics , we find bimodal correlations between the sfr and the compactness / optical depth ; more active starburst regions tend to be more compact and heavily obscured .",

    "a simple analysis of the feedback allows us to derive a critical luminosity over which starburst regions can not be sustained by the feedback against self - gravity .",
