    "in the first part @xcite of our study electric double layers have been discussed in detail on mesoscopic scales within the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory , which was pioneered by gouy @xcite and chapman @xcite . the focus of our analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite has been on electrodes of spherical or cylindrical shape surrounded by an electrolyte solution .",
    "such kind of setups serve as models for certain parts of so - called double layer capacitors , i.e. , electrical energy storage devices which are promising candidates for supporting sustainable energy systems . in part",
    "i @xcite the differential capacitance @xmath0 , which is the change of the surface charge density upon varying the electrostatic potential at the wall and thus is experimentally accessible , has been analyzed in particular concerning its dependence on the surface charge density and on the radius of the curved electrode .",
    "the focus has been , within the pb model , on a thorough discussion of the dependence of the capacitance on the geometry of the system .    especially for large and small curvatures of the electrodes",
    "the behavior has been discussed systematically . on one hand ,",
    "the simplifying assumptions underlying the pb approach facilitate such a detailed discussion , and , on the other hand , they are also the reason for the approach to be only reliable for weak ionic strengths ( below @xmath1 ) and low electrode potentials ( below @xmath2 ) in the case of monovalent salts in aqueous solutions @xcite .",
    "but already in these ranges deviations from experimental data are observable : the predicted differential capacitance is larger than the measured one @xcite .",
    "therefore stern introduced a model which accounts for that shortcoming by combining the gouy - chapman description of the diffuse layer , i.e. , the charge in the fluid is distributed continuously following the pb equation , with the model of a helmholtz layer of counterions , i.e. , the charge in the fluid is directly attached to the electrode surface within a molecular layer @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the pure gouy - chapman description , which does not consider the granular character of the fluid , has been improved by introducing a stern layer in between the electrode and the diffuse layer , i.e. , the actual nonzero particle volumes are taken into account only close to the wall . as a consequence",
    "the total capacitance of the system can be considered as a circuit of two capacitors ( i.e. , the stern layer and the diffuse layer ) in series @xcite and , following the rules for electric circuits , the total capacitance is smaller than the gouy - chapman capacitance . practically , one is left to fit the capacitance of the stern layer to experimental results which , on one hand , might lead to good agreements with measurements but which , on the other hand , provides only a coarse microscopic picture of the electrical double layer .",
    "one possible interpretation of the results of the stern theory is that close to the wall the permittivity is reduced @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated models have been developed in order to describe the structure of an electrical double layer more precisely than within the mesoscopic pb approach according to which the ions are treated as pointlike charges dissolved in a homogeneous background .",
    "three classes of corresponding models are common in the literature . within the so - called `` primitive model '' ( pm )",
    "the ions are considered as charged hard spherical particles which are dissolved in a solvent which is taken into account only via the permittivity . in the so - called `` solvent primitive model '' ( spm )",
    "the solvent particles exhibit also a nonzero volume and are often described as hard spheres . sometimes these models are labelled in conjunction with the attribute `` restricted '' which means that all particle radii are equal . yet more elaborate theories incorporate the electrostatics between ions and solvent particles by providing the latter with a dipole .    in 1980",
    "carnie and chan used the so - called `` civilized model '' in order to model an electrolyte solution @xcite . therein ,",
    "as opposed to a primitive model , both the ions and the solvent are treated on an equal basis .",
    "the ions are represented by hard spheres with charges whereas the solvent is represented by hard spheres with an embedded dipole . in ref .",
    "@xcite exact and approximative results within the mean spherical approximation are presented for the structure of the electrolyte solution at a charged planar surface . for low ionic concentrations",
    "the surface potential has the stern layer form , i.e. , the expression of the surface potential is the sum of the diffuse part of the electrical double layer and an additional part which can be interpreted as the contribution of a stern layer .",
    "thus the result is regarded as a derivation of the stern layer behavior .",
    "analytic expressions reveal that both the nonzero ion size and the dipolar solvent alter the capacitance , which otherwise reduces to the double - layer capacitance of the linearized gouy - chapman theory .",
    "however , this change is not very large @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar approach is used in order to complement the results of ref .",
    "hard core and solvent effects , both of which are taken into account , lead to a reduction of the differential capacitance , i.e. , the trend indicated by the stern model is confirmed .",
    "however , the alignment of the dipoles close to the planar wall persists for several layers into the fluid .",
    "this ordering is not confined to a single stern - like layer next to the electrode .",
    "the so - called reference hypernetted - chain theory is used in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to examine the double layer at the surface of large spherical macroions within a multipolar hard sphere model of electrolyte solutions , i.e. , the ions are charged hard spheres and the solvent molecules are hard spheres carrying point multipoles .",
    "the structure of the double layer is discussed in terms of , e.g. , the potential of mean force between the macroion and a counterion , ion or solvent number density profiles , and mean electrostatic potentials .",
    "the dependences of the structure on the surface charge density , the ionic concentration , and the ( macro-)ionic radii are examined .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a possible realization of a microscopic model for electric double layers within density functional theory ( dft ) is proposed .",
    "the functional is formulated for a mixture of spheres with embedded point charges or dipoles .",
    "consequently , the excess part of the dft functional splits into a coulombic and into hard sphere parts where for the latter the fundamental measure theory ( see refs .",
    "[ 12 , 13 ] in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is adopted . within this approach various density profiles near a charged planar wall",
    "are presented , which , due to the granular nature of the fluid , exhibit pronounced oscillations .",
    "the authors conclude by comparison that the primitive model is able to reproduce well ionic density profiles in low concentration regimes and beyond a certain distance from the wall .",
    "however , within the microscopic description and for higher concentrations the number density oscillations become increasingly pronounced such that a primitive model description turns out to be inadequate .    within the microscopic model used in ref .",
    "@xcite the coulombic interactions are taken into account in a mean - field - like kind while the excluded - volume effects are accounted for by the percus yevick approach .",
    "the radii of the various particle species , i.e. , anions , cations , and solvent molecules , are chosen differently .",
    "this qualitatively affects the dependence of the differential capacitance @xmath0 on the surface charge density @xmath3 of the planar electrode : within the gouy - chapman theory @xmath0 is an even function of @xmath3 , whereas for unequal values of the particle radii this symmetry disappears .",
    "oleksy and hansen have used dft with an explicit solvent description in order to investigate the wetting and drying behavior of ionic solutions in contact with a charged solid substrate @xcite .",
    "all particles are treated as hard spheres and the corresponding excluded - volume correlations are taken into account by fundamental measure theory .",
    "the other interactions , i.e. , the electrostatic interaction and the cohesive yukawa attraction , are treated within mean field theory in order to ensure full thermodynamic self - consistency .",
    "the key finding is the remarkable agreement between this version of a civilized model and a previous model in which the dipoles are not explicitly taken into account .",
    "henderson and coworkers proposed a nonprimitive model which differs from the aforementioned models with respect to the shape of the solvent particles @xcite .",
    "within dft hard spherical ions are considered to be dissolved in a solvent which is composed of neutral dimers , i.e. , touching positively and negatively charged hard spheres .",
    "the model predicts a larger electrode potential than in the case of an implicit model like the restricted primitive model .",
    "however , for technical reasons , results could only be obtained for comparatively low potential values .",
    "recently , electrolyte aqueous solutions near a planar wall have been discussed within a so - called polar - solvation dft @xcite .",
    "therein all particles are considered as hard spheres via the fundamental measure theory and the mean spherical approximation is used in order to calculate the remaining part of the direct correlation functions . the comparison between the results of this polar - solvation dft , within which the solvent particles are assumed to carry an embedded dipole , and the results of the unpolar - solvation dft of refs .",
    "@xcite , within which the solvent particles are taken into account as hard spheres only , yields , e.g. , a discrepancy in the density profiles which increases with increasing electrode potential . due to technical reasons the model in ref .",
    "@xcite could not be used to study ion concentrations above @xmath4 .",
    "for many years a lot of efforts have been spent in order to understand the structure of electric double layers either at planar walls or around macroions .",
    "therefore various realizations of microscopic approaches , which in general include an explicit description of dipolar solvents , have been proposed @xcite . here",
    "we study the case of a double layer at a spherical electrode of _ arbitrary _ radius @xmath5 . in the spirit of part",
    "i @xcite of this study , the structure of the electrolyte solution is captured in terms of the differential capacitance @xmath0 , which facilitates to judge the relevance of various system parameters . as compared to the mesoscopic pb approach used in part i",
    "@xcite , in the present microscopic description the size of the spherical electrode affects the layering behavior of the particles due to steric effects . in addition , the charges or dipoles , embedded in the particles , interact with each other and with the charge on the electrode . due to the interplay of various interactions , structural features , such as the spatially varying dipole orientation of the solvent particles , are expected to exhibit a comparatively complex dependence on the electrode radius .",
    "the model used within the present study is inspired by the work of oleksy and hansen @xcite .",
    "it incorporates the aforementioned features ( non - vanishing and distinct particle volumes as well as spatially varying dipole orientations ) , which contribute to the differential capacitance in ways that are , due to the influence of the electrode size , not yet well understood .",
    "apart from dealing with the hard spheres the interactions are taken into account within a random phase description @xcite , the relatively simple structure of which allows one to conveniently generalize the planar geometry to the spherical one .",
    "moreover , the concept of introducing an additional cohesive attraction amongst the particles corresponds to our intention to discuss an electrolyte solution in the liquid state under realistic conditions . to that end the respective model parameters",
    "are chosen to mimic liquid water as the solvent at room temperature and ambient pressure .",
    "the differential capacitance is discussed as function of the remaining inherent system parameters , in particular , the wall curvature . here ,",
    "especially the dependence on the latter contains mechanisms which are not revealed by more primitive models such that quantitative or even qualitative differences between our model and the more primitive ones can be expected to occur .    in sec .",

    "[ section : discussion ] where the structures of the electric double layers are illustrated via spatially varying number density profiles .",

    "finally , the capacitance data of spherical electrodes are discussed as function of the electrode curvature and of the surface charge density . the influence of various choices of system parameters is discussed and various models are compared with each other .",
    "our microscopic approach follows the one of oleksy and hansen in ref .",
    "@xcite which is sometimes referred to as the so - called _ civilized model _ @xcite according to which both the ions and the solvent are treated on equal footing , in contrast to the primitive model .",
    "we consider an electrolyte solution composed of three species : solvent particles ( hard spheres with radius @xmath6 and an embedded dipole of strength @xmath7 ) , monovalent cations ( hard spheres with radius @xmath8 carrying a charge @xmath9 , @xmath10 denoting the absolute value of the elementary charge ) , and monovalent anions ( hard spheres with radius @xmath11 carrying a charge @xmath12 ) .",
    "the spatial extent of the electrolyte solution is restricted due to the presence of an electrode occupying the volume @xmath13 . in the present study",
