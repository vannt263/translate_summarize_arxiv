    "fractal theory has presented a growing interest in many applied areas in the last decades , for instance , in medicine @xcite , physics @xcite , computer science @xcite , engineering @xcite , among many other fields .",
    "most of these applications employ the fractal dimension to describe objects that be classified or simply described in some manner .",
    "fractal dimension provides important information about the object . while in a fractal",
    ", the dimension measures the `` fractality '' , in a real - world object , it expresses the spatial occupation of the structure .",
    "more practically , this implies that fractal dimension is capable of capturing important physical and visual attributes , like , or the repetition of geometrical patterns .    despite its importance as a powerful descriptor ,",
    "fractal dimension is still limited in the representation of more complex structures .",
    "this is true mainly in the analysis of real world objects , when the level of `` fractality '' varies along the same object .",
    "the literature shows some approaches to solve this problem , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work is focused on the fractal descriptors solution .    here",
    ", we propose a novel fractal descriptor based on the triangular prism fractal dimension @xcite and apply it to the discrimination and retrieval of texture images . in this approach",
    ", the fractal dimension is estimated different scales of observation and a weight parameter is introduced as an exponent in the sum of the areas , changing the influence of each scale in the final result and ensuring a more complete and flexible description of the image .",
    "the proposed technique is tested over two well - known .",
    "the results of the classification and retrieval of such data sets are compared to other classical and recent texture analysis methods .",
    "the results confirm that the proposed descriptor is a valuable tool for image analysis tasks .",
    "texture analysis is a paradigm where the image is described in terms of statistical patterns formed by spatial arrangements of pixel intensities .",
    "the first known systematic study on this topic was carried out by haralick @xcite and his co - occurrence matrices . since then , a large number of methods on texture analysis have been proposed in the literature . among the most successful approaches one can mention local binary patterns @xcite , bag - of - features @xcite , scale - invariant feature transform @xcite , spatial pyramid matching @xcite , invariants of scattering transforms @xcite , fast features invariant to rotation and scale of texture @xcite , and others .    during the last decades , another branch of methods that have presented interesting results in texture analysis , especially on natural images , are those based on fractal geometry , particularly multifractals @xcite , multiscale fractal dimension @xcite and fractal descriptors @xcite . in this context",
    ", this work proposes the study and application of fractal descriptors based on the estimative of the fractal dimension using a tessellation of triangular prisms @xcite .",
    "our proposal has some particular characteristics that distinguish it from other approaches in the literature .",
    "first , rather than pre - selecting preferable regions in the image as in @xcite , here all pixels and scales are equally important _ a priori _ , which simplifies the modelling and interpretation of the texture descriptors . another difference from methods such as those in @xcite is that image invariances are not treated explicitly , although the underlying model and multi - scale process ensures that such effect is attenuated in practice .",
    "this is confirmed here in the experimental analysis and avoids the use of cumbersome strategies when in many cases invariances are not a critical issue or even when , for example , a rotated texture should be interpreted as a different object .",
    "finally , an important distinction should be done from approaches such as those in @xcite where direct relations are established based on te pixel values .",
    "here there is a complete and well - defined physical model behind the statistics extracted from the image , causing it to be more precise in most cases and more robust to deformations usually found in natural structures .",
    "fractal geometry many diverse areas @xcite .",
    "this is motivated mainly by the flexibility of fractal theory in objects , which can not be represented through conventional euclidean geometry .",
    "fractal theory also presents a concise and powerful framework to describe and identify a natural object , based primarily on the fractal dimension concept . roughly speaking",
    ", fractal dimension measures the complexity of a structure . in this case",
    ", complexity is related to the property of presenting details at different of observation . in this way ,",
    "fractal dimension is of particular importance because it is strongly related to fundamental physical and visual features of the object , , , , others .",
    "the following section describes in a few words some important aspects of fractal geometry theory and its application to texture analysis .",
    "fractal dimension is formally defined as being the hausdorff - besicovitch dimension of a geometrical set of points @xmath2 that composes the fractal .    in order to define the hausdorff - besicovitch dimension , @xmath3",
    "should be defined : @xmath4 where    the behavior of @xmath5 against @xmath6 , observes that @xmath7 jumps from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at a particular real non - negative value of @xmath6 .",
    "this value is the or fractal dimension .",
    "although the above definition is consistent and be applied to any set of points immersed in the euclidean space , it to be difficult or even impracticable in many situations where the fractal dimension of an object has to be estimated . with the aim of simplifying the computation in such situations , an approximate discrete version of the dimension , known as similarity dimension @xmath10 , can be defined by : where @xmath11 is the number of with length @xmath12 used to cover the fractal object . actually , @xmath11 is a metric that can be generalized to a large sort of measures , both in spatial and frequency domain .",
    "this gives rise to a lot of methods for estimation of fractal dimension @xcite , like bouligand - minkowski , box - counting , fourier , etc .",
    "the triangular prism dimension employed in this work is an example of method derived from the similarity dimension .",
    "this method for the estimation of fractal dimension , proposed in @xcite , is based on the relation between the surface area of a triangular tessellation of the gray - level map and the dimension of the base of each triangle .",
    "the image is divided into a grid of squares with side - length @xmath12 . for each square",
    ", a triangular prism is constructed using the pixel intensities in each corner as the heights and a central point whose height is given by the average of the corner heights .",
    "thus in a gray - level image @xmath13 , be the pixel intensities delimiting the grid square , such that : the center of the prism has height @xmath14 given by the simple average : @xmath15    figure [ fig : tri ] depicts a scheme of the prism construction .",
    "the set of prisms composes a tessellation surface , such that the total area of this surface can be computed by using some geometrical procedures .",
    "thus for each prism , the of each face @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by : : @xmath20 the total area of each triangular prism is provided by : @xmath21 where the total area of the surface is computed by summing the area of each prism in the grid with step @xmath12 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the set of points in the grid with step @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for a range of values of @xmath12 and in each step the area @xmath24 is estimated .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath19 is extracted from the log - log relation between @xmath12 and @xmath25 , such that , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the slope of a straight line fit to the curve @xmath28 .",
    "fractal descriptors are an extension of fractal dimension concept . actually , although fractal dimension is it is still insufficient to represent .",
    "we fractals the same fractal dimension despite their completely different .",
    "such situation is when we deal with objects from the real world , which are not real fractals . in these structures ,",
    "we find different levels of `` fractality '' according to the or even to the spatial region analyzed . in this context",
    "we need a tool capable of the object in all its extension .",
    "fractal descriptors @xcite a solution to fill this gap , possible a richer analysis of .",
    "figure [ fig : desc ] illustrates two distinct texture images whose fractal dimensions ( fd ) are similar .",
    "the fd estimation is not enough distinguish the images .",
    "for the same images , figure [ fig : desc ] shows the normalized fractal descriptor curves , which demonstrates capable of discriminating the textures in a straightforward manner .",
    "essentially , the purpose of fractal descriptors is to estimate the fractal dimension under different scales , providing information of different patterns and arrangements present in the structure . a natural candidate to allow",
    "this analysis is the power - law intrinsic to the fractal dimension @xmath19 . from the we can write : where @xmath29 is any measure , related to the spatial or frequency distribution of the object and @xmath12 is the scale parameter .",
    "the power - law relation may be stated in a quite simple fashion : @xmath30    fractal descriptors consist in extracting features from the following function : @xmath31    the function @xmath32 may be used in different manners directly , as in @xcite , or after a multiscale transform @xcite or by the application of principal component analysis or still functional data analysis in @xcite , among many other possibilities .",
    "this work proposes a novel fractal descriptor based on the fractal dimension estimated by triangular prisms . in this case",
    ", the fractality function @xmath33 corresponds to the area function @xmath24 .",
    "following the general idea of fractal descriptors , the proposed features are provided by .",
    ", to improve the ability of identifying multiscale patterns along the texture , the proposed method introduces an exponent weight @xmath27 to the area sum @xmath24 , which now has the following expression : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is defined as in equation [ eq : area ] .    for image analysis purposes , a range of values @xmath27 is chosen empirically and the following values are taken into account to compose the descriptors @xmath19 : @xmath36    finally , since the above expression generates a too much large set of features , a reduction of dimensionality is necessary .",
    "such procedure is carried out by a karhunen - love ( kl ) transform .",
    "thus let @xmath37 be the feature matrix , that is , a matrix each line corresponds to the vector @xmath19 of a sample and each column is a descriptor .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath38 is defined by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of descriptors in @xmath19 , @xmath41 is the @xmath42 column of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the average of the vector . in the following a second matrix @xmath45",
    "is defined as having in each column the eigenvectors of @xmath38 , sorted according to decreasing values of eigenvalues .",
    "finally , the kl transform @xmath46 of @xmath37 is obtained by @xmath47 now , @xmath46 is the new matrix of features .",
    "it has the same dimensions of @xmath37 and each line in @xmath46 contains the final descriptors of the respective sample .",
    "based on the kl transform theory , the first descriptors are the most meaningful for the analysis . here , the descriptors are considered in this order and , as it will be described in results section , the number of such descriptors is varied between 1 and a predefined maximum , to find out the best configuration empirically .",
    "figure [ fig : method ] summarizes the described steps in a visual diagram .",
    "the proposed method combines two types of information to provide a rich and reliable image descriptor .",
    "the first is the complexity , measured by the fractal dimension .",
    "such property is strongly correlated with physical characteristics of the object .",
    "the second one is the multiscale analysis that is accomplished by the parameter @xmath12 . using the curve of ensures that the complexity information is expressed along a range of scales .",
    "finally , the exponent @xmath27 provides an empirical weight for each scale , making the proposed descriptors more flexible to address the description of so diverse objects .",
    "all this combination yields a method capable of identifying and discriminating objects even in severe situations as when there is high variability among elements of a same class and/or high similarity among samples of different classes .",
    "figure [ fig : descriptor ] visually illustrates the discrimination of two classes of textures by the proposed method .            to better understand how and why tringular prisms work on the image",
    ", we should look at its mathematical interpretation .",
    "the classical analysis of the relation between triangular prisms and fractal theory is that adopted in @xcite .",
    "it relies on the idea of extending the `` walking - dividers '' approach @xcite to a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "here we propose a second interpretation based on the theory of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite .",
    "our first objective is to establish the relation between the prism areas and the pixel gray levels in the image .",
    "we illustrate the computation in face @xmath16 .",
    "as @xmath14 can be written as a function of @xmath48 we can rewrite @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 we can also plug the definition of @xmath52 into the area @xmath16 : @xmath53 replacing @xmath54 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 with their respective representation in terms of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 we end up with the following expression : @xmath59 ^ 2 }          } { 4}\\\\            = \\frac{\\epsilon}{4 } \\sqrt{1.25a^2 + 1.25b^2 + 0.25c^2 + 0.25d^2 - 1.5ab - 0.5ac - 0.5ad - 0.5bc - 0.5bd + 0.5cd + \\epsilon^2}\\\\          = \\frac{\\epsilon}{8 } \\sqrt{5a^2 + 5b^2 + c^2 + d^2 - 6ab - 2ac - 2ad - 2bc - 2bd + 2cd + 4\\epsilon^2}\\\\           \\end{array}\\ ] ] rearranging terms we can write the above expression as @xmath60 the expression enclosed by the square root contains three squared terms and the leading one is @xmath61 .",
    "the points in the image where the intensities are @xmath55 and @xmath56 are separated by a distance @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the distribution of this term is classically related to the fbm process @xcite .",
    "an fbm process @xmath62 is a gaussian non - stationary stochastic process , with mean zero and variance @xmath63 , whose covariance statistics satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the expected value and @xmath66 is a parameter named hurst exponent .",
    "another way of defining the same process is to write @xmath67    seminal works on fractal geometry in images , such as those of mandelbrot @xcite and pentland @xcite , already demonstrated that fractal characteristics in images reflect fractality in the physical process originating the pictured object .",
    "pentland even carried out a survey to discover that such relation can be perceptually confirmed by human beings .",
    "since then , a number of studies have been based on this assumption and fbm has been considered the canonical representation for such physical processes giving rise to fractal images .    in this context , the expression ( [ eq : var ] ) has been paramount .",
    "if the image obeys the statistics in ( [ eq : var ] ) with an acceptable @xmath50-value the image can be analyzed as a statistical fractal .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated in @xcite , the fbm has fractal dimension ( in the sense of hausdorff - besicovitch ) equals to @xmath68 with probability @xmath69 .    in practice",
    "it is usual to verify the statistics ( [ eq : var ] ) in an image @xmath13 by checking the curve of @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 stands for the average and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are points separated by @xmath12 .",
    "this is in essence what is expressed by the term @xmath61 in ( [ eq : trifbm ] ) .",
    "the second squared term ( @xmath76 ) can be seen as a correction taking into account the influence of the neighbor pixels in the fbm covariance .",
    "similarly , the parameter @xmath12 appears as a weight expressing the scale size .",
    "we can conclude from this that the triangular prisms are capable of representing two classical viewpoints in fractal geometry , to know , a geometrical interpretation such as `` walking - dividers '' and a statistical approach derived from fbm . back to the context of fractal descriptors , the statistics ( [ eq : var ] )",
    "does not to fit perfectly the image .",
    "rather what we expect to find is how the image is more or less close to a fractal in each scale . and",
    "this analysis highly depends on the richness of the measure provided by the method employed to estimate the fractal dimension . in this way ,",
    "a method with a more complete description of the fractal process , both in a geometrical and a statistical sense , tends to be more appropriate than other classical methods in the literature , hence explaining the success achieved by the proposed approach .",
    "now we turn our attention to the exponent @xmath27 in ( [ eq : desc ] ) .",
    "although a generalized version of the multinomial theorem with real exponents exists , it is not straightforward to be interpreted . therefore we opted for employing maclaurin series up to the second order .",
    "the general expression for a real multi - variable function is : @xmath77 we will replace the first term in the summation ( [ eq : desc ] ) by @xmath78 and all the others by @xmath79 resulting in the function @xmath80 .",
    "plugging the power function derivatives : @xmath81 whereas the first summation term is related to the mean of @xmath82 the following ones relate to the correlation between groups of @xmath83 variables .",
    "the exponent @xmath27 gives weight to these terms and the higher the exponent the larger the influence of the correlation within larger groups of variables .",
    "correlation is a well - established statistics in texture images as it is related to haralick second - order statistics @xcite and @xmath27 quantify such property in terms of the prism areas and indirectly on the local fractality of the image .",
    "altogether the combination of an accurate fractal analysis with an intrinsic correlation is what allows for the analysis proposed here to be powerful even in the most challenging scenarios such as when we have high variability among images of a same group or when images from different groups can be confused by more traditional approaches in the literature , where the modelling may be not sufficiently solid and flexible at the same time neither metrics employed can express the parameters of the underlying model with the necessary accuracy .",
    "the following pseudo - code contains the algorithm for the triangular prism descriptors .",
    "essentially it is not too much than a mere translation of the mathematical expressions in section [ sec : tri ] . a simplified version written in matlab@xmath84/octave",
    "can also be found at ;    @xmath85",
    "the proposed method is tested over two data sets , that is , brodatz @xcite and vistex @xcite .",
    "brodatz is a gray - level texture database composed by 111 texture images divided each one into 16 windows with 128@xmath86128 pixels without overlapping .",
    "vistex is composed by 54 color texture images , each one divided into 16 128@xmath86128 windows .",
    "the color images are converted into gray - level ones before the descriptor analysis . in both experiments ,",
    "each entire image is a class and each window corresponds to a sample .",
    "the classification is performed by a linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) method @xcite .",
    "the classification of each is achieved by inputting the proposed descriptors and other well - known texture descriptors to the classifier , using a 10-fold scheme , where one tenth part of the database is used for testing and the remaining samples for training .",
    "the classification results are compared with other state - of - the - art and classical texture descriptors in the literature , that is , local binary patterns ( lbp ) @xcite , gabor - wavelets @xcite , multifractal spectrum @xcite , gray level co - occurrence matrix ( glcm ) @xcite and fourier descriptors @xcite .",
    "the proposed method depends on an exponential parameter that can be to find the most suitable descriptors for each type of image . in this way , to find the best parameters is a fundamental task to ensure a robust solution . in real situations , these variables can be empirically evaluated over the training set .",
    "figure [ fig : exponent](a ) shows the precision in the classification of brodatz data set when using exponents ranging between -1 and 2 . outside this range",
    "there is no significant gain .",
    "based on this plot , the triangular descriptors with exponents between 1 and 1.8 were concatenated and summarized through pca to provide the texture descriptors used the following experiments .",
    "descriptors are used for each exponent .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the proposed method differs from other approaches to texture analysis in the literature in that the physical process underlying the generation of the image is taken into account to a high extent , as we demonstrated its relation with fractional brownian processes .",
    "these processes are known to be widely present in nature and its association with the way that our brain perceives materials ans scenarios around us is well established .",
    "parallel to this , the triangular prisms also encompass a geometrical analysis similar to `` walking - dividers '' , intimately related to the primitive idea of fractals and also commonly observed in natural structures . in itself , such complementary and dual viewpoint of fractality is an important contribution and novelty with regards to other fractal approaches such as multifractals @xcite , bouligand - minkowski @xcite , and others .",
    "the consideration of the physical process also showed to be more advantageous than simply quantifying relations between neighbor pixels without accounting for the semantic involved in the represented object , as in lbp and glcm descriptors .",
    "even though the interpretation of these approaches can be considered more straightforward , the lack of a more realistic model makes them insufficient in more complex cases with larger and more heterogeneous databases as those presented here .",
    "finally , we also compare to other methods where the image is observed beyond the simple pixel values , such as in fourier and gabor descriptors .",
    "these descriptors , however , are ultimately based on linear filtering and are not the ideal solution to explain the non - linearities present in many natural images , mostly caused by the chaotic behavior associated to fbm processes .",
    "generally speaking , the great performance of triangular fractal descriptors in the presented results confirm what is expected from the fractal analysis of natural texture images . indeed",
    ", fractal geometry constitutes a reliable tool to model those structures , which can not be well - described in an euclidean framework .",
    "this analysis is especially complete here as two fractal viewpoints ( statistical and geometrical ) are merged to provide an even more accurate description of the image .",
    "furthermore , fractal descriptors approach enhances the conventional fractal geometry analysis by extracting relevant information of complexity under different scales , by the multiscale analysis implicit when the dimension is estimated for different values of @xmath12 . in this way , these descriptors are capable of providing features representing precise and rich measures of the spatial structure of complex textures like those in benchmark data , as used here , as well as in practical application involving the identification and discrimination of intricate patterns in objects and scenarios represented in a digital image .",
    "this work proposed a novel gray - level texture descriptor based on a particular method of fractal dimension estimation , named triangular prism method .",
    "the descriptors were obtained by combining values of area of a triangular tessellation of the texture , using different steps for the tessellation grid as well as different values for an exponential parameter used as a weight for the area within each cell in the grid .",
    "these descriptors were compared to classical and state - of - the - art texture descriptors in a task of classification of two well - known benchmark texture datasets , e.g. , brodatz and vistex .",
    "the classification results illustrated that the novel approach is a valuable descriptor , achieving remarkable results in image classification and retrieval tasks and suggesting its application to a wide range of problems comprising tasks of pattern recognition in digital images .",
