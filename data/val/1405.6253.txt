    "such a link provides potential opportunities in the quest for understanding these two great mysteries in fundamental physics .",
    "in particular , dm detection experiments  in addition to providing information about dm and its parameters  may in principle be used to shed light on neutrinos and their properties .    in this paper",

    "the ratio of the neutrino to gamma - ray fluxes from dm annihilation in the galactic center is one way to establish a neutrino - philic final state .",
    "moreover , the shape of the spectrum of the neutrino signal from dm annihilation in the galactic center and the sun may contain a novel prompt - neutrino final state , which can only be present if neutrinos are majorana . to achieve the second goal , we use the effective number of neutrinos @xmath5 as a complementary probe .",

    "the prompt neutrino spectra from the aforementioned @xmath166 annihilation channels , as well as the @xmath167 final states from a mssm - like dm case , are injected at the center of the sun and propagated to the solar surface , then to the earth via vacuum oscillation .",

    "when associated with other indirect searches , the shape difference among the channels can help distinguish the annihilation channels , which we withhold for later discussion in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "for the calculation of icecube rates , since the sun is below the horizon during the half - year polar night , the entire icecube can be used ; we only consider the dominant contained events in the direction of sun , and assume a 100% detection efficiency with a 1km@xmath169 effective volume . with",

    "the information provided by @xmath5 is complementary to that from indirect detection because it is completely independent from the identity of dm in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the important point is that in this model the rh neutrinos @xmath10 interact with the sm particles via the exchange of @xmath7 in this model . as we will see",
    ", this implies that if @xmath10 is a dirac partner of a lh neutrino @xmath48 , it will stay in thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma down to low temperatures .",
    "the presence of one or more dirac neutrinos can therefore affect @xmath5 , which is constrained by cmb experiments  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider interactions between @xmath10 and the sm particles in more detail .",

    "if neutrinos are dirac and rh neutrinos remain coupled to the primordial plasma until late times , then their contributions to @xmath205 must be observed .    in conclusion , in this paper we investigated the annihilation of dm into photons and neutrinos in the context of a well - motivated model that explains small neutrino mass .",

    "the neutrinos in the final state arise from @xmath39-wave dominated annihilation of dm .",
    "we also showed that it may be possible to ascertain whether the light neutrinos have a dirac or majorana nature .",
    "when the light neutrinos are majorana type , then the spectrum may show a prompt neutrino box - feature and in addition , the spectrum may exhibit a lower energy kinematic cut - off . the gamma ray signal from the galactic center",
    "may show an early cut - off in such a scenario .",
    "when the light neutrinos are dirac type , we may find their contributions in the measurement of @xmath1 from the cosmic microwave background data .",
    "the signal at icecube depends on the direct detection cross - section ( capture rate ) and the annihilation cross - section for dm equilibration in the sun .",
    "any near - future observation of the neutrinos from the @xmath0 model at icecube will promise a discovery of this model at the direct detection experiments very soon .",
    "the larger annihilation cross - section , as required for equilibration , will make the future detection of the signal from the galactic center hopeful .",
