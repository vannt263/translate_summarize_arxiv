    "the charge exchange of neutrons or protons on the deuteron has a very long history . the first theoretical papers that dealt with the subject",
    "seem to date from the beginning of 1950s with papers by chew  @xcite , gluckstein and bethe  @xcite , and pomeranchuk  @xcite .",
    "the first two groups were strongly influenced by the measurements of the differential cross section of the @xmath6 reaction that were then being undertaken at ucrl by powell  @xcite . apart from coulomb effects , by charge symmetry the cross section for this reaction should be the same as that for @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of the emerging neutron in the forward direction here shows a very strong peaking for an energy that is only a little below that of the incident proton beam .",
    "there was therefore much interest in using the reaction as a means of producing a good quality neutron beam up to what was then `` high '' energies , _",
    "i.e. _ , a few hundred mev .",
    "the theory of this proposal was further developed by watson  @xcite , shmushkevich  @xcite , migdal  @xcite , and lapidus  @xcite .",
    "since we have recently reviewed the phenomenology of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 charge exchange  @xcite , the theory will not be treated here in any detail .",
    "the aim of the present paper is rather to discuss the database of the existing inclusive and exclusive measurements and make comparisons with the information that is available from neutron - proton elastic scattering data .",
    "the proton and neutron bound in the deuterons are in a superposition of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states and their spins are parallel .",
    "on the other hand , if the four - momentum transfer @xmath10 between the incident neutron and final proton in the @xmath11 reaction is very small , the pauli principle demands that the two emerging neutrons be in the spin - singlet states @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in impulse ( single - scattering ) approximation",
    ", we would then expect the transition amplitude to be proportional to a spin - flip isospin - flip nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude times a form factor that represents the overlap of the initial spin - triplet deuteron wave function with that of the unbound ( scattering - state ) @xmath3 wave function .",
    "the peaking observed in the energy spectrum of the outgoing proton is due to the huge neutron - neutron scattering length , which leads to a very strong final state interaction ( fsi ) between the two neutrons .",
    "a detailed evaluation of the proton spectrum from the @xmath14 reaction would clearly depend upon the deuteron and @xmath3 wave functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , upon low energy nuclear physics .",
    "however , a major advance was made by dean  @xcite .",
    "he showed that , if one integrated over all the proton energies , there was a closure sum rule where all the dependence on the @xmath3 wave function vanished .",
    "@xmath15\\left(\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}\\right)_{\\!\\!np\\to          pn}^{\\!\\!\\rm sf},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the deuteron form factor . here",
    "the neutron - proton differential cross section is split into two parts that represent the contribution that is independent of any spin transfer ( si ) between the initial neutron and final proton and one where there is a spin flip ( sf ) .    if the beam energy is high , then in the forward direction @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath19 there are modifications to eq .   through the deuteron @xmath20-state though these do not affect the forward limit of eq .  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the ratio @xmath21 is equal to two thirds of the fraction of spin flip in @xmath22 between the incident neutron and proton outgoing in the beam direction .",
    "it is because the ratio of two unpolarised cross sections can give information about the spin dependence of neutron - proton scattering that so many groups have made experimental studies in the field and these are discussed in section  [ qece ] . of course , for this to be a useful interpretation of the cross section ratio the energy has to be sufficiently high for the dean sum rule to converge before any phase space limitations become important .",
    "the longitudinal momentum transfer must be negligible and terms other than the @xmath23 impulse approximation should not contribute significantly to the evaluation of the sum rule .",
    "although the strong @xmath24 fsi helps with these concerns , all the caveats indicate that eq .",
    "would provide at best only a qualitative description of data at the lower energies .",
    "the alternative approach is not to use a sum rule but rather to measure the excitation energy in the outgoing dineutron or diproton with good resolution and then evaluate the impulse approximation directly by using deuteron and @xmath24 scattering wave functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , input information from low energy nuclear physics .",
    "this avoids the questions of the convergence of the sum rule and so might yield useful results down to lower energies .",
    "a second important feature of the @xmath25 reaction in these conditions is that the polarisation transfer between the initial proton and the final neutron is expected to be very large , provided that the excitation energy @xmath26 in the final two - proton system is constrained to be only a few mev  @xcite .",
    "in fact the reaction has been used by several groups to furnish a polarised neutron beam  @xcite but also as a means to study neutron - proton charge exchange observables , as described in section  [ transfer ] .",
    "bugg and wilkin  @xcite realised that in the small @xmath26 limit the deuteron tensor analysing powers in the @xmath2 reaction should also be large and with a significant angular structure that was sensitive to the differences between the neutron - proton spin - flip amplitudes .",
    "this realisation provided an impetus for the study of high resolution @xmath2 experiments that are detailed in section  [ polar ] .",
    "the inclusive @xmath27 or @xmath28 measurements of section  [ qece ] and the high resolution ones of sections  [ transfer ] and [ polar ] are in fact sensitive to exactly the same physics input . to make this explicit",
    ", we outline in section  [ np_elastic ] the necessary @xmath5 formalism through which one can relate the forward values of @xmath29 or @xmath30 , the polarisation transfer in @xmath31 and the deuteron tensor analysing power in @xmath2 in impulse approximation to the longitudinal and transverse polarisation transfer coefficients in neutron - proton elastic scattering .",
    "predictions for the observables are made there using an up - to - date phase shift analysis .",
    "data are available on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters in , respectively , inclusive @xmath14 and @xmath25 reactions at energies that range from tens of mev up to 2  gev and the features of the individual experiments are examined in section  [ qece ] , where the results are compared to the predictions of the phase shift analysis .",
    "polarisation transfer data have become steadily more reliable with time , with firmer control over the @xmath24 excitation energies and better calibrated polarisation measurements so that the data described in section  [ qece ] now extend from 10  mev up to 800  mev .",
    "four experimental programmes were devoted to the study of the cross section and tensor analysing powers of the @xmath2 reaction using very different experimental techniques .",
    "their procedures are described in section  [ polar ] and the results compared with the predictions of the plane wave impulse approximation . in general",
    "this gives a reasonable description of the data out to a three - momentum transfer of @xmath32 by which point multiple scatterings might become important .",
    "these data are however only available in an energy domain where the neutron - proton database is extensive and reliable and the possible extensions are also outlined there .",
    "the comparison between the sum - rule and high resolution approaches is one of the subjects that is addressed in our conclusions of section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the consistency between the information obtained from the @xmath31 and @xmath2 reactions in the forward direction is striking and the belief is expressed that this must contribute positively to our knowledge of the neutron - proton charge exchange phenomenology .",
    "we have shown that the input necessary for the evaluation of the forward charge exchange observables can be expressed as combinations of _ pure _ linearly independent @xmath33 observables evaluated in the backward direction  @xcite .",
    "although the expressions are independent of the scattering amplitude representation , for our purposes it is simplest to use the results of polarisation transfer experiments .",
    "the @xmath24 formalism gives two series of polarisation transfer parameters that are mutually dependent  @xcite .",
    "using the notation @xmath34 for experiments with measured spin orientations for the scattered @xmath35 , recoil @xmath36 , beam @xmath37 , and target @xmath38 particles , we have either the polarisation transfer from the beam to recoil particles,@xmath39 or the polarisation transfer from the target to the scattered particle@xmath40 here @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the corresponding pauli matrices and @xmath45 is the scattering matrix .",
    "the unpolarised invariant elastic scattering cross section @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the momentum in the cm frame and @xmath48 is the four - momentum transfer .",
    "a first series of parameters describes the scattering of a polarised neutron beam on an unpolarised proton target , where the polarisation of the final outgoing protons is measured by an analyser through a second scattering .",
    "the spins of the incident neutrons can be oriented either perpendicularly or longitudinally with respect to the beam direction , with the final proton polarisations being measured in the same directions . at @xmath49",
    "there are two independent parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , referring respectively to the transverse ( @xmath52 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath53 ) directions .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the forward @xmath54 cross section ratio can be written in terms of these as@xmath55    a second series of parameters describes the scattering of an unpolarised neutron beam on a polarised proton target , where it is the polarisation of the final outgoing neutron that is determined .",
    "this leads to the alternative expression for @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 but @xmath59 .",
    "other equivalent relations are to be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    it can not be stressed enough that the small angle @xmath28 charge exchange on the deuteron is sensitive to the spin transfer from the incident neutron to the outgoing proton and not that to the outgoing neutron .",
    "the latter observables are called the depolarisation parameters @xmath20 which , for example , are given in the case of a polarised target by @xmath60 if one were to evaluate instead of eq .   the combination",
    "@xmath61 then one would get a completely independent ( and wrong ) answer . using the said sp07 phase shift solution at 100  mev",
    "one finds that @xmath62 while @xmath63 .",
    "hence one has to be very careful with the statement that the @xmath33 spin dependence in the backward direction is weak or strong .",
    "it depends entirely on which particles one is discussing .    in plane wave impulse approximation",
    ", the one non - vanishing deuteron tensor analysing power in the @xmath64 reaction in the forward direction can be expressed in terms of the same spin - transfer parameters , provided that the excitation energy in the @xmath4 system is very small such that it is in the @xmath12 state  @xcite : @xmath65 in an attempt to minimise confusion , observables in the nucleon - deuteron sector will be labelled with capital letters and only carry two subscripts .",
    "in the same approximation , the longitudinal and transverse spin - transfer parameters in the @xmath66 between the initial proton and the final neutron emerging in the beam direction are similarly given by @xmath67,\\\\ k_{nn}(0 ) & = -\\left[\\frac{1+k_{0ll0}(\\pi)-2k_{0nn0}(\\pi ) } { 3-k_{0ll0}(\\pi)-2k_{0nn0}(\\pi)}\\right ] .",

    "this condition is well met by the data described here , where @xmath26 is always below 1  mev  @xcite .",
    "this prediction , which is also tabulated in table  [ table1 ] , describes the trends of the data very well in regions where the neutron - proton phase shifts are well determined .",
    "we also show in the figure the values of @xmath76 deduced using eq .   from the @xmath66 measurements summarised in table  [ table_transfer ] .",
    "only those data are retained where the neutron polarisation was well measured and the @xmath4 excitation energy was small , though generally not as well determined as when the two final protons were detected .",
    "the consistency between the @xmath77 and @xmath78 data is striking and it is interesting to note that they both suggest values of @xmath76 that are slightly lower in magnitude at high energies than those predicted by the @xmath5 phase shifts of the said group  @xcite .",

    "[ annsum ] ]    although we have concentrated here on the results for the forward analysing power , it is clear that this represents only a small part of the total data set as demonstrated by the results of figs .",
    "[ sams ] , [ serge ] , and [ david ] .",
    "originally the deuteron was thought of merely as a useful substitute for a free neutron target . as an example of this , it has been shown that at large momentum transfers the spin - dependent parameters measured in free @xmath5 scattering and quasi - free in @xmath81 collisions give very similar results  @xcite .",
    "the situation is very different at low momentum transfers where it is not clear which of the nucleons is the spectator or , indeed , whether the concept of calling one of the nucleons a spectator makes any sense at all .",
    "however , a more interesting effect comes about in the medium energy neutron charge exchange on the deuteron , @xmath82 , when the excitation energy @xmath83 in the two neutron system is very low . under such conditions the pauli principle demands that the two neutrons should be in a @xmath12 state and",
    "there then has to be spin - flip isospin - flip transition from the spin - triplet @xmath5 in the deuteron to the singlet @xmath3 system .",
    "the rate for the charge - exchange deuteron breakup @xmath82 would then depend primarily on the spin - spin @xmath22 amplitudes .",
    "the above remarks only assume a practical importance because of an `` accident '' in the low energy nucleon - nucleon interaction . in the @xmath3 system",
    "there is an antibound ( or virtual ) state pole only a fraction of an mev below threshold .",
    "although the pole position is displaced slightly in the @xmath4 case by the coulomb repulsion , it results in huge @xmath4 and @xmath3 scattering lengths . in the @xmath84 reaction",
    ", it leads to the very characteristic peak at the hard end of the momentum spectrum of the produced proton . since we know that these events are the result of the spin - flip interaction , we clearly want to use them to investigate in greater depth this interaction .",
    "there are two distinct ways to try to achieve our aims and we have tried to review them both in this article .",
    "these are the inclusive ( sum - rule ) approach of section  [ qece ] and the high resolution polarisation experiments of sections  [ transfer ] and [ polar ] .    in impulse approximation , at zero momentum transfer ,",
    "the @xmath14 interaction only excites spin - singlet final states and dean  @xcite has shown that the inclusive measurement of the proton momentum spectrum can then be interpreted in terms of the spin - flip @xmath5 amplitudes through the use of a sum rule .",
    "though the shape of the proton momentum spectrum must depend upon the details of the low energy @xmath3 interaction and also on the deuteron @xmath20-state , the integral over all momenta would not , provided that the sum rule has converged before any of the limitations imposed by the three - body phase space have kicked in .",
    "the inclusive approach has many positive advantages , in addition to being independent of the low energy nucleon - nucleon dynamics . in a direct comparison of the production rates of protons in the @xmath14 and @xmath85 reactions using the same apparatus , many of the sources of systematic errors drop out in the evaluation of the cross section ratio @xmath71 .",
    "these are primarily effects associated with the neutron flux and uncertainties in the proton detection system .",
    "there are , however , no similar benefits when working with a proton beam , where one measures instead @xmath25 . here",
    "one can only construct the @xmath56 ratio by dividing by a @xmath85 cross section that has been measured in an independent experiment .",
    "this is probably the reason why there are fewer entries in table  [ table3 ] compared to table  [ table2 ] .",
    "we must therefore stress that , in general , the @xmath86 determinations of @xmath71 are much to be preferred over those of @xmath25 .    on the face of it , the determination of @xmath56 through the measurement of the two fast protons from the @xmath87 reaction in a bubble chamber looks like a very hard way to obtain a result  @xcite .",
    "in addition to having to use independent data to provide the normalisation cross section in the denominator , the reaction is first measured exclusively in order afterwards to construct an inclusive distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "a full kinematic determination allows one to check many of the assumptions made in the analysis and , in particular , those related to the isolation of the charge - exchange impulse approximation contribution from those of other possible feynman diagrams .",
    "a major difficulty in any of the inclusive measurements is ensuring that the phase space is sufficiently large that the sum rule has been saturated without being contaminated by other driving mechanisms .",
    "this means that the low energy determinations of @xmath71 are all likely to underestimate the `` true '' value and there could be some effects from this even through the energy range of the psi experiments  @xcite .",
    "even more worrying is the fact that at low energies the rapid variation of @xmath88 with @xmath26 , as measured in the @xmath66 reaction  @xcite , shows that there are significant deviations from plane wave impulse approximation with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "these deviations are probably too large to be ascribed to effects arising from the variation of the longitudinal momentum transfer with @xmath26 .",
    "this brings into question the whole sum rule approach at low energies .",
    "the alternative high resolution approach of measuring the @xmath12 peak of the final state interaction requires precisely that , _",
    "i.e. _ , high resolution .",
    "this can be achieved in practice by measuring the @xmath28 reaction with a very long time - of - flight path  @xcite or by measuring the protons in the @xmath89 reaction with either a deuteron beam  @xcite or a very low density deuterium target  @xcite .",
    "the resulting data are then sensitive to the low energy @xmath5 interaction in the deuteron and the @xmath4 interaction in the @xmath12 final state",
    ". however , such interactions are well understood and lead to few ambiguities in the charge exchange predictions .",
    "establishing a good overall normalisation can present more of a challenge .",
    "in addition to obvious acceptance and efficiency uncertainties , if one evaluates a cross section integrated up to say @xmath90  mev then one has to measure the 3  mev with good absolute precision , which is non - trivial for a deuteron beam in the gev range .",
    "hence it might be that at high energies the inclusive measurements could yield more precise determinations of absolute values of @xmath71  @xcite than could be achieved by using high resolution experiments .",
    "on the other hand , measuring just the fsi peak with good resolution allows one more easily to follow the variation with momentum transfer and there are also fewer kinematic ambiguities .",
    "more crucially , the spin information from the @xmath91 or @xmath92 reactions enables one to separate the different spin contributions to the small angle charge exchange cross section .",
    "it could of course be argued that this is not just a benefit for an exclusive reaction since , if the dubna bubble chamber experiments  @xcite had been carried out with a polarised deuteron beam , then these would also have been able to separate the contributions from the two independent forward spin - spin contributions through the use of the generalised dean sum rule  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , much more feasible to carry out @xmath93 measurements with modern electronic equipment and the hope is that , through the use of polarised beams and targets , they will lead to evaluations of the relative phases between the three independent @xmath22 spin - spin amplitudes out to at least @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "we have been very selective in this review , concentrating our attention on the forward values of the @xmath0 cross section ratio , the @xmath91 polarisation transfer , and the deuteron tensor analysing power in nucleon - deuteron charge - exchange break - up collisions . in the latter cases , we have specialised to the kinematic situations where two of the final nucleons emerge in the @xmath12 state . under these conditions",
    "there are strong connections between the three types of experiment described and this we have tried to stress . however , there is clearly much additional information in the data at larger angles , which we have here generally neglected .",
    "we have also avoided discussing the extensive data that have been taken on nuclear targets , where the selectivity of the @xmath91 or @xmath92 reactions can be used to identify particular classes of final nuclear states . at the higher energies",
    ", these states could even include the excitation of the @xmath94 isobar .    despite the successful measurements , none of the @xmath71 data nor those from the exclusive polarised measurements have so far been included in any of the existing phase shift analyses .",
    "they have merely been used as _ a posteriori _ checks on their predictions .",
    "we have argued that they could also provide valuable input into the direct neutron - proton amplitude reconstruction in the backward direction  @xcite . for any of these purposes it would be highly desirable to control further the range of validity of the models used to interpret the data and , in particular , to examine further the effects of multiple scattering .",
    "there remain therefore theoretical as well as experimental challenges to be overcome .",
