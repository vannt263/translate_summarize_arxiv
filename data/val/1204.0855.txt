    "* keywords * : model uncertainty ; stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) ; probability measures ; hellinger distance ; stationary probability density ; parameter estimation ; numerical simulation          mathematical models for scientific and engineering systems often involve with some uncertainties .",
    "we may roughly classify such uncertainties into two kinds .",
    "the first kind of uncertainties may be called _ model",
    "uncertainty_. they are due to physical processes that are not well understood or not well - observed , and thus are not or not well represented in the mathematical models .",
    "the second kind of uncertainties may be called _ simulation uncertainty_. this arises in numerical simulations of multiscale systems that display a wide range of spatial and temporal scales , with no clear scale separation . due to the limitations of computer power , not all scales of variability",
    "can be explicitly simulated or resolved .",
    "these uncertainties are sometimes also called _ unresolved scales _ , as they are not represented ( i.e. , not _ resolved _ ) in modeling or simulation .",
    "although these unresolved scales may be very small or very fast , their long time impact on the resolved simulation may be delicate ( i.e. , may be negligible or may have significant effects @xcite , or in other words , uncertain ) .",
    "thus , to take the effects of unresolved scales on the resolved scales into account , representations or parameterizations of these effects are desirable .",
    "model uncertainties have been considered in , for example , @xcite .",
    "research works relevant for parameterizing unresolved scales include , @xcite among others .",
    "stochastically representing unresolved scales in fluid dynamics has considered as well @xcite .    in this chapter , we only consider model uncertainties .",
    "specifically , we consider dynamical systems containing uncertain parameters or unknown system functions , and examine how to estimate these parameters , using observed probability distributions of the system evolution .",
    "after briefly comment on estimating uncertain parameters based on observed sample paths for the system evolution in  [ paths ] , we then , in  [ measures ] , propose a method of estimating uncertain parameters based on observed probability distributions ( i.e. , probability measures ) and present a few examples to demonstrate this method , analytically or numerically .",
    "since random fluctuations are common in the real world , mathematical models for complex systems are often subject to uncertainties , such as fluctuating forces , uncertain parameters , or random boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) such as @xmath0 are appropriate models for many of these systems @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 is a brownian motion or wiener process , the drift @xmath2 and diffusion @xmath3 contain uncertain parameters ( or @xmath4 and @xmath5 are unknown ) , to be estimated based on observations .",
    "for example , the langevin type models are stochastic differential equations describing various phenomena in physics , biology , and other fields .",
    "sdes are used to model various price processes , exchange rates , and interest rates , among others , in finance .",
    "noises in these sdes may be modeled as a generalized time derivative of some distinguished stochastic processes , such as brownian motion ( bm ) or other processes .",
    "theoretical results on parameter estimations for sdes driven by brownian motion are relatively well developed @xcite , and various numerical simulations for these parameter estimations @xcite are also implemented .",
    "see @xcite for a more recent review about estimating and computing uncertain parameters , when dynamical systems are submit to colored or non - gaussian noises",
    ".    these research works on estimating uncertain parameters in dynamical systems are based on observations of sample paths . in the next section ,",
    "we devise a method to estimate uncertain parameters based on observations of probability distributions of the system evolution .",
    "consider a dynamical system with model uncertainty , modeled by a scalar sde @xmath6 where the drift @xmath2 and diffusion @xmath3 contain uncertain parameters , to be estimated based on observations of probability distributions ( i.e. , probability measures ) of the system paths @xmath7 .    to this end , we need to introduce the hellinger distance @xcite between two probability measures .",
    "it is used to quantify the similarity between two probability distributions .",
    "this is a metric in the space of probability measures .    for our purpose here",
    ", we define the hellinger distance @xmath8 between two probability density functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 as follows @xmath11 the hellinger distance @xmath12 satisfies the property : @xmath13 .",
    "we estimate uncertain parameters by minimizing the hellinger distance between the true probability density @xmath14 for the solution process @xmath15 and its observed probability density @xmath16 . in reality , the probability density @xmath14 has to be numerically formulated or discretized .",
    "but in order to demonstrate the method , we consider two examples for which the true probability density @xmath14 can be analytically formulated . in the first example , we minimize the hellinger distance between the true stationary probability density for the solution process @xmath15 and its observed stationary probability density , while in the second example , we do this for time - dependent probability densities .      under appropriate conditions on @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see @xcite , p.170 ) , such as , @xmath19 and @xmath20 as well as some smoothness requirements , there exists a stationary probability density @xmath21 for the sde , as a solution of the steady fokker - planck equation @xmath22 , @xmath23 where the positive normalization constant @xmath24 is chosen so that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 note that @xmath28 here may be an arbitrary point so that the integral @xmath29 exists ( say , take @xmath30 if that is possible ) .",
    "\\(i ) a special case : langevin equation + @xmath31 with parameter @xmath32 . given an  observation \" of the stationary probability density @xmath33 . find a @xmath17 so that the hellinger distance @xmath34 ^ 2 dx$ ] is minimized .",
    "\\(ii ) a more general case : + @xmath35 with function @xmath36 . given an  observation \" of the stationary probability density @xmath37 ( the cauchy distribution ) . find a function @xmath36 so that the hellinger distance @xmath38 ^ 2 dx$ ] is minimized .",
    "insert @xmath40 into the hellinger distance @xmath41 , which is now an algebraic function of parameter @xmath32 .",
    "thus we use deterministic calculus to find a minimizer @xmath17 ( possibly by hand , or matlab if needed ) .",
    "note : @xmath42 .",
    "insert @xmath40 into the hellinger distance @xmath47 , which is now a functional of @xmath48 and thus we use calculus of variations ( on @xmath47 ) to find a minimizer @xmath48 .",
    "we then derive the euler - lagrange equation to be satisfied by @xmath48 , together with appropriate boundary conditions ( needed for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "consider a scalar sde @xmath70 the fokker - planck equation @xcite for the probability density @xmath71 for the solution @xmath72 is @xmath73 with an observation of @xmath74 , we can estimate parameters , or @xmath75 , or @xmath5 , by examining the inverse problem of the fokker - planck equation . for more information about inverse problems of partial differential equations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "* solution : * + the fokker - planck equation for is @xmath81 in this case , we define the hellinger distance : @xmath82}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } ( \\sqrt{q_i(x , t)}-\\sqrt{p(x , t , b)})^2 dx\\ ] ] where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the time period when @xmath85 are observed .",
    "we numerical find @xmath17 by minimizing @xmath86 .        by the definition @xmath90}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } ( \\sqrt{q_1(x , t)}-\\sqrt{p(x , t , b)})^2 dx$ ]",
    ", we have the plot of @xmath91 in figure [ pq1 ] . and",
