    "argon above its melting temperature is a typical simple fluid .",
    "consisting of spherical atoms that interact via short - range repulsion and long - range attraction , and are heavy enough for the quantum effects to be small , fluid argon and heavier noble gases are an excellent choice of a real system to be used for testing various approaches in classical theory of fluids .",
    "an inter - particle interaction in argon is commonly represented by a well known 126 lennard - jones pair potential @xcite , @xmath0.\\ ] ] the two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are usually determined by fitting thermodynamic properties , derived from the potential ( [ eq : lennard - jones ] ) by theoretical or computational methods , to corresponding experimental data .",
    "it is known that lennard - jones potential is only an approximation to real interaction in argon .",
    "several experimental results obtained for argon at large pressures are better explained if a larger steepness , compared to lennard - jones , of argon - argon interaction potential at small inter - atomic separation distances is taken into account @xcite .",
    "accurate argon ",
    "argon interatomic potentials have been calculated by direct _ ab initio _ quantum chemical calculations @xcite or obtained by inversion of experimental data @xcite . moreover ,",
    "many - body dispersion , exchange and induced polarization contributions to inter - atomic interactions are not small and noticeably influence thermodynamic properties of argon @xcite .",
    "the most widely used of these contributions is triple - dipole dispersion interaction , derived by axilrod and teller @xcite and muto @xcite , and account of this contribution in addition to _ ab initio _ pair potential is sufficient to describe thermodynamic properties of argon with good accuracy @xcite .    by virtue of henderson theorem @xcite , which states that , for fluids with only pairwise interactions , and under given conditions of temperature and density , the pair potential which gives rise to a given radial distribution function @xmath3 is unique up to a constant , the thermodynamic properties of the system with many - body interactions can be described by a model system with an appropriate _ effective _ pair potential . generally , the effective potential depends on the thermodynamic state of the system and thermodynamic property to be described @xcite .",
    "van der hoef and madden @xcite have demonstrated that the account of triple - dipole and dipole - dipole - quadrupole dispersion interactions moves the effective potential of argon towards lennard - jones form ( [ eq : lennard - jones ] ) .",
    "moreover , the possibility of consistent description of many thermodynamic properties of argon , using lennard - jones potential in a wide domain of thermodynamic states @xcite , suggests that the state dependence of the effective potential is weak .",
    "there is no analogous reason for kinetic properties of a system with many - body interactions to be equivalent to those of a system with a corresponding effective pair potential .",
    "nevertheless , experimental data on self - diffusion , shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients of argon have been shown to be accurately described by lennard - jones model with the parameters obtained by fitting thermodynamic data @xcite .",
    "bulk viscosity is a noticeable exception .",
    "bulk viscosity of argon has been measured experimentally @xcite , and its behavior can be qualitatively described by the results of a molecular dynamics simulation of a lennard - jones system @xcite . however",
    ", when results of simulations with lennard - jones potential are rescaled in an attempt to describe experimental data liquid argon , bulk viscosity , contrary to other kinetic properties , appears strongly underestimated ( _ e.g. _ up to 50% in ref .  [ ) ] .    in view of the above",
    ", i propose that the source of this discrepancy may lie in neglect of many - body interactions .",
    "previous molecular dynamics simulations of systems consisting of 108 particles interacting via _ ab initio _ pair potential and axilrod - teller - muto ( atm ) interaction indicated that a triple - dipole interaction does not affect the bulk viscosity of liquid xenon near its triple point @xcite and dense gaseous krypton @xcite .",
    "however , the error in the values of bulk viscosity obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of the systems with such a small number of particles can be quite large .",
    "for example , the values of the reduced bulk viscosity of the lennard - jones systems consisting of 128 and 256 particles at the reduced temperature @xmath4 and the reduced density @xmath5 , reported in refs  , range from 0.89 to 1.47 , with the ratio of the latter to the former of 1.65 .",
    "this paper presents the results of more accurate molecular dynamics simulations of a liquid consisting of 1372 argon atoms with _ ab initio_+atm interaction , which demonstrate that bulk viscosity , determined from green - kubo formulae , significantly changes with the account of three - body interaction , moving results towards experimental data .",
    "nasrabad _ et al _ @xcite undertook a monte carlo simulation of argon using combination of _ ab initio _ pair interaction @xcite and atm triple - dipole dispersion interaction @xcite to test their ability to predict vapor - liquid equilibrium . although more accurate _",
    "ab initio _",
