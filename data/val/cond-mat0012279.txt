    "shallow impurities in doped semiconductors @xcite can be described in terms of a hydrogenic hamiltonian with an effective mass given by the band mass , and a coulomb potential screened by the dielectric constant of the host semiconductor . while the``effective mass '' equation is slightly more complicated for donors in indirect band - gap semiconductors , and for acceptors a matrix version of a generalized hydrogen problem is obtained , these differences change details , but not the basic physics . therefore , the hydrogenic model is a useful guide for studying and understanding interactions between impurities in doped semiconductors @xcite@xmath0@xcite . at low concentrations",
    "the interactions between impurity centers can be modelled in terms of an exchange hamiltonian involving , as the dominant term @xcite , pairwise heisenberg exchange corresponding to the hydrogen molecule problem @xcite , where the exchange interactions are known to be anti - ferromagnetic at all distances @xcite .    in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , a small fraction of the nonmagnetic ions that form the lattice",
    "are replaced by magnetic ions such as mn or fe .",
    "several features ( such as variable band gaps , optical response , spin polarized transport , as well as the unusual magnetic behaviour analyzed in this paper ) have turned dms into a topic of considerable interest during recent years . in the low doping regime ( _ i.e. _ carrier density below the mott transition )",
    ", the susceptibility ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 ) _ vs. _ magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) curve of such a dms displays a curious double - step feature @xcite . to understand the properties of dms with dopants , it is not only necessary to understand the direct interactions between the dopants , but also the interactions with the magnetic ions which by themselves contain low lying degrees of freedom .",
    "when the magnetic ions are dilute , their direct interactions are unimportant .",
    "thus , for example , the problem of a single shallow impurity in a dms is well described in terms of an exchange interaction between the bound carrier ( electron or hole ) and the magnetic ion , and is known from extensive studies to lead to the formation of a bound magnetic polaron ( bmp ) @xcite .",
    "the spins of the magnetic impurity ions within one effective bohr radius of a dopant interact _ via _ a sizable exchange with the carrier , thus becoming aligned and forming large - spin polarons . the polarons align with an external magnetic field before the individual magnetic ions do , thus giving rise to the two - step susceptibility curve . by analyzing the step due to bmps ( fitting it to a curie - weiss form ) , a ferromagnetic interraction between the polarons can be deduced .",
    "however this result seems puzzling : in non - magnetic semiconductors carrier virtual hopping invariably yields anti - ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "the problem was analyzed by durst , bhatt and wolff @xcite@xmath0@xcite . in their work",
    "they showed that a ferromagnetic interraction between the polarons can be obtained if one considers the overlap of two polarons formed around two dopants .",
    "the two carriers compete over the spins in the overlapping region . for certain values of the model parameters",
    "the indirect carrier - magnetic ion - carrier interaction becomes stronger than the direct carrier exchange , and the polarons align resulting in ferromagnetism .    the current work approaches the problem from a different perspective .",
    "the polarons are considered as non - overlapping , and their effect on the dopant atom is taken into account through a local magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "a system of two such polarons is analyzed _ via _ a generalized hubbard - type hamiltonian , where hopping ( matrix element @xmath4 ) and coulomb interaction ( energy u ) are turned on .",
    "several cases are considered ( dopants with a single bound state and with several bound excited states ) .",
    "ferromagnetic behaviour is seen to emerge when the carrier is allowed to hop between the ground state of one dopant atom and excited states of the other dopant .",
    "numerical work supports the conclusion that such a ferromagnetic interaction is indeed possible in realistic conditions .",
    "we then discuss the applicability of a heisenberg - type model for two interacting polarons . in the moderately high field domain @xmath5 ,",
    "an effective heisenberg hamiltonian is found which contains a mixing of the magnetic fields at the two sites .",
    "our model consists of two identical atoms , with several bound states , in arbitrary local magnetic fields . we allow for hopping of the carriers between the two atoms .",
    "the local magnetic fields represent the exchange fields due to the magnetic ions at each site . as",
    "the number of magnetic ions around each site is large , and the doping is considered uniform , we assume that the magnitudes of the magnetic fields at the two sites are equal . however , the directions of the two fields are allowed to be arbitrary .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian we study has the general form :    @xmath6    where @xmath3 is the magnitude of the field , @xmath7 is the ( arbitrary ) direction , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the labels for the two hydrogenic centers and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the labels for the two electrons .    if we consider a hubbard - like approximation@xcite with one energy level per impurity site and no magnetic fields , the hamiltonian becomes ( in second quantized form ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are labels for the two impurity sites , @xmath14 is the annihilation operator for the state on impurity @xmath8 with up - spin , @xmath15 is the occupation number , @xmath16 _ etc . _",
    "if we also introduce arbitrary number of energy levels on each impurity atom , the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubbnoh ] ) turns into : @xmath17 where @xmath18 indexes the impurity sites ; @xmath19 the atomic levels on each impurity ; @xmath20 the spin degree of freedom ; @xmath21 the energy of level @xmath22 ; and @xmath23 the coulomb interaction energy of electrons in states @xmath22 and @xmath24 on the same impurity atom .",
    "finally , if at each site we consider the arbitrary magnetic fields @xmath25 , and we quantize spin along the axes of the local magnetic fields ( _ i.e. _ @xmath26 creates an electron in the @xmath22-th state on impurity @xmath8 with spin parallel to @xmath27 ) , the hubbard hamiltonian becomes : @xmath28 we caution the reader that in this case the transition matrix elements @xmath29 become dependent on the angle @xmath30 between the two magnetic fields @xmath31 .",
    "we will discuss the relationship between eqs .",
    "[ fullhubb],[fullhubb1],[hubbnoh ] and eq .",
    "[ allh ] in more detail in the concluding section .",
    "several models of increasing complexity were considered : atoms with a single bound state and without magnetic fields ( sec .",
    "[ reghub ] ) , atoms with a single bound state in arbitrary magnetic fields ( sec . [ reghubfields ] ) , atoms with several excited states in arbitrary magnetic fields ( sec . [ 2levhub ] ) .",
    "the ground state of the two - center system is shown to undergo a transition from an antiferromagnetic state ( singlet ) to a fully ferromagnetic ( triplet ) configuration with the increase of the effective polaron magnetic field ( sec .",
    "[ gsmagn ] ) .",
    "the results for a regular heisenberg hamiltonian where the two spins are in arbitrary fixed fields are calculated as well and compared with those derived from our model ( sec .",
    "[ regheis ] ) .",
    "finally we find a modified heisenberg type hamiltonian that agrees with our model in the moderately high field regime ( sec .",
    "[ modif ] ) .",
    "the hubbard model of the hydrogen molecule @xcite ( see eq .",
    "[ hubbnoh ] ) consists of two hydrogenic ( one - electron ) centers , each with one single electron bound state of energy @xmath32 .",
    "electrons are allowed to hop between the two sites , subject to the restrictions imposed by the pauli principle with a hopping matrix element @xmath4 .",
    "each center also has one two - electron state , with energy @xmath33 , where @xmath34 represents the interaction energy between two electrons on the same atom .    in this case",
    "we can decouple the spin-@xmath10 and spin-@xmath35 subspaces ( since there is no connection between states of different spin ) .",
    "it turns out that the spectrum of eigenvalues is @xmath36 ( triple degenerate ) for spin-@xmath10 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for spin-@xmath35 .",
    "the ground state therefore has spin @xmath35 ( _ i.e. _ the interaction between the electrons can be thought of as anti - ferromagnetic ) .",
    "if two arbitrary fixed fields ( of strengths @xmath40 and @xmath41 and making an angle @xmath30 ) are applied at the two sites , the analysis becomes more complicated ( see eq .",
    "[ fullhubb ] , and consider that there is a single level , @xmath42 , on each impurity ) .",
    "we can quantize the spins along the axes of the fields , and we can pick as a basis : @xmath43 each element in the basis is anti - symmetrized , for example @xmath44 this basis obviously is not formed of eigenstates of the total spin , but only of the @xmath45-component of the spin .",
    "the new hamiltonian matrix ( ignoring @xmath46 , the bohr magneton , for simplicity ) is shown in eq .",
    "[ hhubb1 ] below :    @xmath47    we next make the simplifying assumption that @xmath48 . for the case of dms , since the magnetic ion distribution is random , this can be justified if each polaron has several ( n ) magnetic ions producing the exchange field on the carrier , so @xmath49 . in this case",
    "we obtain two pairs of degenerate states @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by making a @xmath52 degree rotation within each of the degenerate subspaces , and by multiplying some of the basis vectors by @xmath22",
    "when necessary , we single out two of the eigenvalues ( @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) , the rest of the matrix having the simpler form in eq .",
    "[ hhubbard1 ]    @xmath53    this hamiltonian can be solved by perturbation theory ( pt ) . in the limit @xmath54 the upper three states become degenerate and",
    "the problem needs to be handled by degenerate perturbation theory",
    ". we will not investigate this limit any further . in the high field",
    "limit however , the magnetic field removes the degeneracy and we can obtain the eigenvalues to second order by regular pt .",
    "thus we obtain for the lowest eigenvalues :    @xmath55      by solving the same problem ( two atoms in fixed external fields ) using a heisenberg hamiltonian , and comparing the eignevalues with the results obtained above in eq .",
    "[ ehubbard1 ] , one can see how the effective exchange parameter in the heisenberg hamiltonian is affected by external magnetic fields .",
    "we start with @xcite : @xmath56 we can again quantize the spins along the axes of the two fields , and work in the basis    @xmath57 which yields the hamiltonian matrix : @xmath58 after we do a rotation by @xmath52 degrees in the @xmath51 subspace we can apply perturbation theory ( considering @xmath59 as a small parameter ) , which yields ( after subtracting @xmath59 ) the eigenvalues :    @xmath60    by matching the results in eq .",
    "[ ehubbard1 ] to those in eq .",
    "[ eheisenberg ] in the @xmath61 limit ( ignoring @xmath62 ) we can make the identification : @xmath63 however , when the field is increased , the matching is not perfect anymore , and the effective exchange parameter for the ground state is reduced to @xmath64 thus the appearence of polarons decreases the effective anti - ferromagnetic exchange between the carriers .",
    "one can improve this analysis by considering a more realistic model .",
    "the next simplest case is to consider two energy levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( energies @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) on each atom , and to allow hopping @xmath67,@xmath68 and @xmath69 between sites .",
    "again we consider arbitrary fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the hamiltonian is still given by eq .",
    "[ fullhubb ] with the summation for @xmath22 going over @xmath70 .",
    "the number of states increases dramatically : we are dealing now with a @xmath71 matrix ( @xmath72since there are 6 pairs of different spatial states which each can have spin @xmath35 or @xmath10 , and 4 pairs of identical states which can only have spin @xmath35 ) .",
    "we need to concentrate on the lowest energy states only , treating the rest perturbatively .",
    "we ignore the @xmath69 hopping , since it affects the lowest eigenvalues only to higher order in pt .",
    "we are using again the simplifying assumption @xmath48 .",
    "the lowest energy subspace can be identified as being spanned by @xmath73 . by applying second order",
    "degenerate pt in this subspace , we obtain the following expressions for the eigenvalues : @xmath74    one can see that in the limit @xmath75 we obtain the same results as in the @xmath10-level hubbard model analyzed in the beginning . this is a good consistency check .      by applying second order perturbation theory to the @xmath11-level hubbard model ( and considering @xmath76 ) , we therefore obtain the following expression for the ground - state energy : @xmath77 the angle @xmath30 between the two fields was regarded up to this point as an external parameter .",
    "all the calculations so far were done under the assumption that the magnetic field was fixed externally .",
    "we must take however into account the fact that the field is generated by the actual polaron , and that although the magnitude of the field is fixed by the size of the polaron , the direction is free to change . therefore , when @xmath78 , @xmath30 takes the value that minimizes the energy .",
    "since @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the two values that minimize the value of the energy are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , depending of the sign of the factor @xmath83 .",
    "we can regard @xmath84 , which represents the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the anti - ferromagnetic configurations , as an effective exchange constant . for small values of the polaron field",
    "it is the anti - ferromagnetic state that dominates , whereas if we increase the polaron field the ground state of the system becomes ferromagnetic .    in order to get an idea of what parameters are essential for the transition ,",
    "let us solve @xmath85 , which is just a quadratic equation .",
    "the critical field is given by the only acceptable ( positive ) root : @xmath86 where we have defined @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the one - level limit , thus , the transition disappears ( we have @xmath89 ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic configuration happens then as a consequence of the local magnetic fields _ and _ of the hopping to excited states . as a side remark",
    "we observe that while @xmath90 depends entirely on the type of dopant used , @xmath91 depends both on the type of dopant _ and _ on the dopant density ( since all the transition probabilities depend on the separation of the atoms ) .",
    "thus we may have a transition from a polaron ferromagnetic to an anti - ferromagnetic ground state configuration as the density is varied .",
    "it turns out that for the @xmath11-level ( hydrogenic ground state and any excited state ) approximation , @xmath91 can take virtually any value from @xmath92 for @xmath35 separation , to @xmath93 when the separation becomes infinite",
    ".      one can generalize the results presented above about the ground - state of a @xmath11-level hubbard model to the case where any number of bound excited states exists .",
    "consider @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( with energies @xmath21 ) to be the @xmath10-electron states , indexed by the subscript @xmath22 ( @xmath96 for the ground - state ) .",
    "we consider the ground - state to be non - degenerate , however allowing arbitrary degeneracies for all the other states .",
    "the ground - state of the two - electron system in a magnetic field is then : @xmath97 , with energy ( in the @xmath35-th order ) @xmath98 .",
    "we allow the hopping of an electron from the ground state of one atom to any state of the other atom , the coupling constants between @xmath99 and @xmath100 being given by @xmath101 .",
    "expression [ fullhubb ] gives the right hamiltonian with the summation for @xmath91 being over @xmath13 , corresponding to only two interacting polarons .",
    "the couplings of the ground - state @xmath102 to various other states are given in table [ coupltable ] .",
    "applying second order non - degenerate pt , we obtain for the ground state energy : @xmath103    we can apply the same kind of analysis as for the two - level case above , however @xmath83 , the effective exchange constant whose sign dictates the magnetic configuration now becomes : @xmath104    .the couplings of the ground state of the many - level hubbard model to various excited states [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the value of the critical field above which the ferromagnetic configuration becomes energetically favorable is again given by the equation @xmath105 , however this can not be solved analytically anymore .",
    "we can understand the details of this change of magnetic configuration better if we derive the actual couplings and coulomb terms from a simplified model of the dopant . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", one can use simple hydrogenic models : two h atoms separated by a distance @xmath106 in magnetic fields @xmath107 .",
    "we obtained the 2-center overlap integrals ( @xmath101 ) by using explicit machine - readable formulas that have been constructed by applying symbolic calculation to the @xmath108-function method of barnett and coulson .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath10-center coulomb integrals ( @xmath109 ) was done following an approach described in some textbooks@xcite .",

    "figure [ ah1 ] plots the effective exchange @xmath84 as a function of separation @xmath116 between the two centers , for a fixed value of the polaron effective field , @xmath117ry , which is still small compared to the rydberg .",
    "it can be seen that the effective exchange @xmath84 becomes positive at a certain dopant separation @xmath116 and thus the favorable configuration becomes ferromagnetic .",
    "figure [ hcrit ] plots the critical field @xmath118 as a function of the dopant separation @xmath116 . for @xmath119 , which is true for typical experimental doping densities , the minimal value of the polaron field that will provide a ferromagnetic interaction becomes reasonable ( a few tenth of a rydberg ) and",
    "therefore we can conclude that our model predicts ferromagnetic interractions between polarons in dms .",
    "coming back to our fixed magnetic field model , we note that both the @xmath10- and @xmath11-level hubbard models agree with the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "however when those contributions are taken into account , the eq .",

    "the question to be asked is whether it is possible to modify the hamiltonian so as to have agreement up to @xmath62 .",
    "it turns out that this is indeed possible .    if we expand the terms in eq .",
    "[ ehubbard1 ] we obtain the energies : @xmath120    we need to add some small correction to eq .",
    "[ heis ] that is linear in the fields and reproduces the above structure .",

    "it turns out that the hamiltonian @xmath124 reproduces the right structure . in the basis",
    "@xmath125 it becomes :    @xmath126    after doing the necessary @xmath52 degree rotation in the @xmath51 subspace the matrix becomes suitable for pt and it yields the eigenvalues ( to first order in @xmath59 and @xmath91 and after subtracting a common @xmath59 ) : @xmath127    by matching the results in eq .",
    "[ neweheisenberg ] to eq .",
    "[ newehubbard1 ] we obtain for the parameters of the modified hamiltonian : @xmath128 one can also expand the result for the @xmath11-level hubbard model to get a better estimate for the parameters . in that case one",
    "obtains : @xmath129",
    "the calculations presented above lead us to two conclusions :    they confirm once more the fact that the polarons formed in dilute magnetic semiconductors can interact ferromagnetically for certain dopant densities and types .",
    "this extends the results obtained by @xcite@xmath0@xcite in the limit that the polarons have an important overlap to the situation where the two polarons do not overlap at all .",
    "thus , the two qualitatively distinct effects combine in order to generate an effective ferromagnetic interaction of the bound magnetic polarons in a dms .    for the case where two @xmath10-electron atoms are placed in",
    "fixed , but nonparallel external magnetic fields , the standard model with heisenberg exchange and zeeman terms is not a suitable approximation.instead , the calculations above give a correction , with which we are able to reproduce the correct spectrum in the moderately high field domain @xmath130 .",
    "the correction represents an effective mixing of the fields at the two sites , which can be intuitively understood as a `` transfer '' of the field from one site to the other by the hopping electron . in the high field domain @xmath131 , this correction is not valid anymore and the correct model is a heisenberg hamiltonian with a field - dependent exchange constant .",
    "we will return now to conclusion i with a few remarks .",
    "the change from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic effective coupling in the presence of strong local fields in the generalized hubbard model naturally leads one to the question whether this would actually occur in an exact calculation .",
    "we believe it does , though the parameter values for the change are likely to be different .",
    "to explain our `` belief '' , we consider the case of the hydrogen molecule problem in zero field , where the issue of the effective heisenberg hamiltonian has been thoroughly discussed @xcite@xmath0",
    "@xcite @xmath0 @xcite@xmath0 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ js ] we plot the effective exchange parameter as a function of @xmath132 in the range 1 - 8 , as calculated in four different ways .",
    "the solid line represents the herring - flicker@xcite ( hf ) result , @xmath133 ry , which is asymptotically exact ( in the sense that @xmath134 as @xmath135 ) , while the dots are the numerically converged results of kolos and wolniewicz @xcite ( kw ) .",
    "both show that @xmath136 is positive ( antiferromagnetic ) for all @xmath137 .",
    "the dashed line is the result of the heitler - london @xcite ( hl ) approximation , which , though clearly not exact , works reasonably well on this logarithmic plot for the range shown .",
    "it should be noted , however , that while the hl result has the right sign of @xmath136 for the range of @xmath138 shown , it incorrectly predicts a negative @xmath136 at large @xmath138 because it does not take into account polarization corrections to the ground state hydrogenic wavefunction .",
    "finally , as the dot - dashed curve , is the standard hubbard model result , @xmath139 , with @xmath140 ry and @xmath141 ry , calculated within the ground state approximation for the hydrogen wavefunctions ( the generalized hubbard model would give the same result in this case without external fields , as adding excited states does not alter the second order splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet states ) .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the hubbard approximation overestimates @xmath142 by a large factor ( this qualitative fact does not change with more refined estimates for @xmath143 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "the reason for the larger exchange is that hubbard , and hubbard - like approximations , consider only the kinetic exchange ( due to the hopping process ) , which is antiferromagnetic , and neglect coulomb exchange which tends to favor ferromagnetism .",
    "( such a split is often used in literature@xcite ) .",
    "the latter _ is _ included in the  exact \" hf / kw treatment , as well as the hl approximation , resulting in a much lower value net ( antiferromagnetic ) exchange .",
    "we expect that inclusion of local magnetic fields @xmath144 of equal magnitude ( @xmath3 ) , which couple _ only _ to the electron spin is properly captured on a qualitative / semi - quantitative level by the extended hubbard model",
    ". therefore inclusion of such fields in a more accurate model will also result in a movement of the kinetic exchange towards ferromagnetism ; consequently , the overall exchange will change over to ferromagnetic at some value of @xmath3 .",
    "if we just add a field independent ( ferromagnetic ) coulomb term to the kinetic exchange of the generalized hubbard model , the change from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism would be expected at lower values of @xmath3 than we have calculated , and make the effect we consider more relevant for dms systems .",
    "we caution , though , that for the purely hydrogenic problem with local fields , one must take into account the effect of the magnetic field on the orbital wavefunction as well , and that will certainly affect the results , at least quantitatively .",
    "in the case of dms , the local fields represent exchange fields due to interaction of hydrogenic states with local atomic states of the magnetic ion ( mn ) , and therefore their orbital effect is _ not _ the same as that of external magnetic fields in the @xmath145 problem .",
    "nevertheless , we expect these to have some effect on the orbital part of the wavefunction of the hydrogenic impurity @xcite , which would have at least a quantitative effect on our results .",
    "this research was supported by nsf dmr-9809483 .",
    "the reader is cautioned that the one - particle wavefunctions are restricted to compact nonoverlapping regions around each polaron .",
    "the only allowed two - particle states are those with the two electrons in two different such regions . @xmath152 and @xmath153 are total spin operators defined on the regions around polaron @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ."
