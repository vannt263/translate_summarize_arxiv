    "in order to better characterize the distribution of luminosity in the stellar components of disk galaxies , we are conducting a detailed study of edge - on disk galaxies with a range of bulge - to - disk ratio using deep ccd surface photometry .",
    "our galaxies range in hubble type from s0 to scd , and in bulge - to - disk - ratio from 20 ( ngc 3115 ) to 0.03 ( ngc 4244 , this work & @xcite ) .",
    "we will re - examine the structure of their bright disks and bulges , and also study , for the first time , the structure of faint outer components such as thick disks and stellar halos .",
    "these faint outer components are important because they may trace the history of the galaxy , either because they contain the oldest stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) or because they were formed via accretions of smaller galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , if they are made of old stars , they should provide connections to high - z galaxy observations , both direct ( @xcite ) and indirect via absorption line studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest galaxies structurally are those of late type ",
    "sc and later .",
    "to first order , they comprise simply a disk with exponential surface brightness falloff ( @xcite , van der kruit & searle 1981 ) .",
    "we have already studied a large sc galaxy , ngc  5907 ( morrison et al . 1994 ) .",
    "our analysis confirmed previous findings on its thin disk ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) , but we found an unusual second component , whose luminosity falls off very slowly with radius ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) for sc galaxies is very broad , and peaked at total blue luminosity ( @xmath7 ) of 19.5 ( @xcite ) , making ngc 5907 ( @xmath8 , @xcite ) an unusually luminous sc galaxy , we have also studied ngc  4244 , a smaller late - type spiral whose total magnitude of 18.4 @xmath9 mag ( @xcite ) is almost a magnitude below the broad peak of the field sc lf .",
    "ngc  4244 has hubble type scd , is located 3.6 mpc away ( tully - fisher , @xcite ) , and has a flat rotation curve with @xmath10  km / s ( @xcite ) . beyond the optical disk ,",
    "ngc  4244 has a declining rotation curve ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present deep surface photometry of ngc  4244 .",
    "our data reach reliably to @xmath11 = 27.5 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 , significantly fainter than our previous published data on ngc 5907 .",
    "questions that we will address using this extremely deep data are :    * do small late - type disk galaxies such as ngc 4244 have similar properties to large ones such as ngc 5907 ? * what are the properties of ngc 4244 s luminous thin disk ? does the stellar disk have a distinct edge ? what is its vertical scale height ?",
    "does this scale height remain constant with radius ? *",
    "does ngc 4244 show fainter components like a thick disk or halo , or like ngc  5907 s unusual second component ?",
    "ngc  4244 is less massive than a typical sc : the total mass of ngc  4244 is 9.77 x 10@xmath12 ( @xcite ) , whereas the average total mass of an sc is @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the h  i mass fraction @xmath14 ( @xcite ) is fairly typical for an sc galaxy : 0.14 .",
    "the mean @xmath14 for a typical sc ( from @xcite ) is 0.1 .",
    "the mass fraction of h@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is low in ngc  4244 , relative to other galaxies of the same mass . in his co study",
    ", @xcite found @xmath17 , which placed ngc  4244 in his mass class iii , for which @xmath18 = 8.4 x 10@xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the current star formation rate in ngc 4244 is also low , as can be seen from its low x - ray , radio continuum , and iras emission ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the hubble type of a galaxy is known to correlate roughly with its environment in the sense that late - type galaxies are found in more isolated areas ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we might expect to see a correlation between the existence of thick disks and galaxy environment if the accretion theory of thick disk formation is correct .",
    "ngc  4244 lies in the coma - centaurus spur , and is thought to be a member of the cvn  i ( @xcite ) or b4 ( @xcite ) group .",
    "its small distance makes group membership very difficult to decide , since group peculiar velocities are of the same size as the hubble flow .",
    "we have plotted in figure [ enviro ] supergalactic coordinates of galaxies in the b4 and nearby b5 groups of kraan - kortweg & tammann  it is not clear whether these two groups are separate entities .",
    "we can only conclude from these data that ngc  4244 lives in a relatively isolated environment , with only three galaxies of similar or greater brightness within @xmath21  2 mpc ( ngc  4449 , ngc  4736 , ngc  4826 ) , the brightest of which ( ngc  4736 ) has m@xmath22 = @xmath2319.37 mag , 1.7 mag brighter than ngc  4244 .",
    "@xcite used photographic surface photometry of ngc  4244 to study its structure , finding the disk well modeled by a radial exponential function and a vertical sech@xmath24 function , with a sharp cutoff at 5.3 radial scale lengths .",
    "they found no evidence for a thick disk , in contrast to their studies of disk galaxies with larger b / d ratios where thick disks were seen .",
    "however , thick disks are very faint , compared to both the night sky and the light of the younger , thin disks , and , thus , detection and accurate determinations of the properties of thick disks from photographic work are difficult",
    ". the improved precision of ccds is needed , and our faint ccd photometry of ngc 4244 will put much stronger limits on the existence of a thick disk in this galaxy .",
    "the flaring of a galaxy s stellar disk gives constraints on the balance between the gravitational potential the disk experiences and heating mechanisms the stars experience .",
    "van der kruit & searle ( 1981a , b,1982a , b ) found that stellar disks in the galaxies they studied had constant scale heights with radius , although this has recently been challenged ( de  grijs & peltier 1997 ) .",
    "ngc  4244 is a good galaxy in which to study disk flaring , as it has no large companions and no apparent thick disk ( cf . van der kruit & searle 1981a ) .",
    "we will discuss the strong limits our data place on any variation of disk scale height with radius .",
    "the ngc  4244 data were obtained over a five night run in march 1997 and a six night run in april 1997 using the 24/36   burrell schmidt telescope at kitt peak national observatory . the images were taken using a 2048x2048 frontside - illuminated tektronix ccd ( s2ka ) mounted at newtonian focus . with this setup",
    ", the field of view is 69 square arcmin , with each 21 @xmath25 m pixel imaging 2.@xmath2603 of sky .",
    "the gain was set to 2.5 e@xmath27/adu and the readout noise was 3 e@xmath27 ( 1.2  adu ) .",
    "all exposures were made through a harris @xmath0 filter .",
    "observations were performed in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "half of the time was used observing the galaxy and the other half was used to obtain dark sky flats .",
    "the dark sky flat images were taken at approximately the same hour angle and declination as the galaxy images .",
    "over the course of the two observing runs , 66 galaxy images and 70 dark sky flats were obtained .",
    "for all of the galaxy and sky images , the exposure time was 600  s. conditions were photometric throughout the observing runs .",
    "overscan removal and bias subtraction were done in the standard manner .",
    "then `` master '' sky flats were constructed from the dark sky images from each run .",
    "the individual sky flats were dithered by @xmath28 , so that wings from bright stars in the field would not appear in the final , combined image . to construct the master sky flat",
    ", we used an iterative procedure .",
    "we scaled the individual sky images by their mode .",
    "prescaling was important because , even during photometric conditions , the sky brightness varied by @xmath210.3 mag .",
    "this was likely due to the long tail to high wavelength of the harris ( cousins ) @xmath0 filter , which includes some of the strong airglow lines , combined with the change in sky brightness with zenith distance .",
    "then , we combined the individual , scaled , sky images , using iraf s ccdclip algorithm , which uses ccd properties to estimate expected variations in data values and removed pixels which differed from the median by more than 2@xmath29 .",
    "each of the individual sky frames was divided by the flatfield frame to reduce the width of the distribution of sky values and so make rejection of outliers due to faint stars and stellar wings more accurate .",
    "a plane was fit to each of the individual flat - fielded sky frames and subtracted from the sky frame .",
    "the modes were recalculated , and the entire procedure repeated .",
    "this procedure was repeated until no improvement was seen in the master sky flat ( ten times in this case ) .",
    "the 66 galaxy images were dithered by @xmath30 , much less than for the sky flats .",
    "the individual galaxy images were flatfielded using the master sky flat and registered .",
    "we combined the individual galaxy images , using a median . in figure",
    "[ final ] we show our final galaxy image , after subtracting a best fit plane sky and correcting to airmass 1 .",
    "one landolt standard star field ( @xcite ) was observed each night , giving us 26 well - exposed standard stars with a range in color and airmass . a photometric zero point of @xmath0",
    "= 22.23 @xmath3 0.03 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 corresponding to 1 adu / sec / pixel was determined .",
    "for a 600 s exposure , this yields @xmath0 = 29.18 @xmath3 0.03 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 corresponding to 1 adu / exposure / pixel . as our exposures were only taken in one filter , we can not add a color term to our calibration but estimate its magnitude as less than 0.10 mag over the color range of our standards ( see figure [ stds ] , @xmath31 = @xmath230.06 to 1.66 mag , @xmath32 = 0.05 to 0.8 ) .",
    "in fact , over the expected color range of the relatively old populations we will be studying , the color term is well below the uncertainty in the zero point .    the average sky brightness , 1998.0 adu / pixel ( see section 3.2 ) , corresponds to @xmath33 = 20.9 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "for simplification in subsequent analyses , the galaxy has been rotated counter - clockwise by 42@xmath34 .",
    "this agrees well with olling s ( 1996a ) determination of @xmath2348@xmath34 for the position angle of ngc  4244 .      in order to reach the faintest possible surface brightness level in the galaxy",
    ", we masked out the foreground stars and background galaxies in our field .",
    "to characterize the stars we used daophot ( @xcite ) to determine the positions and magnitudes of all of the stars within the frame . using 48 bright , but unsaturated , stars , we determined the point spread function ( psf ) for stars in the frame .",
    "we followed the method described in stetson ( 1987 ) , iterating until a clean subtraction within a 15x15 pixel box centered on the psf star was obtained .",
    "our aim was not to determine accurate photometry of all of the stars within the frame , but to mask the stars out to a constant level in surface brightness .",
    "this means that we paid particular attention to the outer wings of our psf .",
    "we used this psf to construct a radial profile and masked all pixels for which a foreground star contributed at least 1 adu .",
    "the stellar radial profile was well determined out to the psf radius , 15 pixels ( 30@xmath35 ) .",
    "the psf is axisymmetric and varies along the chip .",
    "the variation is most significant for the central regions of the stars and does not strongly affect the outer wings of the stars , which are formed by processes such as scattering in the atmosphere and telescope .",
    "we describe the psf beyond 15 pixels in section 3.4 .",
    "background galaxies and undetected stars were masked by hand using the iraf task imedit .",
    "special care was taken with stars near the galaxy , where the galaxy s luminosity gradient interferes with daophot s sky fitting algorithm .",
    "ngc  4244 has a small dust lane and several visible regions . to mask these , a dust mask 20 pixels wide , running along the major axis , was created . in figure [ maskd ]",
    "we show the galaxy with our final mask superimposed .    using this mask ,",
    "the data were binned up into regions whose size varied from a resolution element near the galaxy s center to 50  x  50 pixels in the regions far from its center .",
    "this procedure used a robust averaging scheme to compensate for any unmasked stars , galaxies , etc . and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "accurate sky subtraction is crucial for the faint isophotes . to determine the sky level , we used the masked image and made a histogram of sky values in bins well away from the galaxy , using bins with more than 100 pixels after masking .",
    "there are 310 such bins . using a histogram of the sky values within these bins , we determined the sky value to be 1998.0 @xmath3 0.8  adu . in figure [ histsky ]",
    ", we show this histogram .",
    "the width of the histogram provides a measure of the contribution of unmasked stars to the sky level .",
    "our photometry reaches reliably to 27.5 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the error model is described in appendix a. to illustrate , we work through the errors in a 13 x 3 pixel bin , centered 12 pixels ( 425 pc ) from the major axis and 150 pixels ( 5.3 kpc ) from the minor axis . in this bin , the mean number of counts is @xmath36 adu per pixel , with the mean number of counts from the galaxy alone @xmath37 adu per pixel .",
    "the errors are summarized in table [ galerr ] .",
    "the dominant source of error in the thin disk region of the galaxy is the error arising from surface brightness fluctuations within ngc  4244 , because ngc 4244 is so close to the milky way ( its distance is 3.6 mpc ; note that it is marginally resolved even from the ground . )",
    "surface brightness fluctuations dominate the formal errors wherever @xmath38 ( i.e. up to 1.6 kpc above the plane ) . in the faintest region of the galaxy ( above 1.6 kpc from the plane ) , the main sources of error are large - scale flat - fielding errors and sky variations .    [ galerr ]      to see how much scattered light from the central part of the galaxy contributes at high - z , we constructed a stellar profile out to 150 pixels ( 5.3  kpc ) . in the center",
    ", we used the stellar profile constructed using daophot ( section [ ming ] ) .",
    "for the outer region , we used two saturated stars . using stars whose centers were saturated means that the signal - to - noise in the outer wings is higher than in unsaturated stars .",
    "we masked the stars in the wings of the saturated stars , as well as diffraction spikes around the saturated stars .",
    "the unmasked pixels were averaged in radial annuli .",
    "the profiles from the two saturated stars were averaged and joined to the daophot psf profile .",
    "the combined profile was normalized to the surface brightness of the central bright region of ngc  4244 .",
    "the final profile is shown in figure [ psf ] . at a distance of 2  kpc ( 56  pixels ) from galaxy center ,",
    "the scattered light from the bulge is @xmath39  28.5 magnitudes arcsec@xmath1 , below our quoted photometric limit of @xmath40   magnitudes arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is not a significant effect .",
    "we fit a single exponential disk to the data : @xmath41 ( here @xmath42 is the central density of the disk in @xmath43  pc@xmath44 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional modeling is described fully in @xcite .",
    "we start with a full three - dimensional model , and then for each iteration of the fit , we numerically integrate along the line of sight and produce a two - dimensional model , which we compare with the observed surface brightness .",
    "we start out with eight parameters : the scale length and scale height @xmath4 and @xmath2 , inclination @xmath45 , the coordinates of the galaxy center @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the radial extent of the galaxy @xmath5 , the central surface brightness @xmath48 , and the sky value . because of high correlations among the parameters , eight free parameters are extremely difficult to fit accurately , but , fortunately , some of the parameters can be fixed using other information . the sky value is determined by averaging the values in any bin with more than 100 pixels , away from the galaxy , as described in section 3.2 .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 position of the center of the galaxy and @xmath5 are determined from a contour plot of the galaxy and by making one - dimensional profiles across the minor axis and parallel to the major axis .",
    "the inclination @xmath49 was adopted from olling s ( 1996a ) kinematic measurement .",
    "only three parameters then need to be determined from the 2-d fitting of a single exponential disk : @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and central surface brightness .",
    "how well do 2-d fits work ? because we are using a levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( @xcite ) , which is an iterative nonlinear leastsquares algorithm , we need to provide starting values .",
    "we investigated the sensitivity of the algorithm to the initial estimates used by mapping out the value of @xmath50 over a large grid of starting values and noting where the algorithm converged .",
    "we find that if all three parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath48 , are estimated , then the initial estimates need to be within 20% of the correct values for the model fit to converge . if one of the three parameters can be estimated from other information , such as @xmath2 from the 1-d fits , then initial estimates of the other two can be as much as 50% wrong and the model will still converge successfully .",
    "a starting grid of @xmath50 can be used as a `` levenberg - marquardt - by - eye '' to locate the `` trench '' , that is , the starting parameter values for which the model fit will converge .",
    "once the trench has been found , all three parameters are allowed to vary .    as illustration , in figure [ trench ] , we show a contour plot of @xmath50 for fixed @xmath2 = 6.5 pixels ( 233 pc ) .",
    "the contours are logarithmic ; steep slopes are even steeper than they appear . for all starting values of @xmath4 and @xmath48 shown on the plot , except upper left ( @xmath51 ) , lower left ( @xmath52 ) , and lower",
    "right ( @xmath53 ) corners , the starting model will converge .",
    "however , for @xmath2 values which are more than @xmath54% from the true @xmath2 , the initial values of @xmath4 and @xmath48 need to be within @xmath3950% of the true values .",
    "another concern is the reliability of the estimates once the algorithm has converged .",
    "@xcite showed that estimates based on the covariance matrix of the fit can underestimate the true values severely .",
    "thus , to determine error estimates on the derived disk parameters @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath48 , we used bootstrapping with resampling ( @xcite , chapter 15 of @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we ran our 2-d model fitting program 1000 times .",
    "each time , the data to be fit were chosen by random sampling with replacement from the actual data .",
    "the sets of resulting disk parameters were roughly gaussian distributions , centered on the result of the run using all of the data .",
    "the errors estimated from the widths of bootstrapping analysis are more reasonable estimates of our true errors , as the bootstrapping errors include not only the formal errors from known contributions but also a more realistic estimate of goodness of fit and systematics ( unmasked foreground stars , dust , and small , faint , background galaxies ) . in figure",
    "[ hist ] , we show a histogram of @xmath2 values estimated by our bootstrapping code .    in table",
    "[ twod ] , we show the results of our 2-d fitting with the bootstrapping errors , as well as the correlation coefficients between all the variables . to determine all of the correlation coefficients ,",
    "all eight variables were started at their correct values and allowed to vary .",
    "the important correlation coefficients are those between the first three variables , the scale length @xmath4 , the scale height @xmath2 , and the central surface brightness @xmath555 . for comparison to other galaxies ,",
    "the face - on and edge - on central surface brightnesses for this model are also quoted . ] but the strong correlations between some of the other variables , such as between @xmath2 and inclination , or @xmath5 and @xmath4 , demonstrate why it is important to use other methods to estimate some of the parameters .",
    "[ twod ]    we estimated @xmath5 directly from the image to reduce the effects of these correlations .",
    "unfortunately , the galaxy is not axisymmetric : @xmath5 on the southwest side of ngc  4244 ( left side of figure 4 ) is 8% larger than on the northeast side : 10.5  kpc vs 9.7  kpc .",
    "we chose an intermediate value of 10.0  kpc . using the northeast side ( right side of figure 4 ) only in our estimation , with @xmath5  =  9.7  kpc , results in an estimate of @xmath4 which is 3% larger .",
    "the estimates of @xmath2 and @xmath55 change an insignificant amount .",
    "the bright stars and regions at the left edge of ngc  4244 make it difficult to model the left side only .      in figure [ profiles ] , we show vertical profiles parallel to the minor axis . our best fit model of a single exponential disk with scale height of 246 pc is shown with the data .",
    "a single disk fit is a very good match to the data down to 27.5 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 and there is little evidence for disk flaring , i.e. changing scale height as a function of radius .",
    "the only profile that appears to flare is the one at @xmath3  8.5 kpc .",
    "however , the warp in ngc  4244 starts at @xmath56 kpc and we attribute the apparent flaring to the warp . in the galaxy center , we may have a small contribution to the light from the bulge , which may lead to a slight underestimate of @xmath2 there , due to the steeper bulge profile .    to test the constancy of @xmath2 with radius , we split the galaxy into inner and outer regions , @xmath57  kpc and @xmath58  kpc ( the region outside @xmath598  kpc",
    "was not included to minimize the effect of the small warp ) , and analyzed the two regions separately .",
    "for the inner region , we find @xmath2 = 246 @xmath3 2 pc and , for the outer region , we find @xmath2 = 259 @xmath3 8 pc .",
    "the difference between the inner and outer regions is not significant at the 2@xmath29 level .",
    "this lack of evidence for flaring will be discussed further in section 4.3 .    in figure",
    "[ xp ] and [ xp2 ] , we show profiles parallel to the major axis , at @xmath3 760  pc and at @xmath3 955  pc from the major axis . the horizontal profile at z  =  @xmath3 760  pc is the closest distance to the major where a complete profile can be drawn .",
    "this is because of the large number of pixels masked due to dust , regions , and foreground stars at lower z. in figure [ xp ] , the region further out than @xmath21 7  kpc from the minor axis shows more light than predicted by a single exponential disk fit , as if either the outer regions have a larger scale length @xmath4 or the inclination changes slightly with radius , becoming closer to edge - on for large @xmath0 .",
    "olling s ( 1996a ) data also suggest that the inclination increases slightly with radius .    the profile at z  =  @xmath3 955  pc shows the influence of the warp more clearly .",
    "olling ( 1996a ) found evidence for a warped disk .",
    "he found that the warp starts close to the edge of the optical disk ( @xmath0  =  8.5  kpc ) , as is typical of galaxy warps ( @xcite ) .",
    "the warp extends below the major axis on the left side of the disk and above on the right side in our figure 3 .",
    "@xcite finds that its line of nodes is close to the line of sight . in figure [ xp2 ]",
    ", the warp is apparent for the entire outer half of the disk , starting at 5  kpc from the minor axis , where data from the four quadrants of our image are quite different . in other words , in our faint optical data we see more details of the warped outer disk superimposed on the line of sight than is seen in the data , despite its high quality .",
    "( we do not show data past 7  kpc on the left side because of the presence of a large region of current star formation and three bright stars . )",
    "we also see evidence for a small warp in the outer parts of the stellar disk in our vertical profiles . the line of centers in the vertical profiles changes by @xmath392.5 pixels ( 89  pc ) between the center and the left edge of the disk .",
    "we corrected for this effect before making figure 9 .",
    "this is equivalent to a change of 0.@xmath345 .",
    "the optical warp we find is in the same direction as the warp .",
    "the optical warp in ngc  4244 is much smaller than in ngc  5907 ( morrison et al . 1994 ) or ngc 4565 , which permits accurate study of its outer stellar disk .",
    "@xcite used photographic photometry to obtain thin disk parameters for ngc  4244 and , recently , olling ( 1996a ) reanalyzed their photometry to rederive a disk scale height and disk scale length .",

    "the existence of this stellar cutoff is consistent with the detection by @xcite of faint regions `` at distance twice the optical radius '' of the nearby face - on galaxies they studied .",
    "the `` optical radius '' ( corresponding to a face - on surface brightness @xmath68 = 25 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 ) is an outmoded concept based on what could be detected on photographic ( possi ) sky survey plates ; it is now possible to see much fainter with ccd detectors .",
    "( for edge - on galaxies the situation is , of course , even easier . ) assuming @xmath4/@xmath2 = 10 to convert face - on to edge - on surface brightness , @xmath68 = 25 corresponds to @xmath69 21 .",
    "figure [ profiles ] shows that much of the stellar luminosity of ngc 4244 comes from outside the `` optical radius '' defined in this way .      what determines the thickness of a stellar disk ?",
    "since its brightness varies exponentially with radius and the contribution of dark matter should not be strong in the inner galaxy , the weaker gravitational pull from the outer disk means that we would expect a component whose vertical energy does not vary with radius to flare towards the edges .",
    "this can be seen clearly for ngc 4244 s in fig .",
    "13 of olling ( 1996a ) , the scale height of increases from @xmath70 pc at a radius of 5 kpc to 1.5 kpc at 13 kpc . however , the factors which determine the scale height of a _ stellar _ disk are more complex : although stars are born out of ism with low velocity dispersion which is constant with radius ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , various heating mechanisms change the velocity dispersion and , thus , the scale height .",
    "the velocity dispersion of stars in the solar neighborhood increases with age ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is thought to be due to heating by spiral arms and giant molecular clouds , with gmcs being particularly important for vertical heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "van der kruit & searle found that the scale height of the stellar disks in the galaxies they studied ( 1981a , b , 1982a , b ) remained constant with radius , despite the variation in co surface density and , so presumably , numbers of gmcs with radius .",
    "recently , @xcite claim evidence for disk flaring in their study of 48 edge - on galaxies , and for a trend of increasing flaring with hubble type ( in the sense that earlier types show more flaring ) . for s0 galaxies ( de  vaucouleurs type @xmath712 )",
    ", they predict a change in scale height with radius of @xmath72 . for sc galaxies ( de  vaucouleurs type @xmath39 5 ) , they predict a change in scale height with radius of @xmath73 , which is consistent with our result of a statistically insignificant variation between the inner and outer parts of the disk for ngc  4244 . it is hard to understand this variation with hubble type if the flaring is caused by the factors discussed above .",
    "de  grijs & peltier fit only regions between 1.5 and 4.0 scale lengths , so the gravitational effect of the bulge can be ignored in their study .    for earlier type galaxies , however",
    ", the determination of disk flaring is more difficult : as noted by @xcite , galaxy interactions , warps , and thick disks can also cause an apparent change in scale height .",
    "an incorrect bulge - disk decomposition will have the same effect .",
    "to distinguish flaring from the presence of a thick disk requires fainter surface photometry than a survey project like de  grijs & peltier s can achieve .",
    "viewed from outside , the milky way s thick disk would be visible at @xmath74  =  23 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 ( @xcite , assuming @xmath75  =  0.5 ) , which is the surface brightness level at which de  grijs & peltier s single disk vertical profiles ( their figure 3 ) begin to deviate from a single exponential fit .    as discussed in section [ oned ] , the adopted inclination , which can be an indication of a warp , can have a large effect on apparent flaring .",
    "kinematic inclination determinations , such as olling s for ngc  4244 , do not exist for many galaxies , making the detection of some warps and correct modeling of the disks more difficult .",
    "de  grijs & peltier do not address the presence of warps in the galaxies they observed .    in conclusion ,",
    "the question of how the thickness of stellar disks vary with radius is a thorny one to approach observationally , especially in early type galaxies where the existence of additional components like bulges and thick disks makes accurate separation of the thin disk light very difficult ( see morrison et al .",
    "1997 for a discussion of how the problem is exacerbated if one - dimensional profiles are used instead of two - dimensional fits ) .",
    "our data show a statistically insignificant increase in scale height between the inner and outer parts of the disk of ngc  4244 , and it is possible that this is partially due to the small warp .",
    "this highlights the need for more theoretical work on disk heating mechanisms .",
    "a single exponential disk ( equation [ rho ] ) is a good fit to the data down to 27.5 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 ( see figure [ profiles ] ) .",
    "we do not see evidence of an extra component .",
    "however , our data may not rule out a faint component resembling the milky way s halo , which has a very centrally concentrated space distribution , with density @xmath76 varying as @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "ngc  4244 has a nucleus with total luminosity 2% of its disk s , which we calculate using the disk central surface brightness and bulge effective intensity given in baggett et al .",
    "1998 , and a bulge effective radius of 4(71  pc ) .",
    "what if this nucleus was the central part of such a halo ?",
    "we assume that the core radius of this putative halo is two pixels ( 71  pc ) , and calculate what brightness a power - law halo which fit smoothly onto the luminosity distribution of the nucleus would be .",
    "on the minor axis , 2  kpc above the plane , the @xmath77 halo would have a brightness @xmath11 = 26.5 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 , which our data rule out , but the @xmath78 halo would have a brightness @xmath11 = 28.4 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 , below our detection limit .",
    "it is interesting to compare ngc  4244 with its local group analog , m  33 , which has a bulge - to - disk ratio of @xmath210.02 ( @xcite ) .",
    "while it is difficult to search for halo field stars in m  33 because of its nearly face - on inclination and badly warped disk , there is evidence for a small number of globular clusters with halo kinematics .",
    "@xcite show that m  33 has @xmath2120 old clusters in a kinematically hot configuration ( see also @xcite ) . whether these clusters are better associated with m  33 s disk or tiny bulge",
    ", their kinematics suggest that any field stars associated with them would have a larger scale height than the thin disk .",
    "there have been no searches for globular clusters in ngc  4244 , but we see no evidence for an extended field star population in this galaxy .",
    "a globular cluster search in ngc  4244 would help us decide whether it truly has no halo .",
    "ngc  5907 , a more luminous sc , has a second component , which does not resemble either the milky way s halo or thick disk ( @xcite , morrison et al .",
    "we have obtained deep @xmath0 band surface photometry of the small , edge - on scd galaxy ngc  4244 .    1 .",
    "we find that ngc  4244 is well - described by a single exponential disk with a scale height of 246 @xmath3 2 pc , a scale length of 1.84 @xmath3 0.02 kpc , and a radial cut - off at 5.4 disk scale lengths .",
    "the thin disk parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 for ngc  4244 are smaller than those of ngc  5907 by about 50% ( cf .",
    "morrison et al . 1994 ) .",
    "2 .   ngc  4244 is a good galaxy for investigating stellar disk flaring because it does not have a significant thick disk and because it has no large companions .",
    "we find , in agreement with @xcite , statistically insignificant flaring in the stellar disk .",
    "the warp in ngc  4244 may exaggerate the marginal disk flaring that we see .",
    "we have placed stronger limits on the existence of a cutoff in the stellar disk .",
    "4 .   unlike the more luminous sc galaxies m  33 and ngc  5907 , ngc  4244 does not show a significant second component .",
    "it is necessary to have accurate error estimates for both the 1-d and 2-d fitting . unlike earlier photographic work",
    ", deep ccd surface photometry allows us to quantify measurement errors .",
    "measurement errors arise from ccd behavior such as readout noise and flat - fielding , as well as from intrinsic galaxy variations .",
    "each error contribution will be addressed below .",
    "the readout noise per exposure is 1.2 adu . by combining 66 galaxy images with a median",
    ", we are able to reduce the effective readnoise to @xmath79 averaging the 66 frames would have reduced @xmath80 to 0.15 adu ; however , combining with a median is preferable for the removal of cosmic rays and other data defects .",
    "the factor of 1.22 is because of the reduced efficiency of a median ( see morrison , boroson & harding 1994 ) .      for @xmath81 adu in a given pixel ,",
    "the photon noise is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the gain . combining 66 galaxy images using a median reduces the photon noise to @xmath84 in the final combined galaxy image , the contribution to the error from photon noise is 0.137  @xmath85  adu .      in principle , the only limit to the precision of the combined flat field image is the photon noise in the individual flat field images .",
    "this small - scale variation is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of counts in the final , combined master sky flat image , @xmath83 is the gain , @xmath88 is the number of individual sky flats used to make the master sky flat , and @xmath89 is the number of individual galaxy images used to make the final galaxy image .",
    "the sky counts @xmath87 = 1998.0 adu , the gain is 1.2 adu , and the numbers of sky and galaxy images are 70 and 66 , respectively .    in practice , the small - scale flat fielding errors are not the only flat - fielding error we have .",
    "there are also large - scale variations which arise from the variation of the sky brightness across an image and from the wings of bright stars which have not been completely removed by combining the individual sky flats . to estimate the large scale variations @xmath90 , we divided our sky flats into two subsets of 12 each and constructed two mini - master sky flats .",
    "we then used iraf s blkavg to bin the mini - masters into 100x100 pixel bins , to remove small - scale variations , and divided one mini - master into the other .",
    "the standard deviation of the divided images was 0.085% @xmath87 .",
    "the large - scale variation @xmath90 is reduced by @xmath91 because the mini - masters were constructed from half as many sky images as the master and by another 1/2 because of the division of the two mini - masters .",
    "the large scale flat - fielding variation @xmath90 = 0.03% @xmath87 .",
    "another source of error arises from intrinsic variations in the galaxy .",
    "the light in each pixel comes from individual stars , and , thus , is subject to counting statistics .",
    "the variance of the brightness fluctuations is characterized by @xcite .",
    "following their equation 10 and @xcite , we used @xmath92 , @xmath93 mpc , @xmath94 ( for the @xmath0 band ) , and @xmath95 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the variance of the brightness is 3.61@xmath96 , where @xmath96 is the number of counts from the galaxy only .",
    "seeing has the effect of lessening the apparent brightness fluctuations .",
    "we modeled the effect of seeing empirically , by creating an iraf image with known @xmath97 and smoothing the image by a gaussian of similar fwhm as our typical seeing .",
    "the smoothed image was binned in bins of 3x3 to 50x50 pixels and @xmath29 recalculated for each bin size . without the effect of seeing , @xmath97 would be reduced by a factor of @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the bin size .",
    "we calculated the residuals @xmath100 for each bin size .",
    "a function was fit to the @xmath101 residuals and this function was used to correct the surface brightness variation errors for seeing .",
    "our error in determining the sky level was 0.8 adu , or @xmath0 = 29.3 magnitude arcsec@xmath1 , obtained from the histogram shown in figure [ histsky ] .",
