    "gauge theories form the backbone of the standard model .",
    "the weak - coupling perturbative expansion of gauge theory scattering amplitudes , carried out by means of feynman diagrams , has led to theoretical predictions in remarkable agreement with high - energy collider data  @xcite .",
    "this high - precision agreement places strong bounds on new physics . in the strong - interaction sector of the standard model",
    " described by quantum chromodynamics  the precision is not as great as in the electroweak sector .",
    "qcd is asymptotically free , so the strong coupling constant @xmath0 becomes weak at large momentum transfers , justifying a perturbative expansion  @xcite .",
    "physical quantities do depend on nonperturbative , long - distance qcd , in the form of quantities such as parton distribution and fragmentation functions , as well as on the physics of hadronization .",
    "in many processes at modern colliders , however , the dominant theoretical uncertainties are due to an incomplete knowledge of the perturbation series , rather than to our relative ignorance of nonperturbative aspects of scattering processes .",
    "the situation is exacerbated by the slow approach to asymptopia ( @xmath0 is of order @xmath1 at the 100  gev scale ) , and by the presence of large logarithms of ratios of scales .",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) term in the @xmath0 expansion of a qcd cross - section comes simply from squaring a tree - level scattering amplitude .",
    "efficient techniques for computing qcd tree amplitudes have been available for some time now  @xcite , and the results have provided a basic theoretical description of qcd processes and thereby estimates of qcd backgrounds to new physics searches",
    ". unfortunately , higher order corrections , especially those enhanced by logarithms , can be sizeable .",
    "the ultraviolet logarithms manifest themselves in the residual renormalization - scale dependence of a finite - order prediction .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath2 is introduced in order to define the coupling constant ; renormalization group invariance requires any physical quantity to be independent of it .",
    "however , when a perturbative expansion is truncated at a finite order , residual @xmath2-dependence appears , because the cancellation takes place across different orders in @xmath0 .",
    "calculations at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath0 significantly reduce the dependence on @xmath2 as compared to leading order . as an example , shows the comparison of the lo and nlo theoretical predictions to the experimental measurement of a point in the single - jet inclusive distribution .",
    "note the good agreement between nlo theory and experiment and the significant reduction of theoretical uncertainties , compared to the lo calculation .",
    "infrared logarithms arise because jet processes involve more than one scale , at the very least a scale characterizing the jet size in addition to the hard scale of the short - distance scattering , and because of the infrared divergences of perturbative qcd .",
    "these divergences transform the perturbation expansion for such quantities from one in @xmath0 alone to one in @xmath3 and @xmath4 in addition to @xmath0 , where @xmath5 is a jet ` resolution ' parameter .",
    "all three must be small for the perturbation expansion to be reliable ; but the first two can not be calculated in an lo calculation . only in an nlo calculation are the corresponding terms determined quantitatively , and only at this order can one establish the reliability of the perturbative calculation .    beyond the logarithmically - enhanced corrections , the @xmath6 corrections to most jet observables are larger than non - perturbative power corrections and corrections due to quark masses , and are thus the most important ones to calculate in order to refine the precision of theoretical predictions .",
    "-.75 cm    despite the need for higher - order qcd computations , at present no quantities have been computed beyond next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , and the only quantities that have been computed fully at nnlo are totally inclusive quantities such as the total cross - section for @xmath7 annihilation into hadrons , and the qcd corrections to various sum rules in deeply inelastic scattering @xcite . at nlo",
    ", there are many complete calculations ( in the form of computer programs producing numerical results ) for a variety of processes , but at present results are still limited to where the basic process has four external legs ( counting electroweak vector bosons rather than their decay products as external legs ) .",

    "nlo corrections to three - jet production at hadron colliders .",
    "these contributions would allow a measurement of @xmath0 ( via the three - jet to two - jet ratio ) at the highest experimentally available momentum transfers , as well as next - to - leading - order studies of jet structure .",

    "nlo corrections to @xmath10 jets . at the @xmath11 resonance , this is the lowest - order process in which the quark and gluon color charges can be measured independently .",
    "it will also be useful for ruling out the presence of light colored fermions ( or scalars ) .",
    "at lep2 it is a background to threshold production of @xmath8 pairs , when both @xmath8 s decay hadronically .",
    "nnlo corrections to @xmath12 jets .",
    "these corrections are the dominant uncertainty in a precision extraction of @xmath0 from hadronic event shapes at the @xmath11 @xcite",
    ".    in any of these processes , deviations of experimental results from the theoretical predictions could indicate new physics .",
    "why do these higher - order qcd corrections remain uncalculated ?",
    "nlo corrections can be divided into real and virtual parts .",
    "real corrections arise from the emission of one additional parton into the final state , and are straightforward to compute from tree amplitudes with one more leg than the lo tree amplitude .",
    "virtual corrections arise from the interference of the lo tree amplitude with a one - loop amplitude .",
    "each contribution is infrared divergent , but the divergences cancel in the sum , after integrating the real contribution over `` unobserved '' partons in the final state @xcite , and factorizing initial state singularities into the definition of parton distributions in an incoming hadron @xcite .",
    "the remaining finite integrations are typically performed with a numerical program @xcite .    while the numerical evaluation of nlo corrections can be non - trivial ,",
    "the major analytical bottleneck is simply the availability of one - loop amplitudes , which enter into the virtual corrections . in particular ,",
    "one - loop amplitudes with more than four external legs ( and all quarks massless ) , which are required for the higher - order corrections listed above , have only recently become available , thanks to the development of new calculational techniques .",
    "the purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to some of these techniques , together with worked - out examples .",
    "-.9 cm    our emphasis will be on obtaining compact analytic results .",
    "in general , it is preferable to have such results for matrix elements , even though they are ultimately inserted into numerical programs for computing cross - sections . without compact results ,",
    "numerical instabilities can arise from the vanishing of spurious denominators in the expression . with analytic forms",
    "it is also easier to compare independent calculations , to understand better how to organize calculations , and even to obtain results for an arbitrary number of external legs @xcite .",
    "gauge theories have an elegant construction based on the principle of local gauge invariance .",
    "the qcd lagrangian for massless quarks @xmath13 is @xmath14 where the covariant derivative @xmath15 and field strength @xmath16/g$ ] are given in terms of the matrix - valued gauge connection @xmath17 . of the fundamental - representation generators @xmath18 accounts for the @xmath19 s here ; it serves to eliminate the @xmath19 s from the partial amplitudes defined below .",
    "] since @xmath20 depends on a single coupling constant @xmath21 , all the interactions are dictated by gauge symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , the feynman diagram expansion does not respect this invariance , because the quantization procedure fixes the gauge symmetry .",
    "individual diagrams are not gauge invariant , and are often more complicated than the final sum over diagrams .",
    "the non - abelian gluon self - interactions coming from the cubic and quartic terms in have a complicated index structure and momentum - dependence .",
    "so while it is straightforward in principle to compute both tree and loop amplitudes by drawing all feynman diagrams and evaluating them , in practice this method becomes extremely inefficient and cumbersome as the number of external legs grows . for five or more external legs",
    "there are a large number of kinematic variables , which allow the construction of complicated expressions . indeed",
    ", intermediate expressions tend to be vastly more complicated than the final results , when the latter are represented in an appropriate way .",
    "-.7 cm    as an example consider the five - gluon pentagon diagram , depicted in , which would be encountered in a brute - force computation of nlo corrections to three - jet production at a hadron collider .",
    "each of the five non - abelian three - point vertices in the diagram is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the @xmath24 structure constants , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath13 the momenta , and @xmath27 the minkowski metric . as the non - abelian vertex has six terms ,",
    "a rough estimate of the number of terms is about @xmath28 .",
    "each term is associated with a loop integral which evaluates to an expression on the order of a page in length .",
    "this means that one is faced with about @xmath29 pages of algebra for this single diagram . as bad as this brute - force approach",
    "might seem , the situation is actually worse , because of the structure of the results . after evaluating the integrals and summing over a few hundred more diagrams one obtains expressions of the form @xmath30 , where the factors @xmath31 are polynomials in the gluon polarization vectors and external momenta , and the @xmath32 ( polynomials in the external invariants )",
    "are produced when the loop integrals are reduced to a standard set of functions .",
    "in general the @xmath32 contain spurious kinematic singularities which cancel only after combining many terms over a common denominator ; this causes an explosion of terms in the numerator .",
    "in contrast to the complexity of intermediate expressions , the final results can be strikingly simple .",
    "for example , the five gluon amplitudes which we shall describe in section  [ susydecompositionsubsection ] are remarkably compact .",
    "substantial progress has been made in the past decade in improving the calculation of tree - level amplitudes .",
    "four ideas which have played an important role are the spinor helicity method for gluon polarization vectors @xcite , the color decomposition @xcite , supersymmetry identities @xcite , and the berends and giele recurrence relations @xcite .",
    "although these ideas form a basis for the one - loop techniques described here , they have been extensively reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we permit ourselves only a brief review below .",
    "as illustrated by the pentagon example above , one - loop computations are significantly more complicated than tree computations , so further techniques are useful for preventing an explosion in algebra .",
    "the additional ideas which we shall discuss in this review involve string theory , supersymmetry , unitarity , and factorization .",
    "string theory , for example , suggests better gauge choices , a supersymmetric decomposition of amplitudes , and an improved disentanglement of color and kinematics .",
    "approaches based on unitarity and factorization make use of the analytic properties of amplitudes to build further amplitudes using known ones . since these approaches use gauge - invariant quantities as the basic building blocks of new amplitudes they tend to be extremely efficient .",
    "although we shall not discuss recursion relations here , mahlon has made considerable progress in applying these to one - loop amplitudes  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we demonstrate the methods for amplitudes where all external particles are gluons , even though most of the techniques ( or analogs of them ) can be applied to amplitudes with external fermions as well .    to date",
    ", these techniques have allowed for the computation of all one - loop five - parton helicity amplitudes @xcite , as well several infinite sequences of one - loop amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the five - parton amplitudes are currently being incorporated into numerical programs for nlo three - jet production at hadron colliders , the first item on the list in section 1.1 @xcite .",
    "thus the analytical bottleneck to nlo corrections is yielding to the new techniques described in this review .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the use of color and helicity information to decompose amplitudes into ` primitive amplitudes ' .",
    "these building blocks have a much simpler analytic structure than the full amplitudes , a fact which will be exploited in subsequent sections .",
    "we also review the application of supersymmetric ward identities to qcd .",
    "color decompositions have a long history , dating back to chan - paton factors in early formulations of string theory @xcite .",
    "they are also related to the `` double - line '' formalism introduced by ",
    "t hooft in the large-@xmath33 ( number of colors ) approach to qcd  @xcite , although here we will not make any large-@xmath33 or `` leading - color '' approximations .",
    "the basic idea is to use group theory to break up an amplitude into gauge - invariant pieces which are composed of feynman diagrams with a fixed cyclic ordering of external legs .",
    "these pieces are simpler because poles and cuts can only appear in kinematic invariants made out of cyclicly adjacent sums of momenta , of the form @xmath34 . at the four - point level",
    "this is not so important , because only one of the three mandelstam variables @xmath35,@xmath9,@xmath36 is thereby excluded ; but as the number of external legs grows , the total number of invariants grows much faster than the number of cyclicly adjacent ones .",
    "the following brief review focuses on results needed later , rather than derivations .",
    "a more complete discussion can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first generalize the gauge group of qcd to @xmath37 , with the quarks transforming in the fundamental representation . the simplest way to implement the color decomposition in field theory",
    "is by rewriting the group structure constants appearing in feynman diagrams in terms of fundamental representation matrices @xmath38 after making this substitution in a generic feynman diagram we obtain a large number of traces , many sharing @xmath18 s with contracted indices , of the form @xmath39 .",
    "if external quarks are present , then in addition to the traces there will be some strings of @xmath18 s terminated by fundamental indices . to reduce the number of traces and strings to a minimum",
    ", we rearrange the contracted @xmath18 s , using @xmath40 where the sum over @xmath41 is implicit .",
    "( if all lines are in the adjoint representation the second term drops out by a @xmath42 decoupling identity @xcite , which follows from the lack of a ` photon ' self - coupling . )",
    "a _ partial amplitude _ is the coefficient of a given color trace in the resulting color decomposition of the amplitude .",
    "for example , in the @xmath43-gluon tree amplitude , application of reduces all color factors to single traces .",
    "thus its decomposition is @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the partial amplitudes , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the color index of the @xmath48-th external gluon , and @xmath49 is the set of non - cyclic permutations of @xmath50 , corresponding to the set of inequivalent traces .",
    "the labels on the gluon momenta @xmath51 and polarization vectors @xmath52 , implicit in , are also to be permuted by @xmath53 . in the next subsection",
    "we will go over to a helicity basis , and the label @xmath48 will be replaced by @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the ( outgoing ) gluon helicity .",
    "similarly , tree amplitudes with a pair of external quarks can be reduced to a sum over single strings of matrices , @xmath56 , and so on . for a proof that individual partial amplitudes are gauge invariant , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    at one loop ,",
    "additional color structures are possible ; in the @xmath43-gluon amplitude double traces appear as well as single traces .",
    "for example , the color decomposition of the one - loop five - gluon amplitude is @xmath57 ; \\cr } \\equn\\label{loopcolor}\\ ] ] as in   the permutation sums are over all inequivalent traces . for gauge group @xmath58 , the partial amplitudes @xmath59 multiplying traces of the form @xmath60 would also have to be included , but for @xmath37 the trace of a single generator vanishes .",
    "the decomposition of the @xmath43-gluon amplitude into single - trace ( @xmath61 ) and double - trace ( @xmath62 ) components is entirely analogous .",
    "were one to consider the large-@xmath33 limit , the single - trace terms would give rise to the leading contributions , and we will refer to the corresponding partial amplitudes as leading - color partial amplitudes ; the double - trace terms have subleading - color partial amplitudes as coefficients .    the rules for constructing leading - color partial amplitudes such as @xmath45 and @xmath61 are _ color - ordered _ feynman rules , which are depicted in for the standard lorentz - feynman gauge .",
    "these rules are obtained from ordinary feynman rules by restricting attention to a given ordering of color matrices . applying to and extracting the coefficient of @xmath63",
    "gives the color - ordered three - vertex in ; and similarly for the color - ordered four - vertex , the coefficient of @xmath64 .",
    "the only diagrams to be computed are those that can be drawn in a planar fashion with the external legs following the ordering of the color trace under consideration .",
    "-.7 cm    the immediate advantage of rewriting feynman rules in this way is that fewer diagrams contribute to a given partial amplitude , and its analytic structure is simpler . as a simple example , with conventional feynman diagrams one would have a total of four conventional feynman diagrams , depicted in for the four - point tree amplitude . with color - ordered feynman rules one would compute the partial amplitude @xmath65 associated with the color trace @xmath66 ,",
    "omitting diagram  [ fourpointtreefigure]c since the ordering of the legs do not follow the ordering of the color trace .",
    "thus @xmath65 has no pole in @xmath67 .",
    "the other partial amplitudes can be obtained by permuting the arguments of @xmath65 .",
    "for the five - gluon amplitude , there are 10 color - ordered diagrams as opposed to 40 total .",
    "obviously the simplifications obtained using partial amplitudes increase rapidly with the number of external legs .",
    "-.7 cm    at one loop , one also has to compute subleading - color partial amplitudes , such as the double - trace coefficients @xmath68 in , which can not be obtained directly from color - ordered rules .",
    "fortunately there exist general formulas relating such quantities to permutation sums of color - ordered objects @xcite .",
    "for example , the gluon - loop contribution to the four - gluon amplitude can be found from the relation @xmath69 such formul  can be derived from string theory @xcite , although the most straightforward way to prove them is using color flow diagrams in field theory @xcite . to understand formula ( [ fourpointperms ] )",
    "heuristically , it is useful to focus on the box diagram . using ordinary feynman rules and expanding out the structure constants using eqs .",
    "( [ fundconvert ] ) and ( [ colorfierz ] ) it is straightforward to check that the box diagrams contribute to @xmath70 and @xmath71 in such a way that   is satisfied . roughly speaking , gauge invariance then requires the remaining diagrams to tag along properly with the box diagram .",
    "thus we can restrict our discussion henceforth to amplitudes with a fixed ordering of external legs , which we call _ primitive amplitudes_. in the @xmath43-gluon cases discussed above , the set of primitive amplitudes coincides with the leading - color partial amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath61 , but this is not always the case . for example , one - loop amplitudes with external fermions have leading - color ( as well as subleading - color ) partial amplitudes that are sums of several primitive amplitudes @xcite .      in explicit calculations ,",
    "it is very convenient to adopt a helicity ( circular polarization ) basis for external gluons .",
    "the spinor helicity formalism  @xcite expresses the positive- and negative - helicity polarization vectors in terms of massless weyl spinors @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary null ` reference ' momentum which drops out of the final gauge - invariant amplitudes .",

    "as we shall discuss in section [ factorizationsection ] , in the collinear limit where @xmath51 and @xmath76 become parallel , helicity amplitudes have a square - root singular behavior , @xmath77 , whose magnitude and phase are captured concisely by the spinor products .",
    "this helps explain why spinor products provide an extremely compact representation of amplitudes .    in performing calculations ,",
    "the schouten identity is useful , @xmath78 a more complete discussion , including further identities and numerical representations of the spinor products , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . to maximize the benefit of the spinor helicity formalism for loop amplitudes",
    "we must choose a compatible regularization scheme .",
    "in conventional dimensional regularization @xcite , the polarization vectors are @xmath79-dimensional ; this is incompatible with the spinor helicity method , which assumes four - dimensional polarizations . to avoid this problem",
    ", we modify the regularization scheme so all helicity states are four - dimensional and only the loop momentum is continued to @xmath79 dimensions .",
    "this is the four - dimensional - helicity ( fdh ) scheme @xcite , which has been shown to be equivalent @xcite to an appropriate helicity formulation of siegel s dimensional - reduction scheme @xcite at one - loop .",
    "the conversion between schemes has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , so there is no loss of generality in choosing the fdh scheme .      the reader might worry that the color and helicity decompositions will lead to a huge proliferation in the number of primitive or partial amplitudes that have to be computed .",
    "in fact , this does not happen , thanks to the group theory relations mentioned above , plus the discrete symmetries of parity and charge conjugation .",
    "parity simultaneously reverses all helicities in an amplitude ; shows that it is implemented by the exchange @xmath80 .",
    "charge conjugation is related to the antisymmetry of the color - ordered rules ; for pure - glue partial amplitudes it takes the form of a reflection identity , @xmath81 for amplitudes with external quarks , it allows one to exchange a quark and anti - quark , or equivalently to flip the helicity on a quark line .    as an example , with the use of parity and cyclic ( @xmath82 ) symmetry , we can reduce the five - gluon amplitude at tree level to a combination of just four independent partial amplitudes : @xmath83 furthermore , the first two partial amplitudes here vanish ( see below ) , and there is a group theory ( @xmath42 decoupling ) relation between the last two @xcite , so there is only one independent nonvanishing object to calculate . at one loop",
    "there are four independent objects  with @xmath84 replaced by @xmath85  but only the last two contribute to the nlo cross - section , due to the tree - level vanishings .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath86 is given in section  [ susydecompositionsubsection ] .",
    "what does supersymmetry have to do with a non - supersymmetric theory such as qcd ?",
    "the answer is that tree - level qcd is `` effectively '' supersymmetric  @xcite .",
    "consider an @xmath43-gluon tree amplitude .",
    "it has no loops in it , so it has no fermion loops in it .",
    "the fermions in the theory might as well be in the adjoint representation , that is , the theory might as well be a super yang - mills theory .",
    "pure - gluon tree amplitudes in qcd are indeed identical to those in the supersymmetric theory , and are thus related by supersymmetry to amplitudes with fermions ( the gluinos ) .",
    "it is however more useful to think of such relations as connecting _",
    "partial _ amplitudes .",
    "these relations are the so - called supersymmetric ward identities ( swi )  @xcite .",
    "they connect pure - gluon partial amplitudes to partial amplitudes with a quark pair , because after the color information has been stripped off , the latter are identical to partial amplitudes with gluinos instead of quarks .",
    "using the swi saves computational labor  @xcite .",
    "the swi relate amplitudes with all external gluons , @xmath21 , to amplitudes where a pair of gluons is replaced by a pair of gluinos , @xmath87 , or a pair of complex scalars , @xmath88 .",
    "specifically , the swi that we shall make use of in later sections are @xmath89 where ` @xmath90 ' denotes positive - helicity gluons , and the helicity assignments on @xmath88 refer to particle or antiparticle assignments rather than genuine helicity . at tree level , these identities hold for all qcd partial amplitudes ; for supersymmetric partial amplitudes , they hold to all orders in perturbation theory .    at one loop",
    "qcd `` knows '' that it is not supersymmetric , but one can still perform a supersymmetric decomposition of a qcd amplitude ( see section  [ susydecompositionsubsection ] ) , for which the supersymmetric components of the amplitude will obey  .",
    "one may also use the identities to find relations amongst non - supersymmetric contributions .",
    "for example , in @xmath91 super - yang - mills , one can use the first of the identities in to deduce that fermion- and gluon - loop contributions are equal and opposite for @xmath43-gluon amplitudes with maximal helicity violation . by considering an @xmath92 theory , with one gluon , two gluinos and one ( complex ) scalar , one deduces that all three types of loop contribution must be proportional to each other .",
    "we therefore obtain , for @xmath37 qcd with @xmath93 massless complex scalars and @xmath94 massless dirac fermions , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the contribution of a single scalar and the factors of @xmath97 are the conversion factors between the adjoint and fundamental representation loops .",
    "( note that adjoint representation complex scalars have two states , but we have chosen the normalization that scalars in the fundamental representation  @xmath98  have four states , the same as for their would - be superpartner fermions . )",
    "string theory has provided a number of improvements in the calculation of one - loop amplitudes . originally , we used it to derive a set of diagrammatic computational rules for calculating gluon amplitudes @xcite .",
    "such rules were used in the first computation of the one - loop five - gluon amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the same methods also work well for gravity calculations @xcite .",
    "one of the authors has reviewed the string - based rules in ref .",
    "@xcite and we shall not do so here .",
    "other approaches to the string - based rules have been formulated @xcite . in particular , the first - quantized particle world - line has led to a rather efficient computation of the two - loop qed @xmath99-function @xcite and of coefficients of high - dimension operators in effective actions .",
    "the basic motivation for the use of string theory follows from the compact representation it provides for amplitudes : at each loop order there is only a single closed string diagram .",
    "as depicted in , the string theory diagram contains within it all the feynman diagrams , including contributions of the entire tower of superheavy string excitations .",
    "the unwanted superheavy contributions are removed by taking the `` low - energy limit '' where all external momentum invariants are much less than the string tension .",
    "this limit picks out different regions of integration in the string diagram ( see ) , corresponding roughly to particle - like diagrams , but with different , string - based , rules  @xcite .",
    "-.7 cm    given knowledge of the string - based rules and organization , one may also formulate a conventional field - theory framework which mimics them @xcite ( at least for one - loop multiparton amplitudes ) , but which can be applied more broadly ( for example , to amplitudes with external fermions ) . at one loop ,",
    "key ingredients of this string - inspired framework are : use of a special gauge which is a hybrid of gervais - neveu gauge  @xcite and background - field gauge  @xcite ; improved color decompositions ; systematic organization of the algebra ; and a second - order formalism for fermions @xcite which helps make supersymmetry relations manifest .",
    "gervais - neveu gauge , originally derived from the low - energy limit of tree - level string amplitudes  @xcite , has the following gauge - fixed action ( ignoring ghosts ) : @xmath100 - { 1\\over 2 } \\tr[(\\partial \\cdot a   - i g a^2/\\sqrt{2})^2 ] \\bigr ) .",

    "-.7 cm    given this understanding of the string reorganization of tree amplitudes , one might guess that string theory would best be described by the gervais - neveu gauge at one loop as well . however , the gauge most closely resembling the string organization of one - loop amplitudes is a hybrid gauge involving both background - field and gervais - neveu gauges  @xcite . to quantize in a background - field gauge  @xcite one splits the gauge field into a classical background field and a fluctuating quantum field , @xmath101 , and imposes the gauge condition @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the background - field covariant derivative , with @xmath104 evaluated in the adjoint representation .",

    "therefore we may use _ any _ single gauge to compute the trees which are to be sewn onto the 1pi parts of the diagrams .",
    "indeed , the string - motivated recipe is to use background - field gauge only for the 1pi or loop vertices , and gervais - neveu gauge for the remaining tree vertices  @xcite .",

    ", this can be an extremely efficient way to obtain amplitudes since one avoids evaluating loop integrals .",
    "mangano and parke have reviewed the factorization properties of tree - level qcd amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on the corresponding properties at one loop , which are a bit more complicated since the amplitudes generally contain infrared divergent pieces which do not factorize naively .",
    "nevertheless , as any kinematic variable vanishes , one - loop amplitudes have a universal behavior quite similar to that of tree - level amplitudes .",
    "first we review briefly the situation at tree level .",
    "color - ordered amplitudes can have poles only in channels corresponding to the sum of _ cyclicly adjacent _ momenta , that is as @xmath238 , where @xmath239 .",
    "this is because singularities arise from propagators going on - shell , and propagators for color - ordered graphs always carry momenta of the form @xmath240 .",
    "the general form of an @xmath43-point color - ordered tree amplitude in the limit that @xmath241 vanishes is @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the intermediate momentum , @xmath244 and @xmath245 are lower - point scattering amplitudes , and @xmath236 denotes the helicity of the intermediate state @xmath163 .",
    "the intermediate helicity is reversed going from one product amplitude to the other because of the outgoing - particle helicity convention .    for two - particle channels ( @xmath162 ) , needs to be modified , because a three - point massless scattering amplitude is not kinematically possible . as @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 become collinear .",
    "qcd amplitudes have an angular - momentum obstruction in this limit .",
    "for example , a gluon of helicity @xmath249 can not split into two collinear helicity @xmath250 gluons and conserve angular momentum .",
    "this transforms the full pole in @xmath251 into the square - root of a pole , @xmath252 , a behavior which is well captured via the spinor products @xmath253 . it is useful to lump all terms not associated with @xmath254 in   into a ` splitting amplitude ' @xmath255 . in particular , as the momenta of adjacent legs @xmath41 and @xmath256 become collinear , we have @xmath257 where @xmath163 is the intermediate state with momentum @xmath258 , @xmath236 denotes the helicity of @xmath163 , and @xmath259 is the longitudinal momentum fraction , @xmath260 , @xmath261 .",
    "the universality of these limits can be derived diagrammatically , but an elegant way to derive it is from string theory @xcite , because all the field theory diagrams on each side of the pole are lumped into one string diagram .",
    "given the general form ( [ treesplit ] ) , one may obtain explicit expressions for the tree - level @xmath262 splitting amplitudes from the four- and five - gluon amplitudes @xcite .",
    "for example , taking the collinear limits of   for @xmath263 and comparing to  eqs .",
    "( [ ggggmmpptree ] ) and  ( [ treesplit ] ) shows that @xmath264 the remaining helicity configurations are obtained using parity .",
    "the @xmath265 and @xmath266 splitting amplitudes can be obtained in similar fashion .",
    "the situation for color - ordered one - loop amplitudes is similar to tree level .",

    "the factorization functions are nonetheless universal functions depending on the infrared divergences present in the amplitudes @xcite .    -.7 cm    the collinear limits for color - ordered one - loop amplitudes are a special case and have the form @xmath270 which is schematically depicted in . the splitting amplitudes @xmath271 and @xmath272",
    "are universal : they depend only on the two momenta becoming collinear , and not upon the specific amplitude under consideration .",
    "the explicit @xmath272 were originally determined from the four- and five - point one - loop amplitudes @xcite in much the same way as we obtained the tree - level splitting amplitudes above .",
    "( see appendix  b of ref .",
    "@xcite . ) soft limits  the behavior as any particular @xmath273  are also useful for constraining the form of one - loop amplitudes , and have a form analogous to .",
    "-.7 cm    in performing explicit calculations , factorization provides an extremely stringent check since one must obtain the correct limits in all channels . a sign or labeling error , for example ,",
    "will invariably be detected in some limits . in some cases",
    "one can also use factorization to construct anstze for higher - point amplitudes @xcite .",
    "one writes down a sufficiently general form for a higher - point amplitude , containing arbitrary coefficients which are then fixed by imposing the correct behavior as kinematic variables vanish . a collinear bootstrap of this form would , however , miss functions that are nonsingular in all collinear limits . for five - point amplitudes",
    "it is possible to write down such a function , namely @xmath274 since the contracted antisymmetric tensor @xmath275 vanishes when any two of the five vectors @xmath51 become collinear ( using @xmath276 ) .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the factorization constraint uniquely specifies the rational functions of color - ordered @xmath277-point amplitudes , given the lower point amplitudes .",
    "a heuristic explanation of this conjecture is that as the number of external legs increases , by dimensional analysis the amplitudes require ever increasing powers of momenta in the denominators .",
    "thus one expects more kinematic poles from the denominator than zeros from the numerator .",
    "we know of no counter - examples to this conjecture , but do nt have a proof either .      as an example of the behavior of a one - loop amplitude in a collinear limit ,",
    "consider the @xmath111 five - gluon amplitude @xmath278 given in  .",
    "taking the limit @xmath279 , and using the four - gluon result  ( [ ggggmmppneqfour ] ) , we find @xmath280 where the tree splitting amplitude is given in .",

    "\\cr } \\equn\\ ] ] note that the loop splitting amplitude has absorbed the mismatch of infrared divergences between the five- and four - point amplitudes .",
    "this splitting amplitude will reappear in different collinear limits of this and other amplitudes .",
    "given the splitting amplitudes and five - point amplitudes , it is also possible to construct conjectures for higher - point amplitudes by demanding that they factorize correctly .",
    "consider , for example , the complex - scalar loop contribution to a five - gluon amplitude with all identical helicities @xcite , @xmath282 as noted in section  [ susydecompositionsubsection ] , for this helicity configuration the gluon and fermion loops are proportional to the scalar - loop contribution .",
    "one can verify that this amplitude has the correct collinear limits ( [ loopsplit ] ) , using the four - gluon amplitude ( [ fourplusresult ] ) .",
    "using , the explicit form of the tree splitting amplitudes ( [ treesplittingfunctions ] ) , @xmath283 , and experimenting at small @xmath43 , we can construct higher - point amplitudes by writing down general forms with only two - particle poles , and requiring that they have the correct collinear limits .",
    "doing so leads to the all-@xmath43 ansatz @xcite , @xmath284 \\over \\spa1.2 \\spa2.3 \\cdots \\spa{n}.1 } \\ , , } \\equn\\ ] ] where @xmath285 = { 1\\over 2}\\tr_-[(1-\\gamma_5 ) \\ksl_{i_1 } \\ksl_{i_2 } \\ksl_{i_3 } \\ksl_{i_4}]$ ] .",
    "this result has been confirmed by mahlon via recursive techniques  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the infinite sequence of one - loop @xmath111 supersymmetric mhv amplitudes was first constructed via a collinear bootstrap and only then calculated using the unitarity method described in section  [ susyexamplessubsection ] .",
    "other helicity configurations are more complicated , due to the appearance of multi - particle poles .",
    "nevertheless , one can construct some six - point amplitudes from knowledge of the five - point amplitudes .",
    "this is most useful for the rational - function parts , which can be obtained via unitarity only by working to higher order in  @xmath154 .",
    "we have reviewed various developments in calculational techniques for one - loop gauge theory amplitudes , especially in qcd .",
    "such calculations are necessary in order to confront theoretical predictions with experiments to some degree of precision .",
    "feynman rules , however , become extremely cumbersome for one - loop multi - parton calculations .",
    "even the simplest processes are rather difficult to calculate without aid of a computer and for five or more external legs traditional methods break down because of an exponential explosion in algebra .",
    "the results , however , are usually quite compact , especially when compared to intermediate expressions",
    ".    the computational situation can be greatly improved by combining a number of ideas .",
    "methods that have previously been used at tree - level , such as spinor helicity @xcite , color decomposition @xcite , and supersymmetry ward identities @xcite , remain very useful at one loop .",
    "string theory motivates a number of improved organizational ideas such as supersymmetric decompositions , relations between color - decomposed amplitudes and improved gauge choices @xcite .",
    "these ideas mesh nicely with the use of cutkosky rules @xcite to obtain complete amplitudes . in the superstring organization of the amplitude",
    ", components can be identified whose rational as well as cut - containing parts can be obtained directly from knowledge of the branch cuts @xcite . the remaining components , though more difficult , can be attacked either by evaluating cuts to higher order in @xmath154 or by exploiting universal factorization properties @xcite .    the techniques discussed in this review have made possible a variety of new calculations , including those of all five - parton amplitudes @xcite and of certain infinite sequences of massless amplitudes .",
    "the methods have also been applied to amplitudes containing massive particles @xcite and to gravitational amplitudes @xcite .",
    "mahlon has also used recursion relations , outside of the scope of this review , to obtain infinite sequences of fermion loop amplitudes with maximal helicity violation @xcite .",
