    "many tools of nonlinear time series analysis are based on the theory of ( deterministic ) dynamical systems  @xcite , i.e. , the time evolution of the system under study is considered in some phase space spanned by the relevant dynamical variables . among others ,",
    "the recurrence of previous states in phase space  @xcite is a particular fundamental property of dynamical systems with a finite phase space volume ( e.g. , attractors of a dissipative system , hamiltonian systems with a bound phase space , or even stationary stochastic systems in finite time ) .",
    "the concept of recurrence implies that the dynamics of a system returns to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any of its previously assumed states within a finite ( but possibly large ) amount of time . for deterministic - chaotic systems ,",
    "this is guaranteed by the invariance of the set which forms the support of the attractor  @xcite .",
    "recently , complex network representations have been proposed to characterize statistical properties of the underlying system associated with its geometry in phase space  @xcite . for this purpose , a proper transformation from the set of state vectors in phase space to a complex network representation is required . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the recurrence network ( rn ) approach , the vertices of the network are given by the individual state vectors sampled from a given trajectory , whereas network connectivity is established according to their mutual closeness in phase space ( i.e. , whether or not their mutual distance is smaller than a pre - defined threshold @xmath0 ) .",
    "mathematically , given two state vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote time indices associated with two possibly different points @xmath5 and @xmath6 in time ) , the adjacency matrix @xmath7 of the rn is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the heaviside `` function '' , @xmath0 is the prescribed maximum distance , @xmath10 a norm in phase space ( e.g. , euclidean , manhattan , or maximum norm ) , and @xmath11 is the kronecker delta .",
    "rn analysis originates from the recurrence plot concept  @xcite and its basic assumption is , as the term indicates , the unambiguous presence of recurrence behavior .",
    "stationarity is a condition required by most tools of both linear and nonlinear time series analysis  @xcite , including the rn approach .",
    "a signal is ( strongly ) stationary if all joint probabilities of finding the system at some time in one state and at some later time in another state are independent of time within the observation period .",
    "the minimal requirement for most approaches is weak stationarity , that is , mean and variance of the underlying process are constant and the auto - covariances depend only on the time lag .    in turn , many real - world processes are non - stationary .",
    "for instance , climate or hydrological data often show seasonal variations .",
    "economic and financial time series typically exhibit ( irregular ) cycles of all orders of magnitude .",
    "non - stationary behaviors can be expressed in terms of trends , cycles , random walks , or combinations of the latter three .",
    "often , long - range dependence and self - similarity are involved .",
    "one classical example of a class of such non - stationary processes is fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , which has long - range temporal correlations as its defining property  @xcite .",
    "specifically , for an fbm process @xmath12 , the variance scales as @xmath13 ( i.e. , non - stationarity in variance ) .",
    "the long range of the process is characterized by the hurst exponent @xmath14 when positively correlated ( persistence ) for @xmath15 , while suppressed ( anti - persistence ) for @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 corresponds to the classical brownian motion .",
    "non - stationarity provides a great challenge to both linear and nonlinear time series analysis , including complex network approaches to analyze time series data .",
    "there are some methods that are specifically tailored to cope with non - stationarity . among others ,",
    "detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )  @xcite and related techniques have been widely used for estimating the hurst exponent from non - stationary model data as well as real - world applications from various fields  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , regarding the rn approach , non - stationarity due to time - dependent system parameters can cause a systematic loss of recurrences .",
    "anyway , rns have been recently proposed to characterize fbm  @xcite .",
    "notably , the results of the latter study have been obtained only numerically and not explained theoretically so far . however , as we will demonstrate in the course of this work , they have rather limited physical interpretation .",
    "more generally , we will discuss how spurious results and pitfalls of rn analysis may be produced when this method is inappropriately applied to study fbm or other non - stationary stochastic processes , and that the results of @xcite are mainly of such spurious nature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : fbm ] , we discuss the construction of rns from non - stationary fbm data .",
    "we demonstrate that it is not possible to define generally applicable embedding parameters as required for a systematic investigation of the potential effect of @xmath14 on the rn properties .",
    "specifically , we provide numerical evidence that the latter properties ( for given embedding parameters ) depend explicitly on the system size , which generally does not apply to stationary systems provided that the sample size is large enough and sampling artifacts as well as transient behavior are avoided .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : fgn ] , we turn to the rn properties of the closely related fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) , the incremental process associated with fbm , which is stationary . for the latter , the dependence of the network characteristics on @xmath14 is  in contrast to fbm  well - behaved",
    ". however , the considered embedding dimension still plays an important role when characterizing the rn structures .",
    "all results are summarized and further discussed in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the application of rns to the analysis of nonlinear time series implicitly assumes the validity of two fundamental assumptions : ( i ) the intrinsic model parameters and statistical characteristics of the system remain constant over time and ( ii ) the system under study is sufficiently sampled ( i.e. , time resolution and time series length are sufficient to approximate the system ) .",
    "the first assumption is equivalent to the condition of stationarity , while the second one mainly requires a proper coverage of phase space by a suitably embedded time series .",
    "both requirements are consequences of the fact that we approach the system s dynamics by a single finite time series , which is common to time series analysis problems .",
    "note that there have been attempts to characterize non - stationary systems by means of rn analysis using sliding windows approaches , which have provided interesting results regarding the presence of bifurcation or other qualitative changes in the dynamical regime  @xcite .",
    "however , these considerations have been related to systems with supposed time - varying parameters rather than non - stationary stochastic systems where the parameters are constant .",
    "therefore , this approach might not be helpful in the present context dealing with non - stationary variance .",
    "in the following , we will focus on two important algorithmic parameters of the rn approach , embedding dimension and delay .",
    "the impact of other parameters such as recurrence threshold @xmath0 , sampling rate , or even the selection of variables in multi - dimensional systems has been extensively discussed elsewhere  @xcite for deterministic systems , but not yet for stochastic ones . for the sake of brevity , we present only a brief corresponding discussion here .",
    "specifically , since we consider discrete - time univariate stochastic processes , only @xmath0 is relevant , but can be treated mostly alongside the theoretical considerations presented in  @xcite .    by means of conceptual considerations as well as numerical experiments , in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will address the following three questions : ( i ) can we use embedding techniques for fbm ( or , more generally , non - stationary stochastic processes ) ?",
    "( ii ) what are the intrinsic limitations of this approach ? ( iii ) which implications do these limitations have for rn analysis ?      as the most prominent subject of recent studies involving rn analysis  @xcite , chaotic attractors exhibit some complex geometric structure in their respective phase space , motivating the term `` strange attractors '' .",
    "typically , this structure is associated with self - similar ( fractal ) characteristics .",
    "( notably , there are examples for strange non - chaotic attractors as well  @xcite . )",
    "strange attractors emerge in deterministic dynamical systems , and the resulting asymptotic set of state vectors approached by the system forms some finite object in phase space .",
    "the dynamical properties of the system and the geometric characteristics of the attractor are commonly closely interrelated  @xcite .",
    "taking this idea further , it is a natural approach to describe dynamical systems of whatever kind by a geometric object in some appropriately defined phase space .",
    "this is the basis of rn analysis , which takes the existence of such a phase space ( at least in an abstract sense ) as a fundamental requirement .",
    "given this fact , rn analysis may be applied if the available data series provides enough information to describe ( or approximate ) the geometric structure of the sampled trajectory sufficiently .",
    "specifically , transient dynamics has to be excluded , data length and sampling frequency need to be appropriate , and the data object in phase space needs to be dynamically invariant or at least bound in phase space with stationary properties .    given a scalar time series @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , in order to apply rn analysis we first have to convert the data into state vectors in some appropriately reconstructed phase space . a common method from dynamical systems theory to define such a phase space is time - delay embedding  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the concept of a phase space representation rather than a `` simple '' time or frequency domain approach is the hallmark of many methods of nonlinear time series analysis , requiring embedding as the first step . here , we define @xmath20 to obtain an @xmath21-dimensional time - delay embedding of @xmath22 with embedding delay @xmath23 for obtaining state vectors in phase space  @xcite . it has been proven that for deterministic dynamical systems , the thus reconstructed phase space is topologically equivalent to the original space if @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fractal dimension of the support of the invariant measure generated by the dynamics in the true ( but often at most partially observed ) state space .",
    "note that @xmath25 can be much smaller than the dimension of the underlying original ( physical ) phase space spanned by all relevant system variables .    from a practical perspective , when analyzing a scalar time series of whatever origin , neither embedding dimension @xmath21 nor delay @xmath23",
    "are known a priori .",
    "the false nearest - neighbors ( fnn ) method  @xcite was introduced to derive a reasonable guess of how to choose @xmath21 based on studying whether or not proximity relations between state vectors are lost when the embedding dimension is successively increased .",
    "if a reasonable embedding dimension is found , all dynamically relevant coordinates of the system are appropriately represented , so that all proximity relationships are correct and not due to lower - dimensional projection effects . in a similar spirit",
    ", the first root of the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of a time series often yields a good estimate for @xmath23 .",
    "a more refined method is to use time - delayed mutual information  @xcite .    while the aforementioned approaches to determining @xmath21 and @xmath23 commonly work well for data from deterministic dynamical systems , applying them to fbm leads to severe conceptual problems :    on the one hand",
    ", we note that the concepts of a fractal dimension has two aspects when being applied to a stochastic process instead of a deterministic dynamical system . from the phase space perspective",
    ", the fractal dimension is commonly defined as some scaling property described by a parameter that converges to a fixed value as @xmath26 and @xmath21 is sufficiently high .",
    "this fact is used , for example , in the famous grassberger - procaccia algorithm for estimating the correlation dimension @xmath27 of chaotic attractors  @xcite . however , according to the latter viewpoint , stochastic behavior is characterized by an absence of such convergence , formally leading to @xmath28 .",
    "finite estimates of @xmath27 are spurious due to the finite amount of data used .",
    "the latter result is reasonable since an infinite amount of data ( i.e. , the innovations at each time step ) are necessary to fully describe the evolution of a stochastic process .    as an alternative perspective , the fractal dimension of a stochastic process is often defined via the fractal dimension of its graph . for a one - dimensional process",
    ", this graph is represented in the @xmath29-plane , and its dimension is hence bound from above by @xmath30 .",
    "specifically , for fbm with a hurst exponent @xmath31 , it has been shown that @xmath32 , taking the different scaling behavior in association with the process self - similarity into account @xcite .",
    "however , the latter aspect is clearly distinct from the notion of fractal dimensions used in the phase space context .",
    "thus , from a conceptual perspective , the embedding dimension should be chosen infinitely large . in turn",
    ", finite @xmath21 will necessarily cause spurious results since the full complexity of the system s ( discrete ) trajectory is not captured .    on the other hand ,",
    "the embedding delay @xmath23 is not considered in the mathematical embedding theorems for deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "embeddings with the same embedding dimension @xmath21 but different @xmath23 are topologically equivalent in the mathematical sense  @xcite , but in reality a good choice of @xmath23 facilitates further analysis . if @xmath23 is small compared to the relevant internal time - scales of the system , successive elements of the delay vectors are strongly correlated .",
    "this leads to the practical requirement that the embedding delay should cover a much longer time interval than the largest characteristic time - scale that is relevant for the dynamics of the system .",
    "however , in fbm arbitrarily long time - scales are relevant due to the self - similar nature of the process .",
    "this makes finding a feasible value of @xmath23 a challenging ( and , regarding formal optimality criteria , even theoretically impossible ) task .    in summary",
    ", we emphasize that in the case of non - stationary fbm , the fundamental concepts of phase space reconstruction and low - dimensional dynamics do not apply ( not even approximately ) anymore .",
    "therefore , any attempt to applying rn analysis to fbm directly necessarily yields results that hold only for the particular embedding parameters chosen and the specific length of the given time series  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate some numerical results illustrating these points in more detail in the following .",
    "estimating the acf of a stationary time series at lag @xmath23 is straightforward as long as @xmath23 is small compared to the total length of the time series , @xmath33 .",
    "for stationary stochastic processes , the functional form and rate of decay of the acf depends on the specific properties of the process .",
    "specifically , for a stationary long - range correlated process , the acf decays like a power - law with the characteristic exponent being directly related with @xmath14  @xcite .     and ( b ) the corresponding acfs .",
    "( c ) average acfs taken over 200 independent realizations of fbm with the same hurst exponent @xmath14 .",
    "different line colors correspond to different values of @xmath14 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 in steps of @xmath34 ( from bottom to top at small @xmath23 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the time series length has been set to @xmath36 .",
    "( d ) as ( c ) for @xmath37 .",
    "[ fig : fbm_acf ] ]    in contrast to this , for the non - stationary fbm sample estimates of the acf decay extremely slowly beyond the `` normal '' behavior of stationary long - range dependent processes , which can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbm_acf ] ( in fact , the concept of acf is not appropriate for describing the serial dependence structure of non - stationary processes ) . specifically , we show three example trajectories of fbms with @xmath38 , @xmath36 and their corresponding nave acf estimates . due to the stochastic nature of the process , the de - correlation time ( which can be expressed as @xmath39 or @xmath40 , i.e. , the time lags after which the estimated acf has decayed to @xmath41 or @xmath42 , respectively )",
    "depends on the specific realization of the process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fbm_acf]b ) .",
    "even more , the corresponding ensemble spread does not exclusively originate from the finite sample size , but is enhanced by the inherent non - stationarity of fbm .    taking an ensemble average over a variety of independent realizations , we numerically observe that the location of the first root of the estimated acf hardly depends at all on the hurst exponent @xmath14 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbm_acf]c",
    ". however , as expected from theoretical study of fbm , it appears to systematically increase as the length of time series is increased to @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fbm_acf]d , note the different scales in figs .",
    "[ fig : fbm_acf]c and d ) . more specifically ,",
    "if we extend the length of the realization by a factor of 4 , the first root of the acf estimate also shifts to a four times larger lag .",
    "irrespective of the sample size @xmath33 , the spectrum of the fbm process has a significant amount of energy in frequencies that are not much larger than @xmath44 ( i.e. , in the low - frequency part ) .",
    "this explains why the first root of the acf estimate appears at larger time lags as @xmath33 is increased .",
    "consequently , the de - correlation time increases for longer time series . from the viewpoint of time - delay embedding (",
    "given it is performed disregarding the conceptual concerns detailed above ) , this hampers the proper choice of the embedding delay @xmath23 . in turn",

    "this is a rather large value , clearly far larger than those used by liu _ et  al .",
    "_  @xcite ( @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) .",
    "the determination of a reasonable embedding dimension @xmath21 is often achieved by the fnn method  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fgn_fnn ] ]      an appropriate choice of the recurrence threshold @xmath0 has attracted great interest in the literature on rns  @xcite .",
    "the most wide - spread procedure is fixing the resulting recurrence rate @xmath56 ( i.e. , the fraction of recurrences ) and adjusting @xmath0 accordingly . as a rule - of - thumb",
    ", @xmath56 is often taken between about 0.01 and 0.05 for typical rn sizes of a few thousand vertices  @xcite , presenting a trade - off between the necessity of avoiding a largely disconnected network ( too small @xmath57 ) and the interest in the geometric fine structure of the system in its phase space , which is hidden when considering too large spatial domains .",
    "the latter requirement has been more precisely formulated in @xcite , emphasizing on the empirically expected relationship for the rn s average path length , @xmath58 , which has been numerically confirmed @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested using the percolation threshold of the random geometric graph constructed from the given distribution of observed state vectors in phase space as a suitable lower bound to @xmath0 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the scaling of the rn s average path length breaks down if @xmath0 falls below the limit for which the rn decomposed into disjoint components , which is a necessary consequence of the fact that the averaging involved in the calculation of @xmath59 is commonly considered only over pairs of vertices that are mutually reachable  @xcite . however , when disregarding shortest path - based rn characteristics , there is no reason why one should restrict oneself to connected - networks , since other graph properties are hardly affected by the presence of more than one component . in particular , requesting the existence of a single component can lead to rather large @xmath0 due to the presence of outliers in the data  @xcite , especially in case of stochastic processes .    in this spirit , we recommend fixing @xmath56 at some reasonable value instead of tuning @xmath0 according to the percolation threshold .",
    "notably , in this case results obtained for different data sets still correspond to different @xmath0 when they originate from independent realizations of stochastic processes .",
    "however , the problem of the dependence of some network measures on the number of edges in the rn is relieved in this case .",
    "note that for fbm , due to the non - stationarity in variance the spread of state vectors in any reconstructed phase space necessarily grows with the sample size @xmath33 .",
    "based on our discussion presented in the previous section , we conclude that the results recently presented in  @xcite hold only for the particular choices of the algorithmic parameters ( for instance , length of time series , embeddings etc ) , showing limited physical interpretations . moreover , using non - stationary time series data necessarily produces unreliable and spurious results .",
    "one solution to the problem could be transforming the process in a way so that it becomes stationary . in recent applications to non - stationary real - world time series  @xcite , the authors have removed non - stationarities in the mean by removing averages taken within sliding windows from the data . in the particular case of fbm , where non - stationary affects the variance , the underlying stochastic process can be transformed into a stationary one by a first - order difference filter , i.e. , by considering its increments @xmath60 .",
    "the transformed series is commonly referred to as fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) in analogy with the classical brownian motion arising from an aggregation of gaussian innovations .",
    "notably , fgn retains the long - range correlations and gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) from the underlying fbm process . for illustration purposes , three independent realizations of fgn with the same characteristic hurst parameter @xmath38",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgn_acf]a .",
    "visual inspection clearly suggests the absence of non - stationarity in both mean and variance .",
    "because of its stationarity , for fgn the estimated acf shows a much faster decay and less ensemble spread than for fbm ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fgn_trans_m]a , b ) .    it would be straightforward to extend this kind of analysis to other network measures , since the available analytical description of rns allows for their calculation as well  @xcite .",
    "we leave a corresponding discussion as a subject of future work .",
    "by a critical reassessment of previous work  @xcite , we have identified several sources of errors when applying recurrence network analysis ( or , in a similar way , other concepts based on recurrences in phase space ) to long - range correlated stochastic processes . in summary ,",
    "the main conclusions of this analysis are as follows :    a.   rn analysis is based on phase space concepts originated in the theory of deterministic dynamical systems",
    ". therefore , its potential application to stochastic processes requires special care .",
    "b.   the rn theory  @xcite holds only for stationary processes .",
    "a direct application of rn analysis to typical non - stationary processes ( in particular fbm ) therefore has to fail , since the pdf of the process in the considered phase space changes with time . without correcting for non - stationarity by a proper transformation of the series , the obtained results are commonly spurious .",
    "c.   a major problem associated with non - stationary processes is that embedding can not be properly defined . in particular , the necessary selection of an embedding delay is ambiguous since auto - correlation function and related measures of serial dependences are not well - defined anymore . d.   for stationary stochastic processes , an embedding delay can be formally estimated from the data",
    ". however , the problem of selecting an embedding dimension remains , since stochastic processes are ( in the viewpoint of dynamical systems theory ) infinite - dimensional .",
    "hence , any low - dimensional embedding of a stochastic process necessarily loses relevant information , which is a major cause of spurious results .    despite the aforementioned conceptual problems and pitfalls resulting thereof",
    ", rn can still be used for obtaining interesting information on stationary stochastic processes .",
    "drawing upon the interpretation of rns as random geometric graphs  @xcite in some reconstructed phase space , the network properties could in principle be computed solely from the multi - dimensional pdf of the embedded process .",
    "deviations from the expectations are related to statistical dependencies between the different embedding components as well as finite - sample and finite - scale effects .",
    "the latter are also relevant for deterministic - chaotic processes , where in turn the underlying pdf can often not be calculated or at least estimated with high accuracy . in this spirit , deriving information based on stochastic processes can indeed help by providing benchmarks for studies of deterministic dynamics",
    ".    in general , applying rn analysis to scalar measurements requires an appropriate choice of embedding parameters .",
    "we do not claim that all choices made in this work have been based on fully objective quantitative criteria .",
    "the concepts like de - correlation time and false nearest - neighbors applied in this work rather present heuristics capturing only some aspects relevant for obtaining a proper phase space reconstruction . in this spirit , the results reported in  @xcite are conceptually interesting but practically difficult to interpret . for systematic applications ,",
    "the choice of embedding parameters depends on the particular process under consideration and should involve careful statistical evaluation beyond visual inspection .    finally , we emphasize that for non - stationary systems , embedding parameters can not be properly defined in general , so that any rn analysis ( as well as other time series analysis techniques ) necessarily yields systematic errors .",
    "this particularly applies to fbm and related processes arising from an integration of stationary processes ( e.g. , fractional lvy motion , ( f)arima models , etc . ) . in such cases ,",
    "a proper transformation is required to remove the particular type of non - stationarity from the data .",
    "this can be achieved by additive detrending , phase adjustment ( de - seasonalization ) , difference filtering ( incrementation ) or other techniques , with the one mentioned last being the proper tool for the particular case of fbm transforming the original process into stationary fgn . applying rn analysis to the latter indeed provides meaningful results .",
    "it should be noted that this observation is consistent with some wide - spread conceptual ideas beyond successful methodological alternatives for non - stationary time series analysis such as dfa  @xcite , which commonly make use of detrending and/or time series differentiation / aggregation .",
    "a more systematic exploration of corresponding approaches in combination with recurrence - based techniques is general , and rn analysis in particular , could be an interesting subject of future work .",
