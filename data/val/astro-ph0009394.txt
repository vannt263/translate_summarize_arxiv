    ", however , remains determined by the intersection of the sunyaev - zeldovich and lensing sample edges .",
    "if observable , the distinct features in the mass distribution of lensing sunyaev - zeldovich clusters have immediate physical implications .",
    "the first was already mentioned : all else fixed , the peak in the mass distribution contains indirect information on the thermal evolution of the cluster sample with redshift .",
    "second , the exponential cut - off at the high - mass end allows to determine the cluster mass function at redshift @xmath191 , where the majority of the cluster sample is located .",
    "third , the sharp cut - off at the low - mass end measures the intersection point between the two lines @xmath185 and @xmath186 . for a fixed cosmological model , @xmath192 is fixed , while @xmath193 is @xmath194 .",
    "equating the two expressions leads to @xmath195 the higher the baryon fraction is , the lower is the mass limit for detectable sunyaev - zeldovich clusters . likewise , for higher hubble constant , the angular - diameter distance to a fixed redshift is smaller , and lower - mass clusters can be seen .",
    "third , the location of the peak , if it exists , is determined by the lowest mass required for a cluster to be seen beyond the maximum in @xmath196 .",
    "this is fixed by the sunyaev - zeldovich detection criterion alone .",
    "it then follows from ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) that @xmath197 for increasing baryon fraction , the total cluster mass can be lower for the cluster to be seen , and likewise for a higher hubble constant .",
    "although in reality the relations between the low - mass cut - off and the peak position on the one hand and the baryon fraction on the other will be more complicated , these considerations show that the distinct features in the mass distribution contain information on various physical properties of the cluster population at moderate redshifts .",
    "it appears from the foregoing discussion of the location of cut - off and peak in the mass function of the combined cluster sample , that baryon fraction and hubble constant shift them in a completely parallel way .",
    "the real situation is somewhat more complex , for two reasons : first , hubble constant and baryon fraction are further related through constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "if @xmath198 is the density parameter of baryons , @xmath199 , but primordial nucleosynthesis determines the physical baryon density , hence @xmath200 . taking this into account , the baryon fraction itself scales with the hubble constant as @xmath201 .",
    "the diminution of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect with decreasing hubble constant as a consequence of increasing physical distances is therefore more than cancelled if the cluster baryon fraction follows the primordial nucleosynthesis constraint .",
    "second , the hubble constant also determines the shape parameter of the dark - matter power spectrum , @xmath202 .",
    "normalising the spectrum to the local abundance of rich clusters keeps the spectrum fixed at the linear cluster scale of @xmath203 . lowering @xmath204 shifts the peak of the spectrum to larger scales , leading to more power on larger and less power on smaller scales .",
    "this then leads to a higher abundance of more massive clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] illustrates these effects .     and fixed hubble constant , and for different hubble constants and fixed baryon fraction , as indicated in the plot .",
    "the solid , dotted , and short - dashed curves show that an increasing baryon fraction shifts the peak to lower masses , as expected , and increases the peak height , while keeping the exponential cut - off constant .",
    "the dot - dashed , dotted , and long - dashed curves show that an increasing hubble constant also shifts the peak towards lower masses , but also leads to lower amplitude in the exponential cut - off . ]",
    "the peak in the mass distribution shifts to lower masses as the baryon fraction or the hubble constant increase . while the amplitude of the exponential cut - off is unchanged while @xmath204 is kept fixed , it increases when @xmath204 decreases , as expected .",
    "the most prominent effect is the change in the peak height with baryon fraction .      the simple relation between @xmath105 and the cluster mass @xmath9 derived earlier and shown in fig .  [ fig:3b",
    "] can now be used to derive cluster masses .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:3.7 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.10 ] ) imply @xmath205 where @xmath125 and the definition ( [ eq:0.0 ] ) of @xmath7 have been inserted .",
    "because of the fairly narrow redshift range occupied by the cluster sample , and the low redshift where they are typically located , @xmath206 can be considered constant in redshift .",
    "what is more , @xmath207 in ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) is almost independent of cosmological parameters .",
    "changing @xmath94 from @xmath208 to @xmath209 changes @xmath207 by less than 5 per cent . for an aperture radius of @xmath210 , we find @xmath211 and this relation continues to hold even for moderatly high cluster redshifts .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to determine the absolute masses of the clusters in the combined gravitationally lensing sunyaev - zeldovich cluster sample .    in order to test the accuracy of this mass determination",
    ", we have randomly drawn a set of clusters from the number - density distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , with the total number computed for a flat , low - density , cluster normalised cdm universe . for each of these clusters",
    ", we computed the aperture mass @xmath212 for an aperture radius of @xmath210 , and then used eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) to infer its virial mass .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] compares the inferred and true masses , binned in such a way that each bin contains the same number of clusters .     on an angular scale of @xmath210",
    "was calculated and converted to mass via eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) .",
    "each data point shows the median mass derived from an equal number of clusters .",
    "error bars show the @xmath213 deviation from the mean , i.e.  they would correspond to 1-@xmath214 error bars if the distribution was gaussian . ]",
    "data points show the median of the inferred masses in each bin , and error bars enclose the @xmath213 deviation from the median , i.e.  they loosely correspond to 1-@xmath214 error bars . as fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] shows , the accuracy of the inferred cluster masses is of order @xmath215 .",
    "the distribution of clusters as a function of @xmath105 prominently reflects the peak in the mass distribution , as fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows .",
    ", this figure shows the distribution of clusters as a function of @xmath105 rather than mass .",
    "five curves are shown to illustrate the effects of changing baryon fraction and hubble constant , as indicated . ]    using ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) , the true mass corresponding to the peak location in the mass function can accurately be determined from the peak in the @xmath105 distribution .",
    "the @xmath105 distribution shows the same behaviour in reaction to changes in baryon fraction and hubble constant as the mass distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "in particular , the peak height changes substantially with the baryon fraction , and much less so with the hubble constant .",
    "relation ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) holds for clusters with an nfw density profile .",
    "it is valid because the aperture - mass profile is essentially flat for small aperture sizes , so that a weak - lensing estimate inside an area with fixed angular size can be used to extract a global halo property .",
    "generally , the cluster mass profile needs to be known in order to relate aperture masses to virial masses .",
    "surface - density profiles of clusters can be constrained with the same weak - lensing data used to determine the aperture masses , so that masses can be determined from weak lensing even if the true profile deviates from the nfw form .    however , the conversion from aperture mass to virial mass is not necessary for the extraction of cosmological information from the combined gravitationally lensing sunyaev - zeldovich cluster sample .",
    "rather , one can use weak - lensing quantities to classify clusters , and then use direct weak - lensing simulations to compare models to data .",
    "full - sky microwave surveys like the upcoming _ planck _ mission will detect of order @xmath0 galaxy clusters through their thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect . using modified press - schechter theory in cdm model universes normalised to the local abundance of rich clusters , and scaling relations derived from the spherical collapse model , we have investigated the physical properties which that cluster sample is expected to have .",
    "we have then addressed the question what additional information can be gained by weak - lensing follow - up observations of the clusters in the sunyaev - zeldovich sample .",
    "for doing so , we described individual clusters with the density profile of navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and applied the aperture mass as a measure for their weak - lensing effects .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    * taking beam convolution and background fluctuations into account , the number of sunyaev - zeldovich clusters detectable for _ planck _ is a few times @xmath0 if a baryon fraction of @xmath216 is kept fixed , quite independent of the cosmological parameters . if the baryon fraction is adapted to the primordial nucleosynthesis constraint , it drops with increasing @xmath94 , and the number of detectable sunyaev - zeldovich clusters falls by a factor of @xmath99 as @xmath94 increases from @xmath208 to @xmath209 .",
    "* one particular measure of weak gravitational lensing , the aperture mass , effectively determines the convergence scale @xmath139 for a cluster described by an nfw density profile , and the einstein radius for a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "the aperture - mass profile of clusters depends sensitively on the density profile . while it falls with aperture size @xmath103 as @xmath120 for singular isothermal spheres , it is much flatter for a nfw haloes . * the significantly lensing sub - sample comprises more than @xmath100 of the original sunyaev - zeldovich cluster sample .",
    "the combined sample is narrowly confined in redshift and mass .",
    "the majority of redshifts fall within @xmath2 , and the masses within @xmath3 .",
    "approximate analytic descriptions of the sample s number density in the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane are given .",
    "* because of the narrow redshift range and the generally low cluster redshifts , the weak - lensing effects are virtually independent of the source redshift distribution . under these circumstances",
    ", the aperture mass essentially measures the radial scale of the nfw density profile , which can easily be converted to virial mass .",
    "the relation @xmath145 holds to very good approximation .",
    "cluster masses can be determined with that relation with an accuracy of @xmath4 . *",
    "the mass distribution of the combined cluster sample exhibits a sharp low - mass cutoff and an exponential decrease at high masses . for low - density universes ,",
    "the mass distribution has a sharp peak near @xmath5 .",
    "the low - mass cutoff is due to the lack of significant lensing effects in low - mass sunyaev - zeldovich clusters , since they have low redshifts .",
    "the high - mass fall - off reflects the exponential decline in the cluster mass function .",
    "the peak occurs at the minimum mass required for a cluster to be a detectable sunyaev - zeldovich source at all redshifts .",
    "this is possible because the squared angular diameter distance , divided by @xmath168 , has a maximum at a finite redshift @xmath217 .",
    "the peak occurs if clusters exist at such redshifts , i.e.  in low - density universes .",
    "* the cluster mass at the peak location can accurately be measured if the cluster density profile is known . in combination with the exponential high - mass cut - off of the mass distribution , the peak location allows the determination of the amplitude of the dark - matter power spectrum and the baryon fraction in the intracluster gas .    of course",
    ", we rely on the validity of press - schechter theory , as modified by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) and jenkins et al .",
    "the mass function derived by jenkins et al .  from numerical simulations",
    "agrees very well with the analytical expression by sheth & tormen , showing that there are good reasons to believe that the mass function used here approximates reality sufficiently closely .",
    "although all our results were derived under the assumption that clusters have the density profile found by navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , this assumption is not critical for the results .",
    "the property shown , that the aperture mass becomes independent of aperture size for small apertures , is convenient for our purpose in that it facilitates the conversion of aperture masses to virial masses , but by no means necessary .",
    "the nfw density profile has recently been disputed by studies finding a steeper central density cusp ( e.g.  moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , albeit on radial scales much smaller than probed by weak - lensing techniques .",
    "weak lensing observations will allow the determination of the mass profile .",
    "the fact that the combined gravitationally lensing sunyaev - zeldovich cluster sample is confined to a fairly narrow , low - redshift range implies that weak - lensing results become essentially independent of the source - redshift distribution .",
    "it therefore appears safe to conclude that cluster samples selected by their thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect and combined with weak - lensing follow - up observations , are well confined in redshift and mass , and provide a unique opportunity to accurately measure the cluster mass function at redshifts around @xmath93 , thus the amplitude of the dark - matter power spectrum , and the baryon fraction in the intracluster gas .    the most prominent feature in the mass function of the combined gravitationally lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich cluster sample is the pronounced peak predicted to occur for low - density universes .",
    "its physical origin is the flattening of the relation between angular - diameter distance and redshift away from hubble s law due to space - time curvature , and the thermal history of the cluster population , for which the spherical collapse model predicts that temperature rises as @xmath168 for fixed cluster mass . adopting this model",
    ", we saw that location and height of the peak provide additional information on the intracluster baryon fraction .",
    "it is highly likely that the microwave background observations leading to the compilation of the sunyaev - zeldovich cluster sample will allow accurate determinations of the cosmological parameters including the baryon fraction ( e.g.  efstathiou & bond 1999 ) .",
    "the gravitational - lensing follow - up observations will then supply valuable tests for the consistency between the detected and expected cluster populations , and additional information on the thermal history of the cluster population .",
    "finally , it appears recommendable to avoid the conversion from weak - lensing measures like the aperture mass to virial mass .",
    "it is equally possible to define a cluster sample not by its mass , but operationally by the integrated sunyaev - zeldovich decrement or increment and weak - lensing measures like the aperture mass . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig:7 ] and [ fig:9 ] shows that the aperture - mass distribution exhibits the same features as the mass distribution itself .",
    "uncertainties in the conversion between lensing effects and masses could be avoided if measured aperture - mass distributions would directly be compared to simulations such as those leading to the results shown in fig .",
