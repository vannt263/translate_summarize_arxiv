    "stochastic methods are lately being profusely used in quantum mechanics in general and in quantum optics in particular to better study and analyze the physical processes taking place during the interaction between the system and the measuring apparatus .",
    "the conceptual framework is very clear , consisting in an open quantum system which is being continuously monitorized by an appropiate device .",
    "this situation is very well described using stochastic unravellings for the lindblad equation of the system density operator , the most general expression of which for the diffusive case has been recently given in @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the presence of an observer is compulsory for orthodox quantum principles to be applied .",
    "on the other hand , in the early years of quantum mechanics , the role of the observer was crucial to both justify the indeterministic nature of the results of a measurement upon quantum systems @xcite and to understand the lack of quantum interference in a , say , double - slit experiment .",
    "nowadays it is understood that this lack of interference is not strictly due to the presence of the observer , but to the possibility of knowing which path the particle followed @xcite .",
    "keeping orthodox principles @xcite as far as possible , the role of the observer is then left as the only justification to set the indeterminism in the measurement process of quantum systems .    in this article , we take under consideration the possibility of reducing once more the role of the observer and study the consequences of letting quantum systems have an intrinsic stochastic nature . in the same fashion , this hypothesis has already given rise to different stochastic evolution models ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein to previous works ) , the main purpose of which was to reproduce faithfully all nonrelativistic quantum predictions with the sole exception of quantum superpositions among macroscopically distinguishable states .",
    "by concentrating upon a very simple quantum system , namely a two - level system , we will show how this stochastic assumption allows us to make predictions only restricted to relativistic extensions of quantum mechanics ( qed ) or only achievable by resorting to the theory of open quantum systems .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the nonrelativistic domain , i.e. we will keep on using state vectors to describe physical systems , something which is impossible to do in an attempt to merge relativistic principles with quantum theory .",
    "the main physical hypothesis we address here is the possibility of endowing the evolution operator of a quantum system with stochastic nature . to be concrete",
    "we will deal with a two - level quantum system in particular .",
    "this assumption has already been done in another places ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite for a general overview ) and can be alternatively motivated in two ways . on one hand any system , whether quantum or classical , is continuously subjected to the external influence of its environment , however small the said influence may be .",
    "this standpoint is assumed in the program of decoherence , in fact it is its conceptual starting point @xcite .",
    "such external influences are , needless to say , uncontrollable , so we may encode them using stochastic methods .",
    "this way of proceeding is similar to for instance the modelling of the evolution of a lorentz particle @xcite . in van kampen s terminology",
    "it corresponds to what he calls _ external noise _ which is due essentially to the huge amount of uncontrollable external factors that affect the system evolution .    alternatively , we may adopt the complementary point of view , stating that the stochasticity arises just as _ internal _ noise ( cf . again",
    "this second standpoint is subtler and , in our opinion , much less intuitive but hopefully more accurate .",
    "let us use a canonical example ( which will be extensively studied below ) , a two - level quantum system in electromagnetic vacuum . within the non - relativistic quantum - mechanical standpoint the evolution of this system",
    "is completely determined by its hamiltonian @xmath0 and since the latter is time - independent , the system is stationary , i.e. the energy does not change . within qed framework ,",
    "the description varies to include the effect of _ vacuum fluctuations_. these fluctuations , quantum in nature , drive the system to its ground energy level , thus producing _ spontaneous _ decay .",
    "this situation can also be understood letting the system be modelled by stochastic evolution , rooting the stochasticity in this quantum vacuum . since these fluctuations do not occur in real ordinary space , but in hilbert space we use stochastic evolution operators to describe them .",
    "the term _ internal _ is in this situation a bit dubious , since the electromagnetic vacuum can hardly be thought as internal to the two - level system .",
    "we should understand then _ internal _ as making reference to the essence itself of the system . as a matter of fact",
    "this vacuum is only detectable through its effects on a quantum system , so in certain sense the evolution of the system should also contain such effects .    from a mathematical point of view the question of the origin of",
    "the stochasticity is secondary and eveything reduces to find the form of such a stochastic evolution operator .",
    "so we proceed by substituting @xmath1 and then investigating the form of @xmath2 . to do this we resort to a general decomposition theorem of real random variables @xcite the generalization to ( bounded ) operator - valued random variables of which we take for granted .",
    "[ decompth ] let @xmath3 be an operator - valued random variable acting upon a n - dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "then there exist @xmath5 operator - valued processes @xmath6 such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the expectation value with respect to the probability measure and @xmath9 are @xmath10 complex wiener processes .",
    "expressing the latter integral as a function of the upper interval limit ( @xmath11 ) we may write as the more general form for a stochastic evolution operator    @xmath12    where in general the wiener processes will have the covariance matrix given by    @xmath13=a_{kk'}t.\\ ] ]    the connection with ordinary quantum mechanics is made by stating    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the system density operator induced by the previous stochastic evolution operator , namely    @xmath16    henceforward , we adopt the same assumptions as in the orthodox formalism , in particular we force trace - preserving evolution",
    ". this immediately imposes conditions on the absolute value of @xmath17 , as the following proposition shows :    [ expval ] if @xmath18 is defined as ( [ densop ] ) and @xmath19 , then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a selfadjoint operator .",
    "appendix a.    a few comments should be included .",
    "firstly the selfadjoint operator @xmath21 is to be identified with the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "secondly note , as expected , that if @xmath22 , then we recover the usual quantum - mechanical formalism , thus reinforcing the idea that new effects are contained only in the stochastic part of the evolution operator , leaving the hamiltonian partial evolution unchanged .",
    "thirdly the square root imposes restriction upon @xmath23 since    @xmath24    must hold for all @xmath25 .",
    "finally @xmath2 is not an unitary operator , unitarity is only obtained in stochastic average , i.e.    @xmath26=i.\\ ] ]    this last feature is the crucial difference with other stochastic evolution schemes showing the same philosophy ( specially those assumed in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "there , as in the scheme we propose here , it is assumed a basic stochastic evolution described by two operators , namely the hamiltonian @xmath21 ( for the deterministic part ) and an _ ad hoc _ operator @xmath27 which gives rise to the lindblad operator @xcite after the whole calculation is carried on .",
    "nevertheless the stochastic nature appears only as a modification of the evolution operator generator .",
    "for instance example 30.1 of @xcite proposes the _ ansatz _    @xmath28=\\mathbb{e}[e^{iw_{t}l}\\rho(0)e^{-iw_{t}l}],\\ ] ]    thus obtaining a lindblad - type generator    @xmath29=\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { [ lx , l]+[l , xl ] \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    this is straightforwardly generalized to more than one lindblad operator @xmath30 . in a simpler and more intuitive form much the same it is arrived at in @xcite .",
    "they only confer stochastic nature to the evolution operator by adding random parts to its generator , thus obtaining some further restrictions on the final evolution , such as only selfadjoint lindblad operators and consequently not achieving the desirable most general situation ( any lindblad operator ) .",
    "parthasarathy has however provided a scheme to obtain general lindblad evolution , namely he has proposed the evolution    @xmath31=\\mathbb{e}[u^{\\dagger n(t)}xu^{n(t)}],\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is poisson process with intensity @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "needless to say , though he arrives at a lindblad generator @xmath35+[l,\\cdot l^{\\dagger } ] \\right\\}$ ] , the physical interpretation of such a stochastic evolution operator is rather evasive .",
    "so we find that to keep the intuitive approach of adler , we must sacrifice some generality whereas on the other hand to arrive at such generality as parthasarathy we lose physical intuition . in order to conjugate both characteristics ,",
    "we have assumed a less restrictive position .",
    "however this generality does not drive us directly to a lindblad evolution as we shall see .",
    "some restrictions should be made on the added random parts @xmath6 .",
    "these restrictions possess , as the whole scheme , a rather intuitive physical interpretation . to see how the lindblad evolution appears we focus on the differential version of ( [ densop ] ) .",
    "the starting point is the following    if @xmath36 is defined as ( [ densop ] ) , then it satisfies the differential equation @xmath37+\\widetilde{l}_{t}[\\rho(0)],\\ ] ]    where for any @xmath3    @xmath38&=&-i[h , x]+{\\nonumber}\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{nm=1}^{n^{2}}a_{nm}\\left([\\ell_{n}(t)x,\\ell_{m}^{\\dagger}(t)]+[\\ell_{n}(t),x\\ell_{m}^{\\dagger}(t)]\\right){\\nonumber}\\\\ & & \\\\",
    "\\widetilde{l}_{t}[x]&=&-\\sum_{nm=1}^{n^{2}}a_{nm}l_{t}[\\int_{0}^{t}v_{n}(s)xv_{m}^{\\dagger}(s)ds]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and by construction we have defined    @xmath39^{-1}(t).\\ ] ]    this result is straighforwardly obtained by deriving with respect to time the expression of @xmath18 ( [ densop ] ) in which we use expression ( [ expvalopevol ] ) for @xmath2 and identifying the previous definitions .",
    "the equation ( [ difevoldensop ] ) is almost a lindblad differential equation .",
    "there are only two differences :    1 .",
    "there is an extra term @xmath40 $ ] which spoils the markovianity .",
    "this on the other hand is also obtained in the more general quantum evolution of a subsystem in the orthodox formalism ( cf .",
    "@xcite or @xcite ) . the physical conditions to be met to guarantee markovianity must be found .",
    "the would - be lindblad operators @xmath41 are time - dependent .",
    "though time - dependent lindblad operators can be found in the literature ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) , this is not the usual case upon which we will focus .",
    "thus we must find the conditions under which on one hand @xmath40=0 $ ] holds and on the other hand @xmath42 . in the next section we will comprehensively analyzed a two - level system to gain more physical insight into the question instead of trying to obtain the general conditions .",
    "however notice that a first partial general result can be obtained as to the energy preserving or not preserving nature of the fluctuation part @xmath43 once the second term @xmath40 $ ] is shown to be negligible :    both @xmath44=0 $ ] and @xmath45=0 $ ] are independent sufficient conditions on their own to get energy conservation , i.e.    @xmath46    its elementary using ( [ difevoldensop ] ) with @xmath40=0 $ ] and the cyclic property of the trace .",
    "this result may be useful to check whether we have a decaying or pumping interaction or on the contrary we just have a decohering but energy - preserving evolution ( see below ) .    before working out the announced two - level quantum system example , we will briefly state where the main differences between previous stochastic quantum evolution models and our scheme are .",
    "let us consider the quantum state diffusion model ( cf .",
    "this model corresponds to stochastic unravellings of the lindblad equation under the hypothesis of state - vector normalization , which is implemented in the following way .",
    "if the stochastic state - vector satisfies the qsd equation    @xmath47    then the normalization preservation is achieved by forcing    @xmath48    as @xmath49 must stochastically unravel the lindblad equation , then    @xmath50.\\ ] ]    the qsd unravelling for the lindblad equation with one lindblad operator is    @xmath51    where @xmath27 denote the lindblad operator entering the corresponding lindblad equation and @xmath52 denotes white noise ( cf .",
    "note that this equation is * non - local * and * non - linear*. the difference with the scheme proposed here is double .",
    "firstly we do not assume the lindblad equation as a starting hypothesis , we arrive at it only after finding some physical conditions ( cf .",
    "secondly we do not impose normalization of @xmath49 , we only impose the condition    @xmath53=1,\\ ] ]    i.e. normalization in stochastic average .",
    "to better appreciate these differences , we will explicitly write down the evolution equation for @xmath49 derived from the evolution operator ( [ stevoloper ] ) :    @xmath54    notice that this equation is * linear * and , under appropiate elections of @xmath43 , * local*. notice also the explicit appearance of @xmath55 , in consonance with the most general evolution equation for an open quantum system @xcite .",
    "but qsd is not the unique diffusive stochastic unravelling for the lindblad equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as a matter of fact",
    "it is included as a particular case of the stochastic evolution equation given by disi and wiseman .",
    "again , in their approach the lindblad equation is assumed from the very beginning , which settles the first difference with the formalism proposed here .",
    "secondly , as a consequence of the assumed conceptual framework ( a quantum system being continuously monitorized ) , they impose the condition of purity conservation for the stochastic evolution , which gives rise to the main analytical difference , since in our approach @xmath56 , as we have indicated above .",
    "unitarity is only satisfied in stochastic average ( cf .",
    "( [ stunit ] ) ) .",
    "differences can also be found with the work of ghirardi , pearle and rimini @xcite . there",
    "the lindblad equation is not assumed from the beginning , but it is arrived at after imposing some other conditions . among them ,",
    "the most important one is , in our opinion , the election of the quantity to be containing the physical information of the quantum system .",
    "their starting stochastic evolution equation is * linear * and ( if appropiate elections are made ) * local * , just as in our approach :    @xmath57    but they claim that , since this evolution does not preserve normalization , the physical information can not be contained in @xmath58 .",
    "so they define another stochastic vector @xmath59 by    @xmath60    with probability function given by the probability function corresponding to @xmath58 times their squared norm @xmath61 , i.e.    @xmath62    where @xmath63 denotes the probability associated to @xmath64 and @xmath65 denotes the probability associated to @xmath49 .",
    "this assumption leads immediately to the * nonlinear * stochastic differential equation    @xmath66|\\phi\\rangle dt + ( \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{r}_{\\phi})|\\phi\\rangle\\cdot d\\mathbf{b},\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 denotes the non - null elements of the diagonal covariance matrix of the set of wiener processes @xmath68 and @xmath69 . now the difference is rooted in the assumption that in our approach nonnormalization does not suppose a major nuisance , since we claim that the physical information of the system is contained in    @xmath70,\\ ] ]    so that the probability of finding a system in the state @xmath71 will be    @xmath72.\\ ] ]    and it is the physical quantity ( [ densop2 ] ) which is to be normalized .",
    "thus we do not need to resort to some other normalized process @xmath59 .",
    "finally , though being very close in spirit , some differences can also be remarked with the work of gisin @xcite .",
    "here the objective is to classify all the pure state valued stochastic differential equations in @xmath73 such that the corresponding density matrix follows a quantum dynamical semigroup evolution .",
    "the first formal difference stems form the fact that he describes the stochastic evolution in terms of the `` height '' and azimutal angle of the corresponding point in the bloch sphere , thus preventing its analysis from being generalized to higher - level systems in a straightforward fashion .",
    "moreover he only focus on pure states in contrast to our density matrix formalism , which also embraces mixture states .",
    "last of all , again as in previous commented models , the evolution equation for the density operator is assumed from the beginning , though the restriction of complete positivity is not guaranteed in his analysis .",
    "we begin by considering non - perturbed systems , i.e. with hamiltonian of the form    @xmath74    the reason to focus only on non - perturbed hamiltonians will be clear in the next section . as usual",
    "e.g. @xcite ) we may choose @xmath75 , thus we write    @xmath76    as a canonical example we may consider an atom in electromagnetic vacuum .",
    "the random part of the stochastic evolution operator may be written in the energy eigenvector basis as    @xmath77    this is the most general form . to clearly understand the physical meaning of each of the previous four terms we will start by considering them one by one .",
    "thus let us study the evolution induced by a stochastic evolution operator of the form    @xmath78^{1/2}{\\nonumber}\\\\ & + & \\int_{0}^{t}v(s)dw_{s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the stochastic expectation value has already been written to preserve the trace , @xmath43 is one of the previous @xmath79 s ( @xmath80 being the canonical basis of @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 is the complex standard wiener process . as a first result we elementarily arrive at @xmath40=0 $ ] for any election of @xmath43 , so",
    "markovianity is straightforwardly achieved . to obtain time - independent lindblad operators ,",
    "we insert sucessively each @xmath43 in the definition of @xmath83 ( eq . ( [ lindblads ] ) ) . forcing time - independency sets an ordinary differential equation for @xmath84 whose solution leaves as the only option for @xmath85 the expression    @xmath86    the lindblad operators produced in this way are of the form    @xmath87    the physical interpretation is rather intuitive .",
    "if for instance we choose @xmath88 , then we obtain an energy - preserving decohering evolution denote the @xmath89th entry of the density matrix @xmath36 .",
    "] , i.e.    @xmath90+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}{\\left(\\begin{array}{cc }                                \\hspace*{-1.5 mm } 0 & -\\rho_{12}(t)\\hspace*{-1.5 mm } \\\\                                \\hspace*{-1.5 mm } -\\rho_{21}(t ) & 0\\hspace*{-1.5 mm }                                 \\end{array } \\right)}.\\ ] ]    this means that @xmath91 represents a vacuum - system interaction which does not change the energy of the system , but that introduces decohering factors .",
    "notice that exactly the same equation ( [ onlydecoh ] ) would have been obtained had we chosen @xmath92 .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that whereas @xmath91 represents an interaction through coupling to the excited energy level , @xmath93 represents a similar interaction but coupled to the ground energy level .",
    "graphically the situation can be represented as in fig .",
    "[ decohfactors ] .    ,",
    "width=321 ]    this same interpretation can be carried over to the other two terms .",
    "for instance , for @xmath94 the final evolution equation is    @xmath95+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}{\\left(\\begin{array}{cc }                                \\hspace*{-1.5 mm } -2\\rho_{22}(t ) & -\\rho_{12}(t)\\hspace*{-1.5 mm } \\\\",

    "this behaviour is indeed exactly what is obtained by orthodox means ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite and fig .",
    "[ spondecay ] ) .",
    "the reverse behaviour , as expected , is achieved if we choose @xmath96 . in these two cases",
