    "in the context of understanding the distribution of dark matter in galaxies , early - type galaxies in the centers of galaxy clusters play an important role . in these places ,",
    "the highest dark matter densities are found and accordingly , the transition between luminous and dark matter dominated regions can be best investigated . in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies this can be done by long slit spectroscopy measuring integrated spectral line profiles ( see kronawitter et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and gerhard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a large sample of galaxies ) .    in the outer region of an elliptical galaxy  in an area where dark matter begins to dominate ",
    "this approach is hardly feasible due to the low surface brightness .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) , which can be traced to large radii , are the best tools to study the dynamics at larger radii",
    ". however , the distribution of radial velocities of particles is degenerate with respect to the galaxy mass profile and the orbital structure of the dynamical probes ( e.g. merritt & tremblay @xcite ) .",
    "if no other constraints on the velocity dispersion tensor and mass distribution are available , then radial velocities for several hundred or more clusters are required to break this degeneracy ( e.g. , merritt @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if we want to lift this degeneracy , we are limited to those nearby large elliptical galaxies with sufficiently populous cluster systems .",
    "m87 is such a candidate in the northern hemisphere .",
    "cohen & ryzhov @xcite observed about 200 radial velocities , using the keck telescope . this sample has been improved and enlarged to about 350 velocities ( ct et al .",

    "a typical uncertainty of their velocities is 150km / sec .",
    "another contribution comes from minniti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who used the eso multi - mode instrument at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope to measure velocities of 19 gcs .",
    "their velocity uncertainties are also large : the mean uncertainty is 128km / sec . the velocities with the smallest errors available",

    "( @xcite ) , kronawitter et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , gerhard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    in order to greatly improve our knowledge of its gcs kinematics and galaxy halo dynamics",
    ", we used the fors2 at the vlt to obtain spectra of globular clusters out to a radial distance of 8 which corresponds to approximately 45kpc .",
    "a distance modulus of @xmath2 ( 19mpc ) is used ( see dirsch et al .",
    "@xcite and discussion therein ) .",
    "the observations aim at a significant improvement in the number and quality of dynamical probes .",
    "the selected cluster candidates have luminosities brighter than @xmath3mag . an ideal telescope to obtain the required spectra of such faint objects in the southern hemisphere",
    "is the eso very large telescope .",
    "a spectroscopic resolution of approximately 3  is desirable for our task and thus fors2 with the mxu ( * m*ask e*x*change * u*nit ) is an appropriate instrument since it allows the simultaneous observation of some 100 objects .    in this article",
    "we present the data analysis and error discussion of our measurements .",
    "the complete dataset of 502 cluster velocities is presented which is the basis of the dynamical analysis published in paperii .",
    "these papers are part of a bigger effort to study the dynamics and stellar content of ngc 1399 , which also includes new photometric wide field observations published in paperi .",
    "the preparation of the slit masks we used for observing ngc1399 at the vlt is an important step in the overall investigation .",
    "hence , we describe this first step in detail , before discussing the observations themselves .",
    "our candidates gcs have been selected on the basis of new wide - field photometry in washington c and kron - cousins r of the cluster system of ngc 1399 , obtained at the ctio 4 m mosaic system . for a description of the photometric observations the reader",
    "is referred to paperi .    for the point source selection we used a color criterion ( @xmath4 ) and also a morphological criterion based on the sextractor class ( bertin & arnout @xcite ;",
    "only objects with _ class _ larger than 0.8 are retained , based on artificial star experiments and comparison with the vlt preimages .",
    "this morphological selection limited our sample to objects brighter than r=23.3mag which allows us to obtain the required signal - to - noise in the spectra .    for accurate slit placement on the mxu masks ,",
    "preimaging is required .",
    "service mode observations with fors2 at the vlt in october 2000 provided us with four fors2 fields , each of them @xmath5 , arranged in a quadratic configuration ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "each field has been exposed for 30sec in johnson v. we identified the selected clusters in these images and placed the slits accordingly . since the vlt images had superior seeing ( around @xmath6 ) , compared to our mosaic observations , we used them to check the star - like appearance of the selected objects .",
    "this left us with about 500 globular cluster candidates .    a major point during the preparation of the masks , which was done with the eso fors instrumental mask simulator ( fims ) ,",
    "were the choices of the slit width and particularly the slit lengths .",
    "we decided for a slit width of 1@xmath7 , which turned out to be appropriate for the normally sub - arcsecond seeing conditions .",
    "the slit length was a more complicated issue .",
    "the spectra of our fainter targets are sky - dominated and the sky subtraction is best done by measuring object and sky in the same slit . however , the severe disadvantage with slits of the appropriate length , 5@xmath7 or longer , is that they would cover up many objects which otherwise would have been observable with smaller length , contrary to our objective of observing as many targets as possible .",
    "moreover , it considerably lowers the flexibility of choosing slit positions according to the random location of targets with a high surface number density in a mask .",
    "therefore , we decided to set sky slits independently from the object slits and to subtract the sky after the wavelength calibration , trusting in its accuracy",
    ".    for most slits , the size then was @xmath8 , being @xmath9 only for the few bright objects ( normally foreground stars ) , which were needed to accurately position the mask . in this manner , we could fill a mask with up to 120 slits , typically 40 cluster candidates , 40 sky slits , and many miscellaneous objects , among them other point sources not matching our strict selection criteria , or background galaxies .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of the final sample for which we obtained velocities is shown in fig.[fig : spec_cmd ] together with its color distribution that is compared to the color distribution of the total mosaic sample within the same radial range .",
    "this figure illustrates that the final sample is not subject to color selection effects .",
    "the observations have been performed during 30.11.2.12.2000 at the european southern observatory at cerro paranal with the very large telescope facility .",
    "the telescope was ut2 ( kueyen ) and the instrument the focal reducer fors2 , equipped with the mxu .",
    "the detector was a site si-424a backside thinned ccd with a pixel size of 24@xmath1024 microns .",
    "the total field of view is @xmath11 .",
    "the observations are summarized in table[tab : observations ] .",
    "the four vlt fields in which the masks were placed are shown overlayed on a dss image of ngc1399 in fig.[fig : masks ] .",
    "we used the 600b grism without filter , which provides a resolution of around 2.5 .",
    "the spectral range covered was about 2000  .",
    "however , due to the position of a given slit in the mask , the limiting short- and long wavelengths varied considerably , ranging from 3500  to 6500  . in most cases ,",
    "the grism efficiency degraded the signal - to - noise short - wards of 3800  drastically , so this region could not be used .",
    "mask 89 has been observed using the 300v grism with a lower spectral resolution ( 110 / mm ) .",
    "this has been done to see the effect of using a certain grism .",
    "the analysis showed no difference in the quality of the derived velocities for the two grisms .",
    "we exposed 13 masks ( exposure times were either 45 min or 2@xmath1045 min ) .",
    "the seeing was always sub - arcsecond and ranged from @xmath6 to @xmath12 .",
    "flat - fielding was done with standard lamp flats . for the wavelength calibration ,",
    "a hehgcd lamp was exposed during service day - time calibration .",
    "the total number of spectra obtained is 1462 .",
    "this sample is composed of 531 sky spectra ( see table[tab : efficiency ] ) , 512 spectra of cluster candidates , 190 spectra of point sources of unknown nature at the time of mask preparation ( stars , unresolved galaxies or globular clusters ) , 176 galaxies , and 53 `` bright '' objects , mainly stars which were needed to adjust the mask . since some objects ( about 80 )",
    "have been observed in two different masks in order to assess the velocity uncertainties , the total number of objects is smaller by this number than the number of spectra .",
    "there are two reasons why we found clusters in the ( randomly selected ) point source sample : firstly , the mosaic data is not dithered and thus for a considerable fraction of clusters no photometry was obtained . secondly , our employed morphological selection criteria were very strict and the completeness of faint cluster identification was rather low ( see also paper i ) .",
    "table [ tab : observations ] lists the relevant data of the observations , starting with the number of the respective fors field , the mask number , the center coordinates ( j2000 ) , the exposure time ( 90 min means that two exposures of 45 min have been stacked ) .",
    "the basic reduction ( bias subtraction , flatfielding , trimming ) has been done with standard procedures within iraf . for the later extraction of the spectra the _ apextract _",
    "package has been used .    regarding the removal of cosmic rays",
    ", we found after some experimenting that the task filter / cosmics under midas gave the most satisfactory results .",
    "a few artefacts remained in spite of that , best visible in the faint spectra .    in the flat - fielded image",
    "the spectra have a separation of only a few pixels and are curved along the dispersion axis which has to be fitted before they can be extracted .",
    "the curvature is strongest at the frame edges , where the deviation from the center to the edge is approximately 6pixels .",
    "we traced each spectrum along the dispersion axis on the flatfield image of the mask because of their much clearer signal .",
    "we then kept the tracing parameters and optimized the size of the apertures with the goal to minimize the sky contribution in the object spectra which has been done on the science spectra .",
    "the final sizes of the apertures depend on the seeing and varies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . on some masks a few spectra overlap which have been excluded from further analysis .",
    "we employed the iraf task _ identify _ to calibrate both object and sky spectra .",
    "typically around 18 he , hg and cd - lines were kept for the line - list .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is @xmath15 .",
    "the bright oi skyline at 5567  which is present in all spectra can be used to correct zero point differences between the masks .",
    "differences up to @xmath16  have been found .",
    "the reason for these systematic differences is the uncertainty in the mask placement which is cited in the mxu manual to be 13microns .",
    "this is approximately half a pixel or 0.6  using the 600b grism and thus in good agreement with our measured zero point differences .    within a mask the position of the oi sky line was constant to within 0.04  consistent with the calibration uncertainty .",
    "an exception is mask # 89 ( with the grism 300v ) , where we found a systematic linear increase / decrease of the oi line position from 5566.3  to 5567.91 .",
    "we corrected for this with a linear interpolation in the wavelength calibration .",
    "the systematic behavior in mask#89 is probably due to a slight rotation of the mask .    for the sky subtraction we used spectra that were observed through slits placed in empty sky areas .",
    "for each object adjacent sky spectra within a certain radial distance from ngc1399 have been selected to attempt to obtain the best sky spectrum .",
    "the radial width of these annuli had been chosen to be smaller near to ngc1399 and wider further away ( @xmath17 for distances smaller than @xmath18 and @xmath19 for larger distances ) .",
    "typically 3 to 11 sky spectra were averaged and subtracted from the object spectra .",
    "the quality of the subtraction was judged by examining the residuals around the bright sky lines in the red .",
    "this procedure resulted in good sky subtracted spectra as long as wavelengths longer than 4000  are considered . for shorter wavelengths the uncertainties in sensitivity ( `` flat - field uncertainties '' ) between sky and object spectra",
    "make the sky subtraction difficult .",
    "however , due to the low signal - to - noise of the spectra blue - wards of 4000  this uncertainty is anyway not important .",
    "some example spectra around t1=21 are shown in fig.[fig : spec_example ]",
    "we determined velocities with two different techniques : first by using the correlation with an object of known velocity and second by measuring the redshift of an object directly with identified absorption lines .",
    "the line measurements were performed with the help of the _ rvidlines _ task within iraf .",
    "typically , around 15 features have been fitted for the velocity determinations .    for the correlation technique we used the task _ fxcor _ implemented in iraf ( the technique is described by tonry&davis @xcite ) .",
    "we did not utilize any fourier filtering but we rather smoothed very noisy spectra with a median filter ( 3 pixels ) .",
    "the continuum has been subtracted by _ fxcor _ with a spline - fit to the spectra and a @xmath20 clipping algorithm around the fit line .",
    "the range that has been proven to be best suited for the velocity determination is 4500  to 5500 .",
    "however , for fainter objects we adjusted the range individually to find the most significant correlation peak . as template , we used a high s / n - spectrum ( s / n about 40 ) of ngc1396 , a small galaxy with low intrinsic velocity dispersion and a spectrum similar to that of a cluster .",
    "this object is on mask#82 , which accordingly served as the reference mask .",
    "zero - point differences with the other masks had been accounted for by using the position of the sky oi - line .",
    "we determined ngc1396 s velocity by measuring lines and obtained @xmath21km / sec as the heliocentric velocity .",
    "this value is considerably lower than most older values from the literature : dacosta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found @xmath22km / sec and in the rc3 catalogue @xmath23km / sec is given ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "however , drinkwater et al . ( @xcite ) quote @xmath24km / s .",
    "the mean velocity of all clusters is 1438@xmath2515 km / s . as for ngc 1399 itself ,",
    "one finds 9 measurements of its radial velocity with quoted uncertainties consulting the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "after skipping two of them ( one has a discrepant value and the other a large uncertainty of 200 km / s ) , the weighted mean value is 1442@xmath259 km / s .",
    "our mean radial velocity of the entire cluster sample is 1438@xmath2515 km / s , so we are confident of our absolute velocity calibration .      the differences between cluster velocities that were derived with individual line and with correlation measurements ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : error1 ] ) can be used to study the velocity uncertainties .",
    "a dependence of the differences on the brightness of the objects is expected and can be observed .",
    "however , deviations as large as 500km / sec are more than 3-@xmath26 larger than what is expected from the measurement uncertainties .",
    "this indicates that at least for some measurements systematic errors dominate over statistical errors .",
    "we will show later that errors in the line measurements of noisy spectra are responsible for this behavior .",
    "the mean value of the difference between line and correlation measurements is @xmath27km / sec . to derive the mean we excluded clusters with absolute differences larger than 500km / sec . in this case",
    "median and mean agree .",
    "the question remains whether this is a significant deviation .",
    "the absolute scale of the correlation velocities are based on the heliocentric velocity of ngc1396 , for which we give an error of 8km / sec .",
    "taking this into account the deviation from zero of the differences is @xmath28km / sec and hence well inside the given uncertainty .",
    "for mask#80 the spectra extraction and subsequent velocity determination has been done independently by two of us ( tr and bd ) and the differences for the line measurements are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : error2 ] .",
    "the standard deviation between the two measurements is @xmath29km / sec while we expect @xmath30km / sec from the line measurement errors .",
    "the scatter reflects the uncertainty resulting from independent treatment ( tracing , aperture definition , wavelength calibration , line identification ) of the data .",
    "the best estimation of the uncertainties is a comparison of measurements that are obtained on different masks , which has been done for 31 point sources ( 29 clusters and two stars ) .",
    "the differences between the velocities are plotted in fig.[fig : error3 ] , in dependence on brightness and color .",
    "the scatter of the velocities measured via correlation is 57km / sec and in very good agreement with the expectation from the individual uncertainties ( 52km / sec ) , which shows that the given uncertainties are correct .",
    "the scatter of the velocities based on direct line measurements is 79km / sec and much larger than expected from the individual errors ( 40km / sec ) .",
    "this indicates that the errors of the line measurements are dominated by systematic errors and are not of a statistical nature .",
    "the reason for the systematic errors is most probably line misidentification in noisy spectra .",
    "line misidentification in noisy spectra also accounts for small velocity uncertainties at relatively faint clusters .    summarizing",
    ", we suggest to use the correlation velocities for any purpose , however , we provide the line measurements for a consistency check . for this reason we do not attempt to derive a more refined uncertainty estimation for the line velocities .",
    "the whole dataset is tabulated in table[tab : finaltab ] .",
    "the first column identifies the cluster : we used an identifier consisting of two 2-digit numbers , the first indicating the mask and the second the aperture number on the mask which was assigned during the extraction process .",
    "column two and three are right ascension and declination of the clusters ( j2000 ) .",
    "the positions are based on the usno2.0 catalogue ( urban et al .",
    "the color and magnitude information in columns 4 and 5 are taken from dirsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties do not include the photometric calibration errors that are 0.03 in c - t1 and 0.02 in t1 .",
    "the sixth column gives the velocity determined with the correlation measurement and the seventh column the velocity determined using direct line measurements .",
    "the uncertainties given are those returned by the respective packages used .",
    "the last column is reserved for comments .",
    "an identifier for a different cluster indicates that this cluster has been observed independently on two masks and can be identified via its number on the other mask .",
    "the spatial distribution of the whole cluster sample tabulated in tab.[tab : finaltab ] is shown in fig.[fig : cand_distr ] .",
    "color and magnitude information are missing for some clusters .",
    "the reason is the incomplete coverage of the field due to the undithered gaps in the mosaic image or that they are located within saturated regions caused by bright nearby objects .",
    "these candidates had been selected  by eye ",
    "after all object slits on the mask had been set as described above .",
    "the velocity given is the mean value of the two correlation measurements and the error a simple mean error .",
    "we quote the mean velocity only for the first appearance of the cluster in the list .",
    "the color and magnitude dependence of the correlation velocities are shown in fig.[fig : velo_rela ] .",
    "the dynamical interpretation is given in paperii .",
    "stars in our sample for which velocities have been determined are tabulated in table4 . in some cases no correlation velocities are given , only line velocities .",
    "the reason is that our template is not particularly suited to be correlated with late - type stars , which also explains the systematically larger uncertainties in the correlation velocities .",
    "globular clusters around ngc 1399 have been spectroscopically observed earlier .",
    "the largest sample , containing 47 globular cluster velocities , has been obtained by grillmair et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the anglo - australian telescope with the low - dispersion survey spectrograph with @xmath31  resolution , which resulted in a velocity uncertainty of approximately 150km / sec .",
    "better velocities with uncertainties of approximately 100km / sec have been measured for 18 clusters by minniti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) with the eso multi - mode instrument at the eso new technology telescope with a resolution of 7.5 .",
    "the observations done by kissler - patig et al .",
    "( @xcite ) with the low resolution imaging spectrograph at keck ( resolution of 5.6 ) yielded the best velocities so far for , 18 globulars with uncertainties around 35km / sec",
    ". some of these globular clusters were observed in our run as well and in tab.[tab : litcomp ] our velocities are compared with the velocities determined in the earlier studies . in addition we compiled stars that were observed in our run and are also present in the two degree field ( 2df ) survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the mean difference and standard deviation between our velocities and those of kissler - patig et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( we always subtract the reference velocity from ours ) is + 101 km / sec and 58 km / sec , respectively . from the published uncertainties we would expect a standard deviation of approximately 60 km / sec , which agrees well . from the grillmair",
    "( @xcite ) data we find for the mean difference and standard deviation -293km / sec and 153km / sec , respectively .",
    "this large difference is driven mainly by a few extremely deviating objects , probably caused by the low s / n of grillmair et al.s spectra . however , also in this case the observed and expected standard deviations are in good agreement . regarding the stars in common with the 2df survey",
    ", we find a difference of -56km / sec with a standard deviation of 83km / sec , while we would expect a standard deviation of 61km / sec .",
    "the reason for the slight discrepancy probably is that we used line instead of correlation velocities for the stars and we have shown earlier that the errors for the velocities obtained via line measurements is underestimated .",
    "these measurements are hence in good agreement with our velocities .",
