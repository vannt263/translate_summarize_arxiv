    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) so far withstood all experimental challenges and is tested as a quantum field theory at the 0.1% level  @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism of mass generation in the sm predicts the existence of a higgs boson which , so far , has eluded direct observation .",
    "direct searches at lep2 give a 95% confidence - level lower bound on the mass of the sm higgs boson of @xmath2  gev  @xcite .",
    "indirect information on the mass of the higgs boson can be extracted from the @xmath3 dependence of radiative corrections to the w boson mass . with the present knowledge of the w boson and top quark masses , and the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath4 , the sm higgs boson mass can be indirectly constrained to @xmath5  gev  @xcite by a global fit to all electroweak precision data .",
    "future more precise measurements of the w boson and top quark masses are expected to considerably improve the present indirect bound on @xmath3 :  with a precision of 27  mev ( 16  mev ) for the w boson mass , @xmath6 , and 2.7  gev ( 1.4  gev ) for the top quark mass which are target values for run  iia ( run  iib ) of the tevatron  @xcite , @xmath3 can be predicted with an uncertainty of about @xmath7 ( 25% ) .",
    "in addition , the confrontation of a precisely measured w boson mass with the indirect sm prediction from a global fit to all electroweak precision data , @xmath8  gev  @xcite , together with a precise measurement of the w width , @xmath9 , from the high transverse mass tail , will provide a stringent test of the sm .",
    "a detailed discussion of the prospects for the precision measurement of @xmath6 and @xmath9 , and of the ( leptonic ) effective weak mixing angle , @xmath10 , at run  ii and the lhc is given in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "in order to measure @xmath6 with high precision in a hadron collider environment it is necessary to fully control higher order qcd and electroweak radiative corrections to the w and z production processes .",
    "the status of the qcd corrections to w and z boson production at hadron colliders is reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we discuss the electroweak @xmath11 corrections to @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) as presented in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , concentrating on photon radiation effects and the impact of non - resonant weak corrections on the w width measurement .",
    "we illustrate the effects caused by photon radiation using z boson production as an example .",
    "the electroweak @xmath11 corrections to neutral - current drell - yan processes naturally decompose into qed and weak contributions , i.e.  they build gauge invariant subsets and thus can be discussed separately .",
    "the radiation of collinear photons off quarks requires the factorization of the arising mass singularities into the pdfs which introduces a dependence on the qed factorization scale , @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] we show the effect of the qed corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the final state lepton pair .",
    "photon radiation strongly affects the shape of the @xmath16 distribution .",
    "this is due to the mass singular terms associated with final state photon radiation , which are proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the final state lepton .",
    "+    at the z pole , the differential cross section is reduced by about 30% in the electron case and by about 20% in the muon case . below the z peak , qed corrections",
    "enhance the cross section by up to a factor  2.7 ( 1.9 ) for electrons ( muons ) .",
    "when lepton identification requirements are taken into account , the large contributions from mass singular logarithms largely cancel in the electron case because electron and photon momenta are combined for small opening angles between the two particles . for muons ,",
    "the energy of a photon which traverses the same calorimeter cell as the muon is required to be @xmath19  gev , and only the momenta of muons and photons with @xmath19  gev are combined . as a result , the mass singular logarithmic terms survive , and the effect of radiative corrections becomes more pronounced , especially at large di - lepton masses .",
    "the distortion of the shape of the breit - wigner resonance curve of the z boson due to final state photon radiation leads to a shift in the z boson mass extracted from data . in the electron channel",
    ", the shift is about 100  mev , whereas for @xmath20 one finds approximately 300  mev .",
    "since the neutrino in w decays is not observed , it is impossible to reconstruct the @xmath21 invariant mass , and the transverse mass ( @xmath22 ) distribution is frequently used to extract the mass and width of the w boson .",
    "final state photon radiation in @xmath23 affects the shape of the @xmath22 distribution in a similar way as the di - lepton invariant mass distribution in @xmath24 .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath25 and lowest order differential cross section as a function of @xmath26 with and without lepton identification requirements taken into account is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : onea ] .",
    "since neutrinos do not interact with photons , the shift in @xmath6 due to final state photon radiation is about a factor two smaller than in the z case . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the virtual radiative corrections to @xmath27 comprise resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "the non - resonant contributions , which include those originating from the @xmath28 box diagrams , vanish for @xmath29 , and thus were not included in ref .",
    "@xcite . for precision physics",
    "away from the w pole , however , the non - resonant corrections must be included .",
    "these corrections become important at large values of @xmath22 due to the presence of large sudakov - like electroweak logarithms of the form @xmath30 , which eventually may be resummed  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] we show the @xmath22 distribution including the full @xmath11 corrections normalized to the differential cross section in the effective born approximation ( eba ) at the tevatron for electron and muon final states .     +    separation cuts and lepton identification requirements to simulate the detector acceptance as described in ref .",
    "@xcite are taken into account in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] . for comparison the relative corrections including the resonant @xmath11 electroweak corrections only are also shown ( dashed line ) .",
    "as expected from the presence of large electroweak sudakov - like logarithms , the non - resonant weak corrections strongly increase in magnitude with increasing transverse masses .",
    "both , the resonant and non - resonant electroweak corrections reduce the differential cross section .",
    "the high transverse mass tail can be used for a direct measurement of the width of the w boson , @xmath9 , which in the sm is predicted to be @xmath31  gev . in run",
    "i , @xmath9 has been been measured by cdf and d  with a combined uncertainty of 105  mev from the @xmath22 tail  @xcite . in run",
    "iia , with an integrated luminosity of 2  fb@xmath32 , one expects to achieve a precision of 50  mev per lepton channel and experiment  @xcite . in order to determine how non - resonant electroweak corrections affect the w width extracted from the tail of the transverse mass distribution",
    ", it is useful to consider the ratio of the normalized @xmath22 distribution for an arbitrary w width to the normalized @xmath22 distribution with sm w width , @xmath33\\over \\left[d\\sigma(sm)/dm_t\\right]}~{\\sigma(sm ) \\over\\sigma(\\gamma_w)}\\ ] ] when resonant @xmath11 corrections only are taken into account .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath34 is shown for @xmath37 at the tevatron in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "the dashed , dotted and dash - dotted curves represent the predictions for @xmath38  gev , 2.042  gev and 2.052  gev , respectively .",
    "the solid line shows the result if , instead of a non - standard w width and resonant corrections , the full @xmath11 electroweak corrections with @xmath31  gev are used .",
    "the error bars represent the expected statistical uncertainties for 2  fb@xmath32 .",
    "experimental lepton identification criteria and detector resolution effects are taken into account in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] shows that both , non - resonant electroweak corrections and a w width smaller than that predicted in the sm , lead to similar effects in the tail of the @xmath22 distribution .",
    "this effect sets on gradually in case of the non - resonant corrections . for a non - standard w width in contrast",
    ", the ratio drops rapidly above the w pole position , and becomes constant for @xmath39  gev .",
    "since the experimental precision in the tail of the @xmath22 distribution quickly decreases with increasing values of the transverse mass , one concludes that non - resonant electroweak corrections , if ignored in the experimental determination of the w width from the high @xmath22 tail , would shift the extracted value of @xmath9 by about @xmath40  mev .",
    "calculations of the full @xmath11 electroweak corrections to w and z boson production in hadronic collisions are now available .",
    "our results show that , for future precision measurements the full electroweak @xmath11 corrections and probably also multiple photon radiation effects should be taken into account .",
    "the calculation of the non - resonant @xmath11 corrections to w production has recently been completed  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a first step towards a calculation of the @xmath41 qed corrections , the effects of two - photon radiation in w and z boson production at hadron colliders have been computed in ref .",
