    "one key step to the calibration of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) is the calibration of the acquisition images from the red peak - up ( pu ) sub - array on the short - low module ( sl ) . our primary standards , hr  6348 , hd  166780 , and hd  173511",
    "were observed repeatedly during the cryogenic _",
    "mission , and most of those observations began with target acquisition in the red pu array .",
    "we can use these data to lock the overall photometry from these standards , and use that to photometrically calibrate their spectra .",
    "to determine the effective wavelength of the red pu filter , we multiply its responsivity ( at a bias voltage of 2.0 volts ) by @xmath0 , which approximates the long - wavelength behavior of a star .",
    "the centroid of the product is 22.35  , which we will adopt for the effective wavelength of the red pu sub - array .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the process .",
    "we calibrate the red pu data by tying our photometry to the calibration of the 24-  filter on the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; engelbracht et al .",
    "2007 , rieke et al .  2008 ) .",
    "mips-24 observed all three of our primary standards .",
    "our procedure is to preserve the mean of the mips-24 measurements , but to adjust the relative levels of the individual stars to reflect their brightnesses as observed in the red pu images .",
    "our photometry follows the same procedure as described in irs - tr  11001 ( sloan & ludovici 2011 ) .",
    "pu data were obtained in two sets of three images . for each set , we produced a median image , then performed aperture photometry using a four - pixel source radius and a seven - pixel radius for the sky annulus . in cases",
    "where the photometry from the initial ( acquisition ) image differed from the second ( sweet - spot ) image by more than 1.5% , we rejected the initial image from further consideration .",
    "data obtained after irs campaign 14 have been corrected for the small variations in responsivity described in irs - tr  1101 , using divisive corrections of 0.9826 ( camp .",
    "1534 ) and 0.9929 ( camp .",
