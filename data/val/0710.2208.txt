    "the study of generic rank two subbundles in the tangent bundles of five  dimensional manifolds goes back to elie cartan s famous `` five variables paper '' @xcite from 1910 .",
    "this paper is remarkable in several respects .",
    "first , by constructing a canonical cartan connection associated to such distributions , cartan showed that they have non  trivial local invariants .",
    "second , for the simplest instance of such a distribution , cartan showed that the infinitesimal symmetries form an exceptional simple lie algebra of type @xmath1 .",
    "this was the first instance of an exceptional simple lie algebra showing up `` in real life '' .    in modern terminology ,",
    "the homogeneous model of generic rank two distributions in dimension five is the quotient of the split real form of an exceptional lie group @xmath2 of type @xmath1 by a maximal parabolic subgroup @xmath3 .",
    "an explicit description of this homogeneous space and its generic rank two distribution can be found in @xcite .",
    "cartan s construction associates to an arbitrary generic rank two distribution on a five ",
    "manifold @xmath0 a cartan geometry of type @xmath4 .",
    "in pioneering work culminating in @xcite , n.  tanaka showed that cartan geometries modelled on the quotient of a semisimple group by a parabolic subgroup are ( under small restrictions , which have later been eliminated ) equivalent to simpler underlying geometric structures .",
    "these geometric structures have been intensively studied during the last years under the name `` parabolic geometries '' .",
    "the description of the structures equivalent to parabolic geometries is best phrased in terms of filtered manifolds , an up to date version can be found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , for many geometries this underlying structure is only a filtration of the tangent bundle of a manifold with certain properties , see @xcite . in the special case of the split real form of @xmath1 with the appropriate parabolic subgroup ,",
    "this recovers cartan s result .    for generic rank",
    "two distributions in dimension five , progress was made recently by p.  nurowski in @xcite . using the canonical cartan connection associated to a distribution @xmath5 on @xmath0 , nurowski constructed a canonical conformal structure of signature @xmath6 on @xmath0 . rather than a rank two distribution ,",
    "nurowski s starting point was an underdetermined system of odes of certain type , which can be equivalently described by a generic distribution .",
    "the system of odes is determined by a single smooth function , and in his article nurowski gives an impressive ( and frightening ) formula for a metric in the conformal class in terms of this function .",
    "it was soon realized , see @xcite , that nurowski s construction can be interpreted as an analog of the fefferman construction , which to a non  degenerate cr  manifold of hypersurface type associates a canonical conformal structure on the total space of a circle bundle .",
    "the main point in this analogy is not that a conformal structure occurs in both cases , but the interpretation of the construction in terms of cartan connections . in terms of this analogy ,",
    "nurowski s construction corresponds to the version of the fefferman construction based on cartan connections , which was developed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a description of nurowski s conformal class which is analogous to j.  lee s description of the fefferman construction , see @xcite . in section",
    "[ 2 ] , we introduce the notion of a generalized contact form for a generic rank two distribution @xmath5 on a five  manifold @xmath0 .",
    "starting from such a form @xmath7 we explicitly construct a pseudo  riemannian metric @xmath8 of signature @xmath6 on @xmath0 .",
    "then we prove that another choice of generalized contact form leads to a conformally related metric , so the conformal class @xmath9 $ ] is intrinsic to the distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the formula for @xmath8 in terms of data derived from @xmath7 is rather simple and explicit , and requires no knowledge of the canonical cartan connection .    in section",
    "[ 3 ] we show that our conformal structure coincides with the one constructed by nurowski .",
    "this is based on the theory of weyl ",
    "structures for parabolic geometries , which interprets the canonical cartan connection in terms of underlying data .",
    "this also explains how the formula for the metric @xmath8 was actually found .",
    "the developments in section [ 3 ] are also interesting from the point of view of the general theory of parabolic geometries , since this is the first time that essential parts of a weyl structure are explicitly computed for one of the more involved parabolic geometries .",
    "this article is based on results obtained during the work on the second author s phd thesis , which will contain a complete description of this weyl structure .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the notion of a generalized contact form for a generic rank two distribution @xmath5 on a smooth manifold @xmath0 of dimension five . given a generalized contact form @xmath7 , we construct a pseudo  riemannian metric @xmath8 on @xmath0 .",
