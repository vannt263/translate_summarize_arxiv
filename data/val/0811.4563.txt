    "how does vibrational energy travel in molecules ? answering this question succinctly seems a hopeless task considering the complexity of interatomic interactions in a molecule . yet",
    "even before scientists were burdened by this knowledge , the so - called statistical theories posited the answer : vibrational energy travels `` very fast '' and distributes itself statistically among the vibrational modes of a molecule , assumed to resemble an assembly of coupled oscillators , well before a reaction takes place .",
    "reaction rate theories based on these assumptions  known collectively as statistical or rrkm theories  @xcite  remain reliable working tools of the practicing chemist because they have been vindicated in an overwhelming number of chemical reactions .",
    "however , numerical studies of hamiltonian systems have provided solid evidence  @xcite that the approach to equilibrium usually proceeds more slowly than predicted by statistical theories  @xcite     and it is also nonuniform , showing intriguing fits and starts . in particular , for hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom , the familiar picture of chaotic seas , rigid boundaries in terms of noble tori  @xcite , leaky barriers in terms of cantori  @xcite has been well - established in the literature , and these structures are found to be the source of anomalous transport in such systems  @xcite .    beyond two degrees of freedom ,",
    "the transport picture in terms of phase space structures is less clear .",
    "however , the phase space of higher - dimensional systems shows similar features such as the abundance of periodic orbits , and a mixture of chaotic and regular regions , the latter being characterized ( under some hypothesis ) by invariant tori of various dimensions . the kam theorem  @xcite states that these structures are in general robust with respect to an increase of the perturbation or equivalently to an increase of energy . understanding transport properties has to rely on these robust structures which are encountered by any typical trajectory . roughly speaking",
    ", the presence of so many periodic orbits explains why generic trajectories , even when the system is strongly chaotic , display long intervals of near - regular behavior alternating with fits of chaos  a hallmark of anomalous diffusion .",
    "the slow approach to equilibrium started to be acknowledged a little over fifty years ago with the investigation of the dynamics of coupled oscillators by fermi , pasta and ulam who showed that the relaxation problem is far more complex than anticipated  @xcite .",
    "in chemical physics , anomalous diffusion was first implicated in the intramolecular vibrational energy relaxation of the carbonyl sulfide ocs molecule  @xcite .",
    "the numerical study of a classical hamiltonian model of ocs shows very slow energy redistribution among the vibrational modes , even in the fully chaotic regime  @xcite , disagreeing strongly with the fast timescales derived from traditional statistical theory .",
    "the understanding of the dynamics was successfully achieved for a collinear model of ocs which has two degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "however , severe technical difficulties  @xcite have prevented such a level of understanding beyond two degrees of freedom , and in particular , for the planar ocs model , in which the molecule is allowed to bend .    in this paper , we analyze the dynamics of a model for the planar ocs which is a hamiltonian system with three strongly coupled degrees of freedom .",
    "the aim is to identify the relevant structures in phase space which are responsible for trappings and escapes , strongly influencing the transport properties ( most prominently , the redistribution of intramolecular energy among the three modes ) .",
    "for example , rapid diffusion through phase space takes place through the so - called accelerator modes  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , sticky structures  @xcite like resonant islands or tori influence the dynamics by strongly slowing down the trajectories passing nearby .",
    "all these structures are responsible for anomalous diffusion and fractal kinetics in the system ( for recent surveys , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . identifying these structures and the mechanisms behind trapping ,",
    "escape and roaming is essential for understanding the transport properties of a given system . given that there are many such structures in a realistic system , the only realistic hope for forming a generally valid picture of transport is to locate invariant structures which are responsible for the main changes in the transport properties .",
    "the specific question we address is : what are the structures in the phase space of ocs acting as dynamical bottlenecks to the diffusion of chaotic trajectories ?",
    "what are the structures allowing transitions to other parts of phase space ? for three degree of freedom systems , these invariant structures can be invariant tori with dimensions zero ( stagnation points ) , one ( periodic orbits ) , two or three  @xcite .",
    "they can also include the stable and unstable manifolds of these objects  @xcite .",
    "how are invariant structures relevant in the phenomena of capture in chaotic systems ?",
    "for planar ocs , we find that the bottlenecks and the transition mechanisms from trapped to hyperbolic behavior are provided by a particular class of two - dimensional tori and their unstable manifolds .",
    "these results were recently announced in a letter  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : known ] , we briefly recall some basics of the hamiltonian model for the planar rotationless ocs molecule . we also summarize the main results obtained on the dynamics of ocs relevant to the transport properties ( both in the planar and collinear cases ) . in sec .",

    "the striking common feature exhibited by many trajectories support the idea of some kind of universal transition mechanism . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasespace ] , after summarizing our methodology , we investigate the neighboring phase space structures which strongly influence the dynamics of these trajectories .",

    "the dynamics in the collinear configuration of ocs was first studied by carter and brumer  @xcite .",
    "they characterized the motion of this system at a number of energies , extending up to @xmath43 ( which amounts to @xmath44 a.u . ) a relaxation time , as defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , was estimated at @xmath45 pico - seconds .",
    "however , after integrating trajectories for @xmath46 picoseconds , no relaxation to statistical equilibrium was observed .",
    "when this contradiction was investigated by integrating the equations for much longer times ( up to @xmath47 picoseconds ) , two distinct timescales for relaxation were found , the longer of which characterized energy redistribution that was incomplete even after @xmath47 picoseconds  @xcite . even on the picosecond time scale , sudden transitions between relatively long - lived regions of localized mode energies were observed . since this collinear model has two degrees of freedom , davis and wagner  @xcite used poincar surfaces of section as a visualizing tool for phase space structures .",
    "these revealed that even at high energy ( @xmath44 ) , the system has a `` divided phase space '' , with coexisting regular and chaotic regions .",
    "they observed that trajectories can be trapped in restricted regions of phase space for many vibrational periods , after which they would suddenly move to other regions of phase space to repeat the pattern .",
    "progress came with the recognition that the then - recent lobe dynamics  @xcite could help to explain non - statistical relaxation in two degree of freedom systems  @xcite .",
    "when the strength of the perturbation ( or equivalently , the total energy ) is increased , the two - dimensional invariant tori of a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom develop sets of `` holes '' with the systematics of cantor sets .",
    "these holes , dubbed `` cantori ''  @xcite , form leaky barriers which can act as bottlenecks to phase space transport .",
    "these bottlenecks are associated with broken tori with irrational frequency ratios , where those with `` noble '' number ratios being generically the very last to be destroyed by an increasing perturbation ( the supporting argument being that these numbers are the most poorly approximated by rationals  @xcite ) . for ocs , their existence has been confirmed in ref .",

    "the noblest irrational number between the rationals @xmath50 and @xmath51 is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the golden mean  @xcite and can be expressed as a continued fraction of an infinite sequence of ones , also written as @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "these results obtained from classical mechanical were confirmed using quantal wave packet calculation  @xcite .",
    "however , these successful results could not be extended to the planar ocs due to severe technical and computational difficulties  @xcite .",
    "yet there were indications that this problem of intramolecular energy flow in higher dimensions is also related to the resonant and non - resonant structures  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the relevance of arnold s web in the diffusion of trajectories was highlighted . among their conclusions",
    "are that transport is most rapid along low order resonance zones ; transport is slow ( diffusive ) along high order resonances ; it was conjectured that pairwise noble frequency ratios play a role of inhibiting transport along resonance lines .",
    "the complexity of transport processes in the collinear ocs model , revealed in the early investigations , suggests that a look into phase space structures such as periodic orbits or invariant tori is needed for a better understanding of these processes .",
    "even if the measure of such invariant structures embedded into a chaotic sea is typically zero , the `` neighborhoods '' of influence around them can have relatively large measure and their finite - time properties , as characterized by lyapunov exponents , provide a quantitative picture of transport .",
    "the rationale goes as follows  : an ensemble of trajectories , described by a density function , which is centered in a finite volume around a periodic orbit , will evolve in finite time following this periodic orbit , and spreading predominantly in the direction of unstable manifolds , exponentially in time with a rate equal to the local lyapunov exponent .",
    "an orbit in the `` neighborhood '' of a periodic orbit , temporarily assumes or `` shadows '' the properties of this periodic orbit as a general consequence of dynamical continuity  @xcite .",
    "this temporary influence of periodic orbits can also be viewed as instantaneous time - periodic forcing , exerted by a periodic orbit .",
    "it is expected that , in general , typical trajectories are trapped for longer times in the neighborhoods of linearly stable orbits . in",
    "what follows , we draw a dynamical picture of transport in ocs based on the determination of invariant structures in phase space and their linear stability properties .",
