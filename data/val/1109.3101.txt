    "a quantitative understanding of the dynamics in concentrated solutions of interacting proteins is of importance to the evaluation of cellular functions , and the improvement of drug delivery .",
    "transport properties such as collective and self - diffusion coefficients , and the static and high - frequency shear viscosities , are strongly affected by the aqueous environment  @xcite , and in particular by crowding effects due to high concentration of macromolecules , coupled both by direct and solvent - mediated , hydrodynamic interactions ( his )  @xcite . the latter type of interaction , which is both long - ranged and of many - body nature",
    ", poses a particularly challenging task to a theoretical treatment of diffusion and rheological transport properties .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on a combined experimental and theoretical study on collective diffusion , low shear - rate static viscosity , and static and dynamic scattering functions of concentrated solutions of bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) proteins .",
    "the goal of this study is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "we explore how far a simple colloidal model in combination with state - of - the - art theoretical schemes can capture the microstructure and dynamics of proteins in solution . on the other hand , we investigate the concentration- and salt - dependence of collective diffusion and the static shear viscosity , and use our results to test the validity range of a generalized stokes - einstein ( gse ) relation which combines the collective diffusion coefficient with the isothermal osmotic compressibility and the shear viscosity .",
    "bsa is a protein which is readily soluble in water and stable over a wide range of salt and protein concentrations .",
    "its stability and reproducibility make it well - suited as a model system of globular proteins .",
    "proteins constitute identical solute units surpassing any synthetic colloid suspension in terms of monodispersity . in this respect",
    ", they are ideally suited to the application of analytical theoretical models used with good success for large colloids . however , the construction of a quantitatively accurate theoretical model for protein solutions is considerably obstructed not only by the potential presence of impurities and oligomers , but also by the complex internal conformation and surface of a protein .",
    "the folding state depends on various control parameters such as temperature , protein concentration , ph value , and salinity .",
    "the irregular protein surface implies an orientation - dependent protein interaction energy with repulsive and attractive parts , and furthermore complicates the description of hydroynamically influenced transport properties .    in a first step towards calculating dynamic properties of proteins ,",
    "it is nonetheless possible to use a model of reduced complexity , with system parameters such as the ph - dependent particle charge determined from a consistent fit of theoretical expressions for the scattered intensity to the experimental static scattering functions .",
    "we use here a simple colloid model where the bsa interactions are described by the repulsive , electrostatic plus hard - core part of the isotropic derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) potential @xcite .",
    "the effect of the non - spherical shape of bsa proteins is accounted for in the static intensity calculations within the so - called translational - orientational decoupling approximation , by describing the proteins as oblate spheroids interacting by a spherically symmetric effective pair potential .    using this simplifying protein interaction model , the static structure factor , @xmath0 , entering into the static scattered intensity , is calculated as a function of wavenumber @xmath1 , by using our newly developed modified penetrating background corrected rescaled mean spherical approximation ( mpb - rmsa ) .",
    "this analytical method has been shown to be in excellent accord with numerically expensive computer simulation results for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the system parameters of the protein - interaction model , most notably the effective protein charge , are determined from adjusting the theoretically calculated static intensity , @xmath2 , to the experimental one .",
    "the consistent agreement of calculated values and small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) data for @xmath2 in a wide range of concentrations and wavenumbers indicates that left - out attractive interaction contributions are of minor importance at the considered salinities . as an independent additional check , the static light scattering ( sls )",
    "data for @xmath0 at low @xmath1 are found to be well reproduced by the theoretical fits of the saxs data .    without any further adjustment ,",
    "the analytically calculated static structure factors are used as the only input to our theoretical calculations of the collective diffusion coefficient , @xmath3 , and the low shear - rate limiting static viscosity @xmath4 . to calculate @xmath3 and the high - frequency part , @xmath5 , of the static viscosity , we use two approximate analytical schemes , namely the pairwise additive hydrodynamic interaction ( pa ) approximation , and the so - called self - part corrected @xmath6 method . as shown by two of the present authors",
    "@xcite , these two methods give results which are in general in good agreement with more elaborate stokesian dynamics simulation results for particles with yukawa - type pair interactions .    the static viscosity , @xmath7 consists of a short - time part , @xmath5 , determined solely by hydrodynamic interactions ( his ) , and a shear - stress relaxation part @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "we calculate the latter using mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , which , like the two employed short - time schemes , requires @xmath0 as the only input .",
    "our comparison with the experimental @xmath3 measured by dynamic light scattering ( dls ) , and with @xmath4 obtained from viscometry , is a stringent test for our theoretical results and for the employed isotropic interaction model , since except for the static input , no fit parameters are involved . in particular , no further adjustments of the theoretical predictions have been made on referring to the actually non - spherical shape of bsa proteins .",
    "we show that despite the simplicity of our model , most dynamic features are well reproduced by the theoretical results , to an at least semi - quantitative accuracy .",
    "in particular , both a low - concentration maximum of the reduced viscosity , and a maximum in @xmath3 at a different concentration , are well captured by the theory .    for bsa ,",
    "also the short - time self - diffusion has been recently found to be reasonably well described by a simple spheroid model  @xcite . of course",
    ", this does not imply that the complex conformation of a globular protein plays no role .",
    "the dlvo model ( even with inclusion of van der waals attraction ) is not sufficient to fully explain the rich phase behavior of proteins .",
    "for example , it has been shown that surface patchiness has an important effect on the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "also , binding of multivalent ions to the protein surface can give rise to non mean - field behaviors beyond dlvo , such as charge inversion , re - entrant condensation and liquid - liquid phase separation  @xcite .",
    "generalized stokes - einstein ( gse ) relations , which approximately relate diffusion to rheological properties in concentrated complex liquids , are an important issue in microrheological studies , since a valid gse relation allows to infer a rheological property more easily from diffusion measurements .",
    "several gse relations in colloidal dispersions of electrically neutral ( porous and non - porous ) spheres , and charged particle suspensions have been explored  @xcite .",
    "we study here a gse relation not discussed in this earlier work , which has been proposed by kholodenko and douglas  @xcite .",
    "this gse relation , which we refer to in the following as the kd - gse relation , has been used in the biophysical and soft matter community @xcite .",
    "it relates @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and to the square - root of the isothermal osmotic compressibility .",
    "we present a thorough discussion of the validity range of the kd - gse relation for bsa solutions , and for generic colloidal fluids of particles with screened coulomb interactions , for a large range of salinities . both the short - time and",
    "the long - time versions of the kd - gse relation are considered . at high salinity , where the electrostatic interaction of particles is strongly screened ,",
    "we find these two relations to become invalid at larger concentrations . at lower salinity ,",
    "the kd - gse relations are poorly satisfied even at low concentrations .",

    "bsa is a globular protein with a linear extension of about @xmath10 nm . the considered aqueous solutions of bsa with no added salt , and with monovalent added salt such as nacl , have a ph in between 5.5 and 7 . under these conditions , bsa is stable in solution , folded in its native state , and carrying a negative net charge in the range of roughly @xmath11 to @xmath12 elementary charge units ( see below for details )  @xcite .",
    "bsa was purchased from sigma ( cat .",
    "a3059 ) as a lyophilized powder , certified globulin- and protease free .",
    "the sample preparation for all experimental techniques started with the dissolution of protein powder in a solvent , and subsequent waiting until the solution was homogenized .",
    "the protein mass concentration , @xmath13 , in the solution volume , @xmath14 , is given by the bsa weight @xmath15 via @xmath16 with the specific protein volume @xmath17 ml / g  @xcite determines the self - volume of proteins upon dissolution .",
    "for small - angle x - ray scattering , deionized and degased water was used as solvent .",
    "the samples with concentrations higher than 15 mg / ml were prepared directly , while smaller concentrations were prepared from a stock solution of 18 mg / ml .",
    "the samples were filled into a plastic syringe and inserted into the capillary during the measurement .    for the viscosity measurements ,",
    "the solutions were prepared similarly using as solvent both deionized water , and solutions of nacl in deionized water .",
    "the nacl molarity is calculated from the total solution volume , including the protein self - volume .",
    "all solutions used for the viscosity experiments were further degased by a water - jet air - pump .    for our light scattering experiments , stock solutions of bsa proteins in deionized water were mixed with solutions of nacl in deionized water according to the required concentration .",
    "the nacl molarity is calculated from the total water volume .",
    "then , every sample was pressed with a plastic syringe through a hydrophilized nylon membrane filter with a pore size of @xmath18 nm ( whatman puradisc 13 ) , and transferred into a cylindrical glass scattering cell .",
    "the cell was sealed immediately with a plastic cap .",
    "the effect of the difference in nacl concentrations between light scattering and viscosity samples , arising from the slightly differing sample preparation , is negligibly small .",
    "multi - angle dynamic light scattering ( dls ) was performed at various concentrations of protein and added salt , at a temperature of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the bsa mass concentration , @xmath13 , was chosen between @xmath20 to @xmath21 mg / ml , and the concentration of added salt was @xmath22 ( no added salt ) , @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that , even in the zero added - salt case , the analysis of the scattering data discussed in sec .  [ sec : static_exp_vs_theo ] reveals a residual electrolyte concentration of a few mm , scaling roughly linear with @xmath13 ( see  [ tab : lowsalt_fitparams ] ) .",
    "this suggests a few possible sources of the residual electrolyte ions .",
    "firstly , a possible source could be the surface - released counterions of charged bsa oligomers , not contained in our monodisperse model .",
    "secondly , a salt contamination of the bsa stock , and thirdly the dissociation of acidic or alkaline surface groups off the bsa proteins can not be excluded .",
    "static light scattering ( sls ) experiments were performed on the same samples .",
    "we used a combined sls / dls device from alv ( goniometer : cgs3 , correlator : 7004/fast ) , located at the institut laue langevin in grenoble , with a minimum correlation time of @xmath25 as initial and shortest time .",
    "the hene laser was operating at wavelength @xmath26 , with an output power of @xmath27 .",
    "the accessible range for the scattering angle ( wavenumber ) was @xmath28 ( q = @xmath29 ) .",
    "moreover , the dls intensity autocorrelation function decays on a time scale much slower than the interaction time , @xmath30 , of bsa , where @xmath31 is the single protein average translational free - diffusion coefficient , and @xmath32 is an effective hydrodynamic diameter .",
    "hence , dls probes the long - time collective diffusion of bsa , in the @xmath33 limit .",
    "the normalized intensity autocorrelation function obtained from dls , @xmath34 was fitted according to the siegert relation , by the double exponential decay function @xmath35 \\right)^2 ~   + \\textrm{b},\\ ] ] with decay constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fit results were essentially the same with and without the background - correction constant @xmath40 .",
    "at all probed angles , the two decay constants are widely separated ( @xmath41 ) . the faster mode , @xmath36 , is attributed to the ( long - time ) collective diffusion coefficient , @xmath3 , of bsa monomers .",
    "the appearance of the slower mode characterized by @xmath37 , can be attributed to the slow motion of the larger impurities and oligomers .",
    "after having checked that @xmath36 is overall @xmath1-independent within the experimental resolution , it was averaged with respect to its residual scattering angle fluctuations to gain better statistics .",
    "data on @xmath37 are rather noisy in comparison to @xmath36 , and show no clear dependence on @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and on the concentration of added salt .",
    "aqueous solutions of bsa with mass concentrations between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and without added salt , were measured by small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) , at the beam line id02 of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) in grenoble , france .",
    "the standard configuration at a 2 m sample - to - detector distance , and a photon energy of 16051 ev was used .",
    "measurements were repeated several times in the flow mode and with short detection times to ensure the absence of radiation damage .",
    "the data from the ccd were processed with the standard routines available at the beam line for radially averaging the data and correcting for transmission .",
    "repeated measurements were summed up , and the solvent scattering was measured independently and subtracted from the data .",
    "additionally , two dilute samples ( at @xmath44 and @xmath45 mg / ml ) with @xmath46 of added nacl were measured for form factor fitting .",
    "the viscosity data were measured at @xmath47 c , for different concentrations of protein and added salt .",
    "the first dataset was obtained for solutions without added salt , while the second set describes systems with @xmath46 nacl .",
    "all measurements were performed at a shear rate of @xmath48 , using the suspended couette - type viscometer described in ref .",
    "the important advantage of this instrument is the possibility to collect data without errors caused by the surface shear - viscosity . a test made for @xmath49 mg / ml and @xmath18 mg / ml , without salt and for 2 m added nacl , revealed no shear - rate dependence of the viscosity for shear rates between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the precision of the viscosity measurements is approximately @xmath52 . in order to minimize systematic errors ,",
    "every measurement was repeated three times , including separate sample preparations .",
    "the viscometer directly measures the relative shear - viscosity of the solution against pure water ( for technical details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the aqueous bsa solutions without",
    "added salt discussed in this work , the relative viscosity was directly measured . for bsa solutions with",
    "added salt , this quantity was obtained as the ratio of the following two values : ( a ) the directly measured relative viscosity of the bsa solution with salt against water divided by ( b ) the directly measured relative viscosity of the salt solution ( without bsa ) against water .",
    "in the following , we discuss the spheroid model of bsa .",
    "we use this model for the form factor fitting , and in determining effective sphere diameters related to different single - particle properties .    at low protein concentration and sufficient amount of added salt ,",
    "inter - protein correlations are negligible . the scattered intensity , @xmath2 , is then solely determined by the form factor @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "crystallographic measurements @xcite have revealed a flat and roughly heart - shaped structure of albumins .",
    "the computation of single - particle properties with an account of the highly complex particle shape of biomolecules can be done by numerical simulations only and is beyond the scope of this paper @xcite .",
    "rather , the aim of the present study is to give an essentially analytic description of the microstructure and the dynamics of interacting bsa proteins with low computational cost .",
    "we therefore intentionally choose an extremely simple model for the fit of the protein form factor , by an oblate , solid ellipsoid ( spheroid ) .",
    "clearly , this mapping of the complex protein configuration onto an essential geometric shape is a delicate and broad topic on its own . considering that the focus of the present work is on collective correlations rather than on single - particle properties",

    "when protein correlations come into play at higher concentrations or lower salinities , the spheroid model of bsa becomes too complex for an analytic treatment .",

    "[ fig : visc_vs_conc_exp_theo ] .",
    "the reason for this is the enhanced electrostatic screening , causing @xmath8 to decrease with increasing salinity in going from strongly structured , charged spheres to basically neutral hard spheres . in contrast , @xmath5 is known from theory and experiment @xcite to _ increase _ upon the addition of salt , due to the enlarged influence of near - field his when the particles are allowed to get closer to each other in electrostatically screened systems .",
    "thus , @xmath5 and @xmath8 have opposite trends in their dependencies on the concentration of added salt .",
