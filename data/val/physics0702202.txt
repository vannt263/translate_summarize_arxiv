    "during the last few years there has been a lot of activity in the study of networks @xcite once it was realised that networks of diverse nature exhibit many common features in their underlying structure .",
    "the most important property that appeared to be commonly occurring in such networks is the small world property .",
    "this means that if any two nodes in the network is separated by an average number of @xmath8 steps , then @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is the total number of nodes in the network . in some networks , even slower variation ( i.e. , sub - logarithmic )",
    "scaling has been observed @xcite .",
    "the first indication that networks have small world behaviour emerged from an experimental study by milgram @xcite , in which it was shown that any two persons ( in the usa ) can be connected by an average number of six steps . following the tremendous interest in the study of networks",
    ", a new experiment has been done to verify this property in real social networks @xcite . some studies which involve simulations on real networks",
    "@xcite have been made also .",
    "parallely , the question of navigation on small world networks has been addressed theoretically in many model networks @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that it is not necessary that a navigation or searching on a small world network would show the small world property , i.e. , the dynamic paths @xmath1 may not scale as @xmath10 .",
    "this is because searching is done using local information only while the average shortest distances are calculated using the global knowledge of the network .",
    "this was explicitly shown by kleinberg @xcite in a theoretical study where nodes where placed on a two dimensional euclidean space .",
    "each node here has connections to its nearest neighbours as well as to neighbours at a distance @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 .",
    "although the network is globally a small world for a range of values of @xmath13 , navigation on such networks using greedy algorithm showed a small world behaviour only at @xmath14 .",
    "in general the path length showed a sublinear power law increase with @xmath4 .",
    "recently , the scale - free property of networks has also been found in many real - world networks which precisely means that the degree distribution follows a behaviour @xmath15 , with the value of @xmath16 between 2 and 3 for most networks .",
    "navigation on such networks has also been theoretically studied yielding the result that rather than logarithmic , there is a power - law variation of the path lengths with @xmath4 as in the non - scale free euclidean network ( except for particular algorithms or values of @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "this confirms once again that for navigation in a small world network , it is not necessary that the path lengths will reflect the small world behaviour .",
    "obviously , a lot depends on the algorithm also , but any realistic algorithm is basically local . for euclidean networks , the greedy algorithm appears to be the most popular one from the findings of the original milgram experiment as well as that of @xcite . here ,",
    "once the source and the target nodes are chosen , the strategy is to connect to a neighbour closest to the target . in scale - free barabsi - albert ( ba ) networks",
    "@xcite , the two extreme strategies of a random search and highest degree search have been used as well as a preferential search scheme based on the degree @xcite . strategies involving other properties like betweenness centrality etc .",
    "have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "a relevant question in this context is how to test the quality of the search strategy . noting that the path lengths in all the studies show a behaviour @xmath17",
    ", one may expect that a lower value of @xmath18 indicates a better search strategy .    in realistic searches as in milgram s experiments and that described in @xcite , the search may not be successful or complete always .",
    "( in fact for graphs which are not fully connected , there is always a finite possibility that a connected path does not exist , even with global knowledge @xcite . ) here , apart from the search length , the success rate is also an important factor . indeed , most works referring to milgram s experiments ignore the fact that very few chains were completed in the initial experiment ( 3 out of 60 ) and better success rate ( 35% or more ) was achieved only after randomness in the search was compromised in the sense that the choice of the source persons was made with some bias @xcite .",
    "many of the theoretical models do not consider the probability of termination at all and the interest is to find out whatever the search length is .",
    "we argue that for realistic searches , where termination of search paths is a possibility , one must consider both the success rate as well as the path lengths to adjudge the quality of a search strategy .",
    "we have generated random scale free networks and used a tunable preferential search strategy which can be extended from a random search ( rs ) to a highest degree search ( hds ) scheme .",
    "in general we find that @xmath2 , the success rate also follows a power law behaviour such that @xmath19 . on a scale - free network",
    ", it is expected that a high degree search will improve the search quality .",
    "however , we have shown that a comparison of search strategies based on the behaviour of path lengths alone may lead to an entirely different conclusion .",
    "on the other hand , we find that the ratio of the success rate to the path length , @xmath0 has a power law behaviour with @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 decreases as one conducts a higher degree search ( section ii ) .",
    "we therefore claim that @xmath3 is a reliable measure to test the quality of a realistic search on a network involving both the success rate and the shortest path lengths in an effective manner .",
    "calculation of @xmath3 on simple networks suggests that @xmath21 can take up values between zero and one ( section iii ) .",
    "corresponding to @xmath22 we have the best searchability ; this we call a `` dynamical small world '' ( dsw ) effect . in section iv",
    ", we have shown that @xmath3 is indeed sensitive to the distinguishing features of networks using the examples of different kinds of scale - free networks with the same degree exponent @xmath16 .",
    "finally , in section v we have considered a social network in which the nodes possess a `` similarity '' factor and the the linking probability of two nodes depends parametrically on it . here , we have shown that it is possible to obtain dsw ( i.e. , @xmath21 assumes values very close to zero ) for a finite range of values of the parameter .",
    "in this section we describe the searching procedure on random scale - free ( rsf ) networks , which have no other features other than being scale - free .",
    "random scale - free networks are generated by assigning the degree to each node following a scale - free distribution @xmath15 , allowing @xmath23 to vary from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath25 is taken to be @xmath26 while @xmath24 is allowed to vary from 1 to higher values .",
    "the links are then established randomly between the nodes with the given distribution .",
    "links are assigned in steps ; we start with the node with the highest degree , in the next step the node with the second highest degree and so on .",
    "this method has been previously used to generate random scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "the search strategy is like this : + a source node and a target node are selected randomly .",
    "the source node will send the signal to one of its neighbouring nodes provided that node has not already taken part in the search .",
    "this is in tune with milgram - like experiments .",
    "-1 cm    if one of its neighbour happens to be the target itself , the message will be send to the target . if not , then the @xmath27 neighbour will receive the message with a probability @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the degree of the @xmath31th node .",
    "this continues and if it happens that the message can not be passed any more , the chain will remain incomplete .",
    "we take the average dynamic shortest path as the average of all completed chain lengths .",
    "obviously @xmath32 corresponds to a random search while @xmath33 gives rise to the highest degree search .",
    "@xmath34 were considered for the ba network in @xcite , although the algorithm was slightly different .",
    "we first report the results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath35 for a network of @xmath36 nodes with different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the path length against @xmath37 shows a very interesting result .",
    "normally one would expect that the path length will reduce with higher degree searches . while this happens for @xmath38 3 or 4 , for smaller values of @xmath24",
    ", this is not true . here ,",
    "on the contrary , the path length increases with @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "for all values of @xmath24 , we notice that the path lengths saturate to a constant value which corresponds to the highest degree search .",
    "this occurs for finite values of @xmath39 .",
    "the fraction of successful attempts @xmath2 shows a uniform behaviour with @xmath37 ; for all values of @xmath24 , it increases with @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "1b ) as expected .",
    "the reason why for small @xmath24 there is a difference in behaviour of @xmath1 is quite obvious .",
    "when @xmath24 is small and a random search is carried on , very few chains can be completed , but if completed , these are essentially small in length as the connectivity on an average is small . on making a higher degree search , more chains can be completed but at the expense of increased path lengths .",
    "the static small world effect is quantatively measured by the behaviour of the average shortest path lengths @xmath8 ( global ) with @xmath4 .",
    "we notice that the dynamic path lengths @xmath1 varies with @xmath37 and in all cases it shows a power law increase with @xmath4 ( except for @xmath40 and @xmath41 where it has a logarithmoc increase ) .",
    "however , for @xmath24 small , the path length against @xmath4 shows that it varies as @xmath18 with @xmath18 increasing with a higher degree search , which is counter intuitive ( fig .",
    "so clearly the path length alone is not a good measure of the searchability .",
    "the success rate , on the other hand , shows a change in behaviour as @xmath37 is varied .",
    "the exponent @xmath42 shows a decrease with @xmath37 ; for small values of @xmath37 , @xmath42 is positive and it goes on to assume negative values for higher @xmath37 .",
    "however , when we study the behaviour of the ratio @xmath0 as a function of @xmath4 , we find a consistent behaviour @xmath43 , where @xmath6 decreases as @xmath44 is increased ( fig .",
    "3a ) .    for higher values of @xmath24 , path length and success rates",
    "show expected behaviour with @xmath4 ; both improve with @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath21 also decreases with @xmath37 monotonically as in the case of @xmath45 ( fig 3b ) .",
    "hence one can regard @xmath3 as a measure to adjudge the quality of the search strategy in general . for higher values of @xmath24 ( which implies higher connectivity ) , variation of @xmath21 with @xmath37",
    "is not that appreciable showing that for networks with larger connectivity , the sensitivity to degree - based algorithm is not remarkable .",
    "the searchability factor @xmath3 and hence @xmath21 can be calculated in some simple cases .",
    "although the examples may seem too idealised , the results help us to understand the bounds of @xmath21 .",
    "search on a regular network with nearest neighbour interactions only .",
    "the simplest case is a one dimensional chain ( fig .",
    "4a ) . on any euclidean network , a greedy allgorithm , i.e.",
    ", passing the message to a node closest to the target is meaningful . here",
    "as the links are between nearest neighbours only , the search path length is equal to @xmath11 where @xmath11 is the distance separating them . in general @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the success rate is hundred percent here such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 in this case .",
    "note that in this case , since the message can not be passed to the same node more than once , the search must take a unique path , it has to be directed towards the target in steps of 1 ( shown by the arrows in fig 4a ) .",
    "thus random search is not conceivable here .",
    "if the message can be passed to the same node more than once , one can use a random search and the situation is analogous to a random walker .",
    "the path length will now be proportional to @xmath50 and the corresponding @xmath51 .",
    "this is in fact the worst case scenario : however , it does not belong to the class of navigation considered here where messages can be received only once .",
    "search on a tree with uniform branching ratio : let us imagine a tree with branching ratio @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "4b ) and with @xmath53 levels .",
    "let us consider the case of sending a message from the top ( zeroeth level ) to a node at the bottom ( @xmath53th ) level .",
    "the probability that a message is sent to this node at the @xmath53th level from the top is @xmath54 . noting that the number of nodes @xmath55 , @xmath56 implying @xmath49 here .",
    "more generalised cases where search from arbitrary sources and targets are considered may give different values of @xmath21 .",
    "for example , if one considers search paths of length 1 only , then the success rate is @xmath57 giving @xmath22 .",
    "larger paths will have a different @xmath21 and @xmath21 in principle can vary from 0 to 2 .",
    "if one takes all the possibilities , i.e. , all possible pairs of source and targets , then the average @xmath21 can be estimated from the following expression : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ratio @xmath60 for two nodes separated by @xmath61 edges and @xmath62 the number of such pairs .",
    "the terms in the numerator decrease with @xmath61 ; for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , while @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus the leading order term in the numerator is @xmath68 while the leading order term in the denominator is @xmath69 giving @xmath49 for very large trees .",
    "search on a gel - here we consider a network in the form of a gel or a star ( fig .",
    "4c ) where there is a central node to which all other nodes ( having only one link ) are attached .",
    "again path lengths are of the order 1 and success is a surity . hence @xmath70 here .",
    ". a chain of hubs or gels :    we consider a idealised chain of hubs or gels , it contains @xmath11 hubs with degree @xmath23 each ( fig .",
    "4d ) ; the total number of nodes @xmath71 .",
    "now a search path length will be of the order of @xmath11 , say @xmath72 . if we consider a random search , the probability of completing the search is @xmath73 . or",
    ", @xmath74 the thermodynamic limit @xmath75 may correspond to two different cases .",
    "the first is when @xmath11 is small but @xmath76 is finite .",
    "the search probability is small ( but non - zero ) and @xmath3 does not vary with @xmath4 ( as the ration @xmath76 remains finite ) giving @xmath77 .    on the other hand if @xmath11 is large and @xmath23 finite , @xmath78 such that @xmath3 goes exponentially to zero rather than as a power law .",
    "the above discussion shows that when @xmath79 , the value of @xmath21 for small world networks lies between @xmath80 and @xmath81 when the search is done randomly .",
    "obviously , for a more efficient algorithm @xmath21 is lesser than that for the random search and thus it can be said that for searches in which repetition of messengers is not allowed , @xmath82 .",
    "a dynamic small world in this perspective is one in which @xmath77 .    in this section ,",
    "the simple networks which have been considered have no loops and hence the paths from one node to another is unique .",
    "thus the important quantity determining @xmath3 is essentially the success rate . in the trivial cases like the linear chain and the gel",
    ", even the success rate is deterministic . on more complicated networks , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 will have to be computed probabilistically .",
    "in this section we show that our measure of searchability @xmath3 is sensitive to the distinguishing features of different networks .",
    "we have considered networks which are equivalent as far as the degree distribution is concerened in the sense they are all scale - free with the same exponent but differ in certain other aspects .",
    "we have selected scale - free networks with the same exponent @xmath83 and used a hds algorithm which is meaningful in a scale - free network . in the two subsection",
    "we give a brief desciption of the models we have considered and the results obtained .",
    "we have considered three different types of scale free models :    \\1 .",
    "the barabsi albert ( ba ) network :    the ba network is grown using a preferential attachment scheme . here , we have started with a single node and nodes are attached to the network one by one .",
    "an incoming node gets attached to the @xmath31th existing node with the probability @xmath84 where @xmath30 is the degree of the @xmath31th node at that time .",
    "this network has a has a tree structure as we allow only one link to an incoming node .",
    "the random scale free ( rsf ) network :    this network is the same as that described in section ii . we have taken @xmath83 here and kept @xmath85 such that it is comparable to the ba network .",
    "scale free assortative network ( sfa )    the third network which we have considered is a scale - free model with tunable assortativity @xcite .",
    "this scale - free assortative ( sfa ) network is generated by modifying slightly the method of generating the rsf network . to each node , the degree is assigned from a scale - free distribution as in rsf .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath86 be the degrees assigned to nodes @xmath31 and @xmath87 . while establishing the links of the @xmath31th node , attachment to the @xmath88 node will be definitely made if @xmath89 .",
    "otherwise they will be linked with a probability @xmath90 here @xmath91 controls the assortativity factor .",
    "for @xmath92 , there is no assortativity and for @xmath93 @xmath94 , the network is assortative ( disassortative ) .",
    "it may be noted that both the rsf and the ba networks have zero assortativity @xcite .",
    "we employ the hds algorithm , i.e , a node always passes on the information to the neighbour with the highest degree . in the ba network , for system sizes considered here , @xmath1 shows a power law increase with @xmath4 with an exponent @xmath95 which becomes smaller with @xmath4 showing that it approaches a logarithmic increase with @xmath4 for large @xmath4 .",
    "this is to be expected as it has a tree structure .",
    "( in @xcite it was shown that even with loops , the highest degree search scheme in the ba network results in a logarithmic increase of the path lengths with @xmath4 . )",
    "@xmath2 follows a power law decay with @xmath4 such that @xmath96 .    for the rsf network",
    ", we again apply hds and find that in this case @xmath97 , although the path length varies logarithmically with @xmath4 .",
    "( it may be mentioned here that for the rsf , as @xmath16 is increased from 2 to 3 , the searchability becomes less efficient in terms of @xmath3 and also becomes less sensitive to the factor @xmath37 . )",
    "thus in terms of simply the path lengths the rsf and ba networks are equally searchable which is counterintuitive . on the other hand @xmath3",
    "gives a more realistic result .    in the third network , even when it is weakly assortative ( @xmath98 ) , we find that @xmath21 shows a deviation from the random network value . here",
    "@xmath99 which means that it is more searchable than the rsf but less than the ba network with the same algorithm .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath3 with @xmath4 for different networks is shown in fig .",
    "as already mentioned , in the ba as well as in the rsf networks , the path length shows a logarithmic increase with @xmath4 but since @xmath21 is appreciably greater than zero , neither of these two networks is an ideal dynamic small world .",
    "the random scale - free network has a worse searchability because of the sharper decay of the success rate . in the sfa network , there is a tendency of clustering of high degree nodes thereby allowing loops .",
    "hence the path length does not scale logarithmically with @xmath4 .",
    "however , one only needs to know the behaviour of @xmath3 to comment on the searchability and here it shows a slower decay with @xmath4 compared to the rsf network although the magnitude of @xmath3 is lesser .",
    "till now we have discussed search strategies on network which are basically characterised by their degree distribution .",
    "social networks , which are found to be scale - free in many cases , have some additional features .",
    "it has been found that in a society , people have different characteristics and the links depend on these bonds .",
    "these characteristics can be related to profession , hobbies , geographical locations etc .",
    "we have considered a very simplified picture with one such characteristic which we call the similarity factor @xmath100 of the individuals varying between 0 and 1 randomly . in a scale - free network with given distribution @xmath101",
    ", we first assign the degrees as well as the similarity factors to the nodes .",
    "the bonding between two nodes , subject to this distribution is now made according to @xmath102    thus we will have a scale - free network of degree exponent @xmath16 in which similar nodes will try to link up for @xmath103 .",
    "the similarity factors @xmath104 can be looked upon as coordinates in a one dimensional lattice in which case the network is scale - free network as well as euclidean .    in the earlier cases",
    "only degree based strategies have been considered as the networks did not have any other characteristic feature .",
    "but as shown in @xcite such a strategy is rather artificial for social networks .",
    "here we have considered two different strategies ; one is the standard hds while the other one is a greedy algorithm based on the similarity factor . in the latter",
    ", a node sends the signal to a neighbour which is most similar to the destination node .",
    "we call this the highest similarity search ( hss ) .",
    "we investigate how the searching strategies are dependent on @xmath13 based on the value of @xmath21 .",
    "we consider networks with @xmath105 and @xmath106 here and vary @xmath13 to obtain networks varying on the basis of similarity based bondage between the nodes for the same degree exponent .",
    "we have shown in section iv that the measure @xmath3 is able to distinguish between networks of same degree exponent which differ in other characteristics and hence it is meaningful to employ this measure to investigate the searchability based on different algorithms here .",
    "again we find that @xmath3 shows a power law decay with @xmath4 for both strategies in general .",
    "however , for the highest degree search , the value of @xmath21 shows marginal dependence on @xmath13 and the network is moderately searchable with this strategy as @xmath21 lies between 0.5 and 0.6 . using the hss on the other hand we find an appreciable variation of @xmath21 with @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , we find that for @xmath107 , the network is highly searchable as @xmath21 is @xmath108 here . for @xmath109 , @xmath21 becomes lesser for higher @xmath4 values indicating that it might go to zero in the thermodynamic limit giving rise to a truly dynamical small world effect .",
    "it is true that not all social networks are scale - free .",
    "however , our studies lead to the important result that _ even for scale - free networks _ , if there is a social distance dependent linking scheme , the degree based search is rather inefficient ( compared to the one based on the social characteristic ) .",
    "thus we conclude that for any social network , the degree based search will be less useful .    here",
    "we have considered networks of size @xmath110 with a cutoff in the degree distribution at @xmath111 ( @xmath105 ) . in order to simulate the friendship or acquintance networks , where in principle ,",
    "the whole population of the earth is involved , it is better to use a degree distribution with an exponential cutoff or simply exponential decay to make the study more realistic @xcite .",
    "in this work we have proposed a new method to study the searchability on networks where the search may not be complete always as transmission of signals can not be repeated to the same node . in real searches ,",
    "failure to complete a chain may be due to various other reasons @xcite .",
    "the motivation comes from milgram - like experiments of searches where the success rate is really low when the source nodes are randomly selected .",
    "we first show that only the study of search path lengths as a function of the system size is not enough to determine the searchability of a network .",
    "rather , the ratio of the success rate to the path length , @xmath3 , is a more reasonable measure .",
    "we have established this by executing searches on scale - free networks but the significance of @xmath3 is by no means limited to scale - free networks only .",
    "we have shown that in general @xmath3 behaves as @xmath5 with @xmath21 showing a decrease for a better algorithm .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is indicated to be between 0 and 1 .",
    "the zero value signifies what we have termed a dynamic small world effect .    extending the study to networks in which social distances matter",
    ", we have shown that algorithms based on social distances rather than on degree tend to be more successful in general .",
    "this is again consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "here we have introduced a parameter @xmath13 which governs the similarity dependent linking probability between two nodes .",
    "we find that @xmath3 , the searchability , is maximum at @xmath112 , where @xmath21 is very close to zero .",
    "this corresponds to a network where the similarity factor controls the linkings to a moderate extent .",
    "this seems realistic ; in a society where only very similar people share links ( i.e. , @xmath13 has very large values ) the searchability can not be high .",
    "on the other hand , for low values of @xmath13 , the network is almost random , where the searchability is again not very high .",
    "our studies are motivated by the finding of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have obtained reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental observations ( specifically with that of @xcite ) as already mentioned .",
    "further comparison is not feasible for various reasons . in real experiments , several reasons for termination of the search",
    "exist giving rise to a lower success rate . also , the main emphasis of the present paper is the scaling behaviour of the relevant quantities with the system size @xmath4 , which has not been studied in these experiments .",

    "<S> we consider navigation or search schemes on networks which are realistic in the sense that not all search chains can be completed . we show that the quantity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average dynamic shortest distance and @xmath2 the success rate of completion of a search , is a consistent measure for the quality of a search strategy . </S>",
    "<S> taking the example of realistic searches on scale - free networks , we find that @xmath3 scales with the system size @xmath4 as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 decreases as the searching strategy is improved . </S>",
