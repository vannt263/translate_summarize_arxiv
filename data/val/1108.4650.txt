    "the electromagnetic field interacting with bodies gives rise to several effects , among which the radiative heat transfer @xcite and the casimir - lifshitz force @xcite .",
    "these two effects are intimately connected , and can be described by a common formalism . if a definite temperature is assigned to bodies and radiation , two main situations are possible .",
    "radiation can be at thermal equilibrium with matter everywhere : in this case the heat transfer is identically zero , whereas the casimir - lifshitz force assumes its equilibrium value . if , instead , radiation is not at thermal equilibrium with matter , both the appearance of heat transfer between the bodies and a variation of the forces acting on them occur .    in considering the phenomena of heat transfer and casimir - lifshitz forces ,",
    "the bodies shapes , geometric configurations , and dielectric functions are main issues , together with the thermal configuration of the system .",
    "a general framework used in solving such kind of problems is that of macroscopic electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "casimir - lifshitz interaction for systems at thermal equilibrium ( at @xmath0 ) has been largely studied in the last 60 years reaching a consistent and almost complete theoretical formulation , as well as experimental observation @xcite .",
    "in particular , much more recently , the thermal component of the force at thermal equilibrium has been measured @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "systems out of thermal equilibrium have been much less explored , and mainly simple configurations and idealized cases ( such as infinite bodies ) have been considered .",
    "nonetheless , systems out of thermal equilibrium showed remarkable features , already object of theoretical and experimental investigations both concerning the force @xcite and the heat transfer @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the atom - surface force , where the absence of peculiar cancellations among the different components of the radiation out of thermal equilibrium leads to large quantitative and qualitative modifications such as new asymptotic behaviors and possibility of repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "these new features have allowed the first experimental observation of thermal effects @xcite .",
    "recently , motivated by the necessity to develop a more complete theory for systems out of thermal equilibrium , several studies have been developed @xcite .",
    "in particular , a general closed - form analytic expression for both heat transfer and casimir - lifshitz interactions has been derived , valid for arbitrary bodies shapes , dielectric functions , and arbitrary temperatures of the bodies and of the environment @xcite . to this purpose",
    "a scattering - matrix approach has been used .",
    "this approach has been already successfully employed to calculate casimir - lifshitz interactions @xcite : its main advantage with respect to the standard green - function formulation , where the electromagnetic problem needs to be solved for the complete system , consists in requiring the solution for each body composing the system independently .    in this paper",
    "we provide a systematic derivation for the heat transfer and for the casimir - lifshitz force out of thermal equilibrium between two bodies at two different temperatures , immersed in and external environmental radiation characterized by another temperature @xcite .",
    "particular attention is devoted to the expression of the average values of the electromagnetic field in terms of the scattering operators .",
    "the general expression is finally analytically and numerically applied to several simple but already interesting configurations , by calculating the heat transfer and the force for slab - slab and atom - slab systems in an out of equilibrium scenario .",
    "the role of finite - size effects and of the environmental temperature are shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively relevant .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ secphyssyst ] we present the physical system , the hypotheses and the general theoretical framework . in sec .",
    "[ sect ] and [ secs ] we evaluate the analytic expression and the flux of the two main ingredients of our calculation : the maxwell stress tensor and the poynting vector . section [ srt ] is dedicated to the definition of the reflection and transmission operators associated to each body .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ fieldcorr ] the correlators of the fields emitted by the bodies and by the environment are expressed as a function of the scattering operators .",
    "this allows us to calculate , in sec .",
    "[ finalfh ] , the fluxes of the stress tensor and the poynting vector in any region and then the final expressions of the casimir - lifshitz force and the heat transfer .",
    "this expression is first applied to the case of a single body alone out of thermal equilibrium in sec .",
    "[ bodyalone ] .",
    "then , in sec",
    ". [ numappl ] , we discuss the case of the force acting on a neutral atom in front of a planar slab , as well as both the force and the heat transfer in a two - slab configuration .",
    "we finally give some conclusive remarks .",
    "let us start by describing the geometrical configuration of our physical system .",
    "we are going to deal with two bodies , labeled with 1 and 2 . from a geometrical point of view",
    "we will assume that the two bodies are separated by a planar surface .",
    "this hypothesis is not strictly necessary in a scattering - matrix approach but it is nonetheless verified in all the relevant experimental configurations such as for example two parallel planes , a sphere or a cylinder in front of a plane , two cylinders , as well as an atom in proximity of a planar surface . at the same time , this assumption allows us to choose a convenient plane - wave decomposition for the electric and magnetic fields , leading in this way to quite simple expressions of the casimir - lifshitz force and the heat transfer . to be more specific ,",
    "the geometry of our system is depicted in figure [ fig1 ] : the bodies 1 and 2 are respectively enclosed in the strips @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "any plane @xmath4 with @xmath5 separates the two bodies , and three regions a , b and c are defined .    .",
    "this defines the three regions a , b and c.,height=170 ]    our geometrical description coherently includes as a limiting case the possibility of bodies having infinite thickness , taking for example for body 1 ( body 2 ) the limit @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "as far as the thermodynamical description of our system is concerned , we will assume that we are able to define for body 1 ( 2 ) a temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and that it is in local thermal equilibrium , i.e. the temperature of each body is assumed to be constant .",
    "moreover , we assume that the two bodies are immersed in a vacuum environment ( having @xmath10 ) characterized by a third temperature @xmath11",
    ". we will make the further important assumption that the composite system is in a stationary regime , which means that the three temperatures remain constant in time .",
    "let us now first describe the general framework of the calculation .",
    "we are interested in calculating the force @xmath12 acting on any of the two bodies , as well as the heat transfer @xmath13 on it , defined as the energy it absorbs per unit of time .",
    "focusing for example on body 1 , these two quantities can be expressed under the form of surface integrals through a closed surface @xmath14 enclosing the body 1 @xmath15\\\\ h&=-\\int_{\\sigma}\\langle\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rangle_\\text{sym}\\,\\cdot d\\bbm[\\sigma]\\end{split}\\ ] ] of the quantum symmetrized average of the maxwell stress tensor @xmath16 ( having cartesian components @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ) and the poynting vector @xmath19 .",

    "it is evident that a complete description of the electric and magnetic fields in any region is mandatory .    in our coordinate system",
    "the @xmath24 axis clearly represents a privileged direction , being the axis perpendicular to the plane separating the two bodies .",
    "inspired by this property , for the mode decomposition of our electromagnetic field in any region we replace the common plane - wave representation in which a mode of the field is represented by the three - dimensional wavevector @xmath25 by a description in terms of the transverse wavevector @xmath26 and the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the result of this choice is that in this approach the @xmath24 component @xmath28 of the wavevector becomes a dependent variable , defined by the relation @xmath29 .",
    "since this relation is quadratic in @xmath28 , we are obliged to introduce explicitly a variable @xmath30 taking the values @xmath31 ( with shorthand notation @xmath32 in the expression of the polarization vectors and field amplitudes ) corresponding to the sign of @xmath28 . as a consequence , the complete wavevector will be noted with @xmath33 for @xmath34 , this relations gives a real value of @xmath28 , and then a propagative wave , for which the @xmath30 represents the direction of propagation along the @xmath24 axis . on the contrary , for @xmath35",
    ", @xmath28 becomes imaginary and we get an evanescent wave whose amplitude depends on @xmath24 : in this case @xmath30 is the direction along with the amplitude of the evanescent wave decays .",
    "moreover , we will as usual need an index @xmath36 associated to the polarization , taking the values @xmath37 corresponding to te and tm modes respectively .",

    "the @xmath87 component of the force on a given body is given by the flux @xmath88 where the summation over repeated indices is assumed and @xmath14 represents any closed _ box _ entirely enclosing the body .",

    "is given in this case by the flux of @xmath83 through the two surfaces orthogonal to the @xmath24 axis , plus the fluxes of @xmath92 and @xmath93 through the surfaces of the parallelepiped orthogonal to the @xmath49 and @xmath50 axes respectively .",
