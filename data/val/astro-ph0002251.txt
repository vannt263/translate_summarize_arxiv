    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) has become a numerical method widely used for addressing problems related to fluid flows in astrophysics . due to its lagrangian nature",
    "it is especially well suited for applications involving variations by many orders of magnitude in density .",
    "examples for this type of applications are simulations of the collapse of molecular clouds and the formation of a stellar cluster , as performed by klessen , burkert & bate  .",
    "a comparison between grid based methods and sph was performed by burkert , bate & bodenheimer   and bate & burkert  .",
    "they applied both methods to the numerically demanding problem of gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a slightly perturbed rotating cloud core with an @xmath0 density profile .",
    "both methods yielded the same qualitative results .",
    "bate   performed the first calculation which followed the collapse of a molecular cloud core in 3 dimensions down to a protostellar object in hydrodynamical equilibrium , thus spanning 17 ( ! ) orders of magnitude in density .",
    "other applications include accretion processes in massive circumbinary disks @xcite , the collapse of cloud cores induced by shock waves @xcite or colliding clumps @xcite , the precession of accretion disks in binary systems @xcite , the dynamical behaviour of massive protostellar disks @xcite or the formation of large scale structure and galaxies in the early universe @xcite .",
    "a variety of physical processes are at work in the interstellar medium , like magnetic fields , radiation or thermal conductivity , necessitating their inclusion into numerical codes .",
    "this has already been achieved to a large extent in grid based methods like the magneto - hydrodynamics codes zeus @xcite or nirvana @xcite , or codes including effects of ir and uv radiation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the addition of physical processes to sph codes is just at its beginnings .",
    "extensions achieved so far are sophisticated equations of state ( e.g. vanhala et al .",
    "1998 ) and self - gravity .",
    "some efforts were made to make sph faster and more accurate .",
    "the introduction of tree algorithms @xcite and the use of gravity pipe ( grape ) , a hardware device for fast computation of the gravitational n - body forces @xcite , helped reducing the numerical effort for the gravitational force calculation and the determination of the nearest neighbours for each particle .",
    "inutsuka   presented a godunov - like solver for the eulerian equations in sph thus enhancing the numerical treatment of shocks .",
    "the introduction of gravitational periodic boundaries  @xcite allows the treatment of fragmentation and turbulence in molecular clouds without global collapse .",
    "the timestep problem which arises during isothermal collapse calculations at high densities is circumvented by the formation of sink particles , which substitute the innermost parts of the collapsing clump by one particle and accumulate the infalling mass and momenta @xcite .",
    "the strength of sph lies in its lagrangian nature , which makes it especially attractive for problems involving gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "applications like e.g. by klessen et al .  , which deal with the collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds , neglect the feedback processes of newly born stars which act on their parental cloud through stellar winds , outflows and ionization .",
    "this simplification may be justified as long as the simulations deal with collapse on timescales smaller than @xmath1 1 myr , on which single and binary stars or t tau - like clusters are formed  @xcite .",
    "the case is different for larger timescales , on which ob subgroups and associations are formed .",
    "neglecting feedback in these cases can lead to unphysical results , like a star formation efficiency of 100 per cent , since in the purely isothermal case all material will sooner or later be accreted onto the evolving protostellar cores .",
    "this is in strong contradiction to observations , which estimate a global star formation efficiency for ordinary molecular clouds of order 10 per cent @xcite .",
    "another possible effect of feedback is the induction of star formation due to the compression of cloud material by shock waves and ionization fronts .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the implementation of the effects of ionizing uv radiation by massive stars into sph calculations as a first step in order to perform collapse calculations on scales where ob - stars are formed in a more realistic way .",
    "this will in future applications allow us to assess questions like : how does the process of ionization by massive stars change the stellar initial mass function ?",
    "what are the implications for the star formation efficiency ?",
    "can star formation be induced by ionization , and if yes , what are the time scales and the parameter space , for which induced star formation can be expected ?",
    "these questions will be discussed in subsequent papers .",
    "we incorporate the effects of ionizing radiation from hot stellar photospheres into sph by dividing the problem into three major substeps :    1 .   calculation of the uv radiation field by solving the time - independent , non - relativistic equation of radiative transfer , 2 .",
    "determination of the ionization and recombination rates from the local radiation field , density and ionization fraction , 3 .   advancing the ionization state of the particles in time by solving the time - dependent ionization rate equation .",
    "given a planar infall of ionizing photons from a distant source onto the border of the volume of interest with a flux @xmath2 lyman continuum photons per time and square area , the resulting photon flux inside this volume is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the optical depth for the ionizing photons along the line of sight parallel to the infall direction of the photons , and @xmath5 is the distance from the border of the integration volume along the line of sight :    @xmath6 { \\rm d } s^{\\prime}.\\ ] ]    we neglect the effect of ` photon hardening ' , i.e. the stronger absorption of weaker photons , and use an ` effective ' absorption coefficient @xmath7 , the mean of @xmath8 over frequency , weighted by the spectrum of the source @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the ionization cross section of hydrogen in the ground state and @xmath12 the particle density of the h atoms .",
    "the role of dust in hii regions and its effect on ionizing radiation is still very uncertain  @xcite .",
    "if dust is present , it will partially absorb uv photons , heat up and reemit the energy in the ir regime .",
    "its first order effect can be included easily under the assumption of a homogeneous distribution of the dust in the hii region . the corresponding contribution to the optical depth",
    "can be incorporated by adding the dust absorption coefficient at the lyman border @xmath13 to the absorption coefficient in eq .",
    "[ eq : los ] .",
    "@xmath13 depends on the dust model used and is regularily determined using mie theory for grains with given distributions in size and shape . in this paper",
    ", we set @xmath14 to zero throughout .",
    "we also neglect the diffuse field of lyman continuum photons , which are being produced by recombinations of electrons into the ground level and which themselves possess sufficient energy for ionizing other h atoms .",
    "a thorough treatment of this radiation can only be achieved by detailed radiation transfer calculations as proposed e.g. by yorke & kaisig  .",
    "instead we use the assumption of the validity of the ` on the spot ' approximation as follows : due to the fact that the spectrum of the lyman recombination photons as well as the the ionization cross section is strongly peaked at the lyman border , a small amount of h atoms in the ionized region is sufficient to make the medium optically thick for the lyman recombination photons .",
    "this leads to the absorption of these photons in the ultimate vicinity of their creation sites . as the creation of one photon",
    "is related to the creation of one h atom , its absorption leads to the destruction of one h atom .",
    "thus the net effect of these photons on the local ionization structure is zero .",
    "this assumption breaks down in regions next to ob stars , where due to the high uv flux the density of h atoms is not sufficient to make the medium optically thick to lyman continuum photons .",
    "next to ionization fronts , where the density of h atoms is much higher , the ` on the spot ' assumption is nevertheless a good approximation . on further details",
    "refer to yorke  .",
    "the ionization rate in the medium is given by the sinks of the uv radiation field , since every ionization leads to the absorption of one uv photon : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the flux vector in the direction @xmath17 of the line of sight .",
    "the recombination rate can be estimated as : @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the particle density of h atoms and protons together , @xmath20 the particle density of free electrons , @xmath21 the ionization fraction and @xmath22 the effective recombination coefficient under assumption of validity of the ` on the spot ' approximation .",
    "the recombination coefficient @xmath23 is given as the sum over the individual recombination coefficients @xmath24 , where the electron ends up in the atomic level @xmath19 : @xmath25 under the assumption of the ` on the spot ' approximation recombinations into the ground level do not lead to any net effect and thus @xmath26 can be neglected in eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha ] . the resulting net recombination rate which is used in eq .",
    "[ eq : recomb ] is commonly called @xmath22 after the nomenclature introduced by baker & menzel  : @xmath27      knowing the ionization and recombination rates , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the ionization fraction can be calculated from the ionization rate equation .",
    "the time dependency of the ionization fraction in the frame comoving with the corresponding particle , i.e. its lagrangian formulation , is given by : @xmath30      since the spectral distribution of the uv radiation emitted by the photospheres of intermediate to high mass stars is very uncertain , we assume a black radiator with an effective temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we developed two different methods for the numerical treatment of time dependent ionization in the sph calculations . both have in common the method of finding paths from the ionizing source to the particles , along which the optical depth for the lyman continuum photons can be calculated .",
    "they differ in the way the ionization rate is determined given the radiation field .",
    "method a uses the sph formalism to calculate the divergence of the radiation field in eq .  [ eq : ionrate ] . in method",
    "b we adopt a different approach also used in grid methods , where we derive the ionization rate from the difference in the numbers of photons entering and leaving a particle .      first , we specify the position , the rate of ionizing photons @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( from eq .",

    "for each particle  i we now proceed in the following way ( see fig .  [",

    "we choose the angle between , not the distance from , the line of sight , since we are interested in controlling the error in the direction towards the source .",
    "this is not garanteed by the latter criterion .",
    "we store this particle in a list and determine the evaluation point s@xmath35 as the projected particle position on the line of sight . to determine the next evaluation point s@xmath36 even closer to the source we now repeat this method using the neighbor list of particle j and so forth until we reach the source .        now",

    "@xmath39 is the weight factor for each neighboring particle provided by the smoothing kernel .",
    "we calculate the optical depth along the line of sight by applying the trapezian formula , until we reach particle  i : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the position of the evaluation point on the line of sight . note that this treatment neglects the effects of scattering of the ionizing photons by recombination or dust .",
    "the distance between two successive evaluation points is smaller or equal to the local smoothing length , which determines the largest distance of the particles included in the nearest neighbour list as well as the spatial resolution .",
    "this guarantees that the line of sight integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : los ] ) is discretized into a reasonable amount of substeps , consistent with the resolution given by the underlying particle distribution .",

    "we use the following guess for this value : @xmath51 in this equation , we assign an effective radius @xmath52 to each particle i proportional to the mean particle separation , given by @xmath53 .",
    "this is the estimate of the size of a region with the particle mass @xmath54 and density @xmath55 .",
    "the factor with the exponentials on the right hand side accounts for the effect of higher absorption and hence ionization rate with decreasing ionization fraction .",
    "we must use the effective radius @xmath52 in eq .",
    "[ eq : implicit ] instead of the smoothing length @xmath56 , since the method works analogous to implementations in grid codes .",
    "in contrast to the sph formalism , each particle now represents a volume of total mass @xmath57 and density @xmath55 , in which ionizing radiation enters on one side and leaves on the opposite side .",

    "[ eq : implicit ] .",
    "one consequence of the discretization of the ionization rate equation is that the solution in ionized regions tends to oscillate around the equilibrium value .",

    "we can reduce the exponent from @xmath79 to 1 by introducing a ` tolerance angle ' @xmath80 .",
    "suppose we determine the particles along the line of sight as expalined .",
    "as soon as @xmath34 for a particle j along the line of sight towards the source is smaller than @xmath80 we stop our search here .",
    "the optical depth of this particle @xmath81 is then used as an estimate of the optical depth along the remaining part of the line of sight from the source to s@xmath35 .",

    "the results of this calculation will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath91 represents the worst case , since the tolerance angle criterion now is fulfilled for every particle with minimal @xmath34 per search through the nearest neighbour list .",
    "the particles which are most affected by the tolerance angle criterion lie next to the borders of shadows cast by optically thick regions , since here the path for the integration along the line of sight may be bent through the optically thick region , thus decreasing the ionizing flux artificially . in the opposite case ,",
    "the path may lead around the opaque region , increasing the ionizing flux at the position of a particle in the shadow .",

    "the correspnding mean errors in @xmath28 are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 per cent , respectively . for the remaining test cases presented in this paper",
    "the choice of @xmath80 has no effect , since they deal with one - dimensional problems , in which the optical depth is only a function of distance from the source . applying the tolerance angle criterion only shifts the evaluation points from the lines of sight in directions perpendicular to these ,",
    "along which there is no change in the optical depth .",
    "indeed even the choice @xmath103 gives the same results in the one - dimensional test cases as for @xmath90 .",
    "thus the errors introduced by the angle criterion must be checked with problems in which this symmetry is broken and shadows are present , as the one mentioned above .      for reasons of noise reduction we smooth the ionization front , which is not resolvable by the sph representation , over a distance of the order of one local smoothing length .",
    "nature provides a simple way for doing this .",
    "the width of the ionization zone is of the order of one photon mean free path length , @xmath104 where @xmath33 is the net absorption cross section for ionizing photons as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : crossect ] .    since we can not resolve the ionization region anyway , we are free to adjust @xmath105 in a way that the width of the ionization region given by eq .",
    "[ eq : width ] is equal to a constant factor @xmath106 times the local smoothing length @xmath56 , but never larger than the value @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : crossect ] : @xmath107.\\ ] ] test calculations have shown that a good value is @xmath108 .",
    "it has proven to sufficiently reduce numerical noise introduced into the ionization structure by noise in the particle distribution and at the same time to keep the resolution of ionization fronts better than the resolution of the sph formalism in order not to worsen the overall resolution .",
    "note that , when `` smoothing '' the ionization front over @xmath109 times the smoothing length , the noise reducing effect is not caused by the spatial smoothing , since it is ten times smaller than the sph smoothing .",
    "it rather results from a larger number of time steps needed to ionize a particle in the front from an ionization fraction of @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "this gives the neighbouring particles the opportunity to react to the changed state in a smoother way .",
    "we assume that heating and cooling effects lead to an equilibrium temperature of 10000 k in the ionized gas penetrated by ionizing radiation .",
    "the cross sections for elastic electron  electron and electron  proton scattering are of the order @xmath112 .",
    "together with a mean velocity of the electrons of the order of @xmath113 the thermalization timescale for the energies of the ejected electrons is far less than a year for densities of 1 particle @xmath114 , which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the dynamical timescale .",
    "thermalization thus occurs quasi instantaneously .",
    "this process runs even more rapidly for higher densities .",
    "thus we are allowed to treat the gas behind the ionization front as thermalized .",
    "we set the internal energy to : @xmath115 with @xmath116 being the internal energy corresponding to a temperature of 10000 k for ionized hydrogen , and @xmath117 to the internal energy for the 10 k cold , neutral gas .",
    "note that this method does not properly treat recombination zones , since in this case one needs the correct inclusion of the heating and cooling processes in order to achieve the correct gas temperatures , sound velocities and pressures .",
    "also , the equilibrium temperature in hii - regions can vary by 20 per cent from this value .",
    "these deviations can also only be taken into account by proper treatment of heating and cooling .",
    "although being of one - dimensional nature , the following test problems were performed fully in three dimensions .",
    "with this problem we test the implementation of the time - dependent ionization rate equation by ionizing a slab of hi gas of constant density @xmath19 with ionizing radiation falling perpendicular onto one of the boundary surfaces . with hydrodynamics switched off , we let the ionization front traverse the slab with a constant velocity @xmath118 . to achieve this , we have to vary the infalling photon flux with time .",
    "it is given by @xmath119 where the first term on the right hand side is the flux which provides the photons being absorbed in the ionization front .",
    "the second , time - dependent term equals the loss of photons on their way through the slab until they reach the front .    for the initial setup we place a number @xmath77 of particles randomly into a slab with length - to - height and length - to - width ratios of  10 .",
    "subsequently we let the particle distribution relax by evolving it isothermally within the slab , adding a damping term to the force law .",
    "this is necessary to diminish the numerical noise which was introduced by the random distribution .",
    "we now have an ensemble of the particles which does not possess any privileged directions and which represents a gas of constant density and temperature .",
    "we use this distribution as our starting configuration . from now on we keep the particles fixed in space and switch off hydrodynamics .    the test was performed for a total number of @xmath120 and @xmath121 particles .",
    "since the spatial resolution for sph calculations scales as @xmath122 ( with number of neighbours @xmath59 per particle fixed ) , this yields an increase of linear resolution of a factor of two from one simulation to the simulation with next higher resolution .",
    "the results of these tests are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors1 ] .    the mean relative errors between the theoretical result and the calculations decrease linearly with increasing resolution , consistent with our first order discretization of both the line of sight integration and the time dependent ionization equation .",
    "the error also decreases with time as the representation of the ionization front gets thinner and thinner compared to the already ionized region .",
    "the spread in the errors for @xmath123 and @xmath124 results from the fact that in these cases the numerical solution oscillates around the theoretical solution , sometimes being larger than the latter , sometimes smaller .",
    "we proceed as in test 1 , with the difference that we choose a slab with a constant density gradient in the direction of photon propagation .",
    "we choose the time dependence of @xmath125 such that the ionization front should travel through the gas with constant @xmath118 .",

    "[ fig : test0 ] we plot the ionized mass for the theoretical solution and the numerical simulations against time .",
    "the numerical results converge against the theoretical solution with increasing resolution .",
    "the deviations at @xmath129 are caused by the ionization front reaching the rear boundary of the slab .",
    "note that the version of sphi used in this paper is not able to follow ionization fronts exactly which travel faster than one local smoothing length per time step .",
    "this must be taken into account during the timestep determination . in applications with fast ionization fronts ( typically r - type fronts in the early phases of the evolution of hii - regions )",
    "this criterion can lead to very small timesteps and thus to a high amount of cpu time needed .",
    "a version which circumvents this problem is being developed .",
    "for this test we adopt the problem mentioned by lefloch & lazareff  . a box filled with atomic hydrogen of particle density @xmath130 @xmath114 and temperature @xmath131k",

    "the method presented in this paper allows the treatment of the dynamical effects of ionizing radiation in sph calculations .",
    "thus the study of astrophysical problems arising from ionization , like the impact of ionizing radiation from newly born stars onto the evolution of their parental molecular clouds or the more consistent treatment of heating by ob associations in galaxy dynamics calculations are now feasible for the first time with sphi in 3 dimensions .",
    "we demonstrate that the code is able to treat time - dependent ionization , the related heating effects and hydrodynamics correctly .",
    "our first applications , detailed calculations of photoionization induced collapse in molecular clouds and results obtained from them , will be presented in a subsequent paper .    to allow the correct treatment of recombination zones",
    ", one has to include the effects of time dependent heating and cooling processes by ionization and recombination , emission of forbidden lines and thermal radiation from dust .",
    "another important aspect which was neglected here is the effect of the diffuse lyman continuum recombination field .",
    "it can lead to the penetration of regions shielded from the direct ionizing radiation by the ionization front , which is e.g. seen in calculations of photoevaporating protostellar disks @xcite .",
    "an implementation of these processes into our sphi code is planned in the future .",
