    "globular star clusters ( gc s ) have traditionally been assumed to be excellent approximations to so - called `` simple stellar populations , '' which are idealized systems in which all stars were formed at precisely the same time , from a chemically homogeneous cloud .",
    "however , recent observations , both photometric and spectroscopic , have cast serious doubts on this long - standing paradigm .",
    "the presence of large abundance anomalies was first identified in the gc @xmath1  centauri ( ngc  5139 ) . in this cluster ,",
    "not only such light elements as c , n , o , f , na , mg , and al , but also the fe - peak , s - process , and r - process elements , are seen to vary by large amounts from one star to the next ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and the extensive list of references provided therein ) . many of these abundance patterns seem to extend all the way down to the main sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this strongly suggests that such abundance anomalies owe their origin to multiple star formation episodes within the cluster , each accompanied by a corresponding enrichment of the intracluster medium by the ejecta of the massive and intermediate - mass stars which were formed in the prior stellar generations .",
    "while a large spread in fe - peak abundances has only been detected in @xmath1  cen , many of @xmath1  cen s abundance anomalies have also been found in other clusters , albeit often at a ( much ) less dramatic level ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; see also @xcite @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "analyses of the multiple main sequences found in the deep color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd s ) of @xmath1  cen strongly suggest that the _ helium abundance _",
    "@xmath2 in the cluster may also have changed dramatically from one star formation episode to the next ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent evidence suggests that other clusters may also show sizeable @xmath2 variations . according to the deep cmd analysis of ngc  2808 by @xcite , multiple populations with different helium abundances are also present in this cluster .",
    "strong arguments have also been raised in favor of helium enhancements among at least some of the stars in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , these four gc s figure among the most massive of all galactic gc s .    very recently , it has been suggested that multiple star formation episodes in gc s , accompanied by widely different amounts of helium enrichment , are in fact not the exception , but instead the rule @xcite . in the particular case of m3 ( ngc  5272 ) , such a claim had previously been made also by @xcite , on the basis of an analysis of the period distribution of m3 s rr lyrae variables and the color extension of the hb blueward of the instability strip . due to",
    "the recognized need to assume a very sharply peaked mass distribution to account for the sharply peaked shape of the rr lyrae period distribution in m3 @xcite , @xcite suggested that the mass distribution of hb stars is _ always _ sharply peaked , and that the color spread routinely observed in gc cmd s is instead due to internal variations in the helium abundance @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that such a spread in @xmath2 is _ not _ required to explain the observed period distributions .",
    "rather , the case for helium enhancement , at least in the case of m3-like clusters , rests almost entirely on the presence of color spreads among hb stars .        , @xmath3 plane ( panel _ a _ ) , @xmath4 , @xmath3 plane ( panel _ b _ ) , and @xmath5 , @xmath3 plane ( panel _ c _ ) .",
    "the empirical data were shifted vertically so as to produce a satisfactory match to the theoretical red zahb , as given by the @xcite models for @xmath6 } = -1.61 $ ] , @xmath7 = + 0.3 $ ] , and @xmath8 , in the @xmath9 , @xmath3 plane .",
    "the @xcite rgb sequence is also displayed .",
    ", width=272 ]        if confirmed , this scenario would not only have major implications for our understanding of how gc s form , but would also represent a major shift from the canonical paradigm , dominant since the late-1960s / early-1970 s @xcite , which ascribes the color spread seen among hb stars to the stochastic nature of mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "in the canonical scenario , blue hb stars lose significantly more mass as they climb up the rgb than do their red hb counterparts .",
    "in contrast , in the @xcite scenario blue hb stars , even at the `` horizontal '' level of the hb , owe their blue colors to a higher initial @xmath2 . in the specific case of m3 ,",
    "the predicted he enhancement , even in the `` horizontal '' blue hb stars , should fall in the range between 0.02 and 0.025 , according to fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath2 enhancement scenario can be tested , using a variety of photometric and spectroscopic tools , especially for these moderately cool blue hb stars at the `` horizontal '' level .",
    "in particular , it is well known that hb stars with higher @xmath2 are brighter , at a given @xmath10 , due to their stronger h - burning shells ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , in the @xcite scenario bluer hb stars should be brighter than their redder counterparts . while this may help account for the sloping natures of the hb s in the moderately metal - rich gc s ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ,",
    "such a cmd test has never being carried out for most of the gc s that , according to @xcite , present multiple he - enhanced populations .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is accordingly to present a first test of the helium enhancement scenario , in the specific case of m3 , by comparing high - precision photometry for the cluster in the @xcite system , as well as spectroscopically derived gravities , with theoretical hb models computed for a variety of @xmath2 values .",
    "the cmd data used in this paper were taken from @xcite , to which the reader is referred for additional details regarding the calibration of our photometry . briefly",
    ", our m3 photometry is based on a series of images obtained on the nordic optical telescope , using the thinned ar - coated @xmath11 pixel hirac ccd camera , with @xmath12 pixel size , thus covering approximately @xmath13 on a side .",
    "two overlapping fields were observed , with one field centered on the cluster center to ensure a large sample of hb and rgb stars .",
    "in addition to the cmd data , we also used the gravities and temperatures derived by @xcite , on the basis of observations using the hires cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph on the keck  i telescope .",
    "in the present paper , we use the evolutionary tracks computed by @xcite and @xcite for scaled - solar , heavy - element abundances @xmath14 of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "evolutionary tracks for a he abundance @xmath18 by mass were computed for each of these @xmath14 values .",
    "additional he - enhanced tracks for @xmath19 , 0.33 were also computed for @xmath20 .",
    "the theoretical models were transformed to the @xcite @xmath21 system by using the color transformations and bolometric correction tables provided by @xcite .",
    "the same procedures were also adopted in the recent work by @xcite and @xcite , where the period - color and period - luminosity relations of rr lyrae stars in the @xcite system were presented .",
    "in addition , we also use a set of models computed by @xcite , for a chemical composition @xmath6 } = -1.614 $ ] , @xmath7 = + 0.3 $ ] ( which translates , according to those authors , to a @xmath22 ) , and @xmath8 .",
    "m3 has a metallicity of @xmath6 } = -1.57 $ ] in the @xcite scale , and @xmath6 } = -1.34 $ ] in the @xcite scale . taking into account an enhancement of the @xmath23-capture elements by @xmath7 = + 0.27 $ ] @xcite , and using the relation between @xmath14 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath7 $ ] from @xcite , we find an overall metallicity of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , on these two metallicity scales .",
    "therefore , our models comfortably bracket the range of possible metallicity values for the cluster .",
    "since we are primarily interested in constraining the _ change _ in @xmath2 between the red and blue hb , the exact choice of @xmath14 value is basically irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : ztest]_a _ , where our models for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are compared in the @xmath9 , @xmath3 diagram . to produce this plot",
    ", we first registered the low - metallicity zero - age hb ( zahb ) sequences to the @xmath28 zahb by shifting the @xmath26 zahb by @xmath29  mag and the @xmath27 zahb by @xmath30  mag in @xmath9 .",
    "we then applied the same shifts to the evolved hb sequences for each @xmath14 value , and derived several fiducial loci representing evolved hb stars , as follows : i )  mahb , standing for the _ middle - age hb _ , or hb ridgeline , which gives the average position occupied by all hb stars , assuming a uniform mass distribution along the entire zahb ; ii )  90ahb , or _",
    "90%-age hb _",
    ", which is approximately the locus below which one should find @xmath31 of all hb stars ; iii )  tahb , or _",
    "terminal - age hb _",
    ", which is simply the he exhaustion locus .",
    "this registration procedure clearly leads to an excellent match over the entire range of zahb colors and hb luminosities , except ( as expected ) at the extreme red end of the hb and close to the tahb . since m3 lacks unevolved hb stars at colors redder than about @xmath32 , and since the tahb lies very far away from where most hb stars are found ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : singley ] ) , these differences are of no concern for our purposes .",
    "similar results follow when using @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but not @xmath33 , which we have found to be affected by strong metallicity effects .",
    "since the @xmath34- and ( especially ) the @xmath35- band bolometric corrections from @xcite may be quite uncertain ( d. a. vandenberg , priv . comm . ) , we have decided not to include our @xmath35-band photometry in this _ letter _ ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "we will , however , include our @xmath34-band data , but caution that the comparison of these data with the models is less reliable than for the @xmath36 or @xmath37 data .",
    "while the metallicity effects are clearly mild , both the zahb and the evolved hb loci depend strongly on @xmath2 , as can be easily inferred from figure  [ fig : ztest]_b_. this shows that a _ differential _",
    "comparison between the luminosities of red and blue hb stars , around the metallicity of m3 , should provide a strong indicator of any possible helium enhancement , with only a very mild dependence on metallicity .",
    "panels  _ c _ and _ d _ in figure  [ fig : ztest ] reveal the effects of metallicity and @xmath2 , respectively , on the @xmath38 plane .",
    "this again shows that metallicity plays but a minor role in defining the position of a star on this plane , compared with @xmath2 .",
    ", @xmath39 plane , for a metallicity @xmath28 and three different helium abundance values : 0.23 ( panel _ a _ ) , 0.28 ( panel _ b _ ) , and 0.33 ( panel _ c _ ) .",
    "empirical data are provided for m3 ( _ black circles _ ) and m13 ( _ gray circles _ ) , from @xcite . the blue line in panel _",
    "a _ shows the zahb locus of @xcite models for a @xmath8 , @xmath6 } = -1.61 $ ] , @xmath7 = + 0.3 $ ] .",
    ", width=324 ]",
    "we compare the model predictions for fixed ( low ) @xmath2 with the empirical cmd data in figure  [ fig : singley ] . to produce these plots ,",
    "we have first corrected the empirical data for reddening using a @xmath40 , taken from @xcite , and the extinction coefficients for the @xcite system summarized in @xcite .",
    "we then shifted the data vertically , as required to match the theoretical red zahb computed by @xcite to the lower envelope of the observed distribution in the @xmath9 , @xmath3 plane .",
    "note that these @xcite evolutionary tracks also provide an excellent fit to the rgb of the cluster .",
    "this results in a distance modulus of @xmath41 for m3 .",
    "we then applied a shift of @xmath42 to our @xmath28 models , in order that they would match the @xcite ones .",
    "as can be seen , such a procedure leads to an excellent morphological match between the @xcite zahb for @xmath43 and our own for @xmath28 , especially in the @xmath9 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath3 planes , except again at the very end of the red hb distribution , where no unevolved hb stars are found in m3 .    except perhaps for a small deviation of the lower envelope of the blue hb stars in the immediate vicinity of the `` knee '' from the theoretical ( single-@xmath2 ) zahb , this figure shows a remarkable overall agreement between the model predictions and the observations , without an immediately obvious need to invoke an increase in @xmath2 for the blue hb stars .",
    "in addition , all the other hb fiducials for a fixed @xmath2 , including the mahb , 90ahb , and tahb , appear to describe the empirical data fairly well , without significant evidence for an excessive number of overluminous blue hb stars , as would be expected in the helium - enhancement scenario ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ztest]_b _ ) . to be sure",
    ", the evolutionary lifetimes along the canonical tracks do not provide a perfect match to the cmd distribution @xcite ; however , it appears extremely unlikely that any such disagreements may somehow be due to internal variations in @xmath2 , since they seem to affect blue _ and red _ hb stars alike , as also noted by @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : manyy ] we compare our cmd data to zahb sequences for different @xmath2 values in order to obtain a more quantitative limit on any increase in @xmath2 between the red and blue hb populations .",
    "these zahb sequences are all for a fixed @xmath28 and have been shifted by @xmath42 to match the @xcite zahb for @xmath43 , as noted previously .",
    "clearly , an enhancement in @xmath2 by more than 0.01 in the blue hb stars would hardly be compatible with the data .",
    "in particular , we find many more stars below the blue zahb for @xmath44 than below the red zahb for @xmath18 , again with the possible exception of the ( more uncertain ) @xmath5 , @xmath3 plane .",
    "this strongly suggests that the level of he enhancement is most likely less than 0.01 among the cool blue hb stars in m3 .",
    "recall , from figure  4 in @xcite and table  1 in @xcite , that the bulk of the blue hb stars in m3 are predicted , in the helium - enhancement scenario , to be enriched in the range between 0.02 to 0.025 .",
    "such a level of helium enhancement is clearly ruled out by our data .",
    "note also that , in the helium enhancement scenario , one should expect to see an increase in @xmath2 towards bluer colors , but this is not supported by our data .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : loggtest ] compares the empirical and predicted positions of blue hb stars in m3 in the @xmath45 , @xmath39 plane , for three different helium abundances , ranging from 0.23 ( panel _ a _ ) to 0.33 ( panel _ c _ ) . to produce this plot ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to temperatures cooler than 11,500  k , to avoid the well - known complications due to radiative levitation for hotter hb stars @xcite .",
    "our cmd s indicate that less than 5% of all of the hb stars in m3 are hotter than this limit , which corresponds to a color @xmath46 .",
    "similarly to what was found in our cmd analysis , the empirical gravities also seem entirely consistent with a uniform value of @xmath2 among the blue hb stars in m3 .",
    "in addition , there is no indication of an increase in @xmath2 beyond the canonical value , a conclusion which becomes even stronger when the data are compared with the @xmath23-enhanced zahb by @xcite for a @xmath8 , @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , the available data also suggest that at least the redder blue hb stars in m13 ( ngc  6205 ) have a similar helium abundance as in m3 .",
    "the sample size remains relatively small though , and therefore data for more stars in both clusters would certainly prove of interest to derive more conclusive results .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have shown that high - precision , well - populated empirical cmd s , along with spectroscopic gravities , can be used to pose strong constraints on the presence of helium - enriched populations in gc s .",
    "our results strongly suggest that any populations that may have formed after a main initial burst in m3 likely preserved closely the same helium content as in the cluster s primordial gas , with a level of helium enhancement most likely not higher than 0.01 . in future papers , we plan to apply similar tests to several other gc s .",
