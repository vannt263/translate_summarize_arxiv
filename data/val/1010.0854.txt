    "the study of systems composed of a large number of degrees of freedom was endowed a definitive means of reasoning with the introduction of the differential stochastic dynamical framework about a century ago @xcite .",
    "specifically , differential stochastic dynamics allows one to describe the time evolution of a given observable as a function of macroscopic variables of the system as well as non - deterministic ones .",
    "the latter are expressed in terms of noise(s ) , reflecting the microscopic features of the system , whose univocal description is beyond the bounds of possibility  @xcite . despite the impossibility of a deterministic description of the evolution of the observable",
    ", one can successfully obtain time dependent statistical details .",
    "undeniably , einstein s and bachelier s grounbreaking works , respectively on brownian motion @xcite and stock price movements @xcite , are outstanding examples of the relevance of differential stochastic dynamics in diverse fields .",
    "the inference of a differential stochastic process is generically made from statistical features such as statistical moments , correlation functions and probability density functions built from a time series of measurements . in particular , a well established theoretical background for identifying the stochastic dynamics exists for the important class of processes following the markov property  @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , several hindrances arise . specifically , besides matters related to the finite size of data sets  @xcite and to the direct error of the measurements ( associated with the quality of the equipments and/or their calibration  @xcite ) , the sample rating ( the spell between logged measurements ) plays a crucial role in the determination of actual underlying stochastic process . as a matter of fact",
    ", we are generally left a set of snapshots reproducing a fraction of the events that occurred in the continuous time process from which the dynamics is due to be determined . in any case",
    ", it would be important to compare the acquisition interval with the characteristic times of the process to determine whether the kramers - moyal ( km ) coefficients estimates are trustworthy . in this respect ,",
    "another difficulty is that the characteristic times are not always known beforehand , although they can be estimated , e.g. , through the computation of auto - correlation functions .",
    "moreover , when the sampling interval is found to be too long compared with the characteristic timescales , for suitably uncovering the process , it is not always possible to upgrade it , particularly for historical data . for such cases , it is therefore of primary importance a careful analysis of the impact of the time interval @xmath0 of data sampling on the observable finite - time km coefficients , specially as one approaches the independence limit .    for a markovian timeseries ,",

    "herein , we will consider a larger class of processes following two different approaches .",
    "the first one , based on the solution of the evolution equation of the raw statistical moments , represents a simplification regarding the whole process of appraising the finite - time coefficients when the drift is linear .",
    "second , we employ the fokker - planck adjoint operator technique that is useful for processes with nonlinear drifts , for instance .",
    "furthermore , we will analyze the extreme instances of no - fluctuations and independence . the deterministic limit ( absence of fluctuations )",
    "is relevant in stochastic dynamical systems since it provides a reference on the functional behavior of quantities that can be perturbed by augmenting the intensity ( broadness ) of the noise . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the independence limit sets the bounds expected for large acquisition interval and/or large noise intensity .",
    "although it is not always possible a direct inversion of the finite - time estimates to extract the intrinsic ones , the expressions herein obtained can be contrasted against the observed km coefficients , allowing the identification of the underlying process as well as the associated parameter values .",

    "equation  ( [ m1 ] ) also allows one to estimate the conditional two - time covariance function given by  @xcite , @xmath43 that exponentially decays towards the long - time average .",

    "however , any choice of @xmath46 will not alter the exponential character of the correlations since the integration is not carried out over time .",

    ", the intensity of the noise affects every conditional moment and the correlation function as well .",
    "we also showed that by increasing the noise intensity the functional dependence of the km heads towards the independence regime , which is characterized by a polynomial of the same order .",
    "this fact has notorious consequences in time series analysis , since one can be brought onto a situation where independent - like coefficients are obtained , but one is unable to assign this finding to either an improper sample rating or a strong noise intensity .    for sampling rates smaller than the relaxation time , in a steady state approach , our results permit one to sieve the set of processes giving raise to the heuristic stationary probability density function in order to select the appropriate markovian differential stochastic process and consequently to determine the respective parameter values .",
    "furthermore , it enables the judgement of the validity of the markovian proposal by supplying precise estimates of higher order km moments .",
    "otherwise , if the relaxation time is shorter than the sampling rate , the measured km coefficients will tend to a polynomial of order matching the order of the moment .",
    "this functional form is independent of the primary stochastic process , hence introducing uncertainty in the recognition of the process .",
    "uncertainties might be hedged by inspecting probability densities and correlation functions as well as other measures of dependence such as the relative ( kullback - leibler ) entropy .",
