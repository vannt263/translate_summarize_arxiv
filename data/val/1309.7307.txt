    "@xcite , the symmetric repulsive exciton state on a pair of atoms is adiabatically connected with the pair - state @xmath93 , if an initially detuned microwave pulse on the @xmath94 transitions is chirped from large positive detuning to zero detuning .",
    "since the microwave usually couples with equal phases to all atoms , for inter - atomic distances much less than the wavelength , we can only directly access symmetric exciton states in this manner .",
