    "the elasticity and configuration of lipid vesicles have attracted much theoretical attention of physicists @xcite since helfrich proposed the spontaneous curvature model of lipid bilayers in his seminal work @xcite . the shape equation to describe equilibrium configurations of lipid vesicles",
    "was derived in 1987 @xcite based on helfrich s model .",
    "there are two typical analytical solutions to the shape equations .",
    "one is a torus with a ratio ( @xmath0 ) of its two generation radii @xcite .",
    "another is a vesicle with biconcave discoidal shape @xcite .",
    "in fact , the latter solution does not correspond to a vesicle free of external force because of a logarithmic singularity in the solution @xcite .",
    "the opening - up process of lipid vesicles by talin was observed by saitoh _",
    "@xcite , which pushes us to investigate the shape equation and boundary conditions of lipid membranes with free exposed edges .",
    "this topic was discussed theoretically and numerically by several researchers @xcite . based on helfrich s model , the shape equation and boundary conditions",
    "were derived by capovilla _",
    "@xcite , tu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and yin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in different forms .",
    "wang and du obtained various shapes of open membranes through numerical simulations by phase field method @xcite . using the area difference elasticity model , umeda _ et al .",
    "_ derived the shape equation and boundary conditions and then compared their numerical results with the experiment @xcite .",
    "they found that the line tension of the free edge of the open lipid membrane increases with decreasing the concentration of talin @xcite .",
    "the above theoretical and numerical results can be generalized to investigate adhesions between lipid vesicles @xcite , configurations of lipid vesicles with different lipid domains @xcite , and vesicle formation @xcite .",
    "however , the above theoretical researches @xcite do not contain sufficient discussions on analytical solutions to the shape equation with the boundary conditions .",
    "additionally , the authors merely compared their numerical results with the experimental ones qualitatively in their numerical work @xcite .",
    "it is still lack of the quantitative comparison between the numerical and experimental results .",
    "two natural questions are led to : can we find analytical solutions ?",
    "at least , it is instructive to investigate the possibility of finding the analytical solutions .",
    "can we use the numerical results to fit the experimental data quantitatively ?",
    "we hope we can do that by taking the number of parameters as small as possible .    generally speaking , the shape equation derived from helfrich s model is a fourth - order nonlinear differential equation , while the boundary conditions include three nonlinear equations describing the shapes of the free edges of lipid membranes . in principle , one can obtain the general solution with unknown constants to a linear differential equation , and then determine the unknown constants by using the linear boundary conditions .",
    "thus there is no mathematical difficulty to find the solution satisfying both the linear differential equation and linear boundary conditions .",
    "however , the problem becomes more complicated if both the differential equation and boundary conditions are nonlinear .",
    "there is no general solution to a nonlinear differential equation in mathematics .",
    "consequently , one can only conjecture some special solutions in a few cases .",
    "if we further consider the boundary conditions , only a few ones among the above known solutions can fit them .",
    "therefore , it is quite helpful to investigate the feature of the special solutions that can satisfy both the nonlinear differential equation and the boundary conditions .",
    "since it is very difficult to obtain solutions to the shape equation with the boundary conditions , we may first conjecture a surface satisfying the shape equation , and then find a curve in the surface satisfying the boundary conditions as an edge of the surface .",
    "however , one might not find any curve satisfying the boundary conditions for a given surface satisfying the shape equation .",
    "only some special ones among the surfaces satisfying the shape equation can admit the boundary conditions .",
    "the profound reason is that the points in the boundary curve should satisfy not only the boundary conditions , but also the shape equation because they also locate in the surface . in other words , there exist some additional constraints between the shape equation and the boundary conditions . these constraints which have not been touched in refs .",
    "@xcite are called the compatibility condition in this paper .",
    "it is not a straightforward task to find the compatibility condition in general case .",
    "the axisymmetric lipid membranes with edges will give us some clues .",
    "the shape equation is reduced to a third - order differential equation in axisymmetric case @xcite .",
    "zheng and liu proved that it was integrable @xcite , and could be further transformed into a second - order differential equation with an integral constant . in this paper , we will show that the compatibility condition is that this integral constant vanishes for axisymmetric membranes . due to this compatibility",
    ", the shape equation is reduced to a second - order differential equation while the boundary conditions are reduced to two equations .",

    "these theorems also correct two flaws on analytical solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "( ii ) we use the shooting method to find numerical solutions . but",
