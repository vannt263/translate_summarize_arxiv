    "carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are long , thin tubes constructed from sheets of graphite . because of their many novel properties",
    "cnt have numerous potential applications in material science ,  @xcite optics  @xcite and electronics,@xcite while also contributing to our knowledge of fundamental physics .",
    "@xcite they are extremely strong , owing to being constructed from @xmath3 bonds , and yet their low density makes them extremely light .",
    "cnt have the highest tensile strength and elastic modulus of any known material  @xcite but this impressive strength is only applicable to forces which stretch the nanotube as their hollow structure means they readily become distorted under torsion , compression or bending .  @xcite the electrical properties of a cnt depend on its structure .",
    "single walled cnt are generally classified as one of three types : zigzag , armchair or chiral , and these classifications are defined by the orientation of the graphene lattice about the tube . from band structure calculations ,",
    "armchair cnt are always metallic with current densities which may possibly exceed silver and copper ,  @xcite while zigzag and chiral cnt can be metallic , semiconducting or insulating depending on the width and helicity of the tube .  @xcite    the simple band structure calculations used to determine whether or not a cnt is metallic are performed in the weakly interacting limit . in general this limit is not applicable to cnt as they tend to have long - range coulomb interactions which are not small , though one can justify considering only weak short - range interactions if the cnt is screened .",
    "screening can be achieved either by arranging several nanotubes in an array or rope - like structure ,  @xcite or by placing a single nanotube close to a conducting plate .",
    "@xcite studies on armchair cnt with long - range interactions have shown that the doped cnt ground state is a metallic tomanaga - luttinger liquid  @xcite while the ground state of the undoped cnt has a number of possible phases including mott insulators and density waves .",
    "@xcite some of these phases have also been found in doped and undoped armchair cnt with short - range interactions .",
    "@xcite    here we consider a metallic zigzag cnt which we assume to be screened so that only on - site and nearest neighbour interactions need to be considered .",
    "our main purpose is to determine which ground state phases can be supported by a metallic zigzag cnt with short - range interactions , and to describe the phase transitions between these phases .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian of a metallic cnt may be mapped onto the well known hubbard hamiltonian of a two - leg ladder ,  @xcite though the nature of the two - leg ladder is dependent on the chirality of the nanotube .",
    "the armchair cnt maps onto a fairly standard form of the two - leg ladder where hopping between any two adjacent lattice sites along either leg is always the same , as is hopping along any rung i.e. , between legs .",
    "so , it is not hard to determine the behaviour of an armchair cnt directly from known results of two - leg ladders .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the metallic zigzag cnt maps onto an unusual type of two - leg ladder in which the hopping part describes two chains with hopping strength alternating between lattice sites , but no hopping between legs .",
    "the two chains however can not be described as independent as they influence each other through coulomb interactions .",
    "the nearest neighbour coulomb interactions in an armchair cnt map rather simply onto a two - leg ladder , acting between nearest neighbours either along the rungs or along the legs .",
    "@xcite the situation is quite different in the two - leg ladder equivalent of a zigzag cnt . in this case",
    "the interactions in the ladder act either between nearest neighbours along the legs or between next nearest neighbours on different legs .",
    "initially we hoped that these more complex interactions would have an interesting effect on the phase diagram , possibly allowing some unusual phases with broken time - reverasl symmetry .",
    "for instance , it is interesting to explore whether a staggered flux phase exists under physically possible conditions . as we shall show later ,",
    "this is not the case and the physically possible phases of a zigzag cnt are similar to those found in an armchair cnt .",
    "we determine that our metallic cnt can support at least seven different phases when there is no doping , though some of these phases are only found when attractive interactions are permitted .",
    "four phases are mott insulators , two with @xmath0-wave symmetry which we name d - mott and d@xmath4-mott , and two with @xmath1-wave symmetry which we name s - mott and s@xmath4-mott .",
    "these four mott phases are analogous to those found in a standard two - leg ladder and so we have adopted the same naming convention .",
    "@xcite the oder parameters of currents and/or bond hopping are always zero in the mott insulator phases , and the average electron density is always one electron per site .",
    "these phases are classified as @xmath0-wave or @xmath1-wave based on the nature of the pairing correlations .",
    "illustrations of all four mott states in both the honeycomb lattice of the zigzag cnt and the equivalent two - leg ladder are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : phases](a),(b),(c ) and ( d ) . in these figures",
    "the circles represent an @xmath1-wave pairing of two electrons with opposite spin .",
    "one pair must occupy one of two possible sites but which site is chosen is completely random , ensuring an average electron density of one electron per site . in the s - mott the two possible positions for one electron pair are nearest neighbours",
    "so we draw circles between all nearest neighbours . in the s@xmath4-mott",
    "the two possible positions for one pair are next - nearest neighbours so the circles are drawn between next - nearest neighbours .",
    "the @xmath0-wave pairing is represented by ellipses . in this case paired electron occupy different sites , though the positions of the different spins are not ordered but random .",
    "the paired electrons are nearest neighbours in the d - mott so the ellipses are drawn along the bonds joining nearest neighbours . in the d@xmath4-mott",
    "the pairing is between next - nearest neighbours so the ellipses ( distorted for clarity in the two - leg ladder case ) join next - nearest neighbour sites .",
    "the remaining three phases are density waves which all exhibit a broken z@xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the charge density wave ( cdw ) has broken particle - hole symmetry so there is a regular variation in the electron distribution along the lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases](e ) . as before the circles represent a pair of opposite spin electrons .",
    "a major difference between the cdw and the two @xmath1-wave mott states is that positions of the pairs in the cdw is not random .",
    "the @xmath2-density wave ( pdw ) is equivalent to a spin - peierls state where dimers form between neighbouring sites as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases](f ) .",
    "the thickness of the dashed and solid black lines indicates the magnitude of the kinetic energy exchange between sites , though these two types lines have opposite signs .",
    "the chiral current phase ( ccp ) describes a state in which a current circulates around the nanotube , flowing between nearest neighbours .",
    "this is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases](g ) with the arrows describing the current . in the equivalent two - leg ladder",
    "all currents vanish because the two - leg ladder lies along the longitudinal axis of cnt and the net current along the longitudinal axis of the cnt is zero .",
    "there is fourth density wave phase which is theoretically possibly , though we do not find it in our phase diagram .",
    "this phase is a @xmath6-density wave ( fdw ) which has a circulating current which flows between next - nearest neighbours , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases](h ) .",
    "the current in the equivalent two - leg ladder vanishes , again because the net current along the cnt longitudinal axis is zero .",
    "the eight phases are essentially equivalent to phases found in the armchair cnt ( though the phase diagram is not identical ) , and comparable to phases found in the two - leg ladder , with the exception of the ccp .",
    "when an armchair cnt is in a ccp the equivalent two - leg ladder is in a staggered flux ( sf ) phase in which current flows around plaquettes between nearest neighbours , with the direction of the current being opposite in neighbouring plaquettes .",
    "@xcite the two - leg ladder equivalent of the zigzag cnt s ccp resembles a sf phase , yet it can not be a true sf phase as this ladder does not have standard plaquettes around which a non - zero current may flow .",
    "if a two - leg ladder or cnt is lightly doped away from half - filling different phases emerge , yet they are still closely related to the phases found in the half - filled case .",
    "two phases are superconducting , one being @xmath0-wave ( d - sc ) and the other @xmath1-wave ( s - sc ) .",
    "the d - sc can be thought of as a merging of the d - mott and the d@xmath4-mott insulator phases found in the undoped case .",
    "similarly , the s - sc is a merging of the undoped s - mott and s@xmath4-mott phases .",
    "the doped two - leg ladder and cnt have two density wave phases .",
    "one is a combination of the undoped cdw and pdw phases . for simplicity we will refer to this doped phase as a cdw .",
    "the other density wave is a combination of the ccp and the fdw in the cnt ( or a sf and fdw in the two - leg ladder ) , and we shall refer to this phase as a ccp .",
    "the general appearance of the phase diagrams of the doped and undoped cases are quite similar , although , in the undoped cases the mott insulator phases tend to dominate most of the phase diagram , while on doping the density wave regions are significantly enhanced .",
    "one fascinating characteristic of undoped two - leg ladders , also shown to exist in cnt , is dynamical symmetry enlargement ( dse ) . in the two - leg ladder",
    "the symmetry of the original hubbard hamiltonian is u(1)@xmath7su(2 ) but the effective hamiltonian obtained after solving the renormalization group ( rg ) equations is equivalent to a gross - neveu ( gn ) model with a so(8 ) symmetry , which is far larger than the original symmetry .",
    "@xcite all phases exhibit dse , yet they do not all share the same so(8 ) symmetry . a doped two - leg ladder can still be mapped onto a gn model with dse , but with the smaller so(6 ) symmetry .",
    "@xcite it is important to note that dse is a consequence of weak coupling and begins to break down as the coupling increases .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the so(8 ) symmetry is not particularly realistic as it depends on an equal charge and spin gap , while in reality the charge gap is substantially larger than the spin gap . in contrast , the so(6 ) symmetry is fairly realistic as doping removes the charge gap but has no effect on the spin gap .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we show how a hubbard model describing a metallic zigzag cnt at half - filling with both on - site and nearest neighbour interactions may be mapped onto a two - leg ladder .",
    "the hamiltonian is then bosonized . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phases ] we obtain all phases and phase transitions by solving the rg equations under different initial conditions and substituting the results into the bosonized hamiltonian .",
    "we then show how the effective hamiltonian can be represented as a so(8 ) gn model with enlarged symmetry .",
    "we use a variety of order parameters such as the current and the electron density to determine the characteristics of each phase .",
    "we discuss the nature of the phase transitions and show that they can mostly be classified as either gaussian or ising . in sec .",
    "[ sec : doped ] we consider the case of a doped cnt .",
    "the hamiltonian is similar to the undoped hamiltonian , except for the absence of umklapp interactions .",
    "using a rg analysis and bosonization we find the doped nanotube s ground state phases and the phase transitions between them and we show that all phases map to an effective so(6 ) gn hamiltonian . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : qn ] we discuss some general properties of the so(2n ) gn model .",
    "in this section we show how the zigzag cnt hubbard model with on - site and nearest neighbour interactions may be mapped onto a two - leg ladder hubbard model . after some standard approximations we bosonize the hamiltonian .",
    "these derivations are not new ,  @xcite except for the addition of the nearest neighbour interactions , and therefore our derivation will be rather brief .",
    "a carbon graphene lattice may be represented by two regular triangular sublattices , offset by @xmath8 and with sublattice basis vectors @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sublattice lattice constant , as illustrated in fig .",

    "a single walled cnt is formed by making a cylinder out of any graphene lattice , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] . if this lattice is rolled along a horizontal axis so that the top is joined to the bottom of the lattice ( while retaining the regular hexagonal structure ) we obtain an armchair cnt .",

    "a chiral cnt is any other cylinder which can be created from a graphene lattice which is neither armchair nor zigzag . here",

    "to determine when the zigzag cnt is metallic we derive the band structure in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the @xmath16-axis of the zigzag cnt is defined to be in the longitudinal direction of the nanotube and the @xmath31-axis is around the nanotube in the transverse plane . as the momentum must be quantized in the @xmath31 direction @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of lattice sites around the circumference of the cnt and the circumference is @xmath34 .",

    "@xcite the electronic charge in the two - leg ladder or cnt is defined as @xmath151 the spin is defined by @xmath152 from which we obtain @xmath153 the relative @xmath154-component spin in different bands is @xmath155/2\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\delta\\theta_{\\sigma-}/2\\pi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the relative @xmath154-component vector chirality in different bands is @xmath156/2\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\delta\\varphi_{\\sigma-}/2\\pi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the relative band chirality is @xmath157 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\delta\\varphi_{\\rho-}/2\\pi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for all the undoped cnt mott phases @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , which after using eq . ( [ eq : charges ] ) gives @xmath162 .",
    "as @xmath163 for integral @xmath164 we have @xmath165 , showing that the kinks span all possible particles . for the undoped cnt density wave phases",
    "only @xmath166 is different when compared to the mott phases . in this case",
    "we have @xmath167 so @xmath168 .",
    "doping breaks the large so(8 ) symmetry but despite this we may still represent the so(6 ) solitons as we represented the so(8 ) solitons .",
    "the so(6 ) gn model does not contain @xmath169 so @xmath170 is not a good quantum number and the solitons should be defined by @xmath171 in the superconducting sates or @xmath172 in the density waves .",
    "however , this gn model does not describe the full hamiltonian . to obtain the full hamiltonian",
    "we must include a chemical potential term to the hamiltonian , @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the chemical potential .",
    "therefore @xmath170 is still a good quantum number of the doped hamiltonian , even though the symmetry between @xmath170 and the so(6 ) generators is broken .",
    "so , as in the undoped cnt phase , @xmath162 for the doped cnt mott phases and @xmath168 for the doped cnt density wave phases .",
    "other quantum numbers can also be derived , although they will not be simply related to the @xmath114 charges .",
    "for example , the momentum in the @xmath16 direction ( along both legs ) may be written as @xmath175/2\\pi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at half - filling the energy dispersion is degenerate and @xmath176 so @xmath177 . if the system is doped we move away from half - filling so @xmath178 .",
    "as @xmath179 is not defined in the doped case with so(6 ) symmetry @xmath180 is not a well defined quantum number .",
    "the metallic zigzag cnt with weak coupling and short - range interactions has a complex phase diagram .",
    "we classify all ground states as well as all phase transitions for both the undoped case and the doped case within the parameter range @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain these results by exploiting the relationship between a zigzag cnt and an unusual form of a two - leg ladder .",
    "once the cnt model has been mapped to this two - leg ladder , well established rg and bosonizations techniques are applied to reveal the phase diagram .",
    "previous studies on both doped and undoped armchair cnt and their equivalent two - leg ladders have found phases similar to those found here .",
    "though we did expect to find similar phases in these two cnt , we did not expect to find similar phase diagrams as the initial conditions of the rg equations for the armchair and zigzag cnt are very different ( eq . ( [ eq : initialcoupling ] ) for the zigzag case ) .",
    "surprisingly , despite very different initial conditions , the repulsive interactions part of our zigzag cnt phase diagram is remarkably similar to the armchair cnt phase diagram ( with interactions @xmath181 and @xmath18 ) , but with the @xmath29 and @xmath28 axes exchanged and the latter axis rescaled .",
    "@xcite we find that this is true for both the doped and undoped cases .",
    "in other words , the positive @xmath29 and @xmath28 segment of figs . [",
    "fig : phase+ ] and [ fig : phasedoped+ ] is similar to the phase diagram of the armchair cnt with the same interactions and hopping but with @xmath29 and @xmath28 exchanged .",
    "this is quite likely related to relative rotations of the graphene lattices in the two cnt as in the zigzag cnt @xmath29 describes interactions in the longitudinal direction while @xmath28 describes interactions around the circumference , yet in the armchair cnt @xmath28 is around the circumference and @xmath29 is in the longitudinal direction .    once the ground states have been established a refermionization of their associated hamiltonians reveal that they can all be mapped onto a so(2n ) gn model , where @xmath182 for the undoped case and @xmath183 for the doped case . in both cases",
    "the symmetry is much larger than the symmetry of the initial hamiltonian so both are examples of dynamical symmetry enlargement .",
    "though all phases in the undoped case have an so(8 ) symmetry , they do not all share the same subalgebra .",
    "similarly , in the doped case no two phases share the same so(6 ) subalgebra .",
    "the subalgebra shared by two phases can hint at the symmetry of the phase transition between these two phases .",
    "we observed that if two so(2n ) phases share a so(2n-1 ) subalgebra then the phase transition between these two phases is ising and at the transition the massive fields are defined by a so(2n-1 ) gn model .",
    "if instead the two phases share a so(2n-2 ) subalgebra then the phase transition is gaussian with the massive fields defined by a so(2n-2 ) gn model . in both these cases",
    "the fields which are pinned to equal values on either side of the transition remain massive at the phase transition , while the fields which change their pinned values become massless at the phase transition .",
    "this is why the shared symmetry of the two phases is equivalent to the symmetry of the phase transition .",
    "we can not , however , always expect this to be the case .",
    "the d - mott phase and the pdw phase share an so(3 ) symmetry and yet at the phase transition the massive modes are described by a so(5 ) gn model .",
    "this phase transition is distinctly different from the gaussian and ising transitions because in this case it is the fields which change their values across the transition which remain massive while the fields which do not change their values becomes massless .",
