    "there are many puzzles encountered in understanding the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and the spheroidal components of spiral galaxies .",
    "on the one hand a naive reading of the hierarchical theory of structure formation in a @xmath7cdm universe would argue that , since massive halos form later than less massive ones , massive ellipticals which reside in the centers of these massive halos should also form late .",
    "but there is strong observational evidence that old , massive , red and metal rich proto - ellipticals are already in place at @xmath8 and that present day early - type galaxies formed most of their stars well before a redshift @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we also know from evidence dating to the 1970 s that current rates of star formation in these systems are quite low , the rates increasing sharply into the past as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "further , with regard to the evolution of this population , there appears to be a significant increase in the total stellar mass in these old objects from @xmath9 to the present @xcite , but this can not easily be accounted for by the fading of younger , bluer star forming galaxies present at @xmath11 @xcite . this has led to the plausible and popular idea that ` dry merging ' ( i.e. merging of predominantly stellar systems ) among elliptical systems @xcite pushes more and more of the mass over the observational cutoff to provide an increased number of 0.5 - 2@xmath12 galaxies .",
    "this attractive idea gives reasonable explanations for some observed correlations of the mass of ellipticals and their kinematics , sizes or isophotal shape @xcite .",
    "however , noting that there are tight relations among luminosity , color , age and metalicity , puts severe limits on the amount of late dry merging that could acceptably occur without destroying the aforementioned constraints .    on the theoretical side",
    "it is now possible to perform accurate high resolution simulations of the gravitational evolution of the dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the numerical simulation of galaxy formation , including a hydrodynamic treatment of the baryonic component , is still in its infancy .",
    "very few high resolution simulations from realistic cosmological initial conditions have been done so far and most of these have concentrated on the formation of disc galaxies rather than early - type spheroidal systems @xcite .",
    "this is surprising since spheroidal systems are of interest in their own right , as they contain more than half of the total stellar mass in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the most massive galaxies known , the giant ellipticals , are spheroidal systems which predominantly consist of old stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) and so must have formed at high redshift .",
    "they are therefore likely to be good probes of galaxy assembly , star formation and metal enrichment in the early universe .    , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 sph particles and collisionless dark matter particles , respectively .",
    "note how the rotation curves become increasingly flat as the resolution increases .",
    "[ rotcurve_haloa],width=302 ]    , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 sph particles and collisionless dark matter particles , respectively .",
    "there is a strong trend that the low redshift star formation rate is reduced in higher resolution simulations .",
    "[ sfr],width=302 ]    most numerical work on early - type galaxy formation has used either very idealized initial conditions @xcite , or had insufficient spatial and mass resolution to resolve the internal structures of galaxies @xcite .",
    "an exception is the simulation discussed by @xcite .",
    "these authors used an sph simulation that included feedback from supernovae to follow the formation of a single spheroidal galaxy self - consistently from cdm initial conditions .",
    "the spatial resolution of this simulation was high enough to resolve the region within an effective radius for a typical real elliptical galaxy . however , the final stellar system formed in this simulation was far too dense , with an effective radius about an order of magnitude smaller than real elliptical galaxies of the same brightness .",
    "@xcite speculate that this discrepancy may be a consequence of their star formation and feedback algorithm and that it might be possible to produce less concentrated systems if more aggressive stellar feedback were implemented to prevent star formation in high density sub - units at high redshift .",
    "in this paper we present high resolution hydrodynamical simulations based on cosmological initial conditions admitting , intentionally , only bare - bones prescriptions for the physics involved ( e.g. no `` feedback '' from supernovae or agn ) , to see if some resolution of these paradoxes can be derived .",
    "the rationale for simplyfing the simulations is straightfoward .",
    "as we will show in section [ massive ] , at least @xmath14 gas particles are required for hydrodynamical simulations to ` converge ' , making them very expensive to run . with present generation computers it is impossible to run a large ensemble of simulations of this size to properly explore a huge parameter space .",
    "our point of view , therefore , is to keep the physics of the simulations as simple as possible and to get an understanding of the behaviour of a simplified problem before investigating additional complexities such as supernova and agn feedback .",
    "our goalin this paper , therefore , is to investigate the formation of a number of massive ( @xmath16 ) isolated galaxies starting from realistic initial conditions and to see how variable the final systems and whether they resemble real galaxies .",
    "what we find can be summarized simply .",
    "the initial cooling and collection of cold gas from infalling smaller scale perturbations happens very rapidly and easily within the most massive systems leading to a very rapid burst of star formation beginning at @xmath17 and then falling off exponentially on a time - scale of roughly 1.5gyrs .",
    "this phase is terminated as the star forming region is enveloped in an expanding hot bubble which prevents new , infalling cold gas mass elements from reaching the central regions .",
    "this early phase - reminiscent in some respects to a modernized version of the `` monolithic collapse '' picture of galaxy formation , prominent in the 1960 s through 1980 s @xcite- produces a sequence of objects with effective radii of 1 - 2kpc , which might satisfy the tight relations observed among the red metal rich old cores of elliptical galaxies .    for simulations with early - type properties at @xmath18 stellar accretion or mergers ( the choice of the appropriate term for the process is arbitrary and dependent on the relative mass of the infalling stellar objects ) add to the growing stellar envelope of relatively blue , old and metal poor stars .",
    "this accounts for the growth in size seen for ellipticals as well as the growth in total mass in the time frame @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , since this assembly of added stellar mass is not accompanied by much in situ star formation ( the coterminously added hot and cold gas being simply added to the expanding hot bubble surrounding the central galaxy ) the growth of the stellar population occurs without the presence of young stars",
    ". existing work has shown that the tightness of the elliptical color - magnitude relation puts strong constraints on dry merger scenarios @xcite .",
    "but we find that in our simulations that minor mergers or accretion events do not typically add much stellar mass to the central region , because of the relatively large angular momentum of the infalling systems - and thus the central , tight color - magnitude relations are not expected to be overly perturbed even if as much as 40% of the total final mass is added during this phase . as an additional byproduct of this assembly scenario ,",
    "we find it readily understandable how so much of the stellar mass in these systems resides in regions of such low density , where star formation would always have been difficult to contemplate .",
    "the stars seen at @xmath19 were not born there , but rather were formed in the central regions of much lower mass systems that have been accreted and shredded in the envelopes of the giant elliptical galaxies .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    ", width=302 ]     softening lengths ( shaded area ) were excluded from the fits as they are likely to be influenced by force softening .",
    "the error bars are given by the poissonian error of the particles in the fitted regime .",
    "the errors for the srsic index @xmath20 and the effective radius @xmath21 have been determined by the bootstrapping method .",
    "galaxies a and c can be fitted well by a single srsic function whereas galaxy e can only be fitted by a two component fit ( see text ) .",

    "these seem very reasonable , in marked contrast to the results of e.g. @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are dominated by luminous matter inside @xmath22 kpc and the fraction of dark matter within the half - mass radii is @xmath23 .",
    "this is consistent with most findings based on observations and dynamical modeling that early - type galaxies are dominated by luminous matter in their inner parts @xcite .",
    "however , dynamical modeling of observed ellipticals also indicates that dark matter becomes dominant beyond 2 - 3 half - mass radii whereas for the simulated galaxies a , c , and e dark matter becomes dominant at a factor of two larger radii .",

    "we have computed the luminosities of the galaxies using the @xcite spectro - photometric models assuming a salpeter imf and solar metalicity . as all galaxies had recent star formation on various levels ( see fig .",
    "[ sfr_all ] ) , they are shifted blue - ward from the color magnitude relation of cluster ellipticals ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , for galaxies a and c the effect is not very strong and any process that would suppress central star formation within the last @xmath26 yrs would shift the galaxies ( with the exception of galaxy e ) to the observed relation .",
    "higher numerical resolution might result in a similar effect , as galaxy a at @xmath15 resolution falls right on the color - magnitude relation .",
    "however , it is not unusual for field ellipticals ( e+a phenomenon ) to actually show residual star formation @xcite .",

    "all galaxies start to form when cold gas that has collapsed in subunits is effectively consumed by star formation . at early times the remaining diffuse gas is predominantly heated by shocks . in general the stars galaxies assemble both by in situ star formation as well as major / minor mergers and accretion . during the early formation phase at @xmath65 the assembly of the galaxies is dominated by mergers of gas rich subcomponents and in situ star formation .",
    "although some fraction of the stars is accreted this phase has the characteristics of a dissipative collapse .",
    "thereafter stellar accretion or minor / major mergers become more important and , for early - type galaxies , tends to dominate for @xmath66 .",
    "after z=1 the further assembly of the galaxies varies from halo to halo .",
    "the evolution of one galaxy is dominated by gas infall and in situ star formation at rates of @xmath67/yr .",
    "it develops a massive , however too compact , stellar disk and has properties more similar to early - type disk galaxies .",
    "two other galaxies have present day properties more similar to elliptical galaxies and their assembly is dominated by minor and major predominantly stellar mergers .",
    "one of the galaxies grows by minor mergers and does not experience a major merger after its formation phase . at redshift @xmath2",
    "it has formed a massive stellar spheroid ( see e.g. @xcite ) which resembles observed massive evolved galaxies and their inferred formation histories .",
    "the system evolves into an old stellar system surrounded by a halo of hot gas at the present day .",
    "the second early - type galaxy had a major merger at z=0.6 that can be classified as a gas poor or dry merger as it was not accompanied by a strong burst of star - formation .",
    "from those two examples we find that @xmath68 15% - 35% of the final stellar mass was assembled by accretion of stars that have formed outside the galaxy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this increase will contribute to the evolution of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies from @xmath69 in addition to a fading population of blue galaxies and mergers @xcite .",
    "the size evolution of the simulated early - type galaxies is determined by the accreted stars .",
    "while the half - mass radius of the stars formed in - situ remains almost constant independent of redshift at @xmath70 kpc the accreted stars create an envelope whose half - mass radius is increasing with decreasing redshift ( see @xcite , for a semi - analytical approach ) .",
    "interestingly , a significant fraction of the stars at the final half - mass radius of the galaxies were not born there but accreted .",
    "this process might provide a good explanation for a possible size evolution of early - type galaxies @xcite without changing the fundamental parameter relations which are determined by the central properties of the galaxies and should have been established during the early formation phase .    at the present day",
    "most investigated kinematical and photometric properties ( see also @xcite ) are consistent with observed rotating disky and boxy early - type galaxies at similar luminosities . in particular , the concentration is in good agreement with observations .",
    "we believe that the discrepancy with @xcite is due to the different star formation algorithm which in their case allows predominantly gaseous subunits to merge and develop a high concentration before forming stars . in our simulations gas",
    "is converted into stars efficiently in subunits which merge at early times , prior to z=2 , and so the morphology of the systems is elliptical if its late accretion is dominated by stars .",
    "interestingly , the early - type galaxy with the late major merger develops a counter rotating core which previously only have been successfully simulated in isolated equal - mass disk - disk mergers @xcite and are supposed to be signposts of merger events .",
    "feedback from supernovae and/or agn , which was not included in this simulation , would provide additional heat sources but appear neither vital to stop the star formation and produce a massive red galaxy at higher redshifts nor to produce a present day stellar system with consistent kinematical properties .",
    "theoretical arguments ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that stellar feedback rapidly becomes ineffective in systems with velocity dispersions greater than 100 km / s",
    ". however , agn feedback may be important in galaxies with high velocity dispersions . in our case",
    "agn feedback might have been able to prevent further star formation at low redshift by heating the cold gas at the center of the galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "many field ellipticals show the related e+a phenomenon which seems to be suppressed in the centers of clusters as any residual cold gas will be blown away @xcite . for more massive systems than the ones studied here",
    "it has been argued that feedback from agn might have a bigger impact and be responsible for the sharp cutoff at the bright end of the luminosity function of ellipticals @xcite .",
    "however , only full cosmological simulations at high resolution of the formation of more massive systems will help to fully understand the importance of stellar and agn feedback on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies .    in a hierarchical universe most galaxies",
    "are expected to experience mergers but it has been argued for a long time that dissipation is essential to explain properties of elliptical galaxies and in particular intermediate mass ellipticals ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) . the cosmological formation processes presented here combines characteristics of both stellar mergers and dissipational collapse / mergers whereas the latter dominates the early formation phase .",
    "it naturally meets many observational constraints on the evolution of massive spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". it might be equally or even more important than major mergers of disk galaxies @xcite which can not reproduce the properties the most massive ellipticals @xcite whose evolution could be driven by mergers of evolved ellipticals @xcite .",
