    "in recent years the colossal magnetoresistance manganese perovskites have attracted much attention.@xcite the low energy ( @xmath14 ev ) physics of these materials is believed to be governed by mn @xmath2 electrons , which are coupled by a strong hund s coupling , @xmath3 , to mn @xmath4 symmetry ` core spins ' and also interact with each other and with lattice distortions .",
    "three important and still unresolved issues are the value of @xmath3 , the strength of the jahn - teller(jt ) electron - phonon coupling @xmath5 , and the magnitude of the effective @xmath2-@xmath2 on - site coulomb interaction @xmath6 governing the low energy physics .",
    "the relative importance of the electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions is a particularly important open question .",
    "hund s coupling @xmath3 is believed to be large , because in good samples at low temperatures , observed magnetic moments are close to their saturation values.@xcite however , @xmath3 has not been directly measured .",
    "estimates ranging from @xmath7 2 ev ( ref . ) to 3 ev ( ref . ) have been obtained from the analysis of the optical measurements of doped materials .",
    "however , these estimates depend upon proper identification of features in the observed optical conductivity , and this identification is at present disputed .    the value of the effective coulomb repulsion is also unclear .",
    "high energy photoemission spectroscopy@xcite yields a bare repulsion @xmath8 8 ev , but also implies that the manganites are in the class of charge - transfer materials,@xcite as are the high-@xmath9 cuprates . in charge - transfer materials",
    "the low energy ( @xmath10 ) electronic degrees of freedom are complicated linear combinations of transition metal and oxygen orbitals , and the effective repulsion for these orbitals may be much less than @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in high @xmath9 materials , @xmath12 10 ev but the @xmath6 relevant to the low energy physics is rather less ; perhaps @xmath13 2 ev ( ref . ) .",
    "the proper value of the @xmath6 relevant to the low energy ( @xmath14 4 ev ) physics of manganites is at present disputed .",
    "some authors argue that electron - electron interactions are dominant ; others that electron - phonon interactions are crucial .    in this communication ,",
    "we show how measurements of the magnitude , anisotropy and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity of the manganites insulating ` parent compound ' @xmath0 can help to resolve these issues .",
    "we obtain an effective hamiltonian for the low energy degrees of freedom by fitting band theory calculations to a tight binding model and adding coulomb interaction terms .",
    "we then determine its optical conductivity as a function of temperature , and show how the different features in the spectrum may be used to determine the interaction parameters .",
    "the advantage of the tight binding approach is that it compactly represents the low energy degrees of freedom , allows straitforward inclusion of interaction effects , and is computationally cheap enough that many parameter choices may be investigated .",
    "the material is a ( 0,0,@xmath15 ) antiferromagnet at low temperatures , while a paramagnet at room temperature .",
    "the hund s coupling therefore leads to a peak structure with a pronounced and strongly temperature - dependent anisotropy .",
    "observation of this effect would provide a definitive determination of the hund s coupling parameter .",
    "the jahn - teller and coulomb interactions lead to similar effects in the absorption spectrum ; indeed the two interactions roughly add .",
    "the strength of the jahn - teller coupling may be determined from crystallography data or from band theory ; interestingly the two determinations agree very well .",
    "the effect of the jahn - teller coupling on the optical conductivity may essentially be calculated exactly .",
    "we compare the results of this calculation to the optical conductivity data , and argue that differences are due to the coulomb interaction . to estimate the strength of the coulomb interaction we use a hartree - fock approximation and calculate the optical conductivity of the jahn - teller plus coulomb system .",
    "the optical conductivity of @xmath0 was previously calculated by solovyev _",
    "et al._@xcite and by terakura _",
    "et al._@xcite using the lda method , but they did not consider the temperature dependence , or present information about the dependence of the observed conductivity on parameters .",
    "when we calculate using parameters tuned to give similar band gaps , we find the maximum conductivity is factor of 2 - 3 larger than the result in ref . and 4 times than in ref .",
    "the difference in absorption strength is not understood at present , but is discussed in more detail in section v , which shows that the error is unlikely to arise from the tight binding approach .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the hamiltonian , band structure , and the parameter determination , section iii gives the formulation of the optical conductivity , calculation results , and the comparison with experiments , section iv describes the effect of the coulomb interaction , section v discusses the accuracy of the approximation we have used , and section vi is the conclusion .",
    "at and below room temperature , @xmath0 exists in a distorted form of the @xmath16 perovskite structure . according to band theory calculations@xcite",
    "the conduction band is derived mainly from mn @xmath2 symmetry d - orbitals and is well separated from other bands .",
    "we find that the band structure appropriate to the ideal cubic @xmath16 perovskite structure may be well represented by the following tight binding model .",
    "@xmath17 here @xmath18 represents the coordinates of the mn sites ( which in the ideal structure are arranged in a simple cubic lattice ) , @xmath19,@xmath20 represent the two degenerate mn @xmath2 orbitals on a site , @xmath21 labels the nearest neighbors of a mn site , @xmath22 denotes the spin state , and @xmath23 is the hopping amplitude between orbital @xmath19 on site @xmath18 and @xmath20 on site @xmath24 .",
    "we choose @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the two linearly independent @xmath2 orbitals on a site .",
    "the hopping matrix @xmath23 has a special form : for hopping along the @xmath27 direction , it connects only the two @xmath28 states , thus @xmath29 the hopping matrices in the other bond directions are obtained by appropriate rotations and are @xmath30 as noted in the introduction , there is a substantial high energy ( @xmath12 8 ev ) photoemission evidence for strong on - site coulomb interactions in the manganites , which places them in the class of ` charge transfer ' materials .",
    "the relevance of the band theory calculation may therefore be questioned .",
    "we argue , however , that the effects of the interactions at the low(@xmath14 4 ev ) energies of interest may be determined by comparing the predictions of the band theory calculation to data ; the results we present will allow this comparison to be made .",
    "the high @xmath31 superconductors provide an instructive example . these are also charge transfer insulators with a very large high energy on - site repulsion @xmath32 ( ref . ) .",
    "the low energy excitations are complicated objects called zhang - rice singlets , but it has been established that the effective interaction relevant to the low energy theory is much less than @xmath32 , and that band theory(albeit with a renormalized hopping ) describes the electron dispersion well .",
    "we therefore suggest that band theory is an appropriate starting point in the manganite case as well .",
    "we now turn to the electron - lattice coupling . below 800 k",
    ", @xmath0 exists in a distorted form of the @xmath16 perovskite structure .",
    "the important distortion is a jahn - teller distortion in which mn - o bond lengths are changed in such a way that if we choose a mn site as an origin , the distortion is even - parity and the sum of the lengths of the 6 mn - o bonds is unchanged .",
    "this distortion lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath2 levels on a site . to represent this",
    "we define @xmath33 as the displacement along the _ a _ direction of an oxygen ion located between mn ions at @xmath18 and @xmath34 , and we define @xmath35 . the jahn - teller distortion term",

    "this distortion leads to a jahn - teller term of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the amplitudes of the staggered(@xmath37 ) and uniform(@xmath39 ) distortion respectively .",
    "we next consider the hund s coupling .",
    "this leads to a term @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the @xmath4 core spin and @xmath45 the pauli matrix . at @xmath46 = 0 k ,",

    ", the unit cell is doubled twice , once by spin and once by orbital ordering .",
    "we have two orbital states for each of the two spin states , and four mn sites per unit cell . due to the symmetry between two spin states , we will have two - fold degeneracy for each level . therefore , we have eight separate bands",
    ". the ground state is obtained by filling the energy levels below the chemical potential @xmath52 , which is determined to give the correct number of electrons per unit cell .",

    "( [ eq : tot ] ) is shown in fig . 1 for the parameters which provide the best fit to the published band calculations.@xcite crudely speaking",
    ", the bands fall into 4 pairs , which may be understood by setting @xmath55 ( as occurs at @xmath56 ) ; in this case we have four separate energy levels on each site : which are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "when we have non - zero @xmath61 , these levels split and become dispersive . in the low temperature ( 0,0,@xmath47 )",

    "recently , room temperature optical reflectivity spectra using a cleaved single crystal surface of @xmath177 have been measured by takenaka _",
    "et al._.@xcite although it is referred to as a single crystal , we believe that the sample of @xmath0 is micro - twined . in their results , the jahn - teller peak appears at around 2.5 ev , having maximum intensity around 600 @xmath174 with width around 1.5 ev , corresponding to @xmath178 0.141 ev , and the mn - o peak appears at 5 ev with maximum intensity 2800 @xmath179 .",
    "similar results were obtained by okimoto _",
    "et al._.@xcite takenaka _ et al .",
    "_ s results show a weak shoulder at 1.9 ev , which our model can not explain .    from fig .",
    "5(a ) , one sees that , if the jahn - teller interaction were the only important one , the observed lattice distortions would lead to a peak in @xmath180 at 1.2 ev with maximum intensity @xmath65 1200 @xmath174 , width @xmath181 1.0 ev , and @xmath182 0.223 ev . the maximum intensity or spectral weight is much larger than observed in either experiment and the peak position is lower . from fig .",
    "5(c ) , we see that the data of ref . may be approximately modeled by use of a stronger electron lattice coupling ( or larger amplitude lattice distortion ) , which moves the peak to higher energy and reduces its spectral weight . the data in ref .",
    "are very difficult to reconcile with theory , because as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(b ) , one can not simultaneously fit the peak amplitude and energy : choosing interaction parameters to fit the peak position leads to an amplitude , which is too large .",
    "the combination of peak energy and amplitude could only be explained if the actual hopping were rather smaller than the band theory value ( say @xmath183 0.4 ev rather than 0.6 ev ) .",
    "further optical data would be very desirable ( especially measurements at lower @xmath46 ) .",
    "for the present we assume the takenaka _",
    "s data are correct , and consider their interpretation in more detail .",
    "we believe that the combination of band calculation and estimates from the crystallography data adequately fix the magnitude of the jahn - teller splitting .",
    "we therefore believe that the differences between the takenaka _",
    "data and fig .",
    "5(a ) are mainly due to the coulomb interaction whose effects we study in the next section .",
    "we now add an on - site hubbard - type coulomb repulsion to our hamiltonian .",
    "because we have 2 orbital and 2 spin states on each site , we have in principle 6 different coulomb repulsion terms , which may be generally written ( @xmath184 is the density operator ) @xmath185    for simplicity we study this hamiltonian in the hartree - fock approximation , which we believe is reasonably accurate for the simple quantities ( peak position and spectral weight ) important for our analysis .",
    "corrections to the hartree - fock approximation are due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "we have compared hartree - fock to exact results for the case of strongest fluctuations , namely the one - dimensional hubbard model , and find agreement to within 30% for spectral weight@xcite ( peak positions are not available ) .",
    "we believe that in the case of present interest , the combination of three dimensionality , the large core spins , and the localization due to the electron - phonon interaction renders the hartree - fock approximation sufficiently accurate .    in the approximation ,",
    "one of the two density operators is replaced by its expectation value , which is determined self - consistently .",
    "the approximation explicitly breaks symmetry in spin and orbital space , so the issue of basis choice arises .",
    "we choose the orbital basis picked out by the observed lattice distortion and the spin basis picked out by the magnetic ordering .",
    "we refer the higher and lower lying orbital states by + and @xmath186 respectively , and the spin states by @xmath145 and @xmath146 defined previously .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian may then be written as @xmath187 where @xmath188 = @xmath189 + @xmath190 + @xmath191 , etc ..    eq .",
    "( [ eq : hu ] ) may be reorganized into a term proportional to the total @xmath2 density operator , which renormalizes the chemical potential and is of no interest , a term which couples to the total @xmath2 spin operator and changes the hund s coupling , and terms which renormalize the local jahn - teller splitting in a manner which differs for electrons locally parallel and antiparallel to the core spin .",
    "therefore , @xmath192 can be cast into the following form .",
    "@xmath193 where @xmath194",
    "because the hopping matrices are defined in @xmath195 and @xmath196 orbital basis , we need to transform the basis . for this purpose",
    ", it turns out useful to define @xmath197 if we transform into @xmath50 space in @xmath195 and @xmath196 basis , we obtain the hamiltonian to calculate optical conductivity .",
    "details are shown in the appendix c along with the expression of the number operators .",
    "as the simplest case , we consider the case where @xmath198 , independent of @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "for this case , we use @xmath61 , @xmath5 , and @xmath62 obtained previously and determine the values of @xmath6 by calculating optical conductivity at @xmath46=300 k and comparing with experimental jt peak position .",
    "for the jt peak at 2.5 ev in takenaka _",
    "s results , we obtain @xmath6=1.6 ev . the obtained value of @xmath6 is close to the difference of the experimental peak position and the calculated peak position for the @xmath6=0 case . the room temperature results are shown in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(d ) .",
    "as we increase the value of @xmath6 , the peak position shifts upwards by @xmath65 @xmath6 , and the peak intensity decreases . for @xmath6=1.6 ev",
    ", the calculated maximum peak intensity is 730 @xmath179 , width 1.2 ev , and @xmath201 0.145 ev . therefore , the calculated spectral weight is close to the observed spectral weight . with these determined values of @xmath6 , we calculate @xmath46=0 k results shown in figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(c ) , from which we can see the anisotropy and temperature dependence of optical conductivity .    in the no - hopping case ,",
    "the energy levels on each site are @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 .",
    "even though the finite hopping gives dispersion to the energy levels , the peak positions are close to the energy differences between different levels .",
    "therefore , the jt peak position is close to @xmath206 , the hund peak position is close to @xmath207 , and the jt+hund peak position is close to @xmath208 . to see the effect of different type of coulomb interaction and other parameters , we use different values of @xmath209 , @xmath210 and calculate optical conductivities without changing the value of @xmath211 .",
    "we observe that the jt peak position and spectral weight do not change very much .",
    "therefore even if we use a more general coulomb interaction , with @xmath212 dependent on the indices , as far as we fix the jt peak position by fixing @xmath211 , its spectral weight does not change very much .    for the above model",
    ", we also calculate the variation of the level occupancies as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the results for the lowest lying orbital @xmath213 are shown in fig . 7 for @xmath46=0 k and @xmath46=300 k , which shows that as @xmath6 increases , the @xmath2 electrons are more likely to have spins parallel to the core spins and stay in the ground state of the local lattice distortion .",
    "the curves however show that the value of @xmath6 required to fit takenaka _",
    "et al . _ s data",
    "does not change the ground state occupancy much .",
    "terakura _ et al . _ have calculated the @xmath46=0 k optical conductivity using optical matrix elements and energies obtained from their lsda band calculation . @xcite their conductivity is strikingly different from ours in two respects .",
    "first , the form is different : the sharp peaks we find are absent in their calculation .",
    "we suspect that the difference is due in large part to the 0.01 ry @xmath214 0.14 ev level broadening employed in ref . .",
    "figure 8 shows the effect of introducing an artificial broadening , @xmath108 , into our calculation ; the result is to be compared with fig .",
    "this figure shows that as broadening is increased , the peaks diminish in amplitude and become more symmetrical ( although there is always more asymmetry in our calculation than in ref . ) .",
    "particularly , the hund peak in @xmath127 is expected to have additional broadening of about 0.17 ev as mentioned in section iii .",
    "therefore , if we include 0.01 ry broadening assumed in ref . , the total broadening for the hund peak in @xmath127 will be @xmath215 0.3 ev , which explains the absence of this peak feature in ref . .",
    "therefore , we believe the level broadening along with the presence , in the calculation of ref .  , of other bands , accounts for the difference in line shape .",
    "a far more serious discrepancy is the difference in spectral weights .",
    "the area under the lowest conductivity peak in ref .",
    "is about a factor of 4 smaller than in our calculation .",
    "this difference seems not to be caused by a trivial error : in our calculation , the kinetic energies obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ke ] ) , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) ( i.e. , direct integration of @xmath94 ) , or from the hellman - feynman theorem agree . according to hellman - feynman theorem",
    ", @xmath216 can be found from the ground state energy @xmath217 by @xmath218 where @xmath63 is the hopping parameter defined in section ii . at @xmath46=0 k , we have calculated @xmath219 as the sum of energies of the filled bands , @xmath220\\ ] ] and evaluated @xmath221 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hellman ] ) .",
    "the result obtained in this way is consistent with the results in table i.    we examine the size of the possible error due to the following two approximations we have made : first , we have assumed that the hopping between mn ions , which originates from mn - o hopping , can be effectively represented without explicit consideration of o band .",
    "second , we have used tight binding approximation .    to study the effects of mn - o hybridization on the conductivity in the dominantly mn bands , we consider a simple model of a 1-d mn - o chain along @xmath167 direction .",
    "each unit cell contains one mn ion at position @xmath222 with a d - orbital represented by @xmath223 , and one oxygen ion at position @xmath224 with a p - orbital represented by @xmath225 .",
    "we consider a mn - o hopping of magnitude @xmath226 and choose sign to reflect the symmetry of the o p - orbital ( the sign can be removed by change of k space origin ) .",
    "in addition , to model the jahn - teller distortion , we consider alternating periodic potential @xmath227 on the mn site .",
    "we represent the energy of the d - level relative to the p - level by @xmath228 . for simplicity",
    "we assume spinless electrons .",
    "this can be represented by the following hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath229 we obtain the exact band structure and optical conductivity and compare this to the band structure and conductivity obtained from nearest - neighbor tight - binding fit to the two uppermost ( mn - dominant ) bands .",
    "the difference turns out small .",
    "the effective tight binding hamiltonian is @xmath230 by transforming into @xmath50 space , we can find band structure for @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the band structure of @xmath232 is simply given by @xmath233 for given @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 , we can fit the band structure of @xmath232 to that of @xmath231 to determine @xmath234 and @xmath235 .    for @xmath226=2.0 ev , @xmath227=1.0 ev",
    ", we try @xmath228 = 1.0 ev and 10 ev .",
    "the obtained d - bands are shown in figs .",
    "9(a ) and 9(b ) ( @xmath228=1.0 ev and 10 ev , respectively ) as solid lines , along with the best tight binding fit as dotted lines .",
    "fitted parameter values are @xmath234 = 0.88 ev , @xmath235 = 0.59 ev for @xmath228=1.0 ev , and @xmath234=0.35 ev , @xmath235=0.93 ev for @xmath228=10 ev .",
    "it shows that when @xmath228 = 1.0 ev , the fitting has error of 10 % of d - band width ( comparable to the error in the fits used in section ii - iv ) , but when @xmath228=10 ev , the fitting has negligible error .",
    "for these two cases , we assume half filling , and calculate optical conductivities shown in figs . 9(c ) and 9(d ) .",
    "the insets show the integrated spectral weight , @xmath236 . in this calculation",
    ", we assumed the mn - mn distance is @xmath71=4.034 @xmath67 , and the cross sectional area perpendicular to the direction of the chain is @xmath237 .",
    "for @xmath228 = 10 ev , the two calculations give almost identical results . for @xmath228=1.0",
    "ev , the tight binding fit has about 25 % larger spectral weight .",
    "we therefore expect our mn - only approximation yields errors @xmath65 25 % .    next ,",
    "to estimate the error of the tight binding approximation ( i.e. , of the peierls approximation to the optical matrix elements ) , we consider the following kronig - penney model . @xmath238",
    "\\label{eq : kp}\\ ] ] where @xmath239 , @xmath240 0 , @xmath241=@xmath242=@xmath243=1 , and spinless electrons are assumed for simplicity .",
    "once the values of @xmath239 and @xmath244 are given , we can find the band structure , the eigenstates @xmath245 , and the optical conductivity , and compare this to the peierls approximation .",
    "the band structure has two bands ; at n=1/2 , one is filled and the other is empty .",
    "therefore , we can calculate the optical conductivity via @xmath246 ^ 2 + \\epsilon^2 } , \\ ] ] where 1 and 2 are the band indices . for @xmath247 , @xmath248 , we calculate the exact band structure , shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) along with the best tight binding fit from eq . ( [ eq : tb ] ) ( @xmath234=1.33 , @xmath235=0.6 ) .",
    "it shows that the error is about 7 % of the total band width .",
    "figure 10(b ) shows the calculated optical conductivity for the exact k - p model and tight binding fit . the spectral weight of the tight binding fit is about 20 % larger than that of exact result , as shown in the inset .    in our calculation of optical conductivity ,",
    "our band fitting has error about 0.2 ev , which corresponds to about 5 % of total mn @xmath249 band width .",
    "so , we expect our approximation has similar size error in spectral weight as the two cases considered above .",
    "therefore , we expect that our calculated optical conductivity may have overestimated spectral weight by about 20 % , but not 400 % . therefore , we believe that within this error , our approximations are valid .    the relation between the kinetic energy and the optical spectral weight follows from the two assumptions of gauge invariance and reasonably localized d - electron wave functions .",
    "the success of the tight binding fit confirms this localized character .",
    "a tight binding parameterization of the band structure has been used to study @xmath250 in other correlated electron contexts,@xcite and works well in high @xmath9 case .",
    "the apparent discrepancy found here for the manganite , is an important issue for future research .",
    "we have calculated the optical conductivity of @xmath0 and have shown that the available data are consistent with the band theory estimation for hopping parameter and @xmath2 level splitting .",
    "our main prediction for the change in functional form and magnitude of @xmath94 as @xmath46 is decreased below @xmath251 is contained in fig .",
    ". experimental determination of the hund s coupling as well as final validation of the model must await definitive measurements of the magnitude and temperature dependence of @xmath250 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we comment on the implications of our results .",
    "first , we note that the estimate of the electron - lattice coupling derived from band theory is in good agreement with that derived directly from crystallography data .",
    "second , we observe that the electron - lattice interaction by itself does not account for the magnitude of the gap or the spectral weight in the absorption spectrum . a coulomb interaction @xmath6 @xmath65 1.6 ev is also required .",
    "this value puts @xmath0 in the weak - intermediate coupling range : the coulomb interaction is approximately 40% of the full band width 6 @xmath252 3.6 ev . in the simple one - band hubbard model , a coulomb interaction of this size ( relative to the band width )",
    "does not significantly affect properties ( such as optical spectral weights ) at reasonable dopings of order 0.2 or larger .",
    "the effects of this moderate coulomb coupling on properties of models of doped manganites deserve further attention .",
    "many authors have argued on the basis of photoemission data @xcite that the coulomb repulsion is large ( 5 - 10 ev ) ; however as noted by the experimentalists themselves , because the manganites are charge - transfer rather than mott - hubbard materials ( as are the high - tc superconductors ) the @xmath6 measured in photoemission is not directly relevant to the low ( @xmath14 4 ev ) energy physics of interest here .",
    "our data analysis focuses on robust features ( peak positions and spectral weights ) and is insensitive to the approximations we made .",
    "uncertainties in the tight binding parameterization of the band structure leads to an error@xmath65 0.2 ev in peak position , which is not important here ; the consistency of the peak position and spectral weights leads us to believe the band theory estimates of @xmath61 are reasonably accurate .",
    "uncertainties in the estimates of electron - phonon coupling @xmath5 could change our estimated coulomb repulsion by around 0.2 ev .",
    "we note however that we have not included any excitonic effects arising from the first neighbor interactions such as those proposed by maekawa _",
    "et al._.@xcite at @xmath46=0 k , the two - dimensional character and general flatness of the bands suggest that these might be important and interesting to look for .    the crucial prediction of the present model is the dramatic change in optical absorption with temperature .",
    "this change is a robust feature of the model , and comes from a dramatic shift in spectral weight caused by ferromagnetic spin ordering , along with a very nearly two dimensional character of the bands at @xmath253 0 , caused by the between - planes antiferromagnetism .",
    "early data @xcite reported only a weak temperature dependence of the optical absorption ; if these data are reproduced , then our fundamental picture of the manganites based on @xmath2 electron with electron - lattice and electron - electron interactions must be modified .              without considering the coulomb repulsion , the effective total hamiltonian at @xmath46=300 k",
    "is given by the following expression .",
    "@xmath256 where @xmath257 @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath228 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 are defined in appendix a.      at @xmath46=0 k , the total mean field hamiltonian with the coulomb interaction , @xmath262 has the same form as @xmath51 in the appendix a with @xmath263 , @xmath264 and the following additional term .",
