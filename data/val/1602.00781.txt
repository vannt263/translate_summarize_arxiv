    "entanglement , the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics  @xcite , has appealed widespread attention and interest in different branches of physics and become the essential resource for many quantum information processes  @xcite . up to now , entanglement has been successfully prepared and manipulated in variously microscopic system theoretically and experimentally , such as atoms  @xcite , photons@xcite , ions  @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , it is not yet completely clear that to what degree quantum mechanics is suitable for mesoscopic and macroscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the preparation of entanglement in mesoscopic and macroscopic systems should not be violated in principle  @xcite , but quantum phenomena such as quantum entanglement commonly does not present in the macroscopic world resulting form the environment - induced decoherence .",
    "so many scientists tried their best to observe the novel phenomena of obtaining quantum entanglement at the mesoscopic and macroscopic level over the last decades .",
    "fortunately , due to the theoretical investigation and the advancement of experimental techniques , obtaining and observing entanglement in mesocopic and even macroscopic systems have become possible .    with the fast - developing field of microfabrication and nanotechnology , cavity optomechanical system is being one of the most appealing and promising candidates as an ideal system for the study of fundamental quantum physics , such as macroscopic quantum phenomena , decoherence , and quantum - classical boundary  @xcite .",
    "its standard model consists of a fabry - prot cavity with a fixed partially transmitting mirror and one movable perfectly reflecting mirror .",
    "when the fabry - prot cavity is coherently driven by an external laser field , the movable mirror will be shifted from its equilibrium position and free to move along the cavity axis due to the radiation pressure force and its center - of - mass motion can be modelled as a mechanical harmonic oscillator .",
    "since the mechanical harmonic oscillator resembles a prototype of classical systems  @xcite , cavity optomechanical system provides a unique platform for exploring the novel quantum phenomena at the mesoscopic and macroscopic level such as optomechanical entanglement . in recent years",

    "the entanglement between the different optical and mechanical modes in an array of three coupled optomechanical cavities was considered and the dynamics of such a setup showed that intracavity optomechanical entanglement generated independently in each cavity can be distributed pairwise between intercavity photons as well as phonons  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the scheme for entangling two macroscopic mechanical resonators ( movable mirrors ) by their coupling to the two - mode fields of a correlated - emission laser inside a doubly resonant cavity was proposed  @xcite , showing that the steady - state entanglement of two mirrors as well as that of two - mode fields can be obtained in the regime of strong field - mirror coupling when the input lasers are scattered at the anti - stokes sidebands . in 2014 , liao _ et al .",

    "we propose a scheme for the creation of robust entanglement between a movable mirror and atomic ensemble at the macroscopic level in coupled optomechanical system . in the scheme , with the increase of the coupling strength of the coupled optomechanical system , not only",
    "the entanglement is increasingly stronger but also the effective detuning is more and more broader , which are extremely significant due to the fact that the stronger entanglement and the more broader effective detuning are obtained , the more easily it is realized and observed in experiment . in the meanwhile ,",

    "this inequality equation requires that all the symplectic eigenvalues of the transposed matrix to be larger than 1/2 .",
    "so if the smallest eigenvalues is less than 1/2 , the transposed modes are inseparable , i.e. , there exists entanglement between the modes .",
    "we introduce the logarithmic negativity to quantify the entanglement which can be computed by means of a process known as symplectic diagonalization of submatrix @xmath97 , where the entanglement properties are characterized in the symplectic eigenvalues of the diagonalized matrix .",

    "3 . as clearly presented in fig .  3 , due to the environment - induced decoherence , the intensity of the mirror - atomic ensemble entanglement decreases and eventually vanishes with the rise of environmental temperature . with the increase of coupling strength @xmath2 , the critical value of temperature @xmath126 ( @xmath126 is defined as @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) increases . when the coupling strength is set @xmath129 ,",
    "the critical value of temperature @xmath126 of the mirror - atomic ensemble entanglement persists for 32 k , which is several orders of magnitude larger than the ground state temperature of the mechanical oscillator and is higher than that in refs .",
    "therefore , it is easier and more feasible to be realized and observed from the experimental point view .",
    "[ fig4 ]    secondly , we investigate the stationary entanglement of the three possible bipartite subsystems in terms of the logarithmic negativity @xmath117 .",
    "we denote the logarithmic negativities for the cavity 1-mirror , cavity 2-mirror , and atomic ensemble - mirror as @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "the bipartite entanglements between the cavity 1-cavity 2 , cavity 1-atomic ensemble , and cavity 2-atomic ensemble are so weak that there is no need to consider them .",
    "the results on the behavior of the bipartite entanglement are shown in fig .  4 in which we plot three bipartite logarithmic negativities @xmath130(black curves ) , @xmath131(red curves ) , and @xmath132(blue curves ) versus the normalized dutuning @xmath121 at a fixed temperature of @xmath47=400 mk for four different coupling strengths .",
    "it is evident that there is a sort of entanglement transfer among the three bipartite subsystems , i.e. , the bipartite entanglements @xmath130 and @xmath132 increase while the bipartite entanglement @xmath131 decreases with the increase of coupling strength @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , the enhancement of the entanglements between cavity 1 and mirror and atomic ensemble and mirror at the expense of the entanglement between cavity 2 and mirror .",
    "it is remarkable that , therefore , the indirectly coupled entanglement ( @xmath130 and @xmath132 ) transfers with the directly coupled entanglement ( @xmath131 ) each other with the increase of coupling strength @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the above discussion the effect of the entanglement transfer among the three bipartite subsystems is predominant when the atoms are resonant with the stokes sideband ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "moreover , we notice that atomic ensemble - mirror entanglement is not present at @xmath134 , which is due to the fact that the entanglement is mostly carried by the cavity 1-mirror and cavity 2-mirror .    in above discussion , we assume that the average number of atoms in the excited state is much smaller than the number of total atoms . here",
    "we discuss the limits of validity of the model .",
    "the bosonic description of the atomic polarization is valid only when the single - atom excitation probability , @xmath135 , is much smaller than 1  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the linearization of the quantum langevin equations is valid when the intracavity fields have a large amplitude at the steady state , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the above two conditions are simultaneously satisfied only when @xmath136 .",
    "this means requiring a very weak atom - cavity coupling .",
    "but if we consider a relatively small cavity mode volume ( @xmath137 @xmath138 ) , in this case , @xmath20 is not very weak when we consider a standard optical dipole transition .",
    "however , the required weak - coupling condition can still be achieved  @xcite .",
    "we now address the experimental issues .",
    "the detection of the generated entanglement at the macroscopic level in optomechanical systems is still an experimental challenge .",
    "however , for the detection of the entanglement , we have to measure the quadrature correlations  @xcite and quantum correlation detection is relatively easy in optomechanical systems .",
    "recently , several promising programs have been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , so we can exploit homodyne measurement experimental techniques to detect quantum correlations so as to detect the indirectly coupled quantum entanglement .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme to create robust entanglement between a movable mirror and atomic ensemble at the macroscopic level in coupled optomechanical system . with the increase of the coupling strength of the coupled optomechanical system , the stronger entanglement and the broader effective detuning",
    "can be obtained , so it is easier and more feasible to realize and observe this sort of novel phenomena in experiment .",
    "utilizing experimentally accessible parameters , the critical temperature of the bipartite continuous variable entanglement in our scheme can approach to 32 k , much higher than that in refs .",
