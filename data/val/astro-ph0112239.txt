    "on april 18 , 2001 at 07:55:11.509 ut the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm , 40 - 700 kev ) onboard bepposax was triggered by a large flare .",
    "the event was also observed by the unit 1 of the bepposax wide field cameras ( wfcs , 2 - 28 kev ) , that was automatically shut - down few seconds after the start of the event by an onboard safeguard algorithm .",
    "the wfc localized this giant flare as originating from the soft gamma - ray repeater sgr 1900 + 14 .    the bepposax grbm unit 1 ,",
    "co - aligned to wfc unit 1 , detected a peak flux of 16,400 counts / s ( 40 - 700 kev , after deadtime correction ) , corresponding to ( 1.1@xmath00.1)@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "the event lasted approximately 40  s , and the total fluence was about 240,000 counts .",
    "a 5-s periodic modulation of the light curve is consistent with the 5.17-s period of the persistent x - ray source . in the light curve of the flare",
    "we can identify the repetition of 5 or 6 cycles , and a last pulse that is out of phase with respect to the previous ones . assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral shape , from our 2-channel , 1-s resolved spectrum",
    ", we can derive a plasma temperature kt of @xmath430  kev .",
    "there is no evidence for a hard spike at the start of the event , and the spectral evolution during the event is relatively smooth , with a general hardening trend .",
    "the konus - wind instrument detected this event in the non - trigger mode because of very high background level after strong solar flare ( 30 times more than normal ) .",
    "our estimation for energy more than 15 kev is : fluence - 2@xmath510@xmath6 erg @xmath2 and peak flux - 2.5@xmath510@xmath7 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 . in spite of rough time resolution in the background mode",
    "the konus - wind data has evidences of the 5-s pulsations .",
    "three weak and short bursts are detected at times 2537 , 755 and 444 seconds _ before _ the giant flare in the wfc unit 1 .",
    "their durations are 100 , 125 and 55 ms , and their peak fluxes exceed 20 crab units in 2 - 28 kev ( feroci et al . 2001b ) .",
    "no gamma - ray counterpart was found for these events in the grbm , nor in _ ulysses _ or konus / wind .",
    "this is the first reported bursting activity from sgr 1900 + 14 since approximately two years .    at the time of the giant flare , as detected by the grbm ,",
    "the wfc1 detected a large increase in the count rate for approximately 3 seconds after the grbm trigger . at this time",
    "the count rate was so high ( larger than 30,000 counts / s ) that it triggered the automatic turn off of the experiment .",
    "the april 18 2001 activity of sgr 1900 + 14 allowed us to activate our target of opportunity observation program with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfi , 0.1 - 300 kev ) .",
    "thanks to the remarkable effort by the mission scientist team , the mission planners team and our team , the first follow - up observation was started on april 18 at 15:10 ut , less than 8 hours after the event .",
    "this first observation ( feroci et al .",
    "2001c ) was 28 hours long , for a net exposure time in the mecs instrument of 60 ks .",
    "a second pointing was carried out on april 29 at 20:20 ut , for a similar exposure time .",
    "the persistent x - ray counterpart of sgr 1900 + 14 was detected in both observations .",
    "the source emitted a large number of short x - ray bursts during the first observation , whereas in the second pointing only one burst was detected .",
    "the average spectrum during the first pointing , after removal of the bursts , can be fit with a power law with photon index 2.6@xmath00.1 and n@xmath8=(4.3@xmath00.3)@xmath9 @xmath2 .",
    "the persistent 2 - 10 kev flux showed a rapid decaying behaviour during our first pointing , going approximately from 3.5 to 2@xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( unabsorbed ) . using the x - ray flux in the same band provided by the chandra observation carried out on april 22 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "2001 ) , we obtain that the time behaviour of the x - ray flux can be described by a power law , with index @xmath4 - 0.6 .",
    "interestingly , studying the hardness ratio between the 1.6 - 4 kev and the 4 - 10 kev energy ranges , we find a clear correlation flux vs. hardness , indicating that the spectrum softens when the persistent flux decreases .    during our second observation the source appeared to have gone back to its quiescent status .",
    "removing the single burst that we observed , the 0.1 - 10 kev energy spectrum is best fit by the sum of an absorbed power law plus a blackbody with temperature @xmath40.5 kev .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev flux is consistent with the ` standard ' quiescent status , at @xmath41.1@xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( unabsorbed ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the plot of the x - ray flux vs. time , including also the chandra point , that suggests that the source returned to its quiescent status in less than 3 days after the burst .",
    "we performed a period search in both nfi observations and found the expected 5.17-s periodicity in the 2 - 10 kev flux from the persistent source . in the first observation",
    "the best period was 5.17277 s , with a smooth sinusoidal profile . in the second pointing the period increased to 5.17298 s , without significant differences in the pulse profile .",
    "therefore , the period derivative between the two bepposax observation is about 2.3@xmath11 s s@xmath3 .",
    "the bepposax instrumentation observed the most interesting phases of the 2001 activation of sgr 1900 + 14 with a very complete set of observations .",
    "the grbm and wfc caught the second giant flare in the ( observed ) history of this source and its precursor x - ray activity .",
    "the nfi observed the afterglow of the persistent source after the flare , the bursting activity and its quenching , and the period history soon after the giant flare .",
    "the giant flare is rather unusual with respect to its two predecessors , the march 5 1979 event from sgr 0526 - 66 and the august 27 1998 flare from sgr 1900 + 14 ( e.g. , mazets et al . 1979 , hurley et al . 1999 , feroci et al .",
    "the most important differences in the april 18 are in the following aspects :    * the peak flux and fluence are more than one order of magnitude smaller * the duration is almost one order of magnitude shorter * there is no evidence for the first short and very hard pulse at the beginning of the event , implying that , contrary to the other two events , most likely there was no relativistic particle emission during this event .",
    "the nfi observation is the fastest pointing after a giant flare and provides a _ direct _ observation of a long - duration afterglow emission from an sgr after a giant flare .",
    "our result of an afterglow showing a power law decay , with index -0.6 , is similar to that obtained by woods et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who measured a decay index of -0.713@xmath00.025 after the august 27 event , based on the assumed constancy of the pulsed fraction .",
    "interestingly , ibrahim et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found a similar decay law in the pulsating soft tail of the august 29 short burst .",
    "the spectral variability of the x - ray afterglow is also interesting . during our first observation , at high flux level ,",
    "the source spectrum showed a softening , and an overall power law shape . in our second observation , at a flux typical of the quiescent state , we clearly detect the emergence of a kt=0.5 kev blackbody component , and an n@xmath8 smaller by about a factor of 2 . based on our observations , together with our analysis of the previous bepposax observations",
    "( see also woods et al . 1999 , 2001 ) of this source in quiescence ( may 1997 and march / april 2000 ) and after the august 27 giant flare ( september 1998 ) , we can state that the blackbody component for this source is peculiar of its quiescent state .",
    "we warmly thank l. piro , g. gandolfi , l. salotti , m. capalbi , l. amati , the bepposax mission planners , the bepposax soc , occ and sdc for their personal efforts that allowed a fast repointing of the source after the flare , as well as a prompt analysis of the grbm , wfc and nfi data .",
