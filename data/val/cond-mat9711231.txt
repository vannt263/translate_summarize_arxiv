    "the recent advances in the generation and manipulation of samples of ultracold atoms have stimulated research aimed at the development of sources of coherent atomic beams .",
    "recent mit experiments @xcite can be considered as the first demonstration of a pulsed atom laser .",
    "an important further goal is to achieve a cw system .",
    "several theoretical proposals to realize such a device have already been made .",
    "they can be separated into two categories : in the first one , the population of the atom laser mode results from optical cooling - like processes such that electronically excited atoms undergo a transition to the atom laser mode via spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "proposals in the second category @xcite rely on binary collisions between ground state atoms fed into an intermediary level of the atom resonator .",
    "these collisions are such that one of the atoms undergoes a transition into the laser mode and the other into a heavily damped mode .",
    "this latter atom rapidly escapes the cavity , thereby providing the irreversibility of the pumping process .    amongst of the most important characteristics of a laser",
    "are the coherence properties of its output . in the context of cw atom lasers ,",
    "this aspect has been addressed in a number of articles : refs .",
    "@xcite investigate various output coupling schemes and their effect on the laser linewidth .",
    "they show that a narrow linewidth can be achieved by a suitable choice of outcoupling setup .",
    "however , the details of the internal dynamics of the atom laser have not been taken into account so far in that work .",
    "in contrast , refs .  @xcite consider the correlation functions for a three - mode model of a binary - collision atom laser , modeling the output mechanism simply as linear damping .",
    "these studies show that the elastic atomic collisions which occur in addition to the pumping collisions impose severe limitations on the coherence of the laser output . finally , estimates of the linewidth of an atom laser based on optical cooling are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to extend the previous work on the phase dynamics of a binary collision atom laser .",
    "we describe this system in terms of a three - mode scheme which ignores most of the multitude of atomic cavity levels and takes into account only those modes that are essential for the lasing process , i.  e.  the pump , laser mode and loss mode .",
    "the feeding and loss processes are described by linear coupling to external continua .",
    "several reasons motivate our interest in the binary collision atom laser and in this particular model .",
    "first , and in contrast to the optical pumping approach , evaporative cooling has already demonstrated its value in achieving bec @xcite .",
    "the binary collision model we consider can be seen as the simplest possible caricature of this mechanism .",
    "second , an interesting proposal has recently been made to overcome some of the problems associated with elastic binary collisions @xcite in case they result from the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms : by taking advantage of specifically designed optical cavities , it is possible to greatly decrease the rate of elastic collisions between laser mode atoms .",
    "it is of interest to examine the resulting influence on the laser linewidth .",
    "third , the binary collision atom lasers can be analyzed within the framework of few - mode models in more detail and more easily than the models based on optical cooling .",
    "an additional justification for studying such rudimentary models lies in the fact that they give a good theoretical understanding of the fundamental way an atom laser might generically work . as such",
    ", they provide valuable complementary insights to more realistic approaches , e.g.  the quantum kinetic theory of bec which may also be applied to atom lasers @xcite . finally , before including the effects of more sophisticated output coupling schemes it is important to gain a thorough understanding of the internal laser dynamics and its impact on the laser linewidth in simple models .",
    "after briefly reviewing the main aspects of binary collisions atom laser schemes in section ii , the present paper addresses two main topics : section iii discusses the laser linewidth and its dependence on elastic atom - atom collisions . in previous studies",
    "this question was either treated rather briefly @xcite or estimates were given @xcite the validity of which is not quite clear @xcite .",
    "our analysis leads to an analytical approximation for the laser linewidth in the presence of interatomic collisions . to this end a linearized fluctuation analysis of the system master equation is performed after adiabatically eliminating the loss mode .",
    "the results of this analysis are compared to quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "we illustrate these results in the determination of the possible operating regimes of the atom laser of refs .",
    "@xcite , and demonstrate that in for weak pumping it should in principle be possible to obtain laser linewidths below the natural linewidth of the laser mode .    in section",
    "iv we turn to the question of whether a definite relative phase can be established between independent atom lasers .",
    "the same question , but for bose - einstein condensates , has aroused much interest recently @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for a system of two condensates with a fixed total number of atoms , a relative phase is established by the process of measurement .",
    "our analysis extends this work to the realm of open systems .",
    "we show that a relative phase can be established in single runs of the experiment in very much the same way as for bose condensates .",
    "the study of the diffusion properties of this relative phase shows its close connection to the phase of the single atom laser as described in terms of stochastic processes .",
    "finally , a brief summary and conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the basic principles of operation of the binary collision atom laser are discussed in detail in several publications @xcite .",
    "one considers a resonator for atoms , realized e.g. by optical fields . in order to concentrate on the essential dynamics",
    "only three out of the multitude of atomic center - of - mass modes are taken into account explicitly ( cf .",
    "[ fig21 ] ) .",
    "bosonic atoms in their ground electronic state are pumped into an atomic resonator level of `` intermediary '' energy ( mode 1 ) .",
    "they then undergo binary collisions which take one of the atoms involved to the tightly bound laser mode 0 , whereas the other one is transferred to the heavily damped loss mode 2 .",
    "this latter atom leaves the resonator quickly , thereby providing the irreversibility of the pumping process .",
    "a macroscopic population of the laser mode can built up as soon as the influx of atoms due to pumping compensates for the losses induced by the damping .    in the description of this laser scheme one",
    "has to take into account that in addition to the pumping collisions other types of interatomic collisions can also occur .",
    "these considerations lead to an ansatz for the atom laser master equation of the form @xmath0+\\kappa_0{\\cal d}[a_0]w+\\kappa_1(n+1){\\cal d } [ a_1]w \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\kappa_1 n { \\cal d}[a_1^{\\dagger}]w + \\kappa_2{\\cal d}[a_2]w\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 . in this equation",
    ", we use the second quantized formalism in which each center - of - mass atomic mode is associated with an annihilation operator @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denotes the atomic density operator .",
    "the free hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 @xmath5 being the mode frequencies .",
    "the general form of the collision hamiltonian can be written as @xmath6 with @xmath7 the matrix elements of the two - body interaction hamiltonian responsible for the collisions . however , for the present purposes it will be sufficient to restrict our attention to the reduced form @xmath8 in which ( besides the pumping collisions ) only those collisions are retained which are expected to have the most significant influence on the phase dynamics .",
    "the damping rates of the cavity modes are given by the coefficients @xmath9 , and the strength of the external pumping of mode 1 is characterized by the parameter @xmath10 , which is the mean number of atoms to which mode 1 would equilibrate in the absence of collisions .",
    "the superoperator @xmath11 is of the lindblad form and is defined by @xmath12 p = cpc^{\\dagger}-\\textstyle{\\frac 1 2}(c^{\\dagger } c p - p c^{\\dagger } c)\\ ] ] with arbitrary operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that it is useful to study this system in detail although it might be thought of more as a caricature than as an approximation , due to the neglect of most of the modes in the atomic resonator . from this point of view , its main purpose is to give a basic understanding of the laser dynamics , rather than a detailed quantitative description of a realistic setup .",
    "however , recent work has added significantly more substance to this model @xcite : it was shown that in case the binary collisions result from the dipole - dipole interaction and for a quasi one - dimensional modulated cavity , a high mode selectivity for the atomic collisions can be obtained .",
    "one particular pumping mode is then coupled only to a small number of other modes . among the small set of initially populated low - lying modes , a particular one",
    "is then expected to be singled out as a result of mode competition .",
    "another benefit of this model is the fact that due to the dipole - dipole selection rules in the resonator , the strength @xmath15 of detrimental collisions can be made small in comparison to @xmath16 . in that proposal ,",
    "an efficient pumping process is achieved by a time - dependent modulation of the atom cavity . in the spirit of this model we set @xmath17 in the following .    in order to achieve a sufficiently high degree of irreversibility",
    "it is necessary that @xmath18 is much larger than the damping rates of the other modes .",

    "can easily be solved numerically using standard quantum monte carlo simulation techniques @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we only recall that these simulations are significantly facilitated by the fact that between quantum jumps the total number of atoms is conserved . in this way",
    "one has to propagate only a small number of actually populated states , a situation evidently advantageous with regard to both memory and cpu time requirements one normally has to evolve four wave functions @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 if one uses the method of ref .",
    ". however , due to the conservation of atom number in this case the contributions from @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the time development of @xmath31|\\phi(t)\\rangle$ ] can be distinguished .",
    "this means that one obtains a contribution to the correlation function even from a single propagation . as it is more advantageous to average over a large number of different @xmath29 than to use many simulations for a small number of initial wave functions one obtains a significant additional decrease in computation time . ] .",
    "in order to obtain an analytical approximation for the laser linewidth in the two - mode sytem a linearized fluctuation analysis can be performed @xcite . to this end the master equation ( [ al2 m ] ) is converted to a fokker - planck equation using the @xmath14-function representation as described in @xcite .",

    "one of the most important results of a systematic comparison between the predictions of the two - mode and the three - mode models is that in the presence of elastic collisions the equilibrium populations may react as least as sensitively to the effects of `` non - adiabaticity '' as the linewidth . in other words , as the values of @xmath16 and @xmath18 are lowered with @xmath125 fixed , @xmath40 can drop significantly below its adiabatic value even before the linewidth is considerably affected .",

    "it was shown that one needs not resort to the concept of spontaneously broken symmetry to model the creation of interference patterns .",
    "rather , these structures are brought about by the very act of observation : a sequence of measurements leads to the creation of an entangled state of the condensates pair which can be assigned a relative phase .",

    "the wave function @xmath142 can be expanded on these phase states as @xmath143 is given by @xmath144    several physical processes influence the phase distribution : they are ( i ) the loss processes induced by the action of the operators @xmath145 leading to the entanglement of the atom lasers ; ( ii ) the pumping into the laser modes described by the action of @xmath146 and @xmath147 ; ( iii ) the collision interactions taking place between quantum jumps and described by @xmath23 ; and ( iv ) the non - hermitian time evolution described by the @xmath125-term in eq .",
