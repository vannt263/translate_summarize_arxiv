    "interference of electrons that encircle a magnetostatic flux has been studied for a long time since the pioneering work of aharonov and bohm [ 1 ] .",
    "it has applications in various contexts , for example in conductance oscillations in mesoscopic rings [ 2 ] , neutron interferometry [ 3 ] , and ` which - path ' experiments [ 4 ] .",
    "a further development is the replacement of the magnetostatic flux with an electromagnetic field . in this case , the electrons feel not only the vector potential but the electromagnetic field .",
    "therefore , the objective in this ` ac aharonov - bohm ' effect is very different from the ` dc aharonov - bohm ' effect ( with magnetostatic flux ) . in the latter case",
    "the physical reality of the vector potential has been demonstrated and the subtleties of quantum mechanics in non - trivial topologies have been studied .",
    "the former case constitutes a non - linear device , where the interaction between the interfering electrons and the photons leads to interesting non - linear phenomena [ 5 ] like amplification and frequency conversion .",
    "indeed the non - linearity can be seen in the intensity of the interfering electrons which is a sinusoidal function of the time - dependent magnetic flux .",
    "our study is related to recent work on the interaction of mesoscopic devices with microwaves [ 6 ] .",
    "one step further in this line of work is to use in these experiments non - classical microwaves , where the quantum noise is carefully controlled . in this case",
    ", we can quantify how the quantum noise destroys slightly the electron interference [ 7 ] .",
    "more generally , we have here two coupled quantum systems ( photons and electrons ) and we can study how various quantum phenomena associated with the non - classical electromagnetic field cause corresponding quantum phenomena on the electrons .",
    "for example , we can study how the quantum statistics of photons affects the quantum statistics of the electrons ; how the entanglement of two - mode non - classical microwaves affects the electron interference ; etc .    in this paper",
    "we study how various types of non - classical microwaves affect both the average intensity and the spectral density of the interfering electrons .",
    "the results are compared with those for classical microwaves ( section ii ) .",
    "we also consider two - mode microwaves with frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 in section iii , where we show that we get different results for rational and irrational values of @xmath2 .",
    "we interpret these results in terms of emission and absorption of photons by the non - linear device of the interfering electrons .",
    "this discussion shows the potential use of the device for frequency conversion .",
    "two - mode microwaves can be factorizable , separable or entangled [ 8 ] .",
    "we study how such deep quantum phenomena in the microwaves can affect the electron interference .",
    "the problem is complex and it is approached through examples which demonstrate the effect . in particular , we compare and contrast the effect on electron interference , of an entangled microwave state with that of the corresponding separable microwave state .",
    "we conclude in section iv with a discussion of our results .",
    "interfering electric charges in mesoscopic devices that follow two different paths @xmath3 and @xmath4 are considered .",

    "the electric charges feel only a vector potential . in the ac aharonov - bohm experiment",
    "the electric charges also feel an electric field , which is induced according to faraday s law .",
