    "this physical quantity is conceptually important in physics . in particular , it is at the heart of the physics of bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity @xcite .",
    "the first most prominent application of the bogoliubov theory of elementary excitations was formulated by bogoliubov himself to qualitatively explain the superfluid behavior of strongly interacting quantum fluids like liquid helium @xcite . in this dense system",
