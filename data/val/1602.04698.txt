    "a total colouring of a simple graph is a simultaneous assignment of labels to its vertices and edges such that adjacent vertices get distinct colours , adjacent edges get distinct colours and the colour of each edge is distinct from the colours of its endpoint vertices ( or equivalently the colour of each vertex is distinct from the colours of its incident edges ) .",
    "it is thus a combination of a proper vertex colouring , a proper edge colouring and a further restriction on the interplay between these colourings .",
    "the notion of total colouring was introduced by behzad [ 2 ] and vizing [ 8 ] and those papers also conjectured that @xmath1 .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath2 , since a vertex of maximum degree and its incident edges must all get distinct colours .",
    "a lot of work has been done on total colouring , based on frugal colouring , the list colouring conjecture etc .    in this work",
    "our aim is not to make headway in the total colouring problem but rather to get a complete characterisation of the class of total graphs of simple graphs . towards this end , we of course need a precise definition of what we mean by the total graph of a given graph , which is an existing concept .",
    "this also brings along the concept of line graphs .",
    "the vertex set of the total graph of a simple graph can be partitioned into two sets , one corresponding to the vertex set of the original graph ( inverse total graph ) and the other the line graph of the original graph , with crossing edges between these two vertex sets .",
    "a result characterising total graphs was obtained by behzad [ 1 ] in 1970 , and earlier works obtained interesting properties on this class of graphs [ 4 ] .",
    "the fact that any total graph has a unique preimage under the inverse total graph operator was proved by [ 3 ] .",
    "we obtain a new characterisation of total graphs based on the induced subgraphs on the neighbourhood of maximum degree vertices .",
    "these characterisations allow us to distinguish vertex vertices from edge vertices among the vertices of maximum degree . using this characterisation",
    ", we develop an efficient algorithm which iteratively creates the partition of the vertex set of the candidate total graph into its inverse total graph and line graph .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "definitions and notation used in the paper are presented in section  [ secdefnnot ] .",
    "basic properties and theorems on total graphs are presented in section  [ sectotgraintro ] .",
    "section  [ sectotalcomplete ] presents our results for special classes , the most elegant among which is the explicit construction for complete graphs . in section  [ sectotgrachar ]",
    "we present our theorems characterising the two classes of vertices and develop our theorem into an algorithm for reconstructing the inverse total graph of a given total graph .",
    "we summarise our work and indicate possible future directions for research in section  [ secconcl ] .",
    "in this section we present the basic definitions and notation we use throughout the paper .",
    "all graphs we consider are finite , simple , undirected and connected .",
    "this problem for graphs with more than one component are strsaightforward extensions of the connected case .",
    "[ deflngr ] the * line graph * @xmath3 of a graph @xmath4 is defined as the graph with vertex set having one vertex corresponding to each edge in @xmath5 and an edge between two vertices of @xmath3 precisely when the edges of @xmath5 that those vertices correspond to , have a common endpoint .",
    "not all graphs are line graphs of a simple graph ( or for that matter even of a multigraph ) .",
    "the line graph of a graph is however well defined , and results in a unique graph .",
    "the concept of line graph can thus be viewed as a non - surjective function from the set of simple graphs to the set of simple graphs . when we limit attention to connected simple graphs , it is further known that this function is almost injective .",
    "there is only one pair of distinct graphs with the same line graph namely the three vertex cycle @xmath6 and the three leaf star @xmath7 both of whose line graphs are @xmath6 .",
    "thus it is an interesting question both combinatorially and algorithmically as to which graphs are line graphs of some simple graph , and computing the inverse - line graph ( the preimage under the line graph function ) for those graphs which are line graphs [ 6 ] iterating the line graph operator and its inverse , as well as properties of the resulting sequence of graphs has also been studied extensively in the literature [ 5][7 ]    an obvious application of the concept of line graphs is to translate edge colouring problems into equivalent vertex colouring problems on the line graph .",
    "similarly , we define the total graph of a graph . again",
    ", this transformation renders a total colouring problem on a graph into a vertex colouring problem on an equivalent graph .",
    "the total graph concept can also be viewed as a function from the class of graphs to the class of graphs .",
    "it has been established that the total graph viewed as a function from the class of graphs to the class of graphs is injective .",

    "the vertex set of a total graph @xmath11 has a partition into two disjoint sets , such that the induced subgraph on one part is the inverse total graph @xmath5 and the other is the line graph @xmath3 . in several total graphs ,",
    "this partitioning is non - unique , but the different partitions are all isomporphic to each other .",
    "these are called the vertex part and the edge part respectively . the bipartite subgraph induced by",
    "the division as above is 2-regular on vertices in the edge part .",
    "this is because each edge in the inverse total graph has precisely two endpoints .",
    "thus an algorithm for computing the inverse total graph of a given graph ( if it is a total graph ) is based on finding such a division or partition of the vertex set .",
    "[ thmmixedclq ] the largest mixed clique consisting of at least two vertex vertices is in a total graph is of size 3 .",
    "consider a clique consisting of three vertex vertices . clearly there is no edge in any graph incident to three distinct vertices .",
    "hence this clique can not be augmented to include any edge vertices , and thus is not the subset of any mixed clique .",
    "it follows that a mixed clique can consist of at most two adjacent vertex vertices . in this case",
    "this can be augmented by only one vertex , the edge vertex representing the link between these two adjacent vertex vertices .",
