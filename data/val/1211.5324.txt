    "[ fig : unchr_radial2 ] , and the energy again falls off more rapidly with increased @xmath30 .",
    "since the depths of minima and maxima of the surface charge distributions coincide for odd wave numbers and differ for even wave numbers , something similar is also observed in the interaction free energy when comparing different shell orientations . for odd @xmath30s",
    "the interaction energies in the minimum and maximum configuration mirror each other , even with changing separation , while for even @xmath30s the maximum of the interaction is usually somewhat larger than the minimum .",
    "for all the other orientations of the shells the energy falls in between the limits delineated by the minimal and maximal interaction , all the while keeping a monotonic behavior with respect to the intershell separation , i.e. being either purely repulsive or purely attractive .",
    "on addition of a homogeneous background charge we can study the interaction of two charged shells in the presence of local charge density variation .",
    "the shells are assumed equal in size and the interaction energy is then @xmath167 where @xmath30 is again chosen from the allowed wave numbers for a given symmetry .",
    "in addition to the parameters considered in the case of two neutral shells we can now modify the total charge on the shells by changing @xmath87 , and we can assume that the ratio @xmath142 will play an important role , similar to what we found out in sec .",
    "[ sec : quad ] .    taking a look first at the two shells at contact ( @xmath152 ) ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr_contours ] the contours of the minimum interaction energy as a function of @xmath92 and the ratio @xmath142 for the distributions already depicted in fig .  [ fig : distributions ] .",
    "several things are notable : a sufficiently large charge variation with respect to @xmath87 will cause a shift from repulsion to the attraction in the configuration of the two shells with the minimum energy .",
    "this critical ratio where the energy changes sign depends on @xmath92 , and becomes increasingly large when @xmath92 approaches 0 . on the other hand , for large @xmath92",
    "the critical ratio seems to approach a constant , which is expectedly bigger than the critical ratio in eq .   where the sign of the charge is still equal everywhere on the shells . additionally ,",
    "as already observed in previous cases , the sign of @xmath127 has an effect only on distributions with even wave numbers , and the value of @xmath87 simply sets the energy scale .",
    "however , the contours where the interaction energy changes sign remain the same regardless of the value of @xmath87 .        the major influence on the critical ratio where the minimum of the interaction energy changes sign appears again to be the number of extrema in the distribution , where lower number of extrema needs lesser variation strength to achieve attraction  meaning lower @xmath30 and lower symmetries . in distributions with the same symmetry and similar @xmath30",
    "the minima of those with odd wave numbers are slightly stronger compared to distributions with even @xmath30 .",
    "this can be understood by taking a look at the cross - term @xmath168 , where one can observe from eq .   that a factor of @xmath169 appears in the summation over the expansion coefficients .",
    "thus , in the minimum configurations of distributions with odd @xmath30 the cross - term is several orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath170 and @xmath151 contributions , whereas the cross - term is comparable if the @xmath30 is even ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ico_radial ] ) .        from this section",
    "we can conclude that even like - charged particles can be found in configurations where they attract each other , if only the local variation of charge is large enough .",
    "it is the presence of patches of opposite sign that mediates this attraction , as can be seen from the regions excluded by dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr_contours ] .",
    "the attraction sets in for close separations of the two particles , as the long - range behavior is dominated by the repulsion of the homogeneous contribution , however small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ico_radial ] ) .",
    "any configuration other than the one with minimum energy can show either a purely repulsive or a mixed short - range attractive / long - range repulsive behavior , as already observed in sec .  [ sec : quad ] .",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the interaction of two permeable , arbitrarily charged spherical particles in the dh approximation . to study the interactions of virus - like particles or other shells with symmetric variations in surface charge distributions",
    "we have introduced model charge distributions with icosahedral , octahedral , and tetrahedral symmetry , and characterized by a single wave number .",
    "we find that local variations in the charge distributions leading to local charge separation into oppositely charged patches reduce the repulsion between like - charged shells , a feature that has also been observed in models of protein - protein interactions  @xcite as well as in dna - dna interactions  @xcite",
    ". an important consequence of the reduced repulsion is that it can be furthermore turned into explicit attraction if the background homogeneous charge is small enough .",
    "this onset of attraction between like - charged particles is due to the presence of local variation of charge , since the attracting patches have to have opposite sign .",
    "the attraction is short - ranged with respect to the separation between the particles , with the long - ranged interaction engendered by the homogeneous charge background still being ( vanishingly ) repulsive .",
    "apart from the minimum interaction free energy configuration , any other configuration can exhibit either a purely repulsive or a mixed short - range attractive / long - range repulsive behavior .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the approach used here is the linearization of the non - linear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation .",
    "the approximation is well - justified for radii relevant for viruses  @xcite ( @xmath171 nm ) and salt concentrations of @xmath172 mm . however , for smaller salt concentrations where @xmath173 the dh theory overestimates the values of the potential and consequently the energy  @xcite , meaning that the values obtained for the interaction energy at shell contact are too big . the qualitative behavior , on the other hand",
    ", is expected to be much the same  @xcite .",
    "the non - homogeneous charge distributions introduced in this paper were all mapped on a single - shell capsid model .",
    "a further improvement would be a two - shell model , with each shell carrying a distribution corresponding to the charge on the inner and outer shells  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the single - shell model is able to capture the main aspects of the electrostatic interactions in the system  @xcite .",
    "if the charge distributions can be characterized by one or only a few different wave numbers ( like the ones considered in this paper ) , this greatly simplifies the expressions for the interaction potential , limiting many of the sums involved . on the other hand , distributions where patches extend over well - defined surface regions",
    "can be difficult to be parametrized within the formalism .",
    "the most extreme cases would be distributions of point charges on a shell or a partially formed capsid as considered in ref .",
    " i.e. distributions consisting of delta functions or heaviside step functions in the solid angle , which are also notoriously difficult to accurately represent with a finite number of terms in an expansion .",
    "the symmetric charge distributions presented can serve as improved models in a broad variety of virus systems .",
    "one such example could be the adsorption of flexible polyelectrolytes on viral capsids which have dodecahedral charge distribution , where a combination of the lowest dodecahedral symmetry ( @xmath161 in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] ) with the addition of a homogeneous background nicely fits the model of discrete charges as used in ref .  .",
    "these models also open up the possibilities of studying the interaction of viral capsids with multivalent ions within the dressed counterions theory , or even multivalent ion mediated interaction between two such capsids  @xcite .",
    "the derived expressions for the interaction potential are certainly too heavy to be used in computer simulations . and even though molecular dynamics simulations show that switching from continuous to discrete charge patterns in model spherical proteins leads to significant differences between the resulting screened coulomb interactions  @xcite , the continuous distributions presented are more tractable analytically , especially since the symmetries can be described by using one or at most few different wave numbers .",
