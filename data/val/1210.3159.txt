    "in standard cosmology it is assumed that the space - time is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "after the discovery of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and accelerating expansion of the universe , a standard cosmological model describing universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) is formulated , known as @xmath0cdm model or cosmic concordance model .",
    "fluctuations in the temperature of cmb radiation are statistically isotropic in this model @xcite .",
    "a central assumption in our standard model of cosmology ( and in most cosmological models ) is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic upto small perturbations , and thus described by a perturbed freidmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "obersevations show that the temperature of the cmb is isotropic to a remarkable degree indicating that our universe is close to an friedmann - lemaitre ( fl ) model .",
    "according to ehlers , geren and sachs ( egs ) theorem @xcite , if the cmb temperature were exactly isotropic about every point in spacetime , then the universe would have to be exactly an fl model .",
    "this result is not directly applicable to cmb , because , cmb radiation is not exactly isotropic .",
    "the presence of temperature anisotropies in the cmb from the observations made by cobe / wmap satellites are inconsistent with an exact homogeneous and isotropic frw model @xcite .",
    "the current cmb data supports an inflationary big bang model of cosmic origin for our universe .",
    "however at large angular scales , there are some anomalies observed in cmb data , such as , a low value for quadrupole power , alignment of quadrupole and octopole modes roughly in the direction of virgo cluster , ecliptic north - south power asymmetry , parity asymmetry between even and odd multipoles , almost zero correlations on large angular scales of cmb and an anomalous cold spot ( @xmath1 diameter ) in the southern galactic hemisphere of cmb sky @xcite . several solutions to the low multipole cmb anomalies",
    "have been put forth such as foregrounds / systematics , anisotropic space - times and exotic topologies @xcite .",
    "some of these supposed deviations seen in cmb data were addressed by the wmap and planck science teams also @xcite .",
    "these deviations may be an evidence that we live in a globally anisotropic universe .    generally , in a global anisotropic universe , during inflation , shear decreases and eventually it goes over to an isotropic phase with negligible shear @xcite . in order to produce any substantial amount of shear in recent times",
    "one needs to induce anisotropy in the spacetime .",
    "one way to induce anisotropy is to have anisotropic matter present at the last scattering surface .",
    "it was shown earlier that the power suppression in cmb quadrupole , without affecting higher multipoles , can be explained by assuming anisotropic matter ( magnetic fields ) @xcite .",
    "earlier works on anisotropic cosmological models with anisotropic stresses can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "anisotropic dark energy as a possible solution to the cosmic acceleration as well as the large scale cmb anomalies is studied , for example , in ref .",
    "the anisotropic sources can be a uniform magnetic field , cosmic strings or domain walls",
    ". a nanogauss scale magnetic field could be present today which would have been produced during inflation due to a lorentz - violating term to the photon sector @xcite .",
    "we call this as `` lorentz violation generated magnetic field ( lvmf ) '' . other possibilities such as a maxwell type vector field coupled to a scalar field",
    "is studied , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "our approach is not to deal with metric approach directly , but rather to adhere to an approach similar to orthonormal frame formalism @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : bianchii ] , we write down the einstein s equations in cosmic time .",
    "geodesic equations in cosmic time are studied in section [ sec : geodesic ] . in section [ sec :",
    "fixedpoint ] , we do a fixed point analysis of all the evolution equations in terms of a dimensionless time variable ( @xmath2 ) , to study the asymptotic evolution of the state observables .",
    "then , in section [ sec : cmbpattern ] , we show the temperature patterns for cmb due to various anisotropic sources considered in our study .",
    "a more realistic model including the ordinary dark matter and dark energy components in addition to the anisotropic sources already considered , is studied in section [ sec : realscenario ] . in section [ sec : snconstr ] , we obtain the constrains on the fractional energy densites due to various components in the realistic model of the previous section , the level of shear , and also determine a preferred axis if present .",
    "finally , we conclude our work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the way we study dynamical systems is that we first write evolution equations in terms of few dimensionless state observables .",
    "it is a very invaluable tool to obtain qualitative information about the solutions of the state space of bianchi universes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we concentrate only on bianchi  i model .",
    "first we derive the einstein equations in metric approach .",
    "then we write in terms of the state observables analogous to the orthonormal frame formalism @xcite . in this approach",
    "one writes the field equations as first order differential equations .",
    "an advantage of this orthonormal frame approach is that the derivation of geodesic equation is easy compared to the metric approach .",
    "we start with a bianchi  i line element with a residual planar symmetry in the @xmath3 plane as @xmath4 we choose the diagonal energy momentum tensor of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the four kinds of anisotropic matter we study here are given in table  [ tabl : matter ] .",
    "the magnetic field configuration considered here as anisotropic source is well known @xcite .",
    "we , then consider a particular configuration of infinite domain walls ( spanning the @xmath3 plane ) stacked along the @xmath8axis . in this case , average energy momentum tensor will take the form we just described .",
    "similarly , the average energy momentum tensor due to a distribution of long , thin , straight cosmic strings along @xmath8axis which takes an anisotropic form , also serves as anisotropic matter source @xcite .",
    "finally , a magnetic field generated due to a lorentz - violating term in the photon sector , which we call lvmf in short , is also studied as an anisotropic source @xcite .",
    ".matter content for different anisotropic sources considered in this paper . [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "here we studied the evolution of bianchi - i universe in the presence of different types of anisotropic matter sources .",
    "first we analyzed the evolution of the state space variables @xmath9 in cosmic time .",
    "depending on the initial conditions we found that there can be a sign change in the shear .",
    "this may have some interesting implications in early universe cosmology .",
    "then we examined the evolution of dimensionless variables viz .",
    ", @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in dimensionless time @xmath2 . in the @xmath13frame",
    ", we determined the fixed points of the full set of evolution equations including the geodesic equations .",
    "we also checked the stability of the fixed points numerically . in terms of @xmath2 variable , we get an analytic expression for the temperature anisotropies of the cmbr .",
    "then we generated the temperature patterns of the cmb for the four different types of anisotropic matter considered here .",
    "we found that the contribution to the cmb temperature signal is mainly through the quadrupole .",
    "we also pointed out the difference between the cmb tempearture maps due to all cases of anoisotropic matter considered in this work .",
    "we then investigated a more realistic scenario where we included ordinary isotropic dark matter and cosmological constant as dark energy .",
    "we found that the universe asymptotically evolves to a desitter universe .",
    "we also constrained the parameters of this model using supernovae union  2 data .",
    "we also found a preferred axis from the data for all the four cases of anisotropic matter .",
    "this anisotropy axis is found to be same independent of the anisotropic source we used .",
    "it turns out that this axis is very close to the mirror symmetry axis found in cmb data @xcite",
    ".    it will be interesting to generalise our results to other bianchi classes - a and b. in case of other bianchi models the state space would be larger and we need to find different subspace of the state space and their stable fixed points .",
    "it will also be interesting to study the cmb polarisation anisotropy in these models .",
