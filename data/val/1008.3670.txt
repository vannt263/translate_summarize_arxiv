    "interaction of the test masses in a terrestrial gravity experiment with these fields could result in a sidereal modulation of the force between the masses , thus providing a test of lorentz invariance in gravity .",
    "a quantitative description of lorentz violation consistent with local field theory is given by the standard - model extension ( sme ) , which has recently been expanded to include gravitational effects.@xcite the expression for the potential between two test masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the ` pure gravity ' sector of the sme is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the vector separating @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath6 is the projection of the unit vector along @xmath5 in the @xmath7th direction , and @xmath8 is a set of 9 dimensionless coefficients for lorentz violation in the standard laboratory frame.@xcite motivated by ref .",

    "the planar geometry concentrates as much mass as possible at the scale of interest , and is nominally null with respect to @xmath0 forces .",
    "this is effective in suppressing the newtonian background relative to new short - range effects , but has detrimental consequences for testing the pure gravity sector of the sme .",
    "the force  sensitive ` detector ' mass is driven by the force  generating ` source ' mass at a resonance near 1  khz , placing a heavy burden on vibration isolation .",
