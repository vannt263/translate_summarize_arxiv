    "the value @xmath133 is consistent with the two - dimensional classical ising model .",
    "the value @xmath135 means that the dynamics of the monte carlo simulation are governed by pure diffusion .",
    "it suggests a random singlet phase .    on the dimer side ( @xmath137 ) , interpretation is not straightforward .",
    "it is not good to deplete the strong antiferromagnetic bonds which are the majority .",
    "depletion of the strong ferromagnetic bonds ( the haldane cluster ) is possible , and weak effective bonds of the amplitude @xmath138 $ ] @xcite may replace them . we can obtain the same critical behavior by this procedure .",
    "however , the estimated values of the exponent @xmath139 do not coincide with the numerical results .      putting all the results together",

    "a string order parameter seems to remain finite .",
    "raw relaxation functions of the local susceptibility suggest that the excitation gap is zero . however",
    ", scaling analysis suggests that the gap is finite .",
    "except for the scaling result these lines of evidence suggest this region is the quantum griffiths ( qg ) phase : no excitation gap and a finite string order . however , classical magnetic orders exhibit critical behavior in this region .",

    "@xmath146 , an exponent of the local susceptibility is weakly dependent on @xmath25 , suggesting a universal phase . at the fully random point @xmath66 , however , relaxation of the uniform staggered magnetization is qualitatively the same as the uniform @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "the classical magnetic order is critical in this phase .",

    "behaviors of the relaxation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : figaf - fit](a ) suggest the following scenario for the appearance of magnetic order .",
    "short - range antiferromagnetic correlations are first destroyed by local singlet dimer states or local haldane states that appear during the initial relaxation of exponential decay ( @xmath147 ) . beyond these local states , there exist very weak but finite effective interactions .",
    "this is because local singlet states or local haldane states are not the exact eigenstate of the total hamiltonian .",
    "the effective interactions obey the power - law distribution as in eq .",

    "they are considered to produce local excitation gaps .",
    "then , the magnetic order decays exponentially by this excitation gap .",

    "this is considered to be the origin of the criticality of the uniform antiferromagnetic order .",
    "magnetic order is observed in the experiment with the help of the interchain interactions .",
    "the present phenomenon is quite interesting because the uniform antiferromagnetic order survives despite the randomly located ferromagnetic bonds .",
    "this may be a new exotic quantum phenomenon .",
    "the role of the ferromagnetic bonds in the quantum system should be reconsidered .",
    "it is also noted that the present mechanism explains the general impurity - induced long - range order phenomenon .",
    "@xcite randomly doped impurities divide a spin chain into local gapful clusters linked together with small but finite interactions .",
    "the edge spins of the cluster correlate with each other by effective bonds which exhibit the power - law distribution .",
    "collections of the correlation become the algebraic decay as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
