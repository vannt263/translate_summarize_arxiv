    "precision position measurement of an atom has been of interest since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "an illustrative example is the heisenberg microscope which allows measurement of the position of an atom by observing scattering of light from it .",
    "modern tools of quantum optics have made such thought experiments a reality .",
    "a variation of the heisenberg s microscope has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it allows suboptical wavelength position measurements of moving atoms as they pass through the optical fields .",
    "since then a variety of methods have been studied for subwavelength localization of an atom passing through standing - wave fields .",
    "subwavelength atom localization has been shown to be possible through quantum interference  @xcite , by measuring a quadrature phase of the light field in a cavity as the atom passes through it  @xcite , through detection of spontaneously emitted photons  @xcite , by diffracting the atoms through a measurement induced grating  @xcite or by raman - induced resonance imaging  @xcite .",
    "recently phase control of subwavelength atom localization has also been shown giving rise to variety of interesting controllable features in atom localization  @xcite .",
    "similar techniques could also be used to perform measurement of the atomic center of mass wavefunction as proposed recently by one of us and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the study of atom localization affords practical applications in the area of nanolithography at the heisenberg limit  @xcite along with its fundamental importance to the areas of atom optics  @xcite , and laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms  @xcite . in this article",
    "we propose a high resolution localization scheme based on the phenomena of coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite .",
    "a standing - wave control field and a weak probe field cause the atom to evolve into a long - lived superposition of the two ground states .",
    "measuring the position dependent coherence of this trapping state localizes the atom . extending the scheme to two dimensions ,",
    "optical lattices with tighter than usual confinement at each lattice point can be obtained .",
    "such a strongly confined lattice structures could be useful to study several predictions of the bloch theory of solids and mott transitions in much cleaner systems .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "first we discuss the scheme of localization through the phenomena of coherent population trapping . as the localization of the atom occurs through the detection of coherence we provide a couple of detection schemes that would lead to localization of the atom in a subwavelength regime as it passes through the standing wave field . to ascertain the localization we present the momentum distribution of the localized atom and point out unique features that , if seen experimentally , would confirm the localization of the atom in the subwavelength domain .",
    "next , we point out several applications of the scheme and the unique advantages it offers",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "the level scheme for our model is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : levelscheme ] ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) along with a possible experimental geometry .",
    "the atom has @xmath0 type level configuration , such that it is coupled to two fields in two - photon resonance raman configuration as shown in the figure .",
    "a possible atomic specie could be @xmath1rb with the levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 drawn from the two hyperfine components of the ground state .",
    "the strong control field is the standing - wave field that could be a field confined in an optical cavity or a fabry - perot resonator or produced using two counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "the rabi frequencies of the standing - wave field ( @xmath4 , with the wavenumber @xmath5 ) and the weak probe field ( @xmath6 ) could be of the order of tens of mhz and the laser power level could be few mw/@xmath7 as in a typical cpt experiment  @xcite .",
    "the laser fields are along the @xmath8 plane as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : levelscheme ] , such that the atom sees them at the same time at is travels along @xmath9 direction .",
    "application of a strong standing - wave field , on @xmath10 transition , and a weak probe field , on @xmath11 transition , prepares the atom in a particular position - dependent superposition of the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 in steady state . probing this superposition through selective measurement of the population of state @xmath2 , causes subwavelength localization of the atom at the nodes of the standing - wave field . ]",
    "the initial state of the atoms is @xmath3 as they enter the fields in the transverse @xmath9 direction with the center - of - mass distribution uniformly spread over a few standing - wave field wavelenghts .",
    "we assume that the velocity of the atoms in the @xmath9 direction can be treated classically and there is no significant variation of the @xmath12-velocity of the atoms as they interact with the fields ; therefore the kinetic part of the atoms can be ignored within the raman - nath approximation ( rna )  @xcite .",
    "this poses limitation on the extent of the localization possible as stricter confinement along @xmath12-direction causes increasing spread in the @xmath12-momentum of the atom .",
    "however , rna requires the recoil kinetic energy , @xmath13 , acquired by the atom of mass @xmath14 due to its @xmath12-momentum , @xmath15 , should be significantly less than the interaction energy with the fields , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 throughout the interaction region .",
    "the interaction of the fields with the three - level atom , within the two - photon resonance condition , can be described through the interaction hamiltonian @xmath19 a quick observation shows that the state @xmath20 where @xmath21 , does not evolve dynamically as @xmath22 .",
    "thus , an atom initially prepared in state @xmath3 will end up in state @xmath23 at steady state , if the two - photon resonance is maintained .",
    "as the population in the state @xmath23 can not escape , it is termed as the trapping state and the phenomena is called coherent population trapping .",
    "this state , being a superposition of ground states , does not decohere .",
    "there could be a physical loss of atoms during the transit time ; however , this is not a limitation as these atoms would not be localized . with the detuning @xmath24 sufficiently large ,",
    "the atom is hardly excited and recoil due spontaneous emission becomes a non - issue  @xcite .",
    "thus , ensuring the two - photon resonance , introduces coherence @xmath25 between the levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 that carries the spatial dependence of the standing - wave field . also , as the cpt state @xmath23 is reached , the population of the state @xmath2 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , so long as the steady state is reached within the interaction time ( typically 100 ns ) governed by the @xmath9-velocity of the moving atoms , monitoring the population of state @xmath2 is a sufficient measure of the coherence of the cpt state .",
    "this interaction time is well below the limit of @xmath28s required to remain within the rna for @xmath1rb atoms undergoing optical transitions  @xcite .",
    "our numerical study , considering both gaussian and flat - top beams , shows that the spatial intensity profile is inconsequential if the trapping - state is reached in steady - state within the interaction time .",
    "it is important to point out that the atom passing through the standing - wave field and the probe field will see spatial variation of the laser intensity .",
    "this can , equivalently , be seen as the time variation of the interaction rabi frequencies as experienced by the atom . to study the dependence of the laser intensity variation at the beam boundaries as seen by the atom we studied two types of line - shapes , namely gaussian and flat - top : @xmath29}\\quad \\text{gaussian}\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\omega(t ) & = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}{\\left[}\\tanh{\\left(}\\frac{t - t_1}{r_1}{\\right)}-\\tanh{\\left(}\\frac{t - t_2}{r_2}{\\right)}{\\right]}\\quad \\text{flat - top}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the center and the width of the gaussian respectively and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond to the start of the rise of the beam intensity , rise time , start of the intensity fall , and the fall time respectively for the flat - top beam",
    ". for both the gaussian and the flat - top beams the maximum intensity is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "our numerical studies , choosing either kind of beam shape for both the standing - wave and the probe fields with the maximum intensity ratio chosen to be @xmath37 show that as long as the beam parameters introduced above are chosen such that the atom reaches the steady state while well before the beam intensity starts to fall , the cpt state is reached in the steady state .",
    "once the steady state is reached , as there are no strong decoherence mechanisms , beam intensity fall does not change the steady state .",
    "physically , the above mechanism can be thought of as state preparation . during state preparation , time",
    "varying light - fields could be applied to reach a desired state of the atoms .",
    "once the desired state is reached the light fields are turned off . nevertheless , turning off the fields after the state is created does not change the state until it decoheres through some other mechanisms . in the above , if the beam parameters are appropriately chosen so that the steady state can be reached while the atom is in the beams , then cpt state is reached and turning off of the beams does not change the state .",
    "we plot the population @xmath38 versus @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots ] for various values of the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "emergence of subwavelength localization as the ratio @xmath37 is increased .",
    "plot of @xmath40 vs @xmath39 for various values of @xmath37 .",
    "the range of @xmath39 , @xmath41 , covers one wavelength of the standing - wave field .",
    "@xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath38 is uniform at all spatial points @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 increasing the cavity field strength localization peaks emerge with decreasing peak width . ]",
    "the population shows peaks at the nodes of the standing - wave field .",
    "the fwhm of the peaks is given by @xmath46 .",
    "thus , for small values of the ratio of the rabi frequencies the peaks are not well defined .",
    "in fact , for @xmath43 , @xmath38 has no spatial dependence .",
    "the small @xmath37 behavior is shown in the part @xmath42 of the figure where the emergence of the localization peaks is clearly seen . for large @xmath37 ,",
    "the peaks become quite sharp , leading to subwavelength localization .",
    "it can be noted that eq .",
    "has the same structure as the transmission function of the fabry - perot cavity  @xcite , with the ratio @xmath37 of the effective field intensities playing the role of the cavity finesse .",
    "interestingly , in the present model the finesse can be controlled by varying the relative intensities of the control and probe fields , leading to much sharper features in @xmath38 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plots ] ) .",
    "it is imperative to point out the meaning of the result obtained above .",
    "the state vector of the atom , including its center - of - mass degree of freedom and the cpt internal state , can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the center - of - mass wavefunction .",
    "thus , observance of a peak in @xmath38 amounts to a collapse of the internal state of the atom to @xmath2 at one of the positions corresponding to the nodes of the standing - wave field .",
    "this leads to the collapse of the center - of - mass wavefunction at one of those positions leading to localization of the atom . with sharper features in @xmath40",
    "one obtains deeper localization of the atom within a subwavelength region of the optical field .",
    "our treatment assumes that @xmath48 is uniform over the standing - wave field , which remains unchanged even after the interaction with the optical fields .",
    "it is the measurement process that leads to the localization of the atoms .",
    "it is important that the atoms are detected in a state selective manner after their interaction with the laser fields .",
    "if , however , the total population of the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 is measured , there would be no position information in the result obtained .",
    "this illustrates the role of quantum coherence and interference in the cpt state .",
    "in the following we discuss methods for detection of the cpt state . as alluded earlier simplest possible and sufficient technique is to measure @xmath38 . alternatively , measuring the coherence @xmath49 , which is proportional to @xmath50 , can also be used to detect the cpt state .",
    "thus , any measurement technique monitoring the coherence @xmath49 , would observe sharp decrease in the coherence if the atom passes through the nodes of the standing - wave field , leading to localization of the atom . at all other positions the coherence @xmath49 carries a non - zero value .",
    "however , ascertaining a zero of a function experimentally could be challenging as opposed to observing peaks .",
    "therefore , we discuss an alternative technique to measure the coherence without having to ascertain a zero value .    monitoring the population , @xmath38 , of state @xmath2",
    "can be accomplished by various techniques , we describe two interesting ones .",
    "the first method is based on the fluoresence shelving techniques described in ref .",
    "it involves applying a strong drive field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : monitor]@xmath42 ) to selectively couple the to - be - measured state to a short lived excited state .",
    "then monitoring the fluoresence from the excited states gives information about the population of the state to be measured .",
    "techniques to monitor the atom localization .",
    "the cpt state of the atom could be probed by monitoring the population of the state @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath42 fluoresence shelving technique for efficient measurement of @xmath40 .",
    "applying a strong shelving field and monitoring the resulting fluoresence leads to localization of the atom at the nodes of the standing - wave field . @xmath45",
    "heterodyne measurement of the fluoresence from the atom also leads to localization as soon as the heterodyne beat signal is detected . ]    alternatively , another high - resolution technique , based on the heterodyne measurement of fluoresence from a single atom developed by the walther group  @xcite , can be devised .",
    "the scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : monitor]@xmath45 .",
    "a weak probe acts on the transition involving state @xmath2 and any other excited state of the atom besides @xmath51 . heterodyning the resulting fluorescence with the incoming laser",
    "gives information about the population of the state @xmath2 .",
    "monitoring the coherence , @xmath49 , can be accomplished by illuminating the atom , as it comes out in a cpt state , by a @xmath52 radio - frequancy ( rf ) field directly coupling the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such a pulse gives a transformation @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , monitoring the population of state @xmath2 , which can be shown to be @xmath55 , using the techniques depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : monitor ] gives the measure of coherence prepared by the control and the probe fields .",
    "@xmath56 has sharp features at the nodes of the standing - wave field for larger values of @xmath37 and has a value @xmath57 ; measuring it leads to atom localization .",
    "fluorescence based measurement techniques are useful in optical domain as the recoil caused by the emission of a photon is negligible .",
    "in a real experiment , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the momentum distribution of atoms would be measured .",
    "to predict the experimental results expected from our model we plot the momentum distribution , along the @xmath12 axis , obtained by evaluating @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : md - plots ] .",
    "here we have assumed that @xmath59 , i.e. uniform distribution of the atoms along the standing - wave field .",
    "moreover , the integration is confined to a single wavelength of the standing wave .",
    "these assumptions do not cause loss of generality and the conclusions arrived at are the plots show the momentum distribution of the atoms after they are detected in state @xmath2 after interacting with the probe and a single wavelength of the standing - wave field . for sharper localization ,",
    "resulting due to increased @xmath37 , the higher momentum components start emerging in accordance with the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "the number of peaks for the plot corresponding to no localization are large in number compared to other plots , despite the amplitude being negligible for high @xmath60 .",
    "as the localization peaks start appearing , alternate peaks in the momentum distribution start diminishing ( see for example plots for @xmath43 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , observing this feature in the momentum distribution is a clear signature of the localization of the atom .",
    "as the finesse parameter is increased higher momentum components start becoming prominent .",
    "therefore , to remain within the raman - nath approximation , the highest momentum order @xmath62 observed for @xmath63 should satisfy @xmath64 . for optical transitions of alkali atoms , @xmath65 is in the khz range whereas @xmath6 is in the mhz range ( table i in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , giving @xmath66 to be well - within the raman - nath approximation .",
    "momentum distribution @xmath67 in the far - zone , for atoms in state @xmath2 , for different values of parameter @xmath37 . ]",
    "as seen above , stricter localization of the atoms gives rise to larger momentum spread .",
    "thus , it is sometimes advisable to have smaller finesse parameter but to repeat the localization procedure a number of times .",
    "we observe that sharper localization is also possible by increasing the localization zones , instead of increasing the value of the finesse parameter . to illustrate , we choose a moderate value , @xmath61 , for the finesse parameter and show the localization peaks for single , two and four localization zones arranged one after the other in fig .",
    "[ fig : repeats ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that as the number of zones are increased , sharper position localization is obtained .",
    "this could be a more practical way of achieving sharper localization than increasing the strength of the standing - wave field relative to the probe .     sharper localization by repetition of the localization zones with a moderate finesse parameter @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath45 and @xmath68 correspond to one , two and four localization zones arranged one after the other . ]",
    "we suggest some applications and advantages of our scheme : it can be noted that ac - stark shift induced potential on a two - level atom due to two detuned , and counter - propagating light beams gives rise to optical lattice for trapping neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "the cold neutral atoms in their ground states are trapped at the nodes of the standing - wave fields arising due to the counter - propagating beams .",
    "this optical - lattice trapping potential , which is proportional to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the wavenumber , is much broader than the localization feature attainable through eq .  .",
    "thus , by applying our localization scheme in two - dimensions  @xcite , deeper and much narrower lattice structures can be obtained .",
    "such experiments could be easily done with degenerate bose or fermi gases to study several predictions of the bloch theory of solids and observation of mott transitions  @xcite .",
    "it should however has to be borne in mind that state selective detection of atoms from the ensemble of atoms in a bec would be required .",
    "whenever , this kind of detection becomes available experimentally our scheme can be readily employed to obtain new kind of optical lattices and atomic mott insulators .",
    "noting the spread of the momentum distribution with stricter localization of the atom , any practical implementation of this scheme would require working in the spatial domain such that the atoms are not significantly diffracted . for example , for lithographic applications , the state selective detection and deposition of the atoms on the substrate would have to be done very close to the interaction region .",
    "this may make it necessary to use fibers to collect the fluorescence signal .",
    "this , nevertheless , does not pose any serious limitation as other state selective deposition techniques could be employed instead .",
    "the standing - wave field can be thought of as a mask for the atoms as opposed to a physical entity used in current lithographic setups .",
    "one can also envision two - dimensional  @xcite spatial dependence of the light field giving rise to arbitrary two - dimensional localization pattern of atoms for lithographic applications .    furthermore , the feature size given by our localization scheme ( eq .  )",
    "can always be chosen to be much smaller that the width of the center - of - mass position distribution of the entering atoms , even if the latter is considerably smaller than the wavelength of the standing light field .",
    "this provides a strong advantage for atom localization because , through monitoring of atomic coherences , we can control atomic distributions which are much smaller than the wavelength of the light fields and produce strong localization .",
    "to summarize , we have devised a scheme for extreme localization of an atom as it is passing through a standing - wave field , based on the phenomena of coherent population trapping .",
    "the resolution of localization peaks can be arbitrarily increased by changing the relative intensity of the probe and standing - wave control fields .",
    "the atomic coherence obtained this way resembles the transfer function of fabry - perot cavity with controllable finesse . increasing the finesse leads to increasing resolution for atom localization .",
    "we have discussed several methods to probe the resulting cpt state of the internal atomic states , either through selective monitoring of the population of one of the states or through the coherence measurement .",
    "we have also discussed the signature of the localization observable in the momentum distribution of the atoms in the far zone .",
    "it is also clarified how the resulting momentum distribution also helps validate the raman - nath approximation .",
    "we have suggested various techniques for implementation of the model for fundamental as well as practical applications .",
