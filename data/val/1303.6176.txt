    "over the course of the last 15 years , there has been a renewed interest in the casimir effect .",
    "this was partly due to a second generation of experiments , started in 1997 , which triggered a sustained flow of both theoretical and experimental works .",
    "as an outcome of those works , our knowledge about the dependence of casimir forces on the geometry and material properties of the objects involved has remarkably improved  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical counterpart of the casimir effect , also known as ` motion induced radiation ' , has also been the subject of intense research , manifested in the consequent profusion of works  @xcite .",
    "although the direct measurement of radiation generated by moving mirrors is a daunting experimental challenge , photon creation induced by time dependent external boundary conditions has , indeed , been observed experimentally , albeit in a different context , namely , superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "there are also ongoing experiments aimed at measuring the photon creation induced by the time dependent conductivity of a semiconductor slab enclosed by an electromagnetic cavity  @xcite , and proposals based on the use of high frequency resonators to produce the photons , and ultracold atoms to detect the created photons via superradiance @xcite .",
    "the superconducting circuit experiment mentioned above  @xcite , consists of a coplanar waveguide terminated by a squid , upon which a time dependent magnetic flux is applied .",
    "this system can be described by a quantum scalar field @xmath1 ( the magnetic flux at the different positions of the transmission line ) satisfying on the squid ( located at @xmath2 ) the boundary condition  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants , and @xmath6 is proportional to the ( time - dependent ) external magnetic flux . equation ( [ eq : gbc ] ) can be interpreted as a sort of generalized robin boundary condition , because of the presence of the term with second - order time derivatives .",
    "the theoretical analysis of that experiment was done assuming that the term proportional to the second derivative of the field is negligible @xcite . whence the boundary condition became a standard robin boundary condition with",
    "a time dependent , externally driven parameter .",
    "the boundary condition that results after implementing this approximation , has been described in terms of an effective length  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the particle creation rate for the case of a quantum field satisfying ( time independent ) robin boundary conditions on a _ moving _ mirror has been investigated in ref .",
    "the complementary situation , namely , time dependent robin boundary conditions on a _",
    "static _ mirror have been considered in refs .",
    "it is the aim of this work to consider the static and dynamical casimir effects for quantum fields which are subject to generalized boundary conditions of the type defined in eq.([eq : gbc ] ) .",
    "our interest in this problem is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", the presence of the second derivative of the field in the boundary condition modifies the usual sturm - liouville problem , what manifests itself in the existence of an eigenvalue - dependent boundary condition .",
    "this problem , well - known to mathematicians , has also been considered in different areas of physics .",
    "it has not , however , to our knowledge , been dealt with in the casimir effect context .",
    "regarding the experimental relevance of the inclusion of this kind of term , we note that , although it may be neglected in the particular experimental setup considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , this contribution to the boundary condition may indeed affect the spectral distribution of the created particles  @xcite , something to which future experiments might be sensitive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : classical ] , we describe the classical aspects of the model , including a mechanical analogue , a discussion of the eigenvalue problem and the necessity of modifying the inner product between eigenfunctions due to the presence of the second order derivative in the boundary condition . in section  [ sec : static ] we compute the static vacuum energy , section  [ sec : dynamical ] deals with the dynamical casimir effect , and section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "many different boundary conditions a scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions can be subject to , can be realized in classical mechanics analogues , based on vibrating strings . indeed , dirichlet boundary conditions correspond to a string with fixed endpoints , while neumann conditions can be implemented by attaching , to the corresponding endpoint , a massless ring which can slide freely and frictionless along a vertical rod .",
    "robin boundary conditions result , in turn , when the ring is also coupled to a vertical spring  @xcite . finally , the generalized boundary condition of eq.([eq : gbc ] ) can be generated by letting the ring be massive rather than massless ( in all cases we will consider the linear regime , i.e. small amplitude oscillations of the string ) .    to see this ,",
    "let us assume @xmath7 to be the string tension , @xmath8 its mass density , and that its configuration may be described by a single function @xmath9 , measuring its vertical departure from the equilibrium configuration . denoting by @xmath10 the mass of the ring and by @xmath11 the spring constant , the position of the ring",
    ", @xmath12 satisfies newton s equation : @xmath13 which has the same form as the generalized boundary condition of eq.([eq : gbc ] ) .",
    "the vibrating string problem with this kind of condition on one of its endpoints constitutes a well known problem in classical vibrations .",
    "we stress that the boundary condition for the deformation of the string is in fact the dynamical equation for the position of the ring @xmath14 , and this is the origin of the presence of second order time derivatives in the generalized boundary condition .",
    "a proper treatment of the system should regard @xmath15 and @xmath9 as qualitatively different degrees of freedom , in the sense that @xmath16 has a discrete , finite mass , while @xmath17 is endowed with a continuous mass density .",
    "an enlightening way to treat this kind of problem can be seen , for example , in  @xcite , where the quantization of a non relativistic string with an arbitrary mass distribution has been considered .",
    "there , a system with a single continuous mass distribution which approximates the mixed continuous and discrete case has been considered . in this way , all the steps of the lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms , and even canonical quantization , are well defined .",
    "the desired mass distribution is approached at the end of the process , as a special limit , after all the stumbling blocks in the procedure are avoided .",
    "we will follow here an alternative procedure , which , as we have explicitly checked , yields the same results .",
    "since the difficulties in the problem at hand come from the fact that the discrete mass is precisely at one of the endpoints of the system , we avoid the coincidence of those two singularities by temporarily splitting them .",
    "indeed , we shall first assume that the mass @xmath10 is located at an arbitrary position @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and impose neumann boundary conditions at and .",
    "the generalized robin boundary condition at @xmath2 is then recovered by taking the ` coincidence limit ' @xmath20 .",
    "the classical lagrangian then reads : @xmath21\\ ; ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with neumann conditions implicitly assumed at and .    from the classical equation of motion",
    "one can easily check that the presence of a localized mass on the string induces a discontinuity in the spatial derivative of @xmath17 , @xmath22    note that the string can interchange energy with the mass , and the conserved total energy of this system reads @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\   & &   + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa y^2(x_0,t ) + \\frac{1}{2 } m\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t}\\right)_{x = x_0}^2\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , the sum of the mechanical energies associated to the string and the ring .",
    "let us now focus on the analogous case of a scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions , as a toy model for the electromagnetic field in @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "we assume the lagrangian to be given by the expression : @xmath25\\ , ,   \\label{model2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 as in the mechanical model , we shall regard this as a simple model to describe a cavity in which the permittivity and conductivity are concentrated at the point @xmath28 , which , tending to @xmath29 from the left , reproduces the generalized robin condition at @xmath2 .",
    "the particular case @xmath30 and @xmath31 has been considered in ref.@xcite , as a simple model of the experimental setup of ref.@xcite ( the generalization to the electromagnetic case has been analyzed in ref.@xcite ) . in section [ sec : static ] we will compute the casimir interaction energy between two slabs described by constant values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in section iv we will compute the photon creation associated to a time dependent @xmath34 and @xmath33 .      let us consider the model given in eq.([model2 ] ) , with neumann boundary conditions at @xmath35 .",
    "we will compute the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the particular case @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "however , defining a generalized inner product ( see the appendix and refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath44 one can check the orthogonality @xmath45 for @xmath46 . with appropriate normalization",
    ", the eigenfunctions can be chosen to be orthonormal , as we shall assume it has been done in what follows .",
    "this phenomenon is a general feature of the hybrid continuous plus discrete systems , where one can show that the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are orthogonal for a scalar product defined in terms of a kernel  @xcite , which defines a sturm - liouville problem .",
    "the equations above are valid even in the time - dependent case @xmath47 , in which the eigenvalues become parametrically dependent on time , as well as the eigenfunctions @xmath48 .",
    "we will analyze the time - dependent situation in section iv .",
    "writing the field @xmath49 as a linear combination of the spatial eigenfunctions @xmath50 and inserting this expression into the classical lagrangian one can check that it reduces to a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators @xmath51 , with frequency @xmath52 : @xmath53 details of this calculation are presented in the appendix .",
    "note that the additional term in the inner product eq.([inner ] ) is crucial to cancel the kinetic term concentrated at @xmath18 .",
    "note also that these results can be straightforwardly generalized to cases where several slabs are located at different positions .",
    "once the system has been reduced to a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators , the calculation of the vacuum energy can be performed by direct mode - summation .",
    "we will explicitly compute the static casimir effect for two different physical situations : the interaction between two thin slabs , each one described by its conductivity and permittivity ( in free space ) , and a system that satisfies generalized boundary conditions .",

    "moreover , in the @xmath81 limit , one has @xmath82 , and the result reproduces the usual one for dirichlet boundary conditions . note that , as @xmath83 , the presence of the second order time derivative in the boundary conditions enhances the interaction between slabs .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the final result for the casimir energy is tantamount to the one corresponding to a @xmath80-potential with a frequency - dependent coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , this result could have been derived using lifshitz formula with the particular reflection coefficients that describe the slabs .",
    "the above calculation is an alternative and equivalent way to compute the vacuum energy , that shows that the casimir energy is just the sum over the eigenfrequencies defined by the @xmath85-dependent boundary conditions .",

    "this can be easily checked changing variables @xmath105 in eq.([casimirgrbc ] ) .",

    "when @xmath106 , @xmath98 is negative for all values of @xmath102 , and therefore the force is repulsive .",

    "the frequencies of the classical oscillators become time - dependent , and the lagrangian contains additional terms proportional to derivatives of the basis functions , which in turn are proportional to the derivatives of the eigenvalues @xmath116 .",

    "the explicit expressions for them are derived in the appendix .",
    "note that , if the time dependence of the eigenvalues is proportional to a dimensionless parameter @xmath80 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( see eq.([ays ] ) ) .",
    "let us now assume that the externally driven property @xmath34 has a harmonic time dependence with frequency @xmath122 . when the external frequency is tuned with an eigenfrequency of the static cavity @xmath123 , with @xmath124 one of the solutions to eq.([gbcx0 ] ) , we expect the number of created photons to be enhanced by parametric resonance .",
    "moreover , since in general the spectrum of the cavity is not regularly - spaced , it is reasonable to neglect couplings between modes  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is essentially given by that of the mode associated to @xmath125 , i.e. a single harmonic oscillator with time dependent frequency : @xmath126\\label{msa}\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have neglected terms of order @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 is a solution to @xmath129    for the sake of simplicity , we will solve this equation for @xmath20 .",
    "we denote by @xmath124 a solution to eq.([gbcx0det ] ) in the static case @xmath130 . assuming that @xmath131 , with @xmath132",

    "it is interesting to analyze two opposite limiting cases . when @xmath137 , the lowest frequency solution is @xmath138 , and therefore @xmath139 .",
    "the particle creation rate , in this case , is @xmath140 .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath141 , the first solution to the transcendental eq .",
    "( [ gbcmodel ] ) is @xmath142 in this case we have @xmath143 ( assuming that @xmath144 ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding rate is @xmath145 .",
    "the last case may be of some interest for the experimental observation of the dynamical casimir effect , since the robin or generalized robin boundary conditions may be adjusted in such a way to reduce the value of the lowest eigenfrequency of the unperturbed cavity .",
    "this point deserves further analysis .    when considering the parametric resonance situation , it is crucial to tune the external frequency with one of the eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath101 in the boundary condition , however small , does introduce significant modifications to the static eigenfrequencies of the cavity . this effect may be relevant , for instance , for an experiment with a coplanar waveguide of finite size .",
    "as an illustration of the last point , let us assume that @xmath20 and that the external frequency is twice the lowest eigenfrequency of the cavity ( that is , twice the first solution to eq.([gbcmodel ] ) ) . in a realistic situation  @xcite , @xmath146 , and an approximate solution is @xmath147 . expanding the transcendental equation around this solution",
    "we obtain @xmath148 assuming @xcite @xmath149 and @xmath150 the correction to the lowest eigenfrequency due to @xmath101 is @xmath151 .",
    "this small correction should be taken into account in order to achieve parametric resonance if the amplitude of the time - dependent external conditions is sufficiently small  @xcite .",
    "the original aim of this work has been to analyze the static and dynamical casimir effects when the field satisfies generalized boundary conditions involving second order time derivatives .",
    "these conditions were in turn motivated by the effective boundary condition satisfied by the magnetic flux in a waveguide terminated by a squid , a setup that has been recently employed as a device to measure the creation of photons from the vacuum in the presence of time - dependent external fields  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this problem does have a simple and well - known classical analogue : a loaded string . from this point of view , the presence of the second - order time derivative is not surprising , since the boundary condition is in this case nothing but the dynamical equation for a massive ring attached to the end of the string . from a mathematical point of view , we have eigenvalue - dependent boundary conditions , and therefore the eigenfunctions associated to different eigenvalues are not orthogonal under the usual inner product .",
    "a generalization of the inner product makes them orthogonal .",
    "when expanding the deformation of the string in terms of spatial eigenfunctions , the additional term in the inner product exactly cancels out the kinetic term associated to the ring , and one ends up with a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "this mechanical analogy lead us to consider a more general situation , in which the ring is not attached to the end of the string ; rather , it is located at an arbitrary distance from the endpoint . from a field - theory perspective , this can be considered as a toy model for an electromagnetic cavity in which one inserts a thin slab characterized by its conductivity and permittivity . from the quantum circuits point of view , this corresponds to a situation in which a squid is inserted in a one - dimensional waveguide .",
    "therefore , we computed the static casimir interaction energy between two slabs , generalizing previous results for @xmath80-potentials .",
    "we also computed the static vacuum energy for the particular case in which the slab is near a border of the cavity . in summary , we have shown that the casimir energy can be computed as the sum over modes satisfying the generalized robin boundary condition .    finally , and coming back to the original motivation , we considered some particular aspects of the dynamical casimir effect for the generalized boundary conditions . on the one hand , we computed the particle creation rate assuming parametric resonance for the case of a finite waveguide ended by a squid . on the other hand , we discussed the influence of the second order time derivative on the tuning of the external pumping with one of the eigenfrequencies of the cavity .",
    "we have seen that the term proportional to @xmath152 in the boundary condition may indeed be relevant for this tuning .",
    "the analysis of loaded strings with masses distributed periodically along it , or analogue acoustic and elastic systems , induces the presence of ( approximate ) band gaps in the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze theoretically electromagnetic analogues of these configurations , like a waveguide with several squids , distributed periodically on it , or a microwave cavity with several slabs inserted accordingly .",
    "[ [ a ] ]    in this appendix we present some details of the calculations of the classical lagrangian in both the static and dynamical cases .    to begin with ,",
    "let us show that it is necessary to modify the usual inner product in order to have an orthonormal basis .",
    "the eigenfunctions satisfy @xmath153 with the boundary conditions @xmath154 for the sake of definiteness , we choose neumann boundary conditions at @xmath35 .",

    "<S> we present a study of the static and dynamical casimir effects for a quantum field theory satisfying generalized robin boundary condition , of a kind that arises naturally within the context of quantum circuits . </S>",
    "<S> since those conditions may also be relevant to measurements of the dynamical casimir effect , we evaluate their role in the concrete example of a real scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions , a system which has a well - known mechanical analogue involving a loaded string . </S>"
