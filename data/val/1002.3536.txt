    "the adsorption of colloidal ( nano)particles at liquid - liquid interfaces is not only of scientific interest , but also relevant for industry .",
    "the formation of two - dimensional structures  @xcite , which may be utilized in photonic bandgap materials , and the stabilization of pickering emulsions  @xcite , are two examples of possible applications .",
    "there is also an impetus to theoretically describe the colloidal adsorption process more accurately , in order to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms at work in experimental systems . especially two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluid phenomena , and phase transitions in 2d fluids of anisotropic particles  @xcite are of interest .",
    "the tunability and variety of colloidal particles currently available , coupled with our still limited knowledge on colloidal adsorption , leaves the study of their interfacial phenomena an open field .    to better understand the complex systems  @xcite which arise when colloidal particles are brought in contact with an interface",
    ", we developed a method to determine the free energy associated to the adsorption of a single particle  @xcite .",
    "this free - energy calculation is based on similar surface tension arguments as proposed by pieranski  @xcite , in his ground breaking study of colloidal adsorption phenomena .",
    "the model in our investigations encompasses surface and line tension , but disregards interfacial deformation and electrostatic effects . our contribution to this theoretical description",
    "is the triangular tessellation scheme  @xcite , which allows us to efficiently determine the adsorption free energy of an anisotropic colloid . in this paper",
    "we apply our technique to perform an initial investigation into the dynamics that occur when a colloid attaches at the interface and relaxes to its preferred configuration .",
    "the dynamics we study in our model is a simplified version of langevin dynamics  @xcite . from the adsorption free energy , which acts as a potential energy on the colloid , a vector field of the adsorption force",
    "is determined .",
    "this vector field is then studied by flow lines . for convenience ,",
    "the anisotropy of the particle is only considered in the free energy and not in the friction tensor , which for interfacial systems would also be position dependent .",
    "our choice allows us to examine general trends and gross features , and to showcase our numerical method , whilst at the same time give results which resemble those one would expect for actual physical systems .",
    "we consider the time scale associated with the behavior predicted by our model , and conclude that there are parameters for which the dynamics are sufficiently slow to allow these effects to be observed in experimental systems .    in this paper",
    "we focus on three systems to point out the complexities that anisotropy can induce in the adsorption process . as a reference system",
    "we discuss the adsorption of an ellipsoidal particle for several conveniently chosen system parameters .",
    "subsequently , we proceed to describe the same system for a cylindrical particle to show the effects of shape .",
    "the free - energy landscape for cylinders is more complicated , leading to metastable adsorption configurations with a large stability domain in the adsorption region . finally , we study a cylindrical colloid with aspect ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the occurrence of interfacial adsorption here is strongly dependent on the way in which the particle makes initial contact with the interface .",
    "for some initial configurations there will be no adsorption at the interface , depending on the value of the three - phase contact angle of the particle and the two liquids .    in conclusion , we apply our triangular tessellation scheme to determine the adsorption behavior of non - convex particles via flow - line dynamics .",

    "in the previous we have seen that the dynamics of colloid motion through the interface can be very rich . in this section",
    "we analyze the relation between the proposed flow - line dynamics and the dynamics associated to experimental systems .",
    "we also discuss the elements present in real systems , which we have not incorporated in our simple model and consider how they might affect the obtained results .      for a dispersed particle undergoing a force ,",
    "the dynamics are governed by a solution to the complete langevin equation  @xcite . when we neglect inertia , the random force term , and limit ourselves to studying the @xmath1 and @xmath7 components , the equations of motion ( eoms ) become @xmath200 where @xmath92 is the `` real '' unreduced time , @xmath201 is our unscaled adsorption free energy , and @xmath28 is the long semiaxis of the particle .",
    "the prefactors @xmath202 and @xmath203 represent the translational and rotational friction coefficients respectively . these coefficients should account for the size @xmath28 and the shape of the particle , as well as , the positional @xmath1 and orientational @xmath7 dependencies of the system .",
    "this includes the difference in viscosity between the two media , which influences the friction force , the way in which friction changes in the @xmath1 direction according to the colloid s @xmath7 , and vice versa .",

    "instead we find @xmath215 , which differs by a factor of @xmath216 .",
    "in retrospect , it would have been more appropriate to rescale the system such that the flow - line dynamics give the expected results for a sphere . however , we investigated the adsorption trajectories with this constraint and found qualitatively similar results .    before discussing the accuracy of the simplifications used in our research , let us gauge the time @xmath92 required for a colloid to attach to the interface and relax to its final position .",

    "[ fig : ell_motion ] , [ fig : cyl_motion ] , and [ fig : cyl_mot ] the duration of the adsorption process ( the part in which significant changes occur ) is of the order @xmath217 . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : unittime ] , the physical time is estimated at @xmath218 upon using this approximation we arrive at the following result , see table  [ tab : time ] . here",
    "we have considered an ellipse with aspect ratios @xmath144 and @xmath105 , sizes @xmath219 nm , @xmath220 nm , and @xmath221 @xmath203 m , which are typical colloidal length scales . for the viscosity we use @xmath222 pas ( glycerol ) , @xmath223 pas ( cyclohexylchloride ) , and @xmath224 pas ( h@xmath225o )  @xcite , which are commonly used solvents .",
    "surface tension values between two typical liquids are of the order @xmath226",
    "nm@xmath227  @xcite or lower than @xmath228 nm@xmath227 with the addition of surfactants  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that it follows from table  [ tab : time ]",
    "that length of the adsorption process can vary significantly with the choice of system parameters . for values of the interfacial tension which are in the order @xmath229 nm@xmath227 the adsorption process typically takes tens to hundreds of microseconds .",
    "however , upon lowering the interfacial tension , e.g. , by adding surfactants , the process slows down significantly , in some cases taking upwards of a second .",
    "this is an exciting prospect , since for many systems the time scale is thus accessible to experimental techniques .",
    "it can also be shown that the particular shape of the particle , e.g , ellipsoid , cylinder , or spherocylinder , does not influence these results significantly , since @xmath230 is virtually the same for these particle types .    the limiting factor in an experiment to determine the adsorption behavior is the maximum operating frequency of the camera and not the optical elements used for imaging . for modern cameras operating frequencies of @xmath231 hz or more are obtainable  @xcite . however , we should bare in mind that our time @xmath92 is based on a rather crude estimate and that there can be a substantial deviation from the prediction from this value for an actual experimental system .",
    "nevertheless , a discrepancy of a decade or two will still place many of the above mentioned systems within the experimentally observable range .",
    "there are several key points of criticism which can be identified when trying to compare the dynamics predicted by our flow lines in the reduced system to real - world dynamics .",
    "these points should be taken into account in follow - up studies , but go beyond the scope of an initial investigation .    neglecting the random thermal force component",
    "is an acceptable simplification , if we only want to study the average movement , i.e. , the trajectory averaged over many adsorption events .",
    "some care should be taken though , since it is clear from , for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : cyl_sep](b ) that adsorption trajectories which have almost identical starting points can diverge from each other quite rapidly .",
    "this may prove problematic in establishing an average for an experimental system , especially when the magnitude of the free - energy landscape features becomes in the order of a k@xmath232 t .",
    "neglecting the inertia is also acceptable , since most colloidal systems are strongly overdamped . even under high potential differences",
    "@xmath233 a 1 @xmath203 m colloidal particle can typically experience an interfacial adsorption potential in the order of @xmath234-k@xmath232 t  @xcite @xmath233 colloids can not be easily forced into the ballistic regime of motion .",
    "another point of concern is neglecting anisotropic effects in friction force . as we have seen in the previous ,",
    "the friction coefficient in part imposes the time scale on the system . for anisotropic particles , which have a friction coefficient tensor , this time scale changes according to the direction of motion and the position of the particle .",
    "however , the difference in friction coefficient between motion along the long semiaxis of an ellipsoid and perpendicular to this semiaxis has been shown to be no greater than a factor of two  @xcite . for the rotational friction , the change is likely to be more substantial than a factor of two for strongly oblong particles .",
    "suppose we assume proportionality with the rotational radius to the third power , as is the case for a sphere  @xcite .",
    "then , depending on the axis of rotation , the friction coefficient varies between @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "even if the proportionality is less extreme than in our simple estimate , the differences can easily be very significant .",
    "the difference in friction between the two media bordering the interface , can be several orders of magnitude , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for the viscosity values of commonly used solvents .",
    "such a difference in friction coefficient will play a role in describing a particular system accurately .",
    "we assumed that the timescale of the dynamics are dominated by the medium with the highest friction coefficient , or , equivalently , viscosity .",
    "this assumption holds whenever there is substantial penetration of the colloid in that medium .",
    "a more accurate approach requires us to weight the friction coefficient by the surface areas of the particle which are in the respective media .",
    "strong differences in viscosity of the respective media most likely induce a resistance for the colloid to move into the more viscous medium .",
    "this can substantially alter the qualitative behavior of the flow lines .    for experimental systems",
    "the solvent is sometimes density - matched to the particle to eliminate the effects of gravity .",
    "matching is however more complicated to achieve for a three component system , such as the particle near a liquid - liquid interface . to account for gravity in our model , whenever ,",
    "we require the buoyancy mass of the particle . this mass can be determined by volume integration over the parts which penetrate the respective media , assuming a homogeneous density distribution .",
    "such volumetric integrations can be performed , using a 3d analogy of our 2d surface integration scheme based on triangular tessellation .",
    "that is to say , some kind of spatial tessellation using polyhedra .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for colloidal systems the effects of gravity will be negligible , because of the low bond number for such particle sizes .    in many physical system ,",
    "the particle and the interface are often charged by self dissociation of the surface molecules on the colloid and of those which compose the media  @xcite . for a like - charged interface",
    "there can be a substantial charge repulsion barrier which needs to be overcome before adsorption can take place , if this barrier can be crossed at all . including electrostatic effects into the model",
    "will substantially change the appearance of the free - energy landscape .",
    "finally , we should stress that including interfacial deformation  @xcite into our model should qualitatively change the results , whenever the capillary effects are dominant .",
    "together with electrostatic effects , the results of deformation can not be predicted at this time .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have identified the time which we expect the adsorption process to take for several experimentally feasible systems , based on our model .",
    "the results are encouraging as this time regime seems to be accessible to current experimental techniques , even though there are still quite a few caveats to be considered .",
    "we have employed the triangular tessellation technique introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the adsorption free - energy landscape of anisotropic colloids at a flat interface .",
    "this free energy is composed of surface and line tension contributions , but does not take into account interfacial deformation and electrostatics .",
    "we analyzed the obtained free - energy landscapes by means of a vector field of adsorption force and its associated flow lines .",
    "these flow lines are calculated using a linear steepest descent method and they are parametrized in units of reduced time .",
    "the link between these flow line dynamics and langevin dynamics and the validity of our approximation are examined . for typical viscosities and surface tensions",
    "we predict that timescales to complete the adsorption process are in the microsecond to second regime .",
    "such timescales are accessible for observation in modern experimental set - ups .    within our model",
    ", we re - establish that there is a strong dependence of the adsorption free - energy landscape on the shape of the colloidal particle .",
    "this in turn leads to a wide range of adsorption phenomena . for ellipsoidal particles we find a single equilibrium adsorption configuration with relatively simple dynamics .",
    "however , for cylindrical particles there can be two adsorption configurations , depending on the value of the contact angle .",
    "the presence of two minima in the free - energy landscape leads to a separatrix , which forms the divide between the regions to which the respective minima are attractive .",
    "the metastable minimum can have a large domain in the adsorption region to which it is attractive .",
    "this is significant , since it suggests that adsorption in unexpected configurations should be easier than previously believed .",
    "the implications of this large domain size on the experimentally observed buckling and flipping transitions  @xcite merits further investigation .",
    "we have also shown that for short cylinders the free - energy landscape allows for another type of colloid interaction with the interface , other than adsorption .",
    "depending on the value of the contact angle , there can be a domain in the adsorption region , for which colloids do not attach to the interface , but simply move through it unhindered .",
    "this is of particular interest , since it shows , within the confines of our model , that the presence of stable and metastable adsorption configurations is not a sufficient criterion to guarantee particle adsorption . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that this phenomenon has been observed theoretically .",
    "our simple model to calculate the free energy does not include interfacial deformation due to capillary , electrostatic , or gravitational forces ; nor does it take into account inertia , anisotropy in the friction tensor , and the brownian random force to determine the colloid dynamics .",
    "we are however optimistic that the phenomenology described here can be recovered in a more elaborate model .",
    "the method presented here thus forms the first stepping stone towards obtaining better correspondence between experiments and their theoretical description , and thus brings us to a closer understanding of colloidal adsorption phenomena .",
