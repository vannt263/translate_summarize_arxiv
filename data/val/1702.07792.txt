    "the many types of spectroscopy that have been developed over the years ( some of which are still under development ) serve as an indispensable tool to gain fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of molecular systems.@xcite equally indispensable are the large number of theoretical methods that nowadays allow for accurate _ in silico _ simulations of said systems and spectroscopies , and which can provide complementary information that is inaccessible in the experiment . when designing calculations of molecular properties , it is often necessary to consider the influence of the surrounding environment to obtain adequate accuracy . given the typical steep computational scaling of quantum - chemical methods with respect to the number of basis functions , the description of large molecular systems is out of question using conventional algorithms .",
    "one way to partially address the challenges of treating large systems is to exploit localization techniques and simplified treatments of long - range interactions to achieve reduced , ultimately linear scaling.@xcite while linear scaling formulations , aided by increasing computer power , significantly extend the applicability range of quantum chemistry , they are generally too costly for routine applications , especially if the system and property of interest put special demands on method , basis set and conformational sampling . for instance , even in cases where ( time - dependent ) density functional theory ( ( td)dft ) is still feasible , it may suffer from electron - transfer overstabilization in the ground state @xcite and artificial low - lying charge - transfer transitions@xcite due to the self - interaction errors associated with approximate standard exchange ",
    "correlation functionals .",
    "another complication is that the delocalized picture obtained from such brute - force calculations is not straightforward to interpret in terms of chemical concepts and generally requires additional decomposition analyses of the wave function and properties into local components .",
    "an alternative route is to adopt subsystem approaches in which the system is divided into chemically well - defined constituents which may be treated as separate entities perturbed by the other subsystems , and as such they offer a natural decomposition into environmental effects .",
    "several methods belong to this category and one may generally distinguish two conceptually different approaches : ( _ i _ ) strict subsystem methods that treat the subsystems consistently on an equal footing and which upon recombination yield the properties of the entire system,@xcite and ( _ ii _ ) the so - called embedding approaches in which an accurate quantum - mechanical description is intended for only a smaller part of the system , while the remaining parts ( the environment ) and its effects on the former are described with more efficient , approximate methods . a recent review of subsystem and embedding approaches can be found in ref .  .",
    "apart from the obvious computational cost argument , embedding approaches are motivated by the fact that the chemical identity of subsystems is largely intact in molecular complexes and that many electronic transitions are localized in nature .",
    "prototypical examples are solute  solvent systems and chromophore",
    " protein complexes .",
    "frozen - density embedding@xcite ( fde ) provides in principle a full quantum - mechanical description of the system based on a subsystem formulation of dft and can be applied in both a self - consistent and an embedding mode thereby bridging ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) . in principle , it is a formally exact framework although its quality with respect to supermolecular dft in practical calculations is limited by approximations in the employed nonadditive parts of the exchange  correlation and kinetic energy functionals .    more efficient , though more approximate embedding approaches are quantum  classical models , such as hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics methods , which use a discrete but classical representation of the environment.@xcite these approaches are classified in a hierarchy according to the extent of the coupling between the quantum and classical subsystems . in electrostatic embedding ,",
    "the environment is represented as a purely external electrostatic potential perturbing the density of the quantum subsystem , while a more realistic description incorporating the mutual polarization effects between the quantum and classical subsystems is offered by polarizable embedding schemes .",
    "a variety of embedding schemes to model environment polarization have been proposed and applied , such as induced dipoles and fluctuating charges.@xcite inclusion of the explicit environmental response is particularly important for processes where substantial rearrangements may occur , e.g. , upon electronic excitation.@xcite in the fde scheme , state - specific polarization of the environment can be included in the self - consistent mode of the formalism by interchanging the roles of the subsystems in so - called freeze - and - thaw iterations.@xcite in polarizable embedding , this is replaced by a self - consistent determination of the model - specific embedding parameters describing the polarization of the environment .",
    "both fde@xcite and polarizable embedding approaches@xcite have been generalized to a response formalism to allow for the calculation of response and transition properties of molecules embedded in large molecular complexes .",
    "the computational cost associated with the explicit coupling of the subsystem excitation manifolds in a fully coupled fde scheme generally hinders the inclusion of the dynamical response of the entire environment in large complexes,@xcite but allows in a truncated form to describe a few strongly coupled local excitations as relevant for chromophoric aggregates.@xcite the classical treatment in polarizable embedding schemes , on the other hand , offers an efficient inclusion of the dynamic environmental response , provided the perturbing field is nonresonant with respect to local excitations in the environment.@xcite this restriction has , however , been lifted by introducing phenomenological excited - state lifetimes in the response formalism , see refs .  .",
    "the objective of the present work is to formulate a rigorous derivation of linear response theory within polarizable embedding starting from a quantum - mechanical treatment of the entire system .",
    "while various polarizable embedding schemes differ in the specific representation of the environment , the underlying mathematical structure and physical content of their working equations are the same.@xcite for the present aim , we will focus on the explicit expressions for the polarizable embedding ( pe ) model@xcite in which the environment is described in terms of a distributed multipole representation , thus providing a well - defined link to the environment charge density .",
    "we note that the main conclusions will also be valid for , e.g. , polarizable density embedding,@xcite which goes beyond pure polarizable embedding .",
    "while the formally exact fde framework has previously been used as a common theoretical platform for discussing embedding models,@xcite our derivation will be based on an explicit parameterization of the wave function of the combined system .",
    "the origin and inherent limitations of polarizable embedding become particularly transparent in this framework since approximations are introduced by imposing restrictions directly on the corresponding wave function parameterization , as we shall see .",
    "the implications of the choice of parameterization are pertinent to the extension to response properties : the equivalence between response theory and state - specific approaches is lost when employing a nonlinear parameterization,@xcite as is the case for polarizable embedding , such that different physical pictures emerge in the two formalisms . on the basis of a four - state model , it was shown in ref .   that the exact second - order excitation energy for a system of two interacting subsystems contains three contributions in addition to the zeroth - order term describing the excitation within a frozen environment : ( _ i _ ) a term describing the differential polarization in the environment upon excitation in the embedded molecule , i.e. , a classical induction effect , ( _ ii _ ) the difference in dispersion interaction between the environment and the embedded molecule in its ground state and excited state as given by the casimir  polder formula , and ( _ iii _ ) a term that describes the coupling between the excited state of interest with all lower - lying states of the embedded molecule , i.e. , de - excitations , in terms of a screened interaction mediated by the environment through its dynamic polarizability ( evaluated at the excitation frequency ) .",
    "for a generalization beyond a few - state model , see refs .  .",
    "regardless the debated interpretation of this term as a dispersion effect,@xcite a nonresonant excitonic coupling between subsystems@xcite or a resonant coupling,@xcite it is a manifestation of the mutual correlation of the electrons in the subsystems . employing a direct - product _",
    "ansatz _ in a linear response framework recovers only the third term , although it should be noted that the correspondence is incomplete for all but the lowest excitation since de - excitations to lower - lying states different from the ground state are missing in the response treatment based on a ground - state reference.@xcite on the other hand , only the state - specific induction term ( _ i _ ) is recovered in a state - specific formalism .    whereas previous theoretical analyses have primarily focused on excitation energies,@xcite we shall here be concerned with the general linear response function , and not only its poles .",
    "based on the linear response function of the combined system , we will derive two different subsystem decompositions , referred to as symmetric and nonsymmetric , respectively .",
    "these provide a direct link to the standard response formulations of polarizable embedding based on the classical description of the energy contribution of the interaction with the environment.@xcite in addition to justifying the form of the environmental effects in polarizable embedding schemes , the present analysis also sheds light on the basic features of coupled systems and potential complications in separating out subsystem contributions to molecular properties .",
    "as discussed by pavanello in the subsystem dft framework , transitions in composite systems are not strictly localized in the sense that the pole structure of the combined system is inherited by the individual subsystem contributions to the linear response function.@xcite we will extend that analysis by considering the consequences on the evaluation of transition strengths in an embedding framework by contrasting the symmetric and nonsymmetric decompositions .",
    "this exposition will further benefit from our consideration of the complex linear response function of the combined system that puts emphasis on conservation laws for integrated intensities and their ramifications for the decomposed forms of the response function used in practical polarizable embedding schemes .",
    "finally , the key features of linear response theory of a combined system subjected to a weak external electric field will be illustrated numerically by considering a six - level - model of a hydrogen - bonded dimer complex formed by water and _ para_-nitroaniline .",
    "this simple example serves to demonstrate the results otherwise found in the theoretical analysis .",
    "our presentation is intended to be self - contained and thus we provide a rather extensive theory section , starting in the first part with a brief review of the conventional quantum - mechanical direct - product _ ansatz _ for the wave function of the combined system.@xcite we then provide a rigorous formulation of linear response theory for a composite system within this theoretical framework .",
    "our formulation allows , upon additional approximations , to recover the pe model . in practice , we exploit two different decompositions that allow for solving the response equations in effective subsystem spaces .",
    "this leads to the definition of effective quantities that provide insight into how subsystem properties are modified in the presence of another interacting subsystem .",
    "the features of the individual terms in the two decompositions are compared with a view to the evaluation of subsystem contributions to response and transition properties . finally , to overcome some of the challenges related to the subsystem formulation in conventional linear response theory , we extend the treatment to a complex response framework .",
    "in addition , such formulation allows to demonstrate the intensity borrowing occurring in a coupled system .    in the second part of the this section",
    ", we analyze the problem of recovering the pe model and its extension to quantum - mechanical linear response theory based on the decompositions derived in the first part .",
    "specifically , we assume a perturbation treatment of the environment subsystem as well as a multipole representation of its charge distribution . in this way",
    ", we provide a rigorous derivation of the environmental effects emerging in linear response theory within polarizable embedding.@xcite    atomic units ( a.u . ) will be used throughout and , in order to keep equations more compact , we will allow ourselves to leave out physical constants that have a numerical value of 1 a.u .",
    "consider a composite system consisting of @xmath0 interacting subsystems each with an integer number of electrons and with a fixed relative position .",
    "a fundamental assumption made in quantum  classical embedding models is that of nonoverlapping subsystem charge densities ( zero - overlap approximation ) , which implies that exchange ",
    "repulsion vanishes . as a consequence ,",
    "the exact wave function of the combined system can be written in the basis of direct - product states constructed from the complete antisymmetrized subsystem spaces.@xcite the nonrelativistic born  oppenheimer hamiltonian for the interacting system decomposes naturally as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electronic hamiltonian of the isolated subsystem _ a _ and @xmath3 the interaction operator describing the interactions between the nuclei and electrons in subsystem _ a _ with those in _",
    "b_. in second quantization , the interaction operator takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the charge and the position vector , respectively , of nucleus @xmath7 of the @xmath8 nuclei in subsystem _ a _ , while @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the corresponding quantities belonging to subsystem _",

    "notice that no exchange integrals between the subsystems survive within the zero - overlap approximation , and the two - electron excitation operator therefore factorizes into subsystem contributions .",

    "the two terms collected in the square bracket represent the classical electrostatic potential generated by the ground states of the remaining subsystems in their polarized states , i.e. , in the presence of the other subsystems . in practice , any wave function _",
    "ansatz _ may be invoked for the individual subsystems and the associated optimization conditions derived upon applying the variational principle .",
    "equation   is analogous to hartree self - consistent field theory , where the orbitals replace the subsystem wave functions .",
    "in particular , the parameterization in eq .   discards direct - product states in which the subsystems are simultaneously excited , which implies that no dispersion effects are included in this approximation .",
    "however , some intersubsystem electron correlation effects are introduced when the direct - product _ ansatz _ is used in a response framework , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we will now consider the electronic response of the composite system to an external optical field within the framework introduced in the previous section .",
    "in such a case , nuclear motions are neglected and only the pure electronic response will be considered .",
    "special attention will be paid to the physical aspects of the intersubsystem interactions in the presence of the applied field , and how they influence molecular properties . for the sake of notational simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict this analysis to two subsystems ( leading to an embedded subsystem _ a _ and an environment _ b _ in polarizable embedding ) and work within a configuration interaction ( ci ) framework for the individual subsystems .",
    "the framework can easily be extended to consider the individual subsystems of the environment still assuming nonoverlapping subsystems , by decomposing the environment wave function into a product of subsystem contributions ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : wavefunction ] ) . this will be used in sec .",
    "[ sec : pe ] .",
    "we also note that , even if we are considering explicitly the ci parameterization for wave functions of the individual subsystems , the principles apply more generally also to other variational wave function models .    the field",
    " matter interaction will be described within the semi - classical framework , where the incident field is treated as a classical plane wave that perturbs the molecular system .",
    "the perturbation operator describing the action of a monochromatic external field on the composite system can then be expressed in terms of fourier components as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are fourier amplitudes associated with the one - electron perturbation operators @xmath23 , using greek subscripts as ( possibly composite ) cartesian labels . in order to maintain hermiticity of @xmath24 , we have @xmath25^*$ ] and @xmath26^{\\dagger}$ ] .",

    "we briefly comment on the employed parameterization : ( _ i _ ) the direct - product parameterization in eq .   is nonlinear : that is , it produces states outside the excitation manifold , defined by the linear action of the operator @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , the exponential parameterization contains states in which both subsystems are excited simultaneously due to products of subsystem excitations , despite the absence of such transitions in the state - transfer operators .",
    "this is analogous to the nonlinear exponential parameterization of a hartree  fock or kohn  sham determinant that is based on a generator of single - electron excitations but yet encompasses multi - electron excited determinants . as mentioned in the introduction , a direct consequence of the use of a nonlinear parameterization is that the properties derived from a response framework will differ from those based on the state - specific formulation .",
