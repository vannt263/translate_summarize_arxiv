    "now that a sm - like higgs particle has been experimentally discovered @xcite , the possibility of an enlarged scalar sector becomes very plausible . in this analysis",
    "we are going to use the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as a probe for new physics and study new contributions to this observable within the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) framework .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been extensively analysed within the standard model ( sm ) and its numerous extensions .",
    "even if the sm prediction still suffers from large theoretical uncertainties ( mostly hadronic and electroweak ) it is a nice place to look for new physics .",
    "the latest result for the discrepancy between the sm prediction and the experimental measured value is given by @xcite @xmath0 here we will study the two - loop barr - zee type @xcite contributions to @xmath1 that have not been analysed previously within the 2hdm . we show that some of these diagrams can bring rather sizeable contributions for a quite large region of the parameter space and therefore can reduce the value of the difference between theory and experiment given by ( [ deltaamuexp ] ) . we also show that other sets of these type of diagrams bring small contributions and can be safely discarded . for the calculations we use the most generic higgs potential and the generic yukawa structure of the aligned two - higgs - doublet model ( a2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "thus , we also re - examine the classical barr - zee type diagrams @xcite expressing their contributions in terms of the three independent complex alignment parameters @xmath2 .",
    "all the results are given in analytical form .",
    "the phenomenological analysis is made assuming a cp - conserving lagrangian .",
    "however , all the generic formulae given in this work can be used for future , and more complete , analyses without assuming cp - conservation .",
    "additional constraints coming from the flavour sector and global fits to the lhc data are also taken into account @xcite .    in the first part of this paper , section  [ sec : a2hdm ] , we present the relevant features of the a2hdm . in section  [ sec : oneloop ] we present the one - loop results in terms of the generic a2hdm parameters . in section  [ sec : twoloop ] we present the classical two - loop barr - zee results and the calculation of the new sets of this type of diagrams that can potentially bring sizeable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment . section  [ sec : phenomeno ]",
    "is dedicated to the phenomenological analysis for the cp - conserving case and the presentation of the relevant contributions .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a brief summary of our results .",
    "one appendix is also given , with technical details for the calculation of a particular set of barr - zee type diagrams .",
    "the 2hdm extends the sm with a second scalar doublet of hypercharge @xmath3 .",
    "it is convenient to work in the so - called higgs basis @xmath4 , where only one doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value : @xmath5 \\ ; , \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\phi_2 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } h^+ \\\\",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ , ( s_2+is_3 )    \\end{array}\\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the goldstone fields .",
    "thus , @xmath8 plays the role of the sm scalar doublet with @xmath9 .",
    "the physical scalar spectrum contains five degrees of freedom : two charged fields @xmath10 and three neutral scalars @xmath11 , which are related with the @xmath12 fields through an orthogonal transformation @xmath13 .",
    "the form of the @xmath14 matrix is fixed by the scalar potential , which determines the neutral scalar mass matrix and the corresponding mass eigenstates . a detailed discussion is given in @xcite .",
    "in general , the cp - odd component @xmath15 mixes with the cp - even fields @xmath16 and the resulting mass eigenstates do not have a definite cp quantum number .",
    "if the scalar potential is cp symmetric this admixture disappears ; in this particular case , @xmath17 and [ eq : cpc_mixing ] ( h + h ) = ( s_1 + s_2 ) . performing a phase redefinition of the neutral cp - even fields",
    ", we can fix the sign of @xmath18 . in this work",
    "we adopt the conventions  @xmath19  and@xmath20 , so that @xmath18 is positive .    the most generic yukawa lagrangian with the sm fermionic content gives rise to fcncs because the fermionic couplings of the two scalar doublets can not be simultaneously diagonalized in flavour space .",
    "the non - diagonal neutral couplings can be eliminated by requiring the alignment in flavour space of the yukawa matrices  @xcite ; _ i.e. _ , the two yukawa matrices coupling to a given type of right - handed fermions are assumed to be proportional to each other and can , therefore , be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "the three proportionality parameters @xmath21  ( @xmath22 ) are arbitrary complex numbers and introduce new sources of cp violation .    in terms of the fermion mass - eigenstate fields ,",
    "the yukawa interactions of the a2hdm read  @xcite [ lagrangian ] l_y & = & - h^+ \\",
    "m_l p_r l } + & & - _ ^0_i , f y^^0_i_f ^0_i + , where @xmath23 are the right - handed and left - handed chirality projectors , @xmath24 the diagonal fermion mass matrices and the couplings of the neutral scalar fields are given by : @xmath25 the usual models with natural flavour conservation , based on discrete @xmath26 symmetries , are recovered for particular ( real ) values of the couplings @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a single neutral scalar with a pair of gauge bosons takes the form ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 which implies @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the strength of the sm higgs interaction is shared by the three 2hdm neutral bosons . in the cp - conserving limit , the cp - odd field decouples while the strength of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 interactions is governed by the corresponding @xmath32 and @xmath33 factors .",
    "again , for further details about the interaction lagrangian as well as the higgs potential , needed for the calculations in this work , see @xcite .",
    "at the one - loop level , the contribution of the 2hdm extension of the sm to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is given by the two well - known diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ oneloop1 ] .",
    "the explicit expressions for these contributions , in terms of the most generic higgs potential and the a2hdm yukawa structure , are given by @xmath34 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the neutral higgses and @xmath35 for the charged higgs .",
    "these contributions have been previously analysed in @xcite .     in two - higgs - doublet models . _ _ ]    it s a known fact that the two - loop bar - zee type diagrams dominate over the one - loop contributions .",
    "the two loop contributions have a loop suppression factor of @xmath36 but also have an enhancement factor of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 stands for the mass of heavy particles running in one of the loops : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    "this last factor usually dominates over the first one .",
    "furthermore , in the usual @xmath42 models , there is an extra enhancement ( suppression ) factor from @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) for some diagrams . in the aligned model",
    "there is a lot more freedom to independently enhance or suppress any contribution through the alignment parameters @xmath21 .",
    "we shall see next , that for somewhat large values of these parameters , there are new barr - zee contributions that have never been taken into account , and can bring quite sizeable contributions to @xmath45 .",
    "the barr - zee type contributions with an internal photon , _",
    "i.e. _ , fig .",
    "[ barzee1 ] , diagrams ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , have been extensively analysed within the 2hdm and also in minimal super - symmetry ( mssm ) framework @xcite .",
    "diagram ( 3 ) from fig .",
    "[ barzee1 ] is also of the barr - zee type and could , in principle bring important contributions .",
    "given that the coupling to a pair of gauge bosons of the recently discovered scalar particle is close to the sm prediction @xcite , one expects the contributions from the remaining scalars to be somewhat suppressed ( by a factor @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , we shall see that this statement is not correct , and that this contribution is quite sizeable .",
    "similar contributions to the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ barzee1 ] , but with the internal photon replaced by a z boson have been also analysed in the literature @xcite .",
    "these contributions have a relative suppression factor of order @xmath47 .",
    "this factor is in part due to the vectorial couplings of @xmath48 to leptons , which are the only ones that survive for both scalar and pseudo - scalar bosons @xcite , and in part from the z propagator which introduces a new mass scale @xmath49 .",
    "therefore we will ignore these contributions in our present analysis .",
    "in two - higgs - doublet models ._,title=\"fig : \" ] @xmath50   in two - higgs - doublet models ._,title=\"fig : \" ]     in two - higgs - doublet models . _ ]     in two - higgs - doublet models . _ ]    this is , pretty much , the summary of all the mechanisms that are usually considered in the literature .",
    "however , there is no reason a priori to discard other similar barr - zee contributions with a charged higgs @xmath51 substituting the neutral scalars @xmath52 , and a @xmath53 boson substituting the internal photon .",
    "these diagrams are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ barzee2 ] . on one hand ,",
    "one expects a relative suppression factor with respect to the contributions of the diagrams from fig .",
    "[ barzee1 ] due to the propagator of the @xmath53 boson ( note that in this case we do nt have the additional suppression factor due to the gauge boson couplings to leptons , as in the @xmath48 case ) . on the other hand",
    ", one must also expect to be able to re - enhance these contributions with the @xmath21 ( or @xmath43 ) parameters , and therefore , obtain sizeable contributions at least in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "in this analysis we shall calculate the contribution from these new diagrams and demonstrate , that in fact , all of these new sets can bring rather sizeable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a quite large region of the parameter space . for completeness",
    "we shall also present the classical two - loop results in terms of the most generic higgs potential and in terms of the generic yukawa texture of the a2hdm .    before moving on to the next section and presenting the analysis",
    ", there are a couple of related cases that are worth discussing .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ barzeeab ] , where the grey circles stand for the same loop contributions as in fig .",
    "[ barzee2 ] ( excluding the fermionic loops for diagram ( b ) which is just a pure sm contribution ) .",
    "the contribution from the first case ( a ) , will have a relative suppression factor @xmath54 with respect to the contributions of diagrams from fig .",
    "[ barzee2 ] so we can safely discard it . the contribution coming from the second set , fig .",
    "[ barzeeab ] ( b ) , does not have this suppression factor , thus we can expect , at least in principle , a rather sizeable effect .",
    "details of the the full calculation of this last set of diagrams , together with other technical details are given in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "roughly one obtains a contribution of @xmath55 which is rather small and we shall not include it in this analysis .",
    "next we move on to the analysis of the set of diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ barzee2 ] which is the main goal of our paper .",
    "the calculation of the two - loop barr - zee type diagrams can be separated in two parts .",
    "we will first calculate the @xmath56 and @xmath57 one - loop effective vertices and obtain analytical and rather simple expressions . with these expressions ,",
    "the calculation of the second loop becomes quite trivial .",
    "the effective vertices can be written in a generic gauge - invariant transverse form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the momentum of the incoming real photon and @xmath60 is the momentum of the out - going virtual gauge boson ( see fig .",
    "[ gamamunu ] ) , and where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are scalar form factors . in order to obtain this expression",
    "we have considered the most generic lorentz structure for the @xmath63 vertex , and we have imposed the electromagnetic current conservation @xmath64 .",
    "all terms proportional to @xmath59 have also been eliminated as they cancel when contracted with the polarization vector of the photon . as the @xmath53 boson is off - shell , in the actual calculation of the effective vertex there",
    "will also appear some other lorentz structures than the ones shown in ( [ transverse ] ) .",
    "however in some cases , these gauge - dependent contributions vanish when calculating the second loop or they are cancelled by some other non barr - zee terms , as it is nicely shown in @xcite .",
    "if this was not the case , when summing the proper non barr - zee contributions to the gauge dependent barr - zee terms , the result must be gauge independent . as the gauge dependence from the barr - zee terms is cancelled by other sub - dominant topologies , we also expect this contribution to be sub - dominant",
    ". therefore , we shall discard these terms in our analysis .     and @xmath65 .",
    "_ ]    the gauge independent contribution from each set represented by the generic topologies in fig .  [ barzee1 ] and fig .",
    "[ barzee2 ] is transverse by itself , _",
    "i.e. , _ of the form given in ( [ transverse ] ) ; we can therefore decompose the results into eight separate contributions .",
    "for the @xmath56 effective vertex @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; as for the @xmath68 vertex we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 . note that the only contributions to the @xmath71 structure come from the fermionic loops .",
    "furthermore , one can adopt our strategy from @xcite , and further simplify the calculations of @xmath72 by only considering the terms that contribute to the structure @xmath73 .",
    "it is worth mentioning the following technical detail .",
    "when performing the calculations for the first loop , after introducing the feynman parametrization and after integrating over the four - momentum , one obtains a denominator similar to @xmath74^{-1 } \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are the masses of @xmath76 particles running in the loop , _",
    "@xmath77 etc .",
    "it is a very common assumption that the photon is  soft \" so one can ignore the @xmath78 term as a good approximation .",
    "this term , in fact , can be safely ignored without making any assumptions on the `` softness '' of the photon . keeping track of this term",
    ", one can observe that it simply vanishes when calculating the second loop integral .",
    "however , this happens accidentally for diagrams ( 1 ) to ( 6 ) ; for the @xmath79 effective vertices calculated in appendix  [ appendixa ] , this is not always the case .",
    "thus , having checked that these terms play no role in our present case , we will discard them already at the one - loop level in order to give simpler and more elegant expressions for the form factors @xmath80 and @xmath81 . after performing the four - momentum loop integral",
