    "@xmath2d electron systems exhibit a number of peculiarities which destroy the familiar fermi - liquid behavior known from higher dimensions .",
    "main reason is the geometrical restriction of the motion in @xmath2d where electrons can not avoid each other . as a consequence excitations are plasmons similar to sound waves in solids .",
    "the corresponding phase is called a luttinger liquid ( ll ) @xcite . renewed interest in lls arises from progress in manufacturing narrow quantum wires with a few or a single conducting channel .",
    "examples are carbon nanotubes @xcite , polydiacetylen @xcite , quantum hall edges @xcite and semiconductor cleave edge quantum wires @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "1d quantum wires allow the investigation of the interplay of interaction and disorder effects since short range interaction can be treated already within a harmonic bosonic theory @xcite .",
    "central quantity is the interaction parameter @xmath3 which plays the role of a dimensionless conductance of a clean ll @xcite .",
    "the effect of disorder on transport in lls has been so far considered in two limiting cases :    \\(i ) the effect of a _ single impurity _",
    "was considered in @xcite . here",
    "the conductance depends crucially on @xmath3 .",
    "impurities are irrelevant for attractive ( @xmath4 ) and strongly relevant for repulsive interaction ( @xmath5 ) , respectively . for finite voltage @xmath6 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the conductance is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these considerations can be extended to two impurities .",
    "depending on the applied gate voltage , coulomb blockade effects may give rise to resonant tunneling @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) in the opposite case of a _ finite density of _ weak _ impurities _ , ( gaussian ) disorder is a relevant perturbation for @xmath8 leading to the localization of electrons . for weak external electric field",
    "@xmath1 the conductivity is highly nonlinear : @xmath9 @xcite . at low but finite temperatures",
    "@xmath0 this result goes over into the vrh expression for the linear conductivity @xmath10 @xcite . at higher temperatures",

    "@xcite which we will address in the present paper .",
    "in particular we determine both the temperature and electric field dependence of the ( nonlinear ) conductivity for this case in a broad temperature and electric field region .",
    "the main results of the paper are the conductivities ( [ eq : large_e ] ) , ( [ eq : large_t ] ) , ( [ eq : small_e ] ) and ( [ eq : small_t ] ) as well as the crossover behavior summarized in fig .",

    "since @xmath27 below we will assume the @xmath28 to be random phases but keep the impurity distance @xmath29 approximately constant @xmath30 .",
    "next we consider the current resulting from tunneling processes between metastable states , assuming strong pinning and weak quantum fluctuations , i.e. @xmath31 . the tunneling process starts from a classical _ metastable _ configuration @xmath32 which minimizes the impurity potential for all values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",

    "the instanton is then a rectangular object with extension @xmath70 and @xmath71 in @xmath72 and @xmath33 direction , respectively .",
    "the instanton action can then be written as @xmath73 here we introduced the dimensionless field strength @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 denotes the compressibility .",

    "in addition , we have to include a small dissipative term @xmath82 , @xmath83 , in the action in order to allow for energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "however , we will omit @xmath84-dependent terms in all results where they give only small corrections ( apart from possible pre - exponential factors which we do not consider ) .",
    "a necessary condition for tunneling is @xmath85 for @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 . the tunneling probability follows from the saddle point value of the instanton action where @xmath88 fulfils the condition @xmath89",
    "we discuss now several special cases : ( i ) for sufficiently large fields @xmath90 the saddle point is @xmath91 which gives a tunneling probability @xmath92 .",
    "the exponent @xmath93 results from the integration around the saddle point .",
    "because of small @xmath3 and correspondingly large kink core action , tunneling through single impurities ( @xmath94 ) is preferred and hence the nonlinear conductivity is given by @xmath95 in agreement with previous results for tunneling through a single weak link @xcite if we identify @xmath96 with the hopping amplitude @xmath97 through the link .",
    "the upper field strength for the validity of this result can be estimated from @xmath98 since the instantons loose then their meaning .",
