    "we have developed several methods , and try to derive reliable conclusions , independent of any specific ( sky or background ) model . + in the following sections , we review the main characteristics of the instrument and data - set and discuss the basic principles of the developed methods in section  [ sec2 ] .",

    "the instrument s in - flight performance is described in @xcite .",
    "due to its non - conventional coded mask imaging system , the imaging capability relies also on a specific observational strategy based on a dithering procedure @xcite , where the direction of pointing of each exposure is shifted from the previous one by @xmath52.2@xmath6 .",
    "a revolution lasts 3 days , the time that the spacecraft performs a large eccentric orbit , but half of a day of data is unusable because of the radiation belts crossing .",
    "it contains generally about 100 exposures lasting approximately 45 minutes each . +",

    "nonetheless , it is possible to analyze the signal in this energy range thanks to another electronic chain ( via pulse shape discriminators or psds ) not affected by the saturation problem . the procedure is explained in @xcite .",

    ", it results in about 77000 exposures and 2@xmath110@xmath8 s observation livetime .",
    "+ we performed our analyzes of the  line emission in the 1805 - 1813 kev band , to take into account the germanium energy resolution ( fwhm of 2.9 kev at 1764 kev ) , including its degradation between two consecutive annealings ( @xmath9 ) . at these energies ,",
    "the gain calibration ( performed orbit - wise ) accuracy is better than @xmath100.01 kev .",
    "the signal recorded by the  camera on the 19 ge detectors is composed of contributions from each source ( point - like or extended ) present in the field - of - view , convolved by the instrument aperture , plus the background . for extended / diffuse sources ,",
    "we assume that their spatial distributions are given by an analytical function or an emission map ( section  [ sec_templates ] ) whose intensities are to be determined . for a given energy band and for @xmath11 sources located in the field of view",
    ", the data @xmath12 obtained during an exposure ( pointing ) p for the detector d can be expressed by the relation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intensity of source j. @xmath15 is the response of the instrument to source j , @xmath16 the background , and @xmath17 the statistical noise ( both for exposure p and detector d ) .",
    "we assumed that there are @xmath18 exposures and @xmath19 detectors .",
    "+ at the energies considered in this paper ( e @xmath20 1 mev ) , point - source emissions are weak and stable in time within the measurement uncertainties . concerning the extended / diffuse sources , they are not expected to vary .",
    "thus , for a given set of @xmath18 exposures and @xmath19 detectors , the system of equations , as formulated above , requires @xmath21 equations to solve for @xmath22 unknowns .",
    "hence , it is mandatory to reduce the number of unknowns .",
    "we will see below that the observed properties of the background allow us to strongly decrease the corresponding number of free parameters . finally , to determine the sky model parameters , we adjust the data through a multi - component fitting algorithm , based on the maximum likelihood statistics . expected counts are obtained by convolving a sky model with the instrument response and then adding the background model .",
    "the resulting distribution is compared to the recorded data with free normalizations of both components .",
    "we used poisson s statistics to evaluate the adequacy of the various sky models to the data . the core algorithm developed to handle such a large system is described in @xcite .      a way to estimate the  emission spatial distribution over the galaxy ( i.e. the corresponding @xmath14 term in equation 1 ) is to represent it with some templates .",
    "in this study , we have used maps listed in table  [ table : tracers ] , similarly to @xcite for the  data .",
    "these maps , although the list is not exhaustive , emphasize some large - scale structures of the sky observed at particular wavelengths and associated to specific emission mechanisms that we may relate to the  emission .",
    "+ specific treatments have been applied to some of them : the a[@xmath23 and 4.9  maps are the nir 3.5 and 4.9@xmath24 maps corrected for reddening using nir 1.25@xmath24 map and averaging emission at latitude @xmath25 to estimate the zero level emission as explained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hence , the peak emission around the galactic center of the co map has been removed , while point - sources from the second egret catalog have been subtracted from the  map , together with an isotropic intensity of 1.5@xmath1 10@xmath27 ph  @xmath28  s@xmath29  sr@xmath29  to take into account the cosmic diffuse background radiation .",
    "+ we have introduced a parameter to quantify the difference between all these maps , the contrast , which we defined as the ratio of the flux contained in the region @xmath30 , @xmath31 to the total flux enclosed in @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this ratio varies from 0.4 , for the 25@xmath24 mir map , to almost 1 , for the 4.9 map . for reference , the egret map , which traces the interstellar gas / cosmic - ray emission ,",
    "has a contrast value of 0.7 .",
    "the maps up to egret ( left part of the x - axis of  figures  [ fig : rmlr ] and  [ fig : flux ] ) are said to have low - contrast and those above ( right part ) high - contrast .",
    "the instrumental background corresponds to a more or less isotropic component due to particles hitting the telescope or created inside its structure .",
    "it is the main contributor to the flux recorded by the detector plane and represents a key issue since the signal - to - noise ratios considered in this study are below 1@xmath7 .",
    "+ however , we have to note that the background term in equation ( 1 ) , formally consisting of @xmath34 values ( one per detector and per pointing ) , can be rewritten as : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is a vector of @xmath19 elements , representing the `` uniformity map '' of the detector plane ( background pattern ) , @xmath37 the effective observation time for detector d and pointing p. the evolution of the background intensity is traced with @xmath38 , a scalar normalization coefficient per pointing . assuming that @xmath36 is determined elsewhere , the number of unknowns ( free parameters ) in the set of @xmath21 equations is reduced to @xmath39 ( for a background intensity varying on the exposure timescale ) .",
    "however , the background intensity ( @xmath38 ) does not necessarily vary so rapidly and the number of related background parameters could be still decreased , according to the actual background evolution .",
    "+ we detail below both aspects ( detector pattern and timescale evolution ) of the background determination .",
    "figure  [ fig : bkgrate ] shows the mean count rate ( per detector ) evolution with time . in our standard analysis , we generally assume that the background varies with a fixed timescale .",
    "we have tested several timescales from one exposure ( @xmath5 2 - 3 ks ) to one revolution ( @xmath5 2 - 3 days ) and compared the results from a statistical point of view .",
    "figure  [ fig : bkgtimescale ] shows the evolution of several indicators as a function of the chosen timescale .",
    "the `` reduced chi - square '' is defined as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 stands for the likelihood equivalent chi - square equivalent statistics for poisson - distributed data , @xcite proposes the usage of the maximum likelihood ratio statistic @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the number of data points and @xmath44 is the model of the data @xmath45 .",
    "this is the cash statistic @xcite for poisson - distributed data ( low counts ) ; @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the likelihood function , within the constant term @xmath48 . ] and @xmath49 for the degrees of freedom .",
    "+ the reduced chi - square ( or similarly @xmath50 ) is rather stable for timescales less than 12 hours ; above , its value increases very quickly . as we aim to have as few as possible free parameters , in order to get a better conditioned system of equations",
    ", we can consider that a timescale of @xmath5 9 hours is a reasonable trade - off . in comparison , for the 505 - 516 kev band",
    ", we have concluded in @xcite that the best quality and robust results are obtained with a value of @xmath5 6 hours .",
    "note that the behavior of the above quantities does not depend on the assumed synthetic map nor on the pattern determination method ( section  [ sec_uniformity ] ) .",
    "+ however , to impose segments of fixed duration is convenient and easy , but not necessarily the best way to proceed since the background intensity can vary with various timescales along the mission .",
    "we have therefore applied a segmentation algorithm developed to determine the variability timescale of the sources @xcite to the background signal .",
    "we first subtracted the source contribution from the total counts .",
    "a rough approximation of the sky signal is enough for this purpose ( its contribution to the total counts is weak ) .",
    "then , for each exposure , counts are summed over all detectors , and for each revolution , the corresponding time - series ( up to one hundred of exposures ) is segmented .",
    "the number of segments and their lengths are adjusted in order to obtain the minimal number of segments ensuring @xmath51/dof @xmath52 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bkg_variable ] illustrates the case where the background intensity varies with different timescales along the revolution .",
    "+ the background intensity has been found stable ( fit with one segment ) during 477 over 1081 revolutions . finally , the total number of segments has been significantly reduced since only @xmath53000 segments are required to describe the whole dataset , instead of the @xmath512000 segments used when fixing a @xmath56 hours timescale . to compare qualitatively these results with those obtained with fixed timescales , we plot in figure  [ fig : bkgtimescale ] the statistical quantities corresponding to the background segmentation method with isolated symbols ( arbitrary abscissa since no fixed timescale ) .",
    "all of them point toward an improvement of the fit quality when the background variability is determined with a flexible timescale .",
    "finally , these ( quasi model - independent ) time segments have been used to describe the background evolution in our subsequent analyzes .",
    "the uniformity map or background pattern ( @xmath36 in equation 2 ) can be fixed by hand before the fitting procedure by using `` empty - field '' observations , thought to contain no source signal .",
    "the dedicated   `` empty - field '' observations are rare , but the exposures whose pointing latitude direction satisfies @xmath53 constitute a good approximation since they contain only weak contributions from sources , at the energies considered here .",
    "they amount to 20@xmath7 of the observations and have been used for building a set of background templates for different periods along the mission ( about one per 6 months ) .",
    "+ to quantify the properties of the background pattern for each period , we define the vector @xmath36 as @xmath54however , in the case of diffuse emission , the high - latitude exposure fields may contain some signal and the background pattern deduced from them may be `` blurred '' .",
    "more precisely , the high - latitude @xmath53 regions contain @xmath5 30@xmath7 to 40@xmath7 of the total emission for the `` low - contrast '' maps ( 12@xmath24 , 25@xmath24 and synchrotron ) while this ratio is less than 10@xmath7 for `` high - contrast '' ( egret to 4.9 maps ) ones .",
    "consequently , if the true emission distribution approaches the 25@xmath24 map , the detector pattern will be more affected by the high - latitude emission than if the true emission distribution follows the 4.9 map .",
    "note that the effect on the measured source flux is not predictable since the fit procedure adjusts background and source normalizations : a `` bad '' background pattern may imply an underestimation or an overestimation of the source flux .",
    "+ in addition , for the  study , we have to keep in mind that the side shields do not stop 100% of photons .",
    "this means that any uniformity map or background pattern will contain also some diffuse emission signal passing through the shield .",
    "+ we have investigated another approach to estimate the detector uniformity pattern , by fitting it during the convergence procedure .",
    "we have to note , in this case , that a prerequisite is to have a sufficient knowledge of the source contribution and that the background model relies on more free parameters . with this alternative method ,",
    "the @xmath41 decreases by @xmath558200 for @xmath56dof=411 additional parameters ( 2973 parameters are used to describe the background ) .",
    "however , the improvement of the @xmath41 criterion is not reliable enough since the recovered source signal becomes background dependent and can be altered to an extent which is difficult to estimate . + the two pattern determination methods are subsequently referred to as fixed - pattern and fitted - pattern ones , and we have systematically compared the results obtained with each of them .",
    "figure  [ fig : bkg_fluxes ] presents the  line flux obtained in the inner galaxy ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) for both pattern determination methods and several background variability timescales with the same model for the  distribution ( here the 60@xmath24 template ) . with the fixed - pattern method ,",
    "the recovered flux depends on the assumed background timescale , especially for background timescales below 6 hours , while its value remains unaffected when the background pattern is adjusted .",
    "it is worth noting that the same analysis has been applied to the annihilation radiation , at 511 kev .",
    "due to a better statistic and possibly a relatively less emission at high - latitudes , the fluxes obtained with the two pattern determination methods are perfectly compatible for each of the sky components , whatever the assumed background variation time - scales .",
    "+      although the model - fitting process provides the best quantitative information about the global emission and is better suited to determine its level of confidence , a direct `` imaging '' algorithm provides more qualitative information such as the position of potential emitting sources and their extent as well as some basic , but model independent , characteristics of the emission morphology .",
    "+ to build an image , the sky is divided into small areas or pixels , the flux @xmath59 in each pixel is to be determined .",
    "the linear model of the data derived from equation ( 1 ) is put in a more synthetic form through @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the data , @xmath62 the background , @xmath63 the response of the instrument as described in section  [ sec2:model ] and @xmath64 the statistical noise .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath64 are vectors of length @xmath43 ( the number of data points ) , @xmath59 a vector of length @xmath65 ( the number of pixels in the sky ) and @xmath63 a matrix of size @xmath43 by @xmath65 . the statistical noise is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with a variance @xmath66 and null mean .",
    "+ however , when the number of pixels is large , the system of equations becomes ill - conditioned ; the direct least - square solution is not always reliable and generally poorly informative . to select an informative and particular solution ,",
    "the most common technique consists in including a regularization term in the above system , in addition to the least square constraint .",
    "this solution , although biased by the choice of the regularization criterion , improves the conditioning of the system .",
    "a compromise between the goodness of the fit , quantified by @xmath51 , and the regularization , say @xmath67 , is found by maximizing the function @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a parameter , which determines the degree of smoothing of the solution .",
    "+ we choose to use one of the most popular regularization operators : the entropy function .",
    "this method is known as the maximum - entropy method or mem ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for an assumed positive additive distributions , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the default initial value assigned to the pixel @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath73 and @xmath71 are positive quantities .",
    "mem has been proved to be a successful technique for astronomical image reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is described in apppendix  [ appendixa ] . however , despite its capabilities , it suffers from several shortcomings : among them , the difficulty of selecting the appropriate entropy function distribution and the default pixel values .",
    "in addition , the possible correlations between pixels are not taken into account properly .",
    "one way to remedy this problem is described in section  [ mem_practical ] .      in our application",
    ", the instrumental background could be fixed through the modeling method presented in section  [ sec_background ] .",
    "however , such a modeling , even though being accurate enough for the model - fitting procedure , may be a source of biases for the image reconstruction , by preventing the appearance or by exaggerating the significance of some structures potentially present in the image .",
    "consequently , we prefer to have the possibility to refine the parameters linked to the background intensity during the image reconstruction process .",
    "the instrumental background variation timescale is fixed through the modeling method presented in section  [ sec_background ] .",
    "we search for both the solution vector @xmath59 ( length @xmath74 ) and the background intensities , @xmath62 ( length @xmath75 ) .",
    "we assume that the background parameters are precisely determined / constrained ( small error bars ) compared to sky pixels , hence they do not require any smoothing .",
    "note that the `` cross - talk '' effects between sky pixels and background parameters are reduced since the number of parameters to describe the background is nearly minimum ( section  [ sec_intensity ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the possible correlations between the pixels of the image ( the sky emission should vary smoothly from one pixel to the next ones ) are not taken into account properly with the entropy function .",
    "it is possible to introduce artificially such a correlation by using an intrinsic correlation function , icf , @xcite .",
    "the function to maximize becomes : @xmath76 for our work , we choose a radial gaussian function .",
    "such an icf takes part largely to the solution regularization by ensuring its smoothness .      in practice ,",
    "the sky is divided into pixels of equal area , following the healpix ( hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization of a sphere ) scheme @xcite , and initialized with a uniform default value . in a first step ,",
    "we consider a very low - resolution map ( 48 pixels of @xmath77 resolution ) and select the value of @xmath69 such that the reconstructed flux in the inner galaxy is comparable to the value obtained with the model - fitting procedure .",
    "the size of this problem is relatively small and a n - dimensional search - algorithm is used to maximize the function @xmath78 ( @xmath53000 parameters ) .",
    "the calculation of the first - order solution ( image and background parameters ) is based on a classical newton type optimization algorithm with a positivity constraint on the solution . during this first stage ,",
    "the background pattern is fixed .",
    "the resulting image is used as a template to compute an improved pattern which is then fixed for the rest of the process .",
    "we then use this solution as a starting point ( for an initial guess of the background parameters , the image is assumed to be flat ) to build a high - resolution image ( 49152 pixels of 0.9@xmath3 resolution ) through an algorithm similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 and the uniform sky default model are computed at each iteration so that the solution is ensured to follow the optimum mem trajectory ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) . at the end ,",
    "the final solution satisfies @xmath79 and fulfills an additional test on the degree of non - parallelism between the gradient of @xmath80 and @xmath67 ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "note that , the greater the number of iterations is , the lower the chi - square value but the image is more `` spiky '' .",
    "the above mentioned stopping criteria results probably in a \" spiky  , but also more objective image @xcite .",
    "the image displayed in figure  [ fig : image_alu ] indicates that the emission is essentially confined in the inner galaxy region ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , with a flux in the inner galaxy of 3.5@xmath81 .",
    "note that the morphology is drastically different from the electron - positron annihilation line emission one , which is essentially concentrated in the bulge region @xcite .",
    "+ beyond the morphology of the diffuse emission , our interest has been piqued by several spots visible in the image .",
    "simulations of image reconstruction ( appendix  [ appendixb ] ) show that structures with a peak intensity at @xmath5one - tenth of the image maximum intensity are probably due to residual statistical noise . above this level ,",
    "structures are worth being considered carefully .",
    "indeed , some of them have positions compatible with sources detected or studied during recent  investigations ( see section  [ region_excesses ] ) .",
    "for instance , the image reveals several excesses in the cygnus region ( 72@xmath82 , -7@xmath83 ) .",
    "a significant one is located at a position compatible with cyg ob2 cluster ( 81@xmath3,-1@xmath3 ) as reported by @xcite . in the sco - cen region ( 328@xmath84 , 8@xmath85 )",
    ", the strongest excess is localized at ( l , b ) @xmath86(360@xmath3 , 16@xmath3 ) , having a spatial extent with a radius of 5@xmath3 .",
    "some structures appear also around the carina and vela regions and two others , more extended , in the taurus / anticenter region ( 105@xmath87 , -15@xmath88 ) .",
    "finally , an additional spot detected above 3@xmath89 is worth investigating .",
    "however , a model - fitting analysis is required to extract more quantitative information on the above mentioned structures ( section  [ region_excesses ] ) .",
    "this analysis is similar to that done with the  data by @xcite , and consists of using template maps to model the spatial distribution of the  emission through the galaxy . in this case , only the intensity normalization is adjusted ( 1 parameter ) in addition to the background parameters . in practice , we fit the data with a combination of one of the maps listed in table  [ table : tracers ] plus a background model .",
    "the template preparation is detailed in section  [ sec_templates ] .",
    "+ to qualify the detection significance of the  emission for a given template , we adjust two models to the data : the first one contains only the background while the second contains the background plus the tested template map",
    ". quantitatively , the improvement of the likelihood is 512 for 1 additional parameter for the 25@xmath24 map ( best model ) and the background determined with the fixed - pattern method .",
    "the  flux detection significance is @xmath90 , and the associated reduced - chi - square is @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , each template leads to a significant flux detection .",
    "the worse case , h@xmath92 map , has a significance of @xmath93 .",
    "+ the same analysis with the fitted - pattern background determination gives an improvement of the likelihood of 312 ( for the 100@xmath24 map ) .",
    "the  flux detection significance is @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : rmlr ] displays the maximum likelihood ratio ( mlr ) obtained with both pattern determination methods ( fixed and fitted - pattern ) for each of the tested maps ( ordered by increasing contrast ) .",
    "several maps give similar results , leading to the conclusion that star - related distributions ( fir and mir maps , dust and free - free distributions , all with rather high - contrast ) give a good description of the data , as expected from what we know about the  emission process .",
    "similarly , 25@xmath24 and 12@xmath24 maps constitute good tracers , while presenting a low - contrast . in another hand ,",
    "h@xmath96 and 53 ghz synchrotron maps can be excluded .",
    "in fact , we have seen ( figure  [ fig : image_alu ] ) that the emission is confined into the central part of the galaxy and close to the disk .",
    "this explains why the h@xmath96 map does not provide a good fit to the data since it extends far in longitude and contains important emission at @xmath97 .",
    "we can also point out that distributions built by imaging method ( mem or mrem ) from  data appear as good tracers of the  emission , as expected . +",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : flux ] , the reconstructed flux attributed to the inner galaxy does not depend much on the template map and is compatible with a value of @xmath98 10@xmath99 , in agreement with the previously reported values .",
    "we observe that the flux is systematically higher by @xmath58 ( low - contrast maps ) to 20@xmath7 ( high - contrast maps ) when the fixed - pattern background determination method is used , but it has no scientific implication .",
    "however , the total flux integrated over the whole sky clearly depends on the contrast of the assumed model .",
    "the more the map is contrasted ( from left to right on figure  [ fig : flux ] ) , the weaker is the reconstructed total flux .",
    "this is due to the fact that the recovered global intensity relies on the central parts of the image ( both higher flux and signal to noise ratios ) and that a contrasted map encompasses less flux in its external parts than a flatter map .",
    "moreover , we are aware that low - contrast maps may suffer from significant `` cross - talk '' between the low - spatial frequency structure ( a kind of pedestal which mimics a flat low - surface brightness emission ) and the ( more or less uniform ) background contribution",
    ". + as an additional test , we have performed correlations between the direct image with 6@xmath6 resolution ( e.g. icf of 6@xmath100 fwhm ) and each of the templates downgraded to the same @xmath56@xmath100 spatial resolution ( except the dmr / cobe 53 ghz one , which originally has 7@xmath100 resolution ) .",
    "indeed , the linear correlation coefficient does not depend much on the template map and keeps a value greater than 0.9 in latitude , and above 0.7 in longitude , except the h@xmath101 map ( coefficient of 0.4 in longitude ) .",
    "+ finally , it appears that it is hard to firmly conclude about a unique solution .",
    "this reflects the difficulty of determining precisely such an extended weakly emitting structure and the similarity presented by most of the considered maps .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath51 curves follow the same evolution regardless the background determination method and hence that the conclusions do not depend on it .      to check quantitatively the significance of the most significant excesses and known  emitting regions , we have performed a more complete model - fitting analysis .",
    "note , however , that our analysis is not optimized for extended point - sources since a map contribution is necessarily subtracted at the position of the sources and , at worse , may make them disappear .",
    "+ the sky model consists of one of the templates listed in table  [ table : tracers ] , to which is added a spatial model including the spots . for the sources already detected or investigated at 1.8 mev",
    ", we have used the positions and spatial extensions provided by previous works ( vela @xcite , cygnus region @xcite , sco - cen @xcite , orion / eridanus , @xcite and carina @xcite , indicated in bold in table  [ table : tracers ] ) . to investigate the additional spots not yet referenced as  emitters ,",
    "the extent and location are based on the image analysis using simple models ( point - source , gaussian or disk ) .",
    "however , given their low - significance and the  spatial resolution of 2.6 @xmath3 , their identification with known sources is just indicative .",
    "we report in table 2 , the flux values obtained using the ic ( low - contrast ) and 4.9  ( high - contrast ) maps , as representative of the global results .",
    "+ the cyg ob2 cluster ( 81@xmath3,-1@xmath3 ) has a flux of ( @xmath102 ) similar to the value of ( @xmath103 )  obtained by @xcite and the ( @xmath104 )  obtained with  @xcite .",
    "we note also another excess at ( l , b)@xmath105(100@xmath3,6@xmath3 ) with a flux of ( 2.7 @xmath10 1.1 ) .",
    "+ strong emission has been reported in the sco - cen region by @xcite centered around ( l , b ) = ( 350@xmath3 , 20@xmath3 ) . at this position , we find a flux ( @xmath106 )  when using an @xmath107 map to model the large scale  emission .",
    "however in our image , the local maximum in this region appears shifted to ( l , b ) @xmath105(360@xmath3 , 16@xmath3 ) , and the source is less extended ( disk radius of 5@xmath3 instead of 10@xmath3 as reported by @xcite ) , while the flux remains at ( @xmath108 )  using again the @xmath107 map . on the another hand , in both cases",
    "the flux clearly depends on the template map used and is less than 2@xmath89 for most of the cases .",
    "+ the carina and vela regions are marginally detected ( 2@xmath89 ) .",
    "for carina , the measured flux of ( @xmath109 )  is comparable to the estimation of ( @xmath110 )  reported by @xcite using  data , and ( @xmath111 )  reported by @xcite using  data .",
    "for vela , the flux of ( @xmath112 )  is comparable to the value ( @xmath113 )  reported by @xcite using  data . for the orion - eridanus area ( 180@xmath114 , -30@xmath115 ) , we get an upper limit for the total flux of 3  ( 1 @xmath89 ) in agreement with the value of ( 4.5 @xmath10 2.1 ) obtained by @xcite from a synthesis model based on the orion star populations .",
    "we also mention the the 2@xmath89 upper limit of 1.7  reported by @xcite for the orion region using  instrument .",
    "+ concerning the spots not yet reported , we first point out two extended structures in the taurus / anticenter region ( 105@xmath87 , -15@xmath88 ) with fluxes of ( @xmath116 ) and ( @xmath117 ) . finally , a spot worth mentioning since it is detected above 3 @xmath89 , it is located at high - latitude ( l , b)@xmath105(226@xmath376@xmath3 ) with a flux of ( 7 @xmath10 2 ) .",
    "we did not find any convincing potential counterpart , but consider the stability of the attributed flux against the assumed  diffuse emission map as a good criterion to assess that an excess is robust and reliable .",
    "+ we did not notice any systematic effect in the source flux determination between the fixed and fitted background pattern adjustment method . note that adding all these excesses into the model of the sky improves the likelihood only marginally ( @xmath118 ) compared to the case where they are neglected , and that dedicated analyzes must be conducted to refine individually each result .",
    "while the intensity of the  isotope emissions at 1.173 and 1.333  mev contains important complementary information for the star evolution study , the weakness of the flux makes it impossible to derive any constraint on the spatial distribution .",
    "the latter is , therefore , assumed to be the same as the  line one ( section  [ maps_template_txt ] ) , which is physically reasonable since  and  are believed to be produced at least partly in the same sites ( e. g. , massive stars and supernovae , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ for this study , we followed basically the same procedure as for the  one .",
    "we analyzed the same dataset in the 1170 - 1176 and 1330 - 1336 kev bands , with the same templates to estimate the  flux .",
    "the background determination method ( section  [ sec_intensity ] ) leads to the identification of 2900 and 2961 time - segments respectively .",
    "note that the contribution of the  line through its interactions with the detectors ( compton effect , diffusion , ... ) has to be taken into account for the  analysis .",
    "being a strong line ,  photons can interact inside the camera through the compton effect and diffusion ( the instrument response is non - diagonal ) and produce a continuum from 20 kev to 1.8 mev in the data - space .",
    "this emission component is thus convolved with the instrument response to predict the corresponding counts in the data - space , and the predicted counts in the 1170 - 1176 and the 1330 - 1336 kev bands are included in the sky model during the  fluxes analysis .",
    "moreover , the contribution from the diffuse continuum has been taken into account assuming the power law model determined in a previous work @xcite .",
    "note that these effects are very small , well below the statistical error bars .",
    "+ for all the tested distributions , the  isotope lines are detected at a level of 2@xmath89 and 3@xmath89 respectively , in the 1170 - 1176 and 1330 - 1336 kev bands ( table  [ table : radiocativesbis ] ) .",
    "their global mean - flux in the inner galaxy is about 4 .",
    "systematics in the flux determination of these large - scale structures due to the background pattern determination method is below @xmath525@xmath7 for the  and around @xmath530@xmath7 for the  lines ( fluxes obtained with the fixed - pattern are systematically higher ) .",
    "+ as a conclusion , even though poorly constrained , the  to  ratio obtained during this analysis is around 0.14 , which agrees with values previously obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for more than a decade , the reference map for the spatial morphology of the   emission was provided by .",
    "several maps have been published , along the cgro mission , with more and more data , but also different analysis methods .",
    "consequently , while the extended morphology of the emission is assessed and results compatible , some local features not always appearing , depending on the method . indeed , the first mem images @xcite exhibit many low - intensity structures .",
    "a small number of them remain in the latest mem image @xcite , giving some confidence in their reliability . in parallel ,",
    "the chief features of these mem images were confirmed with a mrem algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is based on an iterative expectation maximization scheme and a wavelet filtering algorithm .",
    "this wavelet filter suppresses the low - significance features , which are potential artifacts , by applying a user - adjustable threshold .",
    "this aims to produce the smoothest image consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "note that the early mrem map built from  data by @xcite was too rough to bring any additional information compared to  ones .",
    "+ now that more than 10 years of  data are available , our main goal was to refine the  view of the  line emission at 1.8 mev and to investigate the related  lines around 1.2 and 1.3 mev . to study their spatial morphology ,",
    "we have developed specific tools .",
    "we have performed two kinds of image reconstructions .",
    "the first one is based on existing maps , at various wavelengths , which are used as a sky model , convolved with the instrument response and compared to the data ( model - fitting ) .",
    "the second one consists in direct sky reconstruction from the data , implying an inverse - problem . while the first method reveals the global large scale morphology of the emission , the latter allows us to look for small scale structures like local regions of  production .",
    "+ the  line is detected at @xmath119 , to compare to the @xmath120 obtained with the analysis of  data obtained in 5 years @xcite .",
    "+ in addition , comparing the mrem  image @xcite and  one , we report that a number of structures appear in both analyzes .",
    "note that the  sky exposition is non - uniform , mostly concentrated along the galactic plane and differs from the  one .",
    "thus ,  is more sensitive in the galactic plane than at high - latitudes , with a point - source ( 3 @xmath89 ) sensitivity of 1.4  in the galactic center region to be compared to the 0.8 to 1.4  reported by @xcite for .",
    "a first point to mention is that , for  as for , the background treatment is a tricky issue . in  data , to disentangle the signal and the instrumental background contributions , we rely on the ability of the instrument to measure simultaneously both of them , due to the properties of the coded - mask aperture imaging system .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the background intensity with time can be determined with a segmentation code developed specifically to take into account the background variation .",
    "the major advantage is that it strongly reduces the number of parameters related to the background . in a second step ,",
    "we determine the background detector pattern by assuming that high - latitude exposures constitute a good approximation of `` empty - fields '' .",
    "however , they may contain signal from the diffuse emission ( section  [ sec_uniformity ] ) we have thus implemented the possibility to determine the background pattern during the data - reduction process , assuming that the signal is sufficiently well known .",
    "the two approaches for background pattern determination have been compared to assess the robustness of the results , leading us to essentially the same conclusions regarding the  emission characteristics .",
    "+      in the model fitting analysis based on other wavelength maps , our data do not allow us to distinguish a unique preferred template since several ones lead to similar likelihood parameter values . from  data ,",
    "@xcite had concluded that the best tracers were dirbe 240@xmath24 and 53 ghz free - free maps .",
    "we agree that the fir maps with wavelengths 60 to 240 @xmath24 or 53 ghz ( free - free and dust ) appear statistically as the best estimates of the  emission global morphology but co , nir a[4.9@xmath24 ] and a[3.5@xmath24 ] extinction - corrected maps have also to be considered with only a slightly lesser degree of confidence .",
    "in addition , `` low - contrast '' maps observed at 25@xmath24 and 12@xmath24 provide an equally good description of the emission .",
    "+ indeed , our results confirm that the  emission follows more or less the distribution of the extreme population @xmath122 , the most massive stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is known that the massive stars , supernovae and novae produce the long - lived isotopes  and  with half - lives of 0.7 and 2.6 my . on the another hand , large amounts of dust / grains condense in core collapse sne ejecta while massive star - supernovae are major dust factories , therefore dust fir and mir maps are expected to correlate with the corresponding emissions .",
    "+ quantitatively , the flux extracted through the model fitting method for the inner galaxy ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) is found to be around 3.3@xmath1 10@xmath2 while it does not depend much on the sky model ( particularly if we restrict ourselves to the preferred ones ) .",
    "this flux is consistent with earlier measurements of both  and  instruments and corresponds to a total  mass contained in our galaxy of @xmath53@xmath123,(but , see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite using a  light - bucket  method obtain a flux of 4 @xmath1 10@xmath99 for the region delimited by @xmath124,@xmath125 . for the same region ,",
    "we obtain a flux of @xmath5 3.9 @xmath1 10@xmath2with the most probable spatial morphologies .",
    "+ another observable quantity , related to  production , is the ratio between  and  line fluxes in the inner galaxy . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the  to  flux ratio provides a test for stellar models , as predictions of the yields of massive stars depend strongly on the prescription of nuclear rates , stellar winds , mixing and rotation @xcite . with our analysis ,",
    "the  mean flux in the inner galaxy is about 4 , leading to a  to  ratio between 0.12 and 0.15 . considering the uncertainties still affecting the models",
    ", this results confirms those reported by @xcite , and can be used to reject some hypotheses , but not yet to definitively discriminate the good ones .      to go further in the details of the emission distribution",
    ", the flux extraction must be independent of any template , and rely on a direct imaging reconstruction of the  emission . to realize it , we chose the mem tool because of its ability to process high - resolution images .",
    "our mem code is based on @xcite algorithm .",
    "the main improvement we implemented to the basic algorithm is the possibility to refine the background determination during the iterative computation of the solution .",
    "+ the resulting  image presented in figure  [ fig : image_alu ] resembles the mem  images in term of angular resolution and details . with a resolution fixed to @xmath56@xmath3",
    ", it gives essentially the same information as the previous method , i.e. the emission is mainly confined in the inner - galaxy disk ( with @xmath126 ) .",
    "but , it also suggests the presence of extended ( a few degrees ) emitting areas and makes it quite instructive to compare the main features with those observed in  maps : several excesses appear in both  and  data analyzes of @xcite , which reinforces their reliability see ( table  [ table : emission_regions ] ) .",
    "+ in the cygnus region , cyg ob2 cluster detection has been reported in  and  data @xcite .",
    "we find at the same position a flux of @xmath127  compatible with the value of @xmath103  reported by @xcite and @xmath104 )  reported by @xcite .",
    "however , a more complete analysis based on the excesses visible in the image reveals several spots in the cygnus region and around ( table 2 ) , suggesting a complex structure of this area . +",
    "the vela and carina regions are detected , in our work , at a low significance level ( 2@xmath89 ) .",
    "for vela , the measured flux is comparable to the value reported by @xcite . for carina ,",
    "the flux is comparable to the estimation of @xcite using  data and @xcite using  data .",
    "+ in the sco - cen region , emission , not detected in the  data , was reported in the  data at a high significance level ( @xmath128 ) by @xcite with a somewhat different analysis . using their location and spatial extension , we find a flux of @xmath129 in the most favorable case ( the flat h@xmath92 map used to model the diffuse large - scale emission ) . in our image",
    ", the excess appears shifted and less extended ( table 2 ) .",
    "moreover , the measured flux depends strongly on the template used to model the large - scale emission of the  line .",
    "this lead us to consider that this result requires additional work to be confirmed .",
    "+ on the other hand , we pick up significant and robust excesses , not explicitly reported by the  team .",
    "two of them , rather extended , are seen in the taurus / anticenter region at ( l , b)@xmath130 ( 161@xmath3,-3@xmath3 ) and ( l , b)@xmath130 ( 149@xmath3 , 8@xmath3 ) with fluxes of @xmath131  and @xmath132 .",

    "a third feature appears at high - latitude ( ( @xmath133 ) ) .",
    "obviously , we can not exclude that this spot is due to statistical data noise , but its stability against the various analysis methods supports its reliability .",
    "+ we have to point out that the present analysis has been optimized for large scale emissions ( handling the all - sky data set ) while any `` local '' analysis requires a dedicated procedure .",
    "briefly , in this case , we have to use the exposures whose pointing direction are not too far from the source or region of interest ( less than @xmath134 ) and to refine the sky model , to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "+ @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have proposed an interpretation of the  emission by linking enhanced emission spots to the galactic spiral arms .",
    "this relation has been confirmed with the observation of the line shift along the galactic plane in the  data @xcite .",
    "some of the identified regions match excesses we point out in our analysis , reinforcing the reliability of the emissions and supporting the proposed scenario ( labeled with  *  in table 2 ) .",
    "+ to conclude , the  instrument gives us one of the rare opportunities to get pieces of information about the spatial distribution of  line and the nucleosynthesis process .",
    "fifteen years after the first results obtained by , we confirm the chief features as well as some of the low - intensity structures reported by this instrument through direct - imaging of the sky and templates comparison .",
    "while we can not hope to increase significantly the amount of data recorded by  ( more than 10 years of observation have been included in the presented analysis ) , some improvements in the data analysis appear achievable to still refine our results . in particular , an accurate modeling of the response outside the field of view is a prime objective for studying emissions above @xmath5 1 mev together with the analysis of the multiple events , which contain @xmath520@xmath7 of the @xmath135-ray photons .",

    "it consists in choosing , at each iteration , three search - directions @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 derived from the gradients @xmath165 and @xmath166 , as well as from the matrix of curvature of c , @xmath167 . in this way , the n - dimensional problem is reduced to a three - dimensional problem .",
    "the three search - directions , by using the metric given by equation  [ eq : a8 ] , are @xmath168 the entropy metric is used to define the lengths @xmath169^{1/2},~|\\nabla c|=[\\sum f^i ( \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial f^i})^2]^{1/2 }   % \\label{eq : a10}\\ ] ] the solution is updated by adding the increment vector as follows @xmath170 the values to be found are the lengths @xmath171 ( @xmath24=1,2,3 ) along the search directions @xmath172 . for this purpose , @xmath67 and @xmath80 are modeled by their taylor 2 -order expansions @xmath173 and @xmath174 at the current solution @xmath59 @xmath175 where @xmath176 after simultaneous diagonalisation of the quadratic models of h and c , in a common basis , formed by the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath177 computed on the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath178 , one obtains : @xmath179 where @xmath180 are the eigenvalues of @xmath178 .",
    "this is a low - dimensional problem and standard algorithms can perform these operations .",
    "according to the maximum - entropy trajectory ( @xmath181 as defined in equation  [ eq : a5 ] ) , the step - lengths are @xmath182 sb84 introduce explicitly the distance constraint into the optimization process.the quadratic model of @xmath78 becomes @xmath183 then , the step - lengths @xmath184 are given by @xmath185 in sb84 , @xmath186 can be interpreted as an artificial increase of each eigenvalue @xmath187 of c. the equivalent quadratic model of @xmath80 is @xmath188      the control of the convergence of the algorithm is performed directly on the constraint c , and not on the lagrange multiplier @xmath189 .",
    "the aim is to maximize @xmath190 over @xmath191 .",
    "the minimum reachable value of @xmath80 is @xmath192 sb84 recommend to have a more modest aim @xmath193 , for example @xmath194 @xmath195 is an increasing function of @xmath69 .",
    "the simultaneous control of @xmath195 and @xmath196 is done through the value of @xmath186 , @xmath195 is an increasing function and @xmath196 a decreasing function of @xmath186 . by adjusting the values of @xmath69 and @xmath186",
    ", one can reach the aimed result .",
    "the procedure is detailed in sb84 .",
    "in the  historical  version of the maximum - entropy , this process is repeated until @xmath80 reaches the stopping value @xmath43 .",
    "sb84 suggest to reach at least a value lower than the largest acceptable value at 99 % confidence , about @xmath197 where @xmath43 is the number of observations .",
    "+ equation  [ eq : a5 ] forces the gradients @xmath149h and @xmath149c to be parallel .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath69 can be interpreted as the ratio of their lengths .",
    "in addition , the algorithm is always checked by measuring the degree of non - parallelism between @xmath198 and @xmath199 through the value of @xmath200 the value is zero for a true maximum entropy image .",
    "sb84 indicate that reaching @xmath201 or so at the correct value of c , demonstrates that the unique maximum - entropy reconstruction has been attained . + in our application , we always reached @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "the function @xmath80 always decreases when the iteration number increases . from a number of iterations ,",
    "the value of test starts to decrease in a monotonic way and reaches a minimum value . from this point ,",
    "its value becomes almost stable and in the worst case increases slightly whereas there is essentially no progress in the decrease of the value of @xmath204 .",
    "in addition , we compare the function c to its quadratic approximation to ensure its validity . to achieve and maintain this constraint during the iterations ,",
    "the length of the increment ( equation  [ eq : a7 ] ) is kept small enough , this results in a larger iteration number . in general , 30 to 50 iterations are required ( less if the increment constraint is higher or relaxed at any given number of iterations , but at the expense of an inaccurate 2nd - order approximation of c ) .",
    "different choices of c ( f ) are possible @xcite .",
    "we used a modified version of the @xmath51 statistic , accurate for low numbers of counts , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the image model is computed at each iteration as @xmath205",
    "to simulate synthetic data , we rely on the model - fitting analysis . a given template map is used to model the distribution of the  line over the galaxy ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "expected counts are obtained by convolving this sky model with the instrument response and then adding the background model .",
    "the intensity of the map and the intensity variations of the background are the parameters which are adjusted to the recorded data .",
    "+ our simulations start from the predicted counts .",
    "poisson statistical fluctuations are added to them to build the simulated data , which are in turn analyzed similarly as the real data .",
    "we simulated data from the mrem template , which represents a smooth input map , and egret template , which is a more structured .",
    "the input maps and their reconstruction are displayed on figure  [ fig : appendixb ] .",
    "we present two image reconstructions which differ in the resolution of the final image , forced to the values of 3@xmath6 and 6@xmath6 ( fwhm ) . in all cases ,",
    "the fluxes simulated and measured in the inner galaxy are recovered within 5@xmath7 for both mrem and egret simulated maps . from these simulations , we conclude that statistical noise produces structures whose intensity can reach about one - tenth of the image maximum intensity . above this value",
    ", there are no particular structures created during the image reconstruction process at any particular position .",
