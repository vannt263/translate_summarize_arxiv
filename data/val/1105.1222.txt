    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) was a large water cherenkov detector optimized for detecting solar neutrinos created from the @xmath1b reaction in the main @xmath2 fusion chain .",
    "in addition to solar neutrinos , the sudbury neutrino observatory was also sensitive to high - energy muons that traverse the volume of the detector .",
    "a small fraction of these events are neutrino - induced muons from atmospheric neutrinos , while the large remaining fraction come from cosmic rays created in the upper atmosphere .",
    "it is possible to discriminate between these muon sources by looking at the angular distribution of incoming muons .",
    "the combination of large depth and the relatively flat topography in the vicinity of the detector attenuates almost all cosmic ray muons entering the detector at zenith angle @xmath3 .",
    "the study of muon events in the sno detector provides measurements of the absolute flux of atmospheric neutrinos and constraints on the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite . while the latter measurement is more strongly constrained by other experiments  @xcite ,",
    "the former is unique to the sno experiment .    to facilitate a clean measurement of the zenith distribution of muons entering the sno fiducial volume ,",
    "an accurate understanding of the muon reconstruction algorithm is necessary .",
    "this includes both the angular and spatial resolution of high - energy muons which enter the detector . determining the accuracy of the muon tracking reconstruction algorithm",
    ", however , relies almost entirely on monte carlo simulations .",
    "although the detector response to muons was benchmarked against selected cosmic - ray data , there is not an external calibration source that can provide a consistency - check to the accuracy of the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case for sno s response to neutrons and low energy electrons , which was calibrated with multiple sources to a precision of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper a means by which the sno experiment was able to calibrate its muon tracking algorithm via the use of an external muon tracking system .",
    "the external muon system ( emus ) allowed sno to simultaneously reconstruct selected cosmic - ray events in two independent systems , thereby providing a cross - check on the tracking algorithm .",
    "the emus experiment ran for a total of 94.6 live days during the last phase of the sno experiment .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : section [ sec : sno ] describes the main sno experiment , section  [ sec : fti ] describes the sno muon reconstruction algorithm , section  [ sec : emus ] describes the characteristics of the emus apparatus , section  [ sec : data_selection ] describes the criterion for accepting events , and finally section  [ sec : recon ] discusses the analysis used to calibrate the sno tracking algorithm against data taken with the emus system .",
    "the sno detector consisted of a 12-meter - diameter acrylic sphere filled with 1 kiloton of d@xmath7o .",
    "the 5.5-cm - thick acrylic vessel was surrounded by 7.4 kilotons of ultra - pure h@xmath7o encased within a barrel - shaped cavity , 34 m in height and 22 m in diameter .",
    "a 17.8-meter - diameter geodesic structure surrounded the acrylic vessel and supported 9456 20-cm - diameter photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) pointed toward the center of the detector .",
    "a non - imaging light concentrator was mounted on each pmt to increase the effective photocathode coverage to 54%  @xcite .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "sno was located in the vale creighton mine in ontario , canada at a depth of 2.092 km ( @xmath8 meters water equivalent ) with a flat overburden . at this depth ,",
    "the muon rate incident over the geodesic sphere and integrated over the seasonal variation is @xmath9/day across an impact area of 216 m@xmath10@xcite .",
    "muons entering the detector produce cherenkov light at an angle of 42@xmath0 with respect to the propagation direction of the muon . cherenkov light and light from delta rays produced by the muon illuminate an average of 5500 pmts , whose charge and timing information are recorded .",
    "the amplitude and timing response of the pmts were calibrated _ in situ _ using a light diffusing sphere illuminated by a laser at six distinct wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this laser ball calibration was of particular relevance to the muon fitter because it provides a timing and charge calibration for multiple photon hits on a single pmt .",
    "other calibration sources used in sno are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "data taking in the sno experiment was subdivided into three distinct phases for measurement of the solar neutrino flux . in the first phase , the experiment ran with pure d@xmath7o only .",
    "the solar neutral current reaction was observed by detecting the 6.25 mev @xmath11-ray following the capture of the neutron by a deuteron . for the second phase of data taking , approximately 0.2% by weight of purified nacl",
    "was added to the d@xmath7o volume to enhance the sensitivity to neutrons via their capture on @xmath12cl . in the third and final phase of the experiment ,",
    "40 discrete @xmath13he and @xmath14he proportional tubes were inserted within the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "this enhanced the neutron capture cross - section to make an independent measurement of the neutron flux , by observing neutron capture on @xmath13he in the proportional counters .",
    "results from the measurements of the solar neutrino flux for these phases have been reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the sno muon reconstruction algorithm fits for a through - going muon track based on the charge , timing , and spatial distribution of triggered pmts . using a maximum likelihood method , the fitter is able to determine a variety of muon tracking parameters , including the muon s propagation direction , impact parameter with respect to the center of sno , the total deposited energy , and a timing offset .",
    "the likelihood is defined as : @xmath15 \\label{eq : fti_lh}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of detected photons , @xmath17 is the probability of @xmath16 photoelectrons being detected for @xmath18 expected number of detected photoelectrons , @xmath19 is the probability of seeing charge @xmath20 given @xmath16 photon hits , and @xmath21 is the probability of observing a pmt trigger at time @xmath22 given @xmath16 photon hits .",
    "the heart of the fitter lies in the first probability term , which is calculated based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "muons were simulated at discrete impact parameter values with random directions through the detector .",
    "these simulations were used to create lookup tables for how many photoelectrons are expected to be detected by a pmt at a given position with respect to a muon track with a given impact parameter .",
    "the second term further refines the fit by including the charge information from the pmts , and allows an estimate of the total energy deposited by the muon , correcting for offline pmts and the neck of the detector .",
    "this probability was calculated by simulating multiple photon hits on all of the pmts in sno . for a given number of photon hits ,",
    "the resulting charge distribution is modeled as an asymmetric gaussian with the widths extracted from simulations .",
    "this fit model agrees well with the simulations for many photon hits , and acceptably for few photon hits ( see figure  [ fig : q_prob ] ) .",
    "the third term in the likelihood refines the fit by including the pmt timing . for each pmt",
    ", the time residual can be calculated as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the recorded time on a given pmt , @xmath25 is the time offset term in the likelihood fit , @xmath26 is the distance the muon travels within the detector before emitting the cherenkov photon , @xmath27 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath28 is the distance the cherenkov photon traveled , and @xmath29 is the average speed of light in d@xmath7o / h@xmath7o medium ( 21.8 cm / ns )",
    ". the cherenkov photon is assumed to have an angle of @xmath30 with respect to the muon track , making @xmath26 and @xmath28 well - defined .",
    "the probability of the time residual is modeled as a gaussian centered at zero with corrections to include estimates of prepulsing and late light as a function of the number of photon hits .",
    "the sno muon fitter maximizes the likelihood function for the impact parameter , direction , deposited energy , and timing offset using the method of simulated annealing with downhill simplex  @xcite . after determining the parameters that maximize the likelihood , a set of data",

    "the results from the fit are given in table  [ tab : muon_recon ] . ]    the muon fitter is found to have good reconstruction accuracy on simulated muons .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcang ] shows the angle @xmath31 between the monte carlo generated muon direction ( @xmath32 ) and the reconstructed muon direction ( @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 this is fit to a weighted double gaussian function : @xmath35 \\label{eq : xtwogaus1}\\ ] ]    the additional @xmath36-dependence is introduced in order to account for the phase space available .",
    "the fit parameters are summarized in table [ tab : muon_recon ] .",
    "although the tails are non - gaussian , this fit gives a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty for the angular resolution .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : ang_noshift ] shows the results of applying the two assumptions to the 30 reconstructed emus - sno events .",
    "the data are fitted to the functional forms of equations  [ eq : xtwogaus1 ]  and  [ eq : twogaus1 ] . due to the small number of events , the weights and relative widths of the secondary gaussians",

    "the impact parameter bias is @xmath43 cm , while fit impact parameter width is @xmath44 cm .",
    "the combined data from the sno detector and the external muon system have demonstrated that the sno muon reconstruction algorithm is accurate to the level needed by the neutrino - induced atmospheric flux analysis .",
    "the emus analysis places a constraint on the angular reconstruction to better than @xmath42 and on the impact parameter bias to better than @xmath43 cm .",
    "the latter constraint is in good agreement with other methods using cosmic - ray data in sno  @xcite .",
    "we believe the method employed here is a unique , low - cost way to explicitly verify the validity of muon track reconstruction for deep underground experiments .",
