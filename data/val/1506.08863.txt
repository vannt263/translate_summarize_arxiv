    "as a packet of ionizing radiation ( @xmath9ryd ) traverses the universe , it has a high probability of encountering a slab of optically thick , gas . for sources in the @xmath10 universe",
    "the mean free path is only @xmath11mpc ( physical ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e.  less than 2%  of the event horizon .",
    "observationally , researchers refer to this optically thick gas as lyman limit systems ( llss ) owing to their unmistakable signature of continuum opacity at the lyman limit ( @xmath12 ) in the system restframe .",
    "a fraction of this gas lies within the dense , neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies , yet the majority of opacity must arise from gas outside the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the interplay between galaxies and the lls is a highly active area of research which includes studies of the so - called circumgalactic medium ( cgm ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for many decades",
    ", lls have been surveyed in quasar spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , albeit often from heterogeneous samples .",
    "these works established the high incidence of llss which evolves rapidly with redshift . with the realization of massive spectral datasets ,",
    "a renaissance of lls surveys has followed yielding statistically robust measurements from homogenous and well - selected quasar samples @xcite .",
    "analysis of these hundreds of systems reveals an incidence of approximately 1.2 systems per unit redshift at @xmath4 that evolves steeply with redshift @xmath13 for @xmath14 @xcite . with these same spectra",
    ", researchers have further measured the mean free path of ionizing radiation (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which sets the intensity and shape of the extragalactic uv background .",
    "following the redshift evolution of the lls incidence ,  also evolves steeply with the expanding universe , implying a more highly ionized universe with advancing cosmic time @xcite .",
    "the preponderance of llss bespeaks a major reservoir of baryons .",
    "in particular , given the apparent paucity of heavy elements within galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the llss may present the dominant reservoir of metals in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , a precise calculation of the heavy elements within llss and their contribution to the cosmic budget has not yet been achieved . despite our success at surveying hundreds of llss",
    ", there have been few studies resolving their physical properties and these have generally examined a few individual cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or composite spectra @xcite .",
    "this reflects both the challenges related to data acquisition and analysis together with a historical focus in the community towards the ism of galaxies ( probed by dlas ) and the more diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) . at @xmath15 ,",
    "a few works have examined the set of llss with high column density ( @xmath16 ) , generally termed the super - llss or sub - damped  systems .",
    "their  frequency distribution  and chemical abundances have been analyzed from a modestly sized sample @xcite . ignoring ionization corrections , which may not be justified , these sllss exhibit metallicities of approximately 1/10 solar , comparable to the enrichment level of the higher- , damped systems ( dlas ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a few llss have received special attention owing to their peculiar metal - enrichment @xcite and/or the detection of d for studies of big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most recently , a sample of 15 llss has been surveyed for highly ionized absorption @xcite , which is present at a high rate .",
    "a comprehensive study of the absorption - line properties of the llss at high redshift , however , has not yet been performed .",
    "scientifically , we have two primary motivations to survey the llss at @xmath15 . first and foremost , we aim to dissect the physical nature of the gas that dominates the opacity to ionizing radiation in the universe .",
    "one suspects that these llss trace a diverse set of overdense structures ranging from galactic gas to the densest filaments of the cosmic web .",
    "such diversity may manifest in an wide distribution of observed properties ( e.g.  metal enrichment , ionization state , kinematics ) .",
    "second , modern theories of galaxy formation predict that the gas fueling star formation accretes onto galaxies in cool , dense streams ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiative transfer analysis of hydrodynamic simulations of this process predict a relatively high cross - section of optically thick gas around galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , an optically thick cgm envelops the massive galaxies hosting @xmath17 quasars @xcite , llss are observed near lyman break galaxies @xcite , and such gas persists around present - day @xmath18 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the latter has inspired , in part , surveys of the llss at @xmath19 with ultraviolet spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus motivated , we have obtained a large dataset of high - dispersion spectroscopy on @xmath20 quasars at the keck and las campanas observatories .",
    "we have supplemented this program with additional spectra obtained to survey the damped  systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , we present the comprehensive dataset of column density measurements on over 150  llss .",
    "future manuscripts will examine the metallicity , chemical abundances , kinematics , and ionization state of this gas .",
    "this manuscript is outlined as follows : section  [ sec : data ] describes the dataset analyzed including a summary of the observations and procedures for generating calibrated spectra .",
    "we define an lls in section  [ sec : define ] and detail the procedures followed to estimate the column densities in section  [ sec : nhi ] .",
    "section  [ sec : ionic ] presents measurements of the ionic column densities and the primary results of an empirical assessment of these data are given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "this section describes the steps taken to generate a large dataset of high - dispersion , calibrated spectra of high redshift llss .",
    "the sample presented in this manuscript is intended to be a nearly , all - inclusive set of llss discovered in the high - dispersion ( echelle or echellette ; @xmath21 ) spectra that we have gathered at the keck and magellan telescopes . regarding keck ,",
    "we have examined all of the data obtained by principal investigators ( pis ) a.m. wolfe and j.x .",

    "keck observatory through april 2012 , and from pis burles , omeara , bernstein , and fumagalli at magellan through july 2012 .",
    "we also include the keck spectra analyzed by @xcite .",
    "each spectrum was visually inspected for the presence of damped  absorption and/or a continuum break at wavelengths @xmath22  in the quasar rest - frame .",
    "the complex combination of spectral s / n , wavelength coverage , and quasar emission redshift  leads to a varying sensitivity to an lls .",
    "no attempt is made here to define a statistical sample , e.g. to assess the random incidence of llss nor their frequency distribution .",
    "we refer the reader to previous manuscripts on this topic @xcite . because our selection is based solely on absorption",
    ", however , we believe the sample is largely unbiased with respect to other properties of the gas , e.g.  metal - line absorption , kinematics , ionization state .",
    "the sample was limited during the survey by : ( 1 ) generally ignoring llss with absorption redshifts within 3000  of the reported quasar redshift , so - called proximate lls or plls ; and ( 2 ) generally ignoring llss with @xmath23 , especially when the s / n was poor near the lyman limit .",
    "we note further that many of the keck spectra were obtained to study damped  systems ( dlas ) at @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have ignored systems targeted as dlas and also absorbers within @xmath25 of these dlas because the dla system complicates analysis of the lyman series and metal - line transitions of any nearby lls . in @xmath26  [",

    "our approach to identifying lls and estimating their  values involved two relatively distinct procedures . for lls with large  values ( @xmath43 ) , we searched each spectrum for absorption features with large equivalent widths  characteristic of a damped  line ( i.e. @xmath44 ) .",
    "we then considered whether these candidates could be related to a broad absorption line ( bal ) system associated to the background quasar or  associated to a higher redshift dla .",

    "although this procedure is rife with human interaction , we maintain that it offers the most robust assessment ( to date ) for  estimation .",

    "this was partly motivated by the expectation that the majority of llss are predominantly ionized and therefore physically distinct from the neutral gas comprising dlas .",
    "it was also motivated by the desire to examine this optically thick gas separately from the decades of research on the dlas .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath142 criterion is primarily an observationally defined boundary and one may gain insight into the nature of the llss through a combined comparison .",
    "such analysis has been performed previously for the slls by @xcite .",
    "we consider two such comparisons here .",
    "figure  [ fig : xh_lls_dla ] presents the  and  measurements for the hd - lls sample together with measurements from the sample of dlas of @xcite .",

    "the dla measurements extend in a roughly continuous manner from the measurements of the llss . indeed , comparing the samples of dla measurements with the sllss ( taking limits at their values )",
    ", one observes overlapping distributions with similar median values .",
    "the only notable distinction , perhaps , is the small set of llss with @xmath144 and high  values ( exceeding 0dex for si@xmath2 ) .",
    "this suggests a higher incidence of highly enriched gas in the lls , although we caution it could be partly an effect of ionization .",

    "one notable and surprising difference is that the sllss show a higher incidence of low columns of c@xmath100 and si@xmath100 . despite tracing predominantly neutral gas",
    ", the dlas also mark a reservoir of highly ionized gas that frequently exceeds the medium encompassing the llss .",

    ", the dla distribution extends in a nearly continuous manner from the upper end of the lls data and the column density distributions for the sllss and dlas are similar .",
    "together , figures  [ fig : xh_lls_dla ] and [ fig : high_lls_dla ] lend support to scenarios that envision llss as the outer layers of gas surrounding dlas , i.e.  these systems frequently sample the same structures .",
    "such physical associations may be examined by studying dlas and llss along pairs of quasar sightlines , an active area of research @xcite .",
    "examining the high - ion comparison further , there is at least one import distinction : the llss and especially the sllss show a much higher incidence of low @xmath145 and @xmath146 values .",
    "this is unexpected given that ( i ) the llss trace highly ionized gas ; ( ii ) the dlas trace predominantly neutral gas that is physically distinct from the high - ions @xcite .",
    "the results presented here indicate that the gas layers giving rise to dlas are embedded in a reservoir of highly ionized gas that frequently exceeds the typical surface density in llss .",
    "this follows previous work which has inferred high quantities of both neutral and ionized gas for the dlas @xcite .",
    "it further suggests that high - ions more closely trace higher density regions in the universe and/or may reflect a difference in the masses of the dark matter halos hosting llss and dlas .",
    "lastly , we have compared our measurements against the small set of literature values for sllss at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the low - ion column densities are typically larger in those publications , consistent with the higher  values of the sllss that were sampled .",
    "we have constructed a sample of  llss at @xmath147 observed at high - dispersion with spectrometers on the keck and magellan telescopes which constitute the hd - lls sample . in this manuscript , we present the complete sample and present column density measurements of and associated metal absorption . for the latter ,",
    "analysis was restricted to transitions redward of the  forest and has focused on commonly detected species .",
    "these measurements and the associated spectra are made available online with this publicationxavier / lls ] .",
    "this constitutes , by roughly an order of magnitude , the largest high redshift sample of lls analyzed in this manner .",
    "we have explored empirical trends in the column density measurements and report statistically significant ( @xmath98 ) correlations between the low - ion ( e.g.  si@xmath2 , c@xmath2 ) columns and .",
    "high - ion species ( si@xmath100 , c@xmath100 ) are detected in nearly all llss and their column densities also correlated with .",
    "examining ionic ratios sensitive to the ionization state ( e.g.  c@xmath100/c@xmath2 , si@xmath100/si@xmath2 ) , we conclude that the llss are predominantly ionized with more highly ionized gas in lower systems",

    "only a small subset ( @xmath148 ) of the hd - lls sample have no positive detections of associated metals , consistent with primordial abundances .",
    "none of the llss with @xmath149 are ` metal - free ' .",
    "we conclude that a very high percentage of high - density gas at @xmath4 was previously enriched to @xmath150 solar abundance .",
    "the hd - lls sample also exhibits a small subset ( @xmath151 ) of llss that have solar or super - solar enrichment . these likely represent the most enriched gas reservoirs in the high redshift universe .",
    "lastly , we have examined several ionic ratios that are sensitive to the nucleosynthetic enrichment history of the gas .",
    "the preponderance of elevated si@xmath2/fe@xmath2 and o@xmath3/fe@xmath2 measurements suggest the llss have an @xmath6-enhancement characteristic of type  ii nucleosynthesis .",
    "in contrast , the si@xmath2/c@xmath2 and al@xmath2/c@xmath2 ratios are consistent with solar relative abundances .",
    "future manuscripts on the hd - lls sample will : ( i ) study the metallicity distribution of the llss accounting for ionization effects and will estimate the contribution of optically thick gas to the cosmic metal budget ; ( ii ) examine the kinematic characteristics to constrain the physical origin of the gas ; ( iii ) offer constraints on the  frequency distribution for optically thick gas .",
