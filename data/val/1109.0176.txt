    "a large series of results on @xmath0 production in proton - nucleus  @xcite and nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite has been compiled in the low energy region .",
    "although different nuclear models have been used to describe these data  @xcite , the crucial ingredients in any theoretical interpretation must be the cross sections for strangeness production in proton - proton and proton - neutron reactions .",
    "parameterizations of the existing experimental data , or calculations within a meson - exchange model  @xcite , have generally been employed for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "there are three strangeness - conserving @xmath0 production channels that are open in @xmath1 collisions close to threshold .",
    "the one that has been most widely investigated is @xmath4 , for which data on the total cross section , dalitz plots , and angular spectra have been published  @xcite . in the @xmath5 case ,",
    "values of the total cross sections  @xcite and angular distributions  @xcite are available .",
    "parameterizations  @xcite of the energy dependence of the total cross sections for @xmath6 and @xmath7 production are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : totcr ] alongside the available experimental data .",
    "measurements also exist of the @xmath8 total cross section  @xcite and studies of the @xmath9 channel have been undertaken  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , very little is known experimentally about @xmath0 production in proton - neutron collisions .",
    "there are a few @xmath10 data points obtained with a neutron beam  @xcite , though only at 3.4  gev and above .",
    "there seem to be no measurements of the @xmath11 or @xmath12 reaction channels recorded in the literature .",
    "however , some data on @xmath13 have been obtained using the cosy - anke spectrometer  @xcite and results on the @xmath14 reaction close to threshold should eventually be available from this facility  @xcite as will @xmath15 from the cosy - tof spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to deduce the ratio of @xmath0 production in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions , @xmath16 , by analyzing data obtained using different nuclear targets and beams .",
    "the rather inconclusive value of @xmath17 was obtained with a 3  gev proton beam incident on a range of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath0 production rate on a naf target with proton and deuteron beams of energy 2.1  gev per nucleon yielded a ratio @xmath18 , from which it was concluded that @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of double - differential @xmath0 production cross sections measured with carbon and hydrogen targets at 2.5  gev was interpreted as evidence that @xmath20  @xcite . however , an analysis of the double - differential cross section for @xmath0 production with a 2.02  gev proton beam incident on a deuterium target gave the much larger but very model - dependent estimate of @xmath21  @xcite .    in the absence of reliable experimental proton - neutron data , it is interesting to see if theory can offer any guidance .",
    "the models that have been used are mainly of the one - meson - exchange variety , though these are very uncertain even for the @xmath22 reaction since there is no consensus as to which exchanges need to be included .",
    "the results of the cosy - tof collaboration , and in particular the evidence for the excitation of @xmath23 isobars , suggest the dominance of non - strange meson exchange  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , measurements of the spin - transfer parameter @xmath24 have been interpreted as indicating that strange meson exchange is the more important  @xcite .",
    "the picture is even less clear in the @xmath2 case , with theoretical estimates of @xmath25 ranging from 0.25 to 5  @xcite , or around 2  @xcite or 3  @xcite , depending upon the assumptions made .",
    "the situation can only be clarified by further experimental work .",
    "this is reported here in the form of inclusive @xmath0 momentum spectra measured on hydrogen and deuterium targets at four proton beam energies .",

    "such an approach is very successful at the three lower energies but fails badly at 2.65  gev when heavier hyperons and extra pions can be produced . in order to clarify the effects of the kinematics ,",
    "the cross sections were smeared over the fermi motion in the deuteron , though the resultant changes were fairly minor .",
    "taking into account a small shadowing correction , it is seen in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] that @xmath27 production on the neutron is about half of that for @xmath28 on the proton .",
    "however , since half the strength in the @xmath2 case should emerge in the @xmath29 channel , our result is consistent with strangeness production near threshold being of similar size for both isospin @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : anke ] . only information provided by the positive detector ( pd ) , forward detector ( fd ) and a prototype of the silicon tracking telescope ( stt ) was used in the present analysis .",

    "each of them consists of a stop counter , two copper degraders , a counter for measuring the energy loss ( @xmath40 counter ) and one for detecting the @xmath0 decay products ( veto counter ) .",
    "the thickness of the first degrader was chosen such that the kaon deposits maximal energy in the @xmath40 counter and stops either at its edge or in the second degrader .",
    "measurements of the time difference between the @xmath0 in the stop counter and its decay products in the veto counter provide a clear @xmath0 identification even if the background from pions and protons is @xmath41 times higher  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of each range telescope , which was between 10% and 30% depending upon the particular telescope , the parameters of the cuts , and the trigger conditions , were determined from the experimental data .",
    "the overall uncertainty from telescope to telescope arising from this efficiency correction was estimated with an accuracy of @xmath42% for the @xmath43 data and the @xmath1 at @xmath44  gev , and @xmath45% for the other @xmath1 runs .",
    "full details of @xmath0 identification using the anke range telescopes can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the cross section normalizations were established from the information supplied by the fd detector system , as described in ref .",
    "the fd consists of three multiwire chambers and a hodoscope of scintillators . in the hydrogen - target experiments , and for deuterium at @xmath46  gev ,",
    "the first multiwire proportional chamber was replaced by a drift chamber . for the hydrogen experiments ,",
    "a dedicated prescaled trigger was used to monitor the @xmath1 elastic scattering rate throughout the experimental runs .",
    "elastic scattering events were identified in the angular range @xmath47@xmath48 in the forward detector using the missing - mass technique .",
    "the luminosity was then evaluated on the basis of the known @xmath1 differential cross sections with an overall normalization error of 7%  @xcite .",
    "a similar method was employed to normalize the 2.650  gev @xmath43 data .",
    "the prescaled rate for the production of fast protons from proton - deuteron collisions was continuously monitored in the forward detector over the angular range @xmath49@xmath48 . because it was not possible to distinguish between elastic scattering and deuteron break - up events ,",
    "the experimental count rate was converted into luminosity estimates through calculations carried out within the glauber - sitenko theory  @xcite .",
    "the associated overall normalization error should not exceed 15%  @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of signals from the silicon tracking telescope and forward detector was used to measure @xmath43 elastic scattering at @xmath50 and @xmath36  gev .",
    "the stt consists of three silicon detectors placed in ultra - high vacuum , with the first layer being 5  cm from the beam - target interaction point  @xcite .",
    "the identification of the deuteron in the stt , together with a proton in the fd , allows one to select unambiguously elastic @xmath51 events .",
    "however , uncertainties in the evaluation of the acceptance _ etc .",
    "_  means that the overall absolute normalization error was @xmath52% , though the relative error between different beam energies was at most @xmath53%  @xcite .",
    "the double - differential cross section for @xmath0 production in each momentum bin @xmath54 is evaluated from @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of @xmath0 detected in a solid angle @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "the efficiency of @xmath0 identification , @xmath59 , is estimated from @xmath60 the scintillator ( @xmath61 ) and mwpc ( @xmath62 ) efficiencies are determined from the experimental data . the kaon acceptance , including corrections for decay in flight , ( @xmath63 ) is determined using simulations .",
    "the range - telescope efficiency @xmath64 , whose value is extracted from calibration data on @xmath65 coincidences , represents the main systematic uncertainty in the cross section evaluation  @xcite .",
    "the laboratory double - differential cross section for @xmath0 production on hydrogen ( open symbols ) and deuterium ( closed symbols ) are presented at the four different beam energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcr ] as functions of the kaon momentum .",
    "the cross sections represent averages over @xmath0 laboratory production angles up to @xmath66 ; the measured values are also collected in table  [ tab : tddcr ] .    the double - differential cross sections for @xmath0 production in @xmath43 and @xmath1 collisions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcr ] , have rather similar shapes and their ratio depends only weakly on the kaon momentum . because the @xmath43 data at the three lower energies were taken with different values of the _ d2 _ magnetic field from those for @xmath1 , the associated momentum bins are slightly different . in these cases",
    "the ratio of the @xmath0 production cross sections was evaluated by assuming a linear variation from one bin to the next .",
    "however , corrections for the data measured at 2.020  gev are minimal .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the momentum dependence of",
    "the ratio @xmath67 is relatively weak at all four energies .",
    "therefore , for comparison to the model discussed in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we calculate the weighted average of the ratio of the differential cross sections over the @xmath0 momentum range .",
    "the numerical values of the ratio are given in table  [ tab : tratio ] and presented graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : money ] .",
    "the averaging error @xmath68 given in the table takes into account , not only the errors for individual points , but also the momentum dependence of the ratio .",
    "there is very little information on the production of @xmath0 in association with excited hyperons and almost nothing on reactions where an extra pion is produced . as a consequence , we model the data purely in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 final states , though this will clearly be insufficient at the highest energy .",
    "kaon production on a proton is assumed to be the sum of contributions from these three channels . in the estimation of the @xmath6 contribution ,",
    "the phase space was modified by the @xmath71 final state interaction and the @xmath72 resonance , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "simple phase space descriptions were used for the two @xmath73 channels .",
    "the predictions were normalized to the parameterizations of the total cross sections for @xmath6 and @xmath73 production  @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , the total cross section for @xmath74 production was assumed to be a factor @xmath75 smaller than that for @xmath7 at the same excess energy  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 calculations describe reasonably well the experimental @xmath0 momentum spectra at the three lower energies presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcr ] . however , many more channels are open at 2.65  gev and it is not surprising that there is then a discrepancy of up to a factor of three .",
    "data collected on a deuterium target are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcr ] . in this case",
    "the predictions of the three - channel model for @xmath0 production in @xmath1 interaction have been smeared over the fermi momentum , using the deuteron wave function derived from the bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "the glauber shadowing effect , which was discussed in detail for the @xmath76 case , is included by scaling the predictions for the sum of the cross sections on the proton and neutron by a factor of 0.95  @xcite .",
    "any uncertainty in the size of this factor is small compared to the experimental errors .",
    "note that the other effect discussed there , of @xmath77 conversion on the second nucleon , has no parallel for @xmath0 production .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 averaged over the @xmath0 momentum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : money ] for the four beam energies investigated .",
    "it can be seen from the thresholds that are indicated for the production of different strange baryonic states that , unlike for the three lower energies , at 2.65  gev there are far more open channels than we have considered in our model .",
    "the predictions of the model for the ratio of the fermi - smeared @xmath78 plus the @xmath26 total cross sections divided by the free hydrogen data are shown by the curve @xmath79 .",
    "scaling this by a factor of 1.5 gives results that are in reasonable accord with the data .",
    "simulations were also performed for the ratio of differential cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcr ] over the proton beam energy range @xmath80  gev , where the dependence on kaon momentum is quite weak .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : money ] that it makes very little difference in the modeling whether one estimates the ratios of differential or total cross sections .",
    "this gives us confidence to conclude that , despite relatively small acceptance of anke , the observed ratio of differential cross sections allows us to extract information on the difference between @xmath0 production on the proton and neutron .",
    "this is especially true for the lower three energies , where the three - channel model should be effective .",
    "the ratio results presented here clearly indicate that inclusive @xmath0 production on the neutron is less than on the proton at all the four energies investigated .",
    "the best agreement between experimental data and our model is obtained if the ratio of the total cross sections for @xmath0 production in the two targets has a value of @xmath81 which , after taking the shadowing into account , means that the ratio for @xmath0 production in @xmath2 and @xmath1 collisions @xmath82although the ratio seems to depend only weakly upon the beam energy , it should be noted that many different hyperons can be produced at 2.65  gev and this can change the physics significantly .    at low energies",
    ", @xmath6 production dominates the inclusive cross section and extra constraints then follow from isospin invariance .",
    "even if the @xmath31 amplitude in the @xmath83 reaction vanishes , there would still be the contribution from the @xmath30 term , so that@xmath84this inequality is only exact for the total cross sections where there can be no interference between the @xmath31 and @xmath30 waves .",
    "it is not rigorous when there is a cut on the @xmath0 momentum and especially on its angle which could , _ in principle _ , lead to some destructive interference over the acceptance of the anke spectrometer . if this possibility is neglected and only @xmath6 production considered , eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) implies that @xmath85the difference between this and the result of eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) arises from the fact that , for a neutron target , half of the signal would be associated with @xmath3 production .",
    "the isospin ratio is much less than that determined for @xmath77 production , where a value of about twelve has been reported near threshold  @xcite .",
    "it should therefore provide valuable guidance for the modeling of kaon production in nucleon - nucleon collisions as well as for experiments involving nuclear beams and/or targets .",
    "the double - differential cross sections for @xmath0 production have been measured at four different proton beam energies using hydrogen and deuterium targets .",
    "a value of @xmath86 has been extracted for the cross section ratio .",
    "this result is not incompatible with the @xmath87 obtained at 2.1  gev per nucleon , though with the rather complicated naf target  @xcite . in our case the ratio seems to depend weakly upon the proton beam energy and an average value of @xmath88 was extracted from the experimental data using a three - channel model .",
    "taking into account the unobserved @xmath3 production , this shows that strangeness production near threshold is rather similar for the two isospin channels of the initial nucleon - nucleon system .    to reduce the uncertainty in the cross section ratio it would be necessary to measure the spectator proton @xmath89 in the @xmath90 reaction to ensure that the production had taken place on the neutron",
    "this is possible at anke through the use of the silicon tracking telescopes and results will eventually be available on inclusive @xmath0 production in the low energy region  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the detection of all the fast final particles in the @xmath91 reaction would allow the kinematics of spectator proton to be reconstructed  @xcite .",
    "we wish to thank the cosy machine crew and other members of the anke collaboration for their help during the preparation and running of the experiments reported here .",
