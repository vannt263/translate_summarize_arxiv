    "manganese-12 acetate ( mn@xmath1ac ) is a molecular magnet which has been the subject of much study , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , since it was first fabricated by lis in 1980 @xcite .",
    "while most of the research into the properties of mn@xmath0-ac has been focused on its interesting magnetic properties , some work has been done more recently exploring the electronic properties , in particular the conductance through mn@xmath0-ac @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions have also been made concerning the electronic structure of related mn@xmath0 molecules @xcite .",
    "this study seeks to shed light on how the presence of these molecular magnets on the surface of a gold film can affect the transport properties of the conduction electrons within that gold film .    in order to explore the interactions between the mn@xmath0-ac and the gold film",
    ", one must have a theoretical framework for understanding the interactions .",
    "the theory of weak localization @xcite provides such a framework by quantifying the strengths of the various scattering processes experienced by the conduction electrons .",
    "conduction electrons within a metal can undergo elastic scattering , such as surface scattering or scattering from lattice defects ; inelastic scattering , such as electron - phonon scattering ; spin scattering , such as scattering from magnetic impurities ; or spin - orbit scattering .",
    "each of these processes makes specific contributions to the resistance of the film and each changes in a specific way in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "weak localization predicts the change in resistance of a metallic film in a perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath2 , due to weak localization effects to have the following dependence @xcite :    @xmath3\\label{eq : magnetoresistance}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the sheet resistance of the film and @xmath5 are characteristic fields given by    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 being characteristic fields corresponding to elastic , spin - orbit , spin , and inelastic scattering , respectively .",
    "the physical quantity of interest is the scattering time , @xmath13 , associated with each type of scattering process .",
    "the scattering times are related to the scattering fields by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the electron charge and @xmath16 is the diffusion constant in two dimensions .",
    "measurement of the magnetoresistance of a metal , then , allows one to determine the scattering times associated with the various scattering processes which the conduction electrons undergo . by simultaneously measuring the magnetoresistance of gold films with and without mn@xmath0-ac on the surface and computing how the characteristic scattering times change , one can determine the types of interactions taking place between the conduction electrons in the gold and the mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "in order to perform the magnetoresistance measurements , a thin film of au was made by thermal evaporation onto a room temperature silicon substrate with the native oxide layer and a 20@xmath17 ge adhesion layer .",
    "a shadow mask , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : au_pattern ] , was used to define a pattern consisting of a single current - carrying strip with eight voltage probes , four on each side of the strip .",
    "this setup allows a four - wire measurement of two different sections of the strip simultaneously and with some redundancy . by placing mn@xmath0-ac on half of the current carrying strip , the magnetoresistance with and without mn@xmath0-ac can be measured simultaneously using the same excitation current and magnetic field .",
    "theoretical fits are obtained using a least - squares fitting method to obtain the best set of the four fitting parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 .",
    "schematic of pattern used for au samples . ]",
    "mn@xmath0-ac was placed on the surface of the au film using a simple drop - and - dry technique , similar to the established dip - and - dry technique@xcite .",
    "a solution was made by dissolving 10  mg of mn@xmath0-ac powder in 10  ml of isopropyl alcohol .",
    "five drops of this solution were dropped onto half of the au film with ample drying time between drops .",
    "it was observed by afm ( see figure 1 , ref . ) that this is sufficient to ensure good coverage of the au with mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "samples were then mounted in a dilution refrigerator for measurement .",
    "results shown are from typical samples",
    ".    figure  [ fig:7.8nm_600mk ] shows the measured magnetoresistance for a 7.8  nm au film , with and without mn@xmath0-ac , at a temperature of 600  mk . in the dilution refrigerator used in these experiments , 600  mk",
    "was found to be an easy temperature to reach and stabilize , while lower temperature measurements did not seem to provide any substantial advantage .",
    "the solid curves are fits to the theory of weak localization using equation  [ eq : magnetoresistance ] .",
    "the fitting parameters , @xmath18 , used for the fits in figure  [ fig:7.8nm_600mk ] are listed in table  [ tab : characteristic - fields-78 ] .",
    "also listed are the characteristic scattering times calculated using equation  [ eq : h_tau ] .",
    "the elastic scattering time is increased by approximately a factor of two if mn@xmath0 is present .",
    "this indicates a decrease in the amount of elastic scattering , consistent with a change in the surface which reduces the amount of surface scattering .",
    "the inelastic and spin - orbit scattering are essentially unchanged , while the spin scattering time is reduced by around an order of magnitude .",
    "this indicates a significant increase in the amount of spin scattering taking place .",
    "the decrease in elastic scattering and increase in spin scattering are consistent with a picture in which electrons which would have scattered from the surface of the au film are instead entering the mn@xmath0-ac molecules and undergoing spin scattering , most likely from the mn atoms within the molecules .",

    "it has been shown that the presence on mn@xmath0-ac on the surface of a thin au film causes significant changes in the magnetoresistance of the au film .",
    "fitting of the experimental data to the predictions of the theory of weak localization allows characterization of the types of changes taking place .",
    "in particular , there is an enhancement of the spin scattering of the conduction electrons , coupled with a reduction in the elastic scattering .",
    "this is consistent with electrons entering the mn@xmath0-ac and undergoing spin scattering , rather than simply scattering from the surface of the au film .",
    "this is the first time that experimental evidence has been seen indicating that a surface layer of molecular magnets can be used as scattering centers to change the electron transport properties of a metallic film ."
