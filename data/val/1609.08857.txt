    "future nanotechnology will use molecular devices executing various manipulations with nano - size objects , such as colloidal particles , vesicles , macromolecules , viruses , small bacteria , cell organelles , etc .",
    "such objects , however , can not stay at rest on their own due to heat , manifesting itself in a form of thermal fluctuations . to execute highly precise manipulations with these objects",
    "one needs to keep them immobilized .",
    "therefore , the devices that can clench and unclench nano - size objects under an external control will be massively demanded . these devices , which can be termed as `` nano - vices '' or `` nano - nippers '' should be able to operate in solutions , including aqueous solutions , where manipulations with biological nano - size objects are expected .",
    "recently , nano - tube nano - tweezers operated by an electric field , that can clench a nano - size object , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "such devices , however , can not work effectively in aqueous solutions ; moreover , the range of forces , as well as the range of operating distances , is relatively narrow for such devices  @xcite .",
    "optical tweezers require specific optical properties of an immobilized object which also restricts their applications  @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable to consider polyelectrolyte - based nano - vices , operated by an electric field , which could be a very promising alternative to existing nano - tube nano - tweezers and optical tweezers .",
    "these can operate in aqueous solutions and demonstrate a wide range of operating forces and distances .",
    "they also overcome limitations imposed by the optical properties of nano - objects  @xcite .    in very simple terms the nano - vices may be comprised of a few charged polymer chains the so - called polyelectrolytes ( pe ) that are linked to two surfaces and exposed to an electric field that serves as a control signal .",
    "varying the field one can alter the length of the non - adsorbed part of the chains and hence the distance between the planes , see fig.1 . in this way one can clench and unclench a nano - size object ( target body ) placed between the planes .",
    "recent technological achievements , e.g. the production of nano - sheets  @xcite enables a practical realization of such devices , hence it is very important to develop a theory of the respective devices and quantitatively describe the basic physical processes there . hence one needs to ( i ) develop a theory of a conformational response of a pe , with one end linked ( grafted ) to a charged surface and the other one to a deformable target body , to a varying electric field and ( ii ) quantify the ability of nano - vices to clench a nano - size object .",
    "the response of pes to external electric fields has been extensively studied the last few decades  @xcite , including the adsorption of pes on oppositely charged surfaces of different geometries  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the conformational response of a pe in an electric field , under an action of a constant force , has been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of nano - vices , however , this problem has been addressed only recently  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quantification of the clenching ability of pe - based nano - vices has not been studied yet . in ref .",
    "@xcite a theory of the phenomenon , based on a model `` physical '' approach has been developed for the case of a constant force acting on a free ( non - grafted ) end of a pe .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalization of this theory for the case of force depending on deformation has been reported . in ref .",
    "@xcite a first - principle theory of this phenomenon has been elaborated ; all the theoretical studies were accompanied by extensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we first discuss the theoretical approach of  @xcite and give a shorter and more straightforward derivation of the main result of the first - principle theory  @xcite .",
    "then we analyse the efficacy of nano - vices calculating the self - diffusion coefficient of a clenched particle . in particular , we show that for rather weak electric fields the pe - based nano - vices can effectively immobilize a clenched brownian particle , reducing its self - diffusion coefficient by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "we consider a system comprised of a chain of @xmath0 monomers , which is anchored to a planar surface at @xmath1 .",
    "the anchoring end - monomer is uncharged .",
    "each of the remaining @xmath2 beads carries the charge @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the elementary charge ) and @xmath2 counterions of charge @xmath5 make the system neutral . for simplicity",
    "we consider a salt - free solution .",
    "however it may be shown @xcite that for intermediate and strong electric fields , the presence of salt ions ( up to physiological concentrations ) leads to a simple renormalization of the external field , so that the qualitative nature of the phenomenon remains unchanged  .",
    "hence a salt - free case , which allows an analytical treatment , is generic .",
    "we use the freely joint chain model with the length of the inter - monomer link equal to @xmath6 .",
    "the md simulations  @xcite justify the application of this model to the analysed phenomena .",
    "we consider a salt - free system , so that no other microions present in the solution , which has the dielectric permittivity @xmath7 . the chain is grafted ( linked ) to a charged plane so that the external electric field @xmath8 acts perpendicular to the plane , favoring the chain adsorption .",
    "the free end of the pe is linked to a deformable body , modeled by a spring , fig.1(b ) .",
    "the deformation energy of the spring @xmath9 depends on the deformation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the sizes of an undeformed and deformed target body respectively .",
    "the restoring force acting on the free end of the chain then reads , @xmath13 in refs .",
    "@xcite the following dependencies have been studied in detail theoretically and numerically : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which refer accordingly to the constant force , linear , non - linear and hertzian spring . here",
    "@xmath18 is the elastic constant of the spring and @xmath19 is the heaviside step function .    for the values of the external field and system parameters addressed in the present study ,",
    "the counterions are practically decoupled from the chain , being accumulated near the upper plane , see fig.1(c ) .",
    "hence the interaction of the chain with the external field as well as interactions between the chain monomers are not screened by the counterions . to find the conformational response of the pe to the external electric field and the force arising in the target body",
    ", one needs to find the free energy of the system and minimize it with respect to relevant parameters .",
    "we first calculate a conditional free energy of the chain @xmath20 with the following conditions imposed : ( i ) @xmath21 monomers of the chain are desorbed and @xmath22 are adsorbed on the charged plane ; ( ii ) the distance between the free chain end , linked to the target body , and the grafting plane is @xmath23 and ( iii ) the end - to - end distance of the adsorbed part of the chain is @xmath24 .",
    "minimizing the conditional free energy @xmath25 with respect to these variables one can find the equilibrium values of @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; using these quantities we then compute the force acting on the target body .    for the freely joint model the location of all monomers of the chain",
    "are determined by @xmath2 vectors @xmath26 , which join centers of @xmath27-st and @xmath28-th monomer ; each of these vectors has the same length @xmath6 .",
    "we enumerate the monomers starting from the free end linked to the target body .",
    "then the beads with numbers @xmath29 refer to the bulk part of the chain , while with numbers @xmath30 to the surface part .",
    "the @xmath0st neutral bead , located at the origin , @xmath31 , is anchored to the surface .",
    "we assume that the adsorbed part of the chain forms a flat structure , so that the centers of the adsorbed beads lie at the plane @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , we ignore the off - surface loops of this part of the chain .",
    "then the location of the @xmath32th bead of the chain and the distance between centers of @xmath28th and @xmath33th bead read , @xmath34 the orientation of each vector @xmath35 is characterized by the polar @xmath36 and azimuthal @xmath37 angles , where the axis @xmath38 is directed perpendicular to the grafting plane , see fig.1(c ) .",
    "therefore the distance between the grafting plane at @xmath1 and the @xmath32th bead of the bulk part of the chain as well as the hight of the top bead for @xmath39 read : @xmath34 @xmath40 the location of the top bead , linked to the target body determines the deformation energy of the target body and the according force which acts on the chain : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coordinate of the top bead for the case when the target body is not deformed . since the chain is not screened by the counterions , the potential associated with the external field @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "hence the interaction energy of the bulk part of the chain with the external potential reads ,    @xmath45    the interaction energy with the external field of the adsorbed part of the chain , located at @xmath1 , is equal to a constant which we take equal to zero .    the electrostatic interactions between the chain monomers are also unscreened and may be written using the fourier transform of a coulomb potential @xmath46 as  @xcite @xmath47 where we exploit eq .",
    "( [ eq : rij ] ) . taking into account that the end - to - end vector of the adsorbed part of the chain has the form @xmath48 ,",
    "we can finally write the conditional free energy as @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being respectively the boltzmann constant and temperature and @xmath53 is the conditional partition function : @xmath54 @xmath55 where the factor @xmath56 keeps @xmath53 dimensionless and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the azimuthal and polar angles of an inter - monomer vector @xmath59 ( see fig.1(c ) ) . we also take into account that @xmath60 , since the adsorbed part of the chain forms a flat structure .",
    "note that @xmath24 is a two - dimensional vector on the plane and the vectors @xmath59 , for @xmath61 have zero @xmath62-component .",
    "using the integral representation for the delta function , @xmath63 where the vector @xmath64 has a lateral and @xmath62 components , @xmath65 , we recast eq .",
    "( [ eq : zch ] ) into the form @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and we define @xmath69 @xmath70^{n_s}. \\nonumber\\ ] ] here we take into account that @xmath71 , that @xmath22 , and use the integral representation of the zeroth - order bessel function , @xmath72 .",
    "we also define the averaging over the azimuthal angles @xmath37 as @xmath73 taking into account the long - range nature of the coulomb interactions in @xmath74 , one can expect that the mean - field approximation will have a good accuracy .",
    "the mean - field approximation deals with the average quantities and neglects fluctuations .",
    "the average quantities are described by the first - order cumulants , while fluctuations by the higher order cumulants .",
    "hence we adopt the following mean - field approximation : @xmath75 performing integrations over @xmath76 and then over @xmath77 , we arrive at ( see e.g. @xcite for detail , where similar quantities have been computed ) :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the bjerrum length , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "next , integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zch1 ] ) over @xmath82 yields , @xmath83 where we use @xmath84 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zpsi ] ) together with the approximation @xmath85 \\approx \\exp [ \\log ( 1-p_{\\perp}^2b^2/4 ) ] \\approx \\exp   ( -p_{\\perp}^2b^2/4)$ ] , which is justified for the range of @xmath86 , that contribute to the integral .",
    "we also use the steepest descent method , justified for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , to evaluate the integral with the saddle point at @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we integrate over @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zch1 ] ) , applying the mean - field approximation , @xmath91 ; this eventually leads to the following expression for the conditional free energy : @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the saddle point .",
    "we also define @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath97 being the exponential integral function , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 and    @xmath100   \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath101    where @xmath102 .",
    "the impact of counterions on the conformation of the bulk part of the chain may be estimated as a weak perturbation . referring for the computational detail to ref .",
    "@xcite we give here the final result : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the gouy - chapman length based on the apparent surface charge density @xmath105 associated with the counterions and @xmath106 is the lateral area of the system .",
    "now we can determine the dependence on the electric field of the pe dimensions as well as the deformation of target body .",
    "simultaneously one obtains the dependence on applied field of the force that arises between chain and the target body .",
    "this may be done minimizing the total free energy of the system @xmath107 with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath108 and using @xmath22 and the constraint @xmath109 .",
    "this allows to find @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath108 as functions of the applied electric field , that is , to obtain @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "then one can compute the force acting onto the target body .",
    "it reads , @xmath113 where @xmath114 , with @xmath115 being the reduced force for a particular force - deformation relation . in the above equation we exploit @xmath116 and the saddle point equation , @xmath117 , valid for @xmath118",
    "to quantify the efficiency of clenching by nano - vices we analyse self - diffusion of a particle squeezed by the planes of the device .",
    "one can say that the body is effectively kept at rest if the self - diffusion coefficient of the clenched particle drops down by a few orders of magnitude , as compared to this value of a free particle .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that both planes are kept parallel and that two equal , normal to the plane , forces act on the top and bottom of the particle .",
    "we neglect twisting and rolling motion of the clenched particle and consider only sliding , that is , the tangential motion .",
    "when the particle moves tangentially , it experiences the following set of forces : ( i ) a viscous force from the surrounding fluid , @xmath119 , that acts against the velocity @xmath120 with the friction coefficient @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath123 is the radius of the particle .",
    "( ii ) a random force from the surrounding fluid @xmath124 , related to the viscous friction .",
    "we assume that this is a @xmath125- correlated force , that obeys the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath126 ( iii ) a `` solid friction '' force between the planes and the particle @xmath127 .",
    "hence one can write the stochastic equation of motion for the brownian particle between the planes : @xmath128    the microscopic derivation of the force @xmath127 is rather challenging , therefore we exploit here the coulomb friction model in the microscopic interpretation of cundall and struck  @xcite .",
    "note that this model has been used for the tangential friction between colloidal particles  @xcite . in the cundall - struck model it is assumed that the solid friction force , that counteracts an externally applied force is equal to a harmonic spring force @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the initial position of a body , before the external force started to act .",
    "after the displacement from the initial position reaches some quantity @xmath132 , the springs breaks down and the body remains displaced by @xmath133 in the direction of the acting force . for the next action of the external force the new initial position @xmath131 corresponds to the shifted one . the maximal force in this model is @xmath134 , while the average force is equal to @xmath135 . on the macroscopic scale @xmath136",
    "the body moves smoothly with the average resistance force equal to @xmath137 , which yields , @xmath138 .",
    "one can also write the solid friction force , in the regime of acting spring as the derivative of the according potential , @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "since the solid friction force always acts against the applied force , we can write the above eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) as the one - dimensional equation in the direction of the applied stochastic force @xmath141 . moreover , if we assume that the viscous force is large , @xmath142 , we recast the above langevin equation into the overdamped form : @xmath143 with @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the diffusion coefficient of a non - constrained particle .",
    "note , that in contrast to conventional overdamped langevin equation , the above eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang_over ] ) describes the potential @xmath146 , centered after each jerk of size @xmath132 , at a new position .",
    "hence the random tangential motion of a particle occurs as following : if a displacement of the particle due to the action of the stochastic force @xmath147 does not exceed @xmath132 , the particle performs a brownian motion in the harmonic potential @xmath146 , centered at @xmath131 , with zero self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "if at some moment @xmath148 the displacement becomes equal to @xmath149 , the particle shifts to @xmath150 and starts to perform brownian motion in the potential @xmath146 , centered at @xmath150 .",
    "let the critical displacements by vectors @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , occur at times @xmath148 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "due to the markovian properties of the random force @xmath147 all the vectors @xmath153 and the instances @xmath155 are independent .",
    "moreover , we can assume that the sequence of times @xmath154 , @xmath155 obeys the poisson distribution @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the average time between the successive jerks .",
    "then the mean square displacement during time @xmath158 reads , @xmath159 which implies that the diffusion coefficient is @xmath160 . in the above equation",
    "we take into account that @xmath161 , due to independence of the displacements @xmath162 and @xmath163 for @xmath164 .    hence , to find the diffusion coefficient one needs to compute the average waiting time @xmath157 .",
    "this may be done if we find the so - called `` mean - first - passage time '' for the potential @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the equation for the average time @xmath165 , needed for a particle , initially located at a point @xmath166 , within a potential well @xmath146 , to reach the point @xmath167 , where the jerk takes place , reads @xcite : @xmath168 where @xmath169 , with @xmath170 and we choose @xmath171 .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath167 are obvious .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfpt ] ) may be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath172 : @xmath173.\\ ] ] now we average @xmath165 over the starting point @xmath166 , using the equilibrium distribution of starting points within the potential well , @xmath174 .",
    "the results then read , @xmath175 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath176 is the normalization constant and in the last expression we expand @xmath177 around @xmath178 and keep only the leading term . if the potential well is deep enough , that is , @xmath179 , then the above expression may approximated by its asymptotic value for @xmath180 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath181 for @xmath182 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : msd ] ) we find the effective self - diffusion coefficient : @xmath183 here @xmath184 depends on the field @xmath43 since @xmath185 , that has been computed in the previous section . using the value of @xmath186 , which is motivated by the friction coefficients between polymer surfaces ( e.g. @xmath187 for polystyrene - polystyrene , @xmath188 for nylon - nylon , etc . ) , and taking into account that the friction force acts on the top and bottom part of a clenched particle , which duplicates the friction force , we calculate @xmath184 as a function of the electric field . the results for @xmath189 are shown in fig.3(b ) . for simplicity in our calculation",
    "we use @xmath190 for the microscopic parameter of the cundall - struck friction model .",
    "the md simulations have been performed for a freely joint bead - spring chain .",

    "@xmath192 monovalent free counterions of opposite charge make the system electroneutral .",
    "we assume the implicit good solvent which implies short - ranged , purely repulsive interaction between all particles , described by a shifted lennard - jones potential .",
    "neighboring beads along the chain are connected by the standard fene potential , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the bond length at zero force is @xmath193 with @xmath194 being the lennard - jones parameter .",
    "all particles except the anchor bead interact with a short - ranged repulsive potential with the grafting plane at @xmath1 and upper plane at @xmath195 .",
    "the charged particles interact with each other and the external field with unscreened coulomb potential , quantified by the bjerrum length .",
    "we set @xmath196 and use a langevin thermostat to hold the temperature @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the lennard - jones energy parameter .",
    "more simulation details are given in refs .",
    "the free end of the chain is linked to a deformable target body , which is modeled by springs with various force - deformation relations .",
    "we use the hertzian force , which can describe the `` core '' interactions between nano - particles  @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the anchor of a spring is fixed and aligned in the direction of the applied field .",
    "the footprint of the simulation box is @xmath199 ( in units of @xmath200 ) and the box height is @xmath201 .",
    "a typical simulation snapshot is shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "we observed that already for relatively weak fields , starting from the field of about @xmath202 and higher fields , the adsorbed part of the chain is almost flat , while the bulk part of the pe chain in strongly stretched along the field .",
    "moreover , in sharp contrast to the field - free case  @xcite the countertions are decoupled from the pe and accumulate near the upper plane .",
    "in fig.3(a ) we show the results of md simulations and compare them to the theoretical predictions . in particular ,",
    "the dependence of the field - induced force , acting on the target body is shown as the function of the external electric field . as it may be seen from the figure a very good agreement between the theory and md data",
    "is observed in the absence of any fitting parameters .",
    "note however , that the theory has been developed for a highly charged chain with a relatively strong self - interactions and interactions with the charged plane .",
    "some systematic deviations are observed for large fields for the largest nano - particle .",
    "this may be probably attributed to a possible elongation of the bond length for strong forces , which is not accounted in the freely joint chain model with the fixed bond length @xmath6 .",
    "note that for aqueous solutions at the ambient conditions , the characteristic units of the force and field are @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively ; the latter value is about an order of magnitude smaller than the critical breakdown field for water .",
    "also note that the range of electric fields roughly corresponds to a surface charge density of @xmath205 , typical for charged graphite surfaces  @xcite .    in fig.3(b )",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the clenched particle on the external field is shown .",
    "one can see a dramatic decrease of @xmath184 even for relatively weak fields .",
    "the effect becomes even more pronounced for larger particles , where the characteristic field of @xmath206 reduces the diffusion coefficient by nine orders of magnitude .",
