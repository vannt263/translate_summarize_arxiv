    "the fifth dimension has been discussed in the scientific literature for seventy years or more . historically , the preponderance of attempts to use five dimensions  @xcite combine a gravitational theory similar to einstein s  @xcite with an electromagnetic theory similar to maxwell s  @xcite .",
    "the earliest versions were modeled after the general theory of relativity  @xcite , while later attempts to combine other interactions  @xcite are considerablely more intricate .",
    "the integration of quantum ideas into theories has been frustrating and inconclusive .",
    "quantum mechanics is usually appended by attaching a hilbert space to each region of space - time .",
    "it is suggested here that there is a wholly geometrical a way to describe physical phenomena , including quantum mechanics .",
    "the historical exclusion of quantum mechanics from fundamental classical theories is deemed arbitrary .",
    "it is proposed that the essential elements of quantum mechanics reside within natural geometrical structures  @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics becomes an inherent , inseparable part of the mathematics .",
    "the basis of classical unified field theories rests on the work of h. weyl @xcite and t. kaluza @xcite .",
    "the association of these ideas with quantum mechanics has been know for some time .",
    "following earlier studies for the weyl theories  @xcite , it has become possible to develop a five dimensional geometrical quantum theory .",
    "several particular assumptions need to be discussed . by stating unusual starting points , it is hoped to save the reader the difficulty of inferring them from the conclusions .    much of the einsteinian viewpoint is adopted .",
    "microscopic trajectories are hypothesized as a universal description of the effects of quantum mechanics , electromagnetism and general relativity .",
    "while the success of this approach for quantum theory is not yet established , it allows the direct discussion of gravitational phenomena . in accord with the goal of a wholly geometrical theory ,",
    "the mathematics is hard deterministic and time symmetric .",
    "quantum probabilities must be associated with a congruence of statistically populated trajectories . because of the metaphysical conflicts between quantum theory and relativity , certain concepts must be refashioned to allow the synthesis .",
    "the vector potential plays a more prominent role .",
    "metrics in higher dimensions have modified interpretations .",
    "the hilbert space becomes a calculational artifact and not a starting point .",
    "electrodynamics is assumed time symmetric , along the lines of the classical articles by feynman and wheeler  @xcite . for geodetic motion that includes electromagnetic effects",
    ", the force of radiative reaction must be due to fields derived from other particles .",
    "there can be no force of radiation until the interacting ( absorbing ) particles are included in the field sources . for a quantum gravitational theory , this time",
    "symmetric construction must be supposed to exist at a metaphysical level that is deeper than the macroscopic structure of maxwell .",
    "electrodynamics is assumed to derive from a primitive classical truth of geometry , comparable with general relativity . in a microscopically deterministic theory , the question of the separation of causal agents from their effects becomes problematical .",
    "this does not appear to contradict the experimental situation .",
    "a precise definition of causality probably can not have a microscopic formulation in a theory that is hard deterministic , time symmetric and quantum mechanical . without a primitive assumption",
    ", it is supposed that time asymmetry and the associated causality follow from macroscopic effects that may depend on other conditions in the universe .",
    "these conditions may include statistical mechanics , cosmology , psychology or the real physical effects of other interactions  @xcite .",
    "microscopic time asymmetry is not eliminated in principle but does not contribute to the discussion .",
    "the geometrical concept of a congruence is associated with the quantum mechanical state function of a particle .",
    "wave particle duality is not considered essential .",
    "since emission and absorption is the only known evidence for photons , they are assumed to be calculational artifacts that derive from charged particle quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "finite mass particles , having time like trajectories , are the only true particles .",
    "interactions are mediated by fields .",
    "any discreteness in the fields ( photons or gravitons ) derives from the discreteness of the source particles  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the fields have no dynamical qualities except that which is implied by the sources .",
    "fundamental free fields are rejected .    to describe more that one particle , the mathematical field structure must be augmented .",
    "gravity is conventionally approximated by a single metric tensor that specifies the global distortion of space - time .",
    "in such an approximation , a collection of particles @xmath0 moves in a space - time specified by a metric that is a solution of a set of gravitational field equations .",
    "this single metric is insufficient when constructing a combined theory of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics .",
    "the structures are not analogous .",
    "these latter effects are described by fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one each for each particle .",
    "of course the approximation of a universal metric for a collection of simple particles is usually valid , particularly in the laboratory .",
    "however when quantum mechanics and electrodynamics are integrated with gravity , an analogous collection of metrics @xmath3 is required .",
    "these metrics can be treated as equal under many experimental situations ; but in principle , even microscopic gravitational interactions are present and provide interparticle forces .",
    "consequently each particle must have a formal wave function , vector potential and metrical tensor , @xmath4 .",
    "an extended principle of equivalence is made possible since the motion of each particle can be the result of different combinations of assigned fields .",
    "a special metric @xmath5 , identified with the observer of general relativity , is maintained separately from the individual metrics of the particles .",
    "it represents the structure of space - time as measured with neutral particles and the idealized null trajectories of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "multiple metrics have been used at least since dirac  @xcite and are implied by the conformal invariance of weyl  @xcite .",
    "other multiple metric theories of gravitation are listed by ni  @xcite .",
    "a classical observer does not perceive quantum mechanics or electromagnetic fields to be part of space - time geometry .",
    "if these effects are to be intrinsic , a separate phenomenology of charged and neutral particles must be defined .",
    "hypothetical mirrors are assumed to be neutral objects to the observer .",
    "forces of radiative reaction on a mirror are neglected or compensated during gravitational space - time measurements and the individual charged particles which make up the mirror are treated collectively .",
    "the observer s metric @xmath5 is used to describe the perceived pattern of the collective motion of many particles . as a mathematical object ,",
    "it retains multiparticle phenomenology and can not be measured by using a single particle wave function or quantum state .",
    "observations depend on idealized measurements of composite particles and clocks that traverse each point with different velocities  @xcite .",
    "each such independent direction requires at least one wave function  @xcite .",
    "four dimensional space - time , must be derived in this way from a larger geometry as a limit or approximation .",
    "stable , massive , neutral , primitive ( non - composite ) particles are required .",
    "since there are none known , the phenomenological metric may not have a basis in the motion of elementary particles but may only have a well defined meaning as a description of collective motion .",
    "an increase in dimensionality always leads to new quantities and interpretations .",
    "it is supposed that each particle , no matter how it might be described ultimately , projects onto a time like trajectory in the observer s space - time .",
    "thus , the directly observed dimensionality is always three plus one .",
    "the effects of new coordinates must be inferred .",
    "a similar problem occurs in the transition to four dimensions . starting with three space dimensions",
    ", the metric assigns positions and distances to palpable objects .",
    "the pythagorean theorem can be verified ( or falsified ) by direct measurement .",
    "relativity demonstrates this space to be incomplete .",
    "it must be extended to include time . in doing this ,",
    "the developed procedure of using light beams to find the components of the four metric , is not even qualitatively equivalent to the use of a simple ruler . in space - time",
    ", the experimental determination of geodesics is completely different .",
    "presumably , any further extension beyond four dimensions will involve crucial conceptual modifications . by analogy",
    ", one would expect five dimensional measurements to be even less pythagorean than four dimensional measurements .",
    "modifications in the metrical interpretation mitigate the need for cylindricity or dynamical compactification .",
    "instead , the use of null five - vectors is sufficient .",
    "arbitrary non - null five vectors can be constructed but they are not used here to represent physical quantities .",
    "as the geodesics of light are null in four - space , the geodesics of particles are null in five - space .",
    "this seems to be important for the relationship between weyl and kaluza - klein theories as well as for the proper inclusion of quantum effects .",
    "if the velocity vector is null , then the motion can be represented by four parameters alone .",
    "the essential vector length variations of weyl theory are incompatible with a riemannian theory unless the vectors map into null riemannian vectors .",
    "a fractional change in a weyl vector can be mapped onto a null vector because a fraction change in a null riemannian vector is permitted . in this way",
    ", transformations within the riemannian system can be related to apparent conformal effects .",
    "a non - null extension may be possible but such vectors can not be related to a weyl theory . a rigid metrical five dimensional structure that is analogous to our perception of three - space is assumed in many other theories .",
    "these , even when followed by the application of spontaneous compactification will not allow for the implicit inclusion of quantum mechanics .",
    "because of the physics of geometrization , the construction of lagrangians has not been found useful .",
    "the physical quantities that have reasonable covariance properties are often null or unavailable and the usual suppositions lead to quantities which are identically zero .",
    "lagrangian mechanics was originally motivated by the need to extend calculations to situations involving constraints , such as rigid bodies or contact forces .",
    "this motivation is unjustified in relativistic theories since rigid bodies do not exist and contact elasticities are finite .",
    "furthermore , the origin of these contact constraints is directly from the quantum mechanics of collectively interacting particles .",
    "this questions the epistemological assignment of lagrangians as a basis for quantum mechanics .",
    "there is no apriori reason to believe that theories developed to describe constraints , should provide a basis for microphysics .",
    "the convenience of choosing interaction terms in a lagrangian increases descriptive strength but reduces predictive power .",
    "it has been found necessary and advantageous to choose differential equations without recourse to any construction of classical mechanics .",
    "a few less controversial questions may be worth mentioning . a full discussion of second quantization is not made here .",
    "such a formalism would represent the description of more than one particle , possibly including particle creation and annihilation .",
    "these complexities will have to be deferred until the one particle system is better understood . at present",
    ", only a partial version of a geometrically appropriate quantum electrodynamics is available .",
    "a complete systematic discussion is needed .",
    "spin , weak and strong interactions are also deferred .",
    "an understanding of elementary quantum methods is deemed a necessary prerequisite .",
    "a number of other constructions found in the literature have not been incorporated .",
    "magnetic monopoles are not used .",
    "five dimensional monopole solutions are supposed nonphysical and may be mathematical ghosts  @xcite .",
    "strings  @xcite may show similarities but do no follow the formalism .",
    "there are no discrete lattices .",
    "solitons are not used .",
    "space - time is not treated stochastically  @xcite .",
    "there is no torsion  @xcite .",
    "there is no topological compactification , dynamical or otherwise  @xcite .",
    "because of the difficulty of precisely defining the difference between quantum and non - quantum theories , classical mechanics is intended to refer to the limit , as @xmath6 and not to any fundamental classical theory .",
    "these particular assumptions should provide a usable basic starting point .",
    "surely reality is more complicated .",
    "it is useful to associate the fifth dimension of a five dimensional riemannian space with the proper time .",
    "let the defining equation for @xmath7 be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 the einstein summation is in effect .",
    "lower case greek indices are summed over four values and lower case latin indices are summed over five .",
    "equation  ( [ fdpte ] ) is intended to apply to the standard observer of four dimensional space - time .",
    "it is proposed that nullity of five displacements is maintained for primitive particles even when off diagonal terms are appended .",
    "a neutral particle has a fifth coordinate defined by the path integral of @xmath11 the space - time coordinates define @xmath12 , up to an additive constant .",
    "further constructions will indicate that electromagnetic or quantum effects occur when @xmath13 .",
    "it is supposed that the nullity of displacements for charged neutral particles is maintained in the presence of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the particle intrinsic fifth coordinate will not necessarily be the same as the neutral space proper time . in this case , an inferred physical comparison of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , can determine a physical value for the new terms @xmath16 . in the neutral case @xmath17",
    "is not well defined and is arbitrarily set to -1 .",
    "time like displacements are represented by real proper time values in conventional units .    for classical relativity ,",
    "the accumulation of differences in the proper time along distinct trajectories is second order .",
    "no cross terms , @xmath18 , occur .",
    "the twins of the twin paradox are neutral objects and experience second order age corrections .",
    "the direct observation of first order terms , which are only assigned to primitive particles , is not possible because a real physical clock can not be attached to the five space trajectory .",
    "the usual principle of equivalence is intended , historically , for uncharged classical particles in a four dimensional theory  @xcite .",
    "when attempting to extend this , the existence of particles with different charge to mass ratios causes an essential difficulty .",
    "even more , quantum diffraction depends inversely on the mass and destroys compositional additivity .",
    "a principle of equivalence must therefore be constructed for a single isolated particle characterized by particular charge and mass value .",
    "particles having different interactions , ( electromagnetic or quantum ) must use tensors of different internal construction .",
    "the particle properties are incorporated into the fields that determine the local particle rest frame .",
    "the mass must enter with a factor @xmath19 . as will be shown in a paper to follow ,",
    "this factor is a scale size of the fifth dimension much as the speed of light is the scale size of the fourth dimension .",
    "this construction presumes that the mass ratios of fundamental particles are ultimately derivable geometrical quantities .",
    "factors of @xmath19 are taken to appear in combination with all masses .",
    "this factor also appears in the fine structure constant because the quantum manifestation of the inertial force is a standard quantity against which the electric forces are measured .",
    "the geometrical extension can be motivated by physical argument .",
    "consider a gedanken experiment performed on two idealized particles .",
    "each of these should be isolated , non - composite , stable , and of finite mass .",
    "the first one , denoted by @xmath20 is neutral and does not respond to electromagnetic fields .",
    "the second , denoted by @xmath21 is charged .",
    "it responds in the classical limit according to the lorentz force law .",
    "following figure  ( [ f1 ] ) , the two particles begin on the left with coincident motion .",
    "a single rest frame making both particles equivalent can be obtained .",
    "the particles separate as they traverse a region where the electromagnetic field tensor is nonzero . the field in this region",
    "can be adjusted so that after exiting , both particles converge to intersect at space - time point @xmath22 with distinct velocities @xmath23 . at @xmath22 ,",
    "the particles can not be made equivalent even though they were equivalent at @xmath24 .",
    "the usual sense of the equivalence principle dictates that it should be possible to perform continuous coordinate transformations to find an invariant local rest frame for either particle . within general relativity",
    ", there is no way to do this .    to resolve the paradox , additional geometrical quantities can be used to describe velocities that may have electromagnetic ( or quantum ) origin . either a four dimensional non - riemannian weyl geometry or a five dimensional riemannian geometry is possible .",
    "these supply additional electromagnetic - geometrical transformations which describe the motion of charged particles without affecting the motion of idealized neutral objects . in this way , a principle of equivalence can be used .",
    "the nullity of the displacement vector , as applied to an individual particle is related to the concept of a killing vector .",
    "it will be seen that the equivalence of the trajectories under displacements is related to the equivalence of the different forces that might cause a deflection .",
    "different parts of the trajectory can not be equivalent as viewed by the neutral observer because the acceleration appears to have different causative explanations .",
    "that is , the effective field and source currents vary along the congruence .",
    "several studies have been made of the intrinsic relationship of the aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite with five dimensional theories  @xcite .",
    "as a realizable example , applied to this gedanken experiment , it is particularly interesting since neither the neutral nor the charged particle actually enters the region where the field tensor is non - zero .",
    "there is however a difference in deflection which is experimentally observable and can not be described by the conventional principle of equivalence in space - time .",
    "the metric tensor , @xmath15 , and electromagnetic vector potential , @xmath25 , have known classical geometrical interpretations .",
    "it is desirable to adjoin a wave function without a first quantization process . as a first step ,",
    "the classical equations must be rewritten in a fixed gauge form  @xcite .",
    "the usual gauge freedom is assumed non - fundamental and is transformed to a fixed value specified by making the action identically zero .",
    "( any analogous wave function will have its phase removed . )",
    "the standard classical five metric , having signature @xmath26 is appropriate and can be written in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "it is sufficient to show that a velocity defined by @xmath29 defines a classical null geodesic .",
    "the absolute derivative of the above is @xmath30 } \\ ] ] wherein the christoffel symbols are calculated with respect to the neutral space four metric @xmath5 this can be converted into the conventional form since the hamilton - jacobi equation with fixed gauges is @xmath31 .",
    "the covariant derivative of this equation can be used to eliminate the second christoffel symbol which gives @xmath32 here , the path parameter @xmath33 is normalized relative to the neutral space four metric .",
    "direct derivations from the five metric are given in references  @xcite , either by the lagrangian method or by parallel transport .",
    "these agree with the above fixed gauge calculation and give the the combined force law .",
    "this establishes that the fixed gauge equation of motion  ( [ nfxf ] ) is a valid construction in the presence of gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "this description defines a congruence of motion which is the set of integral curves of a fixed gauge vector potential field .",
    "such an individual congruence , which is a general solution of the hamilton - jacobi system , can be developed into a quantum state .",
    "selection of a whole congruence need not specify a particular trajectory as the unique trajectory of a particle . to completely specify such a quantum state , a quantum field equation is required . for a scalar field ,",
    "the klein - gordon equation is used .",
    "such a quantum solution , when written in a fixed gauge representation can not in general have a normalized vector potential as in the classical representation .",
    "the magnitude @xmath34 is not constant .",
    "this is true even though the unnormalized vector potential still satisfies the inhomogeneous maxwell equations . to make the system amenable to quantization",
    ", it is assumed at this point that the unnormalized vector potential is still suitable as a purveyor of the physical quantity within the geometrical system .",
    "this identification can be applied to both the weyl and kaluza theories .",
    "the resulting congruence contains , under reasonable conditions and with reasonable physical assumptions , the information that was contained in the original wave function .",
    "any phase information has been incorporated directly into @xmath35 , only the magnitude of @xmath36 need be regenerated .",
    "this can often be done , in practical cases from the current conservation alone .",
    "global reconstruction may require recourse to the field equation and boundary conditions .",
    "the essential idea is that such a congruence is sufficient to represent the essential part of a single particle quantum state function .",
    "the local structure of the five dimensional coordinate system is larger than the the four dimensional lorentz group .",
    "the additional transformations are necessary for the principle of equivalence discussed in section  [ ecq ] .",
    "an interpretation can be developed by applying the new transformations as local point operations on a charged particle .",
    "a related problem is mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "the usual transformations involving the observer s coordinates @xmath37 still apply and affect the vector potential covariantly .",
    "the transformations involving @xmath12 are new , and because of the fixed gauge assumption , have specific physical effects and interpretations .",
    "they are affine and orthogonality is not maintained .",
    "the most useful of these is @xmath38 and changes the four - velocity of the charged particle according to @xmath39 the electromagnetic vector potential is thereby identified with a shear transformation . if the arbitrary path increment @xmath40 is selected equal to the apparent proper time change , @xmath41 , the transformation  ( [ alct ] ) gives a new velocity for the particle .",
    "such transformations represent a realignment of the five dimensional space .",
    "it is used to describe velocity changes that are of quantum or electromagnetic origin as distinguished from those that are gravitational .    using @xmath42 for the kinetic momentum",
    ", @xmath43 identifies the quantum nature of the transformation because of the similarity with the minimal substitution .",
    "this assumption identifies the motion as a first order quantity relative to the neutral system .",
    "a lorentz transformation , as a contact transformation in space - time , changes the velocity of the particle and also the value of @xmath44 .",
    "the new value represents the instantaneous particle motion and also the local effective transformed orientation of the five dimensional space .",
    "the electromagnetic effects are not modeled by lorentz group elements but by the new aspects of the five dimensional coordinate system .",
    "the gedanken experiment of section  ( [ ecq ] ) supports this interpretation . within the interaction region of figure  ( [ f1 ] ) ,",
    "five dimensional effects occur which cause a deflection of the particle relative to the unvarying neutral geodesics . once free from the interaction , and arriving at @xmath22 ,",
    "the integrated effects of the electromagnetic field leave a residual velocity @xmath45 that is distinct in ontology from the neutral velocity @xmath46 .",
    "this is implicitly defined by the orientation of the five dimensional system , which has an internal geometrical distortion that is not represented in neutral space - time .",
    "this integrated effect persists outside of the interaction region .",
    "it can , in fact , describe aharonov - bohm type effects .",
    "the velocity of the charged particle can not be reduced to the velocity of the neutral particle by a space - time lorentz transformation .",
    "a similar discussion can be made for a fixed gauge weyl theory .",
    "the charge particle motion is varied by the non - riemannian part of the connections which are outside the range of space - time lorentz transformations .",
    "an important property of this description of a quantum state is that there is no formal identification of the mass .",
    "moreover , various different field values @xmath25 can correspond to the motion of a particle having possibly continuously varying value .",
    "there is no inertial frame because arbitrary transformations are allowed .",
    "the motion is inertia free .",
    "this mathematical concept of motion is important to allow the resolution of the very different concepts of inertia that prevail for the interactions studied .",
    "the relation between the physical inertia and its numerical representation is not the same for classical , quantum , and gravitational theories . for gravity ,",
    "inertial effects are independent of the value of the mass , as long as it is nonzero .",
    "electromagnetism has a characteristic @xmath47 value and quantum mechanics scales inversely .    for conventional derivations of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the inertial properties of particles are assumed to be intrinsic and are eventually introduced through the classical hamiltonian or lagrangian .",
    "this , prevents the identification of the mass with the field equations .",
    "this epistemology must be changed in a geometrical construction .",
    "the inertia is fundamental and originates with the quantum processes of diffraction and interference .",
    "these effects must come from the quantum geometrical system without the intervention of classical physics .",
    "measurement of the inertia of a particle must be considered fundamentally quantum .",
    "the classical observation is the good fortune of a simple experiment .",
    "it is in reality a measure of the ratio of the compton wavelength of the test particle to one or more compton wavelengths in the measuring apparatus . in the classical limit ,",
    "the diffraction effects become negligible and inertia , as is classically understood , remains .",
    "the observation of inertia depends on having quantum stabilized dimensional standards .",
    "the observers coordinate system must be calibrated in a consistent , systematic manner  @xcite .",
    "even the elementary demonstration of newton using a bucket of water or spheres connected by a cord refers to sized objects .",
    "a single length standard is represented by a standard clock that is quantum based and measures in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "a bouncing light beam clock requires that the mirrors be held at an absolute space - like distance .",
    "an apparatus to hold the mirrors must be built with atoms , or other quantum objects of constant size determined equivalently by values of @xmath49 .",
    "the only alternative time scale is one based on the planck length .",
    "the relationship is addressed in the work of dirac and others on large numbers  @xcite .",
    "it is supposed here that the planck length may be cosmological rather than fundamental .",
    "the relationship of the planck clock to the atomic clock remains a goal of theoretical and experimental research  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the fine structure constant @xmath50 is an invariant and that any of the time scales which can be formed by @xmath51 are the same .",
    "for such situations as @xmath50 might be allowed to vary , @xmath52 is taken as the fundamental quantity .",
    "other interactions , weak and strong , are presumed unessential to chronometry .",
    "figure  ( [ f2 ] ) shows a quantum clock that avoids these problems and provides a theoretical time standard .    because the mass is taken out of the classical arena",
    ", the phenomenology of spacelike measurements must be carefully reconsidered .",
    "the accepted construction is shown in figure  ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "two particles intersect two spacelike separated points @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "a light beam is sent from particle @xmath55 at time @xmath56 to particle @xmath57 so that it arrives at @xmath58 . the beam is immediately returned to particle @xmath55 arriving at time @xmath59 .",
    "the distance @xmath60 is to be inferred from the measured delays @xmath56 and @xmath59 .",

    "it may in fact be thought to intersect the @xmath61 axis anywhere between @xmath54 and @xmath62 , which are the relativistically allowed limits .",
    "the distance @xmath63 can no longer be measured .",
    "this is a serious metaphysical failure .",
    "even a practical analysis shows that the observational determination of a macroscopic observer s metric for a particular coordinate system can only be done if the experimental system is sufficiently large to be treated classically  @xcite . because of this failure",

    "following mach  @xcite , attempts have been made to associate inertia with gravitational forces by the action of distant objects  @xcite . from the second order calculation made by thirring  @xcite , it is known that there is an effect on inertia . because it is not possible to manipulate the distant objects experimentally ,",
    "the choice between using a relative concept of inertia and an absolute concept is probably to be made by mathematical convenience .",
    "the inertia free description of the five dimensional system can accomplish this .",
    "the usual absence of first order structure is remedied by the fixed gauge construction .",
    "the boundary conditions of mach may then be supplied by the standard quantum ( or hamilton - jacobi ) boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting fixed gauge system has the mathematical capacity to incorporate a fundamental construction of inertia .    with three fields",
    ", there will be three corresponding sets of boundary conditions .",
    "electromagnetic radiation(and the implied acceleration ) is to be related to boundary conditions defined by an external absorber .",
    "gravitational radiation is analogous but more complicated . and for quantum mechanics , the sense of inertia implied by the eigenstates is determined by the space - time boundary conditions .",
    "the separation of these effects may depend on the particular choice of a neutral physical space - time .",
    "the quantum aspects are the more important lowest order effects .",
    "electromagnetic effects , when separated from quantum effects , are first order and gravitational forces are second order .",
    "this supports generally the modern ideas that relate inertia to electromagnetic fields .",
    "the study of the properties of a quantum congruence shows the importance of quantum boundary conditions for the expression of inertia .",
    "consider , as sketched in figure  ( [ f4 ] ) , an experiment consisting of particles that traverse a series of unaligned apertures .",
    "a certain fraction will diffract through each hole in turn and finally be detected .",
    "these can not be said to move on a classical trajectory .",
    "moreover , the number of apertures can be increased indefinitely as long as the they are not too small and the particles are not required to have unattainable velocities .",
    "otherwise , the trajectories are nearly arbitrary .",
    "the loss of particle counts is not important and is actually caused by implied absorptive boundary conditions . rather than",
    "have the particles hit the screens , each aperture could be connected to the previous one by a small tube upon which the wave function is set to zero . in either case , the motion is convoluted but does not require external classical fields . if @xmath64 be chosen everywhere tangent to the probability current density , the five dimensional fixed gauge congruence can describe this motion . by adjusting the five dimensional `` cut '' coordinate transformation to align the vector potential with the local current , a quantum particle can be followed as it traverses the experiment .",
    "the five dimensional geometry is sufficient to describe elementary quantum motion .",
    "fundamental quantum inertia is the constraint put on the trajectories by the geometry as external forces or boundary conditions are applied through the field equations .",

    "overall , there is no generally accepted way of avoiding the objections to hidden variables .",
    "for the purposes of this article it is sufficient to point out a class of geometrical theories that are not subject to the accepted objections .",
    "one of the most serious practical problems is that an assumption of the existence of hidden variables provides no guidance as to how to find them . under these circumstances ,",
    "the question of definition is most important .",
    "it is usually supposed that any reasonable choice would be derived from the classical theory through the system of observables constructed by von - neumann  @xcite .",

    "the mathematics of differential geometry substitutes an inequivalent fundamental structure . since the quantum system is not to be derived from classical physics , the use of differential operators as physical concepts is not required . for the geometrical theories of this paper , classical mechanics",

    "the conditions of von neumann s theorem fail because the hidden variables no longer have to be defined according to his prescription .",
    "while de broglie s hidden variable concept ,  @xcite , is still popular in the minds of many physicists  @xcite , his use of the operator substitution method allows von neumann s argument to prevail .",

    "the accepted quantum discussion depends on the use of operators as physical quantities and neglects relativistic effects .",
    "a careful consideration of the assumptions and arguments of bell s theorem shows under what conditions alternate constructions might be mathematically possible and experimentally acceptable .    a serious weakness of bell s analysis centers around the approximations that are necessary to make a manifestly relativistic or covariant theory non - relativistic .",
    "when applied to alternate theories , bell s objections depend on the presence of an implied classical basis .",
    "this has subtle implications that become part of the quantum interpretation .",
    "moreover , the wave function is hypothesized without any predecessor .",
    "better that the wave function should be part of a geometrical space and not an esoteric representation of some sort of fundamental statistical essence .",
    "in addition , some of the classical properties appended during quantization , especially those relating to causality , are misleading and inappropriate .",
    "radiation is manifestly relativistic and the mathematics and sense of causality that deal with it should be covariant .",
    "the justification of the use of a nonrelativistic limit for radiation comes only from classical physics .",
    "it is this metaphysics of motion in a relativistic field that causes trouble .",
    "it is known that bell s theorem can not be applied to a theory like quantum electrodynamics wherein advanced potentials are used .",
    "such fields , while undesirable in a classical theory , are not forbidden by any concept of fundamental geometry . a fully covariant geometrical theory in which advanced fields are implicit",
    ", may be capable of predicting the non - local results typical of photon correlation experiments .",

    "the implications of such classically imposed causality are subtle . for a fully microscopically deterministic theory , an experiment with _",
    "complete _ arbitrary initial conditions ( in the sense of the einstein , rosen , and podolsky  @xcite ) is not apriori possible .",
    "it is believed that almost any experiment can be done , but only a the small number of initial conditions allowed by the current state of the universe are possible .",
    "the temperature of the experiment must be greater than the ambient noise .",
    "any experiment , because of electromagnetic radiation and distant gravitational interaction may connect with particles at the farthest reaches , past and future . our sense of causality is a large scale observation of these events . a microscopic electromagnetic field that does or does not go backwards in time",
    "can only be included or excluded in so far as it does or does not explain scientific experience .",
    "moreover , since the microscopic structure of quantum mechanics does not have an intrinsic direction , formal symmetry between advanced and retarded potentials must be possible .    for a photon correlation experiment ,",
    "the calculation using the propagators of quantum electrodynamics has essential terms with advanced dependency . because of implicit instantaneous interactions , non - relativistic quantum mechanics implies the use of such fields but also _ represses any explicit reference to them_. since bell s theorem requires that all fields be retarded , the conclusions of this theorem are avoided for quantum systems . even an implicit advanced interaction voids bell s theorem .",
    "it is still unknown , whether in a more complete theory , the presence of advanced potentials must be explicitly displayed or whether they are an artifact of the mathematical methods . because of the demonstration by experiment",
    ", such interactions must be integrated into the theory despite the counter - intuitive indications of classical physics .",
    "it is easy to show that the common geometrical theories already contain advanced potentials .",
    "since a congruence of motion is to be well defined , it must represent all physical effects .",
    "in particular , the force of radiative reaction must be included .",
    "this must be introduced into the vector potential by the advanced potentials of other interacting particles .",
    "the final overall prediction need not be interpreted as an advanced propagation of information or energy .",
    "a fixed gauge system that includes all electromagnetic forces must be exempt from bell s theorem .",
    "the relationship of geometrical theories to these accepted experiments is important .",
    "most measurements use photon correlations . for the present development of the geometrical description",
    "there is no reason to consider calculations which are not equivalent to quantum electrodynamics .",

    "there are also correlation experiments that involve particles . in the case where the interaction between the particles is mediated by electromagnetic fields",
    ", the elementary geometrical theory should be sufficient .",
    "the nuclear experiments that use spin polarization  @xcite give important results for weak and strong interactions .",
    "formal predictions for these fields are not possible because the geometrical structure used here is insufficient . physically , though it is possible to argue that the results are not incongruent",
    ". the use of advanced potentials for other fields should be adequate to predict the observed result .",
    "in particular , the effects of spin during scattering do not seem to be time asymmetric .",
    "these results should be explainable using the nuclear equivalent of time symmetric potentials .",
    "the principle of equivalence is expected to have further extensions so that even spin couplings are replaced by the effects of covariant geometrical fields .",
    "the entanglement of multiparticle states is assumed to be the integrated effect of the physical interaction that causes the state to form .",
    "the entangled states described early by schrdinger ,  @xcite , that are so characteristic of quantum mechanics are interpreted as a persistent geometrical distortion that is inseparable from the interaction that connects the particles .",
    "time symmetric electrodynamics , developed as a classical theory  @xcite must be modified to allow for quantum effects .",
    "the macroscopic classical approximation must be the limit of the quantum mechanical transitions that really occur .",
    "the use of the classical theory as the metaphysical precursor of the quantum field leads to confusion .",
    "this sort of quantum electrodynamics has been applied to cosmological situations  @xcite .",
    "therein , the quantization of time symmetric electrodynamics ,  @xcite is based on classical physics . the unusual predicted results with respect to absorption and emission seem to be due to the assumptions of those classical properties before the quantization is accomplished . the confusion is related to the similarity of classical electrodynamics to possible primitive geometrical forms of electrodynamics .",
    "a precise notion of classical absorption or emission can not be defined until the fundamental processes of discrete quantum absorption or emission are understood .",
