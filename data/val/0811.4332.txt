    "current projects to increase the density of ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) available for physics experiments employ neutron converters of superfluid helium ( he - ii ) @xcite and solid deuterium @xcite . in these materials",
    "cold neutrons with energies in the order of mev may be scattered down to the nev energy range by the excitation of a single phonon or multiphonon in the converter .",
    "the inverse process is suppressed by the boltzmann factor if the converter is kept at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "we consider ucn production in he - ii , for which first publications have focused on the single phonon process , where incident @xmath4    neutrons are scattered down to the ucn energy range @xcite .",
    "later two publications korobkina2002,schott2003 have set out to calculate the expected ucn production rate from processes involving the emission of two or more excitations but reached contradicting results .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide on the one hand a physical - model - based extrapolation to short wavelengths of scattering data relevant for ucn production . on the other hand we consider for the first time ucn production in he - ii under pressure",
    "this is motivated by the pressure dependence of the properties of he - ii , in particular its dispersion curve and density .",
    "application of pressure to he - ii increases the velocity of sound , such that the dispersion curves of he - ii and of the free neutron cross at shorter neutron wavelength . for neutron beams from a neutron guide coupled to a liquid deuterium cold source , the differential flux density @xmath5 in the range @xmath6    normally increases for decreasing wavelength .",
    "pressure also increases the density of he - ii .",
    "these two facts may lead to the expectation that the single phonon ucn production rate increases with pressure .",
    "furthermore , the multiphonon contributions might be favourably affected by application of pressure .",
    "this justifies to investigate whether pressure may provide an ucn source superior to a converter at saturated vapour pressure ( svp ) .",
    "the first part of this paper presents some general expressions for the ucn production rate in he - ii as given in an internal note in 1982 by pendlebury @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the second part we consider ucn production due to multiphonon scattering both for svp and for 20  bar , using inelastic scattering data for he - ii measured at 0.5  k@xcite .",
    "we give a formula approximating the contribution from multiphonon processes to the ucn production rate .",
    "this might be useful to calculate , for any given spectrum of incident neutrons , the expected ucn production rate .",
    "as an example , this is done here for the cold neutron beam pf1b at the institut laue langevin .",
    "ucn production in superfluid helium is due to coherent inelastic scattering of the incident cold neutrons with energy @xmath7 ( and wavenumber @xmath8 ) down to energies @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the maximum final energy is defined by the wall potential of the converter vessel ( @xmath11  nev for beryllium ) with respect to the fermi potential of he - ii ( 18.5  nev at svp ) : @xmath12  nev .",
    "the production rate is given by          where @xmath18 is the neutron scattering length of @xmath19he , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the dynamic scattering function evaluated for values on the dispersion curve of the free neutron .",
    "details of calculation can be found in ref.@xcite where the general result is given in eq.(9 ) .",
    "we may write          the single phonon contribution can be approximated by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the neutron wavelength at the intersection of the dispersion curves of the free neutron and the helium ( @xmath33  @xmath34 for svp ) , and @xmath35 denotes the intensity due to single phonon emission .",
    "evaluation of the single - phonon ucn production rate yields              .factors relevant for single phonon production rate deduced from ref.@xcite .",
    "an increase in flux of a factor @xmath42 , going from @xmath4    to @xmath43    is necessary to compensate for the loss in intensity .",
