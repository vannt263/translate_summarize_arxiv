    "the diamond chain is a one - dimensional lattice spin system in which the vertical spin dimers alternate with single spins(see figure [ fig - lat ] ) .",
    "this model with @xmath1 is believed to describe the magnetic lattice of mineral azurite , cu@xmath2(co@xmath2)@xmath3(oh)@xmath3 , which is famous for its deep blue pigmentation@xcite .",

    "diamond chain and especially diamond chain with mixed @xmath4 spin are shown to have very rich ground state phase diagrams with haldane and several spin - cluster states which are tensor product of exact local eigenstates of cluster spins @xcite .",
    "many other issues of diamond chain physics have been investigated theoretically during last years including dzyaloshinsky - moriya term influence on magnetization processes@xcite , multiple - spin - exchange effects@xcite , magnetization plateaus@xcite , magnetocaloric effect@xcite , e.t.c .",
    "very recently another one interesting feature of diamond chain , possibility of localized magnon excitations , has been also investigated@xcite .",
    "especially important issue is the effect of frustration , which is rather strong in antiferromagnetic diamond chain because of triangular arrangement of the sites",
    ". variants of frustrated recurrent lattices with diamond plaquette have been also studied in refs . @xcite and @xcite . however , diamond chain is not integrable in general .",
    "thus , the exact analysis of the dynamic and especially thermodynamic properties of diamond chain is a very complicated issue .",
    "nevertheless , one can consider various exactly solvable variants of spin systems possessing diamond chain topology of interaction bonds with simplified structure of interactions@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the diamond chain with only ising type of interaction have been exactly solved within classical transfer - matrix technique in ref .",
    "@xcite revealing reach @xmath0 ground state phase diagram .",
    "yet another exactly solvable diamond chains have been considered in refs .",

    "considering the mixed spin chains ( or another one - dimensional spin systems with more complicated geometry ) with ising and heisenberg bonds ( or even just ising counterparts of the known quantum spin models ) one can achieve two - fold goal : to construct novel exactly solvable lattice spin model which allow one to obtain analytic expression for all thermodynamic functions of the model , and to get an approximate models which can be useful for understanding the properties of underlying purely quantum models @xcite .",
    "exact thermodynamic solutions of such models even can shed a light to the properties of real magnetic materials .",

    "5 a short summary is followed .",
    "let us consider the system of vertical @xmath15 spin dimers with heisenberg @xmath5 bilinear and biquadratic interactions and uniaxial single - ion anisotropy .",
    "these dimers are assembled to the chain by alternating with ising spins @xmath18 , so that each spin @xmath6 in certain dimer interacts to its both left and right ising spins via ising type interaction ( see figure [ fig - lat ] ) .",
    "so , we have the so  called diamond  chain with @xmath15 heisenberg dimers and @xmath19 ising spins between them .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is the sum over the block hamiltonians :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of the unit cells ( blocks with two spin-1 and one spin-1/2 ) , while @xmath22 correspond the particles at @xmath22-cell .",
    "@xmath23 being the coupling constant of bilinear @xmath5-interaction between heisenberg spins , which we assume to be of the following form    @xmath24    whereas @xmath25 denotes the biquadratic xxz - interaction term , @xmath26 means the single ion - anisotropy and @xmath27 being the purely ising interaction term . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the external magnetic field acting on @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .    in order to solve this model , at first , we need to diagonalize the block hamiltonian for arbitrary @xmath22-th block .",
    "nine eigenvalues of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 can be found analytically , which write down as    @xmath35,\\nonumber \\\\ \\lambda_{3,4 } & = & \\delta(j+\\delta k)+d\\pm [ -h_{1}+j_{0}(\\sigma_{i}+\\sigma_{i+1})],\\nonumber \\\\ \\lambda_{5,6 } & = & -\\delta(j-\\delta k)+d\\pm [ -h_{1}+j_{0}(\\sigma_{i}+\\sigma_{i+1})],\\nonumber \\\\ \\lambda_{7 } & = & -j+k+2d,\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eig } \\lambda_{8,9 } & = & \\frac{-j+(1 + 4\\delta^{2})k+2d}{2}\\pm\\frac{1}{2}r,\\ ] ]    where for simplicity @xmath36 denotes the following expression , , @xmath37    the eigenvectors of block hamiltonian @xmath32 up to the inversion of all spins are    @xmath38 and @xmath39 in first(second ) place stand for the @xmath40 and @xmath39 states for first(second ) spin in vertical dimer and the following notation is adopted :    @xmath41    the eigenvectors of the dimer defined by @xmath42 corresponds to the parallel ordered spins with magnetization per site @xmath43 , the eigenvectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric states vector respectively , whereas @xmath46 is an antisymmetric state vector with magnetization @xmath47 , finally @xmath48 are the symmetric eigenvectors with magnetization @xmath47 .",
    "the remaining eigenvectors of the eigenvalues @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be obtaining using the spin inversion .",
    "at the special value @xmath52 the @xmath53 sector of the block hamiltonian undergoes qualitative changes which can be obtained substituting carefully @xmath52 value into the general solution presented above in eq .. this should be considered as a consequence of the special symmetry of the hamiltonian for these values of parameters , more precisely , the fact that operator @xmath54 can be represented in terms of permutation operators @xmath55 . in this case the eigenstates @xmath46 and @xmath48 of the hamiltonian reduce to the following ones    @xmath56 ground states phase diagrams ----------------------------    let us describe possible @xmath0 ground states of the chain under consideration and the corresponding energies per block .",
    "generally speaking , there are @xmath57 possible ground states for each block .",
    "however , if one restricts himself with the ground states which are equivalent up to the inversion of all spins one will arrive at the following spin configurations .",
    "the fully polarized state ( @xmath58 , here @xmath59 is magnetization per spin ) @xmath60(@xmath61 ) stands for the up(down ) state of the @xmath18-spin in the @xmath22-th block .",
    "hereafter , we also put @xmath29=@xmath28=@xmath62 .",
    "the next sector of ground states contains three different ferrimagnetic spin configurations with the value of magnetization equal to 3/5 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath63 there are also four another ferrimagnetic ground states with @xmath16 :    @xmath64    when no external magnetic field is applied , there are also possibility of frustrated ground state formation , in which the orientation of @xmath18 spins in each block are not defined . in this case",

    "there are two frustrated ground states @xmath65    here @xmath66 stands for arbitrary value of the @xmath18 spin in the @xmath22-th block .",
    "thus , for @xmath67 if @xmath15 dimer has @xmath53 then its neighboring @xmath18-spins become decoupled which results in macroscopic non - zero entropy @xmath68 for each of the frustrated ground states of eq . [ eq : frus ] . applying magnetic field one removes the two - fold macroscopic degeneracy driving @xmath69 and @xmath70 ground states into @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . nevertheless , in some papers two last non - degenerated ground states of eqs .",
    "are mentioned as frustrated ones @xcite .    hereafter , to discuss the phase diagrams we will consider the external magnetic field as @xmath29=@xmath28=@xmath62 .",
    "it is also convenient to present all parameters in the units of @xmath73 .",

    "one can see four ground states phase diagrams plotted in ( @xmath78,@xmath79)-plane demonstrating vast variety of ground states for fixed values of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "the phase diagram exhibits the appearance of two frustrated ground states at zero magnetic field .",
    "we choose @xmath119 and rather small value of biquadratic interactions @xmath120 . for convenience",
    "we normalize parameters by @xmath121 .",
    "the equations for the phase boundaries are @xmath122 here @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the present model could be solved exactly using the known decoration transformation early presented by m. e. fisher@xcite , and recently generalized for arbitrary spin interactions@xcite , where one maps the partition function of the system to the partition function of 1d ising model , writing down the relations for the entries of transfer matrix and thus obtaining the relations between model parameters and that of ising chain .",
    "but here we implement a direct transfer matrix calculations without any account to the solution of ising chain .",
    "therefore let us consider the following partition function of the system , which can be represented as    @xmath125    where @xmath126 as usual is inverse temperature . here",
    "@xmath127    then , using one can express the one - block _ partial _ partition function @xmath128 in the following form : @xmath129 after that , the partition function take the form similar to the partition function of a chain with classical two state variables on each site : @xmath130 where @xmath131 are two eigenvalues of the transfer - matrix @xmath132 where @xmath133 then , calculating the eigenvalues and taking thermodynamic limit , when only the largest eigenvalue survives , one arrives at the following expression for the free energy per block : @xmath134 as soon as the free energy per block is calculated , one can obtain analytic expressions for all thermodynamic function .",

    "<S> an exactly solvable variant of mixed spin-(1/2,1 ) ising - heisenberg diamond chain is considered . </S>",
    "<S> vertical spin-1 dimers are taken as quantum ones with heisenberg bilinear and biquadratic interactions and with single - ion anisotropy , while all interactions between spin-1 and spin-1/2 residing on the intermediate sites are taken in the ising form . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed analysis of the @xmath0 ground state phase diagram is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams have shown to be rather rich , demonstrating large variety of ground states : saturated one , three ferrimagnetic with magnetization equal to 3/5 and another four ferrimagnetic ground states with magnetization equal to 1/5 . </S>",
    "<S> there are also two frustrated macroscopically degenerated ground states which could exist at zero magnetic filed . solving the model exactly within classical transfer - matrix formalism we obtain an exact expressions for all thermodynamic function of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic properties of the model have been described exactly by exact calculation of partition function within the direct classical transfer - matrix formalism , the entries of transfer matrix , in their turn , contain the information about quantum states of vertical spin-1 xxz dimer ( eigenvalues of local hamiltonian for vertical link ) . </S>"
