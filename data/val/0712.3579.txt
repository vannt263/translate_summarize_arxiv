    "in relatively few extragalactic radio jets can the kinematics of the flow on kpc scales be studied with any degree of certainty .",
    "most arguments are indirect , relying either on beaming statistics for samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or , for powerful jets oriented along the line of sight , on models relying on an assumed inverse - compton origin for the x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the few low - power radio galaxies with heavily studied , straight , radio jets and counterjets , kinematic models have been constructed based on the jet - counterjet asymmetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these models have supported jet deceleration through mass entrainment , and ongoing work has already shown consistency between the density and pressure model inferred from the jet and the properties of the external x - ray - emitting gas for 3c31 @xcite .    in models of mass entrainment ,",
    "the outer parts ( `` sheath '' ) are decelerated before the inner ( `` spine '' ) , consistent with a range of observational evidence at radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "applied to more central regions , the consequence that emission from a slower sheath becomes relatively more important in jets at larger angle to the line of sight then resolves difficulties in models that unify bl lac objects with low power radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ chandra _  has not only allowed confirmation that x - ray synchrotron emission in low - power jets is common @xcite , but has also resolved transverse structure in the nearest and brightest sources .",
    "a particularly interesting example is  @xcite . here",
    "the diffuse emission contains a knotty structure in the radio and x - ray that appears to describe an oscillatory filament .",
    "although the structure could be the result of a chance superposition of non - axisymmetric knots , the level of coherence led us to suggest that the knots might be predominantly a surface feature residing in the shear layer between the spine and sheath .",
    "if this latter interpretation is correct , we might expect the x - ray spectra of the knots to be similar across the transverse width of the jet .    in the case of",
    "the distinct knotty emission is only about 10% of the total emission in x - rays and radio along the @xmath0 kpc of projected jet length over which it is detected , and with a source distance of @xmath1  mpc the observations did not allow us to measure separate x - ray spectra for the knots and diffuse emission . at 3.7  mpc ( 1  arcmin is @xmath2  kpc projected length ) , centaurus  a is a much closer example of a low - power radio galaxy whose inner jet shows bright resolved x - ray knots and diffuse emission over a similar projected length scale to  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here we report an x - ray spectral study of the transverse structure of the jet , and in particular we investigate whether the  knots are likely to occupy a shear layer between faster inner and slower outer flows .",

    "the inner spine and sheath regions are at a distance of @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and the outer region runs from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "we call the region marked in blue , near the outer extent of the inner region , the `` bright '' region . ]",
    "the _ chandra _ data used here are from the  very large project ( -vlp ) , comprising six deep ( @xmath9  ks ) exposures ( obsids 7797 , 7798 , 7799 , 7800 , 8489 , 8490 ) of the front - illuminated ccd chips of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) made between 2007 march 7 and may 30 .",
    "standard methods have been followed for data re - processing and grade selection , and small astrometric corrections were made to register the six exposures to a common frame using detected point sources @xcite .",
    "the 0.8 - 3  kev merged image of the inner @xmath10 of the x - ray jet is shown in figure  [ fig : jet ] .",
    "we are interested here in the jet after it has become radiatively bright in both radio and x - ray ( more than @xmath6 from the core , and after knots ax1a , ax1c in the terminology of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) until its major decline relative to the radio ( at @xmath11 ) .",
    "motivated by , where the fast spine is approximately 60% of the jet width , we have defined regions shown in figure  [ fig : jetregions ] . while not wishing to suggest _ a priori _ that the  jet does have a slower sheath and faster spine , for shorthand we call these regions the _ spine _ , _ sheath _ and _ background _ , working outwards from the jet axis .",
    "compact sources excluded from the background regions are also marked .",
    "a division of the spine and sheath into two regions with length down the jet is shown .",
    "we refer to these as the _ inner _ and _ outer _ regions , and the boundary was chosen so that there is a comparable number of total counts in each region .",
    "the jet is positioned on a single acis i chip in all six exposures .",
    "the boundary between the outer and inner regions lies between 1.4 and 4.0 arcmin off axis depending on obsid , giving a point - spread - function ( psf ) half - power - diameter ( hpd ) at this location of better than about 1 arcsec at the @xmath12-kev energy of maximum count rate per kev .",
    "the readout streak from the  core runs close to the se sheath region in obsid 7797 , and so we exclude this observation in spectral fitting to the se sheath and inner spine .",
    "we extract data and responses for identical sky regions in the different obsids , and we fit the same model simultaneously to the data sets .",
    "spectra are binned to a minimum of 30 counts per bin so that the @xmath13 statistic can be applied .    in this work",
    "we are searching for statistical trends in spectral index in knotty and diffuse emission transverse to the jet axis .",
    "knots are identified as bright enhancements , but we believe them to be composed of multiple distinct physical structures , each potentially with a different emission spectrum .",
    "the precise definition of knots is therefore not crucial , and we have adopted the previously published lists of @xcite and @xcite , which combined give 31 knots within our total spine and sheath regions . the knots were examined visually , and small centroid shifts ( within uncertainties ) were made to give best alignment in the new data .",
    "a circle of nominal radius 2.4 arcsec was used to mask each knot .",
    "four additional weak but compact enhancements seen in the new data were also masked as knots with circles of radii 1.2 arcsec .",
    "because of our interest in statistical trends , for knots that overlap regions we divide the counts according to where they were detected .",
    "when extracting spectra of the knots the diffuse ( residual ) emission in the corresponding region is used as background .",
    "the outer sectors shown in figure  [ fig : jetregions ] provide background for the diffuse emission .",
    "all our spectral models are single - component power laws with free hydrogen column density , @xmath14 , over the energy range 0.410 kev .",
    "intrinsic @xmath14 in  over and above the galactic value of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite causes reductions in the count rate in soft x - ray images , consistent with the dust lanes that cross the jet roughly transverse to its axis .",
    "since our regions extend hundreds of pc along the jet , we are combining data with different intrinsic @xmath14 .",
    "this is expected to give a bias towards finding slightly flatter power - law slopes than the true slope if the jet emission is characterized by a single spectrum over its length .",
    "however , the gradients in @xmath14 are principally down the jet and not across the jet , and so provide similar weightings when we compare sections transverse to the jet axis .",
    "we can thus use the fitted @xmath14 and spectral index for our transverse sections of the jet as proxies of systematic trends in the spectra .",
    "appreciable cross - jet differences could then allow us to conclude that there are real variations in the x - ray spectrum across the jet .",
    "self - consistency tests ( see  [ sec : results ] ) verify this assertion .",
    "we also find , through comparison with the spectra of individual knots and sections of diffuse emission along the jet @xcite , that any bias in spectral slope in our analysis is small .",

    "having established that the knots in the sheath have a steeper spectrum than in the spine , we checked the inner and outer regions to see if there is any trend with distance from the core . comparing rows 9 and 10 with 11 and 12 ,",
    "we see the expected preference for a higher @xmath14 in the inner regions , but more interestingly we see that it is only for the knots in the inner regions that the spine and sheath spectra differ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ) .",
    "the diffuse emission , in contrast , shows remarkable spectral agreement between the sheath and spine in the inner region ( rows 13 & 14 ) . to check that the contour separation in figure  [ fig : contours ] is causal rather than statistical we have drawn random sets of the required size from the modelled underlying spectral - index distribution deduced from all knots in the inner region",
    "the average spectral index has an error on the mean of @xmath57 for knots matching in number those in the inner spine , and @xmath58 for the inner sheath .",
    "the observed spectral - index difference , @xmath59 ( fig .  [ fig : contours ] ) , therefore significantly exceeds the difference expected from random subsamples of the distribution .    since the spine",
    "inner jet knots tend to lie in regions of higher @xmath14 than the sheath inner knots ( figs  [ fig : jetregions ] and [ fig : contours ] ) , we have repeated the analysis only for the `` bright '' region , marked in blue on figure  [ fig : jetregions ] .",
    "this region is beyond the main dust lanes that cross the jet ( e.g. , fig .  1 of * ? ?",
    "results are consistent with sheath knots having steeper spectra than spine knots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contours2 ] , and rows 17 & 18 ) .",
    "simulations show that the bias (  2 ) on the absolute value of mean spectral index from the @xmath14 distribution over the inner jet is @xmath60 .",
    "we investigated the possibility that the spectral flattening in the inner spine might result from the inner knots being brighter , if brightness is associated with particle - acceleration efficiency .",
    "figure  [ fig : inknotprofile ] shows the knot surface brightness and hardness across the inner jet .",
    "the bin - width is 1 degree in position angle , which corresponds roughly to the hpd at an average jet - axis distance , and so the points are not highly correlated .",
    "the hardness ratio shows the decrease with increasing distance from the jet axis that is anticipated from our spectral results , with a high degree of confidence that the hardness is not constant .",
    "the gradual decrease of hardness with distance from the jet axis shows that our finding of a spectral difference in the spine and sheath regions was not dictated by the _ a priori _ definition of the region boundaries .     for 11 dof for a fit to constant hardness ) .",
    "there is no trend for regions of higher integrated knot surface brightness to show harder spectra . ]",
    "perhaps surprisingly , a comparison of the panels of figure  [ fig : inknotprofile ] shows that there is no trend for regions of higher integrated knot surface brightness to be harder in spectrum .",
    "we have made plots similar to figure  [ fig : inknotprofile ] for the inner and outer diffuse emission , and the outer knot emission .",
    "the surface - brightness profiles of diffuse emission show some lumpiness , suggesting that some of what we call diffuse emission is composed of lower - surface - brightness knots , but all three hardness - ratio profiles are consistent with being constant across the jet ( @xmath13 values of 10.5 , 7.9 , and 14.8 for 11 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , as compared with @xmath13 = 116 in fig .  [",
    "fig : inknotprofile ] ) .",
    "if the knots in  were predominantly a surface feature in a shear layer between the spine and sheath , as we suggested might be the case for , one would expect the knot x - ray spectra to be similar across the jet .",
    "this is not what is seen . in the inner jet , between @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the core",
    ", we have observed in a statistical sense that the x - ray knot spectra steepen farther from the jet axis .",
    "no such trend is seen in the more diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the results suggest that knots are distributed throughout the jet volume , with a trend towards steeper spectra in the outer regions .",
    "the trend will then be underestimated in our results because of projection effects .",
    "although the spectral trends disfavor knot confinement in a shear layer , they imply that the electron energy distributions in knots towards the center and edge of the jet are different .",
    "electrons with sufficient energy to emit synchrotron x - rays must be accelerated locally to the knots , since their energy loss timescale is short compared with any dynamical timescale associated with fluid motion .",
    "thus the conditions for particle acceleration differ across the jet .",
    "the knots might arise from intruders from outside travelling at speeds close to the stellar velocity dispersion , or internal flow irregularities which are most likely to arise in the central part of the flow and might be expected to move quickly towards the edge of the jet under the influence of circulation in the shear layer . in either case",
    "a transverse velocity structure might cause the strength of shocks near the knots to vary across the jet , and since the kinetic energy density of the flow should be higher nearer the jet axis , we might also expect velocity irregularities to generate stronger turbulent cascades near the axis than near the jet edge , with consequent efficient particle acceleration @xcite and a flatter on - axis x - ray spectrum .",
    "as the jet expands , the lower on - axis flow velocity , as suggested by the less collimated appearance of the jet further from the core , would then imply less x - ray spectral difference between sheath and spine , consistent with our results .",
    "indeed , a spectral steepening between the inner and outer regions in diffuse x - ray emission may relate to such a decline in flow speed along the jet ( rows 13 to 16 of table  [ tab : specresults ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether it will be possible to detect knot migration in .",
    "expansion of the jet along its axis , with apparent motions of about @xmath61 , has been measured in radio data from the very large array over 10 years @xcite , but lateral motion is more difficult to measure . it has been detected in the radio in m87 @xcite .",
    "we speculate that transverse motions should be present in the knots and are potentially detectable if knots are flow irregularities , although future observations may be required .",
    "these new observations of  have permitted the first x - ray spectral study of a radio jet in the transverse direction , separating knotty and more diffuse emission .",
    "we have found the striking result that where the x - ray emission is brightest , at @xmath62 to 1.2 kpc from the core , the spectrum in the knotty emission is steeper at larger distances from the jet axis .",
    "we speculate that this is the result of lateral knot migration .",
