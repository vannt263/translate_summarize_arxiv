    "in black hole systems , the central black hole accretion process is believed to be the dominated energy producing mechanism , sometimes also accompanied with a relativistic jet .",
    "observationally , such kinds of disk - jet systems display similar characteristics of strong x - ray and radio emissions , and exist at different scales from the stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "recently the non - linear relationship among the central x - ray emission , core radio emission and black hole mass , also called as the black hole fundamental plane , has been investigated in details both theoretically and observationally ( eg . merloni et al .",
    "2003 , heinz & sunyaev 2003 , falcke et al .",
    "this relationship may directly reflect the common physics of a disk - jet system around the black hole .",
    "the radio  x - ray correlation has been widely studied in the galactic black hole candidates @xcite and has been also extended to agns @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated a sample of ten low / hard state galaxy black hole x - ray binaries and found that all sources in the low / hard state follow a universal power - law relation between the radio and x - ray emissions with a slope of 0.7 ( i.e. @xmath2 ) .",
    "additionally , they suggested that when the system enters the hard to soft transition state the jet is suppressed and the radio emission drops .",
    "@xcite collected a large sample containing both galactic black hole x - ray binaries and agns , and gave a fundamental plane relation among the radio luminosity ( l@xmath3 ) , x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath4 ) and black hole mass ( m@xmath5 ) .",
    "their result can be expressed as @xmath6 and the power - law slope of the radio  x - ray relation is consistent with that previously obtained for stellar black hole systems @xcite .",
    "physics explanations on the derived radio  x ray correlation have been also widely discussed .",
    "the radio emission is always believed to be the synchrotron radiation from the jet while the x - ray emission can come from both the accretion flow and the relativistic jet in a disk - jet system . at high accretion rate",
    "the x - ray emission is mainly from accretion flow and its dependence on black hole mass and accretion rate can be different according to different accretion disk model @xcite .",
    "@xcite has investigated the cases of several different disk models and found a good agreement between their fitting result and the radiation inefficient accretion flow models . when the accretion rate drops , the x - ray emission declines according to these models .",
    "below a certain critical value ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the eddington luminosity ) , the jet emission will become dominant @xcite .",
    "in such a low state where jet dominates the x - ray emission , the power - law slope of the radio  x - ray relation should be greater than 1 @xcite .",
    "this means that when the x - ray emission is dominated by jet , the slope of the fundamental plane relation is probably different from the case when the x - ray emission is dominated by the accretion flow .",
    "however , the reliability of the fundamental plane relation given by @xcite has been questioned .",
    "recently @xcite pointed out that the fundamental plane relation in @xcite can be led out even with those sources having only upper limit of radio emission or by scrambling the radio fluxes and making them randomly assigned to the sources in the whole sample .",
    "in addition , the sample in @xcite has the ratios of x - ray luminosity to eddington luminosity in a large range , from lower than @xmath9 to 1 .",
    "so the x - ray luminosity may have different dominated mechanisms according to different level of luminosities and thus has different dependences on the accretion rate according to the accretion disk models .",
    "this may cause significant scatters of the intrinsic black hole fundamental plane relation .",
    "furthermore , the sample in @xcite consists of both galactic and extragalactic sources with estimated black hole mass and is therefore not uniform .",
    "various selection effects may also seriously affect the derived black hole fundamental plan relation .",
    "in this paper we select a uniform sample of broad line agns based on the cross - identifications of rosat all - sky survey , sloan digital sky survey and first 20 cm radio survey . with this sample",
    "we can possibly avoid the bias from both the inhomogeneous source selections and the data quality differences , and then better study the black hole fundamental plane relation for broad line agns . the sample selection and data reduction process",
    "are described in section 2 and statistical results are given in section 3 .",
    "the possible theoretical explanations are discussed in section 4 .    through out this paper , we adopt the cosmology model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "our sample is selected from the x - ray emitting sdss agn catalog @xcite and the first 20 cm radio survey @xcite .",
    "the agn catalog of @xcite was selected based on the cross - identifications of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the rass and sdss are extremely well - matched both in the detection area and sensitivity . with the additional information from the first radio observations , about @xmath13 rass x - ray sources",
    "are searched for the sdss optical counterparts . as an initial and important result ,",
    "@xcite obtained a uniform sample of more than 1200 x - ray emitting quasars and other agns over the 1400 deg@xmath14 of the sky , including 964 broad permitted line agns ( fwhm@xmath151000km / s ) , 216 narrow permitted line agns ( fwhm@xmath161000km / s ) and 45 bl lac candidates .",
    "one of the benefits of this sample , as @xcite pointed out , is that the rass and sdss survey area is also covered by the first 20 cm radio survey .",
    "so we select all the first radio detected sources in the broad line agn catalog and finally construct a rosat - sdss - first cross - identified sample of 132 broad permitted line agns .",
    "all of these 132 sources have 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray measurement from rass and 1.4ghz radio measurement from the first 20 cm survey .",
    "the optical spectra of these sources are available from the sdss data archive , which can be used to estimate the central black hole masses of them . for this purpose",
    "we analyze the sdss spectra and the data reduction process is described in the following section .",
    "we examined all of the 132 spectra first with an aim that we can finally estimate the black hole mass of agns with broad permitted lines ( eg .",
    "@xmath17 ) .",
    "we excluded the spectra in poor quality ( with no visible emission lines ) or with no h@xmath18 or mgii @xmath192798 lines in the observation wavelength .",
    "at last we get the final sample of 115 objects with black hole mass estimatable from either h@xmath20 or mgii @xmath192798 broad emission line @xcite .",
    "one thing should be mentioned is that there are four high redshift ( @xmath21 ) sources with only the civ @xmath191549 broad emission line available for black hole mass estimation in their sdss spectra .",
    "because we want to reduce the scatters in black hole mass introduced by different mass estimation methods and the number of these high redshift sources is rather small , we exclude these four source in our analysis as well .",
    "we made the corrections for the galactic extinction and redshift effects and subtracted the iron emission from the continuum .",
    "the uv and optical iron templates were adopted from @xcite and @xcite in the wavelength range 1250@xmath22 and 4250@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "then we fit the continuum and emission lines with the _ mpfit _ package in idl , which was developed based on the levenberg - marquardt technique .",
    "the continuum fitting process was performed in the two iron template windows respectively .",
    "then we fit each band of the continuum with a power - law and calculate the rest - frame continuum flux density at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . for high redshift sources ,",
    "the rest - frame optical band moves out of the sdss window and the @xmath25 flux density can not be fitted directly .",
    "so we extrapolate the power law fitting in the uv band to the optical band and calculate the @xmath25 flux density for these sources .",
    "finally we fit the emission lines with the gaussian profiles .",
    "we apply one gaussian component for mgii @xmath26 line and two gaussians for the broad and narrow components for h@xmath27 . from the fittings we can get the values of flux and fwhm of these emission lines .",
    "the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and h@xmath18 luminosities , as well as the 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray luminosity with data from rass and rest frame 1.4ghz radio luminosity with data from first , are calculated for these 115 agns .",
    "we also derive their rest - frame 5ghz flux from the 1.4ghz data by assuming a power - law index of 0.5 ( i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "then the radio loudness is derived with the rest frame @xmath25 and 5ghz flux density according to the definition @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the radio loud and radio quiet sources are divided by @xmath30 .",
    "our sample consists of 39 radio quiet sources and 76 radio loud sources .",
    "finally , the black hole masses for all of these 115 sources are estimated .",
    "for the broad line agns , the black hole mass can be estimated with the velocity and radius of the broad line region ( blr ) using the formula in @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the broad emission lines and @xmath33 is the radius of the broad line region .    for the sources with h@xmath27 line measured ,",
    "@xmath32 is the fwhm of the broad component of h@xmath18 emission line and @xmath33 can be determined using the broad h@xmath18 line luminosity ( @xmath34 ) with the empirical relation provided by @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath35    for the sources with only mgii @xmath36 line available , we adopt the empirical relation provided by @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath24 continuum luminosity and @xmath39 is the fwhm of the mgii emission line .",
    "in this part we list some properties of our broad line agn sample .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] gives the total 115 sources with the sdss optical source name , redshift , logarithm black hole mass in m@xmath40 , logarithm 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray luminosity , logarithm rest frame 1.4ghz radio luminosity , and logarithm radio loudness in different columns .",
    "the sample include 39 radio quiet and 76 radio loud agns . in fig .",
    "[ six ] we show the histograms of redshift , logarithm radio loudness ( logr ) , 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray ( l@xmath1 ) and 1.4ghz radio ( l@xmath0 ) luminosities , black hole mass ( m ) , and the logarithm ratio of x - ray to the eddington luminosity .",
    "the redshift range for our sample is from 0.04 to nearly 2 .",
    "the logarithm black hole masses distribute from about 6.7 to 9.7 .",
    "both the x - ray and radio luminosity distributions are in a broad range and cover more than 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "additionally , the x - ray to eddington luminosity ratio distributes from about 10@xmath41 to 1 .    in fig .",
    "[ mbin ] we plot the radio luminosity against the x - ray luminosity with different symbols denoting different black hole mass bins . in the left panel",
    "we plot the logarithm luminosity while in the right panel we scale the luminosity with the eddington luminosity .",
    "we do not see the clear trends that tracks of different mass bins are parallel to each other as that found in the former study @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ rbin ] we re - plot the radio and x - ray luminosity , according to different radio loudness bins .",
    "we find that the sources obviously distributes in different parallel tracks according to different radio loudness .",
    "in this section we present the correlation tests for the three fundamental plane variables , l@xmath0 , l@xmath1 , and m , and then give the fitting results .",
    "first of all , we perform the partial kendall s @xmath42 test @xcite as did in @xcite to test the intrinsic correlation among the three fundamental plane parameters ( i.e. m , l@xmath1 , and l@xmath0 ) , and in addition , among the eddington luminosity scaled luminosities and black hole mass .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] shows the results of this test , namely whether the correlation between x and y is intrinsic or is only introduced by a third variable z. the first three columns list the variables , the forth and fifth columns give the sub - sample type and number of object , and the last three columns list the partial kendall s @xmath42 correlation coefficient , the square root of the calculated variance @xmath43 , and the probability to accept the null hypothesis .",
    "the null hypothesis will be rejected with a probability less than the significance level ( i.e. @xmath44 ) .    for the correlation between luminosities , the same dependence on the source distance",
    "always confuses the intrinsic physical relation .",
    "this is the main reason why the reality of the black hole fundamental plane relation is suspected @xcite .",
    "however , the partial correlation tests indeed prove that the luminosities are still strongly correlated even if the effect of distance is excluded . furthermore , in order to avoid the distance effect we test the existence of the intrinsic relationship between radio and x - ray emissions by comparing the radio and x - ray fluxes of the agns in our sample . in fig .  [ frx ]",
    "we plot the rest frame 1.4ghz radio flux versus the 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray flux .",
    "we also plot the data of all the other sources ( without first detection ) of the broad permitted line agn sample in table 2 of @xcite as a comparison . for these sources",
    "we take 0.45mjy , the typical 3 @xmath43 detection level of the first 20 cm survey @xcite , as an upper limit of radio emission .",
    "we see that for these upper limit sources no correlations exist in the flux - flux plot , while for sources in our sample the radio and x - ray fluxes are clearly correlated in each radio loudness bins . for radio - quiet sources and radio - loud sources in 3 different radio - loudness bins , the spearman correlation coefficients",
    "are 0.56 , 0.27 , 0.37 and 0.57 respectively .",
    "the corresponding power - law slope values for these different samples , derived from the ordinary least square ( ols ) bisector method @xcite , are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic correlation between the radio and x - ray emissions of agns really exist , though the distance effect can stretch out the luminosity relationship significantly and affect the intrinsic relation seriously in a flux - limited agn sample .",
    "in addition , from table 2 we can see that the correlations between the luminosities ( l@xmath0 or l@xmath1 ) and black hole masses still exist in the partial correlation test when taking the other luminosity ( l@xmath1 or l@xmath0 ) as the third variable . however , when considering the luminosities scaled with the eddington luminosity , we see that for the radio quiet sample the correlation with the black hole mass disappears .      based on the correlation analysis above",
    ", we finally fit the data in the form of : @xmath49 we also perform the fitting directly between the eddington luminosity scaled radio and x - ray luminosities for the radio quiet sample in the form of : @xmath50    we apply the ols multivariate regression method to the total sample and to the radio quiet and radio loud subsamples respectively .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] summarizes our ols bisector fitting results and lists the fitting parameters in equation ( 1 ) with errors in one - sigma confidence level and the dispersions ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the fitting result from merloni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is also listed for comparison .",
    "compared with the fundamental plane relation of @xcite , our results from the total sample of 115 sources and both the radio loud and radio quiet subsamples give a much smaller black hole mass dependence ( @xmath52 ) . and much larger radio ",
    "x - ray correlation slopes ( @xmath53 ) are found in the fittings of the total sample and the radio loud subsample when compared with the value of @xmath54 in @xcite . the radio  x - ray correlation slope ( @xmath55 ) in the result of radio quiet subsample is also larger than that in @xcite .",
    "the result of the eddington luminosity scaled luminosity fitting for radio quiet sources is : @xmath56 where errors are in one - sigma confidence level .",
    "[ res ] plots the fitting relations for radio quiet sources ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 6 ) ) plus all the data points ( including radio - loud sources ) in different radio loudness bins with the x coordinate represents the quantity calculated from these two equations for radio - quiet sources .",
    "the first thing we find out with our data is that our fundamental relationships are not sensitive to the black hole mass no matter the sources are radio loud or radio quiet ( see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "the correlation slope value @xmath52 is nearly zero within uncertainties for all the three fittings , which is different from what was found by @xcite .",
    "this is not surprise as our sample is uniform and includes only supermassive black holes whose masses are in a much narrower range compared to those in @xcite . in this case",
    "the black hole mass may not affect the relation significantly . in fig .",
    "[ lrxm ] we plot @xmath57 ratio versus black hole mass ( m ) in logarithm , which shows that the dependence of radio to x - ray luminosity ratio on black hole mass is also very weak .    secondly we get very different radio  x - ray correlations for the radio loud and radio quiet samples .",
    "the slope @xmath58 for our radio quiet sample is about 0.85 which is a little steeper than the result in @xcite , but still close to the value found in the hard state of gbhs ( gallo et al .",
    "2003 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "for the total sample and the radio loud subsample , the parameter @xmath58 is around 1.33 and 1.39 respectively .",
    "thus either a much different radiation mechanism or some additional effects must be taken into account for the radio loud sources .",
    "in addition , we also obtain a tight relation between the eddington luminosity scaled radio and x - ray luminosities for the radio quiet subsample with the correlation slope @xmath60 and a dispersion @xmath61 .",
    "previous studies on the black hole fundamental plane relation mainly concerned about the relations of black hole mass , hard x - ray luminosity ( eg .",
    "2 - 10kev ) , and radio luminosity at or above 5ghz @xcite .",
    "in this work , we use the 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray luminosity and 1.4ghz radio luminosity instead . if we assume that the x - ray and radio emission can be described as power laws with the typical spectral index in each band for all the sources",
    ", the corrections from hard to soft x - ray and from 5ghz to 1.4ghz should be linear and only change the constant item in the fundamental plan relation ( eq .",
    "however , the actual spectrum of individual sources in our sample is probably more complicated , especially in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the spectral parameters may change from one source to another according to different luminosity level or different dominated radiation mechanisms at different accretion rate .",
    "thus any nonlinear relations between the hard / soft x - ray luminosities or 5ghz/1.4ghz radio luminosities for sources in our sample will change the correlation slopes and result in different correlations in our fittings from those obtained in previous works . on the other hand , the small differences in the radio and x - ray spectral index for radio - quiet and radio - loud subsamples @xcite may also lead to some differences in the derived black hole fundamental plane .",
    "future detailed studies on the radio and x - ray spectral index for individual sources in our sample are expected to resolve this problem .    in this work we found very different black hole fundamental plane relations for radio loud and radio quiet broad line agns .",
    "although whether such a difference is intrinsic or not deserves further studies , our results on the fundamental plane relation is probably helpful to investigate the underlying black hole accretion physics and may be used to constrain the theoretical models .",
    "the fundamental plane relation with the x - ray emission dominated by the relativistic jet has been well discussed in literature .",
    "@xcite recently showed that the synchrotron emission from the scale invariant jet including the effect of radiation cooling can lead to a correlation of @xmath62 with typical scale invariant synchrotron jet parameters .",
    "similar conclusions were also obtained from studies on galactic black hole x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "our derived fundamental plane correlation slope for radio loud sample seems consistent with this jet dominate x - ray model as well",
    ".    however , for radio loud agns the doppler beaming effect from the relativistic jet should also be important .",
    "doppler beaming can increase the jet intrinsic power by a factor of @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the beaming factor and @xmath65 is the intrinsic power - law spectra index , i.e. @xmath66 , @xcite ) and may lead to a spurious observed correlation .",
    "there are two situations needed to be discussed when thinking about the beaming effect .",
    "one is that both the radio and x - ray fluxes are dominated by jet emission and they will be affected by the relativistic beaming to different levels according to the spectral index in different band .",
    "the other is that only the radio emission is from the jet and beamed while the x - ray emission is dominated by the accretion flow . @xcite",
    "have studied the low - power accretion black hole systems where the radio and x - ray emissions are both jet dominated .",
    "they used a sample including both the stellar black hole systems and agns , and found that the scaling relation between radio and x - ray emissions is only slightly dependent on the beaming factors in the form of shifting along the fitted correlation line .",
    "however , such a jet dominated circumstance only exists in the low state of black hole systems @xcite and is thus possibly not the case for our sample . in our case for broad line agns , probably only the radio emission is beamed .",
    "therefore , for agns with different radio - loudness this extra effect of relativistic beaming will cause parallel shifts from the intrinsic fundamental plane , and thus lead to a steeper correlation slope in the observed correlation .",
    "we noticed that the beaming factor is hard to be measured directly for large sample of agns , so we use the radio loudness as a possible indicator of it . in fig .",
    "[ rbin ] and fig .",
    "[ res ] all radio loud sources are shown in a parallel distribution according to different radio loudness bins , which indicates the possibility that all of these sources may obey the same correlation as that of the radio quiet sources but it is shifted by a different level according to different radio loudness . if we take the radio quiet fundamental plane relation as an intrinsic one for all agns with high accretion rate , the difference ( @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) between the observed radio luminosity and that derived from the radio quiet fundamental plane can be calculated . in fig .",
    "[ detr ] we plot @xmath67 and @xmath69 versus radio loudness and tight correlations are found . as shown in this plot",
    ", the differences between the observed and estimated radio luminosity can be different in more than 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is not impossible for the extremely radio loud sources with a beaming factor greater than 10 .",
    "also the difference between the observed and calculated radio luminosities are tightly correlated with the radio loudness .",
    "table  [ table4 ] lists the partial kendall s @xmath42 correlation coefficient between @xmath67 , @xmath70 and logarithm radio loudness when taking the logarithm observed radio luminosity as the third variable .",
    "the test shows that the correlation still exists when the effects of radio luminosity are excluded .",
    "therefore we think that the observed fundamental plane for radio loud agns is unreliable unless the beaming effect can be removed .    when considering the fundamental plane for radio quiet sources only , the underlying physical mechanism is not very clear as well .",
    "we compared our results with the available accretion flow models discussed in @xcite with corresponding parameters listed in table 3 of their paper .",
    "as the rosat observations are in the soft x - ray band , we also investigated the model of multicolour thermal emission from the inner part of a standard thin disk @xcite .",
    "moreover , the jet dominated situation with radiation cooling effect is also considered .",
    "at last we found that our fitting result can be marginally matched when the magnetic field dependence on black hole mass and accretion rate in the form of @xmath71 and the x - ray luminosity has a non - linear dependence on accretion rate with a power - law index around 2 .",
    "such parameters can be satisfied in the radiatively inefficient accretion flow models @xcite .",
    "similar conclusion was also found in @xcite . however , there is no evidence that the sources with radiatively inefficient accretion flow occupy a large percentage in our sample when considering the x - ray to eddington luminosity ratio range ( @xmath72 to 1 , see the @xmath73 histogram in fig .",
    "[ six ] ) .",
    "we noticed that the emission in soft x - ray band is complex and may come from different radiation mechanisms @xcite including the multicolor thermal emission from the inner part of an optically thick disk , inverse compton emission , and free - free emission in the hot corona .",
    "so more analyses on the x - ray and radio spectra as well as accretion disk model studies are needed for obtaining more accurate physical explanations of such a fundamental plane relation .",
    "with a uniform broad line agn sample we have studied the fundamental plane relation in black hole accretion systems . compared to previous works , we found that our fundamental plane relation has a much weaker dependence on the black hole mass .",
    "a very tight relation is also found between the eddington luminosity scaled x - ray and radio luminosities for radio quiet sources .",
    "the non - linear dependence of radio luminosity on x - ray luminosity is different for radio loud and radio quiet agns .",
    "we attribute this to the relativistic jet in radio - loud agns .",
    "especially the doppler beaming effect from a relativistic jet can increase the intrinsic radio emission significantly and lead to a steeper slope of the fundamental plan relation . the derived fundamental plane relation for",
    "radio - quiet sources should better reflect the intrinsic physical correlations .",
    "however , the soft x - ray emission mechanisms of agns are complex and more reliable theoretical explanations are expected to be obtained only after further detailed spectral studies in soft x - ray and radio band on the individual agns in our sample can be done .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that our black hole fundamental plane relation is derived from a flux - limited sample consisting of 115 broad line agns .",
    "obviously more future studies with larger and better samples are needed to confirm our result .",

    "<S> we derived the black hole fundamental plane relationship among the 1.4ghz radio luminosity ( l@xmath0 ) , 0.1 - 2.4kev x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath1 ) , and black hole mass ( m ) from a uniform broad line sdss agn sample including both radio loud and radio quiet x - ray emitting sources . </S>",
    "<S> we found in our sample that the fundamental plane relation has a very weak dependence on the black hole mass , and a tight correlation also exists between the eddington luminosity scaled x - ray and radio luminosities for the radio quiet subsample . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we noticed that the radio quiet and radio loud agns have different power - law slopes in the radio  x - ray non - linear relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the radio loud sample displays a slope of 1.39 , which seems consistent with the jet dominated x - ray model . </S>",
    "<S> however , it may also be partly due to the relativistic beaming effect . for radio quiet sample the slope of the radio  x - ray relationship is about 0.85 , which is possibly consistent with the theoretical prediction from the accretion flow dominated x - ray model . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the reason why our derived relationship is different from some previous works and expect the future spectral studies in radio and x - ray bands on individual sources in our sample to confirm our result . </S>"
