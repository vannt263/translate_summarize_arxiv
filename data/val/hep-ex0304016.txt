    "-20pt the earth provides an effective shield against the muon component of cosmic ray showers for overburdens exceeding 14,000 meters - water - equivalent ( mwe ) . consequently , near the horizontal direction ( @xmath0 ) at the site of the soudan  2 detector ( vertical depth 2090 mwe ) , the muon flux is comprised almost entirely of @xmath5 initiated by charged current interactions of atmospheric muon neutrinos in the rock surrounding the detector .",
    "in addition , astrophysical neutrino sources may contribute to the ( horizontal ) muon flux .",
    "in particular , a high energy ( @xmath6 5 tev ) contribution may arise as the result of neutrinos which originate within astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agns)@xcite .",
    "active galaxies are those with extreme variations in brightness corresponding to abnormal emission of large amounts of energy at optical and/or radio wavelengths . colliding and exploding",
    "galaxies also fall into this category .",
    "the nuclei of these galaxies may produce both neutral and charged particles .",
    "most of the particles either decay or are absorbed before they can escape the galaxy , leaving only photons and neutrinos to be detected on earth .",
    "several models predict substantial high - energy neutrino production from agns@xcite , however there is a theoretical limit which conflicts with many of these models@xcite .",
    "agns may collectively give rise to a diffuse neutrino flux , or they may be detectable as individual point sources .",
    "gamma ray burst sources have also been proposed as another possible diffuse source of high energy neutrinos@xcite .    charged current interactions of multi - tev muon neutrinos ( @xmath7 ) in the rock surrounding the soudan",
    "2 detector can be expected to give rise to tev muons at the detector .",
    "muons with these large energies will very frequently exhibit catastrophic energy loss by bremsstrahlung or pair production as they traverse the tracking calorimeter .",
    "this is highly improbable for muons ( @xmath8gev at the detector ) initiated by atmospheric neutrino reactions in the surrounding rock .",
    "thus it is possible to measure the rate of high energy agn neutrinos .    in this paper",
    "we report a measurement of the horizontal muon flux of @xmath2@xmath3sr@xmath4s@xmath4 and a negative search for high energy muons from agns .",
    "-20pt    r9.2 cm    the detector is located approximately 700  m below the earth s surface in an historic iron mine in soudan , minnesota , usa . a photograph is shown is figure [ fig : detector ] .",
    "the central detector is an iron sampling calorimeter using drift tubes filled with 85% ar - 15% co@xmath9 gas as the active medium .",
    "the detector is made of 224 modules with dimensions of @xmath10m@xmath11 .",
    "each module has a mass of @xmath12 t. the modules are stacked 2 high for a total height of 5.4  m , and 8 wide for a width of 8  m. the average density is @xmath13g / cm@xmath11 .",
    "the drift tubes are oriented along the north - south direction and are operated in proportional mode .",
    "each end of the tubes is read out by an anode wire and a cathode pad which establish the _ x _ ( east - west ) and _ y _ coordinates of the hits . off line ,",
    "hits are matched in each half tube , using pulse height to match the cathode and anode pulses .",
    "the _ z _ ( north - south ) position of the hit is determined by correlating the drift times .",
    "the ceiling , floor , and walls of the detector hall are covered with an active shield consisting of a two layer aluminum proportional tube array .",
    "the shield array resolves charged particle crossings (  hits \" ) to within four microseconds and within rectangular surfaces of 10 cm @xmath15 5 m. for most soudan  2 analyses , the shield is used to veto events in the main detector which were initiated by particles interacting in the surrounding rock .",
    "use of coincident in - time shield hits in the present analysis is described in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "the trigger for recording events requires a multiplicity of seven anode pulses or eight cathode pulses in blocks of 16 contiguous readout channels . for",
    "long muon tracks this trigger is fully efficient .    a near horizontal muon data event which is ( presumably ) neutrino - induced is shown in figure [ fig : event ] .",
    "this example is the longest horizontal muon track that was found , with a length of 1464 cm and 149 tube crossings used in the fit .",
    "the zenith ( azimuth ) angle of this track is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "two shield hits can be seen in the top and front views .",
    "the construction and performance of the tracking calorimeter are extensively described in reference @xcite . of particular interest to this analysis , the single track angular resolution has been measured using the moon shadow@xcite to be ( 0.3@xmath18 @xmath15 @xmath19 ) and the electromagnetic energy resolution determined by counting tube crossings has been measured in the isis test beam@xcite to be @xmath20 where e is given in gev and the second term reflects the saturation of the number of hits .",
    "-20pt figure [ fig : crouch ] shows the vertical muon intensity underground as a function of depth in standard rock , as compiled by crouch@xcite and subsequently updated by the particle data group@xcite .",
    "two distinct components are apparent in the fitted curve , which consists of a double exponential plus a constant term .",
    "the atmospheric muon rate is observed to fall sharply with slant depth , so that the flatter spectrum of neutrino - induced muons only becomes visible for slant depths greater than 14  kmwe . for angles",
    "@xmath21 with respect to the vertical ( zenith angle ) , the slant depth increases approximately as @xmath22 , but depends in detail on both the surface terrain and the rock density and composition .",
    "based on the vertical muon spectrum and the calculation of the average slant depth at soudan  2 as shown in figure  [ fig : crouch ] , we can select a sample of neutrino induced muons by making a cut on the zenith angle near 82@xmath23 . since the event timing resolution is about 100 ns , it is not possible to ascertain whether a muon is upward- or downward - going .",
    "there is thus a two - fold ambiguity in the direction for each measured track and @xmath21 is defined to be @xmath24 .",
    "are projected onto the surface .",
    "the distance between soudan and two harbors , mn , is 97  km . ]",
    "calculation of the slant depth requires knowledge of both the rock density and the surface terrain .",
    "differences between standard rock ( @xmath25g / cm@xmath11 ) and soudan rock ( 3.00  g/@xmath26g / cm@xmath11 ) must be taken into account .",
    "the topology above and surrounding the soudan site is shown in figure [ fig : merge]@xcite .",
    "the geology of the region is such that the iron deposits are almost vertical , so that the most vertical zenith angles correspond to the highest average density .",
    "the majority of the rock is greenstone composed of silicon dioxide ( sio@xmath9 ) and aluminum oxide ( al@xmath9o@xmath9).@xcite based on soudan rock effective parameters , a depth of 14 kmwe in standard rock corresponds to 13.2 kmwe in soudan rock.@xcite    due to the uneven surface terrain , the slant depth was calculated for each track individually . observed fluxes of cosmic ray induced muons with @xmath27 have been used to determine the zenith angle dependence of the rock density@xcite . by considering the azimuthal variation in the slant depth ,",
    "we infer that systematic uncertainties in the atmospheric muon flux due to incomplete knowledge of the rock density are on the order of 10% .    upon inclusion of the terrain information , a more refined estimation of the slant depth as a function of zenith angle",
    "is obtained , as indicated in figure [ fig : s2_slantdepth ] .",
    "the solid curve in that figure was made assuming a spherical earth .",

    "-20pt there were approximately @xmath31 triggered events in the soudan  2 detector in the data set considered for this analysis . about half of these were due to cosmic ray muons , and half due to radioactivity in different parts of the detector which satisfied the trigger due to multiplexing .",
    "these events were processed using a pattern recognition filter code which identifies muon tracks and discriminates against unphysical background from noise@xcite .",
    "event processing took place in three stages .",
    "runs were processed by the mine computer soon after the runs were complete , and sorted into a number of output streams , one of which was a file consisting of events which included a track with a zenith angle greater than 60 degrees .",
    "those files were then subjected to a filter program described below which identified horizontal muon candidates with a zenith angle greater than 78 degrees . there were 4458 events from the output of that filter which were scanned .",
    "the filter program used five cuts which were applied to define a  horizontal muon \" sample as listed in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "tracks were required to have end points consistent with a particle entering and leaving the detector .",
    "acceptable track ends were required to 1 ) lie outside the fiducial volume which is 50 cm from the edge of the main detector , or 2 ) lie on a module boundary inside of the main detector and 3 ) point to a coincident shield hit or 4 ) point to a portion of the shield where a shield module did not exist .",
    "the azimuth cut rejected noisy events reconstructed parallel to the axes of the detector .",
    "the zenith cut defined the sample of horizontal muons .",
    "the track length cut minimized short tracks such as pions that originated from nuclear interactions within the rock nearby and also low energy cosmic ray muons which had undergone large multiple coulomb scattering .",
    "r9.0 cm    the anode - width cut rejected events that were primarily along one anode wire .",
    "these were actually along the north - south direction , but were often mis - reconstructed .",
    "the efficiency of these cuts for monte carlo muons generated isotropically with zenith angles exceeding 82 degrees is 0.56 @xmath32 0.01 as given in table  [ tab : efficiency ] .",
    "note that both the trigger and reconstruction efficiency are lower near zenith angles of 90 degrees .",
    "the pattern recognition software found single horizontal muon tracks , but it also kept a variety of background events .",
    "most background events contained short horizontal tracks accompanied by other activity in the detector .",
    "physicist scanning of all tracks greater than 78@xmath18 was done to verify the track fits and to eliminate obvious backgrounds .",
    "common backgrounds were due to certain patterns of electronic noise , vertical muons undergoing large radiative stochastic losses , multiple muons , and neutrino interactions within the detector .",
    "tracks with visible multiple scattering ( greater than 2 degrees ) or with in - time shield hits that were not due to a horizontal muon were also rejected .",
    "all events were subjected to two independent scans and residual discrepancies were rescanned .",
    "the uncorrelated scan inefficiency as determined from the double scan was less than 1% .",
    "the monte carlo which was used for the efficiency calculation only generated high energy ( 100 gev ) muons .",
    "this fails to take into account neutrino induced muons with lower energies in the detector which might fail the multiple scattering cut applied during scanning .",
    "an independent calculation that took into account the neutrino induced muon energy distribution at the detector gave the result that 5% @xmath32 5% of the events should undergo multiple scattering by more than 2 degrees in the detector , the criterion used during scanning .",
    "we therefore used a scan efficiency of 95% for the atmospheric neutrino flux calculation . note that this inefficiency does not apply to the agn @xmath33 search in the next section .",
    ".survival rates of 2000 monte carlo muons incident nearly horizontal on the soudan  2 detector .",

    "the limits are lower for higher energy cut - offs because of the higher probability of detecting a large energy loss .",

    "the frejus experiment used two methods to set a limit on the flux of high energy neutrinos@xcite .",
    "one method extrapolated a fit to the atmospheric neutrino energy spectrum obtained previously@xcite . since that fit assumed that one spectral index fit all of their data , using it to deduce a limit for muons arising from a different energy distribution may bias that limit toward small values .",
    "the limit was quoted as @xmath37tev@xmath38gev@xmath4@xmath3s@xmath4sr@xmath4 . with their second method ,",
    "frejus used the absence of muons with large energy loss to constrain the normalization of a number of specific models of the high energy neutrino flux@xcite .",
    "the macro experiment@xcite conducted an agn search and found 2 candidate events with background of 1.1 expected .",
    "they set an upper limit on the muon flux from diffuse neutrinos of @xmath39@xmath3s@xmath4sr@xmath4 .",
    "their efficiency was highest for upward - going muons and lowest for horizontal muons .",
    "the amanda neutrino telescope , located in the ice near the south pole , has set a limit based on an assumed diffuse @xmath40 spectrum of @xmath41@xmath3s@xmath4sr@xmath4gev@xmath4@xcite    as another test for an extraterrestrial component in the horizontal muon events , we have examined them for evidence of point sources .",
