    "solitons are important ingredients of models in high energy physics . apart from being responsible for various non - perturbative quantum phenomena ,",
    "solitons are interesting in themselves , since they can be viewed as field theoretic realizations of elementary particles .",
    "it is from this viewpoint that solitons were originally introduced into physics in the context of the skyrme model  as models of hadrons .",
    "the subsequent developments have revealed soliton solutions in many other non - linear field theories in minkowski space , such as monopoles , vortices , sphalerons , q - balls , etc .",
    "these solutions describe localized , particle - like objects with finite energy .",
    "their spectra of energy and charge are typically discrete . in addition , these solutions are regular everywhere , a property which is especially appealing .",
    "so far , however , solitons have been lacking one important feature of elementary particles : the intrinsic angular momentum @xmath2 , which is zero for all known classical solutions .",
    "it is sensible to ask whether _ stationary _ rotating generalizations for the known static soliton solutions exist .",
    "more precisely , one is interested in finite energy , globally regular , non - radiating solutions for which the spatial integral of the @xmath3 component of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 is non - vanishing . in this definition",
    "the condition of stationarity ( absence of radiation ) is important .",
    "indeed , it is always possible to construct a field configuration such that @xmath5 at the initial moment of time .",
    "physically this would correspond to exciting the soliton to give it an angular momentum ) does not vanish , as for instance ` rotating ' skyrmions @xcite , knots @xcite , etc .",
    "these configurations , however , are not solutions of the equations of motion , and at best they can be viewed as the initial values for the dynamical evolution problem . ] . however ,",
    "when the time evolution starts , the received excitation will be most probably immediately radiated away , leaving behind a non - rotating object .",
    "when talking about rotating solitons , it also seems sensible to distinguish between two types of rotation : _ spinning _ and _ orbiting_. _ spinning _ is associated with the intrinsic angular momentum , in analogy with the quantum - mechanical spin .",
    "classical spin excitations , if they exist , should live in the one - soliton sector because they are excitations of an individual object .",
    "one expects that the corresponding angular momentum will assume only discrete values .",
    "solutions describing spinning solitons in minkowski space in @xmath0 dimensions are not known .",
    "for example , it is not known whether the t hooft - polyakov monopoles can be given classical spin .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that , at the _ perturbative _ level , monopoles do not admit stationary rotational excitations in the one - monopole sector @xcite .",
    "this means that monopoles can not rotate _ slowly _ , with @xmath6 .",
    "monopoles with finite ( discrete ) values of @xmath2 are not yet excluded . however , to decide whether such solutions exist requires to go beyond perturbation theory and solving the complete coupled system of the yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) partial differential equations ( pdes ) , which is an exceedingly difficult task .    on the other hand",
    ", one can consider relative _",
    "orbital _ motions in composite many - soliton systems .",
    "for example , one can imagine a rotating soliton - antisoliton pair balanced against mutual attraction by the centrifugal force .",
    "the spectrum of the angular momentum is then expected to be continuous .",
    "solutions describing such orbiting solitons can actually be constructed . in the case of monopoles , for instance",
    ", there exist @xcite solitonic solutions of the ymh field equations with vanishing higgs potential in the sector with zero monopole charge .",
    "such static , purely magnetic solutions have been explicitly constructed in @xcite ; they describe monopole - antimonopole pairs balanced by a repulsive force of topological nature .",
    "now , there is a simple way to add angular momentum to these solutions @xcite by using the global symmetry of the field equations which mixes the higgs field @xmath7 and the electric potential @xmath8 : @xmath9 applying this transformation with an arbitrary @xmath10 leads to solutions with an electric field .",
    "it is important to note that this also changes the angular momentum to @xmath11 @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason one can not use this method to produce spinning monopoles , because non - bps solutions with finite energy and unit topological charge are not known @xcite . ]",
    "( in fact @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electric charge @xcite ) .",
    "these new solutions can be interpreted as describing the system of a monopole and antimonopole rotating around their common center of mass .",
    "another example of systems which could be classified as orbiting solitons are rotating vortex loops . in certain models there exist vortices with stationary currents along them ; ` superconducting vortices ' .",
    "one can argue @xcite that taking a finite piece of such a vortex , bending and closing it to form a loop , finally adding a momentum along the loop , leads to an object ( vorton ) described by a stationary solution of the equations of motion .",
    "the angular momentum in this case is associated with the macroscopic circulation of the current along the loop .",
    "this type of motion could be naturally classified as orbital rotation .    on the other hand",
    ", one can also consider the rotation of a straight vortex _ along _ its symmetry axis .",
    "this would correspond more closely to the notion of an intrinsic spinning rotation .",
    "although one can show that for the nielsen - olesen vortex such spinning excitations do not exist , they can actually exist in other models @xcite .",
    "however , this only gives spinning solitons in @xmath1 dimensions , while their @xmath0 dimensional analogs will have infinite energy due to the infinite length of the vortex .    in summary",
    ", we are not aware of any spinning solitons in minkowski space in @xmath0 dimensions . at the same time , such solutions are known in curved space . indeed , there are many rotating solutions in general relativity . in the pure gravity case",
    "they comprise the family of kerr - newman black holes .",
    "these are very similar to solitons , but they are not globally regular and contain a curvature singularity .",
    "there are also globally regular rotating solutions @xcite , but these require a source of a non - field theoretic origin .",
    "interestingly , there exist two explicit examples of gravitating spinning solitons in pure field systems .    the first example is provided by rotating boson stars @xcite .",
    "these are solutions for a gravity - coupled massive complex scalar field with harmonic dependence on time and on the azimuthal angle , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 integer .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is time - independent , and the einstein equations together with the klein - gordon equation for @xmath16 admit globally regular , stationary particle - like solutions @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum is quantized as @xmath17 .",
    "the solutions with @xmath18 can be regarded as spinning excitations of the fundamental static , spherically symmetric solutions with @xmath19 .",
    "this example is instructive in the sense that it is clear ` what rotates ' : this is the phase @xmath20 . in this connection",
    "it is worth noting that the very notion of rotation in pure field systems is very different from that for ordinary rigid bodies .",
    "indeed , it is meaningless to say that a given element of volume of a field system actually ` performs revolutions ' around a given axis .",
    "of course , one can imagine a solitonic object with a field perturbation running around it .",
    "however , such a moving perturbation will be most probably immediately radiated away .",
    "the example of boson stars thus shows that one can nevertheless have a rotating phase which is not radiated away .    in stationary rotating systems without explicit time dependence the rotation",
    "will rather be associated with certain non - linear superpositions of the multipole moments of the fields .",
    "for example , in systems with vector fields , angular momentum may be present due to a non - vanishing integral involving the poynting vector , @xmath21 a stationary , globally regular configuration for which this integral is non - zero would correspond to a rotating soliton .",
    "it is possible that such solutions could exist for the su(2 ) yang - mills fields coupled to gravity .",
    "the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) field equations admit globally regular , particle like solutions @xcite .",
    "these gravitating eym particles are static , spherically symmetric and neutral ( their purely magnetic gauge field strength decays asymptotically as @xmath22 ) .",
    "now , for these solutions one can _ perturbatively _ construct stationary , globally regular , axially - symmetric , slowly rotating generalizations @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , their spectrum of @xmath2 is _ continuous _ , as if they were composite objects , which is presumably due to the special feature of the field system consisting of only _ massless _ physical fields .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear at the moment whether these perturbative solutions exist also at the non - perturbative level  the analysis of @xcite indicates the opposite .",
    "it is however still possible that the solitons exist , but within a more general ansatz than that considered in @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "spinning solitons have been found only in curved space .",
    "it is then sensible to ask if spinning solitons without gravity exist at all . in principle",
    ", it is not excluded that only gravity can support the relevant rotational degrees of freedom . in order to rule out this logical possibility ,",
    "we have undertaken an attempt to construct spinning solitons in flat space .",
    "the solitons we have chosen to ` rotate ' are q - balls @xcite .",
    "these are solutions for a complex scalar field with a non - renormalizable self - interaction arising in some effective field theories .",
    "these solutions circumvent the standard derrick - type argument due to having a time - dependent phase for the scalar field . in this sense",
    "they are somewhat similar to the boson stars . in the simplest spherically symmetric case",
    "the fundamental q - ball solution was described by coleman @xcite .",
    "dynamical properties of these objects have been studied in @xcite .",
    "q - balls also appear in supersymmetric generalizations of the standard model , where one finds leptonic and baryonic q - balls @xcite which may be responsible for the generation of baryon number or may be regarded as candidates for dark matter @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we first recall the properties of the fundamental spherically symmetric q - balls .",
    "in addition , we present an infinite family of their radial excitations which have not been reported in the literature before . we then turn to rotating solutions and first consider them in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions , where the problem reduces to an ordinary differential equation .",
    "finally we consider the full problem in @xmath0 dimensions and explicitly construct solutions with angular momentum . to our knowledge , our analysis gives the first explicit example of spinning solitons in flat space .",
    "let us consider a theory of a complex scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions defined by the lagrangian @xmath23 it is assumed that the potential @xmath24 has its global minimum at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , while @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the potential must fulfill a particular inequality ( eq.([cond3 ] ) ) which will be discussed below .",

    "since @xmath8 should depend on time for @xmath13 to be non - vanishing , one assumes that @xmath8 has a harmonic time dependence . in the spherically symmetric case , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is real",
    "the potential @xmath34 and the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 being the spacetime metric ) do not depend on time .",
    "the energy distribution is therefore stationary , and the total energy is @xmath37 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath38 .",

    "resolving these conditions determines a globally regular solution in the interval @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , in this way an infinite discrete family of globally regular solutions parametrized by the number @xmath73 of nodes of @xmath48 is obtained .",

    "[ fig2 ] , with the total effective energy @xmath43 being equal to its potential energy .",
    "then it moves to the right , dissipating some of its energy along its way . for @xmath64",

    "this can be achieved by fine - tuning the initial position of the particle , @xmath69 . if @xmath76 , the effective energy of the particle will always be _ negative _ , and therefore it will not be able to end up in a configuration with zero energy .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath69 is such that the particle starts very close to the absolute maximum of @xmath75 , then it will stay there for a long ` time ' @xmath38 , during which period the dissipation term in ( [ radeom2 ] ) , which is @xmath77 , will become very small . as a result , when the particle will eventually start moving , its energy will be too large , and so it will ` overshoot ' the position with zero energy . by continuity , there is a value @xmath69 for which the total effective energy ( the right hand side in ( [ radeom2 ] ) ) is exactly zero for @xmath64 , and so the particle will travel from @xmath78 to @xmath79 @xcite .    next , one can fine - tune @xmath69 such that the initial energy @xmath80 is slightly too large , so that the particle first overshoots the @xmath81 position , but then it hits the barrier from the other side , bounces back and dissipates just enough energy to finally arrive at @xmath81 with zero energy .",
    "this will give a solution with one node of @xmath33 in the interval @xmath72 . similarly one can obtain solutions with @xmath82 .",
