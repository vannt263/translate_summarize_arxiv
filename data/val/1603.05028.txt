    "poisson vertex algebras ( pva ) arise as the quasi - classical limit of a family of vertex algebras @xcite in the same way as poisson algebras arise as the quasi - classical limit of a family of associative algebras .",
    "note also that a pva is a local counterpart of a coisson ( = chiral poisson ) algebra defined in @xcite .",
    "moreover , a pva can be obtained as a formal fourier transform of a local poisson bracket @xcite , which plays an important role in the theory of infinite - dimensional integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "in fact , as demonstrated in @xcite , the language of @xmath0-brackets @xcite in the framework of poisson vertex algebras is often more convenient and transparent than the equivalent languages of local poisson brackets , used in the book @xcite , or of hamiltonian operators , used in the book @xcite ( and references therein ) .    hence , the theory of pva has been extensively used in order to get a better understanding of generalized drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies for classical affine @xmath1-algebras @xcite , adler - gelfand - dickey hierarchies @xcite and , more generally , lax type integrable hamiltonian equations @xcite , and the lenard - magri scheme of integrability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the notion of a pva has been extended in @xcite to deal with hamiltonian operators , or , equivalently , local poisson brackets , for multidimensional systems of pdes ( namely , pdes for functions depending on several spatial variables ) .",
    "the notion of multidimensional pva has been used for studying the theory of symmetries and deformations of the so - called poisson brackets of hydrodynamic type @xcite , as well as for the local nonlinear brackets associated with 2d euler s equation @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable accomplishments of the theory of pva has been the derivation of an explicit formula for the bi - hamiltonian structure underlying classical @xmath1-algebras @xcite .",
    "classical affine @xmath1-algebras are associated to a pair @xmath2 consisting of a simple lie algebra @xmath3 and a nilpotent element @xmath4 . for a principal nilpotent element @xmath4 , they appeared in the seminal paper by drinfeld and sokolov @xcite .",
    "they were introduced as poisson algebras of functions on an infinite dimensional poisson manifold , and they were used to study kdv - type integrable bi - hamiltonian hierarchies of pde s , nowadays known as drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies .",
    "subsequently , in the 90 s , there was an extensive literature extending the drinfeld - sokolov construction of classical @xmath1-algebras and the corresponding generalized drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies to other nilpotent elements , @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , classical affine @xmath1-algebras were described as pvas .",
    "the powerful tool of the language of @xmath0-bracket has been then used to get an explicit formula for the bi - hamiltonian structure describing them and to give a rigorous definition , and to compute explicitly , generalized drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies @xcite .",
    "these results may find interesting applications in studying the relations of drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies with kac - wakimoto hierarchies @xcite and computation of the corresponding tau - functions , and in the problem of quantization of classical integrable systems @xcite and applications to cft .",
    "the most powerful tool in the pva theory is the so - called master formula .",
    "it allows to rephrase the relevant questions in the theory of infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems in terms of the @xmath0-bracket language , thus providing a completely algebraic computational technique , which replaces all the manipulations used in @xcite in the setting of the formal calculus of variations .",
    "note that , in the @xmath0-bracket language the computations are not necessarily hard to perform by hand , but their numbers increase dramatically with the growing number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the package _ masterpva _ and its generalization to the multidimensional case _",
    "masterpvamulti _ have been written to exploit a computer algebra system , like mathematica , to automatically compute the master formula for pva .",
    "the choice of mathematica is motivated by the pre - existing package _ lambda _ , by j.",
    "ekstrand @xcite , aimed to compute operator product expansions in conformal field theory using the @xmath0-bracket language within the framework of vertex algebras @xcite .",
    "these packages have been used in @xcite  with some preliminary results published in @xcite  in order to compute up to second dispersive order the casimir functions , the symmetries and the compatible deformations of the bidimensional poisson brackets of hydrodynamic type .",
    "they have been proved effective also when working with scalar structures , whenever explicit computations are needed @xcite .",
    "the mathematica package _ walg _ provides the implementation of the results about the structure theory of classical affine @xmath1-algebras obtained in @xcite .",
    "it can be used to compute all @xmath0-brackets between generators of the classical affine @xmath1-algebras @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is a simple lie algebra of type @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath4 is an arbitrary nilpotent element .",
    "thus we can obtain explicit expressions for the generalized drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies and their bi - hamiltonian structure by combining the programs _ walg _ and _",

    "[ sec : pva ] we review the definition of pva following @xcite and its multidimensional generalization given in @xcite . in particular",
    "we introduce the notion of an algebra of differential functions and the master formula used to perform @xmath0-brackets computations on it , and we show that a pva is equivalent to the notion of an hamiltonian operator ( differently from @xcite we call this hamiltonian operator a poisson structure ) .",
