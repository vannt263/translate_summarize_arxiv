    "the well - known measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation by wmap @xcite , in combination with the supernovae type ia observations @xcite , imply that the evolution of the universe is dominated by dark energy , and a state parameter that is strongly constrained . among the most popular scenarios to explain the data ,",
    "is to assume the existence of an inflationary universe with a very small cosmological constant @xmath3 . in principle ,",
    "possible contributions to dark energy can also be provided from topological defects which are produced at phase transitions in the universe @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility , for instance , would have been that , such contributions are provided by domain walls @xcite associated with the breaking of discrete symmetries ( which arise commonly in a wide class of particle physics models ) .",
    "yet another possibility is that there is no discrete symmetry at all .",
    "even then , there could be nearby minima separated by a potential barrier , with initial conditions that result in both minima getting populated with non - zero probabilities . in this case",
    "we do not have an exact domain wall configuration , but ( as will become more obvious later ) it still makes sense to talk about approximate domain walls that interpolate , in a broader sense , between basins of attraction of nearby local minima . and , in fact , we will show that the dynamics and evolution of the network of inhomogeneities is very similar in both situations - with exact and approximate domain walls . as a specific example of the behaviour of the second type we take run - away potentials which appear in models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking , and play an important role in modern attempts at non - perturbative supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilisation .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out by dine @xcite , that spatially inhomogeneous field configurations may evolve differently in the expanding robertson - walker background than the homeogeneous mode .",
    "the inhomogeneities may help to stabilise the moduli ( such as the dilaton or radion ) at shallow but finite minima , thus avoiding the steinhardt ",
    "brustein @xcite and buchmller @xcite effects . at the same time , the energy density inhomogeneities of such configurations may contribute to the shape of the power spectrum of cmbr . in the case of tev scale supersymmetry",
    "breaking this contribution would be unobservable , but the issue of finding the right vacuum remains a valid question independently of the mass scale associated with a run - away potential .",
    "there are three main problems in cosmological scenarios that involve a significant abundabce of domain walls :    \\(i ) domain walls that could potentially contribute to dark energy , generally predict an equation of state with @xmath4 , which would be ruled out from the commonly quoted upper bound @xmath5 at @xmath6 c.l .",
    "\\(ii ) domain walls that could enhance the cold dark matter spectrum are in general associated with unacceptably large fluctuations of the cmbr ( cosmic microwave background radiation ) , for the range of parameters that would have been relevant for the formation of structure . for a horizon - size bubble at a redshift @xmath7 , with surface energy @xmath8 ,",
    "the generated anisotropies are given by @xmath9    \\(iii ) domain walls in the simplest class of models that evade problem ( ii ) , do not stay around suffiently , in order to produce density fluctuations that can sufficiently grow to the observed structures @xcite .",
    "the first problem has in fact been addressed in a very convincing way in @xcite , where the assumptions made in the choice of priors of the data analysis have been questioned .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that , for lower values of the hubble parameter ( @xmath10 , as indicated by sunyaev - zeldovich and time delays for gravitational lensing observations ) , and for higher values of the matter density ( @xmath11 , in agreement with measurements of the temperature - luminosity relation of distant clusters observed with the xmm - newton satellite ) , domain walls in an inflationary universe can provide a good fit to the wmap data .    in previous papers @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed and tested two main frameworks that may naturally arise in standard model extensions for which domain walls can lead to the formation of structure , enhancing the standard cold dark matter spectrum in an inflationary universe , while still be compatible with cmbr .",
    "these are the following :    \\a ) schemes where the walls are unstable , due to a non - degeneracy of the minima of the potential ( as appears naturally in a wide class of superstring models @xcite ) . for a large range of possible parameters ,",
    "the walls are expected to annihilate before recombination . in this way , although structure can be generated and subsequently grow in consistency with the observations , no unacceptable distortions to the cosmic microwave background radiation are produced .",
    "\\b ) a second possibility is that , if one of the minima of the potential of the scalar field is favoured , then a biased phase transition occurs . as a first step , we showed why such a bias may be expected in post - inflationary , out - of - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , if the interactions of a field are _ very weak _ , this will not be confined at the top of its potential , but will in fact be centered around a classical value that will be closer to one of the minima of the potential .",
    "quantum fluctuations will move it , but , nevertheless , the bias ( offset ) will remain . then",
    ", percolation theory indicates that there is a range of natural initial conditions for which walls of finite size ( and not of horizon size ) are produced inside a sea of the dominant vacuum . while not very accurate , percolation theory allowed us to formulate a qualitative picture of the spatial distribution of the wall - driven overdensities in a post - inflationary universe , and to account for the whole range of large scale structure observations . in addition , by studying wall - driven fluctuations at small scales , it has been possible to reproduce the observed distribution of quasars @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , elaborate numerical simulations seemed to indicate that despite the biasing of the minima , the walls either disappear too fast , or stay around for too long @xcite , implying that they have to be very soft if they are not to lead to unacceptable distortions of the microwave background radiation . in this work",
    ", we will give specific examples where this need not be the case , firstly in biased double well potentials with non - degenerate minima and secondly , for the runaway potentials that can be expected in a wide class of supersymmetry breaking models , based on gaugino condensates .",
    "this complements the literature on the subject and raises additional possibilities to those that have been considered in the recent years ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "an elaborate numerical study of the dynamics of domain wall networks in the case of a scalar field whose potential has two degenerate minima that occur with the same probability , has been provided by press , ryden and spergel , @xcite , who showed that such networks would rapidly evolve into long domain walls stretching across the universe whose surface area , and , hence , energy density , persisted for a long time .",
    "this resulted to a rapid domination of the energy density of the universe by these walls and to unacceptably large distortion in the cmbr .",
    "such an initial distribution on a lattice can be described statistically using percolation theory . on a three dimensional square lattice",
    ", there is a critical probability , @xmath12 , above which the associated vacuum will percolate across the entire lattice @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that , by initializing both vacua with a probability @xmath13 , both vacua propagate across the lattice .",
    "since domain walls lie on the interface between the two different vacua , this implies the formation of domain walls which extend across the entire universe .",
    "this gives a clear mathematical explanation for the press , ryden and spergel result .",
    "however , if for one vacuum @xmath14 , then this vacuum would form finite clusters in the percolating sea of the other one .",
    "the domain walls would then be small , finite bags which would disappear relatively rapidly .",
    "similar effects would hold in the case of potentials with non - degenerate minima @xcite . here",
    ", the true minimum will be at some stage energetically favoured , and domain walls will dissappear .    if a phase transition is triggered by fluctuations in a system in thermal equilibrium , and the vacua",
    "are trully degenerate , one expects the population probabilities of each vacuum to be equal .",
    "however , non - equilibrium phase transitions , which can occur in realistic models of the early universe , generically lead to a biased choice of vacuum state .",
    "indeed , an out - of - equilibrium scalar field @xmath15 living on an inflating de sitter space , observed over a physical volume @xmath16 , breaks into a classical and a quantum piece @xmath17 where @xmath18 satisfies the classical equation of motion and @xmath19 represents de sitter space quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 .        during inflation , and long afterwards , the hubble term is very large compared to the curvature of the potential and , thus , to a very good approximation , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant ( to next order , there is a tiny damped velocity @xmath22 ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath19 represents quantum fluctuations of the scalar field in de sitter space .",
    "these fluctuations result in the formation of a weakly inhomogeneous quasi - classical random field .",
    "after inflation ends , the frw horizon , @xmath23 , grows and fluctuations with scales less than the horizon are smoothed out .",
    "thus @xmath24 acts as an uv cut - off in the momentum distribution of this random field . in a spatial region of length @xmath25 ,",
    "the distribution of the fluctuations around @xmath21 can be calculated and is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( and , as has been discussed in @xcite , for fields produced towards the end of inflation , one can ensure that the longwavelength components in the fourier decomposition of the random field @xmath19 do not introduce unacceptable for our discussion correlations between the values of the random field at distant points ) .",
    "clearly , such transitions can only occur in a system that is too weakly coupled to achieve thermal equilibrium .",
    "a number of such biased transitions have been investigated , includingy those occurring in very light scalar fields in desitter space @xcite .",
    "the two disconnected minima are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively . at the phase transition",
    ", the field has some finite correlation length ( like the inverse ginzburg temperature in case of a transition triggered by thermal fluctuations ) over which the post - transition vacuum is chosen coherently , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "one can approximate the initial spatial structure of the vacuum produced during the transition by first dividing space into cells of volume @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the dimension , and second , by assuming that choices of the new vacua are made independently in each cell , giving the @xmath28-vacuum with probability @xmath32 and the @xmath29-vacuum with probability @xmath33,where @xmath34 .",
    "whenever the vacua in neighboring cells are different , a domain wall will form which interpolates between them , and so , typically , a complicated spatial network of domain walls will form .",
    "of course , an arbitrary spatial superposition of domain walls , such as that produced by the mechanism described above , is not a solution of the equations of motion and can not be stable .",
    "however , such a superposition represents physical initial conditions , the subsequent evolution of which is governed by the dynamics of the theory .",
    "subject to this dynamics , the initially static domain walls acquire non - zero velocities , oscillate under their surface tension , and interact with one another .",
    "this will be discussed in subsequent sections , where we will summarise the main ingredients , but also motivation and naturalness of out - of - equilibrium , biased phase transitions , where the bias can come from : + ( i ) small differences in the energy of the minima of the potential , and + ( ii ) different probabilities to reach these minima .",
    "how do we study the behaviour of a `` biased network '' ?",
    "the scalar field is initialized by randomly setting it equal to @xmath35 or @xmath36 at each lattice site , with bias probability @xmath32 for @xmath37 and @xmath33 for @xmath35 with @xmath38 .",
    "the lattice resolution corresponds to the initial field correlation length , and on physical scales above the resolution cut - off the field will have a white noise power spectrum ( yielding results similar to percolation theory ) . in this section ,",
    "we follow the study presented in @xcite and subsequently extended in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the scalar field , @xmath15 , is determined by the equation of motion .",
    "this has the form    @xmath39    and , introducing the conformal time @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 ) , it becomes    @xmath42    in the above , @xmath43 is the scale factor of the universe ( @xmath44 in the radiation era , and @xmath45 in the matter era ) , @xmath46 is the scalar potential and the spatial gradients are with respect to co - moving co - ordinates .",
    "then : @xmath47 @xmath48    the scalar potential determines the topology of the vacuum manifold .",
    "a typical choice is a @xmath49 potential @xmath50 with the two degenerate vacua , @xmath51 , separated by a potential barrier @xmath52 .    one can define a physical domain wall thickness @xmath53 given by @xmath54 the ratio of the wall thickness to the horizon size ( @xmath55 ) at the time of the phase transition @xmath56 then sets @xmath57 , the conformal time of the phase transition and the time at which we begin the simulation ( one needs the walls to be thinner than the horizon in order to study their dynamics , namely  @xmath58 ) .    here",
    "we assume that the expansion is dominated by some smooth component , filling the universe .",
    "the equation of state of this component is @xmath59 .",
    "this gives @xmath60 , and @xmath41 , @xmath61 .",
    "also , @xmath62    the equation of motion for static domain walls is @xcite @xmath63       \\equiv \\phi_0 \\tanh \\left[\\frac{a(z - z_0)}{w_0}\\right]\\ ] ] and for non - static ( boosted with a velocity @xmath64 ) : @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 .",
    "the energy and surface density of the walls is @xmath67\\ ] ] @xmath68    finally , during the expansion , the velocity of the wall changes according to @xmath69    let us now pass to run - away potentials , of the form @xmath70 in this case we do not have an analytic solution of the domain - wall type , interpolating between finite and run - away minima .",
    "however , we may still use the domain - wall language to describe the distribution of energy and topology of the vacuum .",
    "we shall call as ` domain walls ' the non - equilibrium configurations which appear on the lattice as joining field values in naighbouring lattice sites ; then , we can identify the position of these generalised walls as the link between the lattice sites occupied by different vacua . in the case of the run - away vacuum , we shall simply determine whether a field value at a given site belongs to the classical domain of attraction of that vacuum .    to further develop an intuitive feeling about the evolotion of the system we shall define a domain wall width , demanding that it should correspond to a distance in configuration space over which the field gradient is of the order of the potential energy of the local maximum that separates the vacua . in other words , @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the position of the maximum separating the domains of attraction of the finite minimum , @xmath73 , and of the run - away minimum ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the numerical implementation of the equation of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) is non - trivial .",
    "it involves discretisation of the equation of motion ( appendix i ) , which allows treating the domain wall network numerically .",
    "moreover , the calculations are very time - consuming , unless an optimisation of the time step is applied .",
    "we propose in appendix ii such a technique , which very significantly improves the efficiency of the code , and allows us to go to larger lattices and higher accuracies .",
    "the role of the size of the lattice is discussed in appendix iii .",
    "there are additional considerations to be made : to start with , the factor @xmath75 on the right hand side of the equation of motion makes the effective potential barrier grow with the expansion .",
    "the result is that , in comoving coordinates , the width of the walls decreases like @xmath76 , which is @xmath77 for radiation dominated and @xmath78 for a matter dominated universe .",
    "this implies that , on any reasonably sized grid , it is impossible to ensure that the walls would be visible on the lattice to the end of a calculation , when the horizon size is roughly the grid size . to appropriately represent walls ,",
    "their width should be of the order of a few lattice sites during the whole simulation ( in our case , we require the walls to be about five lattice sites wide since , if they become too wide , we lose the resolution ) .",
    "however , we know that the dynamics of the walls does not depend on their width once they get created and separated from each other @xcite , while the total surface energy and surface tension also do not depend on the width . as a result",
    ", one can consider a generalization of the equation of motion , which may force the walls to maintain a constant co - moving thickness while otherwise not altering their dynamics .",
    "this modified equation is @xmath79 and , for @xmath80 , we recover the initial equation of motion .",
    "if @xmath81 the walls will have constant comoving width .",
    "this choice does alter the scaling of the adiabatic effects of the hubble expansion ( @xmath82 ) , but this effect can be compensated by a proper choice of @xmath83 .",
    "it turns out that @xcite @xmath84 thus , for @xmath85 , we have to set @xmath86 to have the same scaling of the deviation of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , @xmath89    having obtained a consistent set of equations , the next step is to understand the relevant range of initial conditions and parameters . as in previous works , we will set @xmath90 . the scalar field initial conditions",
    "are then chosen using the prescription described above for various bias probabilities , @xmath32 .",
    "that is , in the following we will use percolation theory with allowed field values of @xmath91 at any lattice site .",
    "it is of interest to compare the evolution of the network initialized with two - point initial conditions with those initialized with various continuous distributions .",
    "we have done this for a uniform distribution which gives probability @xmath33 of choosing @xmath15 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 and probability @xmath32 of choosing between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and with a gaussian distribution @xmath95 such that @xmath96 . in general , the surface area of the initial network , measured at @xmath97 , is largest in the case of the two - point , percolative distribution . however , after a few steps of dynamical evolution the network stabilizes , and its important characteristics , such as surface energy or kinetic energy and their time evolution , become indistinguishable for a fixed bias @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the sharp initial conditions of percolation theory also give a good approximation to initial conditions softened by smooth distribution functions .",
    "this justifies the use of the pure two - point percolation theory initial conditions in this paper .",
    "we will set the initial field `` velocity '' , @xmath98 , to be zero everywhere on the lattice ( in previous work the results were found to be insensitive to small initial velocities with respect to the energy of the barrier @xcite ; this was done by repeated simulations with @xmath98 chosen from a uniform distribution of velocities between @xmath92 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "simulations are run in the radiation dominated epoch , with an initial time , @xmath101 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we chose a wall thickness @xmath102 , and a ratio @xmath103 ( see ( 11 ) ) .",
    "this value is used to ensure that the wall thickness is well above the lattice resolution scale ( recall @xmath104 ) , while also ensuring that for most of the dynamical range of the simulation , the wall  wall separation exceeds the wall thickness .",
    "we tested our code with the simplest case one can study , namely the double well potential , for which @xmath105 ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) .",
    "looking at the potential and the first derivative ( figure 2 ) we see that , while the potential is symmetric ( even ) , the first derivative is asymmetric ( odd ) :    this is a special situation , and this symmetry is violated in the case of the exponential potential discussed later on .    for the numerical part",
    ", we followed @xcite and @xcite , setting the values of the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath109 to reproduce the original equation of motion , equation  [ eqmot ] . in the runs",
    "the domain walls maintained a constant physical rather than co - moving thickness , and so problems of available dynamic range become important .",
    "the prescription used is as follows : the simulation is run on a @xmath110 lattice , with our standard field initial conditions and @xmath111 .",
    "using a wall thickness of @xmath112 , the initial conditions were evolved with the standard parameter values of @xmath113 and @xmath81 , until a time when the wall - wall separation exceeded the wall thickness ; that is , a time @xmath114 .",
    "the equation of motion was then changed , to set @xmath80 until a time @xmath115 .",
    "the co - moving thickness of the walls at the end of the simulation was then @xmath116 lattice sites . to compare , the run was repeated , this time leaving the standard parameter values fixed throughout the simulation .",
    "looking at the evolution of the energy density of the network of domain walls in three dimensions , ( in a radiation dominated epoch ) , we confirm the following results @xcite .",
    "@xmath117 for @xmath118 , the critical threshold of percolation theory , only one vacuum percolates the lattice , and isolated bags of one vacuum are to be found in a percolating sea of the more dominant vacuum .",
    "these bags rapidly decay under their surface tension .",
    "@xmath117 for @xmath119 both vacua percolate , leading to an initial network of infinite ( lattice sized ) domain walls",
    ". however , these also rapidly decompose into vacuum bags which then decay .",
    "@xmath117 only in the exact @xmath111 case is long - term scaling seen , dominating the energy density of the universe only in the case of @xmath111 .",
    "what is thus seen , is that , a network of domain walls forming well before matter - radiation equality , can be sufficiently massive to contribute significantly to large scale structure formation on comoving scales less than @xmath120 .",
    "however , such a network will decay before photon decoupling .",
    "an immediate question is whether superhorizon fluctuations can be of any relevance . in principle",
    ", such a possibility can arise , particularly in a universe with a significant hot dark matter component , and scale invariant primordial perturbations induced by an earlier inflationary epoch .",
    "however , similarly to @xcite , we found that , for much of the range of biases , wall networks turned out to be cosmologically innocuous , as their energy density exponentially decays with a characteristic time of only a few expansion times .",
    "simulations were made in both 3-dim and 2-dim ; in the later case walls stay around longer , but still , for any significant scaling of the network before the ultimate exponential decay , finetuning of @xmath32 close to @xmath121 is required .    in principle , one has to consider also the possibility of having bias in the initial velocities .",
    "however , for the double well potentials , modifications from such effects are negligible .",
    "the reason is that in this case the field is perfectly reflected to the minima by the external barriers ; this however is not what happens for the runaway potentials that we will proceed to discuss , as well as for periodic potentials .",
    "in the previous section , we summarised the expectations for potentials with degenerate minima .",
    "however , the behaviour of domain walls can change radically , in the case that the minima of the potential are unstable . before studying the domain wall dynamics that are to be expected",
    ", we would first like to discuss the naturalness of such solutions .",
    "this problem has been studied extensively in @xcite , where specific realisations of such scenarios have been proposed : in realistic standard model extensions , and particularly in superstrings there are usually several discrete groups @xmath122 .",
    "the fields in the theory then transform as @xmath123 , r=0,1, ..",
    ",n-1 , where @xmath83 is the @xmath124 root of unity , and the effective potential is constructed from @xmath122 invariant combinations of the fields . in non - supersymmetric models , for example , the lagrangian of a complex scalar field @xmath87 , transforming as @xmath83 has the form : @xmath125 where the coupling @xmath126 is made real by absorbing its phase in the field @xmath87 .",
    "the coupling @xmath127 is of order unity .",
    "the non - renormalisable terms of dimension @xmath128 arise because we have an effective field theory generated by physics at some ( high ) scale , m.    if @xmath129 is positive , the effective potential for @xmath87 has a minimum for non - vanishing value of the modulus and leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking of the discrete @xmath122 group . in this case",
    "it is convenient to reparametrize @xmath87 as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the v.e.v .",
    "( vacuum expectation value ) of @xmath87 , while @xmath132 and @xmath133 are real scalar fields .",
    "the potential of the field @xmath133 is then @xcite @xmath134 and , the value of the pseudo - goldstone mass is given by @xmath135 the potential of equation  ( [ eq : e3 ] ) has an n - fold degeneracy corresponding to @xmath136 .",
    "how can this degeneracy be lifted ?",
    "so far we have discussed domain walls which are expected to arise from the potential of a _ single _ scalar field @xmath87 .",
    "however additional scalar fields are also present .",
    "then , if , as is likely , the interactions between the fields cause more than one field transforming non - trivially under the discrete symmetry group to acquire a vev , it is possible to generate a situation in which the vacuum degeneracy is apparently lifted : if one of these fields acquires its vev before or during inflation the observable universe will have a unique value for its vev . after inflation the effective potential describing the remaining fields may still have an _ approximate _ discrete symmetry but the vacua will not be exactly degenerate .    to illustrate this , for instance in non - sypersymmetric models , consider adding to the above theories a second field @xmath137 . if @xmath87 transforms as @xmath138 and @xmath139 as @xmath140 under the symmetry group and assuming that @xmath141 and @xmath142 is integer in order to simplify the analysis , the potential is @xcite @xmath143 .",
    "\\label{eq : asy2}\\ ] ]    clearly there will be a dominant term , however the subdominant ones will _ slightly _ split the degeneracy of the potential .    having summarised the model building aspects , the next question is whether the domain walls to be expected in these theories can be of any relevance for structure formation .    in the case of non - degenerate minima",
    ", we expect that there is a critical scale at which the loss in surface energy from collapsing horizon - size bubbles becomes similar to the gain in volume energy by passing to the true minimim . at some stage",
    ", the true minimum will be favoured at all horizons , and walls will disappear . in this case , for subhorizon fluctuations , we will have a maximum scale , corresponding to the size of the horizon @xmath144 at the time that the walls disappear ( which today would correspond to @xmath145 ) .",
    "these could in principle generate structure for the smaller angular scales of wmap .",
    "the question of course is what is the situation regarding superhorizon fluctuations , and whether these can give any structure at the largest scales ( cobe , and the largest scales of wmap ) .",
    "the time when walls dissappear is specificed by a redshift @xmath7 , which is a calculable quantity , even before passing to any numerical simulation . for non - degenerate vacua there is always a critical bubble radius above which it is energetically favourable for the bubble of true vacua to expand gaining more volume energy than is lost in surface energy .",
    "once the horizon exceeds this critical radius bubbles of the true vacuum will expand everywhere at the speed of light to fill the whole universe and this occurs at the same time in all horizon volumes @xcite .",
    "then , if the non - degeneracy of the potential is measured by a factor @xmath146 . for instance , if walls decay during matter dominance , this determines the redshift @xmath7 to be @xmath147    in what follows , we combine biasing with non - degeneracy of minima , a situation that , according to the above , can arise for effective potentials generated by several weakly interacting scalar fields .",
    "then , if the minimum with the highest probability has a higher energy than the second one , we have two competing effects , which can allow modifications from previous results in the literature .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "to undestand these effects , we perform a numerical similation .",
    "a simple and generic parametrisation of the non - degeneracy of the potential is obtained by adding to @xmath148 a term linear in @xmath15 , namely    @xmath149    the monitoring of the extrema of the potential is shown in appendix iv . during the evolution ,",
    "the field `` feels '' only the derivative of the potential and the gradient of the field , thus it has the tendancy to evolve towards the place where the magnitude of the derivative is larger .",
    "this may in principle compensate the biasing of the initial distribution ; in fact , the two effects can be combined in such a way , that one produces a quasi - stable network , which is shown in figure 4 .",
    "+   +     in the upper panel of figure 4 , we present the evolution of the surface energy of the walls , as a function of the conformal time @xmath40 , for three different cases with the bias in the initial distribution corresponding to @xmath150 : + ( i ) the upper curve , ( a ) , corresponds to the case where the effect of the non - degeneracy of the minima , parametrised by @xmath151 , is partially cancelled by the bias in the initial field disribution .",
    "+ ( ii ) the middle curve , ( b ) , stands for the case of degenerate minima .",
    "+ ( iii ) the lower curve , ( c ) , denotes the case with a higher non - degeneracy of the minima , parametrised by @xmath152 .",
    "as expected , this choice leads to a rapid disappearence of the walls .",
    "the middle picture shows the behaviour of the surface energy of the network for different initial distributions and a fixed value of the non - degeneracy of the minima ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "+ ( i ) curve ( a ) is the same as above , with a bias given by @xmath154 .",

    "+ ( iii ) in curves ( b ) and ( c ) the initial bias of the distribution is given by @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively . in these cases",
    "the offset has been tuned in such a way that it compensates the effect of non - degeneracy .",
    "one should note that the necessary tuning is of the order of a few percent , enhancing the apriori probability of occupying the right vaccuum by about 5% .",
    "the lower panel shows the evolution of the mean value of the scalar field during the decay of the wall network , for the same choice of parameters as in the middle panel .",
    "curves ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) correspond to the respective ones in the middle panel .",
    "the outcome is that we were able to realise a quasi - stable network by combining two competing effects .",
    "runaway potentials arise commonly in theories of dynamical supersymmetry breaking , hence their collective dynamical properties deserve a careful study . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we assume the potential in the form        if we would like to identify the field @xmath160 with a stringy modulus , say a dilaton , then we would have to define @xmath161 , since @xmath15 defined in such a way is canonically normalised .",
    "this makes the potential above a doubly - exponential function of @xmath15 .",
    "however , in what follows we shall simply assume that the khler potential for @xmath160 is canonical - this simplification does nt introduce qualitatively new features in the simulations .",
    "in general , one can see that the doubly - exponential steepness of the potential makes the evolution more sensitive to the changes of the offset and the width of the distribution .",
    "the degeneracy of this potential can be lifted by adding a term of the form @xmath162 .",
    "the position of the extrema of the potential , and the way they are monitored in our simulations are discussed in appendix iv .",
    "we have studied runaway potentials for the parameter set of table [ ta1 ] , which corresponds to a weakly coupled vacuum .",
    "the expectation balue of @xmath160 ( @xmath163 ) corresponds to inverse square of a gauge coupling in a supersymmetric yang - mills theory .                in our simulation , we need these formulas to judge when the number of domain walls is too small to trust the numerical results . technically , because we are using periodic boundary conditions , after a finite time ( which is of the order of the lattice size over the velocity of the wall ) , a wall which leaves the horizon could return , because it comes to the lattice from the other side .",
    "this sets the limit of the simulations .",
    "thus , looking at the simulations , we can see that the average velocity of the walls is 0.5 , which means that the return time is approximately equal 2 times the lattice size .",
    "thus , this is the absolute upper limit on the huseful range of @xmath40s - because here we have a large lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the important thing is the position of the maximum , because this we use as the border between the left and right vacuum .",
    "one can always find numerically the position of the extrema , via the newton ",

    "<S> instabilities that would lead to a rapid decay of domain walls can be significantly ameliorated by compensation effects between a non - degeneracy of the vacua and a biased initial distribution , which can be naturally expected in a wide class or particle physics models that lead to out - of - equilibrium phase transitions . within this framework , it is possible to obtain domain walls that live long enough to be relevant for the cosmic power spectrum and galaxy clustering , while being compatible with the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies .    </S>",
