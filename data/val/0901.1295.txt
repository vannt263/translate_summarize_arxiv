    "sustained high sensitivity search of globular clusters ( gc ) for radio pulsars with improved pulsar - search algorithms have yielded so far 140 pulsars in 26 gcspfreire / gcpsr.html , compiled from radio timing observations by many groups . ]",
    "( camilo & rasio 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "radio pulsars can be timed more easily and accurately by ground - based telescopes over well - separated epochs , as the underlying neutron stars ( ns ) are less prone to noise from episodically varying accretion torques ( as for x - ray pulsars ) .",
    "these lead to the easier measurement of orbital parameters .",
    "binary systems can provide an important source of energy for gcs , since the binding energies of a few , very close binaries can approach that of a moderately massive host gc @xcite and therefore can have dynamical effects on the cluster s evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the observable parameters of the neutron stars and their binary companions in the clusters , such as spin , orbital period and eccentricity , projected radial position in the cluster , companion mass and their distributions provide a valuable test - bed to examine the theoretical scenarios of formation and evolution of recycled pulsars .",
    "these parameters can provide a tracer of the past history of dynamical interactions of the binary nss in individual gcs .",
    "we discuss below the distribution of orbital eccentricities and periods of gc pulsars in the light of interaction of stars with binaries already formed or in the process of formation inside globular clusters , due to the high stellar density in their cores .",
    "the observed distributions are examined with analytical results and our numerical experiments of scattering of stars simulated by direct n - body integration tools .",
    "although there are a number of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the gcs , their orbital period and eccentricity information is poorly known compared to radio pulsars ; moreover the initial eccentricity of formation is quickly quenched due to tidal coupling with the roche lobe filling companion .",
    "hence we concentrate entirely on binary radio pulsars whose companions are usually smaller than their roche lobes , and less well coupled tidally . of the 140 radio pulsars in the gcs , 74 binaries ( a large fraction of which are millisecond pulsars ) ,",
    "59 are isolated and 7 others have no published timing / orbital solutions .",
    "orbital parameters are not well determined for one binary ( psr j2140@xmath02310b in m30 ) , only the lower limit of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are known as @xmath3 days and @xmath4 and thus excluded from the present study . in fig",
    "[ fig : pulsars_all_group ] , we plot @xmath2 vs @xmath1 for 73 binaries in gcs with known orbital solutions .",
    "logarithmic scales in both eccentricity and orbital periods are chosen , as the enormous range of both variables and the regions occupied by observed pulsars are less obvious in linear scales . observed binary radio pulsars in gcs can be categorized into three groups : i ) 21 pulsars with large eccentricity ( @xmath5 ) ; ii ) 20 pulsars with moderate eccentricity ( @xmath6 ) ; iii ) 32 pulsars with small eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) . using the ` r ' statistical package k - means test",
    ", we show that these groups are distinct at a statistically significant level . ] .    in the database ,",
    "several pulsars orbital eccentricities have been listed as zero , but we assign them an arbitrarily small value of @xmath8 . note that the smallest eccentricity measurable is determined by how well the orbit of the binary is sampled and the overall timing accuracy achieved for radio pulse arrivals @xcite .",
    "the timing accuracy translates into an upper limit on the smallness of the eccentricity .",
    "this is displayed as the brown solid line in the lower left corner of fig [ fig : pulsars_all_group ] following the functional relation : @xmath9 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath10 is the inclination angle of the binary , @xmath11 is the pulsar mass , @xmath12 is the companion mass and @xmath13 is the timing accuracy . we take @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 for the  limit of timing sensitivity \" line .",
    "observational selection effects may be influencing the distribution of gc pulsars seen in fig [ fig : pulsars_all_group ] @xcite , the most important selection effect operates towards the left of the diagram : it is more difficult to detect pulsars with larger dm and/or shorter spin periods , especially millisecond pulsars in short orbital period and highly eccentric binaries .",
    "another important selection effect is due to distance , since only the brightest pulsars can be observed at large distance .",
    "the presence of a large number of lmxbs in gcs compared to the galactic field had led to the suggestion @xcite that a binary is formed by tidal capture of a non - compact star by a neutron star in the dense stellar environment of the gc cores .",
    "if stable transfer of mass and angular momentum ensued from the companion star , this could lead to recycled pulsars in binaries or as single millisecond pulsars e.g. @xcite .",
    "however tidal capture of a neutron star by a low mass main sequence star can lead to large energies being deposited in tides .",
    "the resultant structural readjustments of the star in response to the dissipation of the modes could be very significant in stars with either convective or radiative damping zones @xcite and the companion star can undergo a size  inflation \" due to its high tidal luminosity which may be much larger than that induced by nuclear reactions in the core .",
    "efficiency of viscous dissipation and orbit evolution is crucial to the subsequent evolution of the system as viscosity regulates the growth of oscillations and also the extent the extended star is bloated and shed . a significant fraction of the encounters lead to binaries that either become unbound as a result of de - excitation or heating from other stars in the vicinity or they are scattered into orbits with large pericenters ( compared to the size of the non - compact star ) due to angular momentum transfer from other stars @xcite . for a recent summary of the formation channels of retained neutron star binaries in gcs obtained via population synthesis , see ivanova @xmath18 ( 2008 ) .",
    "if the local binary fraction is substantial , the single star - binary interaction can exceed the encounter rate between single stars by a large factor @xcite .",
    "the existence of a significant population of primordial binaries in gcs @xcite indicate that three body processes have to be accounted for in any dynamical study of binaries involving compact stars . for a literature summary of the constraints on the binary fraction in globular clusters",
    "see davis @xmath18 2008 .",
    "an encounter between a field star and a binary may lead to a change of state of the latter , e.g. : i ) the original binary may undergo a change of eccentricity and orbital period but otherwise remain intact  a  fly - by \" interaction ; ii ) a member of the binary may be exchanged with the incoming field star , forming a new binary  an  exchange \" process ; iii ) two of the stars may collide and merge into a single object , and may or may not remain bound to the third star  a  merger \" process ; or iv ) all three stars become unbound  an  ionization \" process .",
    "formation scenario of millisecond pulsars in primordial binaries suggests that their eccentricity should be very small , @xmath19 ( phinney 1992 ) .",
    "but inside globular clusters , they may acquire eccentricity through interactions with single stars .",
    "rasio & heggie ( 1995 ) , heggie & rasio ( 1996 ) studied the change of orbital eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) of an initially circular binary following a distant encounter with a third star in a parabolic orbit .",
    "they used the secular perturbation theory , i.e. , averaging over the orbital motion of the binary for sufficiently large values of the pericentre distance @xmath21 , where the encounter is quasi - adiabatic and used non secular perturbation theory for smaller values of @xmath21 where the encounter is non - adiabatic .",
    "in the first case @xmath20 varies as a power law with @xmath22 and in the second case @xmath20 varies exponentially with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the semi - major axis of the binary ) .",
    "the power law dominates for @xmath24 and the exponential dominates for @xmath25 .",
    "they estimated the cross - sections ( @xmath26 ) for eccentricity changes and calculated time - scales for eccentricity changes as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number density of the stars and @xmath29 is the velocity of the incoming star .",
    "the expressions of the timescales for fly - by are ( see rasio & heggie 1995 ) : @xmath30 @xmath31^{-2/3 } ~\\rm { ~for~e \\gtrsim 0.01}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the number density ( @xmath28 ) of single stars in units of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the velocity dispersion ( @xmath29 ) in units of 10 km / sec in gcs ; @xmath1 is the orbital period in days giving @xmath35 in years .",
    "the eccentricities of the binary pulsars in gcs are likely to be due to binary single star interactions when the interaction timescale is less than the binary age .",
    "we take the maximum age of the binaries in a gc to be the globular cluster ages which are @xmath36 years .",
    "the value of @xmath37 which determines @xmath35 varies from 0.0024 - 2.167 for different globular clusters @xcite .",
    "we grouped them according to the values of @xmath37 and calculated @xmath35 with the mean values of @xmath37 for each of six groups . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsars_all_group ] , we plot the isochrones of fly - by encounters ( @xmath35 ) in the @xmath38 plane for all six groups using the above expressions .",
    "pulsars which lie inside or outside the globular cluster core in the projected image are depicted with different symbols and the colors are the same as that used to draw corresponding @xmath35 contours . if @xmath39 years for a particular binary , then it would not have interacted and it would preserve its original eccentricity . if @xmath40 years for a particular binary , then it could be eccentric due to fly - by interactions which is the case for most of the eccentric gc binaries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsars_all_group ] ) .",
    "so , many gc pulsars orbital eccentricities can be explained by fly - bys . however the local stellar densities at the pulsar positions ( especially with positional offset from cluster cores ) may indicate a higher @xmath37 value from central values used to calculate the isochrones .",
    "thus these pulsars might be in regions where the effective timescale for fly - by induced eccentricity is larger than the hubble time .",
    "moreover , for pulsars with high eccentricities ( @xmath41 , a majority of the group i pulsars ) a very close fly - by or multiple fly - bys are necessary if the initial binary was circular ( see heggie & rasio 1996 and camilo & rasio 2005 for a discussion ) . in these cases , other processes , @xmath42 exchange and merger may produce these systems more naturally .",
    "we discuss this below with numerical simulations .",
    "we have used the starlabstarlab/ ] software ( which reports the results for both resonant and non - resonant encounters for exchange and merger processes ) to perform numerical simulations .",
    "we discuss the results for pulsar binaries found in ter 5 , since it has the lowest value of the parameter @xmath43 where all classes of encounters can take place .",
    "we find that the  phase - space \" of the encounter reactions of different kind in 47 tuc and other clusters , is not as large as that of ter 5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : terzan_exch_merg ] , we plot @xmath44 of the initial binary along the top x - axis and @xmath45 along the bottom x - axis .",
    "@xmath45 is obtained from @xmath44 putting @xmath46 in the relation @xmath47 $ ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are masses of the members of the initial binary , @xmath50 is the mass of the incoming star , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are masses of the members of the final binary , @xmath53 is the fractional change of binary binding energy . for exchange , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; for merger , @xmath54 , @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear from the scatter plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : terzan_exch_merg ] ) that the final binaries will most probably have @xmath57 if they undergo either exchange or merger events .",
    "six high eccentricity ( @xmath41 ) binaries in terzan 5 are also shown ( red in colors , symbols same as used in fig [ fig : pulsars_all_group ] ) in this plot .",
    "all of them might result from exchange interactions with either a normal mass companion ( @xmath58 ) or with a low mass companion ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "psr u , x and z might even come from exchange with ultra low mass companion ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "note that all the exchange conclusions here are really guidelines , since they are based on stars of a single mass ( @xmath61 ) exchanging into the systems , and some of the minimum inferred companion masses are quite different from @xmath61 .",
    "mergers with @xmath62 ( initial ) companions and incoming @xmath61 stars are problematic because of the high final companion masses .",
    "q is the only system for which this might be possible , and that would require a fairly small orbital inclination angle .",
    "similar problems apply to initial companion masses of @xmath63 for all except q and u. finally , while the mass restriction is not really a problem for any of the lower - mass systems in the ultra - low - mass case , the small orbital periods imply that too long a time would have to pass before a suitable encounter took place .    in fig",
    "[ fig : pulsars_all_group ] , there is a cluster of three pulsars with @xmath64 and @xmath65 - ngc1851a , m3(d ) and ter 5(e ) , all with companions of mass in the range @xmath66 assuming @xmath67 ( except ngc 1851a which has a 1.12 @xmath68 companion ) .",
    "these are possibly white dwarf cores of red giant companions that overflowed roche lobe @xcite .",
    "such binaries would normally have therelic \" eccentricities @xmath69 ( phinney 1992 ) .",
    "the above binary pulsars with their presently mildly high eccentricities , have undergone fly - by encounters with field stars , rather than exchange reactions , which would produce very high eccentricities @xmath41 .",
    "ter 5 e lies outside the core but even then , the density may have been high enough to allow a strong fly - by interaction .",
    "it could also have been ejected out of the high density core after a strong interaction .",
    "in addition , the pulsar b1620@xmath026 ( in m4 ) occupies approximately the same region of the phase space .",
    "however , this system is most likely a triplet system with a planet sized third body and their interactions lead to the characteristics of the inner orbit ( thorsett @xmath70 1999 , ford @xmath18 2000 , sigurdsson @xmath18 2003 and references there in ) .",
    "another set of three millisecond pulsars have @xmath71 , @xmath72 ; ter 5 ( w ) , 47 tuc ( h ) and ngc6440 ( f ) .",
    "these clusters have low values of @xmath43 , and so fly - by encounters in these clusters would be efficient and could generate these eccentricities in gcs , even if their progenitor binaries had short orbital periods and had sub - giant companions of the nss .",
    "alternately , these binaries could also have been formed by fly - by interactions from a presently less abundant longer period @xmath73 cluster of  intermediate eccentricity \" binaries to the right of the pulsars seen in the middle of fig [ fig : pulsars_all_group ] .    the  intermediate eccentricity \" binaries ( group ii : @xmath74 ) , could have been generated by fly - by encounters with low ( or  zero \" ) eccentricity progenitor pulsars below the line of  timing sensitivity limit \" ( group iii pulsars )",
    ". some of the shorter @xmath1 binaries would again be circularised by gravitational radiation ( see @xmath75 contours in fig [ fig : pulsars_all_group ] calculated using the formalism of peters & mathews 1963 ) .",
    "the progenitor group iii pulsars , themselves occur in regions of favorable fly - by encounters inducing higher eccentricities .",
    "these nearly circular binaries have their @xmath1 in the range of @xmath76 days among which the tighter binaries can not be progenitors of exchanges / mergers whenever interaction timescales are greater than @xmath77 years ( see fig . [",
    "fig : terzan_exch_merg ] ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath78 above which they can undergo exchange / merger interactions decreases as @xmath49 decreases . about the origin of the group",
    "iii pulsars themselves , we note that camilo & rasio ( 2005 ) discuss the dynamical formation of ultra - compact binaries involving intermediate mass main sequence stars in the early life of the gc .",
    "these companions must have been massive enough ( beyond the present day cluster turn - off mass of @xmath79 ) so that the initial mass transfer became dynamically unstable , leading to tight ns - wd binaries through common envelope evolution .",
    "alternately , present day redgiant and ns collisions lead to a prompt disruption of the redgiant envelope and the system ends up as eccentric ns - wd binary ( rasio & shapiro 1991 ) .",
    "ns - wd binaries can be circularised to group iii by gravitational wave radiation if @xmath80 days ( see fig . [",

    ", we find that the presently observed orbital eccentricity and period data of gc binary pulsars are largely consistent with numerical scattering experiments on stellar interaction scenarios of fly - bys , exchanges and mergers with typical field stars characterizes by the central regions of the gcs .",
    "the efficiency of fly - by interaction is subject to the local stellar density at the location of the initially circular binaries .",
