    "hybrid bose - fermi systems reveal a number of the quantum collective effects , including superfluidity @xcite , polaron effects @xcite , cooper pairing and bcs - bec crossover @xcite , formation of supersolid state @xcite and others .",
    "all these phenomena are well studied from theoretical point of view in the domain of cold atoms . however , due to the large masses of the particles the characteristic temperatures of these effects are extremely small ( usually in nano- kelvin range ) , which makes their experimental observation extremely difficult and rules out any possibilities for their practical implementations .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that hybrid bose- fermi systems posessing intriguing properties can be realized in solid state heterostructures @xcite . due to the much smaller masses of the particles critical temperatures of quantum collective phenomena in this case",
    "become orders of magnitude bigger then for cold atoms . from this point of view , the hybrid systems containing exciton ( or cavity ) polaritons are of special interest , as polaritons have the smallest effective mass among all the particles observed in condensed matter system up to now ( about @xmath0 of the effective mass of the free electron ) .",
    "exciton polaritons are quasiparticles that arise from the strong coupling of microcavity photons with quantum - well ( qw ) excitons @xcite .",
    "being composite light- matter excitations , cavity polaritons reveal a set of unusual properties .",
    "their extremely small effective mass comes from their photonic component , while the presence of the excitonic component makes possible efficient polariton- polariton and polariton- phonon interactions leading to the thermalization of the polariton ensemble .",
    "combined with bosonic statistics , these leads to extremely high critical temperatures of the polariton bec ( about 20 k in cdte cavities @xcite and up to room temperature in gan cavities @xcite ) and large critical velocities of the polariton superfluid current @xcite .",
    "an important peculiarity of the polariton system is its spin structure : being formed by bright heavy - hole excitons , the lowest energy polariton state has two allowed spin projections on the structure growth axis ( @xmath1 ) , corresponding to the right and left circular polarisations of the counterpart photons .",
    "the states having other spin projections are split - off in energy and normally can be neglected while considering polariton dynamics .",
    "thus , from the formal point of view , the spin structure of cavity polaritons is similar to the spin structure of electrons , as both are two - level systems @xcite .",
    "the possibility to control the spin of cavity polaritons opens a way to control the polarization of the light emitted by a cavity , which can be of importance in various technological implementations including optical information transfer @xcite .",
    "exciton polaritons are electrically neutral and can not carry electric current .",
    "however , they may coexist and interact with free electrons or holes , if these carriers are introduced in the same qw with excitons or in the neighboring qw . when confined together",
    ", exciton polaritons and free carriers form bose - fermi mixture which is expected to exhibit peculiar optical and electronic properties @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effect of spin - dependent interaction of a bec of microcavity polaritons with a 2deg on the energy spectrum of elementary excitations in the hybrid system .",
    "we consider a quantum microcavity in strong coupling regime , which in addition to the qw with excitonic transition tuned in resonance with photonic cavity mode contains n - doped qw with two dimentional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the regime of the polariton bec created by non- resonant continous pump , for which quasi - equilibrium treatment can be applied @xcite .",
    "as polaritons are interacting particles , in the absence of free electrons the spectrum of the polariton bec reveals the bogoliubov - like renormalization showing linear dispersion near the ground state and parabolic dispersion at larger wave - vectors @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated if spinor nature of cavity polaritons is accounted for . due to the predominance of the exchange contribution in the scattering of 2d excitons @xcite ,",
    "the polariton - polariton interactions become strongly spin- anisotropic , with interaction of the polaritons having same circular polarization ( so called triplet configuration ) being strong and repulsive , and polaritons with opposite circular polarizations ( singlet configuration ) - weak and attractive @xcite . to minimize its energy polariton condensate forms with linear polarization @xcite and",
    "its dispersion contains two bogoliubov- like branches with slightly different sound velocities corresponding to the excitations polarized parallel or perpendicular to the polarization of the condensate @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate how the dispersions of the elementary excitations of the spinor polariton bec is modified by coupling with a plasmonic mode of 2deg .",
    "we show that due to the spin dependence of the polariton- electron interactions the spectrum of elementary excitations for two bogoliubov branches changes in non - symmetrical way .",
    "this effect can be viewed as renormalization of the matrix elements of the polariton- polariton interactions in triplet and singlet configurations , which can be tuned by increasing or decreasing bec-2deg coupling .",
    "investigation of spectrum as a function of the distance @xmath2 between qw with excitons and 2deg shows that at small @xmath2 the strong polariton- electron interaction leads to the onset of the effective attraction between polaritons leading to the collapse of the condensate phase , while at big @xmath2 polariton and electron systems become decoupled and standard bogoliubov and 2d plasmon dispersions are recovered . in the intermediate region ,",
    "the dispersions of the elementary excitations are qualitatively different from those revealed by uncoupled system .",
    "in particular , the difference between sound velocities of the bogoliubov branches corresponding to different polarizations of the elementary excitations of the condensate is strongly enhanced by polariton- electron coupling . moreover",
    ", the dispersion of the modes can become non- monotonous and reveal roton minimum , similar to those recently predicted for the hybrid system containing spatially separated electrons and indirect excitons @xcite .",
    "these radical changes of the dispersions in the presence of 2deg can strongly affect the real space propagation of the spinor polariton droplets and can be possibly used for spinoptronic applications @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these perspectives , however , lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss effective interactions in spinor polariton - electron mixtures . in section iii we obtain the expressions of elementary excitations which are analyzed in detail in section iv .",
    "conclusions summarize the results of the work .",
    "in this section we present the method of calculating the spin - dependent effective interactions in multilayered systems and apply it for the determination of spectrum of the elementary excitations . consider a system of two parallel semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) , one of which contains a free electron gas , and other containing a bec of excitons embedded into a photonic cavity ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the effective interaction between electrons and polaritons accounting their degree of freedom can be calculated analogicaly to spinless case@xcite .",
    "the effective matrix element of the interaction can be represented as a sum of the infinite series of the diagrams . in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and in the assumption",
    "that polariton condensate is weakly depleted , only certain types of the diagrams should be retained .",
    "for the electron system , these are diagrams corresponding to the excitations of virtual electron- hole pairs in a fermi sea ( so called `` polarization bubbles '' ) . for the polariton system",
    "these are diagrams corresponding to the interaction of the particle with a condensate accompanied by creation its excitation .",
    "the resulting set is shown at on fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "evaluation of feynman diagrams by using standard rules @xcite gives the 4@xmath3 effective interaction matrix accounting for the two possible projections for the electrons ( @xmath4 ) and polaritons ( @xmath5 ) and can be represented as @xmath6 where @xmath7 are @xmath8 matrices of bare spin- dependent interactions and @xmath9 is diagonal polarization matrix with the diagonal elements of electronic ( @xmath10 ) and excitonic ( @xmath11 ) polarizations .",

    "the interaction between polaritons and electrons leads to the formation of the hybrid plasmon- polariton modes , as it is discussed below .",

    "the matrix elements of the polariton - polariton interaction @xmath20 is spin - dependent due to strong exchange contribution @xcite .",
    "they depend on the geometry of the cavity and detuning between polariton and exciton modes@xcite .",
    "usually the matrix element for polariton interaction in anti - parallel spin configuration has opposite sign and is about one order of magnitude smaller than for parallel spins @xcite .",
    "the simple estimation of the matrix element of triplet polariton - polariton interaction which we use in a present paper can be obtain as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the exciton binding energy , bohr radius and the exciton hopfield coeficient , respectively .",
    "the matrix element of the interaction is singlet configuration is taken to be negative and 10 times smaller then for the triplet configuration , in agreement with the results of ref ..    the coupling between bosonic and fermionic systems is determined by matrix elements of the electron- polariton interaction .",
    "the interaction matrix element consists of the direct and exchange parts :    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are exciton and free electron momentum , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are radius vectors of bounded electron , bounded hole and free electron , respectively . the matrix elements @xmath32 can be expressed as @xmath33    the reason why the exchange term enters only into matrix element @xmath34 is illustrated at fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "as one sees , the exchange of electrons between exciton and electron for configurations @xmath35 does not change their spin states , while for configurations @xmath36 it leads to the transition of the exciton into dark state . in microcavity this process is blocked because dark states are uncoupled to a cavity mode and thus splitted in energy from polariton states by several mev .        for the case of separated qws",

    ", there appears a strong coupling between plasmonic and one of the bogoliubov modes , characterized by their anticrossing @xcite .",
    "we propose several possibilities of tuning the splitting between dispersion branches .",
    "first , it can be done by controlling of polarization of cavity exciton polaritons by using elliptically polarized continous pumping or by application of strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "increases the electron levels of the right quantum well , producing a tunnelling resonance when it matches the left quantum well electron energy . at resonance",
    ", the electron wavefunctions will be spread between both wells hereas the the left quantum well hole remains strongly confined . as a result ,",
    "the exciton aquires significant dipole moment and overplap between wavefunctions of free electron and exciton increases , thus increasing exchange interaction between them . ]",
    "second , one can use double - barrier structures to control an overlap between wavefunctions of electrons in 2deg and electrons in excitonic system as it is shown at fig.[fig10 ] . locating the electron gas in right qw and excitons in left qw and making favorable conditions for free electrons to tunnel through the barrier by changing the gate voltage , it is possible to control electron - polariton exchange interaction by controling the overlap between the wavefunctions as it is shown at fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "recently , such structures were proposed to create polaritons with high @xmath98 projections of the dipole moment@xcite .    according to the results of this paper",
    ", this will change the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "the latter strongly affects the real space propagation of the polariton droplets @xcite . as for the hybrid system",
    "the difference between the dispersions of the excitations co and cross polarized to the polarization of the condensate is strongly enhanced compare to isolated polariton bec , one can expect that a variety of spin- related phenomena will emerge in real space dynamics of polariton- electron mixtures .",
    "the detailed investigation of this issue lies , however , beyond the scopes of the present paper .",
    "in conclusion , we analyzed the effective interactions and elementary excitations in hybrid polariton- electron system accounting for the spin degree of freedom of the particles .",
    "we have shown that the exchange interaction plays a crucial role , and can lead to nontrivial phenomena , including the instability of the condensate for small electron- exciton separation and appearence of the hybrid plasmon- bogolon modes revealing roton minimum . besides , it was shown that splitting between elementary excitations with orthogonal linear polarizations is strongly enhanced as compare to isolated polariton system , which can be used for the purposes of spinoptronics .",
