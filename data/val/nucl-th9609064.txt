    "has the quark  gluon plasma been discovered at the sps ?",
    "the na50 collaboration reported a dramatic decrease in @xmath0 production in pb+pb collisions at 158 gev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "specifically , m. gonin presented at this meeting a striking ` threshold effect ' in the @xmath0to  continuum ratio as a function of a calculated quantity , the mean path length of the @xmath0 through the nuclear medium , @xmath2 , see fig .  1 .",
    "this apparent threshold has sparked considerable excitement as it may signal deconfinement in the heavy pb+pb system @xcite .    in this",
    "talk we report on work in ref .",
    "@xcite comparing pb results to predictions using a hadronic model of charmonium suppression .",
    "we first demonstrate that the behavior in the na50 plot is not a threshold effect but , rather , reflects the approach to the geometrical limit of @xmath2 as the symmetric pb+pb collisions become increasingly central . when plotted as a function of the _ measured _ neutral transverse energy @xmath3 as in fig .  2",
    ", the data varies smoothly as in s+u measurements in fig .",
    "4b below @xcite .",
    "the difference between s+u and pb+pb data lies strictly in the relative magnitude . to assess this magnitude",
    ", we compare @xmath0 and @xmath1 data to expectations based on the hadronic comover model @xcite .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "1 represents our calculation using parameters fixed earlier in ref .",
    "our result is essentially the same as the pb+pb prediction in @xcite .",
    "our primary intention in this work is to demonstrate that there is no evidence for a strong discontinuity between @xmath4a , s+u and pb+pb data .",
    "secondly , we show that our model predictions agree with the new pb+pb data .",
    "the consistency of our predictions can be judged by comparing our old @xmath4a and s+u calculations with more recent na38 and na51 data .",
    "however , we must be cautious about taking model details too seriously .",
    "regarding the first point , we quote maurice goldhaber : `` @xmath5 absence of evidence is _ not _ evidence of absence . ''",
    "moreover , we do not attempt to show that our comover interpretation of the data is unambiguous  this is certainly impossible at present .",
    "finally , the significance of our present results must be weighted by the fact that all @xmath4a and ab data are preliminary and at different beam energies . whether the newer data is indeed `",
    "improved ' has yet to be established .",
    "one should be particularly cautious in taking literally the values of model parameters , such as the comover density .",
    "the hadronic contribution to the suppression arises from scattering of the nascent @xmath0 with produced particles  the comovers  and nucleons @xcite . to determine the suppression from nucleon absorption",
    ", we calculate the probability that a @xmath6 pair produced at a point @xmath7 in a nucleus survives scattering with nucleons to form a @xmath0 .",
    "the standard @xcite result is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nuclear density , @xmath10 the impact parameter and @xmath11 the absorption cross section for @xmath0nucleon interactions .",
    "one can estimate @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the path length traversed by the @xmath14 pair . on average",
    ", @xmath13 can not exceed the nuclear radius @xmath15 , since the pair can be produced anywhere within the nucleus .",
    "suppression can also be caused by scattering with mesons that happen to travel along with the @xmath14 pair ( see refs .  in @xcite ) .",
    "the density of such comovers scales roughly with @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding survival probability is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the comover density and @xmath18 is the time in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "we write @xmath19 , where @xmath20 depends on the scattering frequency , the formation time of the comovers and the transverse size of the central region , @xmath21 , _ cf .",
    "( 8) .    to understand the saturation of the pb data with @xmath2 in fig .  1",
    ", we apply the schematic approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite for the moment to write @xmath22 where the brackets imply an average over the collision geometry for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath23 . the path length @xmath24 and transverse size @xmath25 depend on the collision geometry .",
    "the path length grows with @xmath3 , but most stop at the geometric limit @xmath26 in central collisions .",
    "explicit calculations show that nucleon absorption begins to _ saturate _ for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the smaller of the two nuclei , see fig .",
    "on the other hand , particle production and , consequently , @xmath3 continue to grow after @xmath2 saturates due , _",
    "e.g. _ , to fluctuations in the number and hardness of @xmath29 collisions .",
    "equation ( 2 ) falls exponentially in the ` super  central ' regime , @xmath27 , because @xmath20 is essentially fixed .",
    "important for understanding the na50 results is the fact that saturation occurs at larger values of the average impact parameter for pb+pb system compared to s+u , see fig .  6 below .",
    "this result reflects the striking geometric difference between symmetric and asymmetric nuclear collisions .",
    "specifically , in the s+u system there is large region , @xmath30 , where varying @xmath10 changes the volume of the interaction region dramatically .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "@xmath31 in pb+pb collisions and @xmath32  fm is large .",
    "we show below that typical values of @xmath10 corresponding to the @xmath33 region covered by na50 data do not go far into the region @xmath34 where [ the importance of @xmath10 being near zero for saturation to occur was overemphasised in sg s oral presentation of this talk . ]",
    "in fig .  1 , we compare the pb data to calculations of the @xmath0to  continuum ratio that incorporate nucleon and comover scattering .",
    "the contribution due to nucleon absorption indeed levels off for small values of @xmath10 , as expected from eq .",
    "comover scattering accounts for the remaining suppression .",
    "these results are _ predictions _ obtained using the computer code of ref .",
    "@xcite with parameters determined in ref .",
    "however , to confront the present na50 analysis @xcite , we must perform the following updates :    * calculate the continuum dimuon yield in the new mass range @xmath36  gev . *",
    "adjust the @xmath33 scale to the pseudorapidity acceptance of the na50 calorimeter , @xmath37 .",
    "the agreement in fig .",
    "1 depends strongly on these adjustments .",
    "we now review the details of our calculations , highlighting the adjustments as we go . for collisions at a fixed @xmath10 ,",
    "the @xmath0production cross section is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the product of the survival probabilities in the projectile @xmath40 , target @xmath41 and comover matter .",
    "the continuum cross section is @xmath42 the magnitude of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and their ratio is fixed by the elementary cross sections @xmath43 and @xmath44 . we calculate @xmath43 using the phenomenologically  successful color evaporation model @xcite . the continuum in the mass range used by na50 , @xmath45  gev ,",
    "is described by the drell  yan process @xcite . to confront na50 and na38 data in the appropriate kinematic regime ,",
    "we compute these cross sections at leading order using grv lo parton distributions with a charm @xmath46factor @xmath47 and a color evaporation coefficient @xmath48 from @xcite and a drell  yan @xmath46factor @xmath49 . using these cross sections to construct the normalized ratios in fig .",
    "2 corresponds to the first update .    to obtain @xmath33 dependent cross sections from eqs .",

    "we take @xmath62  gev , @xmath63 , and @xmath64  pb as appropriate for the dimuon  mass range @xmath65  gev .",
    "the @xmath33 distribution for s+u  @xmath66 from na38 was described @xcite using @xmath67  gev and @xmath63  the change in @xmath58 corresponds roughly to the shift in particle production when the pseudorapidity coverage is changed from @xmath68 ( na38 ) to @xmath37 ( na50 ) .",
    "taking @xmath62  gev is the second update listed earlier .",
    "though not shown here , we comment that the calculations agree with the na50 data at high @xmath3 , but differ somewhat at low @xmath3 due to the efficiency of the active target , which is lower for more peripheral collisions .",

    ", we take @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "a value @xmath83  @xmath84 was chosen to fit the central s+u datum . since we fix the density in central collisions , this simple _ ansatz _ for @xmath85 may be inaccurate for peripheral collisions .",
    "we expect the comover contribution to the suppression to increase in pb+pb relative to s+u for central collisions because both the initial density and lifetime of the system can increase . to be conservative , we assumed that pb and s beams achieve the same mean initial density .",
    "even so , the lifetime of the system essentially doubles in pb+pb because @xmath86 increases to 6.6  fm from 3.6  fm in s+u .",
    "the increase in the comover contribution evident in comparing figs .",
    "2 and 4b is described by the seemingly innocuous logarithm in eq .",
    "( 8) , which increases by @xmath87 in the larger pb system .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out that comovers were necessary to explain s+u data from the na38 1991 run @xcite .",
    "data just released @xcite from their 1992 run support this conclusion .",
    "the 91 @xmath0 data were presented as a ratio to the dimuon continuum in the low mass range @xmath88  gev , where charm decays are an important source of dileptons . on the other hand ,",
    "the 92 @xmath0 data @xcite are ratios to the drell  yan cross section in the range @xmath89  gev .",
    "that cross section is extracted from the continuum by fixing the @xmath46factor in the high mass region @xcite . to compare our result from ref .",
    "@xcite to these data , we scale the 92 data by an empirical factor .",
    "this factor is @xmath90 larger than our calculated factor @xmath91 ; these values agree within the na38 systematic errors .",
    "[ na50 similarly scaled the 92 data to the high  mass continuum to produce fig .  1 .",
    "] because our fit is driven by the highest @xmath33 datum , we see from fig .",
    "4b that a fit to the 92 data would not appreciably change our result .",
    "note that a uniform decrease of the ratio by 10% would increase the comover contribution needed to explain s+u collisions .",

    "such an error is consistent with ambiguities in current @xmath102 data near that low energy @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we present the following technical points . blaizot and ollitrault @xcite and kharzeev in these proceedings",
    "have observed that one can describe the measured total cross sections in @xmath4a and s+u in the absence of comovers if one takes @xmath103  mb .",

    "our calculated @xmath33dependent ratios do _ not _ agree with measurements , as shown in fig .  5",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of comovers in high @xmath33 events follows from the correlation between @xmath33 , centrality and particle ( comover ) multiplicity . on the other hand , comovers only contribute to the total s+u cross section at the @xmath105 level , because the impact  parameter integrated cross section is dominated by large @xmath10 and the distinction between central and peripheral interactions is more striking for the asymmetric s+u system .",
    "how well does our value @xmath1064.8  mb agree with the @xmath4a data ?",
    "we estimate the @xmath107 per degree of freedom to be 0.34 for @xmath108  mb and 1.3 for @xmath109  mb . both values of @xmath110 are close to unity and indicate reasonable fits .",
    "given the paucity of the data and the crudeness of the models , we consider the agreement to data to be equivalent .",
    "observe that including the measured s+u total cross section in extracting @xmath11 from data as in @xcite introduces an inappropriate bias .",

    "following @xcite we neglect comovers and equate ( 3 ) to our result for the @xmath0to continuum ratio from ( 1 ) and ( 4 - 6 ) .",
    "we then expand in powers of @xmath11 and equate the terms proportional to @xmath11 to find @xmath113^{2}t_{b}(b - s ) + t_{a}(s)[t_{b}(b - s)]^{2}\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "in summary , the pb data @xcite can not be described by nucleon absorption alone .",
    "this is seen in the na50 plot , fig .  1 , and confirmed by our results .",
    "the saturation with @xmath2 but not @xmath33 suggests an additional density  dependent suppression mechanism .",
    "earlier studies pointed out that additional suppression was already needed to describe the s+u results @xcite ; recent data @xcite support that conclusion ( see , however , @xcite ) . to study the s+u question further",
    ", experiments can search for saturation in super ",
    "central s+u reactions .",
    "more generally , while comover scattering explains the additional suppression , it is unlikely that that explanation is unique .",
    "sps inverse  kinematics experiments ( @xmath131 ) and ags @xmath4a studies near the @xmath0 threshold @xcite can help pin down model uncertainties .    in the context of our hadronic scenario , the success of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 predictions imply comover densities perhaps exceeding @xmath132  @xmath84 in pb+pb collisions .",
    "similar densities are found in string and cascade models of heavy ion collisions .",
    "we must ask if such hadronic models are applicable at such densities  they must certainly be at the very edge of their applicability .",
    "nevertheless , such models have proven very useful as predictive phenomenological tools . the ability to predict hadronic backgrounds that we have demonstrated is a prerequisite for using charmonium to search for new phenomena at rhic and lhc .",
