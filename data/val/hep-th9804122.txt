    "two ingredients , one from quantum field theory and other from mathematics of braids , are used @xcite : 0.2 cm    _ ( i ) field theoretic input : _ the first ingredient is that the chern - simons theory on a three - manifold with boundary is essentially characterized by a corresponding wess - zumino conformal field theory on that boundary@xcite : 0.2 cm    0.2 cm and chern - simons functional average for wilson lines ending at @xmath23 points in the boundary is described by the associated wess - zumino theory on the boundary with @xmath23 punctures carrying the representations of the free wilson lines : 0.2 cm    0.2 cm the chern - simons functional integral can be represented @xcite by a vector in the hilbert space @xmath24 associated with the space of @xmath23-point correlator of the wess - zumino conformal field theory on the boundary @xmath25 .",

    "an @xmath23-braid is a collection of non - intersecting strands connecting @xmath23 points on a horizontal plane to @xmath23 points on another horizontal plane directly below the first set of @xmath23 points .",

    "the braid may be projected onto a plane with the two horizontal planes collapsing to two parallel rigid rods .",
    "the over - crossings and under - crossings of the strands are to be clearly marked .",
    "when all the strands are identical , we have ordinary braids .",
    "the theory of such braids , first developed by artin@xcite , is well studied .",
    "these braids form a group . however ,",

    "these instead form a groupoid .",
    "the necessary aspects of the theory of such braids have been presented in ref.(8 ) .",
    "one way of relating the braids to knots and links is through closure of braids .",
    "we obtain the closure of a braid by connecting the ends of the first , second , third , .... strands from above to the ends of the respective first , second , third ..... strands from below as shown in ( a ) : 0.2 cm    0.2 cm there is a theorem by alexander@xcite which states that _ any knot or link can be obtained as closure of a braid .",
    "_ this construction of a knot or link is not unique .",
    "there is another construction associated with braids which relates them to knots and links .",
    "this is called platting .",
    "consider a @xmath26-braid , with pairwise adjacent strands carrying the same colour and opposite orientations . then connect the @xmath27th strand with @xmath28th from above as well as below .",
    "this yields the plat of the given braid as shown in ( b ) above .",
    "then there is a theorem due to birman@xcite which relates plats to links .",

    "chern - simons functional integral over this manifold is a state in the tensor product of the hilbert spaces associated with the two boundaries , @xmath40 .",
    "this state can be expanded in terms of some convenient basis@xcite .",
    "these bases are given by the conformal blocks for @xmath30-point correlators of the @xmath41 wess - zumino conformal field theory .",
    "an arbitrary braid can be generated by a sequence of elementary braidings .",
    "the eigen values of these elementary braids are given by conformal field theory .",
    "a knot is given with some framing .",
    "standard framing is such that the self - linking number of the knot ( linking number of the knot and its frame ) is zero .",
    "the braiding eigenvalues depend on the framing . for standard framing eigen - values for an elementary braiding two strands carrying spins @xmath42 and with orientations @xmath43 are@xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the quadratic casimir invariant of the spin @xmath16 representation , @xmath47 and @xmath48 takes the values allowed in the product of representations of spin @xmath16 and @xmath49 by the fusion rules of @xmath41 wess - zumino conformal field theory , @xmath50 @xmath51 . when @xmath52 , the two strands have the same orientation and the braid generator introduces a right - handed half - twist . on the other hand for @xmath53 , two strands are anti - parallel and braid generator introduces a left - handed half - twist .",
    "thus @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the eigen - values for elementary braidings introducing right - handed half - twists in parallely and anti - parallely oriented strands respectively .",
    "writing the weaving pattern @xmath56 in figure ( a ) above in terms of the elementary braids , the chern - simons functional integral over this manifold is given by a matrix @xmath57 in @xmath40 .",
    "to plat this braid , we consider two balls with wilson lines as shown in figures ( b ) and ( c ) above .",
    "we glue these respectively from above and below onto the manifold of figure ( a ) .",
    "this yields a link in @xmath1 .",
    "the chern - simons functional integral over the ball ( c ) is given by a vector in the hilbert space associated with the @xmath29 boundary .",
    "this vector  @xmath58  can again be written in terms of a convenient basis of this hilbert space .",
    "similarly , the functional integral over the ball of figure ( b ) above is a vector  @xmath59   in the associated dual hilbert space . gluing these two balls on to each other gives @xmath23 disjoint unknots carrying spins @xmath60 in @xmath1 . their invariant factorizes into the invariants for @xmath23 individual unknots .",

    "next gluing the two balls ( b ) and ( c ) on to the manifold of figure ( a ) , is just taking the matrix element of the matrix @xmath56 between these two vectors .",
    "this would thus yield a link - invariant @xcite : 0.2 cm    * proposition : *  _ expectation value of a wilson operator for an arbitrary _ @xmath30 _ coloured - oriented link with a plat representation in terms of a coloured - oriented braid _",

    "jones polynomials are obtained by placing spin @xmath67 representations on all the component knots . when spin @xmath68 representations are placed on them , we have akutsu - wadati / kauffman invariant@xcite . for higher spins , we have new invariants",
    ".    these invariants are generally sensitive to the chirality of many knots .",
    "for example , for left- and right - handed trefoils @xmath69 , these invariants are different : @xmath70 for @xmath71 the invariants for the mirror reflected knots are give by simple complex conjugation .",
    "these invariants do not detect chirality of all knots .",
    "for example , upto ten crossing numbers , there are six chiral knots , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( as listed in the knot tables of rolfsen s book@xcite ) which are not distinguished from their mirror images by jones ( spin 1/2 ) polynomials : 0.2 cm    0.2 cm    kauffman / akutsu - wadati ( spin one ) polynomials do detect the chirality of four of them , namely @xmath78 .",
    "but for @xmath79 both jones and kauffman polynomials are not changed under chirality transformation @xmath80 .",
    "however , the new spin @xmath81 invariants are powerful enough to distinguish these knots from their mirror images@xcite .    while it does appear that these new invariants are more powerful as we go up in spin , @xmath82 , it is not true that chirality of all knots can be detected by these invariants",
    ". we shall give below an example where none of the invariants obtained from chern - simons theories detect the chirality of a @xmath83 crossing knot .",
    "besides chirality , there is another interesting property of knots and links which we would like to be detected by knot invariants .",
    "this is the `` mutation '' of knots and links . to study this ,",
    "consider a link @xmath84 obtained from two rooms   and   with two strands going in and two leaving in each of them as shown in the figure @xmath84 :    0.2 cm    0.2 cm    the mutant links are obtained in the following way : ( i ) remove one of the rooms , say   from @xmath84 and rotate it through @xmath85 about any one of the three orthogonal axes ( @xmath86 ) as shown in the figure :    0.2 cm    clearly only two of these rotations are independent : @xmath87 ( ii ) change the orientations of the lines inside the rotated room   to match with the fixed orientations of the external legs of the original room   .",
    "( iii ) then , replace this room back in @xmath84 .",
    "this yields for @xmath88 and @xmath89 mutations of   mutant links @xmath90 and @xmath91 as shown above .",
    "we shall argue that no invariants obtained from chern - simons theory distinguish these mutants@xcite . in the following discussion in this section",
    "we shall take the gauge group @xmath9 of the chern - simons theory to be arbitrary and shall not specialize to the @xmath7 gauge group .",
    "next observe that the link @xmath84 in @xmath1 can be obtained by gluing a three - ball containing room   as shown in figure ( i ) below with another three - ball with oppositely oriented boundary @xmath29 containing room   as shown in figure ( ii ) .",
    "similarly , gluing figures ( iiia ) and ( iva ) on to figure ( i ) will give corresponding mutant links @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively :    0.2 cm    0.2 cm    notice , the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in each of the figures ( iii ) and ( iv ) are equivalent ; these can be changed into each other by simple isotopic moves of the strands .",
    "the functional integrals over these balls can be represented by vectors in the hilbert space associated with the four - punctured boundary @xmath29 of each of them .",
    "for example , for the three - ball in figure ( ii ) , we may write the functional integral in a convenient basis   @xmath92   characterized by the four - point correlators of the associated wess - zumino conformal field theory on @xmath29 as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 are coefficients characterizing the entanglements in the room   and the basis with superscript  side \" refer to an eigen - basis for the elementary braiding generators @xmath95 and @xmath96 introducing left - handed half - twists in the first two and last two anti - parallel strands respectively : @xmath97 here the twisted side two strands are antiparallel and carry representations @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the index @xmath100 runs over all the irreducible representations in the fusion rule of @xmath101 of the corresponding wess - zumino model .",
    "an equivalent basis @xmath102 is one where braid generator @xmath103 , which introduces right - handed half - twists in the central two strands , is diagonal : @xmath104 since this refers to twisting of parallel strands both carrying representation @xmath98 , the index @xmath105 refers to the allowed irreducible representations in the fusion rule @xmath106 of the corresponding wess - zumino model .",
    "the two bases are related by @xmath107-racah coefficient of the quantum group @xmath108@xcite : @xmath109 { \\ket { \\phi_m^{cent}(\\bar r , r , r,\\bar r)}}~.\\ ] ] the eigenvalues @xmath110 and @xmath111 for right - handed half - twists in two anti - parallel and parallel strands are respectively @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the quadratic casimir invariants in the representations @xmath98 , @xmath105 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "depending upon the representation @xmath100 ( @xmath105 ) occurring symmetrically or antisymmetrically in the tensor product @xmath101 ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 .",
    "further @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the quadratic casimir invariant in the adjoint representation and @xmath12 is the chern - simons coupling .",
    "now notice that the diagram ( iiib ) can be generated by applying the braid generators @xmath95 and @xmath120 on the diagram in figure ( ii ) with interchanged orientation and representation assignments on the first and second , third and fourth strands ending on the boundary .",
    "therefore , we can relate the vectors representing the fuctional integral over these manifolds as @xmath121 since @xmath95 and @xmath96 commute and are diagonal in the same basis with same eigenvalues ( [ eva ] ) , @xmath122 @xmath123 .",
    "thus the chern - simons functional integral for the manifold of figure ( iii ) is same as that for the manifold in figure ( ii ) : @xmath124 such statements will not hold if we increase the number of wilson lines in these manifolds .    in order to obtain the action of a @xmath89-mutation ,",

    "also akutsu - wadati polynomials @xcite obtained from @xmath145 state vertex models correspond to @xmath7 with spin @xmath146 representation being placed on the knot / link .",
    "hence the fact that all these polynomials do not distinguish mutants is a special case of the above result .",
    "now let us give an example of a pair of sixteen crossing mutant knots :    0.2 cm    0.2 cm    the two knots are related by mutation of the room indicated by dashed enclosure .",
