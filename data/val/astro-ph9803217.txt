    "sedov ( 1946 ) , taylor ( 1950 ) and von neumann ( 1947 ) discovered , in the forties , a self similar solution of the strong explosion problem , in which a large amount of energy is released on a short time scale in a small volume .",
    "this solution is known today as the `` sedov - taylor '' self similar solution .",
    "it describes a shock wave propagating into a uniform density surrounding . the shock wave and the matter behind it decelerate as more and more mass",
    "is collected .",
    "this solution describes well the adiabatic stage of a supernova remnant evolution .",
    "blandford and mckee ( 1977 ) have later established a self similar solution describing the extreme relativistic version of the strong explosion problem . in this solution",
    "the lorentz factor of the shock and the fluid behind it is much larger than unity .",
    "such high lorentz factors arise if the rest mass contained within the region where the energy @xmath3 was released is much smaller than @xmath3 . in other words when the region containing the energy is `` radiation dominated '' rather than matter dominated .",
    "such a region was later termed a `` fireball '' .",
    "cavallo and rees ( 1978 ) have considered the physical processes relevant in a radiation dominated fireball as a model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "goodman ( 1986 ) and paczyski ( 1986 ) have then considered the evolution of such a fireball .",
    "they have shown that a initially the radiation - pair plasma in a purely radiative fireball behaves like a fluid and it expands and accelerated under its own pressure until the local temperature drops to @xmath4kev , when the last pairs annihilate and the fireball becomes optically thin .",
    "later shemi and piran ( 1990 ) considered matter contaminated fireballs .",
    "they have shown that , quite generally , all the initial energy will be transfered to the baryons in such fireballs whose final outcome is a shell of relativistic freely expanding baryons .",
    "piran , shemi and narayan ( 1993 ) and msazros laguna and rees ( 1993 ) have later carried these calculations in greater details .",
    "these works show that an initially homogeneous fireball will first accelerate while expanding and then coast freely as all its internal energy was transformed to kinetic energy .",
    "the surrounding matter will eventually influence the fireball after enough external matter has been collected and most of the energy has been transfered from the shell to the ism .",
    "if the surrounding matter is diluted enough , then this will take place only after the initial free acceleration phase .",
    "this influence was considered by msazros and rees ( 1992 ) , and katz ( 1993 ) , who suggested that the grb is produced during this stage .",
    "the detailed shock evolution was later studies by sari and piran ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is only after these stages , that the fireball have given the ism most of its energy and then the self similar deceleration solution of blandford - mckee applies . when the shock decelerates enough so that it is no longer relativistic , it is described by the sedov - taylor solution .    today",
    "it is widely accepted that grbs involve relativistic expanding matter of this kind . while the grb itself is produced , most likely , via internal shocks ( narayan , paczyski & piran , 1992 ; rees & msazros , 1994 ; sari & piran , 1997 ) . the observed grb afterglow corresponds , on the other hand to the slowing down of this relativistic flow .",
    "this has led to an increasing interest in the fireball solution and in its various regimes . in this paper",
    "we study the evolution of a homogeneous fireball focusing on its interaction with the surrounding matter .",
    "we do not consider here internal shocks , which arise due to interaction within the relativistic flow and require nonuniform velocity .",
    "we have developed a spherically symmetric relativistic lagrangian code based on a second order gudnov method with an exact riemann solver to solve the ultra - relativistic hydrodynamics problem . with this code",
    ", it is possible to track the full hydrodynamical evolution of the fireball within a single computation , from its initial `` radiation dominated '' stage at rest through its acceleration , coasting , and shock formation , up to the relativistic deceleration and finally to the newtonian deceleration . with typical parameters this computation spans more than eight orders of magnitudes in the size of the fireball and more than twenty orders of magnitudes in its density .",
    "we describe these computations here .",
    "we show that , quite generically , the solution converges during the relativistic deceleration phase to the blandford - mckee solution and then it transforms to the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "even though the attractive nature of the blandford - mckee solution suggests that it is stable we explore explicitly the stability of this solution and we show that it is stable to radial perturbations .",
    "we review , first , in section [ sec_analytic ] the current analytic understanding of the fireball evolution thorough the following stages : ( i ) free acceleration and coasting , ( ii ) energy transfer ( iii ) relativistic self similar solution and ( iv ) newtonian sedov - taylor solution .",
    "we discuss the numerical results in section [ numerical ] . in section [ perturbation ]",
    "we examine the evolution of perturbations to the blandford - mckee solution .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the evolution of a fireball is characterized by several phases .",
    "the transitions between these phases are determined by several critical radii that are summarized in table [ t : radii ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we consider a homogeneous fireball of energy @xmath3 and a baryonic load of total mass @xmath5 confined initially in a sphere of radius @xmath6 .",
    "we define the dimensionless entropy ( or the initial random lorentz factor ) @xmath7 .",
    "this fireball expands into a surrounding low density medium ( with a density @xmath8 ) which we will refer to as the ism .",
    "this can be considered to be a free expansion in its initial stage .",
    "after a short acceleration phase , the motion becomes highly relativistic .",
    "conservations of baryon number , energy and momentum yield the following conservation laws along a null flow line of each fluid element in the shell ( piran , shemi & narayan , 1993 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radius , lorentz factor , pressure and rest mass density of the fluid element , respectively . in this paper ,",
    "distance , time , velocity and the corresponding lorentz factors are measured in the observer frame .",
    "thermodynamic quantities ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are measured in the local fluid frame .",
    "we use units in which the speed of light @xmath16 .",
    "the above equations assume an adiabatic gas index of @xmath17 .",
    "initially the fireball is extremely hot ( @xmath18 ) , so that equation ( [ eq : linear ] ) yields @xmath19 ( goodman , 1986 ; paczyski , 1986 ; shemi & piran , 1990 ) .",
    "the fireball is approximately homogeneous in the local frame , but due to relativistic effects it appears it appears to an observer at rest as a narrow shell with a radial width @xmath20 ( shemi & piran , 1990 ; piran , shemi & narayan , 1993 ) . as the fireball expands , the internal energy is converted into kinetic energy of the baryons . at the radius @xmath21 ,",
    "the fireball uses up all the internal energy and the approximation @xmath18 breaks down .",
    "this is the end of the acceleration phase .",
    "now , the internal energy of the fireball becomes negligible compared to the rest mass energy ( @xmath22 ) , and equation ( [ eq : linear ] ) yields @xmath23 ( piran shemi & narayan , 1993 ) . the fireball behaves like a pulse of energy with a frozen radial profile propagating at almost the speed of light .",
    "this frozen pulse approximation on which equation ( [ eq : linear ] ) is based breaks down ultimately at the radius @xmath24 .",
    "each fluid shell moves with a slightly different velocity and the fireball begins to spread at @xmath25 .",
    "internal shocks will take place around @xmath25 if the fireball is inhomogeneous and the velocity is not a monotonic function of the radius .",
    "as mentioned earlier , these shocks produce , most likely , the observed grb .",
    "however , even under optimal condition they can not convert more than about a quarter of the kinetic energy to radiation .",
    "hence even an inhomogeneous shell will continue carrying ample kinetic energy beyond this stage .",
    "we consider here only homogeneous fireball .",
    "the possible effect of internal shocks on the fireball evolution has been discussed extensively in another papers ( kobayashi , piran & sari , 1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch , 1997 )    the coasting can also end if the surrounding matter begins to influence the shell .",
    "the interaction between the shell and the ism can be described by two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "sari and piran ( 1995 ) have defined three critical radii in this respect : @xmath26 where the energy density produced by the shocks becomes high enough so that the reverse shock is relativistic and begins to reduce the lorentz factor of the shell considerably ; @xmath27 where the reverse shock crosses the shell ; and @xmath28 where the mass of the shocked ism is @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the sedov length .",
    "fortunately , a simple relations between these four radii can be given in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath31 ; @xmath32    if initially @xmath33 then @xmath25 is the smallest radius .",
    "the shell begins to spread at @xmath25 .",
    "after that the width @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 and the scaling of the shell parameters becomes @xmath36 during the spreading phase the value of @xmath37 decreases .",
    "however , as long as @xmath33 the relation @xmath38 is valid .",
    "when @xmath39 these different radii become comparable : the reverse shock crosses the shell , it becomes mildly relativistic and an ism mass of @xmath29 was collected .",
    "since the reverse shock is just mildly relativistic at this stage , the shell s lorentz factor have changed only by a factor of order unity .",
    "we call this the newtonian reverse shock ( nrs ) case since the reverse shock is newtonian relative to the unshocked shell .",
    "this is not to be confused with the fact that @xmath2 in this case and the forward shock is ultra - relativistic .",
    "if initially @xmath40 then @xmath41 is the smallest radius .",
    "the reverse shock becomes relativistic before it crosses the shell . at @xmath42",
    "the reverse shock begins to reduce considerably the lorentz factor of the shell s matter that it crosses .",
    "the lorentz factor of the shocked material is @xmath43 ( sari , 1997 ) .",
    "the shell has decelerated significantly by the time that the reverse shock has crossed the shell at @xmath44 . at this stage ,",
    "the lorentz factor was reduced from its initial value of @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "we call this the relativistic reverse shock ( rrs ) case as most of the deceleration is done by a strong relativistic reverse shock .    the coasting radius , when the shell begins to coast freely , @xmath47 , is related to the other radii by a simple relation , @xmath48 . in the nrs case @xmath37 and @xmath47 is the smallest radius .",
    "all the initial thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy before the shell begins to decelerate . in the rrs case ( @xmath49 ) it is possible that the deceleration , due to external matter , begins before all the energy of the fireball was converted to kinetic energy .",
    "the conditions @xmath50 and @xmath49 yield @xmath51 ( see figure [ fig : delta_eta ] ) : @xmath52 should be larger than @xmath53 in order that @xmath54 .",
    "we limit the discussion to this case here,@xmath50 , i.e. , the fireball transforms all its internal energy to kinetic energy before the ism begins influence its evolution .",
    "the nrs case is relevant if the initial fireball is small and contains relatively many baryons ( equivalently , @xmath45 is relatively small ) , while the rrs case is relevant if the fireball is large and it is less polluted by baryon .",
    "the shell has given the ism most of its energy either at @xmath55 in the nrs case , or at @xmath44 in the rrs case ,      for @xmath56 for the nrs case , or @xmath57 for the rrs case , the shocked ism contains most of the energy @xmath3 . from this stage",
    "the shell plays a negligible part in the consecutive evolution .",
    "the profile of the shocked ism is determined now just by two parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "when the forward shock reaches a radius @xmath58 the fireball has a mass @xmath59 .",
    "the energy in the shocked fluid is therefor @xmath60 .",
    "since this equals the total energy of the system @xmath3 , we obtain a scaling law , @xmath61 .",
    "the exact proportionality constant depends on the profiles behind the shock .",
    "blandford and mckee ( 1976 ) describe an analytic self similar solution , in which the lorentz factor , the density and the pressure are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the lorentz factor of the shock itself , and the similarity variable @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 .",
    "the shock radius is given by @xmath66 .",
    "in the previous section @xmath67 denotes the radius of a fluid element in the shell , but @xmath67 and @xmath68 are independent coordinates here .",
    "the blandford - mckee self similar solution is derived with the assumption @xmath69 .",
    "this assumption breaks down when the shock sweeps out a volume @xmath70 of ism and its motion becomes non - relativistic . at the radius @xmath71 the sedov - taylor ( sedov , 1946 ; von neumann , 1947 ; taylor , 1950 ) solution becomes a good approximation .",
    "a characteristic length scale at a time @xmath68 , which we can form from the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath8 , gives the shock radius @xmath72 within a numerical constant factor @xmath73 depending on the adiabatic constant @xmath74 ( @xmath75 for @xmath76 ) .",
    "the velocity of the shock is @xmath77 .",
    "the velocity @xmath78 , the density @xmath79 and the pressure @xmath80 just behind the shock can be expressed in terms of @xmath81 : @xmath82 for the adiabatic index @xmath76 . the profile throughout the region behind the shock",
    "is given by the velocity @xmath83 , the density @xmath84 and the pressure @xmath85 ( landau & lifshitz , 1987 ) .",
    "the dimensionless variables @xmath86 are functions of the similarity variable @xmath87 only and are given in an implicit analytical form by the following equations : @xmath88 the pressure ration @xmath89 tends to a constant as @xmath90 , while @xmath91 , @xmath92 in this limit .",
    "we consider an initial uniform spherical fireball surrounded by a uniform cold ism .",
    "the initial conditions are determined by four parameters : the total energy @xmath3 , the baryonic mass @xmath93 and the radius @xmath6 of the fireball and the ism density @xmath8 .",
    "a `` cold '' ism means that its pressure is negligible compared to the pressure behind the shocks throughout the whole evolutions . for convenience , we set the initial time as @xmath6 rather than zero . we have chosen two sets of initial conditions to represent the the rrs and the nrs cases : @xmath94erg , @xmath95proton @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 cm for the nrs case ( @xmath99 ) , and @xmath94erg , @xmath95proton @xmath96 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 cm for the rrs case ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we assume that the fluid is described by a constant adiabatic index @xmath76 although in reality this is not alway true .",
    "the shell s matter may cool during the coasting phase .",
    "however at the end of the coasting stage , the reverse shocks heat the fireball shell , and the ism shocked by the relativistic forward shock carries most of the energy @xmath3 .",
    "the main part of the system is subject to relativistic particles again .",
    "the forward shock is decelerated as @xmath103 and it becomes newtonian at @xmath71 . after that",
    "the scaling laws in the newtonian regime depends on the adiabatic constant . but even then the shocked electrons will remain relativistic for a long time after this transition and the adiabatic index will remain around @xmath17 .",
    "figures [ fig : glob_n],[fig : glob_r ] depict the evolutions of the lorentz factors for the nrs and the rrs cases , respectively .",
    "one clearly sees the initial acceleration phase in which the lorentz factor increases linearly with time .",
    "this is followed by a coasting phase in which the lorentz factor is a constant : @xmath45 .",
    "this stage ends when the effect of ism becomes significant and most of the kinetic energy is dissipated at @xmath104 or @xmath44",
    ". then a self similar phase begins in which the lorentz factor of the forward shock decreases like @xmath105 . at @xmath71",
    "the solution becomes non relativistic and it turns into the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "a difference appears between the nrs and the rrs fireballs only in the energy transfer phase . as expected a sharp decrease in @xmath106",
    "is seen in the rrs case .",
    "a more gradual transition is seen in the nrs case .    in the following sections we compare the numerical results with the analytic estimates .",
    "we examine the validity of the estimates of @xmath47 , @xmath25 , @xmath44 , @xmath104 , @xmath41 and @xmath71 as indicators of transition scales .",
    "a highly relativistic shell is formed after a short acceleration phase ( see figure [ fig : pulse ] ) .",
    "the width of the shell is constant in this acceleration stage ( figure [ fig : pulse_comp ] ) . the density and the pressure peak at the same position in the local fluid frame . in the observer frame ,",
    "the outer part of the shell has a higher lorentz factor and the density peak is wider than the pressure peak .",
    "the density peak ( dotted line ) moves ahead of the pressure peak ( solid line ) in the observer frame ( figure [ fig : pulse_comp ] ) .",
    "the average lorentz factor of the each fluid element in the shell increase as the radius of the shell increases , @xmath107 . however , the lorentz factor of the outermost layers is well above the average .",
    "this is results from the initial sharp edges of the fireball .",
    "the initial acceleration of the outermost layers depends on the steepness of the initial pressure distribution at the edge of the fireball .",
    "the initial step function distribution that we have chosen leads to large acceleration of the outermost layers .",
    "we can regard the thin region at the boundary of the fireball as expanding in the free expansion velocity , independent of the fireball thickness @xmath34 .",
    "however , this fast layer is thin and its mass is negligible . except of the evolution of the maximal lorentz factor ( at the outermost layers ) the evolution of the bulk of the fireball is not effected by the choice of the initial steepness of the boundary .",
    "the initial conditions are washed out later , when the interaction with the ism is significant , and even the maximal lorentz factor is then independent of the initial conditions .",
    "therefore we do not discuss this maximal value , but instead we consider the average lorentz factor over the `` uniform shell '' .",
    "we define the average value as : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the effective mass density in the observer frame and the integrals are defined from the origin to a radius at which the lorentz factor takes the maximal value .",
    "the evolution of the average lorentz factor @xmath110 for the nrs and the rrs cases is shown in figure [ fig : glob_n ] and [ fig : glob_r ] ( thick line ) respectively .",
    "the lorentz factors increase linearly with time .",
    "the average internal energy and the mass density in the observer frame are shown in figure [ fig : pulse_max ] .",
    "@xmath47 is a good indicator to the transition from the acceleration stage to the coasting stage .",
    "the mass density equals the internal energy density at @xmath111 ( see figure [ fig : pulse_max ] ) .",
    "after the fireball uses up all the internal energy at @xmath47 , it coasts with a lorentz factor @xmath45 ( see figures [ fig : glob_n ] and [ fig : glob_r ] ) . in the rrs case",
    "the shell has a frozen radial profile through this stage , while in the nrs case the frozen pulse approximation breaks down at @xmath25 and the shell begins to expand before the ism has most of the system energy at @xmath104 ( see figure [ fig : pulse_comp ] ) .",
    "we can see the transition of the scaling laws of the density and the pressure at @xmath25 in figure [ fig : pulse_max ] .",
    "in the rrs case the reverse shock becomes relativistic at @xmath41 before it crosses the shell at @xmath44 . from this moment",
    "onwards the lorentz factor of the coasting shell is reduced considerably after the passage of the reverse shock .",
    "figure [ fig : rs_pro ] shows the deceleration by a relativistic reverse shock .",
    "there are four regions in the figure : the ism , the shocked ism , the shocked shell and the unshocked shell , which are separated by the forward shock ( fs ) , the contact discontinuity ( cd ) and the reverse shock ( rs ) .    using the shocks jump conditions and the equality of the pressure and the velocity at the contact discontinuity",
    ", we can estimate the lorentz factor of the shocked region , @xmath112 , and the lorentz factor of the reverse shock , @xmath113 , for a planner geometry ( sari & piran , 1995 ) , @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "the quantities just ahead of ( or just behind ) the reverse shock are denoted by the subscript 4 ( or 3 ) . for spherical geometry , the pressure is not constant in the shocked region bounded by the two shocks .",
    "the ratio @xmath116 in the above equations should be replaced with @xmath117 . however , in our simulations , @xmath118 is a factor of a few at most .",
    "then , equation ( [ eq : gamma_2 ] ) can roughly explain the numerical result .",
    "the time it takes for the reverse shock to cross a distance @xmath119 in the shell material is @xmath120 . as the reverse shock compresses the shell material , the width @xmath119 becomes @xmath121 after the shock passes through it .",

    "figures [ fig : stab ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) depict the flow profiles as functions of @xmath64 for the perturbation of @xmath15 , @xmath106 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines are the initial profile ( self similar solution + perturbation ) , and the solid lines are at @xmath164sec later .",
    "the density perturbation ( figure [ fig : stab ] ( a ) ) does not effect other quantities ( @xmath106 and @xmath14 ) and it does not propagate in the local fluid frame .",
    "we use the self similar solution to estimate the evolution of @xmath165 of the fluid element in the perturbed region ( or any other fluid element ) . taking the derivative of @xmath165 along its line of flow",
    "we get @xmath166 so that a fluid element which had been at @xmath167 at a time @xmath168 , will be at @xmath169 . the fluid element which had a density @xmath170 at @xmath168 ,",
    "will have a density @xmath171 .",
    "the ratio between the density perturbation @xmath172 and the unperturbed value @xmath173 is constant in time , but the perturbation will depart from the forward shock as @xmath174 and the perturbation becomes less important as @xmath175 .",
    "our numerical results agree well with these scalings .",
    "a velocity perturbation ( figure [ fig : stab ] ( b ) ) induces pressure and density perturbations .",
    "the pulse of the coupled perturbations is decomposed after a short time into two pulses : an outgoing compression pulse ( outgoing motion corresponds to a decreasing @xmath64 ) and an ingoing rarefaction pulse ( a rarefaction wave and a shock wave ) .",
    "these waves propagate with the speed of sound in the local fluid frame @xmath176 .",
    "the speed of the outgoing and the ingoing sound wave in the observer frame are @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively . assuming that the initial position @xmath167 of the perturbation at a time @xmath168 is not too far from the forward shock , @xmath179 , we get the position of the outgoing pulse @xmath180 .",
    "the pulse reaches the forward shock at @xmath181 and it boosts the forward shock . the position of the ingoing pulse can not be expressed by a simple analytic formula , but it departs from the forward shock much faster than a density perturbation . after the out - going pulse boosts the forward shock , the flow profile is almost the self similar one .",
    "a pressure perturbation ( figure [ fig : stab ] ( c ) ) also induces perturbations in @xmath106 and @xmath15 .",
    "the perturbations consist of three components , two propagating component and a standing density perturbation . after an outgoing compression pulse and an ingoing shock propagate",
    ", a density perturbation still stays at the position where the initial pressure perturbation was ( in the local fluid frame ) .",
    "the ingoing shock leaves the forward shock quickly .",
    "the density perturbation departs from the forward shock as discussed earlier .",
    "the outgoing pulse is basically the same one appearing in the case of an initial velocity perturbation .",
    "the pulse boosts the forward shock and at this stage the profile is almost the self similar one .",
    "we have explored numerically the evolution of a relativistic fireball interacting with a uniform ism , through the stages of initial acceleration , coasting , energy transfer to the ism and the deceleration .",
    "these calculations begin when the fireball is at rest .",
    "they follow the acceleration to a relativistic velocity and the subsequent slowing down to a velocity far below the speed of light .",
    "these calculations span more than eight orders of magnitudes in the size of the fireball .",
    "the current analytic understanding of the fireball evolution can explain well our numerical results .",
    "initially , the lorentz factor increases linearly with the radius during the initial free acceleration stage . at @xmath47",
    "the fireball has transfered all its initial radiation energy to kinetic energy and it coasts .",
    "then the energy is transfered to the ism .",
    "this takes place at @xmath182 for the nrs case , or at @xmath127 for the rrs case .",
    "after that the shocked ism carries most of the initial energy of the fireball .",
    "the profile of the shocked ism is then described well by the relativistic self similar blandford - mckee solution .",
    "the forward shock decelerates as @xmath183 and it becomes newtonian at @xmath71 . after that the non - relativistic self similar sedov - taylor solution sets in .",
    "we have shown that the relativistic self similar solution is an excellent approximation , down to @xmath0 and a reasonable approximation even down to @xmath1 .",
    "we have also examined the transition into the relativistic self similar solution , and the transition from this solution to the non - relativistic self similar solution .    with the spherical code , we have shown that the hydrodynamical profiles of the shocked ism approaches to the relativistic self similar solution at the end of the coasting stage , even though the initial conditions of the simulation do not have self similar profiles .",
    "it implies that the relativistic self similar solution is attractive and stable for a spherical perturbation .",
    "we have tracked the evolution of the spherical density , velocity and pressure perturbations to the relativistic self similar solution in order to verify the stability of this solution .",
    "the blandford - mckee solution is the basis of much of the grb afterglow theory .",
    "it is used to obtain an explicit expression for the radial profile during the deceleration stage .",
    "we have shown that this model is reasonable even down to @xmath1 .",
    "it is also valid even in the case of a radial inhomogeneity in the ism .",
    "though the results presented in this paper are intended as a more general explanation of the strong explosion problem rather than a detailed fits of the grb afterglow , comparisons of the numerically predicted light curves based on this computations in detailed realistic models with the recent and upcoming observations will enable us to determine free parameters in the grbs model that can not be calculated from first principles , such as the total energy of the system , the surrounding density , the fraction of the energy that is given by the shocks to electrons or to the magnetic field .",
