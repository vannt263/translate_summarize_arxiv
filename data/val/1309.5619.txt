    "there has been major interest in thermoelectric energy conversion @xcite .",
    "an important application is converting wasted thermal energy into , say , useful and storable electrical one .",
    "also , deriving electricity from the more easily available thermal energy in remote environments is often relevant .",
    "@xcite thermoelectric cooling is a real possibility .",
    "obviously , there exist rigid thermodynamic limitations to such processes . however , the efficiency of existing devices is severely further limited by material and device properties , @xcite so that getting a sizable fraction of the thermodynamic carnot efficiency ( especially with a reasonable power ) is still an unattained goal .",
    "a key idea in this connection is that of trying to obtain a  strongly - coupled \" thermoelectric , @xcite in which there would be a well - defined ratio between electrical and thermal current .",
    "mahan and sofo @xcite suggested a way to achieve that , for electrons , by funneling the electrical transport to a very narrow energy - band .",
    "the deviation from the ideal carnot efficiency would then be determined by ",
    "parasitic \" effects , such as the small width of the above - mentioned electronic band and the non - electronic thermal conductivity .    for definiteness , we shall consider here cooling in a two - terminal electronic setup , whose terminals are kept at different temperatures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and different chemical potentials , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the total entropy production of the electrons in such a device is @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the rate of energy change in the @xmath6 reservoir , @xmath7 is _ minus _ the particle current leaving that reservoir , and @xmath8 is the heat current entering it .",
    "current conservation implies @xmath9 , and energy conservation requires @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite consequently , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the heat current and @xmath13 is the particle current leaving the left reservoir .",
    "assuming for concreteness that the left terminal is to be cooled , then @xmath14 and the working conditions for a thermoelectric refrigerator configuration are positiveness of the used power @xmath15 @xmath16 ( @xmath17 being the charge of the carriers and @xmath18 is the voltage drop ) and positiveness of the cooling power @xmath19 , @xmath20 the efficiency @xmath21 of the cooling process ( sometimes called  coefficient of performance \" ) is defined as the ratio between the cooling power and the used one ; it is advantageous to express it in terms of the entropy production [ see eq .",
    "( [ sdot1 ] ) ] i.e. , the dissipation @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the carnot efficiency for cooling , @xmath24 ; in our setup it is given by @xmath25 several physical remarks on the dissipation are called for here .",
    "the total entropy of the world must not decrease .",
    "usually , for example , the ohmic part of the dissipation occurs in the resistor connecting the two reservoirs . in the two - terminal landauer - type formulation",
    "used here , there is no reservoir taking the heat off that resistor .",
    "the dissipation occurs in the two reservoirs @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xcite the charge carriers exiting or entering these reservoirs are supposed to equilibrate ( usually by the unmentioned electron - electron , or electron - phonon interactions ) in the huge reservoirs .",
    "the interesting question of how the dissipation is divided between the two reservoirs has been recently introduced and discussed in ref .  .",
    "it is found that the dissipation occurs symmetrically in the two reservoirs only in the limit of full electron - hole symmetry ( i.e. , when the energy - dependent conductivity or transmission of the junction is symmetric around the average chemical potential ) and then the thermopower vanishes .",
    "the larger is this asymmetry ( and the thermopower ) the more asymmetric is the distribution of the dissipation between the two reservoirs .",
    "thus the thermopower and the asymmetry of the dissipation are monotonic functions of one another !",
    "we will come back to this interesting question in sec .",
    "[ dissa ] .    equation ( [ ef ] ) suggests that a vanishing dissipation can lead to a full carnot efficiency , @xmath28 .",
    "this is indeed true , but , as is well - known , in that limit _ both the used and the cooling power will also vanish_. this happens for a junction obeying time - reversal symmetry ; breaking it modifies this conclusion .",
    "@xcite one might be tempted to consider the possibility that the two terms forming the dissipation , eq .",
    "( [ sdot1 ] ) , cancel one another while each remains finite .",
    "this might have been possible , since the thermal part of the dissipation , @xmath29 , is in fact negative ( the cooling heat current flows against the temperature drop ) .",
    "however , the above is only apparent : at the zero - dissipation limit all currents and input / output powers vanish .",
    "one might have hoped to overcome this caveat by breaking time - reversal symmetry ; however , at least in a landauer - type formulation , it has been shown @xcite that there are in fact strong limitations ( beyond the carnot one ) on @xmath30 . nevertheless , if one considers , as we shall do here , a system very close ( characterized by a small parameter @xmath31 ) to the ideal limit of carnot efficiency , both the used and the cooling powers will vanish proportional to @xmath31 , while the dissipation will vanish like @xmath32 .    to appreciate this point , it is instructive to relate the dissipation to the properties of the onsager matrix @xmath33 , which connects the currents and the thermodynamic  driving \" forces ( sometimes called affinities ) , @xmath34={\\cal m } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c}(\\mu^{}_{l}-\\mu_{r}^{})/(et^{}_{r } ) \\\\ ( 1/t^{}_{r})-(1/t^{}_{l})\\end{array}\\right ]",
    "\\ .\\label{onsager}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the linear - response regime @xmath33 does not depend on the driving forces and is determined by the equilibrium properties of the setup .",
    "( for a system invariant to time - reversal the matrix @xmath33 is symmetric . )",
    "the dissipation , eq .",
    "( [ sdot1 ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath35\\frac{{\\cal m}}{t^{}_{r } } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c}\\frac{\\mu^{}_{l}-\\mu_{r}^{}}{e } \\\\ \\\\",
    "-\\eta^{-1}_{\\rm c}\\end{array}\\right ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the onsager matrix @xmath33 is positive definite , it follows that the dissipation vanishes when the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath33 is zero .",
    "a 2@xmath362 symmetric matrix whose determinant is zero is necessarily of the form @xmath37\\ .         \\ ] ] such a matrix implies that the charge and the heat currents are proportional to one another .",
    "this was termed by kedem and caplan @xcite  strong coupling \" .",
    "the strong - coupling configuration is the limit of the  best thermoelectric \" of mahan and sofo .",
    "@xcite thus , if one could achieve the ideal limit of refs .   and  ,",
    "the  driving force \" vector @xmath38 would be proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "one would then get the carnot efficiency , but both currents would vanish , along with _ zero power in the linear - response regime . _",
    "mahan and sofo @xcite achieved the strong - coupling configuration by channeling the electronic transport into an infinitely - narrow band .",
    "there , ( see also ref .   ) the onsager matrix ( again limited to electronic processes ) takes the form @xmath40\\ , \\label{jhjm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the common temperature of the setup , @xmath42 is the conductance , and @xmath43 is essentially the _",
    "unique , well - defined , _ energy transferred by each charge carrier between the two terminals . in real life there are always ",
    "parasitic \" effects , such as phonon heat conductivity , transport in a finite - width energy band , more energy channels , _ etc . _ as we have now just discovered , such  parasitics \" can be _",
    "crucial for the operation of thermoelectric heat conversion !",
    "_ one is thus led to consider what these parasitics do to the dissipation , to the power , and to the efficiency .",
    "from this line of reasoning it follows that we need to consider the situation when the ( nonnegative ) determinant of the onsager matrix is positive , but still very small .",
    "@xcite in the configuration of refs .   and   the two - terminal setup is further connected to a non - electronic _ thermal _ terminal , which exchanges energy with the electronic system .",
    "the onsager matrix becomes a 3@xmath363 one , @xmath44 , which is still singular ( as the electronic transport occurs via a single channel ) .",
    "the 2@xmath362 onsager matrix obtained from it when the energy flow between the electronic junction and the thermal contact is blocked is singular as well .",
    "however , adding to the picture the phonon heat currents and the corresponding conductances , and the various transport coefficients due to elastic and inelastic ( electronic ) processes @xcite makes the determinant of @xmath44 , and consequently also that of the 2@xmath362 one obtained from it , finite .",
    "we show below that when time - reversal symmetry holds , the effect of all these parasitic processes on the maximal efficiency and the cooling and used powers can be described by a single ( small ) parameter  the deviation of @xmath45 $ ] from zero .",
    "moreover , the functional dependence of the maximal efficiency and the dissipation on that parameter are different : the total dissipation is affected far less than the efficiency .    in sec .",
    "[ calc ] we present the details of the calculations .",
    "the analysis of the optimum driving - force vectors and the eigenvectors of the onsager matrix is presented in section [ vec ] .",
    "the question of the symmetry of the dissipation ( its distribution between the two reservoirs ) and its relation to the thermopower @xcite is further discussed in sec .",
    "[ dissa ] , together with our conclusions .",
    "we display the general results , when time - reversal symmetry may not hold .",
    "it is straightforward to have in mind the more usual case , when it holds and the discussion is simpler .",
    "as is explained above , the dissipation can vanish when the determinant of the onsager matrix @xmath33 is zero . in order to study the efficiency and the optimal driving forces at small dissipation",
    ", we introduce a parameter which  measures \" the distance of the determinant from the strong - coupling limit condition @xmath46 when time - reversal symmetry holds the onsager matrix is symmetric , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the figure of merit . in that case",
    "@xmath49 . these bounds on @xmath31 persist also when @xmath33 is not symmetric , with @xmath50 .",
    "however , when that ratio is negative ( the example considered below will be @xmath51 ) then @xmath31 exceeds 1 .",
    "namely , a setup lacking time - reversal symmetry and for which @xmath52 is always far away from the strong - coupling limit .    adding a notation for the deviation of @xmath33 from complete symmetry @xmath53 the positiveness of the onsager matrix , @xmath54 , imposes a relation between @xmath31 and the asymmetry parameter",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56 [ for a time - reversal invariant system , @xmath57 and condition ( [ conda1 ] ) is always satisfied . ] with this parametrization of the onsager matrix , to which we add for convenience @xmath58 we obtain for the cooling power @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] , and for the used power @xmath61\\big ) \\ . \\label{w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , when @xmath62 is positive , both used and cooling powers are positive for @xmath63 while if it is negative then the voltage drop @xmath18 must be negative as well , with @xmath64 finally , the efficiency is @xmath65}\\ .\\label{eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the efficiency is optimized for a given @xmath66 , by controlling @xmath67 , the ratio of the two components of the driving - force vector . to do that ,",
    "we first show in fig .",

    "the mathematical function of the efficiency has a  pole \" at @xmath70 and a zero at @xmath71 it is large in the non - physical region on the left of the pole and negative between the pole and the zero .",
    "we emphasize that although the efficiency can be larger in the non - physical regions , we have to choose the maximum within the physical domain , given by eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) . the plots in fig .",

    "finally , the total dissipation at optimal efficiency is @xmath88 hence we see that as a time - reversal symmetric junction ( @xmath57 ) approaches the strong - coupling limit , its efficiency , cooling power , and the used power all deviate from the ideal limit as @xmath31 ; the total dissipation , however , deviates much more weakly from zero , as @xmath89 , due to the cancellation of the @xmath31 term between the thermal and the electrical dissipations .",
    "the effect of time - reversal symmetry breaking ( for a positive ratio of the two off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath33 ) is examined in figs .",

    "the treatment of the heat exchange between transport electrons and an electron reservoir is based on the principle that a particle with an energy @xmath43 exiting ( entering ) a large system extracts from ( delivers to ) it a heat @xmath105 and an entropy @xmath106 given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the chemical potential in the reservoir .",

    "( [ onsager ] ) ] .",
    "the seebeck thermopower @xmath120 is then given by @xmath121 .",
    "we consider here only the case where time - reversal symmetry prevails .",
    "the first crucial observation here from eq . ( [ heat ] ) is the well - known one that in order to have nonzero thermoelectric response , @xmath111 must have an odd component as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "next , we note that if such ",
    "electron - hole ( @xmath123 ) symmetry breaking \" exists , the two powers @xmath124 are each linear in @xmath18 .",
    "however , by adding them , one finds that the total dissipation ( heat generated per unit time ) is indeed ( see ref .   ) the good old joule heating , @xmath125 , which is second - order in @xmath18 ( @xmath126 is the net electrical current ) .    the novel observation of ref .",
    "is that it is the same symmetry breaking which also leads to an _ asymmetry of the dissipation between the two reservoirs_. in fact , by subtracting eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , one readily obtains , to order @xmath18 , @xmath127 thus the dissipation asymmetry and the thermopower are proportional to one another , at least within linear response .",
    "the physical reason for this is clear : within linear response , the energy flow from , say , @xmath26 to @xmath27 , which differs by just a constant from the heat flow , can be regarded as less energy ( and heat ) dumped in @xmath26 , and more dumped in @xmath27 .",
    "this transfers energy from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the heat flow / dissipation asymmetry , while small for weak @xmath123 symmetry breaking , is first order in v. the total dissipation , which exists also with that symmetry valid , is second order  i.e",
    ". much smaller ! as shown in ref .",
    ", this thermopower  dissipation - asymmetry relationship can be used to determine the former quantity by measuring the latter .",
    "we note that when the seebeck coefficient , @xmath128 , vanishes the dissipation is symmetric and independent of the nature of the two reservoirs ( and of any asymmetry between them ) .",
    "although in linear response the currents are odd in @xmath18 , the dissipation _ in each reservoir _ is not .",
    "in fact , by subtracting eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) for @xmath26 , with @xmath18 and @xmath129 , it is found @xcite that , e , g . @xmath130 as well .",
    "these relationships should hold for any meso- and nano- scale system , including molecular bridges .",
    "they were confirmed by both electronic - structure numerical computations and by experiments using an innovative nano - scale temperature detection.@xcite    we conclude by discussing some simple particular cases , demonstrating the relevance to our main subject in the present paper  the case of small dissipation .",
    "having full @xmath123 symmetry is of no interest here , since both @xmath120 and the dissipation asymmetry vanish .",
    "a very interesting case is that a almost full @xmath123 symmetry breaking , when almost all charge carriers are e.g. electrons . a simple realisation of this is a narrow lorentzian resonance of width @xmath131 much above the fermi level ( i.e when its center energy @xmath132 satisfies @xmath133 ) . in the low - temperature and narrow - resonance limit",
    "this becomes the strong - coupling configuration @xcite or ` best ' @xcite thermoelectric , having a singular transport matrix .",
    "the system then has vanishing dissipation and power .",
    "the new insight gained from the thermopower  dissipation - asymmetry relationship is that the dissipation is negative in one terminal and positive in the other , such that they fully cancel each other ( while heat is still carried by the electron current from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) .",
    "a finite width of the resonance , or a low but significant temperature will create the almost singular transport matrix discussed in this paper .",
    "a more complicated case is that of a mobility edge far above the fermi level .",
    "again , most charge carriers will be electrons .",
    "this case was treated in refs .   and  , and sizeable values of the seebeck coefficient @xmath120",
    "were indeed found .",
