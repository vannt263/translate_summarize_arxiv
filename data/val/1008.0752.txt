    ", the nonlinear term of the navier - stokes equation plays an important role , and it generates vertical vorticity resulting in three - dimensional patterns and the associated secondary oscillatory patterns  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will study various patterns and chaos for zero - prandtl number convection using bifurcation analysis .",
    "we use direct numerical simulations and a low - dimensional model for this purpose .",
    "low - prandtl number fluids , for example , mercury ( @xmath6 ) , liquid sodium ( @xmath7 ) , solar plasma in the convective zone ( @xmath8 ) , exhibit interesting convective patterns and chaos @xcite . in terrestrial experiments , the prandtl number can not go below that of liquid sodium ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , the visualization of flow patterns inside low - p fluids like mercury and sodium is quite difficult . due to these limitations of experiments ,",
    "numerical simulations are very significant in the study of low - p and zero - p convection .",
    "the numerical work of @xcite indicate that the properties of low - p convection as @xmath10 are quite close to that of zero - p convection .",
    "hence low - p convection as @xmath10 appears to approach zero - p convection as a limiting case .",
    "therefore , zero - p convection is very useful for understanding the properties of low - p convection .",
    "even though numerical analysis of zero - p convection is quite tricky due to its inherent instabilities near the onset , it provides certain advantages .",
    "for @xmath11 the thermal modes are slaved to the velocity modes , hence the number of independent variables are less than those required for low - p analysis .",
    "also , the time steps for numerical simulations of very low - p convection could be very small due to the stiffness of the equations , which is not a limitation for zero - p convection @xcite .",
    "these features led us to investigate zero - p convection in detail for understanding the convective patterns and chaos in low - p fluids .",
    "@xcite was one of the first to simulate zero - p convection for free - slip and no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "he reported various supercritical oscillatory instabilities , regular and chaotic patterns , etc .  in his simulations .",
    "the patterns observed by thual are two - dimensional rolls , periodic and quasiperiodic rolls , squares , travelling waves , etc . for low - p fluids",

    "these observations indicate that zero - p convection contains pertinent features of low - p convection .",
    "also , free - slip and no - slip boundary conditions exhibit similar convective flow patterns .",
    "the oscillatory instabilities , and regular and chaotic patterns found in numerical simulations have also have been observed in convection experiments on mercury , air , and liquid sodium @xcite .",
    "some of the most commonly observed patterns in experiments are stationary , periodic , quasiperiodic , chaotic , and travelling rolls , as well as squares , asymmetric squares , and phase locked states .",
    "chaotic rolls have been observed to appear through both period doubling and quasiperiodic routes in some of these experiments .",
    "convection experiments of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and numerical simulations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite indicate the presence of oscillatory instability of the two - dimensional convective rolls and the resultant stable wavy rolls .",
    "busse and coworkers  @xcite showed using perturbative analysis that the two - dimensional rolls become unstable to oscillatory three - dimensional disturbances when the amplitude of the convective motion exceeds a finite critical value . according to @xcite , the condition for the instability takes the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the critical rayleigh number for the onset of convection , and @xmath16 is the rayleigh number where oscillatory instability starts .",

    "in a related work , @xcite investigated the origin of instabilities in low - p convection using phase dynamical equations and argued that the instability always saturates into travelling waves . in the present paper we will explore the origin of oscillatory instability using numerical simulations and bifurcation theory .",
    "origin of plethora of convective patterns observed in convective experiments and numerical simulations can be quite intricate .",
    "each run of a convective simulation takes significantly long time , so it is not possible to scan the parameter space minutely for deciphering detailed bifurcation scenario .",
    "experiments too have their complexities and limitations .",
    "the large number of modes present in simulations and experiments tend to obscure the underlying dynamics .",
    "these difficulties are circumvented by a powerful and complimentary approach in which the system is analyzed using an appropriately constructed low - dimensional model .",
    "relatively low computational cost for running low - dimensional models , and the ease of construction of the bifurcation diagrams are some of the distinct advantages of these models compared to the experiments and simulations",
    ". however care must be taken to take all the relevant modes of the system for constructing the low - dimensional models .",
    "number of active modes near the onset of convection is not very large , so low - dimensional models consisting of these active modes are very useful for analyzing this regime .",
    "@xcite showed using a 6-mode model of zero - p convection that the growth of the 2d rolls saturate through the generation of vertical vorticity ( wavy nature ) .",
    "@xcite observed critical bursting in the above model during the saturation .",
    "@xcite explained the mechanism of selection of the square patterns using a 15-mode model of the zero - p rbc .",
    "recently @xcite constructed a 13-mode model using the energetic modes of dns , and performed a bifurcation analysis using the model and simulation results . using the bifurcation diagram",
    ", @xcite could explain the origin of squares ( sq ) , asymmetric squares ( asq ) , oscillating asymmetric squares ( oasq ) , relaxation oscillations with an intermediate square regime ( sqor ) , and three kinds of chaotic attractors .",
    "in addition , the above patterns were observed in both dns and models .",
    "earlier @xcite had observed sq and sqor patterns in his simulations .",
    "@xcite studied the transition from 2d rolls to square patterns in rbc for different prandtl numbers using analytical tools .",
    "@xcite studied the stability of the sq patterns using a complementary procedure called the amplitude equations .",
    "a major limitation of the 13-mode model of @xcite was the absence of wavy rolls near the onset .",
    "this limitation is overcome by extending this model to a 27-mode model by incorporating the corresponding dominant modes . in the present paper",
    "we perform a bifurcation analysis of this model and explore the origin of the various convective patterns of zero - p convection with special emphasis on the oscillatory instability and related wavy roll patterns .",
    "all the features of the 13-mode model are reproduced in the 27-mode model by construction .",
    "we will show in our discussion that properties of the wavy rolls of the 27-mode model matches reasonably well with those observed in experiments and simulations .",

    "[ fig : modes_lowdim ] are active for these convective patterns . the bifurcation diagram bif - c has been generated by setting these modes as nonzero and all other modes as zero .",

    "the unstable limit cycle originating from cb2 has a time period around @xmath123 in units of @xmath17 ( viscous time scale ) .",
    "subsequent periodic , quasiperiodic , and chaotic time series have time scales comparable to the above value since their origin is closely connected to the bifurcation cb2 at @xmath59 in bif - c .",
    "our preliminary calculations indicate that the time period of oscillations for these patterns are within a factor of 10 from this value for @xmath59@xmath124 .",
    "earlier @xcite observed time - dependent wavy rolls in her convection experiments on mercury ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "she observed multiple peaks with the time period ranging from 0.1 to 1 in the time units of @xmath17 ( see fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "krishnamurti s experimental value for the time - scale of the chaotic wavy rolls is in the same range as our theoretical time - scale estimated above .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the time period of the oscillatory rolls using their experimental data for air ( @xmath126 ) to be around 1 in the units of @xmath17 . using numerical simulations , @xcite observed time periods of oscillatory rolls to be around @xmath127@xmath128 in the units of @xmath129 for @xmath126 .",
    "@xcite found the period of the wavy oscillations to be around 0.065 viscous time units for @xmath130 .",
    "these results are in general agreement ( within a factor of 10 ) with our theoretical finding based on the bifurcation analysis .",
    "note that @xcite reported that the time period of the oscillatory instability in the units of @xmath17 is independent of the prandtl number .",
    "hence the time - scales are not expected to vary appreciably even when we change the prandtl number by an order of magnitude which is consistent with the results for mercury ( @xmath125 ) and air ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "therefore , a comparison of our results for @xmath11 with those obtained for finite @xmath2 is also justified .",
    "oscillatory instabilities and their saturation through critical bursting have been studied by kumar and coworkers @xcite using several low - dimensional models .",

    "in conclusion , we explored various flow patterns of zero - p convection and performed a detailed bifurcation analysis near the onset using direct numerical simulation and a 27-mode low - dimensional model .",
    "the low - dimensional model was constructed using the most energetic modes of dns .",
    "the results of the dns and the low - dimensional model are in good agreement with each other .",
    "several new chaotic attractors and windows of periodic and quasiperiodic rolls have been reported for the first time for zero - p convection .",
    "the origin and dynamics of all the observed patterns have been explained successfully using the bifurcation diagrams .",
    "the rbc system for @xmath11 is chaotic at the onset itself .",
    "the stability analysis of the 27-mode model indicates three codimension-2 bifurcation points that play critical roles in the dynamics of convection near the onset .",
