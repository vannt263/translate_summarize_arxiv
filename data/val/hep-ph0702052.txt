    "[ fig:1 ] , right ) .",
    "while this separation is valid at leading order ( lo ) in qcd perturbation theory , the two processes are intimately linked at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) through the mandatory factorization of a collinear singularity , that arises from the splitting of the photon into a quark - antiquark pair and induces a mutual logarithmic factorization scale dependence in both processes . in close analogy to deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering , one can define a photon structure function f_2^(q^2)&=&_q 2 x e_q^2f_q/(q^2)+c_qf_q/(q^2 ) + c_gf_g/(q^2 ) + e_q^2c_that is related to the parton densities in the photon and has been measured in electron - positron collisions at lep .",
    "even the strong coupling constant @xmath0 that appears in the expression above can be determined rather precisely in fits to these data @xcite .",
    "a convenient modification of the @xmath1 factorization scheme consists in absorbing the point - like wilson coefficient c_(x)&=&2n_c c_g(x)=3 in the altarelli - parisi splitting function @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "while at lo hadronic jets are directly identified as final - state partons , their definition becomes subtle at higher orders , when several partons ( or hadrons ) can be combined to form a jet . according to the standardization of the 1990 snowmass meeting , particles",
    "@xmath3 are added to a jet cone @xmath4 with radius @xmath5 , if they have a distance @xmath6 from the cone center . however , these broad combined jets are difficult to find experimentally , so that several modifications ( mid - points , additional seeds , iterations ) have been successively applied by the various experiments . the deficiencies of the cone algorithm are remedied in the longitudinally invariant @xmath7 clustering algorithm , where one uses only the combination criterion @xmath8 for any pair of particles @xmath3 and @xmath9 . unfortunately , this algorithm scales numerically with the cubic power of the number @xmath10 of the particles involved . only recently",
    "a faster version has been developed making use of geometrical arguments and diagrammatic methods known from computational science @xcite .",
    "the publicly available fastjet code scales only with @xmath11 and is now rapidly adopted , in particular for the lhc , where the particle multiplicity is high .",
    "single ( inclusive ) jets benefit from high statistics and the presence of a single ( transverse ) energy scale @xmath12 , which makes them easily accessible experimentally and predictions for them theoretically stable .",
    "the @xmath12-distribution of the single - jet cross section can then be used to determine e.g.  the strong coupling constant from scaling violations , as shown in fig .",

    "f_a / a(x_a , m_a^2 ) x_b f_b / b(x_b , m_b^2 ) depends on the pseudorapidity of the second jet @xmath14 . in lo",
    "only two jets with equal transverse energies can be produced , and the observed momentum fractions of the partons in the initial electrons or hadrons @xmath15 equal the true momentum fractions @xmath16 .",
    "if the energy transfer @xmath17 is known , momentum fractions for the partons in photons @xmath18 can be deduced . in nlo , where a third jet can be present , the observed momentum fractions are defined by the sums over the two jets with highest @xmath12 , and they match the true momentum fractions only approximately .",
    "furthermore , the transverse energies of the two hardest jets need no longer be equal to each other .",
    "even worse , for equal @xmath12 cuts and maximal azimuthal distance @xmath19 the nlo prediction becomes sensitive to the method chosen for the integration of soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the theoretical cross section is then strongly scale dependent and thus unreliable .",
    "this sensitivity also propagates into the region of large observed momentum fractions .",
    "it is thus preferable to cut on the average @xmath20 .",

    "it is thus interesting to investigate the breakdown of factorization in kinematic regimes where direct or resolved processes dominate .",
    "this can either be done by measuring the dependence on the photon virtuality @xmath21 ( transition from virtual to real photons ) @xcite , @xmath12 ( direct processes are harder than resolved photons ) , or @xmath22 ( = 1 for direct processes at lo ) .",
    "the latter distribution is confronted in fig.[fig:4 ] with the hypothesis of no ( or global ) factorization breaking ( left ) and with a suppression factor @xmath23 of 0.34 @xcite applied to resolved processes only ( right ) .",
    "note that the inter - dependence of direct and resolved processes requires the definition of a new factorization scheme with suppression of the scale - dependent logarithm also in the direct contribution @xcite m(q^2,s ) _ & = & - p_q_i ( z)+q_i^22 s + & &  - p_q_i(z ) .",

    "if individual hadrons are experimentally identified , the cross sections above have to be modified to include convolutions over fragmentation functions @xmath25 . for light quarks and gluons , these non - perturbative , but universal distributions",
    "must be fitted to @xmath26 data , but then produce successful predictions for hera data at nlo . for heavy quarks , the fragmentation functions can in principle",
    "be calculated perturbatively , if the heavy - quark mass is kept finite ( `` fixed - order scheme '' ) , although they must for large @xmath12 be evolved using renormalization group equations ( for example at `` next - to - leading logarithm '' ) @xcite .",
    "an alternative method is to fit the fragmentation functions for @xmath27- and @xmath28-mesons again to @xmath26 data at large @xmath12 ( `` variable flavor number scheme '' ) .",
    "if in addition the finite mass terms are kept in the hard coefficient functions , one moves from a `` zero - mass scheme '' to a `` general - mass scheme '' and can achieve a smooth transition from large to small @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a comparison of both theoretical approaches to recent @xmath24+jet data from zeus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . while the massive calculation with central scale choice clearly underestimates the data , the variable flavor number scheme allows not only for direct , but also for resolved - photon contributions and tends to give a better description of the data over the full rapidity range .",
    "note that both predictions have been multiplied by hadronization corrections modeled with monte carlo simulations .",
    "while several calculations for inclusive single - hadron production with real photons are available , a theoretical investigation of the transition region to virtual photons and of the production of two hadrons , for example in the forward region , is still needed .",
    "direct and resolved contributions to the color - singlet and color - octet @xmath29 energy distribution in photoproduction at hera @xcite . ]",
    "the production of heavy quark - antiquark bound states is still far from being understood theoretically .",
    "while color - singlet ( cs ) states are to some extent formed already during hard collisions , their contribution has been shown to be both theoretically incomplete due to uncanceled infrared singularities as well as phenomenologically insufficient due to an order - of - magnitude discrepancy with the measured @xmath30-spectrum of @xmath29-mesons at the tevatron .",
    "on the other hand , non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) allows for a systematic expansion of the qcd lagrangian in the relative quark - antiquark velocity and for additional color - octet ( co ) contributions with subsequent color neutralization through soft gluons .",
    "@xmath29-production in photon - photon collisions at lep can then be consistently described @xcite , as can be the photoproduction data from hera in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . at hera ,",
    "the color - octet contribution becomes important only at small momentum - transfer @xmath31 of the photon to the @xmath29-meson .",
    "unfortunately , recent cdf data do not support the prediction of transverse polarization of the produced @xmath29-mesons at large @xmath30 as predicted from the on - shell fragmentation of final - state gluons within nrqcd , so that further experimental and theoretical studies are urgently needed .",
    "factorization of photoproduction of prompt photons . ]",
    "the production of prompt photons in association with jets receives contributions from direct and resolved initial photons as well as direct and fragmentation contributions in the final state as shown in fig.[fig:8 ] .",
    "photons produced via fragmentation usually lie inside hadronic jets , while directly produced photons tend to be isolated from the final state hadrons .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty coming from the non - perturbative fragmentation function can therefore be reduced if the photon is isolated in phase space . at the same time",
    "the experimental uncertainty coming from photonic decays of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 mesons is considerably reduced .",
    "photon isolation can be achieved by limiting the ( transverse ) hadronic energy @xmath35 inside a cone of size @xmath5 around the photon to e_(t)^had<_(t ) e_(t ) , .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "recently an improved photon isolation criterion _",
    "i e^had_(t),i ( -r_i ) <",
    "e_(t ) , , has been proposed , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is now the isolation cone @xcite .",
    "this procedure allows the fragmentation contribution to vanish in an infrared safe way .",
    "various distributions of photoproduction of prompt photons in association with jets as measured by h1 and compared to two different qcd calculations @xcite . ]",
    "photoproduction of prompt photons and jets has been measured by the h1 collaboration and compared with two qcd predictions , which differ in their inclusion of nlo corrections to the resolved and fragmentation contributions . only after modeling hadronization corrections and multiple interactions with monte carlo generators , the measured distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] agree with the qcd predictions , showing the particular sensitivity of photon final states to hadronic uncertainties .",
    "photoproduction processes have been abundantly measured at hera and stimulated many different theoretical studies , ranging from the investigation of the foundations of qcd as inscribed in its factorization theorems , over the determination of its fundamental parameter , the strong coupling constant , to improvements in our understanding of proton and photon structure as well as light and heavy hadron formation .    with the shutdown of hera on july 1 , 2007",
    ", many questions will remain unanswered , in particular in the diffractive and non - relativistic kinematic regimes , and this for quite some time until the eventual construction of a new electron - hadron collider such as erhic or an international linear collider .",
    "photon - induced processes in ultraperipheral heavy - ion collisions may offer a chance to continue investigations in this interesting field , opening in addition a window to nuclear structure , if these processes can be experimentally isolated .",
