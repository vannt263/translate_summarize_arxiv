    "recent _ chandra _ observations @xcite have yielded the first low - luminosity x - ray luminosity functions ( xlf ) of lmxbs for two typical old elliptical galaxies , ngc3379 and ngc4278 .",
    "the detection limit in these observations was @xmath0 , an order of magnitude lower than in most previous similar surveys , while the completeness limit was @xmath1 . in a followup study ,",
    "@xcite used multiple _",
    "chandra _ pointings to identify potential transient sources . in that work ,",
    "a _ transient candidate _ was defined as a source with x - ray luminosities varying by at least a factor of 10 , above the completeness limit , between different pointings .",
    "similarly a _ potential transient candidate _ was defined as a source with x - ray luminosities varying by at least a factor of 5 . using these definitions , 5 transient candidates and 3 additional potential transient candidates",
    "were identified in ngc3379 , while for ngc4278 the corresponding numbers were 3 and 3 respectively .",
    "@xcite conjectured that lmxbs in the field of ellipticals must be dominated by ns accreting from red giants .",
    "using analytical approximating formulae for the evolution of binary systems they estimated that such binaries are expected to be transient , with maximum recurrence times of @xmath2 , for at least 75% of their lifetimes .",
    "however , they limited their study only to lmxbs with red giant donors , and were unable to calculate the duration of the outburst phase or to predict how many transients would be identified in repeated _ chandra _ visits .",
    "@xcite presented results from extensive lmxb population synthesis ( ps ) simulations for ngc3379 and ngc4278 .",
    "they considered models for the formation and evolution of lmxbs from primordial and isolated field binaries with different common envelope efficiencies , stellar wind prescriptions , magnetic braking laws , and initial mass functions .",
    "they identified models that produce xlfs consistent with observations both in shape and normalization , suggesting that a primordial galactic field lmxb population can have a significant contribution to the total population of an elliptical galaxy .    in this letter",
    "we expand on the work by @xcite , and propose a physically motivated and self - consistent prescription for the modeling of transient lmxb properties .",
    "furthermore , we carry out monte carlo simulations to compare our findings to the recent observational work by @xcite . in ",
    "2 we describe briefly the ps models we use for the formation and evolution of field lmxbs . in ",
    "3 we expand on the detailed modeling of transient lmxbs and our comparison of ps models with observations .",
    "we show our results in   4 , and discuss the implication of our findings for transient lmxbs in   5 .",
    "the models presented in the study by @xcite were focused on lmxbs formed in the galactic field as products of the evolution of isolated primordial binaries .",
    "the simulations were performed using _ startrack _",
    "@xcite , an advanced ps code that has been tested against and calibrated using detailed mt calculations with stellar structure and evolution codes , and observations of binary populations . in the development of these models , all current knowledge about the stellar population in these galaxies",
    "were incorporated ( see tables 1 and 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the observationally determined parameters , such as their age ( @xmath3 ) and metallicity ( @xmath4=0.14 - 0.16 $ ] ) , or their total stellar mass ( @xmath5 ) , are similar for ngc3379 and ngc4278 .",
    "however , there are physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of a binary system , such as stellar winds , initial mass function , common envelope efficiency , magnetic braking and transient behavior , which are not fully understood quantitatively .",
    "therefore various prescriptions were used to model them .",
    "a total of 336 models were studied .",
    "see tables 3 and 4 in @xcite for all the model parameters and naming conventions .",
    "@xcite found that a small subset of their models produce xlfs in very good agreement with the observations , based on both the xlf shape and absolute normalization .",
    "they concluded that formation of lmxbs in the galactic field via evolution of primordial binaries _ can _ have a significant contribution to the total population of an elliptical galaxy , especially the gc poor ones such as ngc3379 @xcite . in our analysis here",
    ", we adopt their best - fitting model ( hereafter model @xmath6 ) , which produces the xlf in best agreement with observations .",
    "model @xmath6 assumes a moderate common envelope efficiency @xmath7 , a standard stellar wind prescription prescription ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnetic braking law derived by @xcite , and a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the lmxb population predicted by model @xmath6 has a significant contribution from transient systems , which with reasonable outburst dc can even dominate the xlf . as a consequence",
    "the xlf shape is rather sensitive to the treatment of these transient systems .",
    "@xcite showed that keeping the same ps parameters and changing _ only _ the modeling of transient sources leads to different xlfs .",
    "they tried different methods of modeling the outburst characteristics of transient lmxbs and got the best agreement with observations when they consider a variable dc for ns lmxb based on the binary properties , hereafter model @xmath8 .",
    "a constant low dc ( @xmath9 ) , hereafter model @xmath10 , was also statistically consistent with the observed xlf . in both cases ,",
    "the outburst luminosity was calculated as described in section 3.1 .",
    "in our models we keep track of all binary properties , including the mt rates , as a function of time for all accreting compact objects . here",
    "we focus only on ns lmxbs , which dominate the total population ( see fig .  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "we use the mt rate @xmath11 to identify transient sources in our simulation results . in the context of the thermal disk instability model , mass transferring binaries with mt rate lower than the critical rate @xmath12 for the thermal disk instability to develop @xcite ,",
    "are considered transient sources , meaning that they spend most of their life in quiescence ( @xmath13 ) , when they are too faint to be detectable , and they occasionally go into an outburst .",
    "the fraction of the time that they are in outburst ( @xmath14 ) defines their dc : @xmath15    the details of the thermal disk instability model are not well understood therefore the values of the outburst luminosity and the dc can not be calculated directly from first principles .",
    "a simple but physically motivated treatment is to assume that in the quiescent state the ns does not accrete any ( or accretes an insignificant amount of ) mass , and matter from the donor is accumulated in the disk . in the outburst state",
    "all this matter is accreted onto the ns emptying the disk .",
    "taking into account also that the x - ray luminosity probably can not exceed @xmath16 by more than a factor of 2 ( cf .",
    "* ) , we define the outburst luminosity as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass and the radius of the accretor , @xmath20 is the mass - loss rate of the donor and @xmath21 is correction factor that converts the bolometric luminosity to the observed _ chandra _ band .    in equation  [ lx_phys ] , dc is unknown .",
    "@xcite studied accretion disk models for dwarf novae which are thought to experience the same thermal disk instability .",
    "they found a correlation between the dc of the system and the rate at which the donor star is losing mass @xmath11 .",
    "the exact relation between these quantities depends on the disk s viscosity parameters , but the general behavior can be approximated by : @xmath22 plugging equation  ( [ dc ] ) into equation  ( [ lx_phys ] ) we eliminate the dc dependence and get an expression that depends only on quantities which are directly calculated in our ps modeling .",
    "the derivation of the critical mt rate @xmath12 for the thermal disk instability , comes from requiring that some part of the accretion disc has a temperature below the hydrogen ionization temperature . in the thin disk approximation",
    "the effective temperature decreases with increasing disk radius , so it is sufficient to require that the effective temperature at the outer edge of the disk is below the hydrogen ionization temperature . in x - ray binaries with ns accretors ,",
    "the surface temperature of the disk is regulated by irradiation from the accretor @xcite .    following the analysis presented by @xcite , we assume that the accretion disk around the ns extends up to a radius of 70% of the roche lobe radius of the ns ( @xmath23 ) , and that a transient ns lmxb is in the quiescent state until the surface density at the edge of the disk reaches the critical surface density    @xmath24    that will lead to instability @xcite . in equation  [ smax ]",
    "we assume a pure hydrogen disk with viscosity parameter @xmath25 , and no irradiation of the disk while the binary is in the quiescent state . for systems with helium accretion disks , such as lmxb with white dwarf donors ,",
    "we modify equation  [ smax ] accordingly ( see equation  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the maximum mass accumulated in the accretion disk , before the x - ray binary goes into outburst , is : @xmath26 from the equation above we can set an upper limit on the duration of the quiescent phase and the outburst . using the mass - loss rate of the secondary star ,",
    "as given by our ps models , and equations [ dc_def ] and [ dc ] , the time duration of the quiescent and outburst phase becomes : @xmath27      the probability that a transient lmxb is detected as a bright x - ray source is equal to its dc .",
    "however , the probability that a lmxb is identified as a transient source in a survey with multiple observations depends on the duration and the recurrence time of the outbursts of the source , as well as the time spacing between the observations . in our analysis",
    "we assume that a transient lmxb can be in two states , outburst or quiescent , and that its luminosity in outburst is given by equation  [ lx_phys ] , while in quiescence it is undetectable ( i.e. we do not take into account rise and decay characteristics of the outburst ) .",
    "hence , in order for a source to be identified as a transient , it has to be found at a different state , in at least one out of the multiple observations ( see figure  [ trans_fig ] ) .    given a model population of lmxbs",
    ", we calculate for each transient lmxb the probability that it would be identified as a transient source in an observational survey like the ones for the elliptical galaxies ngc3379 and ngc4278 @xcite . in order to estimate this probability ,",
    "we first calculate the outburst and recurrence time for the specific binary as described in section 3.2 , and then create an artificial lightcurve .",
    "this lightcurve should include at least one full cycle of the transient and be at least twice as long as the time interval between the first and the last observation .",
    "next , we choose randomly a time in this artificial light curve to position the first pointing of the survey with the other pointings following according to the time intervals between the pointing of the survey we are simulating .",
    "for this random positioning of the first pointing , we attain the state of the transient lmxb ( outburst or quiescent ) at each of the pointings , and assess whether this system would be identified as a transient source ( see figure  [ trans_fig ] ) .",
    "we repeat the procedure @xmath28 times , choosing randomly a different starting time in the artificial lightcurve , which enable us to estimate the probability that a specific system would be identified as a transient source .",
    "based on this probability for each transient lmxb of the model population , we perform another monte carlo simulation , this time to estimate the total number of transients that would be identified in the modeled survey . repeating this procedure @xmath28 times",
    ", we are able to derive a probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of identified transient sources , for a combination of ps and x - ray survey parameters .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we adopt the ps model @xmath6 , which was chosen based on comparison of the shape of the modeled xlf to the observed one @xcite .",
    "we examine two prescriptions for the transient characteristics of lmxbs : a variable dc based on the properties of each binary as described in section 3.1 ( model @xmath8 ) , and a low constant dc of 1% ( model @xmath8 ) . for more details on the model parameters see sections 2.3 and 3.1 in @xcite .",
    "we normalize the total number of lmxbs in our models in two different ways : based on the total stellar mass of the galaxy , or based on the number of observed lmxbs above the completeness limit of the observations .    in order to simulate the observational identification of transient sources as realistically as possible , for each of the two elliptical galaxies we use the actual time intervals between the successive pointings of the survey .",
    "furthermore , we try to mimic the definitions of transient candidate and potential transient candidate of @xcite . in our simulated observations ,",
    "a transient candidate is a system that is identified as transient and has outburst luminosity above @xmath29 , while a potential transient candidate has outburst luminosity between @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ transients ] shows the pdf for the number of detected sources in an x - ray survey such as that by @xcite .",
    "when we normalize the total number of lmxbs to the stellar mass of the the galaxy , model @xmath8 ( variable dc ) gives pdfs consistent with observations for both transient candidates and potential transient candidates , and for both galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "model @xmath10 ( constant dc @xmath31 ) is consistent with observations only when we look at the bright transient sources ( i.e. , transient candidates ) .",
    "a constant dc significantly overproduces the number of potential transient candidates .",
    "normalizing the total number of lmxbs of our models to the observed number of lmxbs above the completeness limit of the observation ( @xmath32 ) , for each of the two galaxies separately , alters our findings . in the case of ngc3379 , and for model @xmath8 , the pdfs of both transient candidates and potential transient candidates are now in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "this suggest that our models slightly overproduce lmxbs .",
    "this was already mentioned in @xcite , where the authors explained that the ps model normalization can be very sensitive to certain ps parameters , such as the distribution of the mass ratios between the initial masses of the two binary components . without a proper multi - dimensional coverage of the parameter space of at least thousands of models and",
    "given the uncertainties in the total galaxy mass , we can not use the total number of lmxbs as a formal constraint to a factor better than a few . for the case of ngc4278 on the other hand , normalizing our model population to the number of observed lmxbs results to a very high number of",
    "expected identified transient source , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "however , this does not come as a surprise , since the elliptical galaxy ngc4278 has a large number of gc ( @xmath33 times more than ngc3379 ) and a significant fraction of the observed lmxb population resides in gc .",
    "it has already been suggested that luminous gc lmxbs are predominantly persistent source @xcite in which case the similar number of identified transients in the two elliptical galaxies , despite the difference by a factor of @xmath34 in the total number of observed lmxbs , is expected .",
    "@xcite analyzed their model lmxb populations and found that the sub - populations that mainly contribute to the model xlfs are transient and persistent ns - lmxbs with red giant donors . following a similar analysis , in figure  [ transients_split ]",
    "we show again the pdf of the number of potential transient candidates for models @xmath8 and @xmath10 of the elliptical galaxy ngc3379 , but this time we split the modeled population into sub - populations based on the type of the donor star .",
    "we find that in model @xmath8 , the majority of identified transient sources are lmxbs with red giant donors , as already argued in the literature @xcite .",
    "in contrast , model @xmath10 predicts a much higher than the observed number of identified transient lmxbs and the majority of them have main sequence donors .",
    "this results from assigning the same low dc to all systems , whereas transient lmxbs with main sequence donors have usually mt rates close to @xmath35 .",
    "these systems would otherwise have @xmath36 and low outburst luminosity , and thus would be undetectable at x - ray luminosities above @xmath30 .",
    "the goal of this work was to pose further constraints on our models based on the recent observational work by @xcite , and simultaneously gain a better understanding on the nature of transient lmxbs .",
    "we found that the populations of transient lmxbs produced by the ps model @xmath8 @xcite is consistent with the observed population . in this model a variable dc",
    "was assigned for each system based on its properties ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "in contrast , we show that the widespread in the literature assumption of a constant low ( @xmath31 ) dc for all transients , although it can result in a xlf consistent with the observed one @xcite , is not consistent with the number of observationally identified transient lmxbs .",
    "while the two elliptical galaxies modeled here have very similar properties in terms of stellar mass , age , star formation history and metallicity , the major difference between the two is their specific gc frequency .",
    "ngc4278 has about 5 times more gc per unit mass compared to ngc3379 .",
    "@xcite using similar _",
    "chandra _ observing times for both galaxies , found that ngc4278 has @xmath37 times more lmxbs with luminosity above @xmath38 than ngc3379 .",
    "the excess of x - ray sources in ngc4278 can be attributed to the higher lmxb formation efficiency in gc , suggesting that for the gc - rich elliptical galaxies the formation of lmxbs in gc through dynamical interactions plays an important role . at the same time , the number of identified transient lmxbs is roughly the same in both elliptical galaxies . despite the small statistical sample of only two galaxies , it seems that the number of transient sources is proportional to the stellar mass of the galaxy rather than the number of its gc .",
    "the same argument is also supported by our ps models which only take into account lmxb formation through binary evolution of field primordial binaries . when we normalize the modeled lmxb population to either the stellar mass of the galaxy or to the number of observed lmxbs in the gc - poor galaxy ngc3379 , the predicted number of observable transient lmxbs is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that lmxbs formed through the evolution of primordial field binaries dominate the observed lmxb populations in gc - poor elliptical galaxies , while in gc - rich ellipticals the formation of lmxb through dynamical interactions in gc becomes more important .",
    "however , even in the latter case , the primordial field population has a significant contribution ."
