    "the ultimate structure of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is a key question in elementary particle physics .",
    "consequentially , after the recent discovery of a higgs particle at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , detailed measurements of its properties have become one of the main priorities of the lhc and future colliders .",
    "thus far , measurements of its couplings are consistent with those expected from the standard model ( sm ) . moreover , including the mass of the new particle in the global electroweak sm fit to precision observables now asserts the validity of the sm at the 0.1% level  @xcite . despite this",
    ", the sm can not yet be complete .",
    "one outstanding problem , which lies at the interface of cosmology with particle and nuclear physics , is to explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe : @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the baryon number ( entropy ) density . among the several proposed scenarios , electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg )",
    "is particularly interesting as it is inextricably tied to electroweak symmetry breaking ( for a recent review see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and therefore potentially subject to current and near - future collider probes of the scalar sector . at the same time ,",
    "current and future searches for the permanent electric dipole moments of atoms , molecules , and nucleons provide a powerful window on the cp - violation needed for baryon asymmetry generation .",
    "successful ewbg requires a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) that proceeds via bubble nucleation at temperatures @xmath3(100 gev ) and new sources of cp violation .",
    "cp - violating interactions at the bubble walls induce chiral asymmetries which bias rapid sphaleron processes in the unbroken phase to create non - zero baryon density .",
    "this baryon density subsequently diffuses into the broken phase where ewsb suppresses the rate of sphaleron transitions , freezing in a baryon asymmetry .",
    "if not sufficiently suppressed , the sphalerons will restore equilibrium by washing out the asymmetry altogether .",
    "the strength of the first - order ewpt necessary to avoid washout is generally characterized as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 scalar background field and @xmath7 is the critical temperature at which the free energies of the broken and unbroken phases become degenerate . in the sm",
    ", this condition can only be satisfied for values of the higgs mass far below the value indicated by the lhc .",
    "however , in extensions of the sm , with more complex scalar sectors , this condition for a strong first order ewpt ( sfoewpt ) can be readily met .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the viability of a sfoewpt in the simplest extension of the sm scalar sector involving one real gauge singlet scalar @xmath8 , dubbed the `` xsm '' , and analyze its implications for future , precision higgs studies ( for earlier studies of the ewpt dynamics and/or phenomenology of the xsm , see e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) . this scenario does not contain new sources of cp violation but , in its most general form , provides a framework for studying the generic characteristics of the ewpt in models with extra singlet scalars .",
    "it also falls within the class of higgs portal scenarios , in which the dominant connection between the sm and new physics sectors is through operators of the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "after ewsb , these operators induce mixing between @xmath8 and @xmath11 , giving rise to a pair of neutral mass eigenstates , @xmath12 . depending on their masses , the higgs",
    "portal operators can enable either new decay  @xcite or resonant di - higgs production  @xcite modes .    in our analysis , we consider the kinematic regime in which no new on - shell decay modes arise and di - higgs production is non - resonant . as a result , in order to probe the xsm scenario in this regime , precision measurements are required .",
    "first , mixing generates small deviations to higgs production rates .",
    "although current lhc measurements constrain deviations to roughly @xmath3(20% )  @xcite , future collider experiments such as the high - luminosity lhc ( hl - lhc ) , the international linear collider ( ilc ) , tlep , china electron positron collider ( cepc ) , and a 100 tev proton - proton collider , such as the very high energy lhc ( vhe - lhc ) or super proton proton collider ( sppc ) are expected to significantly improve the accuracy of these measurements .",
    "second , mixing can lead to significant deviations of the higgs trilinear self - coupling from its sm value , leading to potentially observable consequences for self - coupling studies .",
    "finally , the presence of another scalar state can be probed indirectly , by precision electroweak observables , and directly , by searches for singlet - like heavy higgs bosons in the low mass region , @xmath13 .",
    "we consider all these constraints as well as the projected sensitivity of future collider experiments .",
    "as higgs portal interactions can also enable the occurrence of a sfoewpt  @xcite , the aforementioned experimental signatures provide a link between collider phenomenology and phase transition dynamics . in our analysis , we rely on a combination of analytic and numerical methods to analyze the xsm ewpt and its phenomenological consequences .",
    "we first revisit analytic calculations of the strength , relying heavily on ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to gain intuition of the generic characteristics .",
    "then , up - dating that work , we rely on the cosmotransitions package  @xcite to calculate various aspects of the ewpt numerically .",
    "our strategy in this work is to ascertain where current and future collider searches would probe the sfoewpt - viable parameter space .",
    "our analysis indicates that a sfoewpt prefers large negative couplings associated with the @xmath9 higgs portal operator .",
    "as we discuss below , this preference biases the associated collider phenomenology towards large mass splittings between the scalar eigenstates in the region of small mixing angles while allowing for potentially significant reductions in the strength of the sm - like scalar self coupling .",
    "future precision measurements of the sm - like scalar signal strengths and self - coupling would , then , provide powerful probes of the sfoewpt - viable parameter space . in this respect",
    ", there appears to be considerable potential for observable deviations from purely sm - like higgs properties .",
    "moreover , direct searches for singlet - like scalars having sm - like higgs branching ratios but reduced signal strengths would provide an additional window on this scenario .",
    "combining such searches with precision higgs property measurements at future colliders could , thus , reveal the presence of scalar potential dynamics needed for preserving any baryon asymmetry produced during the ewsb era .",
    "our discussion of this analysis is organized as follows : in section ii , we establish our notations for the xsm model and discuss basic theoretical bounds .",
    "section iii describes our fit to the current higgs coupling measurements and study of future sensitivities of the hl - lhc , ilc , tlep , cepc , and vhe - lhc or sppc . in this section",
    ", we also present constraints from heavy sm - like higgs searches and electroweak precision observables . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the finite temperature effective potential and our analysis of the ewpt . in section",
    "v , we present our final comments and conclusions .",
    "we study a minimal extension of the sm scalar sector consisting of a single , gauge singlet , real scalar field s. the @xmath14 tree level potential for the higgs doublet @xmath11 and @xmath8 is given by @xmath15 the @xmath16 and @xmath17 parameters constitute the higgs portal which provides the only connection to the sm for the singlet scalar @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 parameters are self - interactions which , without the higgs portal , constitute a hidden sector .",
    "our notation here follows that of refs .",
    "@xcite , where no distinction is made between dimensionful and dimensionless couplings .",
    "modulo the @xmath16 and @xmath19 parameters , the potential has a @xmath21 symmetry that stabilizes the singlet scalar , enabling a dark matter interpretation symmetry is present before electroweak symmetry breaking , both scalar eigenstates are made unstable through mixing if @xmath22 . ] which has been studied by many previous authors , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , as these parameters play a large role in the strength of the ewpt , we retain them , thereby rendering @xmath8 incapable of simultaneously providing a successful dark matter candidate .    as we are interested in the general pattern of ewsb for non - vanishing temperatures , we let @xmath8 , as well as @xmath11 , take on a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , i.e. ,  @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the @xmath14 vevs .",
    "since @xmath25 also breaks @xmath21 symmetry , we choose it to be positive through a field redefinition ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the minimization conditions then allow us to express two of the potential parameters in eq .",
    "( [ totpot ] ) in terms of the @xmath14 vevs and other potential parameters as @xmath28 we find it useful to exchange these two mass dimension two parameters for those appearing on the rhs of eq .",

    "the elements of the tree level mass - squared matrix are given by @xmath29 with the corresponding mass eigenstates @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the more @xmath6-like ( singlet - like ) scalar .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath33 is most easily defined in terms of the mass eigenvalues , @xmath34 as @xmath35 here , we make several points .",
    "* we require that the @xmath6-like scalar eigenstate , @xmath31 , is the lighter eigenstate and identify it with the observed higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite , i.e. ,  we set @xmath36 .",
    "the couplings to all sm states are then rescaled by @xmath37 , which results in modifications to the production cross sections that can be constrained by measurements of higgs signal strengths .",
    "we explore these constraints in the next section .",
    "* the singlet - like scalar eigenstate , @xmath32 , receives its decay modes entirely from mixing , via the higgs portal couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 . as such",
    ", these parameters are also sensitive to collider searches for heavy sm - like higgs bosons . moreover , electroweak precision observables are sensitive to the presence of new heavy scalar states .",

    "the relation for the mixing angle @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ sin2theta ] ) implies a highly non - trivial bound on the higgs portal parameters and physical masses , @xmath39 which becomes more severe in the limit in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 are degenerate .    to avoid vacuum instability at @xmath14 , the potential in eq .",
    "( [ totpot ] ) must be bounded from below .",
    "this is imposed by requiring the positivity of the quartic coefficients along all directions in field space . along the @xmath40 ( @xmath2 )",
    "direction , this leads to the bound @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) while , along an arbitrary direction , this implies @xmath43 .    for viable ewsb , two conditions must be met .",
    "the first is that the determinant of the mass mixing matrix described in eq .",
    "( [ mixingm ] ) must be positive for @xmath44 , where @xmath7 is the critical temperature associated with the ewpt .",
    "this is true when @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the finite temperature vevs for @xmath44 .",
    "the second condition is that the electroweak minimum must be the absolute minimum at @xmath14 , which we impose numerically . +",
    "phenomenologically , current measurements of higgs couplings constrain the combinations of potential parameters that determine the singlet - like scalar mass eigenvalue , @xmath38 , and the mixing angle @xmath48 . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the kinematic regime in which no new scalar decay modes arise , i.e. ,  @xmath49 , where we remind the reader that we have defined @xmath50 .",
    "this scenario is particularly challenging experimentally and the strategy to probe it necessarily must include high precision measurements of higgs couplings .",
    "motivated by this , we study not only the current status of lhc measurements of higgs couplings but also projections for experiments at the hl - lhc , ilc , tlep , cpec , and vhe - lhc or sppc as well .",
    "moreover , we include in our analysis sm - like higgs searches in the low mass regime and electroweak precision observables .",
    "+ from eq .",

    "we then impose constraints on the mixing angle by performing a global @xmath57 fit to the current higgs data from both atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite using @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are the ( uncertainties in the ) observed signal rates .",

    "moreover , @xmath25 can vary significantly from its value at @xmath7 and , therefore , does not directly enter eq .",

    "( [ ptbehaviour ] ) , we expect that a sfoewpt will prefer negative values of @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is allowed to take on positive values as well due to the fact that its effect on the parameter @xmath126 is somewhat suppressed by a factor of @xmath150 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](g ) , a sfoewpt requires a large @xmath6 projection ( i.e. ,  value of @xmath151 ) , implying small @xmath152 .",

    ". however , such supercooling effects result in a further enhancement of ewpt strength by a factor of @xmath158 that is quite significant for some parameter space points .",
    "we now consider the phenomenological implications of a sfoewpt , concentrating first on the effect on the parameter space by subjecting the mixing angle to the more stringent , prospective hl - lhc and ilc bounds . in doing so",

    "we defer an analysis of discovery potential , corresponding to a value of @xmath37 differing from unity by more than five standard deviations , to future work . by concentrating on the prospective exclusion",

    "we observe a tendency for points to prefer larger masses and smaller mixing angles .",
    "specifically , in the case of the current lhc [ panel ( d ) ] , more than half the black points lie in the region @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this tendency is far more than necessary from any constraint from current collider bounds or electroweak precision observables , so we infer that it is ewpt - induced .    in order to understand this preference for values of @xmath38 near the upper end of the mass range considered here , we note a sfoewpt prefers large negative values of @xmath16 , potentially making a perfect cancellation between @xmath16 and @xmath161 in eq .",
    "( [ thetabound ] ) difficult . in the case of an imperfect cancellation",
    ", large mass splitting between the two scalar eigenstates is required to compensate and remain within this bound . moreover , both large mass splitting and efficient cancellations drive the parameter space towards small mixing angles .",
    "this phase - transition induced tendency of the parameter space can be viewed as cosmologically driven motivation for direct searches for new low mass ( @xmath162 ) scalar states as well as high precision measurements of higgs signal strengths at the hl - lhc and ilc .",
    "the ilc , tlep , and cepc  with their exceedingly stringent projected sensitivity to the mixing angles  hold considerable promise for observing non - zero mixing associated with the sfoewpt - viable parameter space .",

    "conversely , agreement with the sm value could yield stringent constraints on the possibility of a sfoewpt in this scenario .",
    "uncovering the dynamics of ewsb in the early universe and its possible connection with the origin of the baryon asymmetry remains a key task in particle physics . while the sm scalar sector does not allow for out - of - equilibrium dynamics needed for baryogenesis",

    "this model exemplifies the phase transition dynamics of more extensive sm - extensions incorporating gauge singlet scalars , e.g. ,  variants of the minimal supersymmetric sm that include a singlet superfield .",
    "focusing on the kinematic regime in which no new scalar decay modes arise , we have updated the constraints on the parameters of the xsm in light of the discovery of a higgs - like scalar at the lhc and present determinations of its signal strengths .",

    "should future experiments find evidence for non - zero higgs - singlet mixing , a substantial deviation of the higgs trilinear self - coupling from its sm value , and the existence of a second singlet - like scalar having sm - higgs branching ratios , our analysis would then allow one to narrow down the regions of xsm parameter space consistent with a sfoewpt . a quantitatively robust assessment of the viability of such a transition and a determination of its characteristics would then require a monte carlo study , given the limitations of perturbation theory in this context ( for a discussion of these limitations , see e.g. ,  ref .",
