    "their slitless h@xmath1 spectroscopy surveys use baryonic acoustic oscillations to provide a cosmological standard ruler while the imaging surveys provide weak lensing constraints on dark energy . the full square kilometer array ( ska )",
    "has also been proposed to be used to make comparable constraints on dark energy ( e.g. abdalla et al . 2010 ) , through a hemispheric h i redshift survey . in the process",
    ", every one of these dark energy experiments will also create huge legacy data sets that will benefit many areas of astronomy : e.g. @xmath7 spectroscopic depths of @xmath8 ergs@xmath9s@xmath10 and @xmath11 ergs@xmath9s@xmath10 for _ euclid _ and _ wfirst _ respectively , and @xmath7 point source depths of @xmath12 for _ euclid _ and @xmath13 , @xmath14 for _ wfirst_.    strong gravitational lensing particularly benefits from _ euclid",

    "this is many orders of magnitude of improvement in the numbers of lenses .",
    "many applications of strong gravitational lensing are limited by sample size ( e.g. treu 2010 ) , such as dark matter halo substructure ( e.g. dalal & kochanek 2002 ) , halo density profiles ( e.g. gavazzi et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , cosmological parameters ( e.g. short et al .",
    "2012 , gavazzi et al .",
    "2008 , but see schneider 2014 ) , and extreme high magnification systems ( e.g. wang & turner 1996 ) .",
    "however , identifying these systems with high reliability and completeness is not without its difficulties . in a heroic effort ,",
    "jackson ( 2008 ) visually examined 285423 galaxies with @xmath16 in the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) .",
    "he found two certain new lenses , one probable candidate and a further @xmath17 candidates , to add to the then - known @xmath18 cosmos lenses and @xmath19 candidates .",
    "false positives could be due , for example , to chance lensing - like locations of h ii regions in a galaxy , or tidal tails resembling lensed arcs",
    ". visual inspection of larger data sets is a much more challenging proposition .",
    "this problem has stimulated both the development of arc - finder algorithms in multi - wavelength imaging data ( e.g. gavazzi et al .",
    "2014 ) and the creation the _ spacewarps _ mass participation citizen science experiment .    in this paper",
    "i present alternative methods of identifying strong gravitational lens events , by exploiting the strong magnification bias in the high - luminosity end of the h@xmath1 luminosity function and the high - mass end of the hi mass function .",
    "this paper follows the unfashionably conventional format of introduction , method , results , discussion and conclusions in sections [ sec : introduction ] , [ sec : method ] , [ sec : results ] , [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] respectively .",
    "this paper assumes a hubble constant of @xmath20kms@xmath10mpc@xmath21kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 and density parameters of @xmath22 and @xmath23 throughout .",
    "in the presence of very steep number counts or luminosity functions , a strong magnification bias can operate .",
    "the low probability of galaxy - galaxy lensing producing an apparently - bright lensed galaxy can be more than compensated for by the presence of a very large population of faint candidate background lensed sources .",
    "if the slope of the differential numbers steepens at progressively brighter fluxes or luminosities , then the fraction of lensed sources also progressively increases .",
    "this method of selecting strong gravitational lenses has a successful track record .",
    "negrello et al . (",
    "2010 ) used this technique to select a sample of strong lenses using simply a @xmath24 m flux limit of @xmath25mjy , exploiting the steep slope of submm number counts .",
    "half of the selection were contaminant ( non - lensed ) local galaxies and blazars , but these were easily identifiable in supplementary optical and radio survey data , leaving a sample with an ostensible @xmath4 reliability that the authors confirmed with a wide range of spectroscopic and imaging follow - ups ( see also e.g. viera et al .",
    "2013 , bussmann et al . 2013 ) .",
    "gonzlez - nuevo et al .",
    "( 2012 ) extended this methodology to the high - luminosity end of the submm luminosity function ( estimated using submm photometric redshifts ) , and in the process expanded the number of gravitational lens candidates in _ herschel _ surveys from @xmath26 with a bright flux limit to @xmath27 with a bright luminosity limit in the herschel _ atlas _ project ( eales et al .",
    "2010 ) . after removing known contaminants the reliability of this strong gravitational lens sample was estimated to be @xmath28 , sufficient to warrant extensive follow - up campaigns ( e.g. amber et al . in prep . ) that could yield constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. short et al .",
    "2012 ) , constraints on the evolution of dark matter halo properties , and/or constraints on the background lensed galaxy population ( e.g. eales 2014 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 and far - infrared luminosities of star - forming galaxies have in common that they are dominated by the luminous output of massive stars , which excites nebular emission in hii regions in the case of h@xmath1 , and which is absorbed by dust and re - emitted as grey - body radiation in the case of the far - infrared ( e.g. condon 1992 et seq . ) . both h@xmath1 and far - infrared luminosities",
    "are widely used as star formation rate estimators , among other indicators .",
    "however , the h@xmath1 and far - infrared luminosities have different dependencies on star formation rate : at high star formation rates , a greater proportion of star formation is present in giant molecular cloud complexes , so the h@xmath1 luminosity will tend to plateau as star formation rate increases while the far - infrared continues to increase ( e.g. flores et al .",
    "2004 , swinbank et al .",
    "2004 , calzetti et al .",
    "balmer lines are inevitably dominated by low - extinction regions ( e.g. serjeant et al . 2002 ) , so even balmer decrement - corrected h@xmath1 luminosities will under - predict the total star formation rate in the most extreme starbursts . unless the extinction is accounted for empirically ( e.g. calzetti et al . 2010 ) , naive interpretations of h@xmath1 luminosities consistently under - predict star formation rates for the most luminous starbursts at all redshifts ( e.g. sedgwick et al .",
    "for example , the h@xmath1 luminosities of hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath29 ) are not @xmath30 brighter than those of luminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore , extreme h@xmath1-emitters should be rarer than extreme far - infrared emitters .    for this reason ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect the h@xmath1 luminosity function to have a bright - end slope that is steeper than its far - infrared counterpart ( e.g. lapi et al .",
    "2011 , marchetti et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the latter has already been demonstrated to facilitate strong gravitational lens selection ( e.g. gonzlez - nuevo et al .",
    "2012 ) , so one would expect the bright end of the h@xmath1 luminosity function to be similarly useful .",
    "this paper adopts the h@xmath1 luminosity function determination of geach et al .",
    "( 2010 ) at redshifts @xmath32 , which is characterised by a schechter function .",
    "note that this determination includes both star - forming galaxies and active galaxies .",
    "another population statistic where theoretical models and ( to some extent ) observations lead to steep number counts and an expectation of strong magnification bias is the neutral hydrogen galaxy mass function .",
    "the physical processes determining the neutral hydrogen distribution are arguably simpler than the physics of star formation and dust obscuration .",
    "the local hi mass function is well - described by a schechter function ( zwaan et al .",

    "( 2010 ) and a conservative no - evolution model .",
    "the formalism for calculating the differential magnification probability distribution @xmath33 for a magnification @xmath34 is summarised in blain ( 1996 ) , perrotta et al . ( 2002 ) and perrotta et al .",
    "regardless of the lens population , the high magnification tail has the form @xmath35 for some function @xmath36 . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "`` strong '' lensing is taken to mean magnifications @xmath37 , in which this expression applies .",
    "the form of @xmath36 depends on the nature and evolving number density of lenses .",

    "there is good evidence for the galaxy lens population being well - described by singular isothermal ellipsoids ( e.g. gavazzi et al .",

    ", one can assume the mass spectrum of lensing galaxies does not evolve with redshift ( following e.g. the approach of model `` b '' of blain 1996 , though with a different cosmology ) , and normalise @xmath36 to the prediction of perrotta et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) at an arbitrary redshift of @xmath38 .",
    "these options should span the parameter space of plausible lens populations",
    ".    a more significant source of uncertainty in the lensing predictions is the maximum magnification imposed by the finite source sizes .",

    "( 2002 ) by spanning the range of plausible maximum magnifications with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as appropriate for source characteristic radii of @xmath41kpc ( e.g. wuyts et al . 2013 ) .",
    "high magnification events are known in far - infrared and submm - selected lenses ( e.g. swinbank et al .",
    "2010 ) , but this paper conservatively neglects this extreme population .",
    "the surface density of strong gravitational lenses increases with the maximum magnification ; the choice in this paper is more conservative than that of e.g. blain ( 1996 ) who used @xmath42 , and lima et al .",

    "model predictions of the evolution of the hi mass function tend to dismantle local high - mass systems into a larger number of lower - mass systems at high redshift .",

    "are the h@xmath1 emission lines in the lensing systems detectable by _ euclid _ against the glare of the foreground lens ?",
    "a simple calculation shows that this is typically not likely to be a problem .",

    "with the reasonable assumption of an unresolved line at the expected resolving power of @xmath67 , the observed line flux _ density _ would be around four times the continuum level from the lens .",
    "this is conservatively assuming the lensing galaxy is not extended , which would dilute the flux density contribution from the lens .",
    "this is also assuming that the h@xmath1 emission is also unresolved . the 3d - hst project has found effective h@xmath1 radii at @xmath68 of @xmath69kpc ( wuyts et al .",
    "2013 ) , equivalent to @xmath70 arcseconds , small compared to the nisp spectrometer pixel scale of @xmath71 arcseconds . with angular magnification from lensing",
    ", we may expect the h@xmath1 emission to be typically no more than marginally resolved by _ euclid _",
    ", apart from e.g. quad lens configurations .    the high surface density of strong galaxy - galaxy gravitational lens events in the proposed one - year ska weak lensing survey may have a significant effect on the shear statistics .",
    "the strongly lensed population is identifiable at high hi masses , but further work is needed to quantify the effect on the shear statistics of strongly lensed galaxies at lower hi masses .",
    "however , as a resource in themselves , the hi - selected strong lensing systems are potentially revolutionary .",
    "there are no obvious significant unlensed contaminant populations for the h i - selected samples , but dedicated lensing hi surveys with _ ska _",
    "pathfinders / precursors would identify any such populations .",
    "having prior knowledge of the background source redshifts partly solves one of the major practical problems with strong gravitational lens surveys : the multi - wavelength follow - ups .",
    "for example , most cosmos gravitational lens systems still lack a secure measurement of the background redshift ( e.g. faure et al .",
    "2011 ) , including all three lens candidates from jackson ( 2008 ) .",
    "this problem is intrinsic to morphologically - selected samples of lensing systems and will be a major challenge for morphologically - selected strong lenses from _ euclid _ and _",
    "wfirst_.    the h@xmath1 and hi - selected systems will nonetheless need redshift estimation of the foreground lenses .",
    "the lensing optical depth is maximised approximately half - way between the source and observer , so lens redshifts will be typically in the range @xmath72 .",
    "optical and near - infrared ground - based photometric surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope will be well - suited to obtaining photometric redshifts of massive galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "spectroscopic absorption line lens redshifts are likely to require @xmath73 hour exposures on @xmath74m - class optical telescopes ( e.g. bussmann et al .",
    "2013 , amber et al .",
    "_ in prep_. ) . for early - type lenses selected with",
    "euclid _ and _ wfirst _ , additional lens redshift estimation will be possible from the fundamental plane ( e.g. serjeant et al .",
    "1995 , eisenhardt et al .",
    "the design of the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ) means it is inevitably dominated by early - type lenses ( e.g. auger et al .",
    "2009 ) , but it is not at all clear that early - type lenses are necessarily responsible for nearly all the lensing optical depth in the universe . by exploiting magnification bias , the h@xmath1 and hi selection methods are identifying high magnification lines of sight , irrespective of the nature of the foreground lenses .",
    "submm samples are similarly selected on magnification bias , and as well as early - type lenses they include several group lenses , cluster lenses and late - type galaxy lenses ( e.g. negrello et al .",
    "2010 , bussmann et al .",
    "2013 , negrello et al .",
    "the h@xmath1 and hi lensing samples will be ideal to examine the diversity in the origin of the lensing optical depth to the high redshift universe .",
    "having a large sample of lensing systems will make a wide range of new science applications of lensing possible .",
    "rare lens configurations will become available to study , such as extreme high magnification events probing the morphologies of background galaxies at @xmath30 improved angular resolution or more ( conservatively excluded from our modelling in section [ sec : method ] ) , or rare `` jackpot '' or `` double jackpot '' lenses with multiple galaxies at different redshifts aligned along the line of sight ( e.g. gavazzi et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the latter systems can yield very useful constraints on dark matter density profiles , by providing two or more lines of sight past the closest galaxy .",
    "they were also originally envisaged as a probe of cosmological parameters , but a generalisation of the mass - sheet degeneracy has been discovered ( schneider 2014 ) that will limit this application , unless additional modelling assumptions are invoked .",
    "further statistical constraints on halo density profiles will come from the number counts and redshift distributions of lenses and sources ( e.g. short et al .",
    "2012 ) , and from the interface of strong and weak gravitational lensing ( e.g. gavazzi et al .",
    "image flux ratio anomalies have also been recognised as being caused by halo substructure ( e.g. dalal & kochanek 2002 , vegetti et al .",
    "2012 ) , so large samples of lens system will directly constrain semi - analytic models , particularly using the _ ska _ lensing samples that are immune to the effect of dust obscuration in the foreground lenses .",
    "large lens samples will also make it possible to investigate the stellar initial mass function as a function of galaxy types ( e.g. spiniello et al .",
    "2011 , dutton et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the background sources will at best only be marginally resolved by their discovery observations with _",
    "euclid _ , _ wfirst _ or _ ska _ , but they will be among the brightest line emitters on the sky , so will be easily amenable to follow - up observations",
    ". the high angular resolution of @xmath75m - class telescopes will be very well suited to high surface brightness arcs .",
    "the h@xmath1-emitters will be unchallenging targets in h@xmath1 for the thirty metre telescope ( tmt ) or the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , and a 1-hour exposure with e.g. the metis instrument on e - elt will be sufficient to detect and resolve pa@xmath1 in the h@xmath1-selected sample . scaling from local ultraluminous star - forming galaxies ( veilleux , kim & sanders 1999 , farrah et al .",
    "2013 ) , many h@xmath1-selected lensed galaxies will be easily detectable in far - infrared lines with the proposed spica space observatory ( e.g. roelfsema et al .",
    "diagnostic line ratios may be subject to differential magnification effects ( e.g. serjeant 2012 ) , but this may be corrected for in single systems or statistically in the population through source and lens modelling .",
    "alternatively , differential magnification may be indirectly addressed through a comparison of emission line profiles with those of spatially resolved lines ( e.g. omont et al .",
    "_ euclid _ will be able to generate a sample of @xmath76 strong gravitational lens events with known background redshifts and @xmath26%  reliability by selecting @xmath45 h@xmath1 emitting galaxies at redshifts @xmath77 ; the _ ska _ will similarly be able to compile up to @xmath0 lensing events with @xmath26%  reliability and known source redshifts by selecting @xmath50 systems in an hi survey at @xmath78 .",
