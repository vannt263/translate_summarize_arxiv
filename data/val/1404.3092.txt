    "while the standard big bang cosmological model has accounted for observations of homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on large scales there are still open questions regarding the identification of the dark energy components making up the cosmic fluid @xcite .",
    "this has led to the pursuit of more general models in which the geometry and the matter content have drastically changed when compared to the standard frw cosmologies . to date",
    "the @xmath0cdm concordance model has proved to be highly successful in accounting for all current observations ranging from supernovae ia , cmbr anisotropies , weak lensing , baryon oscillations through to large - scale structure formation@xcite .",
    "there are various alternative cosmological models ranging from inhomogeneous cosmologies with dissipative fluxes @xcite , singularity - free models @xcite , emergent universe models @xcite and the spatially homogeneous bianchi models @xcite .",
    "it is claimed that these models can account for many of the mechanisms leading to the current state of the universe such as inflation , particle production and anisotropy in the infant universe .",
    "the homogeneous and isotropic frw cosmological models are particular cases of the bianchi i , v and ix universes , depending on the constant curvature of the physical three - space , @xmath1 constant . in particular",
    ", the bianchi v universe is a simple generalisation of the negative curvature frw models @xcite .",
    "these alternative models can represent particular epochs during the evolution of our universe . as pointed out by ellis@xcite the anisotropic bianchi - type cosmologies are worthy of attention even if current observations indicate that our universe is flwr - like in nature .",
    "the observed isotropy of the present universe does not rule out the possibility of dominant anisotropic effects in the early universe .",
    "the role of dissipation in inhomogeneous cosmological models have been widely studied .",
    "romano and pavon studied the evolution of the bianchi type - i model with viscous dissipation within the framework of extended irreversible thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "they were able to show that the bianchi type - i cosmological model does not asymptotically evolve into the friedmann or de - sitter phase .",
    "this is mainly due to relaxational effects within the cosmological fluid .",
    "romano and pavon utilised both the truncated and full causal thermodynamic theory to study the evolution of the bianchi type - iii cosmological models .",
    "their results show that there is rapid dissipation of the initial anisotropies leading to stable de sitter solutions while the friedmann ones are unstable @xcite .",
    "causal heat transport in an inhomogeneous cosmological model was investigated by triginer and pavon @xcite . by imposing a barotropic equation of state and by employing a heat transport equation of maxwell - cattaneo form",

    "in this paper we revisit the model investigated by singh and beesham with the view of highlighting the relaxational effects on the temperature distribution . to this end",
    "we employ a causal heat transport equation of maxwell - cattaneo form . by assuming that the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the inverse of the absolute value of the expansion of the cosmic fluid we are able to integrate the truncated heat transport equation to obtain the temperature profile .",

    "et al_@xcite in which they showed that the heat flux serves to ` balance ' the decrease in energy density while the pressure of the cosmic fluid steadily decreases .",

    "et al _ @xcite have shown that a certain parameter @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the transport coefficients of bulk viscosity , heat conduction and shear viscosity , respectively and @xmath55 are the corresponding relaxation times , is a measure of the strength of expansion during the inflationary phase .",
    "larger values of @xmath50 lead to stronger expansion .",
    "furthermore , more efficient models of inflation can be constructed by including bulk viscosity , heat conduction and shear viscosity thus strengthening the case for inhomogeneous cosmological models .",
    "in order to study the influence of relaxational effects when the cosmic fluid departs from hydrostatic equilibrium we employ a causal heat transport equation of maxwell - cattaneo form given by@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 projects into the comoving rest space , @xmath58 is the local equilibrium temperature , @xmath53 ( @xmath59 ) is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is the relaxational time - scale which gives rise to the causal and stable behaviour of the theory .",
    "the noncausal fourier heat transport equation is obtained by setting @xmath62 in ( [ causalgen ] ) . for the metric ( [ a1 ] ) , equation ( [ causalgen ] ) becomes @xmath63where @xmath64 represents the temperature gradient . note that on setting @xmath62 , we regain the eckart heat transport equation @xmath65 which was utilised by singh and beesham to obtain noncausal temperature profiles .",
    "following triginer and pavon@xcite , we assume the thermal conductivity is that for a radiation fluid interacting with matter @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant and @xmath68 is the mean collision time . the mean collision time is related to the particle number density @xmath69 via @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the particle conservation equation @xmath72 which yields @xmath73 .",
    "we can finally write @xmath74 where @xmath71 is another constant . since @xmath75 is the only natural time scale of the cosmological fluid , we define the relaxation time as follows @xmath76 where @xmath77 can be viewed as a causality switch. by setting @xmath78 we regain the noncausal eckart transport equation . the mean collision time is related to the relaxation time via ( [ col1 ] ) , ( [ col2 ] ) and ( [ col3 ] )",
    ". we can write @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant .",
    "utilising ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) in ( [ col3 ] ) we obtain @xmath81 which corresponds to constant relaxation time . from ( [ col4 ] ) , we can immediately write @xmath82 . we can conclude that the assumption made in ( [ col3 ] ) holds to good approximation in the early evolution of the cosmological fluid when temperatures are sufficiently high @xcite .",
    "the causal heat transport equation ( [ causal ] ) becomes @xmath83 which easily integrates to    @xmath84x   + { \\cal { f}}(t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath85\\ ] ] the above equation is readily solved to give us the noncausal temperature profiles for the two cases that we have investigated thus far .",
    "for @xmath30 which corresponds to the case of constant deceleration parameter @xmath86 yields @xmath87x+{\\cal { f}}_2(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is a function of integration . note that ( [ temptemp ] ) does not guarantee @xmath89 .",
    "requiring @xmath89 on physical grounds will constrain the free parameters appearing in ( [ temptemp ] ) .",
    "the noncausal temperature is obtained by setting @xmath78 in ( [ temptemp ] ) .",
    "this would imply ( from ( [ col3 ] ) ) that thermal equilibrium is achieved instantaneously which is one of the pathologies of the eckart theory .",
    "it has been pointed out that entropy of the universe behaves like a an ordinary system and tends to a maximum value of the order of @xmath90 as @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the rate of entropy production is given by @xmath92}{3c^3l } - 8lt]}{c^8\\sqrt{-24\\frac{c^4k_1x\\exp[-4lt](1 + ( -2 + k_1\\exp[-3lt]/c^3)\\beta)}{c_0 } } + { \\cal f}_2(t)},\\ ] ] which vanishes as @xmath93 for an appropriate choice of @xmath94 .",
    "let us consider the temperature profile for the case @xmath42 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the evolution of the causal and noncausal temperature profiles respectively . in order to generate these plots we chose the following parameters : @xmath95 .",
    "figure 1 corresponds to the case @xmath96 giving the noncausal temperature .",
    "figure 2 corresponds to the case @xmath97 representing the causal temperature profile .",
    "it is evident that the causal temperature is everywhere greater than its noncausal counterpart . in the infinite past",
    "both the causal and noncausal temperatures are at a maximum and decrease as the fluid evolves with time .",
    "the drop - off in the temperature is greater in the causal case than the noncausal case indicating that cooling is enhanced by relaxational effects .",
    "we have successfully obtained the causal temperature profile for an lrs bianchi type - v cosmological fluid with constant deceleration parameter .",
    "our results generalise the thermodynamical results obtained by singh and beesham @xcite .",
    "our investigation show that relaxational effects within the cosmic fluid leads to a higher temperature .",
    "we also found that the rate of entropy production decreases as the universe evolves in time , tending to zero for late times .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the evolution of the temperature profile for the lrs bianchi type - v universe with dissipation by employing a full causal heat transport equation .",
