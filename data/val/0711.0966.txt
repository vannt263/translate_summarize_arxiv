    "secondary bars in s2b galaxies have been hypothesized to be a mechanism for driving gas past the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) of primary bars , to feed the supermassive black holes that power active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of secondary bars are still not well understood .",
    "the random apparent relative orientations of primary and secondary bars in nearly face - on galaxies points to dynamical decoupling @xcite . but images alone can not reveal much about how the two bars rotate through each other .",
    "kinematic evidence of decoupling , using either gas or stars , is harder to obtain @xcite .",
    "indirect evidence for decoupling was claimed by @xcite based on rotation velocity peaks inside the secondary bars .",
    "conclusive direct kinematic evidence for a decoupled secondary bar was obtained for ngc 2950 by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cda03 ) who showed , using the method of @xcite , that the primary and secondary bars can not be rotating at the same pattern speed .",
    "simulations offer the best way to understand double barred systems .",
    "however , the decoupled nuclear bars that formed in early simulations did not last long .",
    "for example , the most long - lived nuclear bar in @xcite lasted for less than two turns of the primary bar , corresponding to about 0.4 gyr , which is far too short to explain the observed abundance of nested bars .",
    "furthermore , their models usually require substantial amounts of gas to form and maintain these nuclear bars .",
    "@xcite reported that nested bars form in a quasi - cosmological setting , but the amplitudes of the bars also seem to weaken rapidly after most of gas has formed stars ( * ? ? ? * figure  2 ) .",
    "@xcite found that 4 out of 10 double - barred galaxies contain very little molecular gas in the nuclear region .",
    "these clues suggest that large amounts of molecular gas may not be necessary to maintain central nuclear bars .",
    "@xcite reported that a secondary bar forms in a collisionless @xmath0-body simulation , although their secondary bar had a `` vaguely spiral shape . ''    on the side of orbital studies , @xcite discovered a family of loop orbits that may form building blocks of long - lived nuclear stellar bars ( also @xcite ) .",
    "their studies are very important for the understanding of double barred galaxies , but their models are not fully self - consistent , since nested bars in general can not rotate rigidly through each other @xcite .",
    "so fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations are still needed to check if their main results still hold when the non - rigid nature of the bars is taken into account .",
    "recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ds07 ) demonstrated that long - lived secondary bars can form in purely collisionless @xmath0-body simulations , when a rotating pseudobulge is introduced in their model .",

    "they showed that the behavior of their models were in good agreement with the loop orbit predictions of @xcite .    in this report",
    "we analyze the photometrical and kinematical properties of high resolution models in detail . our theoretical results here",
    "can also be compared to the observed 2-d kinematics of some double - barred galaxies , to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of the secondary bars .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper are all collisionless .",
    "the model setup is very similar to that of ds07 . as in ds07",
    ", the formation of the secondary bar is induced by a rotating pseudobulge .",
    "we focus on three simulations : run d which formed a long - lasting double - barred system due to an initially rotating bulge , run s in which only a single bar formed with an initially unrotating bulge component , and run nb where there is no bulge component initially .",
    "our high - resolution simulations consist of live disk and bulge components in a rigid halo potential .",
    "we restrict ourselves to rigid halos to allow higher mass resolution in the nuclear regions , to study the complicated co - evolution of the two bars without the additional evolution introduced by the halo .",
    "the rigid halos used in this study are all logarithmic potentials @xmath1 .",
    "we set @xmath2 and @xmath3 in all runs .",
    "we employed about four times more particles than the runs published in ds07 to better analyze the photometric and kinematic properties ; run d and s have @xmath4 equal mass particles , with @xmath5 in the disk and the rest in the bulge .",
    "run nb has @xmath5 in the disk only since there is no bulge .",
    "the initial disks in our simulations all have exponential surface densities with scale - length @xmath6 , mass @xmath7 and toomre-@xmath8 .",
    "the bulge was generated using the method of @xcite as described in @xcite , where a distribution function is integrated iteratively in the global potential , until convergence . in both",
    "run d and run s the bulge has mass @xmath9 and we used an isotropic king model distribution function .",
    "the bulge truncation radius is @xmath10 in both run d and run s. the bulge set up this way is non - rotating .",
    "we introduce bulge rotation in run d by simply reversing the velocities of bulge particles with negative angular momenta , which is still a valid solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite . the bulges in run d and",
    "run s are flattened by the disk potential initially , and remain so at later times .",
    "the initial kinematic ratio @xmath11 in run d is slightly above the line for oblate isotropic rotators @xcite .",

    "we use a force resolution ( softening ) of @xmath16 , which scaled to the above physical units corresponds to 25 pc .",
    "these simulations were evolved with a 3-d cylindrical polar grid code @xcite .",
    "this code expands the potential in a fourier series in the cylindrical polar angle @xmath17 ; we truncated the expansion at @xmath18 .",
    "forces in the radial direction are solved for by direct convolution with the greens function while the vertical forces are obtained by fast fourier transform .",
    "we used grids measuring @xmath19 .",

    "we see that for run d the secondary bar shows up in both the disk and bulge components .",
    "all three large scale bars appear qualitatively similar to each other in both the face - on and edge - on views .",
    "when viewed side - on , the large scale bar appears to be boxy / peanut - shaped regardless of whether or not an initial live bulge is included , or if a secondary bar is present .",

    "this is hardly surprising as the small size of the secondary bar makes its side - on signatures , if any , easily masked by the primary .",
    "a caveat may be that the boxiness in figure  [ fig:3dshape ] does not cover a range as wide as that in @xcite .",

    "method 1 , 2 and 4 yield consistent values of the bar lengths and length ratios .",
    "we found that method 3 tends to give a lower value of bar lengths than the other three methods , as shown in @xcite .",
    "although these methods have some uncertainties in measuring the bar lengths , the length ratio of the two bars is in the range of 0.12 to 0.19 ( in particular method 1 , 2 , and 4 give a consistent narrow range of 0.17 to 0.19 ) .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the typical observed length ratio of local s2b systems ( median ratio @xmath38 0.12 , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that we expect that the length of the secondary can not be too large , otherwise the gravitational torque from the primary bar will inevitably twist the secondary into alignment if they rotate at different pattern speeds .",
    "figure  [ fig : sd ] shows the face - on surface density profiles along the major and minor axis of the primary bar in run d , s , and nb . compared with the initial profile of each run",
    ", there is a significant increase in central density following the formation of the large scale bar which redistributes the disk particles . for run",
    "d , the central density profile along the primary bar major axis is no longer higher than that along the minor axis , due to the secondary bar orienting to a different direction from the primary bar .",

    "this can be an important signature of confirming small secondary bars photometrically , especially when the central region is not well resolved .",

    "figure  [ fig : spct ] shows the behavior of the azimuthally averaged @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the location of the lindblad resonances of the bars at around @xmath25 for run d. as shown in ds07 , the pattern speeds of the bars , especially that of the secondary , vary as they rotate through each other : the secondary bar rotates slower than average when the two bars are perpendicular , and faster when the bars are parallel .",
    "the patten speed bands shown in figure  [ fig : spct ] reflect such variations .",
    "clearly the pattern speed of the secondary bar oscillates much more than that of the primary .",
    "the primary bar extends roughly to its cr radius ( @xmath41 ) , consistent with the general expectation and is therefore considered a fast bar ( e.g. cda03 , * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary bar rotates faster than the primary bar .",

    "in addition , even if the variation of the pattern speed is taken into account , the @xmath42 of the secondary is not very close to the @xmath43 of the primary , if we use the same naive definition of @xmath43 as in @xcite read naively from figure  [ fig : spct ] serves just as a visual guide , because the @xmath43 determined this way is reliable only for weak bars , which is questionable for our strong bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ] .",
    "this is inconsistent with the speculated cr - ilr coupling requirement for making secondary bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the long - lasting secondary bars which form in our simulations generally do not extend to their corotation radii , the kinematics of secondary bars differ from those of primary bars in at least this important detail .",

    "we analyzed the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) by measuring the mean velocity @xmath44 and velocity dispersion @xmath45 .",

    "[ fig : n2950mod ] , we project the system to @xmath56 with the lon of @xmath57 relative to the secondary bar major axis .",
    "the most striking feature in figure  [ fig : kinemap ] is that the twist of the kinematic minor axis ( i.e. @xmath58 ) in the secondary bar region is weak ( see the mean velocity maps ) .",
    "the kinematic minor axis is almost perpendicular to the inclination axis , although there is a small but noticeable twisted pinch near the kinematic minor axis in the nuclear region .",
    "the weak central twist is mainly due to the relatively large velocity dispersion , especially in the central region ( likewise at @xmath59 when only the small nuclear bar exists , the stellar twist is slightly stronger than at @xmath22 , but still quite small compared to the expected twist in gaseous kinematics ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the twist of the kinematic _ major _ axis is more prominent in the central region .",
    "@xcite found the stellar kinematic minor axis hardly twists from the pa of the disk in their sample with the most reliable kinematics , leading them to question whether nuclear photometric isophotal twists represent _ bona fide _ dynamically decoupled secondary bars .",
    "we demonstrate that an authentic decoupled secondary bar may indeed produce a very weak twist of the kinematic minor axis in the stellar velocity field .",
    "so a central stellar velocity map without a strong twist as in @xcite does not necessarily exclude the existence of a decoupled nuclear bar .    as a comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : kinemap](f ) shows that the kinematical minor axis twist is just slightly stronger for the single - barred run nb .",
    "of course gas kinematics may show much more twisted features than the stellar data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the gas in the nuclear region is more prone to non - gravitational forces like shocks , agn jets and outflows , so may not directly probe the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "it is also worth noting that the @xmath45 symmetry axis does not align with the secondary or the primary bar ( also true for the single bar run nb ) , which is consistent with what @xcite found . we do not find a clear signature in the @xmath46 map associated with secondary and primary bar .",
    "the ring in the @xmath47 map of figure  [ fig : kinemap](c ) is not always present for different projections , so it can not be used to detect secondary bars .",
    "figure  [ fig : slits ] shows various slit profiles along the major / minor axis of the primary / secondary bar of run d at @xmath22 , and for run s. we notice that there is no central velocity dispersion ( @xmath45 ) drop in our simulated double - barred systems .",
    "so the @xmath45-drop ( as found in @xcite ) is not a requirement , and is not always associated with the formation of a double - barred system .",
    "more likely @xmath45-drops are just the signature of newly - formed ( therefore dynamically `` cool '' ) stars @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations have shown that a @xmath45-drop can be produced in single barred galaxies @xcite , so it is not necessarily a unique feature of double - barred systems .    in figure",
    "[ fig : slits](a ) there is a second reversal of @xmath46 on the major axis of the primary bar in the nuclear region ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "such a @xmath46 feature is never found for a single bar case ( run s ) at any orientation .",
    "it manifests the complex asymmetric los velocity distribution in the nuclear region , and is an indication of the decoupled secondary bar .",
    "however , the reverse argument is invalid : we found that such @xmath46 features are not visible at all orientations .",
    "although our secondary bar is clearly decoupled from the primary bar , the maximum of the rotational velocity does not occur in the nuclear region ( figure  [ fig : slits ] ) , instead the rotational velocity just rises smoothly past the region of the secondary bar ( the half - length of the secondary bar is around 0.4 , see  [ sec : barlength ] ) .",
    "this is different from @xcite , possibly indicating the location of the maximum of the rotational velocity is not a crucial factor for maintaining a nuclear bar .",
    "the dynamical state and evolution of barred galaxies is determined by the pattern speed of their bars .",
    "knowledge of the pattern speeds of secondary bars may constrain mechanisms of their formation and evolution .",
    "not much is yet known with certainty about secondary bar pattern speeds .",
    "observationally , the only direct kinematic constraint on , based on the tremaine - weinberg @xcite method , was obtained for ngc 2950 by cda03 , who showed that the primary and nuclear bars can not be rotating at the same rate .",
    "they further suggested that the nuclear bar of ngc 2950 is either rotating faster or counter - rotating with respect to the primary bar .",
    "* hereafter m06 ) , more emphatically , argued that ngc 2950 _ has _ to be counter - rotating with respect to the primary .",
    "this would raise the prospect that either ngc 2950 is atypical or that counter - rotating ( or possibly librating ) double bars are common .",
    "however , this conclusion is based on the assumption that the tremaine - weinberg ( tw ) method continues to hold for nested bars , which cda03 suggested may not be the case .",
    "our simulations provide an ideal testbed for assessing the reliability of measurements of . here",
    "we test whether the simple version of the tw method as used by cda03 using 3 slits can recover accurately and check whether the signature of apparent counter - rotation can occur without actual counter - rotation .",
    "the tw method requires that the continuity equation is satisfied for some kinematic tracer and that the tracer s density can be written as @xmath61 . for slits parallel to the major axis of the disk , if is the luminosity - weighted mean velocity along any such slit , and the luminosity - weighted mean position along the same slit , then plotting versus results in a straight line with a slope of @xmath62 .",
    "this tw method has been used to measure pattern speeds in large - scale bars @xcite .",
    "cda03 showed that slits passing through the secondary bar did not lie on the same line as those passing through only the primary bar , proving that @xmath63 .",
    "cda03 argued that while  can be measured from the region outside the secondary bar , can not be obtained as easily .",
    "their reasons for this were two - fold : ( 1 ) disentangling the contribution to  and  from the primary and secondary bars is non - trivial and ( 2 ) the secondary bar can not be in rigid rotation @xcite , violating the assumption of the tw method that the density can be expressed as @xmath61 .",
    "disentangling the different contributions to integrals may be possible : cda03 presented two models for doing this and m06 presented another .",
    "m06 also estimated the effect of non - rigid rotation to be less than 15% ; this estimate was however based on the simplifying assumption that the system is 2-d .",
    "we therefore explore the effect of non - rigid rotation on measurements of directly with the simulations .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies in our ability to cleanly disentangle the primary and secondary bars : in our simulations we distinguish between disk and bulge particles .",
    "while the disk particles support both the secondary and primary bars , the bulge particles almost exclusively support only the secondary bar . thus if we consider only bulge particles we have a quite clean tracer population for the nuclear bar .",
    "it is very unlikely that any scheme that can be devised for observational data will ever be able to separate the secondary bar from the primary as cleanly as we can in our simulations .",
    "we therefore apply the tw - method to bulge particles only .",
    "we used 11 slits covering the full region @xmath64 , with @xmath65 where the nuclear bar is strongest .",
    "this corresponds to slit - widths @xmath66 or @xmath67 ( in comparison , the observations of cda03 had @xmath68 ) .",

    "moreover , the redistribution of material being radial along the secondary bar , we expect that the largest errors will occur when the radial motions contribute more to the line - of - sight velocity . while some of the error at all times in figure [ fig : fulls2btw ] is clearly due to noise , a significant part is also physical .",
    "most importantly , we find that , for @xmath104 , the larger @xmath105 is , the larger is the error in .",
    "this leads us to conclude that , as argued by cda03 , the perturbations to the tw method due to non - rigid rotation are sufficiently large as to render simple measurements of @xmath106 noisy at best .",
    "we have focused here on using slits to compare with the observations of cda03 and used only bulge particles to isolate the nuclear bar .",
    "@xcite present an analysis using an extension of the tw method which is able to disentangle multiple pattern speeds provided full 2-d velocity fields .",
    "they find , as here , that the pattern speed of the secondary is prone to larger uncertainties .",
    "however , regularization with that method leads to more accurate measurements of .",
    "although we have shown that the tw method as used by cda03 is not very accurate for secondary bars , it is not so grossly unreliable that we can not consider the question of whether the secondary bar in ngc 2950 is counter - rotating . if it were , this would suggest a formation scenario for double - barred galaxies different from the one presented here .",
    "simulations have found that counter - rotating nuclear bars are possible if counter - rotating material is present in the disk @xcite and this remains a viable model if such material is present in a sufficiently large fraction of galaxies .",
    "starting from the assumption that both bars satisfy the continuity equation and are in rigid rotation ( _ i.e. _  @xmath107 for @xmath108 ) , cda03 showed that the tw method for the two bars combined becomes @xmath109 the observed quantities are and @xmath110 whereas the required quantities for determining the s are @xmath111 and @xmath112 . since slits can be selected to pass through the primary but not the secondary bar , it is possible to derive  assuming that the oscillations in the primary are small ( in good agreement with our simulations ) .",
    "ignoring the effect of non - rigid rotation , cda03 considered two assumptions for in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : s2btw ] to solve for in ngc 2950 .",
    "this gave a range of possible values of , including a secondary bar counter - rotating relative to the primary bar .",
    "using the same data , m06 made a different attempt at isolating the secondary bar .",
    "based on his analysis , m06 also argued that the secondary bar in ngc 2950 is counter - rotating . since the analyses of both cda03 and m06 ignored the non - rigid rotation , neither of the estimates for is likely to be very accurate as we showed above .",
    "nevertheless , we do not find in our simulations cases where the behavior of the integrals resembles that in ngc 2950 .",
    "as emphasized by m06 , the main characteristic of the @xmath113 profile in ngc 2950 is that it becomes steeper without changing sign in the nuclear bar region ( see figure 3 of cda03 ) .",
    "this happens despite the fact that the two bars are on opposite sides of the minor axis ( see figure [ fig : n2950mod ] ) , causing to have the opposite sign of and leading to @xmath96 declining more rapidly in the secondary bar region .",
    "but instead of  also being shallower in this region , cda03 found that @xmath113 steepens there .",
    "for tw measurements of the system in figure [ fig : n2950mod ] , a tw measurement using slits passing through both bars ( now with both disk and bulge particles included ) does not show a steeper @xmath113 profile ( see figure [ fig : xyv405wdisk ] ) .",
    "we conclude that ngc 2950 may indeed have a counter - rotating primary and secondary bars .",
    "another possibility might be that the nuclear bar librates about the primary bar , which deserves more investigation in future studies .",
    "we have analyzed the photometrical and kinematical properties of our high resolution models , and contrasted them when with or without a secondary bar .",
    "this study also compared the simulated secondary bars with observations .",
    "in general the shape of secondary bars in our models is reasonable compared to observed ones .",
    "the length ratio of two bars , determined by various methods , is in the range of 0.12 to 0.19 , in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "we also found the overall edge - on shape of boxy bulges is largely unaffected by the existence of a secondary bar . at lower inclinations ,",
    "the central density profile along the primary bar major axis is lower than that along the minor axis , due to the secondary bar orienting to a different direction .",
    "the primary extends roughly to its corotation radius , and therefore fits the definition of a fast bar ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "although the secondary bar rotates more rapidly than the primary , its semi - major axis is much shorter than its corotation radius , even if we take the oscillation of the bar patterns speeds into account .",
    "we did not find evidence of cr - ilr coupling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our models .",
    "we find that the central twist of kinematic axes is quite weak even if a secondary bar is present , due to the relatively large velocity dispersion of stars in the central region .",
    "this is consistent with the 2-d stellar kinematics of secondary bars studied in @xcite .",
    "there are no clear @xmath47 signatures associated with the presence of secondary bars .",
    "a @xmath46 reversal feature may appear in the nuclear region at some favorable orientations .",
    "we do not find a @xmath45 ( velocity dispersion ) drop for our secondary bar model .",
    "it is more likely that @xmath45-drops are just the signature of newly - formed stars , and it is not necessarily a unique feature of double - barred systems .",
    "we showed that the tremaine - weinberg method is not very reliable even when the primary bar contribution is fully excluded .",
    "the way in which the measurement fails is consistent with the proposal of cda03 , namely that the non - rigid rotation leads to internal motions that violate the stationary frame assumption of the method .",
    "nonetheless , we find no example in our simulations where the behavior of the tw integrals mimics that observed in ngc 2950 .",
    "thus this galaxy may indeed have counter - rotating secondary and primary bars .",
    "the general agreement between our simulations and observations of double barred galaxies gives us confidence that the simulations are capturing the same dynamics as in nature .",
    "this is especially remarkable because secondary bars are not merely scaled down versions of primary bars , but have distinctly different kinematic properties . in the absence of self - consistent simulations",
    ", earlier orbit - based models could not directly confront the challenge from observations which found such differences .",
    "this demonstrates the advantage of finally being able to simulate stellar double - barred galaxies , which had been puzzling for so long .",
