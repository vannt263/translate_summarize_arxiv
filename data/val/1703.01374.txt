    ", the exploitation of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission techniques has become of great interest to support the massive demand for high - speed data services in communication networks .",
    "although mimo techniques have been extensively investigated within the wireless ( radio ) scenario , they have been only recently analyzed in the context of power line communications ( plc ) . in practice ,",
    "when an electric power distribution network deploys multiple conductors , plc can exploit mimo transmission by injecting and receiving signals among the multiple wires connecting the nodes @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of in - home low voltage ( lv ) power distribution networks that deploy three conductors : the phase , the neutral and the protective earth wires .",
    "the recent home plug av2 system @xcite and the itu g.hn standard @xcite have adopted mimo transmission together with a bandwidth extension ( from 2 to 86 mhz ) , precoding , parameters adaptation and a number of advanced techniques at the mac layer that enable high data rates in excess of 1 gbps of peak rate .",
    "this impressive performance level stimulates the interest in plc solutions , their evolution and their application from in - home networking to smart grid applications @xcite .    in order to develop algorithms and assess performance",
    ", it is very important to characterize and model the mimo plc channel .",
    "single - input single - output ( siso ) plc channel modeling is a rather more established area of research than mimo plc channel modeling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  2 ) .",
    "essentially , two different approaches can be followed : a deterministic approach , which assumes a specific network topology , and a statistical approach , where some variability is introduced to produce random channel realizations .",
    "the statistical method is more suitable for a comprehensive model since it statistically emulates the variability encountered within a certain scenario .",
    "contrariwise , a deterministic method well represents a specific configuration , but with a poor overall representativeness .",
    "both these approaches can then be specialized into a bottom - up or a top - down methodology .",
    "the bottom - up methodology has a tight connection with the physical propagation effects , enabling a faithful emulation of an individual channel frequency response ( cfr ) by exploiting the transmission line theory .",
    "its application requires a full network topology knowledge in terms of cable characteristics , layout , connection lengths and loads , resulting into a considerable computational effort .",
    "an example of a bottom - up deterministic siso plc channel model can be found in @xcite . a statistical bottom - up channel model",
    "can then be obtained by using a random topology model as shown in @xcite .",
    "contrariwise , the top - down methodology uses an analytic function , whose parameters are chosen to fit an actual channel measurement in an empirical way .",
    "the top - down approach facilitates the statistical extension with respect to ( w.r.t . ) the bottom - up approach .",
    "one of the first and well - known top - down approaches was discussed in @xcite , where the cfr was modeled taking into account the multipath signal propagation and the cable losses .",
    "later , it was shown that , by introducing variability in some parameters of the fitting function , the model in @xcite can be statistically extended @xcite .",
    "although much effort has been spent in providing faithful siso models , summarized in ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) , only few proposals have been made to define a general mimo plc channel model so far .",
    "this is also due to the fact that mimo plc channel measurement and characterization has started only recently .",
    "the most comprehensive in - home measurement campaign has been conducted by the european telecommunication standards institute ( etsi ) specialist task force 410 ( stf-410 ) @xcite in 2012 .",
    "a first work that extends the siso bottom - up model in @xcite to the mimo case by using multi - conductor transmission line theory based on a large measurement database was described in @xcite .",
    "very recent improvements have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "conversely , a first attempt to model the mimo plc channel impulse response via a top - down approach was detailed in @xcite , while another frequency domain model was proposed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  5 ) and",
    "recently improved in @xcite .",
    "these mimo models start from an analytic fitting function similar to that proposed in @xcite and then they render some parameters random similarly to the siso approach in @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to show that a synthetic top - down approach , based on a pure phenomenological philosophy , can be followed to provide a simple model that is statistically representative of a real wideband mimo plc environment . due to the model baseline methodology",
    ", it can be potentially applied to other communication scenarios , since it is not connected to any physical assumption or propagation phenomena .",
    "furthermore , its underlying concept significantly differs from what has been already proposed in the literature . indeed , differently from the typically more complex transmission line bottom - up methods , e.g. @xcite , or the conventional top - down approaches that use a fitting function related to some physical assumptions , e.g. @xcite , the proposed statistical model is purely phenomenological and directly synthesizes the mimo cfr and its statistical properties . for this reason ,",
    "an initial characterization part is fundamental to first assess the mimo channel properties and then show how to reproduce them by using a reduced set of parameters .",
    "this is done by considering all the measurements of a specific database , obtained from the in - home measurement campaign in the band 1.8100 mhz , carried out by the etsi stf-410 @xcite .",
    "the model is named `` synthetic '' since this terminology encompasses two meanings , namely `` artificial '' , i.e. obtained from synthesis without physical assumptions ( phenomenological ) , and `` compact '' , since the model adopts a small number of parameters .",
    "the theoretical formulation resembles the top - down strategy that we presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) for the in - home siso channel , but it is extended to the far more complex mimo scenario . moreover , the proposed model adopts a completely new strategy to take into account both the frequency and the mimo ports ( or modes ) correlation , represented by the mimo statistical covariance matrix .",
    "in particular , the proposed synthetic model implementation strategy is able to reconstruct the overall mimo matrix by using a significantly reduced number of parameters .",
    "conversely , the method based on the mimo extension of @xcite , despite its theoretical simplicity , must have available all the matrix coefficients and adopts a different and more complex strategy for the phase generation .",
    "this is why it is referred to as not - fully synthetic in the rest of the paper .",
    "the model philosophy is first introduced in section  [ sec : modelbasics ] .",
    "the experimental data is analyzed in section  [ sec : exprevid ] , enabling the derivation of the channel properties , such as the statistical behavior and the exhibited statistical correlation among the frequencies and between the mimo modes .",
    "then , the synthetic modeling strategy , which uses a reduced set of parameters to reconstruct the mimo plc channel characteristics , is detailed and justified by the experimental evidence in section  [ sec : modeldescript ] .",
    "this description guarantees the methodology replicability .",
    "the results are validated in section  [ sec : results ] by showing that the proposed statistical model is capable to replicate the measured channels in terms of statistical metrics , i.e. average channel gain ( acg ) , root - mean - square delay spread ( rms - ds ) , and coherence bandwidth ( cb ) @xcite , as well as in terms of mimo modes correlation measured by the condition number @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the channel capacity distribution ( or maximum achievable rate according to shannon s definition ) is also considered as a further benchmarking tool .",
    "all the mentioned quantities have been computed considering the overall measurements database . a comparison with the not - fully synthetic procedure , as well as with the results provided by the synthetic strategy , when considering a reduced set of mimo modes ,",
    "is also performed within this section .",
    "finally , the conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "most of the proposed top - down channel models , e.g. @xcite , are based on an analytic function that represents some physical phenomena , such as the multipath propagation due to the several branches and load mismatches that cause multiple signal reflections in a plc network .",
    "similarly , the model presented in @xcite is based on the theoretical formulation provided in @xcite .",
    "therefore , some physical assumptions are made , resulting into a hybrid top - down and bottom - up model .",
    "contrariwise , the basic idea underlying the proposed model is fully phenomenological and focuses on a pure top - down procedure .",
    "to start , the generic siso cfr at frequency @xmath2 , namely @xmath3 , is a complex number that can be expressed in amplitude @xmath4 and phase @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 . in order to simplify the discussion ,",
    "the cfr in db scale , namely @xmath7 , is considered , yielding @xmath8 where the real part @xmath9 is the amplitude in db scale , while the imaginary part is still the phase in radians multiplied by the constant value @xmath10 .    in practice ,",
    "when considering a plc scenario , the quantity @xmath3 changes depending on the considered network topology and the specific pair of nodes , e.g. , outlets in a home network .",
    "thus , from a statistical perspective , @xmath3 can be modeled as a random variable ( rv ) , while the ensemble of all the available @xmath11 frequency samples can be grouped into a channel vector of @xmath11 rvs .",
    "similarly , a general mimo channel can be represented by a three - dimensional ( 3d ) matrix @xmath12 of rvs with dimensions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the number of receiving and transmitting ports , respectively .",
    "it follows that a mimo plc channel is completely described by an equivalent 3d matrix of rvs characterized by certain statistics and relationships .",
    "therefore , a typical communication scenario can be emulated by generating a set of simulated channels having a statistical behavior and , in particular , a frequency and mimo modes correlation that are equivalent to those derived from experimental data .",
    "hence , to provide an effective channel emulator , real data must be analyzed to propose a replicable modeling approach , possibly with a reduced set of parameters .",
    "this is the subject of the next sections .",
    "[ ssec : thform ] the proposed model considers the marginal distribution of the cfr , i.e. the distribution function of the amplitude and phase , as well as the their statistical correlation between the different mimo modes and among the different frequencies .",
    "however , as it will be clarified in section  [ sec : exprevid ] , the cfr amplitude and phase can be approximated as independent .",
    "thus , their marginal distribution and statistical auto - correlation are sufficient to provide an order two statistics of the channel .    in order to obtain such statistics from real data and to simplify the modeling procedure ,",
    "the 3d matrix @xmath12 is reshaped into a vector @xmath16 of size @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the first @xmath11 elements concern all the frequency samples of the first receiving and transmitting port .",
    "the second @xmath11 elements correspond to the frequencies of the second receiving port and the first transmitting port , and so on for all the @xmath14 receiving ports .",
    "afterwards , all the other @xmath15 transmitting modes are considered accordingly .",
    "hence , the 3d matrix @xmath12 is reshaped as @xmath18^t,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the transpose operator , while @xmath20 is the row vector of rvs associated to the frequency samples vector @xmath21 for the cfr between the @xmath22-th transmitting and the @xmath23-th receiving ports .",
    "the statistical covariance matrix , of size @xmath24 , of the reshaped vector @xmath16 is given by @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the complex conjugate operator and @xmath27 $ ] is the expectation operator w.r.t .",
    "the overall set of realizations .",
    "instead , @xmath28 is the cfr between the @xmath22-th transmitter and the @xmath23-th receiver port at the @xmath29-th frequency sample , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 $ ] is the corresponding average value .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the row and column indexes of @xmath36 that , according to the previously described reshaping method , are function of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively",
    ". in particular , the row index is given by @xmath39 , and the same applies to the column index @xmath35 for the values @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in the following",
    ", the normalized covariance matrix @xmath43 is also considered .",
    "it is computed as the covariance matrix in ( [ eq : covmtx ] ) normalized by the product of the related rvs standard deviation , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "each element of @xmath46 ranges from 0 ( no correlation ) to 1 ( fully correlated ) and thus it is equivalent to the pearson correlation coefficient @xcite .",
    "hence , each coefficient of the matrix @xmath46 represents the correlation degree among the corresponding frequency samples and between the different transmitting and receiving ports ( mimo modes correlation ) .    by exploiting ( [ eq : cfrdb ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : covmtx ] ) , the covariance matrix , of size @xmath24 , of the cfr in db can be obtained as @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the covariance matrix between the amplitude ( in db scale ) and the phase , while @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the auto - covariance matrices of the amplitude in db and the phase , respectively .",
    "obviously , in this case , the amplitude and the phase are vectors reshaped as in ( [ eq : reshmtx ] ) , equivalently to the cfr vector @xmath16 .",
    "as it can be noted , the real part of @xmath51 depends only on the amplitude and phase auto - covariance matrices , while the imaginary part is a function of the mutual covariance matrix , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the covariance matrices @xmath51 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 provide information about the joint distribution function of the cfr amplitude and phase , which gives a second order characterization of the channel in a certain frequency range , as detailed in @xcite . hence , according to the above formulation , only the amplitude and phase properties need to be assessed and reproduced to obtain the desired behavior , providing an extremely compact procedure , named synthetic modeling strategy .",
    "in this section , a database of mimo plc in - home experimental cfrs is considered to obtain the statistics needed by the model , whose basic elements were described in the previous section .",
    "the mimo in - home channel scenario has relevant application value .",
    "the measurements are briefly discussed first , assessing the main statistical properties and the relationships required for the generation process .",
    "this analysis highlights several properties that enable further simplifications to the general model , as detailed in section  [ sec : modeldescript ] .",
    "the database of experimental channels collected during the measurement campaign across europe by the etsi stf-410 @xcite is herein evaluated .",
    "the database consists of 353 mimo cfrs with 1588 samples in the extended 1.8100 mhz frequency range measured via a vector network analyzer .",
    "the in - home lv power distribution networks herein considered deploy three wires , two for the power supply , namely the phase ( p ) and the neutral ( n ) , and one for protection in case of an insulation fault , i.e. the protective earth ( e ) .",
    "plc modems can instantiate mimo communication as follows @xcite . at the transmitter side a differential transmission can be implemented by signaling among a pair of wires . at the receiver side , instead",
    ", the signal can be observed between each wire and a reference plane in a star - style configuration . beyond the three standard star - style receiving modes , an additional mode , named common mode ( cm ) , can be extracted @xcite . due to kirchhoff s law ,",
    "only two out of three transmitting voltages are linearly independent .",
    "the third is a linear combination of the other two .",
    "thus , only two signals can be injected .",
    "the same thing applies at the receiver , i.e. , among the four acquired signals , only three are linearly independent ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 mimo channel that includes the pn and pe transmitting ports and the p , n , and cm star - style receiving ports , is considered in the following .      from the analysis of the measurements in @xcite ,",
    "the following properties have been found .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath3 is log - normally distributed , hence @xmath52 is normally distributed , while the phase is uniformly distributed in @xmath53 , at any frequency and for each individual transmitting - receiving mode combination .",
    "this confirms the findings about siso channels in @xcite and in @xcite . in particular , the mean ( @xmath54 ) and the standard deviation ( @xmath55 ) for the best normal fit of the cfr amplitudes in db are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : musigma ] as a function of frequency and for all the considered transmitter - receiver mode combinations in the 1.8100 mhz band .        .robust regression fit coefficients for the mean and standard deviation parameters of the amplitude in db scale . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      mimo case in the 1.8100 mhz band . ]",
    "the statistical metrics for the experimental and the simulated channels for both the @xmath56 mimo and siso channels are listed in table  [ tab : avgvalsubset ] . a good agreement is observed in terms of @xmath1 and statistical metrics average value , with some differences only in terms of cb .",
    "this is mainly due to the approximation adopted for the amplitude covariance matrix anti - diagonal profile discussed in section  [ ssec : ampgen ] .",
    "in addition , similar values are obtained also for the acg average standard deviation , while the rms - ds and cb experimental and simulated standard deviations are not so close . as discussed in section  [ ssec:2x3mimo ] , this discrepancy is mainly related to the adopted simplifications .",
    "nevertheless , a good performance replicability is obtained , as confirmed by the capacity ccdf .",
    "the experimental and simulated channel capacity ccdf for both the schemes @xmath56 mimo and siso is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capccdfsubset ] .",
    "it can be noted as there is a good agreement between the performance achieved by the measurements and those obtained by the simulated channels generated according to the synthetic modeling strategy . in particular , an almost perfect matching is noticeable for the siso transmission scheme , while some deviations are found for the @xmath56 mimo case when considering high capacity values .",
    "modeling the plc channel is relevant to support the task of testing and developing communication solutions over power lines .",
    "a brief overview has been given concerning the main modeling approaches present in the literature , mostly limited to the siso scenario .",
    "in this paper , an extremely compact and effective top - down modeling method has been proposed for the mimo plc channel , which has been derived from a pure phenomenological approach .",
    "it is based on the synthesis of the second order channel statistics observed in a real data set .",
    "the model is compact and requires few parameters to simulate an in - home @xmath0 mimo plc channel in the band 1.8100 mhz , i.e. the appropriate cfr amplitude and phase statistics and their modes and frequency correlation .",
