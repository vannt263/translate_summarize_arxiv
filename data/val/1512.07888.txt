    "we analyse free elko fields in three string like models in 6d . despite the behavior of these models",
    ", there is no possibility of trapping the zero mode of this spinor field .",
    "the massive modes of free elko can not be bounded as well .",
    "the massive eigenfunctions are complex valued and their squared norm exponentially increase .    in order to the zero mode to be trapped , we propose an exotic topological coupling for elko , featured in ref .",
    "we imposed the exotic term to eliminate the contributions of the spin connection .",
    "hence the equation of motion for the elko is led to the equations for gravity in 6d scenarios @xcite . in this case",
    ", the zero mode thoroughly attends the conditions to be confined in all 6d scenarios presented in this work , whereas any massive mode can be bounded .",
    "the complete analysis of mass spectrum and massive modes are introduced in @xcite for gs , in @xcite for ta , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for hc model as well , where the kaluza - klein resonant modes are studied in @xcite likewise .    for future works ,",
    "we propose the generation of a 6d model by an topological abelian higgs model where the background exotic term can be naturally obtained from this geometry .",
    "the study of another types of coupling are also present in our aims",
    ". moreover , further mass - dimension one fields , like the self - interacting ones for any spin @xcite and singular spinor fields @xcite are going to be analysed in a 6d model context , accordingly .",
