    "it is well established , that the statistics of long flexible polymer macromolecules in a good solvent is governed by scaling laws in the asymptotic limit of infinitely long chains .",
    "the model of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) is regarded as most successful in capturing the universal behaviour of polymer chains @xcite . in particular , for the averaged end - to - end distance and number of configurations of saw with @xmath3 steps one finds : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are universal exponents , that depend on the space dimension @xmath6 only ( for numerical estimates see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath7 is a non - universal fugacity . the scaling laws ( 1 ) correspond to the swelling regime of of polymer coils .",
    "note , that the situation changes , when the temperature of the solution decreases .",
    "for any generic polymer solvent system one finds a so - called @xmath8-temperature @xcite , at which the solvent mediated attractive and repulsive interactions between the monomers cancel .",
    "in this situation the scaling properties of the polymer chain can be described by that of a simple random walk ( rw ) .",
    "then , the scaling laws ( [ sawscaling ] ) hold with exponents @xmath9 . at temperatures below the @xmath8-point ,",
    "the polymer undergoes a collapse transition and passes to a globule regime with a scaling exponent @xmath10 .",
    "as established by de gennes @xcite , the scaling properties of saws can be studied in the language of field theory , by mapping the @xmath11-symmetrical spin model at its critical point to polymer field theory by a formal @xmath12 limit . in this way ,",
    "the powerful renormalization group ( rg ) methods , which are traditionally used to quantitatively describe the critical behaviour of magnetic systems and to determine the critical exponents , can be applied to polymer solutions . in the frames of the rg ,",
    "the scaling behaviour of the model is determined by the stability and physical accessibility of a corresponding fixed point ( fp ) . for a polymer chain , the crossover from the rw regime to that of",
    "the saw corresponds to the interchange of stability between the gaussian ( g ) fixed point ( corresponding to absence of interaction between monomers ) and the polymer ( p ) fixed point .",
    "the scaling of a saw is governed in by exponents ( 1 ) that belong to the @xmath13 universality class .",
    "these are the most prominent scaling exponents in polymer physics , however , there are more . on the one hand , there is a series of exponents governing the scaling of polymers of complex topology  star polymers and networks @xcite . on the other hand , the scaling laws ( 1 ) may change if e.g. disorder in the system gives rise to a separate stable fp .",
    "both cases are considered below .",
    "the present communication aims to attract attention to appearance of new scaling laws related to a constraint on the polymer system in the form of a disordered environment or to a more complex architecture of the polymers .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in investigating the interplay of different aspects of complexity appearing simultaneously such as the degree of branching of the polymer , its possibly inhomogeneous composition and the type of disorder in the environment .",
    "we derive and calculate the scaling exponents for the corresponding universality classes and discuss the relevant observable phenomena .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we first describe different possible scenarios of scaling behaviour and present the field - theoretical description for models of polymers in these scenarios .",
    "we then discuss the results and the underlying physical phenomena .",
    "our discussion encompasses previous results @xcite as well as recent extensions @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of rg transformation , the scaling exponents ( 1 ) originate from anomalous dimensions of local operators evaluated at the stable fp .",
    "the scaling laws can be altered by connecting single polymer chains into more complex structures , which in the language of field theory amounts to the appearance of new composite operators .",
    "the most simple non - trivial representative of the class of branched polymers is the so - called star polymer , which consists of linear chains , linked together at one of their end - points . for a star with @xmath14 arms each with @xmath3 steps ( monomers ) , the number of possible configurations scales as @xcite : @xmath15 the second part shows the power law in terms of the size @xmath16 of a single chain of @xmath3 monomers on microscopic step length @xmath17 .",
    "the exponents @xmath18 , @xmath19 are universal star exponents , depending on the space dimension @xmath6 and number of arms @xmath14 .",
    "this includes the single polymer chain with @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "some results on star polymers can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "linking together polymers of different species , results in non - homogeneous polymer stars , which may have a richer scaling behaviour @xcite .",
    "a particular case is the copolymer star , consisting of polymer chains with two different @xmath8-temperatures .",
    "let @xmath22 chains be in the good solvent condition while further @xmath23 chains of the star polymer are at their @xmath8-temperature .",
    "then the partition function of this star copolymer scales as@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents a family of copolymer star exponents and @xmath26 indicates one of eight possible fps in this ternary polymer scenario @xcite .",
    "what is the influence of structural disorder on the scaling laws eqs.(2),(3 ) ?",
    "such structural disorder may be present in a solution in terms of a porous medium .",
    "it has been shown however , that uncorrelated point - like defects of weak concentration will not induce any change of polymer scaling behaviour @xcite : the polymer fp , as for saw on a pure lattice , remains stable and physically accessible .",
    "more interesting is the case of so - called long - range - correlated disorder , where the distribution of structural defects is characterised by a correlation function that decays with a power law @xmath1 @xcite for large @xmath2 .",
    "the non - trivial influence of long - range ( lr ) disorder on the scaling properties of single polymer chains and star polymers has recently been worked out in the frames of the field - theoretical approach @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the statistics of flexible polymer chains can be extracted in the formal limit @xmath27 of an @xmath28-vector model at its critical point .",
    "similarly , the scaling of a polymer experiencing lr correlated disorder can be studied using the effective hamiltonian : @xmath29\\label{lag } { + } \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}\\delta(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4)\\times } \\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n \\frac{u_0}{4 ! } \\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_1}\\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_2 } \\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_3}\\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_4}\\right .",

    "the impact of disorder on the universal behaviour can be singled out by analysing the occurrence and stability of the disorder induced fixed point .",
    "the appearance of a new universality class within the model ( [ lag ] ) was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite using two complementary rg approaches : a first order expansion in ` small ' parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 following ref.@xcite and a second order calculation using numerically evaluated integrals at fixed @xmath6 and @xmath37 of ref.@xcite .",
    "our latter two loop calculation confirms the existence and stability of a lr disorder induced fp for polymers .",
    "however , the fp as found by the first order @xmath38-expansion appeared to be stable in a non - physical region .    here",
    ", it is our intention to investigate a higher order approximation to confirm the stability of the lr disorder fp in the physical region also within the @xmath39-expansion .",
    "we use the second - order rg @xmath40-functions of the @xmath28-component model in lr correlated disorder , as derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . converting these to continuous differential equations , and passing to the @xmath41 limit",
    "we find : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a rescaling parameter , @xmath44 .",
    "looking for the fps of this rg flow , we find the lr disorder induced fp @xmath45 , @xmath46+@xmath47 .",
    "this fp is stable and physically accessible for @xmath48 or equivalently @xmath49 . taking into account , that according to eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) lr disorder should be relevant for @xmath50 , these second order results establish the presence of the lr fixed point in the physical region of ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "as explained in ref.@xcite , the study of @xmath14-arm star configurations in this theory is given in terms of the anomalous dimensions of complex composite operators , containing products of @xmath14 zero - component fields .",
    "the presence of a new stable fixed point leads to different values of the scaling exponents for polymers . in particular , for star polymers , the first order expressions for the exponents @xmath52 for a star in a pure solvent and for a star influenced by long - range correlated disorder ( lr ) read : @xmath53 note the decrease of @xmath18 at fixed @xmath54 with increasing @xmath55 ( i.e. when the correlation of the disorder becomes stronger ) .",
    "however , the behaviour for chain polymers @xmath56 differs : in this case the exponents @xmath57 increase for increasing @xmath55 .",
    "omitting factors of @xmath58 , let @xmath59 be the free energy of a star polymer in the pure solvent and @xmath60 its free energy in a porous medium .",
    "then we can estimate the free energy difference of a star polymer with respect to the two environments : @xmath61 the difference in the free energy consists of two terms .",
    "the first is independent of the polymer architecture and simply takes into account the change in chemical potential per monomer .",
    "two polymers of the same molecular weight ( same total number of monomers @xmath62 ) will experience the same difference .",
    "the second term which grows with @xmath63 is architecture dependent .",
    "following eqs .",
    "( [ change ] ) , we see that this term has different signs for chain polymers ( @xmath64 ) , and star polymers ( @xmath65 ) . thus , even though both may be expected to be expelled from the correlated environment , this effect is weakened for linear polymers and enhanced for star polymers of the same molecular weight .",
    "the first term could in principle be cancelled out if the pure part of the solution is exchanged by a second porous medium which however displays short range ( sr ) disorder with the same chemical potential @xmath66 .",
    "static architecture induced separation results , see fig.[star ] .",
    "exploring further aspects of complexity , we consider star polymers built from chains of species with different @xmath8-temperatures ( copolymer stars ) . depending on the temperature , one or more of inter- and",
    "intra - chain interactions may vanish , and additional fps appear for the inter - chain interaction .",
    "a species with vanishing intra - chain interaction is represented by rws avoiding the other species .",
    "this situation may also be used to describe the diffusion of particles near an absorbing polymer @xcite .",
    "the moments of the resulting flow near the polymer turn out to be multi - fractal @xcite . the scaling exponents of copolymer stars also determine the scaling of corresponding copolymer networks @xcite and play role in a number of other phenomena , given below .    treating the model of star copolymers in a porous medium by the rg approach",
    ", we have found different scenarios of scaling behaviour and corresponding values for scaling exponents @xcite . to summarise some results for the exponents ,",
    "let us first introduce some notations .",
    "each regime is denoted by two letters , corresponding to species 1 and 2 respectively and reflecting , whether it behaves like random walk ( @xmath16 ) or self - avoiding walk @xmath67 .",
    "the index @xmath68 denotes the presence of long - range - correlated disorder .",
    "the index @xmath69 corresponds to the situation , when species @xmath70 and @xmath21 interact with each other . when disorder is absent , we reproduce known results @xcite for the cases of two interacting random walks",
    "@xmath71 , two interacting saws @xmath72 and saws interacting with random walks @xmath73 : @xmath74 @xmath75 is equivalent to the exponent of a homogeneous star polymer of @xmath76 arms . turning on the long - range - correlated disorder ,",
    "we obtain estimates for the exponent @xmath77 for different regimes in a new universality class : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the exponent for the homogeneous star with @xmath80 arms in long - range - correlated disorder , @xmath81 and @xmath82 describe @xmath23 random walks , interacting with @xmath22 rws and saws respectively , in lr disorder .    besides the usual polymer exponents describing statistical properties like end - to - end distance or number of configurations , polymers of complex structure ( e.g. star copolymers )",
    "are characterised by the full set of star exponents .",
    "these star exponents form a basis to determine the scaling of complex copolymer networks @xcite .",
    "they are important for a wide range of phenomena , some examples are given by the absorption of diffusive particles in the vicinity of an absorbing polymer @xcite , the effective interaction in colloids of star polymers @xcite , the transition of double stranded to single stranded dna @xcite . as we have demonstrated in this paper polymer scaling behaviour is influenced in a non trivial way by correlated structural disorder .",
