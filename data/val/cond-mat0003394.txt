    "a one - dimensional lattice model of hydrophobic attraction has recently been studied  @xcite .",
    "the model incorporates what is believed to be the basic mechanism of the hydrophobic effect ; viz .",
    ", that the accommodation of the solute in the solvent is energetically favorable but sufficiently unfavorable entropically as to result in an increase in free energy .",
    "this increase is smaller when the hydrophobes are close together than when they are widely separated , resulting in a net solvent - mediated attraction between them .",
    "the unfavorable entropy of accommodating the solute is achieved in the model by allowing each solvent molecule to have a large number @xmath2 of possible orientations but requiring two neighboring solvent molecules to be both in a special one of those @xmath2 states if they are to accommodate a hydrophobic solute in the interstitial site between them .",
    "that circumstance in which two neighboring solvent molecules are both in that special orientation is taken to be energetically favorable by an amount previously called  @xcite @xmath3 .",
    "the condition of hydrophobicity at temperature @xmath4 was that @xmath5 , with @xmath6 boltzmann s constant . to model the hydrophobic effect realistically ,",
    "@xmath7 was taken to be @xmath8k and @xmath2 was taken to be 110,000 .",
    "it was then a property of the model that forcing the solvent to accommodate a hydrophobic solute greatly restricted ( to one state out of @xmath2 ) the possible orientations of the solvent molecules neighboring the accommodated solute .",
    "such restriction of solvent orientation by the solute is consistent with experimental measurements of nmr relaxation times , which show that the reorientation times of water molecules that neighbor a solute with alkyl groups are about twice as long as in pure water , and that there is an increased activation energy for the reorientation in the presence of the solute over that in pure water.@xcite    it was a striking feature of the one - dimensional model that the range and strength of the solvent - mediated attraction between solutes were inversely related to each other ; at low temperatures the attraction was weak but long - ranged and at high temperatures it was strong but short - ranged .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work was to see if that inverse relation , which is of potential importance in the interpretation of experiment , persists in higher dimensions , and it is indeed found to be so .    it was also found earlier in the one - dimensional model that the solubility of the hydrophobe decreases with increasing temperature , which is consistent with the increasing hydrophobicity that manifests itself in the increasing strength of the hydrophobic attraction .",
    "this temperature dependence of the solubility , too , is found here to persist in the two- and three - dimensional models .",
    "it is also found , as in the one - dimensional model , that if the energy of interaction of the hydrophobic solute with its solvent neighbors ( earlier called @xmath9 ) is greater than the magnitude @xmath10 of the favorable energy of solvent alignment , then the solubility , after first decreasing with increasing temperature , reaches a minimum and then increases .",
    "the two- and three - dimensional versions of the model are defined in the following section .",
    "also in section [ sec : models ] are the basic formulas that relate the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force and the solubility to the quantities that are measured in the simulations .",
    "the details of the simulations are in section [ sec : simulation ] , where the results are also displayed .",
    "these are discussed and summarized in the concluding section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the two - dimensional model is pictured in fig .",
    "1 . at each site of a square lattice",
    "there is a solvent molecule that may be in any of a large number , @xmath2 , of different states ( orientations ) .",
    "solute molecules may only be accommodated at the interstitial sites between neighboring pairs of solvent molecules , but only if that site is not already occupied and then only if the two solvent molecules in question are both in a special one of the @xmath2 states , called state 1 in what follows .",
    "the figure shows three solute molecules so accommodated .",
    "the three - dimensional model is defined similarly , and also on a lattice of coordination number 4 , as in two dimensions .",
    "this three - dimensional lattice is pictured in fig .",
    "it is obtained by systematically removing two bonds from each vertex of a simple cubic lattice , in such a way that from each site @xmath11 there remains a bond to the neighboring sites at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as well as to those at @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 is even but to those at @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead if @xmath16 is odd .",
    "the lattice is topologically ( not metrically ) equivalent to the tetrahedral diamond lattice , which is also the lattice of oxygen atoms in the metastable phase of ice called ice i@xmath19 .    in",
    "both the two- and three - dimensional versions of the model only neighboring solvent molecules interact with each other , which they do with energy @xmath20 if both are in the special state 1 and with energy @xmath21 otherwise .",
    "the only solvent molecules with which a solute molecule interacts are its immediate neighbors ; the sum of its energies of interaction with them is @xmath9 .    solute molecules may interact with each other but that is irrelevant here ; the solute - solute interaction does not enter the expression for the _ solvent - mediated part _ of the potential of mean force between pairs of solutes in the infinitely dilute solution  @xcite , nor is it relevant for the solubility of the solute , which is so slight that solute - solute interactions are negligible .",
    "the solute - solvent interaction parameter @xmath9 is also absent from the expression for the potential of mean force in the infinitely dilute solution but it is a significant parameter in the solubility.@xcite    because the coordination number of the lattices considered here is 4 , rather than 2 as in one dimension , the values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 required to model the hydrophobic effect conveniently but still realistically over the temperature range 275 - 375k are both much smaller than in one dimension . here , in both the two- and three - dimensional models ,",
    "they are taken to be @xmath22k instead of 3000k and @xmath23 instead of 110,000 .",
    "it is still the case , as in the one - dimensional model , that @xmath5 over the relevant temperature range , and that the extent to which @xmath24 exceeds @xmath3 increases with increasing temperature  which are the respective conditions required for the hydrophobic effect to manifest itself and to do so with increasing strength as the temperature increases .",
    "let @xmath25 be the probability that in the pure solvent both molecules of a given neighboring pair will be found in the special state 1 ; and let @xmath26 be the probability that the molecules at two such pairs of sites will all be found to be in the special state 1 when the corresponding two interstitial sites , one associated with each pair , are separated by the metrical distance @xmath27 ( measured in units of the lattice spacing ) . in the two - dimensional lattice of fig .",
    "1 the values of @xmath27 that occur are @xmath28 ; etc . in the three - dimensional lattice of fig .",
    "2 the values of @xmath27 that occur are those and also @xmath29 , etc .",
    "let @xmath30 be the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force between two solute molecules a distance @xmath27 apart , in the limit of infinite dilution .",
    "this is the potential of mean force from which the direct interaction between the two solute molecules themselves has been subtracted , and is the part of the mean - force potential that is of interest here .",
    "then , as in the one - dimensional model,@xcite @xmath30 is given in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 are what are determined in the simulations and @xmath30 is then obtained from ( 1 ) .",
    "it is a property of the solvent alone , and so depends only on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 but not on @xmath9 .",
    "the solubility is defined as in the earlier one - dimensional model.@xcite one imagines a hypothetical ideal gas of pure solute , of number density @xmath32 , in osmotic equilibrium with the saturated solution ; _ i.e. _ , having a thermodynamic activity equal to that of the solute in the solution .",
    "then if @xmath33 is the number density of the solute in the solution , the solubility @xmath34 is here defined as the dimensionless ratio @xmath35 if the solubility is low so that the saturated solution is very dilute , this @xmath34 is the ostwald absorption coefficient and is given by@xcite @xmath36 thus , @xmath34 is obtained once @xmath25 is calculated and a value of the solute - solvent interaction energy @xmath9 is specified .",
    "properties of the two- and three - dimensional models presented in the previous section are explored by means of monte carlo simulations . in these simulations ,",
    "one solvent molecule is placed on each lattice site . for each molecule , we keep track of whether its state is the special state 1 , or not .",
    "solute molecules are not present in the monte carlo simulations , since the aim of the simulations is to numerically estimate the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , from which the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force can be computed using ( [ eq : w ] )",
    ".    the dynamics of the models are not specified , and we are therefore free to choose any dynamics that yield the correct equilibrium properties . in our monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the dynamics consist of two processes : 1 ) each solvent molecule that is in its special state 1 leaves this special state with a rate of @xmath37 per time unit ; 2 ) each solvent molecule that is in a different state enters its special state with a rate of @xmath38 per time unit , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites that are occupied with a solvent molecule in its special state .",
    "an efficient implementation of these dynamics is obtained with a bkl - scheme , after bortz , kalos and lebowitz  @xcite .",
    "the simulations are performed on a @xmath41 lattice for the two - dimensional model , and a @xmath42 lattice for the three - dimensional model , both with periodic boundary conditions in order to reduce finite - size effects . in the initial configuration ,",
    "no molecule is in its special state .",
    "this configuration is then thermalized for 0.1 time units .",
    "after thermalization , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are measured every @xmath43 time unit , up to a total time of @xmath44 time units , and averaged . in a simulation of this length and for these system sizes ,",
    "the two - dimensional and three - dimensional model undergo roughly @xmath45 and @xmath46 local changes , respectively .",
    "this procedure is repeated 10 times for each of the temperatures @xmath4=275 , 300 , 325 , 350 , and 375k , and for the three - dimensional model also at a temperature of 250k at which the system is probably metastable , the stable regime being one where almost all atoms are in their special state .",
    "the values for the quantity @xmath25 are presented in table [ tab : p11 ] , for the two- and three - dimensional models .",
    "this quantity is decreasing with increasing temperature .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is one of the two factors determining the solubility as defined in equation ( [ eq : solubility ] ) , the other being @xmath47 .",
    "while this latter factor is monotonically increasing with increasing temperature for @xmath48 , our data show that @xmath25 is monotonically decreasing with increasing temperature .",
    "for some choices of @xmath9 , the combination of these two factors leads to a solubility that is initially decreasing with increasing temperature ( a signature of the hydrophobic effect ) , but later increasing .",
    "the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force @xmath30 is plotted as a function of the distance @xmath27 in fig . 3 for the two - dimensional model , and in fig . 4 for the three - dimensional model",
    ". in the latter figure ,",
    "the curve obtained at a temperature of 250k is dashed , to indicate its likely metastability . in agreement with the one - dimensional model , the strength of the hydrophobic interaction increases with increasing temperature , while its range decreases at the same time : an inverse relation is observed between the strength and range of the hydrophobic interaction , althoug less prominently in three dimensions than in one or two . unlike the one - dimensional model , the two- and three - dimensional models show oscillations in the mean force , reflecting the greater geometrical complexity of the lattice in higher dimensions . in that sense , the curves resemble more closely what is seen in models in which the solvent is modeled more realistically @xcite .",
    "in addition to the strong attraction at short distances , there is now also a local minimum in the potential of depth about @xmath0 at a distance of three lattice spacings in two dimensions and one of depth about @xmath1 at a distance of two lattice spacings in three dimensions .",
    ".the function @xmath25 as a function of temperature @xmath4 , for the two - dimensional ( second column ) and three - dimensional model ( third column ) .",
