    "@xcite it is necessary to develop tests that do not perturb the cryogenic environment .",
    "superconductors are perilously sensitive to optical power and dc and ac magnetic fields .",
    "the standard temperature measurements of the atomic cloud mentioned above are inaccessible in these setups due to a lack of optical access or sensitivity to changing magnetic fields . here",
    "we present , as part of our program to magnetically couple atoms trapped around an optical nanofiber to a superconducting resonator  @xcite , a new way to monitor the temperature of a cloud of cold atoms near a nanofiber , using the correlations of fluorescent photons emitted into the nanofiber guided mode .",
    "when the emitters are not stationary , the intensity - intensity correlation function depends on their motion as well as the geometry of the mode into which they emit  @xcite .",
    "the intensity - intensity correlation function , @xmath1 , measures correlations in the fluctuations of light intensity , e.g. the photon statistics  @xcite , and can reveal both classical and quantum aspects of the light and its sources . among the classical effects",
    "is the transit time of atoms through an optical mode .",
    "systems such as atomic beams  @xcite , single atoms in a mot  @xcite , and a single trapped ion  @xcite were used to measure these transit - time effects .",
    "while bunched and antibunched photon statistics have been observed in the light emitted into the onf guided mode  @xcite , the correlations related to atomic trajectories near the onf have been studied only tangentially  @xcite .",

    "its dependence on temperature allows for a simple model to infer the mot temperature directly from the correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : system ] outlines the nanofiber mode structure , potential shifts , and the coupling efficiency of fluorescence photons into the nanofiber .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] provides a general overview of intensity - intensity correlations and briefly discusses the theoretical considerations for calculating and simulating them .",
    "finally section  [ sec : expt ] presents the experimental results and compares them to simulations .",
    "the experiment relies on two main parts : a source of cold @xmath2rb atoms and an onf .",
    "a mot provides a constant source of slowly moving atoms whose fluorescent light can couple evanescently into the guided mode of the optical nanofiber .",

    "this is justified because the fiber is long relative to these effects in one direction so that the atoms see a landscape that is , on average , uniform .",
    "the coupling efficiency of an atom to the onf is the rate of spontaneous emission that couples into the one - dimensional mode of the fiber divided by the total spontaneous emission rate  @xcite , @xmath36 fermi s golden rule determines the form of @xmath37 , which follows the spatial variation of eq .",

    "laser - cooled atoms are not stationary emitters .",
    "the resonance fluorescence emitted into the fundamental mode exhibits correlations due to transit - time effects related to the geometry of that mode .",
    "the atoms act as beacons signaling their position while passing near the nanofiber .",

    "[ eq : g2 ]  @xcite , @xmath48 the function @xmath47 generally depends on the environment and how the emitted light couples to the detection apparatus ",
    "it is the shape of this temporal envelope that will allow us to extract information about the trajectories of atoms moving near an onf .",
    "we can relate the width of the correlation function @xmath1 to the temperature of the atomic cloud by noting that the temperature determines the velocity distribution of the atoms and the speed of the atoms determines the timescale of the interaction with the nanofiber . the onf mode described by eq .",
    "[ eq : intensity ] possesses a characteristic length scale of @xmath49 . dividing this length by a characteristic speed of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of atoms at a temperature @xmath50 , which we take to be the most probable speed , @xmath51 , yields a simple relationship between transit time and temperature : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an overall scale factor based on the geometry of the problem and on our choice of characteristic speed .",
    "we are not able to find an analytical form for @xmath53 from simple physical considerations , but used simulations to understand how geometric details affect @xmath53 ( see sec .  [",

    "we load the mot from the low - velocity tail of a background vapor of @xmath54rb atoms produced by a dispenser ( see details in ref .",
    "we change the intensity and detuning of the cooling beams in order to controllably vary the temperature of the atomic cloud between @xmath55 , as measured by time - of - flight expansion through fluorescence imaging .",
    "our ability to determine the atomic cloud temperatures is limited by the time - of - flight ( tof ) imaging system in our setup combined with the low atom numbers for colder mots in steady state . while we collected correlation data for ostensibly colder mots , we only present data for temperatures for which we could provide calibration to a known technique .",
    "this is an indication that in certain circumstances the signal - to - noise ratio of the correlation measurement technique can be better than that of tof .",
    "the optical nanofiber ( onf ) is produced via the flame brushing technique  @xcite .",
    "a hydrogen - oxygen flame acts as a local heat source to soften @xmath56-diameter , single - mode fiber ( fibercore sm800 ) whose ends are pulled with computer - controlled linear motors .",
    "this method reliably produces fibers of subwavelength diameters with transmission of the fundamental mode above 99% and as high as 99.95% , allowing them to sustain powers of hundreds of milliwatts in high vacuum  @xcite .",
    "based on our fiber - pulling reproducibility , we know the transmission is greater than 95% .",
    "relying on repeated , destructive measurements of the nanofiber diameter using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , we estimate the diameter of our onf to be @xmath57 nm , with a 1% uniformity over a length of 7 mm .",
    "this fiber diameter with the stated uncertainty accepts only one guided mode , described by eq .",
    "[ eq : intensity ] above , at the experimentally relevant wavelength of 780 nm .",
    "this same fiber has been in our apparatus for over two years with no noticeable degradation in quality .",
    "rubidium atoms can coat the fiber surface and reduce transmission under operating pressures , but application of a thru - fiber heating beam with a power of more than a few @xmath0w is sufficient to desorb the atoms within a few ms .",
    "we glue ( epo - tek og116 - 31 ) the fiber to a titanium u - shaped mount for stability , and attach the mount to a uhv - compatible manipulator system ( vg scienta transax ) .",
    "the manipulator consists of a motorized stepper motor along one axis and 2d manual translations stages along the other axes .",
    "this manipulator works in conjunction with three pairs of magnetic shim coils to optimally overlap the nanofiber waist with the region of highest atomic density in the cloud .",
    "light that couples into the guided mode is filtered at the output of the fiber by a volume bragg grating ( vbg , optigrate bp-785 ) , a narrow - line interference filter ( semrock ll01 - 780 - 12.5 ) , and a long - pass color filter ( thorlabs fgl645 ) before being sent to the two fiber - coupled single - photon counting modules ( spcms ) ( see fig .

    "our data is a list of times corresponding to photon detection events , which we use to find @xmath1 .",
    "we do not do any further binning of the data , so that the timing resolution of 20.83 ns is set by the internal clock in the fpga .",
    "while this time resolution obscures details on atomic spontaneous emission timescales ( tens of nanoseconds ) , it provides good resolution on the timescale of a few microseconds where the atomic trajectories produce signatures in the correlation function .",
    "measurements using an oscilloscope ( tektronix dpo 7054 ) with finer time resolution allowed us to observe antibunching for low atom number .",
