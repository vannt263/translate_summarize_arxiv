    "we emphasize several important steps that are relevant to our program of wide - field stellar photometry .",
    "our procedure for producing images free of instrumental signatures involves five steps : data acquisition , aspect correction , exposure - map generation , large - scale sensitivity correction , and image combination .",
    "1 .   data acquisition : raw and pipeline - processed uvot data are downloaded directly from the heasarc archive . ( the same processed uvot data are also available through the mast archive at stsci . )",
    "the pipeline will be described in detail in marshall et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the standard download includes the raw frames , processed images that have been geometrically corrected to sky coordinates , and exposure maps .",
    "we also download auxiliary spacecraft data for reasons given below . 2 .",
    "aspect correction : the heasarc automated processing performs a transformation of the raw ccd images to celestial coordinates , using the spacecraft attitude files ( not the image - header coordinates , which are for the _ nominal _ pointings rather than the _ actual _ pointings ) .",
    "the reduction pipeline then runs uvotaspcorr to match stars in the frame to the usno - b1 astrometric catalog for fine aspect correction .",
    "however , this automated aspect correction is prone to failure in some fields .",
    "the severe crowding , and the sometimes dramatic differences in uv and optical fluxes for late - type stars , can cause this process to fail or ( more rarely ) produce an inaccurate solution .",
    "this is most likely to occur in globular clusters and fields in the magellanic clouds .",
    "+ when the automatic fine aspect correction fails , we manually match stars in each frame to reference images from the stsci digitized sky survey .",
    "we then use the ftools program uvotunicorr to generate a new aspect solution , which is applied to the image if the new scatter in offsets is less than 125 .",
    "we have found that about ten matched stars are needed to produce a sound two - dimensional translation .",
    "the ftool uvotexpmap is then used to regenerate the exposure map at the new coordinates .",
    "exposure map regeneration : the exposure maps are a critical part of any analysis of uvot data . a typical _",
    "swift _ observing window is 6001800  s long .",
    "observations longer than about 1000  s will likely be spread over multiple spacecraft orbits . in our program , the observations have often been spread over weeks , months , or even years .",
    "thus the observations have been taken at a range of spacecraft roll angles .",
    "there is also a range in pointings , at a level of 1@xmath10 .",
    "these factors cause the total exposure time in a combined image of a target to vary significantly over the field , as shown in the left panel of figure [ f : flatfield ] .",
    "+ the exposure map images generated by the heasarc pipeline are , absent aspect correction problems , perfectly suited to this task .",
    "however , we regenerate them in all cases so that we can mask out the outer regions of the uvot images , where the data quality is lower . the first step in this process is to generate a bad - pixel map for each image , using the uvotbadpix tool and the standard bad - pixel map in the most recent calibration database ( caldb ) build .",
    "we then recreate the exposure map using uvotexpmap with the spacecraft attitude files and a simple 25-pixel trim to generate masks that remove the outskirts of each image .",
    "this step is automatically taken when we have to revise the automatic aspect correction for an image .",
    "this trim is more aggressive than used in our standard products or the forthcoming uvot source catalog ( yershov et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , but was chosen to avoid false detections in the image corners . 4 .   large scale sensitivity ( lls ) : uvot data are not corrected in the standard pipeline for flat - field effects .",
    "we make this correction using a sensitivity map , as described in breeveld et al .",
    "this task grows more complicated when stacking multiple images at varying pointings and roll angles .",
    "the first step in correcting for the flat field is to generate individual sensitivity images for each exposure . this task is performed using the ftools task uvotskylss , the lss maps available in caldb , and the spacecraft attitude files .",
    "image combination : the sensitivity maps , exposure maps , and images are then combined into single large multi - extension fits files using the fappend task .",
    "uvotimsum is then used to combine these into a single image , a single exposure map , and a single lss map in each filter , adjusting the combination method as appropriate for each type of image . in each case",
    ", we use the mask files generated during the exposure map reconstruction to produce clean masked images , removing both bad pixels and chip edges .",
    "uvot s photon - counting mode and photon - cloud centroiding of counts complicates the analysis of wide - field photometry in a number of ways .",
    "the problems of coincidence and dead - time losses , in which two or more photons hit a similar detector location during the same read time , or a photon hits during the readout , are addressed in poole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and breeveld et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . however , there are additional secondary effects that can impact psf photometry .",
    "the onboard centroiding of the photon  splashes \" causes the coincidence loss at any pixel to be mixed into adjacent pixels .",
    "this causes the psf to change shape at high count rates , becoming narrower and developing a darkened halo of lower count rates where photons in the outskirts of the psf are lost ( although the overall counts are conserved , so the poole et al .",
    "coincidence loss corrections will still work for fixed aperture photometry ) .",
    "in addition , the clusters we are studying are crowded , with multiple overlapping point sources that complicate both the individual photometric measures and the corrections for coincidence loss .",
    "uvot photometry is generally performed with the ftool uvotsource , which provides single - source aperture photometry , or uvotdetect , which incorporates the source extractor program ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to provide multi - source photometry .",
    "while these tools have their advantages , including automatic correction for coincidence loss , they are not well - suited for images as crowded as in our cluster program fields .",
    "thus we have adapted the daophot / allstar psf photometry program ( stetson 1987 , 1994 ) to the analysis of uvot data .",
    "ideally , software unique to uvot would be developed that accounts for the change of psf shape with count rate . however , as shown below , a psf independent of count rate has proven capable of producing high - quality photometry , providing one selects the psf stars carefully .",
    "we first aperture photometer all stars using a circular aperture of radius 50 .",
    "we then carefully select psf stars that are not near image edges , bright stars , or the  burned in \" areas of the cluster centers .",
    "we also have found that , because uvot is a non - linear detector , removing the bright stars from our psf sample produces significant improvements in the object subtraction and overall photometry .",
    "these stars are most obvious when the coincidence loss produces visible artifacts  dark halos and boxes around bright stars .",
    "however , we have found that an aggressive trimming of the bright end of the psf stars was necessary to produce high - quality photometry .",
    "we allowed the psf to have quadratic variation over the image , although in fact the psf is reasonably constant over the face of the detector .",
    "once this psf star selection stage is completed , we follow standard methods of stellar photometry using the allstar program .",
    "translating the instrumental daophot photometry to calibrated magnitudes , however , involves a number of intermediate steps .",
    "these steps are included in the builds of uvotsource and uvotdetect .",
    "we list these here as they are necessary for any photometric method that assumes linear count rates .    1 .",
    "we convert the daophot instrumental magnitudes and sky measures to raw count rates .",
    "the count rates are corrected for exposure time using the summed exposure map .",
    "we aperture - correct the psf photometry to the standard 50 aperture used for calibration .",
    "it is critical that this step be done before the coincidence - loss correction or the correction will fail to linearize the photometry .",
    "we have found that daophot sometimes produces a small zero - point offset between the aperture photometry and the psf photometry .",
    "this is non - trivial with uvot since the count rates are not linear .",
    "correcting the photometry back to the 50 apertures before the coincidence loss correction removes the non - linearity .",
    "the count rates  total count rate in the aperture ( star plus sky ) and sky count rate  are corrected for coincidence loss using the formulation of poole et al .",
    "we then subtract the corrected sky rate from the corrected total count rate to produce a coincidence - loss corrected count rate for each star .",
    "the count rates are then corrected for the large - scale sensitivity and the secular decline in instrument sensitivity , using the large - scale sensitivity map and formulations from breeveld et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , respectively .",
    "6 .   finally , we convert the count rates back to stellar magnitudes and apply the zero - point corrections of breeveld et al .",
    "zero - points are available for both vega - based magnitudes and ab  magnitudes .",
    "to test the internal consistency of the pipeline , we compared deep photometry of the open cluster m  67 ( described in  [ s : results ] ) to photometry from shallower images taken in windowed mode .",
    "the windowed mode , which images the inner @xmath11 region of the uvot field , significantly shortens the read and dead times of the array , reducing the coincidence losses for bright targets . figure [ f : windowcomp ] shows the comparison for five of the six uvot filters ( no windowed data were obtained in the @xmath5 filter ) . in all five cases , fits to weighted residuals",
    "show that the comparisons are flat to within 12% and statistically consistent with a flat trend , confirming the accuracy of the poole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) coincidence - loss corrections ( the comparisons appear non - linear at the faint end due to poorly measured stars being preferentially detected when they scatter to brighter magnitudes in the windowed frame ) .",

    "<S> we describe the motivations and background of a large survey of nearby stellar populations using the ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ) aboard the _ swift gamma - ray burst mission_. uvot , with its wide field , nuv sensitivity , and 23 spatial resolution , is uniquely suited to studying nearby stellar populations and providing insight into the nuv properties of hot stars and the contribution of those stars to the integrated light of more distant stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we review the state of uv stellar photometry , outline the survey , and address problems specific to wide- and crowded - field uvot photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we present color - magnitude diagrams of the nearby open clusters m  67 , ngc  188 , and ngc  2539 , and the globular cluster m  79 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that uvot can easily discern the young- and intermediate - age main sequences , blue stragglers , and hot white dwarfs , producing results consistent with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that it characterizes the blue horizontal branch of m  79 and easily identifies a known post - asymptotic giant branch star . </S>"
