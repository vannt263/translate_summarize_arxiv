    "one of the major paradigms of quantum chaos is the conjecture of bohigas , giannoni and schmit ( bgs ) @xcite which states that the local statistics of energy spectra of ( generic ) individual quantum systems , whose classical analogues exhibit ( strongly ) chaotic behaviour , can be well described by that of ensembles of large random matrices .",
    "the symmetry properties of the relevant matrix ensembles have to be chosen according to the symmetries of the quantum system under consideration . in case",
    "the system is invariant under time reversal and has integer total angular momentum its local eigenvalue statistics are conjectured to be that of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "if time reversal invariance is broken one expects local statistics according to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .    however , if the total angular momentum of the system is half - integer and the system is invariant under time reversal all eigenvalues show kramers degeneracy @xcite and their statistics have to be compared with the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) . in the goe- and in the gue - case there is plenty of numerical evidence available in favour of the bgs - conjecture , see , e.g. , @xcite , whereas only few examples have been studied in the gse - case as , e.g. , in @xcite . for quantum systems",
    "whose classical limit is integrable , i.e. , which shows regular behaviour , one expects the local eigenvalue statistics to follow the laws of a poisson process @xcite . for the analytical treatment",
    "semiclassical methods , in particular semiclassical trace formulae , have become the most important tools since berry and tabor @xcite investigated the behaviour of the spectral form factor for classically integrable systems by means of an appropriate trace formula . by making use of the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite ,",
    "berry provided a semiclassical theory for the spectral form factor @xcite of classically chaotic systems without spin .",
    "based on the so - called diagonal approximation he could explain the semiclassical asymptotics of the form factor for small values of its argument , thus recovering the goe- and gue - behaviour , respectively .    in this paper",
    "our aim is to show that berry s semiclassical treatment of the two - point form factor can be carried over to quantum systems with spin 1/2 , whose classical translational dynamics are chaotic .",
    "we base our analysis on the semiclassical trace formula for the dirac equation that we developed recently @xcite . in this trace formula",
    "the presence of spin is reflected in a modification of the amplitudes with which the periodic orbits of the translational dynamics contribute .",
    "this modification arises from a spin dynamics that involves a ` classical ' spin precessing along the periodic orbits .",
    "the central part of this paper therefore consists of calculating the effect of this spin contribution to the semiclassical form factor . for our analysis",
    "we use a two - point form factor whose definition differs slightly from the one that is more commonly used in spectral statistics as , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we rather prefer the point of view adopted in @xcite .",
    "both definitions , however , are equivalent in the limit where infinitely many eigenvalues are taken into account .",
    "we also stress that both the form factor and the associated correlation function are distributions and hence have to be evaluated on suitable test functions .",
    "this approach makes a spectral average obsolete and enables one to state the bgs - conjecture , specialized to the form factor , in a precise manner .",
    "moreover , the lacking self - averaging property discussed in @xcite poses no difficulty in this context .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ 2sec ]",
    "we introduce our definition of the spectral form factor for a finite part of the spectrum and discuss in which sense one can expect to recover the form factors given by random matrix theory .",
    "section [ 3sec ] is devoted to the definition of a regularized form factor which we evaluate semiclassically using trace formulae for the dirac as well as for the pauli equation @xcite .",
    "we also invoke the diagonal approximation and briefly discuss its range of validity . in section [ 4sec ] a suitable version of the equidistribution principle of long periodic orbits",
    "is used in order to obtain the semiclassical asymptotics of the diagonal form factor . in this context",
    "we employ the notion of a skew product of the translational and the spin dynamics , the ergodic properties of which determine the semiclassical asymptotics .",
    "our principal results are then summarized in section 5 .",
    "namely , depending on the presence or absence of quantum mechanical time reversal invariance , and provided the dynamics of the skew product is mixing , we can recover a gse- or gue - behaviour of the diagonal form factor , respectively . the relation between classical and quantum mechanical time reversal as well as the equidistribution of long periodic orbits",
    "are discussed in two appendices .",
    "the two - point correlations of a discrete quantum spectrum are conveniently measured by either the two - point correlation function @xmath0 or by the two - point form factor @xmath1 , which is related to @xmath0 through a fourier transform . before defining these quantities one usually _ unfolds _ the spectrum , i.e. , the eigenvalues @xmath2 are rescaled to @xmath3 such that the unfolded eigenvalues have a mean separation of one .",
    "this means that the spectral density @xmath4 of the unfolded spectrum allows for a separation @xmath5 such that @xmath6 vanishes as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . for a finite part of the spectrum , containing @xmath10",
    "unfolded eigenvalues enumerated as @xmath11 , one defines the two - level correlation function by @xmath12 accordingly , the two - level form factor is defined as @xmath13 since both quantities are distributions , which is most clearly seen in the case of the correlation function ( [ rsub2n ] ) , one should evaluate these on test functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 we remark that since the form factor is obviously even in @xmath16 , it suffices to consider only even test functions @xmath17 . the convention for the fourier transform that was used , and that will be used in all of what follows ,",
    "is @xmath18 after smearing with a test function all expressions occurring in ( [ rsub2ntest ] ) are obviously finite . in this form",
    "a semiclassical analysis of either the form factor or the correlation function can be carried out .",
    "if @xmath17 is chosen non - negative , the left - hand side of ( [ rsub2ntest ] ) can also be viewed as the mean value of @xmath19 when @xmath16 is drawn randomly with probability density @xmath17 .",
    "since we always understand the form factor in the above sense , the absence of a self - averaging property discussed in @xcite is not essential for our further considerations .",
    "for a given quantum hamiltonian @xmath20 the unfolding of its discrete spectrum shall proceed in the following manner .",
    "we consider a spectral interval @xmath21 \\ , \\quad \\omega > 0 \\ , \\ ] ] that has no overlap with a possible essential spectrum of @xmath20 .",
    "then the condition @xmath22 is equivalent to @xmath23 the number of eigenvalues contained in @xmath24 , @xmath25 can be estimated semiclassically as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes an appropriate mean spectral density and @xmath28 is the _ heisenberg - time_. a convenient definition of @xmath27 can be derived from the semiclassical trace formula for @xmath20 in that it shall denote the contribution coming from the singularity of @xmath29 $ ] at @xmath30 to all polynomial orders in @xmath31 see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the spectra that we are going to consider below are such that in the semiclassical limit @xmath32 the heisenberg - time tends to infinity , @xmath33 .",
    "for example , given @xmath34 in the gap of the essential spectrum of a dirac - hamiltonian @xmath35 , i.e. , in typical cases @xmath36 , the mean spectral density reads @xcite @xmath37\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 denote the hypersurfaces of energy @xmath34 in phase space corresponding to the classical hamiltonians @xmath39 for relativistic particles of positive and negative kinetic energy , respectively , in the static external electromagnetic fields generated by the potentials @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , in the semiclassical limit the number of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath24 increases , although its length @xmath42 shrinks to zero .",
    "a completely analogous argument applies to pauli - hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "we now define the unfolded spectrum through @xmath43 the condition @xmath44 is hence equivalent to @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 . with this choice indeed @xmath7 , @xmath8 , such that @xmath47 in the semiclassical limit . in this context",
    "the quantity ( [ dfldef ] ) reads @xmath48 such that ( [ nisemicl ] ) ensures its vanishing in the semiclassical limit .    from now on we will choose the numbering of the eigenvalues @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , in such a way that the eigenvalues in @xmath24 are given by @xmath49 changing the value of @xmath31 therefore alters the numbering of the eigenvalues . as a consequence ,",
    "the condition @xmath22 is equivalent to @xmath50 . at this place",
    "we recall that the semiclassical limit @xmath32 , or @xmath33 , implies @xmath51 . for the form factor ( [ ksub2n ] )",
    "we now obtain @xmath52 }                    \\left(\\frac{e_k -e}{\\hbar}\\right)\\,\\rme^{-\\frac{\\rmi}{\\hbar }                    \\tau t_h e_k}\\right|^2 - \\delta ( \\tau ) \\ , } \\ ] ] where the @xmath53-sum extends over all eigenvalues of @xmath54 and @xmath55}$ ] denotes the characteristic function of the interval @xmath56 $ ] that occurs due to the condition ( [ esubkini ] ) .    in the preceding discussion we tacitly assumed that the discrete spectrum of the quantum hamiltonian carries no systematic degeneracies",
    "in order to achieve such a situation one has to remove all symmetries . as opposed to geometric or internal symmetries that have to be realized by unitary representations of the respective symmetry groups , the time reversal operation must be implemented by an anti - unitary operator @xmath57 , see @xcite and [ apptr ] .",
    "for single particles of spin @xmath58 the square of @xmath57 depends on @xmath58 being integer or half - integer in that @xmath59 . in case",
    "the quantum system is time reversal invariant , i.e. , @xmath60=0 $ ] , and has half - integer spin this leads to _ kramers degeneracy _",
    "@xcite : since @xmath61 implies that every vector @xmath62 in the hilbert space is orthogonal to @xmath63 , all eigenvalues of @xmath20 are ( at least ) two - fold degenerate , see @xcite for details .    following the usual practice",
    ", we will remove kramers degeneracy by replacing each degenerate pair @xmath64 of eigenvalues by one of its representatives .",
    "thus the mean spectral density is lowered by a factor of two .",
    "in analogy to ( [ defoldef ] ) the unfolding @xmath65 of the so modified spectrum can therefore be achieved through the choice @xmath66 .",
    "the modified form factor then reads @xmath67 in this setting the conjecture of bohigas , giannoni and schmit @xcite states that for individual ( generic ) classically chaotic quantum systems of particles with half - integer total spin and no unitary symmetries one should obtain @xmath68 for all test functions @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 denotes the two - point form factor of the gaussian symplectic ensemble of random matrix theory , @xmath71 see , e.g. , @xcite . when time reversal invariance is lacking , the respective conjecture reads @xmath72 where now the form factor of the gaussian unitary ensemble @xcite should occur , @xmath73 in our subsequent semiclassical investigations we will in both cases , i.e. , with and without time reversal invariance , consider the form factor @xmath74 as it is given in ( [ ksub2nsubi ] ) .",
    "when dealing with the case of time reversal invariance we appeal to the relation ( [ ffmod ] ) .",
    "since the work of berry and tabor @xcite on the distribution of eigenvalues for classically integrable systems , semiclassical trace formulae have found numerous and fruitful applications in the analysis of spectral statistics . a prominent example is berry s analysis of the spectral rigidity @xcite , which relies in an essential way on a semiclassical evaluation of the two - point form factor based on the gutzwiller trace formula . in this work",
    "it already became apparent that present semiclassical methods at most allow to study the form factor in the restricted range @xmath75 , see also @xcite for a review . only recently",
    ", improved techniques have been developed @xcite that might allow to extend the semiclassical analysis of spectral statistics . in this paper , however , we follow the more traditional path in that in the end we consider the so - called diagonal approximation for the form factor .    the two - point form factor as given in ( [ ksub2nsubi ] ) requires to establish a trace formula for the sum @xmath76}\\left(\\frac{e_k -e}{\\hbar}\\right)\\ , \\rme^{-\\frac{\\rmi}{\\hbar}\\tau t_h e_k } \\ .\\ ] ] however , the general structure of ( convergent ) semiclassical trace formulae , see , e.g. , @xcite , necessitates the use of a smooth test function @xmath77 with fourier transform @xmath78 .",
    "one therefore has to replace the sharp cut - off , provided by the characteristic function in ( [ traceform ] ) , by a smoothened substitute .",
    "for this reason we now introduce the _ regularized form factor _",
    "@xmath79 where @xmath80 is a test function with fourier transform @xmath81 , but that is otherwise arbitrary at the moment .",
    "later we will introduce a further normalization condition . in the following",
    "we will consider both relativistic and non - relativistic particles with spin 1/2 . in the relativistic case ,",
    "when one is dealing with a dirac - hamiltonian @xmath35 , the function @xmath82 , which is not to be confused with the characteristic function @xmath55}$ ] , is necessary to truncate the essential spectrum of @xmath35 . in typical situations",
    "@xmath83 should therefore be supported in the interval @xmath84 , where the eigenvalues @xmath2 of @xmath35 are located .",
    "when these do not accumulate at some point , one could also leave out the truncation @xmath83 from ( [ regformf ] ) .",

    "the inner sum then is over all @xmath53-fold repetitions of primitive orbits , formally including negative ones .",
    "the weight attached to each pair @xmath89 reads @xmath90 \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath91 su(2 ) denotes the semiclassical time evolution operator for the spin degrees of freedom along the primitive periodic orbit @xmath87 of the translational dynamics .",
    "furthermore , @xmath92 denotes the action of @xmath87 and @xmath93 is its maslov index .",
    "the ( monodromy ) matrix @xmath94 is the linearized poincar map transversal to @xmath87 . in the form given in ( [ diractf ] ) the trace formula is valid for all cases where the classical flows have only isolated and non - degenerate periodic orbits .",
    "an analogous trace formula , with appropriate simplifications , is also available for pauli - hamiltonians , see @xcite .    upon choosing the test function ( [ tracetestfct ] ) in the trace formula ( [ diractf ] ) ,",
    "its left - hand side reads @xmath95 and is hence the appropriate starting point for a semiclassical analysis of the form factor , compare ( [ regformf ] ) .",
    "as a first ingredient on the right - hand side of ( [ diractf ] ) one requires the fourier transform of the test function ( [ tracetestfct ] ) , which is given by @xmath96 for convenience we now choose @xmath97 to be even and real - valued , which implies that @xmath98 also shares these properties .",
    "furthermore , the truncation @xmath83 of the essential spectrum shall be such that @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the trace formula yields the following semiclassical representation of the regularized form factor , @xmath100 ^ 2 \\ , [ 1+\\or(\\hbar ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\    & + \\sum_\\gamma\\sum_{k\\neq 0}\\frac{t_\\gamma}{4\\pi\\omega}\\,\\hat\\eta       ( \\tau t_h)\\,\\hat\\eta(kt_\\gamma -\\tau t_h)\\,a_{\\gamma , k } \\ ,        [ 1+\\or(\\hbar ) ]   \\\\    & + \\frac{1}{t_h}\\sum_{\\gamma,\\gamma'}\\sum_{k , k'\\neq 0 }       \\frac{t_\\gamma t_{\\gamma'}}{4\\pi\\omega}\\,\\hat\\eta(kt_\\gamma -\\tau        t_h)\\,\\hat\\eta(\\tau t_h -k't_{\\gamma'})\\,a_{\\gamma , k}\\,a_{\\gamma',-k ' }       \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a next step we are going to test the semiclassical form factor with some @xmath14 , compare ( [ rsub2ntest ] ) . to this end",

    "furthermore , since the fourier transform @xmath98 of the test function @xmath97 is required to be compactly supported , the second line is a finite sum , multiplied by @xmath112 .",
    "a similar argument applies to the third and fourth line , apart from the _ diagonal contribution _ with @xmath113 , where @xmath114 occurs and thus no such cut - off is present .    due to the above reasoning it is tempting to assume that in the semiclassical limit @xmath33 the right - hand side of ( [ regformtest ] ) is completely fixed by the contribution of the _ diagonal form factor _ @xmath115 here we assumed that @xmath116 implies @xmath117 , see [ apptr ] for the spin contribution , and then @xmath118 denotes the number of pairs @xmath89 such that @xmath119 has a given value .",
    "it is , however , well known that the above assumption is not justified .",
    "the reason for this lies in the subtleties of the limits involved . in order to arrive at the left - hand side of ( [ bgswitht ] ) , or of ( [ bgsnot ] ) ,",
    "one first has to remove the smoothening of the characteristic function @xmath55}$ ] in that a sequence of functions @xmath120 approaching @xmath55}$ ] has to be considered .",
    "then , in the limit , @xmath121 is no longer compactly supported . indeed , according to ( [ convo ] ) one obtains @xmath122 .",
    "still , the periodic - orbit sums in ( [ regformtest ] ) are truncated by the test function @xmath17 . however , in the semiclassical limit this cut - off is being removed . moreover , for long periodic orbits the differences @xmath123 can become arbitrarily small so that @xmath124 only provides a modest truncation of near - diagonal contributions .",
    "the only example where it could be rigorously shown @xcite that the diagonal form factor itself produces the correct limit , if the test functions @xmath17 are restricted to those that are supported in the interval @xmath125 $ ] , is that of the correlations of the non - trivial zeros of principal @xmath126-functions , including the case of the riemann zeta function , see also @xcite .",
    "rudnick and sarnak @xcite even proved an analogous result for general @xmath127-point correlations .",
    "as announced previously , we now invoke the diagonal approximation , i.e. , we leave aside the contribution of @xmath128 to ( [ regformtest ] ) .",
    "this procedure , which goes back to berry @xcite , is generally supposed to reveal the correct behaviour of the form factor for small @xmath129 .",
    "the reason for this being that if the test function @xmath17 is supported in a small interval , the contribution of long periodic orbits to ( [ regformtest ] ) is truncated .",
    "furthermore , due to the normalization ( [ chinorm ] ) the diagonal form factor is independent of the smoothening @xmath97 .",
    "this convenient fact exempts one from the need to discuss the removal of this smoothening . in",
    "order to test now the range of small @xmath129 one should restrict the class of test functions @xmath17 to those supported in intervals @xmath130 $ ] , where @xmath131 is ` small enough ' . recalling that @xmath132 and @xmath17 are even in @xmath16 an integration by parts yields",
    "@xmath133 ) as @xmath33 . since the contributions of repetitions of primitive periodic orbits are asymptotically suppressed due to their stronger instabilities , compare also ( [ detmasy ] ) below , in the following we only take the @xmath134term of the sum over the repetitions into account . as a consequence we therefore have to study the asymptotics of the periodic - orbit sum @xmath135 in the double limit @xmath33 , @xmath136 , such that @xmath137 . in order to simplify this task",
    "we now make two assumptions , which should be verified in all cases that could be considered as ` generic ' in any reasonable sense :    1 .",
    "the periods @xmath88 of primitive periodic orbits shall be such that any finite subset of them is linearly independent over @xmath138 .",
    "this implies that the multiplicities @xmath118 are independent of @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath139 .",
    "the subset of primitive periodic orbits @xmath87 with @xmath140 is of density zero in the set of all primitive periodic orbits , @xmath141 where @xmath142 in case the classical dynamics are time reversal invariant , and @xmath143 when time reversal symmetry is absent . in this context time reversal invariance",
    "does not only mean that an orbit @xmath87 is geometrically identical to its time reversed partner , but also that both orbits yield the same contribution of the spin degrees of freedom to the trace formula , which then implies that @xmath144 is invariant under time reversal . in [ apptr ]",
    "we show that this condition is a consequence of quantum mechanical time reversal invariance .    under these assumptions",
    "the factors @xmath118 can be replaced by @xmath145 and can then be pulled out of the sum ( [ posumest ] ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to obtain the leading semiclassical behaviour of the periodic - orbit sum ( [ posumest ] ) . apart from the appearance of the heisenberg - time",
    "only quantities related to the classical flow enter this expression .",
    "it therefore seems appropriate to invoke results about the distribution of periodic orbits in phase space . in order to retain a certain convenient generality",
    ", we will not specify the classical translational dynamics further , except for the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the classical flow @xmath146 on the compact hypersurface @xmath147 of energy @xmath34 in the @xmath148-dimensional phase space is generated by some hamiltonian function @xmath149 and hence preserves the ( normalized ) liouville measure @xmath150 on @xmath147 .",
    "2 .   @xmath151 is _ ergodic _ with respect to liouville measure .",
    "@xmath151 is _ hyperbolic _ on all of @xmath147 .    in the case of the semiclassical form factor for a dirac - hamiltonian",
    "these requirements shall apply to both classical flows , i.e. , to those generated by the two classical hamiltonians @xmath152 given in ( [ classham ] ) .",
    "moreover , we now assume that for a given energy @xmath34 there will only be either a contribution coming from the dynamics generated by @xmath153 or from the dynamics generated by @xmath154 , but never from both at the same time .",
    "this is not a strong restriction since it only excludes situations in which klein s paradox @xcite can appear .",
    "the hyperbolicity of the classical flows implies that in particular all periodic orbits are either hyperbolic or loxodromic .",
    "this means that all monodromy matrices @xmath94 have eigenvalues with moduli strictly different from one .",
    "since the eigenvalues occur in pairs of mutually inverse numbers , we denote them as @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "thus @xmath159 the stability exponents @xmath160 are related to the lyapunov exponents @xmath161 of @xmath87 through @xmath162 so that @xmath163 as @xmath164 .",
    "hence , in this limit one obtains @xmath165 since the semiclassical limit of the periodic - orbit sum ( [ posumest ] ) is dominated by the contribution of long periodic orbits , ( [ detmasy ] ) allows to analyze ( [ posumest ] ) in terms of periodic - orbits sums that are familiar from equidistribution theorems of periodic orbits , see , e.g. , @xcite .    for the kind of hamiltonian flows characterized above mean values of observables on @xmath147 with respect to liouville measure can be calculated with the help of appropriate periodic - orbit sums .",
    "we postpone a detailed discussion of this matter to [ appsumrules ] , from which we here only quote that for any continuous observable @xmath166 one obtains the representation @xmath167 where @xmath168 denotes an average of @xmath166 along the periodic orbit @xmath87 , @xmath169 we remark that a heuristic derivation of an analogous identity to ( 4.4 ) was given by hannay and ozorio de almeida @xcite .",
    "one can apply the relation ( [ ameanbypo ] ) to determine the leading semiclassical behaviour of ( [ posumest ] ) once one has chosen a suitable observable @xmath166 whose average @xmath168 yields the quantity @xmath170 appearing in ( [ posumest ] ) .",
    "this , however , can only be achieved in an indirect manner . our choice of the observable requires to recall the semiclassical time evolution of the spin degrees of freedom along the trajectories of the classical flow @xmath151 .",

    "@xmath174 is a certain hermitian and traceless @xmath175matrix valued function on @xmath147 , whose precise form depends on the quantum hamiltonian under consideration , see @xcite for details .",
    "geometrically , @xmath176 can also be interpreted as a parallel transporter in some vector bundle so that @xmath177 , with @xmath178 , is the holonomy associated with the periodic orbit @xmath87 . since its trace is invariant under a shift of the initial point @xmath178 along the orbit , one can introduce the notation @xmath179 .",

    "we can hence now employ ( [ ameanbypo ] ) to deduce the asymptotic relation @xmath185 which is valid for any @xmath181 .",

    "since the @xmath186-dependence involves @xmath197 one might anticipate that the limit @xmath195 of ( [ barae ] ) depends on certain ergodic properties of the spin dynamics .",
    "the latter being considered along trajectories of the translational dynamics , one hence has to combine both dynamics in a suitable way .",
    "in ergodic theory the relevant construction is known as a _ skew product _ ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "appropriate ergodic properties of the skew product dynamics will then allow for a determination of the asymptotic behaviour of ( [ barae ] ) .",

    "the initial condition @xmath203 is obviously fulfilled , and the composition law @xmath204 immediately follows from the relation @xmath205 that can be concluded from ( [ spintrans ] ) . on @xmath206 one then defines the direct product @xmath207 of liouville measure @xmath208 and of the normalized haar measure @xmath209 of @xmath210 .",
    "we recall that the latter is the _ unique _",
    "normalized left- and right - invariant positive radon measure on the group manifold , see , e.g. , @xcite . due to both the invariance of liouville measure under the hamiltonian flow @xmath211 and the left - invariance of haar measure , the product measure @xmath212 is invariant under @xmath198 . a dynamical system of this kind is known as an su(2)-extension of @xmath211 or , more generally , a skew product .",
    "the spin dynamics defined by ( [ spintrans ] ) is then called a cocycle for @xmath211 with values in su(2 ) . for further information",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in addition to the assumptions made for @xmath211 in section [ 3sec ] , in the following we will assume that @xmath198 is ( strongly ) mixing .",
    "this implies that for any @xmath213 @xmath214 we remark that usually the mixing property is defined for pairs of functions @xmath215 .",
    "however , if one views @xmath216 as @xmath217 and introduces a tensor - product basis , ( [ skewmix ] ) follows immediately because every element of this basis fulfills the usual mixing property .",

    "in section [ 3sec ] we demonstrated how the two - point form factor for a quantum system with spin 1/2 can be analyzed semiclassically by making use of an appropriate trace formula .",
    "the diagonal approximation led us to the periodic - orbit sum ( [ posumest ] ) whose asymptotics determines the behaviour of the diagonal form factor for small @xmath16 in the semiclassical limit .",
    "our conclusion ( [ kdiagresult ] ) now has to be compared with the relevant random matrix results ( [ ffgse ] ) and ( [ ffgue ] ) . to this end",
    "we have to distinguish time reversal invariant quantum hamiltonians from non - invariant ones . but let us first summarize our findings . in [ apptr ] we show that quantum mechanical time reversal invariance implies that not only the classical translational dynamics are time reversal invariant but , moreover , the spin dynamics behave in such a way that also the amplitudes @xmath144 appearing in the semiclassical trace formula are invariant under time reversal .",
    "this leads to the occurrence of the multiplicities @xmath118 in the expression ( [ posumest ] ) .",
    "then , when the generic conditions stated at the end of section [ 3sec ] are met , we can pull out the factors @xmath118 from the sum and replace them by either @xmath142 , if ( quantum mechanical ) time reversal invariance is present , or else by @xmath143 . if , furthermore , the translational dynamics are ergodic and hyperbolic , the equidistribution of periodic orbits allowed us to determine the spin contribution to the amplitudes @xmath144 .",
    "we further requested the skew product of the translational and the spin dynamics to be mixing .",
    "this then enabled us to identify the distribution of the traces of the spin - transport matrices and to calculate its second moment , which enters through the amplitudes @xmath144 .    hence",
    ", if quantum mechanical time reversal invariance is absent , the diagonal approximation ( [ kdiagresult ] ) states that @xmath238 , which is identical with the diagonal approximation in the case of schrdinger operators @xcite and coincides with the small-@xmath16 asymptotics of the gue - form factor ( [ ffgue ] ) .",
    "if , however , the quantum hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal so that we have to choose @xmath239 , the diagonal approximation becomes @xmath240 .",
    "according to ( [ ffmod ] ) kramers degeneracy then forces us to compare the random matrix form factor with the modified semiclassical result @xmath241 which now coincides with the small-@xmath16 asymptotics of the gse - form factor ( [ ffgse ] ) . in both cases",
    "this is exactly the behaviour that is predicted by the conjecture of bohigas , giannoni and schmit as stated in ( [ bgsnot ] ) and ( [ bgswitht ] ) .",

    "in this appendix we are going to discuss the relation between classical and quantum mechanical time reversal for systems with spin 1/2 .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the conventional time reversal operation that leaves the position coordinates unchanged and reverses momentum and spin coordinates as well as the time @xmath181 .",
    "the discussion of generalized time reversal operators that combine conventional time reversal with another unitary symmetry operation is analogous , see @xcite for examples .",
    "to be specific we consider as a quantum hamiltonian for a particle of mass @xmath242 , charge @xmath243 and spin 1/2 either a dirac - hamiltonian @xmath244 or a ( generalized ) pauli - hamiltonian @xmath245 in the relativistic case ( [ hdirac ] ) the dirac algebra is realized by the @xmath246 matrices @xmath247 where @xmath248 denotes the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath249 is a @xmath175 unit matrix .",
    "the non - relativistic hamiltonian ( [ hpauli ] ) is composed of a schrdinger operator @xmath250 and a coupling term of spin to the translational degrees of freedom . the latter has to be understood as the quantization of some @xmath251-valued function @xmath252 on phase space . for example , this can be a magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath253 , or a spin - orbit coupling term @xmath254 .    for systems with spin 1/2",
    "the operator of time reversal is given by @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the operator of complex conjugation in position representation , see @xcite .",
    "in the relativistic case , where @xmath57 has to act on four component spinors , ( [ tdef ] ) shall mean a block diagonal @xmath246 matrix with two copies of ( [ tdef ] ) in the diagonal blocks . a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath20 to be time reversal invariant requires @xmath257 .",
    "thus , in the case of a dirac - hamiltonian ( [ hdirac ] ) @xmath258 shows that conventional time reversal invariance is equivalent to the absence of magnetic forces . for the pauli - hamiltonian ( [ hpauli ] ) to commute with @xmath57 we first need the schrdinger operator @xmath250 to be time reversal invariant , i.e. , @xmath259 .",
    "in addition , the condition @xmath260 has to be met , i.e. , the coupling term @xmath252 must be an odd function of momentum @xmath261 .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled by the spin - orbit coupling term @xmath262 , but is violated by the coupling @xmath263 to an external magnetic field . in both the relativistic and the non - relativistic situation , however , even the presence of a magnetic field might allow for the existence of an anti - unitary operator representing a generalized time reversal symmetry that commutes with the hamiltonian , see @xcite .",
    "we now want to investigate the implications of a quantum mechanical time reversal invariance for the semiclassical analysis of the form factor .",
    "the first obvious consequence is a time reversal invariance of the classical translational dynamics .",
    "but furthermore , also the spin dynamics , governed by the spin transport equation ( [ spintrans ] ) , exhibits a certain kind of symmetry under time reversal . in order to discuss the latter",
    ", one has to study the behaviour of the matrix @xmath174 entering ( [ spintrans ] ) under @xmath264 , @xmath265 . for a pauli - hamiltonian @xmath174",
    "is given by @xmath266 , where @xmath252 is defined as above , and for a dirac - hamiltonian with no magnetic field one finds @xmath267 , see @xcite for details .",
    "in each case quantum mechanical time reversal invariance therefore implies @xmath268 .",
    "substituting now @xmath269 and @xmath270 in ( [ spintrans ] ) one obtains @xmath271 since the translational dynamics are time reversal invariant , @xmath174 being odd in the momentum variable leads to @xmath272 and therefore @xmath273 .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath274 is a holonomy implies @xmath275^{-1}$ ] so that finally @xmath276 . altogether",
    "the above considerations confirm that the presence of a quantum mechanical time reversal invariance implies that a primitive periodic orbit @xmath87 and its time reversed partner share identical amplitudes @xmath144 .",
    "in this appendix we want to show how the periodic - orbit representation ( [ ameanbypo ] ) of liouville measure can be obtained from equidistribution properties of periodic orbits . the basic reference for the following is @xcite .",
    "our assumptions on the flow @xmath211 are as stated in .    in order to proceed",
    "further we first have to introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath277 denote the set of all @xmath211-invariant borel probability measures on @xmath147 .",
    "any @xmath278 can be associated a metric entropy @xmath279 .",
    "then for any hlder - continuous observable @xmath280 , with some @xmath281 , the topological pressure is defined as @xmath282 the supremum is attained for a unique measure @xmath283 , which is called _ equilibrium measure _ for the observable @xmath284 .",
    "the periodic orbits of the flow @xmath211 are then equidistributed with respect to @xmath283 in the following sense , @xmath285 for every @xmath286 .",
    "the averages over periodic orbits are defined as in ( [ ameanpo ] ) .    in a next step",
    "one has to identify liouville measure as the equilibrium measure of some observable @xmath284 .",
    "to this end we consider the tangential map @xmath287 restricted to the unstable subbundle @xmath288 of the tangent bundle @xmath289 and define @xmath290 a direct calculation then yields @xmath291 compare ( [ detmasy ] ) . furthermore , the equilibrium measure associated with the observable ( [ defg ] ) is called _ sinai - ruelle - bowen _ measure @xmath292 , for which it is known that for every @xmath286 @xmath293 holds for a set of initial conditions @xmath230 with positive liouville measure , see @xcite for more information .",

    "what is still lacking is an asymptotic estimate of the denominator on the right - hand side of ( [ eqdisg ] ) . in order to obtain this",
