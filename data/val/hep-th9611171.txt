    "generally covariant ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theories provide convenient framework for considering various suspected properties of quantum gravity in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . in particular , the long standing issue of the possible role of topology changing transitions and baby universes@xcite may be naturally discussed in this framework .",
    "a special feature of ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions which is useful for the study of baby universes / wormholes is that some models admit their interpretation as string theories in higher dimensional target space .",
    "the simplest model of this sort is literally the theory of closed strings in the minkowski target space of critical dimensions@xcite .",
    "indeed , macroscopic and microscopic string states may be interpreted as ( 1 + 1)-dimensional parent and baby universes , respectively .",
    "one feature inherent in that model is that the emission of a baby universe always requires non - conservation of bare energy in the parent universe@xcite .",
    "this non - conservation does not lead to any drastic consequences in the simplest stringy model ; in particular , the rate of emission of baby strings is finite in the limit of infinite size of the parent string@xcite .",
    "however , one important feature present in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional gravity is missing in the simplest stringy model .",
    "namely , in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions there exists long ranged gravitational field whose source in energy  momentum ( newton s gravity law ) , while there is no such field in that stringy model .",
    "intuitively , one may suspect that the existence of the long ranged field associated with energy and momentum may be an obstacle to energy non - conservation in local processes like the emission of baby universes . to address this issue , more refined model than that of closed strings in critical dimensions ,",
    "is needed .    a particularly simple ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model where the mass ( energy  momentum of matter fields ) produces long range effects , is the dilaton gravity with matter that has been widely discussed from the point of view of black hole physics@xcite ( for careful analysis of the notion of adm mass in that model see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "here we take a different attitude and consider the emission of baby universes , so we simplify the model as much as possible .",
    "in particular , we set the number of matter fields equal to 24 and the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional cosmological constant to zero . as stressed in refs.@xcite , this model is equivalent to bosonic string theory ( in critical dimension @xmath0 of target space ) in linear dilaton background ( to distinguish between dilaton fields in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional world and in @xmath1-dimensional target space , we call the former `` dilaton '' and the latter `` dilaton '' , respectively ) .",
    "hence , the emission of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional baby universe by a parent universe has an interpretation from the @xmath1-dimensional point of view as the emission of a light string state by a highly excited string state , in complete analogy to ref.@xcite .",
    "this process , in the leading order of string perturbation theory , is tractable both qualitatively and quantitatively ; in particular , one is able to analyze whether it is accompanied by non - conservation of ( bare ) energy in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions and whether its rate is large ( unsuppressed ) when baby universes are emitted locally in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional parent universe .",
    "the discussion of these points is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model and some of its classical solutions in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions . for technical reasons ,",
    "the quantum version is conventiently constructed for the case of closed ( 1 + 1)-dimensional universe , so we present in section 2 some classical solutions in the closed universe",
    ". this discussion will be useful to understand that the ( bare ) energy of localized distributions of matter fields still produces long ranged effects , at least in some gauges , even though the total energy of the closed universe is always zero . in section 3",
    "we outline the quantum version of this model , which is known for some time ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) , construct the states of parent universes ( ddf states ) and vertex operators corresponding to the emission of baby universes .",
    "section 4 contains the main results of this paper .",
    "we consider the simplest ddf state of the parent universe , which can be interpreted as containing just two dressed matter `` particles '' , and analyze the emission of baby universes by this state in the lowest order of string perturbation theory .",
    "we find that this emission always occurs with non - conservation of energy of matter in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional parent universe .",
    "we then proceed to the explicit calculation of the emission rate .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the rate is unsuppressed even for localized distribution of matter in the parent universe , in spite of the long range field this matter produces . in section 5",
    "we conclude by presenting a scenario showing that the non - conservation of bare energy of matter may be consistent both with locality of the emission process and with the presence of long ranged field ; in this scenario , the adm mass is conserved at the expense of the generation of `` longitudinal '' gravitational waves due to the emission of a baby universe .",
    "the action for the simplest version of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dilaton gravity with conformal matter can be written in the form similar to ref.@xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dilaton field , @xmath4 are matter fields , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a positive coupling constant analogous to the planck mass of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional gravity .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath6 may be absorbed into the dilaton field , but we will not do this for book - keeping purposes . both in infinite space and in the closed ( 1 + 1)-dimensional universe the field equations are simplified in the conformal gauge @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the minkowskian metrics in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions . in this gauge ,",
    "the fields @xmath9 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 obey massless free field equations .",
    "there are also constraints @xmath10 ensuring that the total energy",
    " momentum tensor vanishes .",
    "let us outline some classical solutions in this model .",
    "we begin with the case of infinite one - dimensional space , @xmath11 , and consider localized distributions of matter . in this case",
    "one can further specify the gauge and choose @xmath12 so that the space - time is flat .",
    "equation ( [ 8 * ] ) then determines the dilaton field @xmath3 for a given matter distribution .",
    "indeed , the solution to eq.([8 * ] ) is , up to an arbitrary linear function of coordinates , @xmath13 with @xmath14 hence , the energy  momentum of matter fields produces long ranged dilaton field which has linear behavior at large @xmath15 . in particular , the adm mass can be defined as follows , @xmath16 \\label{9c}\\ ] ] in virtue of eq.([9a ] ) it is equal to @xmath17 where @xmath18\\ ] ] is the energy density of matter which we will often call bare energy density . in the matter action in eq.([8 + ] ) . ]",
    "the dilaton field produced by two lumps of matter of equal energy and opposite momenta , moving towards each other ( or from each other ) with the speed of light , is shown in fig.1 .",
    "needless to say , the linear dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath19 at large @xmath15 is nothing but the coulomb behavior of long ranged field in one - dimensional space . in this respect the dilaton field in (",
    "1 + 1 ) dimensions is analogous to gravitational field of newton s law in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .      for technical reasons , the quantum version of this model",
    "is conveniently formulated in closed one - dimensional space .",
    "so , it is instructive to consider classical solutions in the closed universe",
    ". let us study the classical theory ( [ 8 + ] ) on a circle @xmath20 the absolute length of the circle is irrelevant as we are dealing with scale - invariant action ; what will matter is the relative size of matter distribution to the length of the universe .",
    "the gauge ( [ 9b ] ) is no longer possible in the closed universe ; the closest analog is the gauge in which the universe contracts ( or expands ) homogeneously , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some constant ; our choice of normalization and notation will become clear later . in this gauge , the constraints ( [ 8 * ] ) may again be used to determine the dilaton field for a given distribution of matter , provided the total spatial momentum of matter vanishes , @xmath23 the constraints ( [ 8 * ] ) in the gauge ( [ 9 + ] ) read @xmath24 equation ( [ 10++ ] ) is an immediate consequence of these constraints and the periodicity of the dilaton field in @xmath19 .    for a given matter distribution , the solution to eq.([12a ] ) which is periodic in @xmath19 with period @xmath25",
    "is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and the green function of eq.([12a ] ) obeys the periodicity condition @xmath28 at @xmath29 , @xmath30 we have explicitly @xmath31        \\left ( \\exp \\left[-\\frac{p^{(-)}}{\\gamma}(u - u')\\right ] - 1 \\right ) \\label{10+}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the usual step function .",
    "it is instructive to consider the case @xmath33 ( large `` planck mass '' ) and study two narrow pulses of matter moving left and right and colliding at @xmath34 .",
    "these pulses may be approximated by the delta - function distribution , @xmath35 where the normalization is such that the constant @xmath36 would coincide with the adm mass had the universe infinite size , @xmath37 \\label{13d}\\ ] ] in this case eq.([10 * * ] ) has particularly simple form ( again at @xmath38 ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 when the pulses are close to each other , one has for the total dilaton field at @xmath41 @xmath42 the first term in eq.([14a ] ) describes spatially homogeneous component of the dilaton field , while the second term shows precisely the same coulomb behavior as in the case of infinite space .",
    "in fact , the latter term coincides with the expression ( [ 9a ] ) ( for narrow matter pulses as defined in eq.([13a ] ) ) .",
    "the terms omitted in eq.([14a ] ) are of order of @xmath43 and they become important at @xmath44 ; in particular , they ensure that @xmath45 flattens out and has vanishing spatial derivatives at @xmath46 .",
    "the behavior of the dilaton field generated by narrow pulses of matter , which are close to each other , is schematically shown in fig.2 .",
    "even though the adm mass is , strictly speaking , zero in the closed universe , narrow pulses of matter produce the dilaton field that shows coulomb behavior not far away from the pulses . in this sense",
    "one can still use the notion of bare energy in the gauge ( [ 9 + ] ) .",
    "this bare energy ( the energy of matter ) can be observed by a one - dimensional observer by measuring the dilaton field outside the pulses but at distances small compared to the size of the universe . with these reservations ,",
    "the formula for the adm mass , eq.([9c ] ) , still makes sense ( when all events occur and fields are studied in a small part of the universe ) .",
    "clearly , all these observations apply only to those matter distributions whose conformal size , @xmath47 , is small compared to @xmath25 , the conformal size of the universe .",
    "in other words , we will be interested in considering large wave numbers , @xmath48 the gauge ( [ 9 + ] ) is not the only useful one in the closed universe . at large @xmath6",
    ", one can choose the gauge @xmath49 where prime is used to denote the quantities in this gauge .",
    "in general , the coordinates in the two gauges are not too different , @xmath50 the coordinate transformation has a particularly simple form in the case of two narrow pulses ; it follows from eqs.([13b ] ) and ( [ 14b ] ) that in that case @xmath51 furthermore , for two narrow pulses one obtains ( at @xmath52 ) @xmath53 this expression , of course , solves the constraint ( [ 8 * ] ) for matter distribution @xmath54 the fact that the matter distributions ( [ 13a ] ) and ( [ 17a ] ) are essentially the same in the two gauges , is an immediate consequence of eq.([17b ] ) .",
    "if the pulses of matter are not infinitely narrow , the above features remain valid qualitatively .",
    "the matter distributions in the two gauges ( [ 9 + ] ) and ( [ 12 * ] ) are the same up to corrections of order @xmath55 ; in particular , the spatial sizes of the lumps differ only by a factor @xmath56 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath57 changes rapidly in the regions of non - vanishing energy ",
    "momentum density of matter , and has the form shown in fig.3 , the depth of the well being proportional to the total energy of mater .",
    "we will have to say more about this gauge in section 5 .",
    "the model is quantized exactly in the same way as bosonic string theory in minkowskian target space of @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "one introduces the notation @xmath58",
    "then @xmath61 , @xmath62 are canonically normalized free two - dimensional fields and the classical constraints ( [ 8 * ] ) become @xmath63 where the summation is performed with minkowskian @xmath1-dimensional metrics , @xmath64 and @xmath65 upon quantization , the left- and right - moving components of these fields are decomposed in the usual way , @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the standard oscillator operators with string normalization . according to eq.([2.1 * ] ) , the virasoro operators are @xmath70 @xmath71 and similarly for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "equation ( [ 2.2 * ] ) shows that the model is equivalent to the string with background charge@xcite or , in other words , to the bosonic string in linear dilaton background@xcite @xmath75 with @xmath76 being a light - like vector in @xmath1-dimensional target space .",
    "it is clear from eq.([2.2 * ] ) that the spectrum of states in the target space is the same as the spectrum of the bosonic string in trivial background , @xmath77 the vertex operators are , however , slightly different .",
    "for example , the tachyon vertex operator of conformal dimension ( 1,1 ) is @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "this modification can be understood as being due to the dilaton background ( [ 2.2 + ] ) .",

    "the kinetic and mass terms are conventional , while the trilinear vertex is proportional to @xmath88 , precisely as required by eq.([2.2 * * ] ) .",
    "this argument can be generalized to interactions of the fields other than the tachyon@xcite .",
    "let us now consider highly excited string states ( parent universes ) .",
    "they are conveniently constructed by making use of the ddf operators@xcite . in the light - like dilaton background ,",
    "the simplest choice of the ddf operators is @xmath89           \\partial_{+}x^{i}_{l}(\\sigma_{+})\\ ] ] @xmath90           \\partial_{-}x^{i}_{r}(\\sigma_{- } ) \\label{2.4*}\\ ] ] with the same light - like vector @xmath87 . here",
    "these operators obey the usual oscillator commutational relations , and their commutational relations with the virasoro operators@xcite ensure that the state of the form @xmath92 is a physical state provided that @xmath93 is the physical tachyon state and @xmath94 the ddf operators ( [ 2.4 * ] ) are similar to those introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "another choice of ddf operators in this model has been considered in refs.@xcite .    to make contact with the classical analysis of section 2 , consider suitably modified coherent states @xmath95 here @xmath96 and @xmath97 are @xmath98-number amplitudes and @xmath99 is a projector onto the subspace of vectors obeying @xmath100 this projector is needed to ensure the validity of eq.([2.4+++ ] ) term by term in the expansion of @xmath101 .",
    "let us impose the condition that @xmath102 and take the amplitudes @xmath103 and @xmath104 to be large .",
    "consider now matrix elements of the form @xmath105 and also @xmath106 @xmath107 where the operators @xmath108 are products of matter fields , in general at different points in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time , @xmath109 and , as before , we take @xmath110 , so that the operators @xmath108 indeed contain matter fields only .",
    "the matrix elements ( [ 2.5 * ] ) are then the correlators of matter fields in the coherent state ( [ 2.5 + ] ) , while the matrix elements ( [ + + + + ] ) and ( [ 2.6 + ] ) are the correlators of dilaton and metric fields with matter .",
    "these matrix elements are calculated in appendix with the following result .",
    "up to small corrections and trivial normalization factor , they coincide with classical correlators @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( and similarly for eq.([++++ ] ) ) respectively , where @xmath113 is given by eq.([2.6 * * ] ) with classical matter fields @xmath114 the classical field @xmath115 is defined by @xmath116 while the field @xmath117 is to be found from the classical constraints ( [ 2.1 * ] ) . in short , the matrix elements like eq.([2.5 * ] ) and eq.([2.6 + ] ) are equal to the corresponding classical expressions _ in the gauge _",
    "( [ 12 * ] ) , integrated over translations in one - dimensional space . in this way the classical picture is restored ; the particular choice of the ddf operators , eq.([2.4 * ] ) , corresponds to the gauge choice ( [ 12 * ] ) .",
    "note that eq.([2.5 * * ] ) is precisely the classical constraint @xmath118 written in this gauge .",
    "hence , the ddf operators ( [ 2.4 * ] ) correspond to creation and annihilation of dressed matter excitations in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time _ in the gauge _ @xmath119 .",
    "the corresponding wave numbers are @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively . in what follows we will call ( somewhat loosely ) these excitations as `` dressed particles '' in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional universe .",
    "in this section we consider the simplest ddf state @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the wave function of the center - of - mass motion in target space , in momentum representation .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath125 in eq.([3.1 + ] ) is chosen in such a way that the state @xmath126 has the usual @xmath1-dimensional normalization ( recall the string normalization of the oscillator operators , @xmath127 = n \\delta^{ij}$ ] ) . according to the discussion in section 3 , we interprete this state as the state of a parent universe with two dressed matter particles ( one left - moving and one right - moving ) of equal wave numbers @xmath120 , in the gauge ( [ 12 * ] ) .",
    "the normalization convention in eq.([3.1 + ] ) corresponds to `` two particles in entire one - dimensional space '' normalization of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "these particles have equal bare energies and opposite bare momenta in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , @xmath128 @xmath129 we are interested in the limit ( see eq.([16aa ] ) ) @xmath130 by making superpositions of the states ( [ 3.1 * ] ) with different wave numbers @xmath120 one can construct states with localized distributions of matter in one - dimensional universe .",
    "this generalization is straightforward , so we stick to the state with fixed @xmath120 .",
    "the necessity to consider wave packets ( [ 3.1 * ] ) in target space and not just plane waves ( [ 3.1 + ] ) is due to the dilaton background that increases indefinitely as @xmath131 : amplitudes of processes involving plane waves would be divergent in this background .",
    "it is a matter of simple algebra to see that the total @xmath1-dimensional momentum of the state ( [ 3.1 + ] ) is @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 hence , from @xmath1-dimensional point of view , the state ( [ 3.1 + ] ) is interpreted as an excited string state at the @xmath120-th level with the mass @xmath135 ( recall that @xmath93 is the tachyon state ) .",
    "we consider for definiteness this state in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath136",
    "@xmath137 @xmath138 although our discussion can be straightforwardly generalized to other frames . in terms of the wave packets ( [ 3.1 * ] ) , eq.([3.2 * ] ) means that the wave function of the center - of - mass motion , @xmath139 is peaked near the values determined by eq.([3.2 * ] ) .",
    "the parent universe in the state ( [ 3.1 * ] ) can emit a baby universe  a universe with no or small energy of matter particles .",
    "in @xmath1-dimensional language this process corresponds to the emission of a low lying string state ( tachyon , dilaton , etc . ) into @xmath1-dimensional target space .",
    "let us study whether this process always occurs with non - conservation of bare energy in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "since bare energy coincides with the level of the string , eq.([3.1 * * ] ) , we are interested in the change of the @xmath1-dimensional mass of the highly excited string due to the emission of the low lying string state . at first sight",
    ", the presence of the time - dependent dilaton background in target space might give rise to non - conservation of @xmath1-dimensional energy and momentum in the emission process .",
    "in that case the emission of a low lying state would not necessarily require the change of the level of the heavy string ; in other words , the emission of a baby universe would not necessarily require non - conservation of bare energy in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "surprisingly , we will see in a moment that this is not the case : @xmath1-dimensional energy and momentum are in fact conserved in the presence of _ linear _ dilaton background exactly as they do in flat target space with no background .",
    "hence , the emission of a baby universe always occurs with non - conservation of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional bare energy of matter in the parent universe .",
    "the argument presented below is fairly general ; the particular form of the initial state , eq.([3.1 * ] ) , is unimportant .",
    "non - conservation of energy in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional parent universe due to the emission of baby universes is a generic property of our model .",
    "the argument for the _ conservation _ of @xmath1-dimensional energy  momentum in the presence of the linear dilaton background is conveniently presented by considering a theory of three scalar fields @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 with cubic interaction and exponentially changing coupling .",
    "let the cubic coupling be @xmath143 with real constant @xmath144 .",
    "let us take @xmath140 to be the heaviest ( mass @xmath145 ) , and @xmath141 to have the mass @xmath146 which for simplicity is close to @xmath145 ( but smaller than @xmath145 ) .",
    "let the field @xmath142 be light .",
    "we are interested in the process when a particle @xmath140 emits a particle @xmath142 and becomes a particle @xmath141 .",
    "because of the unboundedness of the coupling ( [ 3.5 * ] ) , it does not make sense to consider plane waves of particles @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "instead , one has to use wave packets .",
    "namely , consider the amplitude of the decay of a wave packet @xmath147 describing the state of the particle @xmath140 into a wave packet @xmath148 of the particle @xmath141 plus a particle @xmath142 which has fixed energy  momentum @xmath149 , @xmath150 we will see in the next subsection that the amplitudes of string decays have similar form .",
    "let us specify the form of the wave packets @xmath151 and @xmath148 .",
    "let us consider for definiteness the non - relativistic regime and take wave packets narrow in momentum representation .",
    "let us furthermore neglect the dispersion of the wave packets with time or @xmath152 .",
    "hence it is difficult to separate the effects of finite widths of the wave packets in momentum space from possible effects of momentum non - conservation . ]",
    "( this can be achieved by confining the particles in moving potential wells ) .",
    "thus , we take @xmath153 where @xmath154 , the width of the packet in momentum space , is small , and @xmath155 is the velocity of the particle , which is also assumed to be small for simplicity . similarly , the wave packet @xmath148 has the form ( [ 3.7 * ] ) with @xmath145 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 substituted by @xmath146 , @xmath152 , @xmath158 .",

    "the only important property of @xmath165 is that it is positive - definite and vanishes iff @xmath166 .",
    "the imaginary part of the exponent , @xmath167 , in eq.([3.8 * ] ) is unimportant and cancels out in the probability",
    ". then the probability factorizes into a term depending on @xmath168 and @xmath169 and a term containing @xmath144 .",
    "the latter term is nothing but the overlap of the initial and final wave packets with the weight @xmath170 . more importantly , since @xmath171 is multiplied by the large factor @xmath172 in the exponent , and because @xmath173 is non - negative and vanishes only at @xmath166 , the exponential factor containing @xmath173 ensures conservation of energy and momentum in the limit of small @xmath154 exactly in the same manner as it does in the case of space - time independent coupling .",
    "the restriction to the non - relativistic case and gaussian wave packets is , in fact , not essential : the same argument goes through for relativistic and non - gaussian wave packets ( provided that they do not disperse with time ) .",
    "the result that energy and momentum are conserved in spite of space - time dependence of the coupling is peculiar to the exponential coupling whose exponent linearly depends on @xmath174 : only in this case the dependences on @xmath175 and @xmath144 factorize .",
    "for instance , if the coupling switches off at infinity in space - time ( say , has finite support ) , then the same calculation leads to the usual result that energy and momentum are not conserved , and the amplitude is proportional to the fourier component of the coupling , @xmath176 .",
    "let us now turn to the actual calculation of the rate of the emission of a baby universe ( low - lying string state ) by a parent universe ( excited string ) in the state ( [ 3.1 * ] ) .",
    "we explicitly consider the emission of a tachyon , although the analysis  and results  are the same for the emission of a dilaton or graviton as the baby universe . let the @xmath1-dimensional momentum of the outgoing tachyon be @xmath149 .",
    "we first have to specify the range of @xmath149 which is of interest for our purposes .",
    "the emission of a baby universe due to the collision of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional particles with wave numbers equal to @xmath120 has a chance to be local if the characteristic conformal time of the process of emission , @xmath177 , is of order @xmath178 this conformal time is related to the @xmath1-dimensional time via @xmath179 the @xmath1-dimensional time characteristic to the tachyon emission can be estimated in the center - of - mass frame of the decaying string as @xmath180 this is the time after which the tachyon is formed and splits off the initial string .",
    "hence we are interested in the tachyon energies of order @xmath181 where we made use of eqs.([3.2 * * ] ) and ( [ 3.2 * ] ) .",
    "since @xmath182 is large , we neglect the tachyon mass where appropriate in what follows .",
    "we are interested in the process in which the initial string at level @xmath120 decays , by emitting a tachyon , into level @xmath183 . according to eqs.([3.2 * * ] ) and",
    "( [ 3.12 * ] ) , and because of energy conservation in @xmath1 dimensions , we have @xmath184 we intend to sum up over all final states at given level @xmath183 .",
    "usually , this summation is conveniently performed by evaluating the forward amplitude shown in fig.4 where curved lines denote the tachyon ( cf .",
    "because of the space - time dependent coupling , the procedure is somewhat tricky in our case . it will be convenient to consider first the amplitude with different momenta , as shown in fig.5 , and set @xmath185 and @xmath186 in the end .",
    "the amplitude is given by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the string coupling constant , @xmath189 is the vertex operator ( [ 2.2 * * ] ) and @xmath190 is the usual string propagator ( recall that the virasoro operators @xmath191 and @xmath72 coincide with conventional ones ) .",

    "this is our principal result : the rate of the emission of baby universes is unsuppressed at large @xmath120 , when the emission process should occur locally .",
    "this emission rate is proportional to the collision rate of two narrow wave packets in one - dimensional universe of conformal size @xmath25 , the proportionality constant being independent of the one - dimensional momenta of the `` particles '' or width of their wave packets and being determined by the string coupling constant only .",
    "let us summarize our results for the simplest version of the dilaton gravity with conformal matter in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "we considered mostly the case of compact one - dimensional universe and studied pulses of matter whose size is small compared to the size of the universe ( i.e. , whose wave numbers @xmath120 are large ) . at least at the classical level these pulses , in the gauge",
    "@xmath251 produce long ranged dilaton field which is approximately coulomb at scales small compared to the size of the universe .",
    "the magnitude of this long ranged field is proportional to the energy of matter , which we called bare energy .",
    "the notion of adm mass makes sense at these scales and coincides with the adm mass defined for infinite space .    to construct quantum states ,",
    "it was convenient to work in a different gauge , @xmath252 it is important that at large @xmath6 , the sizes of matter pulses in the two gauges are similar , again at the classical level . in other words , the pulses that are narrow in the gauge ( [ 4.1 * ] ) are also narrow in the gauge ( [ 4.2 * ] ) , so the processes we were interested in are local in both gauges . making use of the gauge ( [ 4.2 * ] ) , we considered  at the quantum level  the simplest state of the parent universe that contains one left - moving and one right - moving dressed matter `` particles '' with large wave number @xmath120 .",
    "the collisions of these particles may eventually induce the emission of baby universes .",
    "if the relevant quantum numbers of the baby universe ( @xmath1-dimensional momenta @xmath149 of the microscopic string ) are large enough , the emission process is local in the parent universe .",
    "we have found that the emission always occurs with non - conservation of energy of matter , and that the probability of this process is finite at large @xmath120 .    at first sight",
    ", there appears to be a conflict between the locality of the emission of a baby universe , and hence the locality of the non - conservation of matter energy , and the existence , in the gauge ( [ 4.1 * ] ) , of the long ranged dilaton field whose strength is determined by the matter energy . to see that this conflict is only apparent ,",
    "let us present a scenario consistent with both of the above properties .",
    "we stress that the following consideration is only a scenario , as its confirmation or rejection would require the analysis of the final state of the parent universe , which goes well beyond the scope of this paper . also , the discussion below is essentially classical , while the actual analysis should necessarily be at the quantum level .",
    "let us again consider the collision of two narrow pulses of matter , and choose the gauge ( [ 4.2 * ] ) . in this gauge the field",
    "@xmath9 and the matter energy density are those shown in fig.3 and fig.6a .",
    "if the matter energy was conserved , the final state would be characterized by the configuration shown in fig.6b by dashed lines : the field @xmath9 between the pulses would change from @xmath253 to @xmath254 where @xmath255 is determined by the total matter energy in the pulses ( see eqs.([17c ] ) and ( [ 13a ] ) , ( [ 13d ] ) ) . if the energy is not conserved at the moment of the collision ( i.e. , if the collision of the pulses induces splitting off of the baby universe ) , the height of the matter pulses and , correspondingly , the height of the plateau of @xmath9 are smaller in the final state ; this configuration is shown in fig.6b by solid lines .",
    "clearly , the process shown in fig.6 may be perfectlly local in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "it shows that non - conservation of matter energy does not require non - locality .",
    "however , this process _ can not be transformed into the gauge _ ( [ 4.1 * ] ) , as the field @xmath9 does not obey the field equation @xmath256 everywhere in space  time . to see what happens",
    "if the gauge ( [ 4.1 * ] ) is chosen for the _ initial _ state , let us perform the gauge transformation that would transform the `` conventional '' configuraion ( i.e. , the configuration of the conventional process with energy conservation ) into the gauge ( [ 4.1 * ] ) . in the case of infinitely narrow pulses this gauge transformation is the inverse of eq.([17d ] ) .",
    "then the initial state is one shown in fig.2 ( with @xmath257 everywhere ) , while the final state is that shown in fig.7 by solid lines ( only a small region of the universe is presented in fig.7 ; the final configuration of the conventional proccess with energy conservation is again shown by dashed lines for comparison ) .",
    "the final dilaton field @xmath3 in this gauge is the same as that of the conventional process ; in particular , its long range behavior is not affected by energy non - conservation . on the other hand ,",
    "the field @xmath9 in the final state is non - trivial and corresponds to longitudinal gravitational waves .",
    "it is the presence of these longitudinal waves that ensures the validity of the constraints after the collision , even though the energy of matter is not conserved and the dilaton field does not change asymptotically .",
    "of course , the longitudinal @xmath9-wave may be gauged away , but the corresponding gauge transformation would be non - trivial far away from the collision region , and would also induce longitudinal gravitational wave in the initial state .    in infinite space , the gauge ( [ 4.2 * ] ) can not be imposed , so we can not use the arguments based on fig.6",
    ". however , the final states like those shown in fig.7 are still possible in the gauge where @xmath258 initially . for these final states to appear , the field equations should be violated only in a small region of space - time ( where the two pulses collide ) , and the entire process may occur locally . the adm mass viewed from infinite distance",
    "is conserved , but this conservation is due to the appearance of the longitudinal gravitational waves that compensate for non - conservation of matter energy .",
    "it remains to be understood what part , if any , of the discussion of this paper may be relevant to ( 3 + 1)-dimensional theories .",
    "there exist semiclassical arguments , based on the study of fluctuations about@xcite and analytical continuation of@xcite the euclidean wormhole solution of ref.@xcite , favouring the interpretation of the wormhole as describing the process in which a baby universe branches off and then `` flies away '' in ( mini)superspace . this process may be very similar to the one discussed in this paper in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional context .",
    "on the other hand , the possible non  conservation of bare energy was not explicit in the semiclassical treatment of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional euclidean wormholes .",
    "an independent problem which can possibly be treated `` phenomenologically '' , as we did in this section , is whether non - conservation of bare energy in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions is consistent with locality , and , in particular , whether locality requires the generation of longitudinal gravitational waves .",
    "we hope our study of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional toy model will be helpful to understand these problems .",

    "the fact that the state ( [ a.1 * ] ) obeys the constraint @xmath262 follows from the commutational relations of the ddf operators with @xmath191 and @xmath72 , @xmath263 = -\\frac{n}{2 } a_n^i\\ ] ] @xmath264 = \\frac{n}{2 } a_n^i\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath265 .",
    "consider now the norm of these states .",
    "one has @xmath266            { \\langle { \\cal p } ' | { \\cal p } \\rangle}\\ ] ] at large @xmath103 and @xmath104 this is a saddle point integral .",
    "taking into account eq.([2.5 * * ] ) we find that the integrand does not depend on @xmath267 , while the saddle point in @xmath268 is at @xmath269 hence we obtain the usual result @xmath270 up to a pre - exponential factor .",
    "let us turn to the matrix elements ( [ 2.5 * ] ) involving matter fields only and consider explicitly the left - moving sector .",
    "the ddf operators can be written as follows , @xmath271 since @xmath272 and @xmath273 commute with @xmath274 , one can set @xmath275 in the operator @xmath108 for calculating the matrix element ( [ 2.5 * ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath276 commute with @xmath108 and with all factors in eq.([a.2 * ] ) , so one can set them equal to zero and write effectively @xmath277 we have to calculate the matrix element @xmath278 with @xmath279 , which is a building block of eq.([2.5 * ] ) .",
    "note that the operator ordering in eq.([a.3 * ] ) is in fact not essential at large @xmath103 , as is usual in the classical limit .",

    "all dependence on @xmath267 in this integral comes from the exponents in @xmath282 and @xmath283 , see eq.([a.1 + ] ) , and similar exponents for right - moving components .",
    "this makes the matrix element in eq.([a.4 + ] ) equal to @xmath284 .",
    "the integral over @xmath268 is still of saddle point structure with the saddle point ( [ a.2 + ] ) .",
    "hence the expression ( [ a.4 + ] ) simplifies and becomes equal to @xmath285 we conclude that in the leading order in @xmath103 , @xmath104 , the calculation of the matrix elements of the matter operators is reduced to the substitution @xmath286 @xmath287 with subsequent integration over @xmath288 .",
    "this proves the relation between the matrix elements ( [ 2.5 * ] ) and their classical counterparts ( [ 2.7 * ] ) .",
    "let us turn to the matrix elements ( [ 2.6 + ] ) .",
    "since @xmath273 and @xmath276 commute with @xmath108 and with the ddf operators , the operator @xmath289 reduces to @xmath290 when sandwitched as in eq.([2.6 + ] ) . to find the matrix elements involving @xmath291",
