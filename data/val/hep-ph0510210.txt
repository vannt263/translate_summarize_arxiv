    "light - front dynamics ( lfd ) provides a unified framework to analyze various experimental measurements such as generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) and single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) at jlab and desy ( hermes)@xcite , b - decays at slac ( babar ) and kek ( belle)@xcite as well as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) productions at bnl ( rhic ) and cern ( alice)@xcite , etc .. due to the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation , the lfd has distinguished features compared to other forms of hamiltonian dynamics . in particular , the vacuum fluctuations are suppressed and the kinematic generators are proliferated in lfd .",
    "overall , these distinguished features can be regarded as advantageous rather than as disadvantageous in the hadron phenomenology . however , in return , the lfd implies treacherous points , an example of which one may realize from the significance of zero - mode contributions even in the good ( + ) current analyses@xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the common belief of equivalence between the manifestly covariant calculation and the light - front ( lf ) calculation is not always realized@xcite unless treacherous points are well taken care of@xcite .",
    "thus , careful investigations of treacherous points and judicious ways of handling those points should be precedent for lfd to be distinctively useful compared to other forms of hamiltonian dynamics@xcite .    in this presentation",
    ", we discuss a concrete example of a zero - mode contribution found in the standard model analysis of the vector anomaly in cp - even form factors of @xmath0 gauge bosons .",
    "no model dependences are involved in this discussion except that the analysis is made in the standard model .",
    "we then extend our discussion to hadron phenomenology .    in hadron phenomenology ,",
    "observations of zero - mode contribution have been made by many authors@xcite for the electroweak form factors involving a spin-1 particle such as @xmath1 meson or deuteron .",
    "in particular , jaus@xcite proposed a covariant lf approach involving a lightlike four - vector @xmath2 as a variable and developed a way of finding zero - mode contributions to remove spurious amplitudes proportional to @xmath3 , while our method of finding zero - mode contributions is a direct power counting of the longitudinal momentum fraction for the off - diagonal elements in the fock - state expansion of the current matrix@xcite .",
    "however , jaus@xcite and we@xcite do not agree on which form factors receive zero - mode contributions when the vector meson vertex @xmath4 is extended to more phenomenologically accessible ones .",
    "utilizing manifestly covariant models for the vector meson vertex @xmath4 , we find that jaus s method of finding zero - mode contributions has a limitation for the choice of @xmath4@xcite . in the absence of zero - mode contributions ,",
    "the hadron form factors can be obtained by just taking into account only the valence contributions ( or diagonal matrix elements in the lf fock - state expansion ) .",
    "thus , it is quite significant in hadron phenomenology to correctly pin down which form factors receive the zero - mode contribution and which ones do not .    in the next section , section 2 ,",
    "we begin with a brief review on distinguished features of lfd in comparison with other forms of hamiltonian dynamics . in section 3 , we present the zero - mode contribution in standard model analysis of vector anomaly in cp - even form factors of @xmath0 gauge bosons . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss our power - counting method to pin down zero - mode contributions .",
    "conclusions follow in section 5 .",
    "among the three forms of hamiltonian dynamics proposed by dirac in 1949@xcite , i.e. instant ( @xmath5 ) , front ( @xmath6 ) , point ( @xmath7 ) , the dimenson of stability group which leaves the hypersurface of corresponding time invariant is the largest ( i.e. seven out of the ten poincare generators ) in the front form which we call the lfd .",
    "since the number of kinematic operators is maximum among the possible forms of hamiltonian dynamics , to a certain extent lfd is like sweeping dirt to a corner so that it leaves the rest of space clean@xcite .",
    "more reasons for our sweeping analogy may be due to the energy - momentum dispersion relation in lfd is rational ; i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lf energy ( the conjugate variable of the lf time @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the longitudinal lf momentum orthogonal to @xmath12 for the particle with mass @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) . from eq.([dr ] ) , it is very clear that the signs of @xmath15 and @xmath12 are correlated .",
    "thus , for all the particles and antiparticles involved in the physical process , the lf longitudinal momentum can not be negative , i.e .",
    "@xmath16 in the lfd .",
    "this leads to the simplicity of lf vacuum , i.e. the quantum fluctuation of the vacuum is suppressed in lfd , except the zero - mode participation when all the particles and antiparticles in the physical process have zero lf longitudinal momenta , i.e. @xmath17 for all individual constituents .",
    "the simple vacuum except the zero - modes is a remarkable achievement in lfd .",
    "this is indeed like sweeping dirt to a corner@xcite since the complexity of the vacuum is condensed to the zero - mode contribution of the quantum states while the rest of the vacuum is simple . among the various successful applications of lfd utilizing the simplicity of vacuum ,",
    "perhaps the most well - known example may be the parton model in deep inelastic lepton hadron scattering appreciated widely since 1970 s .",
    "however , the apparent simplicity of the lf vacuum yields a difficulty in understanding the novel phenomena associated with nontrivial vacua such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking , higgs mechanism , chiral symmetry breaking , axial anomaly , @xmath18-vacuum , etc .. to understand these phenomena in lfd , we think that it is also very important to look into dirts piled at the corner in our sweeping analogy .",
    "first step in this direction would be to look for the zero - mode contributions in the vacuum phenomena .",
    "realization of axial anomaly in lfd discussed in ref.@xcite was an attempt to this direction . in the next section ( section 3 )",
    ", we discuss an aspect of the vector anomaly in the standard model and present a concrete example of a zero - mode contribution to the vector anomaly .",
    "anomalies betray the true quantal character of a quantized field theory . because they are invariably associated with divergent amplitudes , their evaluation has proven to be complicated , at times even leading to enigmatic results @xcite .",
    "nowadays there exists a vast literature on the subject and perhaps a consensus has been reached @xcite . by definition",
    "an anomaly is a radiative correction that violates a symmetry of the classical lagrangian and usually involves counting infinities whether it is due to ultraviolet infinities or an infinite number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "as this breaking of symmetry may bring quantized theory in agreement with experiment , or , on the contrary spoil the renormalizability of the theory , jackiw @xcite discerns with this distinction in mind two types of infinities : good infinities and bad infinities .    in this presentation , we are concerned with the bad infinities which cause the anomalies that ultimately spoil the predictive power of the theory . in particular , we revisit the vector anomaly which led to the discussions of the requirement of adding a contact term to the magnetic moment and the superconvergence relations @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ , in an effort to rescue the theory long time ago .",

    ", they are completely cancelled due to the zero - sum of the charge factor ( @xmath64 ) in each generation .",
    "since most calculations in the previous literature  @xcite were limited essentially to use the manifestly covariant dimensional regularization method , it has not yet been so clear how the appearance of the vector anomaly changes in lf hamiltonian formulation . in lfd , the wick rotation to euclidean space can never be used and the divergent integrations are given only over the perpendicular components @xmath65 of the integration variable after performing the lf - energy ( @xmath66 pole ) integration in minkowski space .",

    ", one might expect that the non - valence contribution is absent since the integration range for the non - valence amplitude diminishes to zero",

    "the essential results directly related to the vector anomalies in dr2 are summarized as follows : @xmath83    the fact that @xmath84 and @xmath85 disagree indicates that the symptom of vector anomaly in dr2 appears as the violation of the rotation symmetry or the angular momentum conservation ( _ i.e. _ angular condition  @xcite ) .",
    "this appearance is drastically different from the case of the manifestly covariant calculation .",
    "however , the anomaly - free condition ( @xmath86 ) in the sm again removes the difference and restores the rotation symmetry and the angular momentum conservation in lfd .",

    "for hadron phenomenology , jaus  @xcite and we  @xcite independently investigated the spin-1 electroweak form factors in the past few years .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , jaus  @xcite proposed a covariant lf approach involving the lightlike four vector @xmath91 as a variable and developed a way of finding the zero - mode contribution to remove the spurious amplitudes proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "our formulation , however , is intrinsically distinguished from this @xmath92-dependent formulation since it involves neither @xmath3 nor any unphysical form factors .",
    "our method of finding the zero - mode contribution is a direct power - counting of the longitudinal momentum fraction in the @xmath93 limit for the off - diagonal elements in the fock - state expansion of the current matrix@xcite .",
    "since the longitudinal momentum fraction is one of the integration variables in the lf matrix elements ( _ i.e. _ helicity amplitudes ) , our power - counting method is straightforward as far as we know the behaviors of the longitudinal momentum fraction in the integrand .    for a rather simple ( manifestly covariant ) vertex @xmath94 , both jaus and we agree on the absence of zero - mode contributions to the spin-1 electroweak form factors .",
    "however , jaus and we do not agree when @xmath4 is extended to the more phenomenologically accessible ones given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the relative four momenta for the two constituent quarks . although jaus s calculation and our calculation used the same denominator @xmath98 in eq.([eq1 ] ) , they led to different conclusions in the analysis of the zero - mode contribution .",
    "even if @xmath98 is chosen in such a way to get the manifestly covariant @xmath4 , the difference in the conclusions does nt go away .",

    "however , we found that only the matrix element @xmath100 gets a zero - mode contribution so that we can avoid the zero - mode contribution to @xmath101 if we do not use the matrix element @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the weak transition form factors between the pseudoscalar(p ) and vector(v ) mesons , jaus@xcite concluded that the form factor @xmath102[or @xmath103 receives a zero - mode contribution .",
    "we again do not agree with his result but find that @xmath104 is free from the zero - mode contribution if the denominator @xmath98 in eq.([eq1 ] ) contains the term proportional to the lf energy @xmath105 with the power @xmath106 .",
    "the phenomenologically accessible lfqm satisfies this condition @xmath106 .    as we have shown in detail in ref.@xcite",
    ", we can determine the existence / nonexistence of the zero - mode contribution to @xmath104 by counting the factors of the longitudinal momentum fraction .",

    "this power - counting shows that the form factor @xmath104 should not receive a zero - mode contribution in the @xmath110 case .",
    "when the manifestly covariant model for the vector meson vertex @xmath4 is available , we have confirmed that the results found our way coincide with the ones from the manifestly covariant calculation .     for @xmath111 transition in the case of the vector meson vertex with @xmath112 . ]    as we show in fig.[fig1 ] , our result @xmath113(circle ) obtained in the @xmath80 frame ( or drell - yan frame so that @xmath114 ) is in an exact agreement with the full result ( solid line ) in the purely longitudinal @xmath115 frame@xcite .",
    "this agreement assures that our result is correct and there is no zero - mode contribution to @xmath104 for the vertex with @xmath112 .",
    "the nonvalence contributions in the purely longitudinal frame can be found as the difference between the full result and @xmath116 ( dotted line ) or @xmath117 ( dotted - dashed line ) depending on the recoil direction of @xmath118-meson after it decays into @xmath1 and leptons .",
    "comparing jaus s result with ours , however , we find that @xmath113 and @xmath119 differ about 4% at @xmath120 although they coincide at @xmath121 .",
    "this difference between jaus s and ours shows that jaus s conclusion for the existence of zero - mode in @xmath104 does nt apply in this case @xmath122 .",
