    "there is a number of materials with narrow energy band of the electronic spectrum for electrons moving in certain directions .",
    "the narrow band may result either from low - dimensional structure of the crystal or from artificially made periodic superstructure like semiconductor superlattices .",
    "typical examples of low - dimensional crystals are layered materials such as high - tc superconductors , transition metal dichalcogenides like tas@xmath0 , nbse@xmath0 and others @xcite .",
    "such materials can be treated as a stack of conducting layers of atomic thickness , separated by insulating ones @xcite .",
    "narrow electronic bands are typical also for quasi - one - dimensional conductors in directions perpendicular to conducting chains .",
    "for example , the linear chain conductor nbse@xmath1 is a strongly anisotropic crystal with the anisotropy of conductivity @xmath2 in ( b - c ) plane , and @xmath3 in ( a - b ) plane at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "such a strong anisotropy reflects weak inter - chain coupling and narrow electronic bands for electron motion across conducting chains .",
    "this feature of energy spectrum should lead to similarities of the effects observed in low - dimensional materials and in semiconductor superlattices which are thoroughly studied over last few decades @xcite .",
    "interesting effects are expected if electron motion approaches a regime close to the bloch oscillations , when applied voltage is high enough and an electron has enough time to perform several oscillations within the same mini - band until it is scattered , _ i. e. _ , when period of the bloch oscillations is smaller then the momentum scattering time , @xmath4 .",
    "in such a regime dc current decreases with dc voltage increasing , resulting in a region of negative differential conductance ( ndc ) .",
    "this result was predicted theoretically for superlattices by esaki and tsu @xcite , and later was observed repeatedly .",
    "similar conclusions were made for layered conductors @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is no direct experimental confirmation of this effect in low - dimensional conductors .",
    "a possible reason for this is that the crystals were not perfect enough to ensure the band motion of electrons in directions of low conductivity in low - dimensional materials .",
    "however , the strong conductivity maximum at zero bias voltage observed recently in nbse@xmath1 by latyshev _",
    "@xcite argues in favor of possibility of the ndc in such materials .",
    "an important corollary of the ndc is an instability of uniform stationary state in the ndc region which , in principle , may result in generation of high frequency oscillations when the dc voltage gets into the ndc region . the boundary of the ndc region in the static i - v curve is determined by the voltage related to the momentum scattering rate @xmath5 , and the upper frequency limit for the ndc is equal to @xmath5 as well .",
    "the value of @xmath5 in many materials falls into the thz region @xcite,@xcite , so one can expect microwave generation in this frequency range .",
    "however , there is a number of obstacles preventing generation of high frequency oscillations .",
    "the primary one is formation of nonuniform electric field distribution ( field domains ) which impedes high frequency oscillations due to relatively low domain velocity @xcite .",
    "a number of techniques was suggested to overcome this difficulty in superlattices , including application to a sample additional large ac @xcite and using of pulse voltage @xcite , or formation of superlattices with minibands having non - sinusoidal dispersion law @xcite , _",
    "etc_.    in this work we study theoretically a low - dimensional conductor with current flowing in the direction of low conductivity when applied dc voltage falls into the ndc region , and find a uniform oscillatory solution in case when no external time - dependent influence is imposed .",
    "this solution is possible because of interaction of a sample with an environment which we describe by means of an effective antenna impedance .",
    "we found conditions for existence of stable oscillations : the antenna reactance on main oscillation frequency must have the sign corresponding to an inductance , in this case the sample and the effective antenna form an effective oscillatory circuit .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations is determined by the antenna reactance and by material properties of the sample .",
    "oscillation amplitude depends on applied voltage and vanishes at the boundaries of the ndc region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secmaineq ] we derive general expression for the current across the layers . in sec .",
    "[ seccoh ] we study in details the uniform current flow through the sample , derive equations of motion for time - dependent voltage , and find a solution describing oscillations .",
    "we show first the possibility of coherent voltage oscillations using oversimplified but physically transparent model , and then bring strict solution in the form of harmonic series . in sec .",
    "[ secotklik ] we examine response of the system to a small external time - dependent perturbation , and in sec .  [ secstab ] we demonstrate that solution describing coherent voltage oscillations in the sample is stable with respect to small fluctuations . finally , in sec .",
    "[ secdis ] we discuss conditions for experimental realization of the oscillatory regime found in preceding sections and make conclusions .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , electron motion across the layers of perfect enough layered conductor , or between the conducting chains in quasi - one - dimensional conductor can be considered as a motion in narrow conducting band that should have specific features typical for electron motion within the minibands in semiconductor superlattices . in the theory of miniband transport",
    "there are two main limiting cases .",
    "if electron wave functions in adjacent layers are strongly overlapped then an electron has enough time to perform several tunneling processes until it is scattered .",
    "this quasi - classical case of miniband conduction can be well described by means of bolzman equation which holds when @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the miniband width .",
    "if the interlayer hopping integral is small then the sample may be treated as a stack of weakly coupled quantum wells , hence , tunneling processes in adjacent junctions are practically independent , and purely quantum case of sequential tunneling is fulfilled .",
    "an amazing result of supperlattice theory is that in both these limits expressions describing the current as functional of voltage are the same @xcite .",
    "below we show how the similar expression can be derived for a low - dimensional conductors .",
    "for definiteness we will speak about a layered conductor with voltage applied in the stack direction .    for brevity we use units with @xmath8 .",
    "to investigate non - equilibrium transport we use the keldysh technique for green functions @xcite .",
    "current density between layers @xmath9 and @xmath10 may be expressed in terms of the non - diagonal component of green s function both on temporal indices and layer numbers : @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hopping integral for electron tunneling between the adjacent layers , which is supposed to be independent on layer number and electron momentum , and @xmath14 is the retarded ( advanced ) green function , @xmath15 is the dimensionless time , which is mesured in units of @xmath4 . for convenience",
    "we introduce other dimensionless units : frequencies and energies we mesure in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "usually , the hopping integral , @xmath13 , is small and it is possible to construct a perturbation theory , which allows us to express non - diagonal on layer number green functions in terms of diagonal ones . in the first approximation on @xmath13 it reads @xmath16 , and , hence , we get well known expression for the current between the adjacent layers @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 we consider the case when electrons inside the layer are in in the equilibrium while layers are not in the equilibrium with each other .",
    "a difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 leads to deviation @xmath20 of the chemical potential in layer @xmath9 from its equilibrium value , @xmath21 . in this case in each layer the diagonal green function with respect to layer number , @xmath22 , can be related to the retarded and advanced green functions by the expression valid for the equilibrium case : @xmath23 here we take into account temporal uniformity , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the transition to temporal representation we perform according to @xmath25 here @xmath26 is time - dependent scalar electric potential of corresponding layer .",
    "to give proper account to scattering , we use the standard expression for green functions with non - zero momentum relaxation rate @xmath27 here `` @xmath28 '' is related to the retarded ( advanced ) green function , respectively , @xmath29 is the electron energy , counted from the fermi energy , @xmath30 is the component of electron momentum parallel to the layers .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath4 and @xmath31 do not depend on electron momentum .",
    "we concentrate on the case of the same voltage on all junctions , taking the non - uniformity into account only in sec .",
    "[ secstab ] where we study the stability of the uniform solution in respect to small perturbations .",
    "so we assume that deviations , @xmath20 , of the chemical potential from the equilibrium value are small .",
    "finally , the expression for the tunneling current between adjacent layers reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the lattice period in the direction of the current . the second item in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ j1pro ] ) describes the diffusion current , @xmath34 is the voltage between layers @xmath10 and @xmath9 , @xmath35 is conductivity at zero bias and frequency , and @xmath33 is the period of the structure .",
    "consider now limiting forms and simplifications of equation ( [ j1pro ] ) for the current .",
    "we represent the voltage across the layer as a sum @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the average voltage ( here we drop index @xmath9 ) .",
    "when the second time - dependent term is small eq .",
    "( [ j1pro ] ) can be expanded in series with respect to @xmath38 , and we obtain for the current : @xmath39 here we introduce the dc part of the current , @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "further , @xmath42 is the differential conductance , and @xmath43 is the specific tunneling capacity of the sample .",
    "the apostrophe denotes derivative on voltage @xmath37 .    as an illustration ,",
    "consider , first , the simplest case when the applied voltage is time - independent , @xmath44 . then eq .  ( [ jsimpl ] )",
    "results in well - known form @xcite : @xmath45 .",
    "it follows from this expression that the differential conductance becomes negative when @xmath46 .    in case of small harmonic voltage , @xmath47 the expression for",
    "the current in the first approximation in @xmath38 reads @xmath48 from this expression it follows that at high frequencies , @xmath49 , the differential conductivity becomes positive even when the dc bias is in the ndc region .",
    "in this section we derive equation of motion for the voltage and study dynamics of the system when currents in all junctions are identical .",
    "in addition , we neglect voltage fluctuations here , therefore , we do not consider non - equilibrium deviations of chemical potential in different layers and , hence , the diffusion current .",
    "in addition to the tunneling current ( [ j1pro ] ) there are other contributions to the total current .",
    "first , we must take into account the displacement current @xmath50 where we use notation for the specific capacity of the sample @xmath51 .",
    "we must take into account also leakage currents , contributions due to incoherent tunneling , and other processes which are not related to coherent tunneling . to allow for these effects phenomenologically",
    "we add an extra ohmic term to the current : @xmath52 for the i - v curve to have the ndc region conductivity @xmath53 must be small enough : @xmath54    to determine two independent variables , the current and the applied voltage , an additional equation relating the applied voltage to the current in the external to the sample circuit is required .",
    "the equation for current balance which determines the voltage dynamics reads @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the current in the circuit external to the sample .",
    "we consider this circuit as that consisting of a power supply and environment .",
    "coupling of the sample to the environment we describe by means of an effective antenna with the impedance @xmath57 . the equivalent scheme for the system under consideration",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figscheme ] . since typical frequencies of",
    "the problem is high , we assume that ac current does not flow through power supply , so that antenna current @xmath58 is ac and power supply current @xmath59 is dc .",
    "sample dimensions are assumed to be small with respect to radiation wavelength and to the skin - effect length .",
    "this allows us to neglect spatial non - uniformity .",
    "the resulting equation describing dynamics of the voltage oscillations has rather complicated form of the integro - differential equation . in order to find an analytical solution we consider the limit in which the amplitude of the voltage oscillations is small in comparison to the dc voltage , @xmath60",
    "this regime occurs near the boundary of the ndc region or in the case when the ndc region is small .",
    "it is instructive to examine , first , an oversimplified , but physically transparent model , based on assumption that in the frequency range under consideration the effective antenna can be described by the admittance with purely inductive reactive part : @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 is the antenna inductance , and factor @xmath63 is number of layers in the sample , so that the total voltage across the sample is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the real part of the antenna admittance leads to redefinition of the conductivity @xmath53 only , therefore , we drop it here . for convenience",
    "we introduce here a new variable related to the uniform alternating electric field in the sample as @xmath65 , and assume that the ndc region is small , so that contribution of the second harmonic into the friction terms is negligible ( see the next subsection ) . eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) then reads : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is dc current flowing through the sample , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the sample area in the plane perpendicular to the current direction , and @xmath63 is the number of junctions , and we have introduced the total specific capacity of the sample , @xmath70 , and supercriticality , @xmath71 , which changes its sign from `` @xmath72 '' to `` @xmath73 '' across zero when the dc voltage leaves the instability region of the i - v curve .    equation for oscillations ( [ equ ] ) can be treated as a mechanical equation of motion . in this equation @xmath74 plays a role of a coordinate , the last term in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equ ] ) corresponds to a time - dependent alternating friction .",
    "in the regime of stable oscillations the friction averaged over the period must be equal to zero , and its momentary value can be considered perturbatively .",
    "so , in the first approximation we can neglect the friction term , @xmath75 since the phase of the solution is arbitrary , for definiteness , we choose it in the form @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 is an amplitude of electric field oscillations on main frequency , so voltage oscillations amplitude on this frequency is @xmath78 . to ensure that the solution does not increase with time the friction term in ( [ equ ] )",
    "must not contribute at the oscillation frequency @xmath79 .",
    "this condition determines the amplitude of the oscillations @xmath80    guided by mechanical analogy mentioned above , we multiply friction term in eq .  ( [ equ ] ) by @xmath81 and integrate over the period and demand that the work of the friction force over the oscillation period is zero .",
    "the condition of vanishing of the average friction determines the i - v curve : @xmath82 this dynamic i - v curve intersect the static one @xmath83 at three points : at the boundaries of the ndc region and at @xmath84 ( see fig .  [ figvah ] ) .",
    "in this subsection we consider a more general case and determine conditions for existence of the oscillatory solution .",
    "we seek the solution of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) for @xmath38 in the form of harmonic series @xmath85    in the most general case the antenna current reads @xmath86 here @xmath87 , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are resistance and reactance of the antenna at frequency @xmath91 respectively .",
    "solution ( [ sol ] ) has an arbitrary phase which can be determined by initial conditions .",
    "we may fix this phase without any restriction assuming that @xmath92 .",
    "the supercriticality parameter , @xmath93 , we assume to be small at the main oscillation frequency : @xmath94 . as it will be shown later , amplitudes of the @xmath9-th harmonic are proportional to @xmath95 , hence , it is possible to neglect the terms of the order higher than the third one in the small parameter @xmath96 .",
    "so inserting eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) into the expression for the current ( [ j1pro ] ) , and using equation for the current balance ( [ main ] ) , we obtain a system of linear equations for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 : @xmath100 here @xmath101 .",
    "physically reasonable oscillation frequency is determined by the second equation of the system ( [ matrixa ] ) : @xmath102 here we take into account that the contribution of the second harmonic is of the second order in @xmath96 , so that left - hand sinde of this equation should be considered as higher order correction and , hence , should be neglected in main approximation . for oscillation amplitudes",
    "we find @xmath103 @xmath104 this expressions have a transparent physical meaning : if @xmath105 the existence of the oscillatory regime is determined by the sign of the supercriticality , @xmath106",
    ". oscillations are possible , ( _ i_.e . , the amplitude of the first harmonic is real ) only inside of the ndc region .",
    "now we show that @xmath107 is positive under conditions of our assumption that harmonics drop rapidly .",
    "if the ndc region is small then the voltage is close to the center of the ndc region , @xmath108 .",
    "then @xmath109 is small and @xmath107 is positive .",
    "if the ndc region is large then our approach is valid near the boundaries of the ndc region .",
    "near the low - voltage boundary @xmath110 . in this case",
    "@xmath111 , @xmath112 as @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "so if @xmath116 and/or @xmath117 are large enough , then @xmath105 .",
    "the high - voltage boundary of the ndc region corresponds to @xmath118 . in this case",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and two first terms in ( [ eqd ] ) are small in comparison to the last one and , hence , @xmath105 . in other words , in this case the influence of second harmonic on the amplitude of the first one is small , so that @xmath122 , as it was found in the previous subsection .",
    "at the end of this chapter we consider the amplitudes of the higher harmonics .",
    "acting perturbatively , we can express the amplitude of the third harmonic in terms of amplitudes of the first and the second harmonics considering the last ones as an `` external force '' : @xmath123    amplitudes of the higher harmonics , @xmath124 , can be found in the similar perturbative way , and one can see that their amplitudes are proportional to @xmath95 . therefore , the harmonic series ( [ sol ] ) converges and our perturbative approach is valid provided @xmath125 .",
    "thus in this section we have found the solution describing voltage oscillations in the vicinity of ndc region boundaries or for whole ndc region if it is small . beyond the ndc region boundaries",
    "the oscillatory solution does not exist , this is reflected by the imaginary value of the oscillation amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ vs12full ] ) .",
    "amplitude of the oscillations vanishes when the average voltage approaches ndc region boundary .",
    "oscillation frequency is determined by geometry and by material properties of the sample .",
    "this solution exists provided the imaginary part of impedance of the effective antenna has the sign corresponding to inductance .",
    "in this section we determine modification of the i - v curve when the system is exposed to a weak external harmonic radiation of frequency @xmath126 .",
    "again , for simplicity , we treat antenna as an inductance .",
    "let the incident radiation induces voltage oscillations with the amplitude @xmath127 at the antenna output .",
    "then the equation for the oscillating component of the voltage ( [ equ ] ) acquires the form @xmath128 here @xmath129 is the amplitude of the external force .",
    "this equation describes the forced oscillations of the system with single degree of freedom in case of periodic perturbation . as in the previous section we consider the case when the amplitude of the voltage oscillations is small and we solve equation for @xmath130 perturbatively .",
    "when the frequency of the external field , @xmath126 , is close to the eigen frequency , @xmath79 , one can expect the effect of frequency capture .",
    "as in the previous section we consider the case when the amplitude of the voltage oscillations , @xmath131 , is small .",
    "then in the first approximation we seek the solution in the form of harmonic oscillations at the frequency of the external force but with unknown time - independent phase shift @xmath132 : @xmath133 .",

    "for @xmath144 the phases of the solutions are equal to @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the first solution describes voltage oscillations in phase with the driving voltage , the oscillation amplitude being increased by the external perturbation , while the second solution corresponds to the out of phase oscillations with the amplitude decreased by the external force .",

    "this theory gives : @xmath202 here , the dipole resistance @xmath203 is a sum of the radiation resistance related to the antinode of the current , and of the ohmic resistance of the antenna s material , the latter is assumed to be much smaller than the former one .",
    "the radiation resistance is given by expression @xmath204 $ ] ( here @xmath205 is radiation power , @xmath206 is euler constant , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are integral cosine and sine , respectively ) .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ zin ] ) the imaginary part of the antenna impedance is oscillatory function of frequency and on the length of the antenna arms @xmath197 . the dependence of real and imaginary parts of @xmath209 on @xmath197 is presented in fig .",
    "[ figz ] for several sets of antenna parameters .",
    "when the ratio @xmath210 is in the range from 0.5 to 1 , @xmath211 is positive and the oscillatory solution is possible .",
    "to estimate resistivity of the sample , we use conductivity data for nbse@xmath1 adduced in ref . for nbse@xmath1 , @xmath212 , and assume the sample dimensions to be @xmath213@xmath214 with the smallest length in the current direction .",
    "then we obtain @xmath215 .",
    "typical values of @xmath216 for the most interesting case of antenna with relatively large wave impedance which corresponds to high q - value , are of the order of several @xmath217 ( see fig .",
    "[ figz ] ) , hence , the antenna impedance is larger then the sample resistance ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "so conductivities @xmath219 and @xmath220 are small , as it was supposed in previous sections .    for practical applications the higher frequencies are more interesting .",
    "we see several possible ways to increase the oscillation frequency . the first one is to increase @xmath193 by increasing the ratio @xmath221 , either by changing a sample geometry or by increasing the number of layers .",
    "implementation of this idea is limited by the condition for the ndc region to exist ( [ condndc ] ) due to an increase of relative dissipation by antenna caused by radiation as @xmath222 .",
    "another way is to maximize @xmath223 in order to optimize the ratio of the antenna arm length and the wavelength , or to use more complicated antenna , than the simple dipole one . in this case",
    "the limitations are imposed by real part of antenna impedance related to radiation power @xmath224  practically interesting case of larger radiation leads to larger @xmath224 while @xmath225 .    in previous sections we assumed that the current density does not depend on the in - plane coordinate .",
    "in addition to the non - uniformity related to fluctuations of charge density considered in sec .",
    "[ secstab ] , there is another non - uniformity which is related to the skin effect .",
    "so , strictly speaking , our results are applicable provided the sample width is smaller , than the skin - effect length , @xmath226 .",
    "this condition can be easily satisfied in the tera - herz region .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the problem of the current flow through the sample with narrow energy band when the average voltage corresponds to the ndc region .",
    "we have found analytically the stable uniform oscillating solution describing coherent voltage oscillations in the sample . the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations",
    "are determined by dimensions , geometry , and material properties of the sample , and depend on the antenna properties of the system .",
    "the maximum value of the oscillation frequency is limited by the momentum relaxation rate .",
