    "synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring in a variety of physical systems consisting of so - called self - sustained ( or limit - cycle ) oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the key difference between a self - sustained oscillator and a coherently driven system is that the phase of a self - sustained oscillator is not fixed by the phase of the external drive , so it is free to synchronize .",
    "different scenarios of synchronization can be considered .",
    "the simplest setting is a limit - cycle oscillator coupled to an external harmonic drive . with increasing drive strength the frequency of the limit - cycle oscillator is pulled to the frequency of the drive .",
    "if the two frequencies lock together , oscillator and drive have a fixed relative phase . a second possible setting consists of two coupled limit - cycle oscillators .",
    "a third well - studied case is the limit of infinitely many coupled limit - cycle oscillators with random frequencies , for example , the kuramoto model  @xcite showing non - equilibrium phase transitions from unsynchronized to synchronized states .",
    "synchronization in _ classical _ nonlinear dynamical systems has been widely studied and is a well - understood phenomenon .",
    "however , the subject of synchronization in the _ quantum _ regime has been considered only recently  @xcite . in the classical case",
    "the paradigmatic example for a self - sustained oscillator is the van der pol ( vdp ) oscillator .",
    "this is a nonlinear dynamical system with two kinds of damping terms : negative damping which makes the rest position unstable and nonlinear damping which in turn limits the motion of the oscillator to a finite amplitude .",
    "synchronization in the quantum version of the vdp oscillator subject to an external harmonic drive has recently been investigated  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that phase locking  @xcite and frequency entrainment  @xcite survive in the quantum regime , i.e. ,  where the system is close to its quantum ground - state .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous study  @xcite to the case of two coupled quantum vdp oscillators  @xcite where we mainly focus on frequency entrainment .",
    "we use the quantum - mechanical power spectrum to characterize the frequencies of two dissipatively coupled quantum vdp oscillators and find that genuine frequency locking is absent in the quantum regime due to quantum noise . compared to classical ( noiseless )",
    "coupled vdp oscillators the synchronization region is reduced .",
    "we find regions of strong and weak frequency entrainment between the quantum vdp oscillators depending on the coupling strength . for detuned , but otherwise identical limit - cycle oscillators the entrainment behavior as a function of the coupling is different from the entrainment behavior of an externally driven quantum vdp  @xcite . for non - identical quantum vdp",
    "we show that the oscillator with the smaller limit cycle changes its frequency faster in response to the coupling .    a particularly promising architecture to study quantum synchronization are opto- and nanomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "these systems offer the possibility to engineer nonlinearities and dissipation and thus to control their dynamics in the quantum regime .",
