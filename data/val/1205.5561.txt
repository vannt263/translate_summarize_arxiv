    "star clusters have been long considered to host coeval and chemically homogeneous stars @xcite . the traditional paradigm of a striking chemical homogeneity in globular cluster ( gc ) stars is still valid in terms of the iron content , with only two notable exceptions known to date : @xmath5centauri @xcite and terzan 5 @xcite , which are now thought to be the remnants of giant systems instead of genuine gcs . instead , large star - to - star abundance variations in the light elements ( such as c , n , o , na , mg , al",
    "; see @xcite for a review ) and strong anti - correlations ( for example , between na and o , or between mg and al ) have been revealed in the last decade or so by high - resolution spectroscopic studies of main sequence ( ms ) and red giant stars in a large sample of gcs both in the milky way @xcite and in the magellanic clouds @xcite . the scenario generally invoked to explain these inhomogeneities is based on a second generation of stars formed during the first few 100 myr of the cluster life , from intra - cluster medium polluted by the first stellar population .",
    "intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch stars and ms fast rotating massive stars have been proposed as the most likely polluters .",
    "large abundance anomalies have also been observed on the horizontal branch ( hb ) of some gcs : hb stars cooler than @xmath611000 k show abundances consistent with those of giants @xcite whereas for hb stars hotter than @xmath611000 k , departures from the overall cluster abundances are found @xcite . in particular , a deficiency of he and an overabundance ( up to solar and super - solar values ) of elements heavier than ne",
    "have been observed and they have been interpreted in terms of the gravitational settling of he and the radiative levitation of heavy elements ( see @xcite ) , competing with mixing processes ( like rotationally induced meridional circulation , mass loss and turbulent diffusion ) able to moderate the final effects .",
    "moreover , the discontinuity in chemical abundances leads to a discontinuity in strmgren u magnitudes and ( u - y ) colors ( the so - called `` grundahl jump '' , see @xcite ) , where the more metallic hb stars appear to be brighter than the predictions of canonical zahb models .",
    "analogous mechanisms are also invoked to explain the origin of the peculiar chemical patterns observed in population i stars : ms stars of a and f spectral type in some open clusters ( ocs ) @xcite and in the ursa major group @xcite exhibit chemical abundance anomalies similar to those observed in gc hb stars .",
    "in particular , enhancement of iron peak elements has been observed , and large star - to - star scatter has been measured for many other elements , like c , o , na , mn , ca , sc , sr and ba .",
    "chemical anomalies can also be expected for blue straggler stars ( bsss ) .",
    "these objects are brighter and bluer ( hotter ) than the ms turn - off ( to ) , they lie along an extension of the ms in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , and they are thought to be generated by the coalescence of two ms stars via two main channels : mass transfer ( mt ) activity in a binary system @xcite , or stellar collisions ( col ) and merging @xcite .",
    "bsss generated by both channels can coexist within the same cluster @xcite .",
    "anomalies in the surface chemical abundances are predicted for mt - bsss @xcite , since the accreted material should come from the inner region of the donor star where nuclear processing has occured and , in particular , c and o have been depleted .",
    "no significant mixing between the inner core and the outer envelope is expected , instead , in the case of col - bsss .",
    "indeed , c and o depletion has been observed in a sub - sample of bsss in 47  tucanae ( @xcite , hereafter f06 ) , consistently with the predictions of the mt scenario .",
    "accurate high - resolution spectroscopic studies not only revealed the presence of all the chemical anomalies discussed above , but also showed that different stellar populations in gcs and ocs can behave differently also in terms of kinematical properties , in particular in terms of rotation .",
    "in fact , while to and sub - giant branch stars in gcs always show low rotational velocities ( few @xmath7 only ; @xcite ) , a bimodal rotational velocity distribution has been observed for hb stars : the cooler hb stars ( t@xmath811000 k ) have rotations between 10 and 40 @xmath7 ( much faster than old ms stars ) , while hotter hb stars show a markedly different behaviour and rotate at less than 10 @xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . even if the picture is not still completely clear , there are hints that rotational rates and gravitational settling are strictly related and possibly self - powered .",
    "in fact , the high rotation of cool hb objects could be explained by assuming that the progenitor red giant branch stars had rapidly rotating cores and differential rotation in their convective envelopes , and that angular momentum is redistributed from the former to the latter @xcite .",
    "moreover , above a critical value of the equatorial rotational velocity , the meridional circulation could prevent the gravitational settling of he and the radiative levitation of fe - peak elements ( which are already inefficient for these stars ) , thus contributing to explain the lack of chemical anomalies in hb stars with t@xmath811000 k ( see above ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the decrease in rotation rates for hb stars toward higher temperatures is not predicted by the models .",
    "@xcite suggests that it could be interpreted as a result of the gravitational settling , creating a mean molecular weight gradient that inhibits the angular momentum transport in the star .",
    "an alternative scenario to explain the decreasing rotation rates toward higher temperature for the hb stars is provided by @xcite : according to their theory , the radiative levitation of the heavy elements sets a stellar wind that can significantly remove angular momentum .",
    "rotational velocities of a and f stars in ocs are typically lower than 100 - 150 @xmath7 , and , at odds with hb stars , no trend with stellar temperatures or chemical abundances is observed @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour well agrees with the predictions of some models @xcite where the timescales of diffusion processes ( including radiative levitation ) are much shorter than those of rotational mixing .    concerning bsss ,",
    "a rapid rotation is expected in the mt scenario because of the angular momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "high rotational velocities are also expected for col - bsss @xcite , but some magnetic braking or disk locking mechanisms might intervene to significantly decrease the rotation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiencies and timescales of these mechanisms are still unknown , thus preventing a clear prediction of the expected rotational velocities . from an observational point of view , only one bss rotating at @xmath9 100 @xmath7 and no correlation between co - depletion and rotational values have been found in 47 tucanae ( f06 ) . instead",
    ", the largest sample of fast rotating bsss ever observed in a gc has been revealed in m4 by @xcite , ( hereafter l10 ; @xmath10 of the surveyed bsss have rotational velocities larger than 50 @xmath7 ) .",

    "when it was possible , the accuracy of the wavelength calibration has been checked by measuring the position of some telluric emission lines @xcite .",
    "the master sky spectrum , needed to sample the sky contribution , was computed by averaging several spectra of sky regions without bright stellar sources and was subtracted from each exposure .    in order to measure the radial velocities ( rvs ) of our targets ,",
    "we have used the iraf task _ fxcor _ and some tens of fe  i and fe  ii lines , the mg  ii line at @xmath13 4481    and the o  i triplet at @xmath13 7774   .",

    "the h@xmath14 wings mainly suffer from the stark broadening and become less sensitive to temperature variations . according to the photometric determination ,",
    "the majority of the bsss in our sample are hotter than 8000 k , their temperatures ranging from @xmath6 7400 k up to @xmath6 13000 k that is in the range where the sensitivity of the h@xmath14 is reduced . errors in temperatures and gravities were computed by assuming typical uncertainties in magnitude and colors for all the targets ( we conservatively estimate @xmath20v @xmath210.05 mag and @xmath20(v - i)@xmath210.07 mag for to and bsss and @xmath20v @xmath210.02 mag and @xmath20(v - i)@xmath210.028 mag for hb stars ) .",

    "the uncertainty on the @xmath19 determination is substantially negligible ( lower than 0.1 ) for all the targets .",
    "the microturbulent velocity is generally derived spectroscopically , by requiring that weak and strong lines of a given species ( usually fe ) provide the same abundance within the uncertainties . in most of our targets , however , the number of available fe lines is not large enough to permit a direct determination of this parameter .",
    "we therefore used the relation by @xcite to assign a microturbulent velocity value to our hb stars according to their temperature . for the bss sample",

    "finally , we assumed 1.5 @xmath7 as microturbulent velocity for to stars ( according to l10 ) . a conservative error of 1",
    "@xmath7 has been assumed for the microturbulent velocity of bsss and hb , and 0.5 @xmath7 for to stars .",

    "the macroturbulent velocity was assumed to be 0 @xmath7 for bsss and hb stars , whereas for to stars the formula provided by @xcite has been used .",
    "finally , the doppler and the microturbulent velocity broadenings have been computed by using the atmospherical parameters discussed in sect .",

    "we recovered the original values within less than 2 @xmath7 .",
    "uncertainties on rotational velocities are 3 - 4 @xmath7 for to , 1 - 2 @xmath7 for hb and 1 @xmath7 for the bulk of bsss .",

    "iron , magnesium and oxygen abundances have been derived for almost all our targets ( according to the available gratings ) : several tens of fe  i and fe  ii lines , the mg  ii line at 4481   and the o  i triplet at @xmath6 7774   have been used .",
    "chemical abundances have been derived by using both the measured equivalent widths ( ews ) and spectral synthesis through the comparison with synthetic spectra .    in order to calculate abundances for all the elements ,",
    "the set of codes developed by r.l.kurucz @xcite has been used : model atmospheres have been computed by using atlas9 , whereas width9 and synthe have been used to obtain chemical abundances from the measured ews and to compute synthetic spectra , respectively . in particular ,",
    "atlas9 model atmospheres have been computed under the assumption of lte plane - parallel geometry and by adopting the new opacity distribution functions by @xcite , without the inclusion of the _ approximate overshooting _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "atomic data for all the lines are from the most updated version of the kurucz line list by f.castelli . finally , the used reference solar abundances are from @xcite for iron and magnesium , and from @xcite for the oxygen .",
    "the ews of fe  i , fe  ii and o  i were measured with our own code that fits the absorption lines with a gaussian profile ( see l10 and @xcite ) ; the abundance calculation was then performed with the code witdh9 . for the mg  ii line ( an unresolved blending of three close components belonging to the same multiplet ) we derived abundances through a @xmath23 minimization between the observed spectra and a grid of synthetic spectra . only for bss # 1100126 ( the most fast rotating star of the sample )",
    "all the abundances were derived by comparison with synthetic spectra , because the observed line profile significantly deviates from the gaussian approximation .",
    "an important point to recall ( at least for the bsss and hb stars analysed here ) is the possible departure from the lte assumption : in fact , the photospheric layers of hot stars are exposed to the strong uv radiation coming from the stellar interior and this effect is magnified in metal - poor stars because of the low opacity of their photospheres .",
    "the magnitude and the sign of the non - lte corrections are still highly uncertain , due to the incompleteness of the used atom models ( in particular for iron ) and the uncertainties about the collisions rate with the h  i atoms . for the computation of the o abundances we included non - lte corrections taken from the statistical equilibrium calculations of @xcite . instead , for the mg and fe abundances , no grid of non - lte corrections are available in the literature for the range of parameters typical of our targets .",
    "@xcite computed lte and non - lte abundances for some iron transitions in a and f spectral type stars , pointing out that non - lte corrections are relevant for fe  i lines , whereas fe  ii lines are negligibly affected by these effects ( at the level of a few hundredths of dex ) .",
    "thus , in the following we will use the abundances derived from fe  ii lines as proxies of the iron content of bsss and hb stars , in order to minimize the non - lte effects . on the contrary ,",
    "the iron content of to stars is derived from fe  i lines , because these transitions are much more numerous with respect to the fe  ii ones and because the non - lte corrections for these lines should be negligible in dwarf stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) . concerning the magnesium",

    "[ rotfeall ] ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath22 obtained for the bss population in ngc 6397 is qualitatively similar to that found in the other gcs studied so far , namely 47 tuc and m4 ( see fig . 3 in f06 , and fig . 2 in l10 , respectively ; for 47 tuc also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , in these gcs the rotation distribution is peaked at low values ( consistent with the to star velocities ) and shows a long tail toward larger values .",
    "quantitatively , however , significant differences can be recognized , especially in terms of the shape of the distribution , the highest measured values and the percentage of fast rotators . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rotconf ] in fact , the distribution of @xmath22 ( between 0 and 20 - 30 @xmath7 ) is clearly peaked in 47 tuc and m4 , while in ngc 6397 it is more evenly spread .",
    "in addition , while values as high as @xmath41 are found for a few bsss in the two other clusters , the maximum measured value in ngc 6397 is @xmath42 . according to l10 , by defining as `` fast rotators '' the bsss spinning faster than @xmath43 , only 6 - 7% of such stars",
    "are found in ngc 6397 and 47 tuc , while this fraction raises to 40% in m4 .",
    "clearly , the interpretation of such findings is not straightforward and more statistics is needed to explain these differences .",
    "the interpretation is unclear also in terms of the bss formation channels , since conflicting predictions are still provided by the available theoretical models .",
    "in fact , high rotation rates are expected , at least in the early evolutionary stages , for bsss formed by either direct collisions or mass transfer activity in binary systems . however , precise and solid theoretical predictions are still lacking , and possibly some ( poorly constrained ) braking mechanisms likely start to play a role in slowing down these stars during their subsequent evolution .",
    "@xcite predict that a convective zone able to slow down the star develops in the envelope of collisional bsss , while the same phenomenon does not occurr in the models of @xcite .",
    "the latter , instead , predict that a magnetically locked accretion disk forms around the star and is able to remove at least a fraction of the stellar angular momentum . indeed , high rotational velocities could be just a transient phenomenon , characterizing only the early stages of ( some ) bss life ; then the rotation could slow down until those stars become indistinguishable from the bsss generated with low rotational velocities .",
    "such a scenario could partially explain the different fraction of fast rotating bsss observed in 47 tuc , m4 and ngc 6397 .    as for the metallicity , with respect to the to sample ,",
    "the hot populations show a larger dispersion and a trend with the effective temperature ( see figs .",
    "[ levconfgrey ] , [ mgabb ] , [ oxabb ] ) .",
    "such features have been already observed in several gcs for hb stars hotter than @xmath44 k ( @xcite ) and they are explained in terms of particle transport mechanisms ( as radiative levitation and gravitational settling ) occurring in the non - convective atmospheres of these stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "metal enhancements with respect to the initial composition are also observed in population i main sequence stars hotter than @xmath45 k , where the surface convective zone starts to disappear ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although bsss in ngc 6397 belong to a different stellar population ( they are metal - poor , a - f type stars ) , a particle transport mechanism occurring in absence of convection could also explain the observational evidences presented here .",
    "indeed , the observed behaviour of [ fe / h ] and [ mg / h ] as a function of t ( with increasing abundances in the hotter stars ) suggests that element transport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur at a threshold temperature of @xmath46 k. most of the bsss cooler than this temperature shows fe and mg abundances similar to the pristine composition of the cluster ( as derived from the to population ) , while for hotter stars significant metal enhancements are detected .",
    "such a scenario is strengthened by the significant he depletion observed in the hottest bss of our sample .",
    "in fact , because of the gravitational settling , he is progessively diffused downward in the stellar interior , with a consequent reduction of its content on the surface .",
    "since the convection is sustained by the he opacity , the convective zone starts to disappear and the elements with radiative acceleration larger than the gravitational one are diffused upward and enrich the photosphere with metals .",
    "such a mechanism is particularly efficient in absence of stellar rotation , that otherwise would inhibit the metal levitation .",
    "indeed , bss # 1100063 displays the highest temperature , a low rotational velocity and significant he depletion , all concurring to produce its remarkably high fe abundance ( [ fe / h]=0.10 ) .",
    "hence , while no theoretical models of levitation are currently available for stars similar to those analysed here ( i.e. metal - poor , a - f type stars ) , these results and the fact that the onset of chemical anomalies in the bss population occurs at temperatures similar to those predicted for solar abundance ms stars , suggest that bsss behave like normal ms stars of the same spectral type . however , for the hot bsss we also measured a significant enhancement of [ mg / h ] , that is not observed in hb and population i ms stars , likely because of a balance between radiative and gravity accelerations .    while the observed",
    "chemical anomalies prevent us from drawing conclusions about the bss formation mechanisms in this cluster , the present work provided us with the first information about the ( still poorly understood ) particle transport mechanisms in a range of metallicity and stellar mass not covered by other stellar systems . in this respect ,",
    "similar studies of bsss in metal - poor gcs , where the temperature of these stars are high enough for radiative levitation processes to occur , are highly desirable",
