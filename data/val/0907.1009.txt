    "it has been believed for long time that supernova ( sn ) explosions and their remnants ( snrs ) are the places where the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays takes place .",
    "energetic arguments as well as the diffuse shock acceleration mechanism applied to young snrs support this idea . a sn explosion every 30 years is enough to balance the escape losses of cosmic rays in the galaxy . during the past years",
    ", iacts have confirmed that snrs are sources of vhe gamma - rays .",
    "two scenarios can explain the production of the gamma - rays . in the electromagnetic scenario , accelerated electrons",
    "can up - scatter low energy photons through the inverse compton mechanism",
    ". in the hadronic scenario , accelerated nuclei can interact with matter or radiation producing neutral mesons that will decay into gamma - rays .",
    "* magic * ( _ major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov _ ) is a ground based gamma - ray telescope located on the canary island of la palma .",
    "it is a new generation iact with a trigger threshold of 55  gev , and an energy detection range from 60  gev to 10  tev , overlapping with the upper energy threshold of satellites such as fermi .",
    "the design of the magic telescope was a technological challenge which took the existing technology to its limit  @xcite .",
    "one of its main characteristics is its octagonal parabolic reflector of 17  m of diameter resulting in an area of 240  m@xmath0 , capable of obtaining three times more light than a conventional iact of 10  m. for energies above 150  gev , the telescope angular and energy resolutions are @xmath10.1@xmath2 and @xmath125% respectively @xcite . besides this , in april 2007",
    "its data acquisition system was upgraded with multiplexed 2  ghz fadcs which improved the timing resolution of the recorded shower images .",
    "accordingly , the integral sensitivity of magic improved significantly from 2.2% to 1.6% of the crab nebula flux above 270  gev for 50 hours of observation @xcite .",
    "the magic collaboration has finished the construction of a second telescope , magic - ii , similar to magic with improved technology .",
    "located at a distance of eighty five metres from the first telescope , it will be fully operational in the second half of 2009 .",
    "the operation of both telescopes in stereoscopic mode will allow us to improve the spatial resolution and sensitivity of the magic experiment .",
    "during 2007 and 2008 the magic telescope has performed observations of different snrs .",
    "the data include a deep observation of the tycho snr and shorter observations of various radio selected snrs .",
    "the tycho snr is one of the best known and most studied snrs .",
    "it is a shell - type snr ( well defined in radio and x - ray ) which was formed from , most likely , a ia supernova explosion in 1572 .",
    "this young snr is a bright x - ray source with a similar diameter of 8 in both x - rays and radio .",
    "the spatial structure of tycho has been studied by chandra and xmm - newton , providing constraints to the allowed explosion models .",
    "although the age of the snr is known with precision , the distance is not well known .",
    "distance estimates vary between 2.2  kpc  @xcite and 4.4  kpc  @xcite .",
    "most accepted values are in the range 2.3 - 2.8  kpc .",
    "however , recent measurements based on the light echo  @xcite suggest that a larger distance of 3.8  kpc could also be possible .",
    "vhe gamma - ray emission from tycho is predicted by the non linear kinetic theory of cosmic ray acceleration in snrs  @xcite  @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the dominating mechanism for gamma - ray emission is @xmath3 decay rather than inverse compton .",
    "however , spatial correlations in various snrs between hard x - rays and vhe gamma - rays favour the idea that energetic electrons are responsible for the gamma - ray emission  @xcite , @xcite . the detection of vhe gamma - rays from the tycho snr above several tevs would help to clarify the nature of the mechanism responsible for the vhe gamma - ray emission .",
    "tycho has been observed at vhe gamma - rays by the whipple  @xcite telescope and the hegra telescope array  @xcite , however none of them found vhe gamma - ray emission . in the case of hegra , a search for tev gamma - radiation from tycho snr was performed over 2 years ( 1997/98 ) .",
    "no evidence for such emission was found and a @xmath4 level upper limit was estimated : 3.3% crab at 1 tev ( @xmath5ph@xmath6@xmath7s@xmath8 ) .      the green catalog of snrs @xcite contains 265 galactic snrs plus some possible candidates .",
    "it includes information about the flux and spectral index at 1  ghz , summarizing the information scattered over hundreds of publications and catalogs .",
    "this information has been used to select a list of snrs whose parameters are similar to those of 6 well identified snrs that are also known to be vhe gamma - ray emitters : ic443 , rxj0852 - 4622 , rcw86 , rxj1713 - 3946 , w28 and cas a. from the known snrs with vhe emission , we defined the following selection criteria to find targets for our observations :    * * flux at 1 ghz @xmath9 49  jy * * * radio spectral index ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 0.6 * * * distance @xmath12 7  kpc * * * age @xmath12 50000  yr *    from all the sources contained in the green catalog , a total of 37 candidates met the selection criteria",
    ". only 25 of these sources are observable by magic with a zenith angle below 50@xmath2 . from these 25 sources some where removed because they have already been detected in gamma - rays ( crab , ic443 , ... ) , were previously observed ( tycho ) or were covered by the h.e.s.s .",
    "galactic scans .",
    "finally we selected the 9 sources shown in table  [ selection_criteria ] as interesting targets to perform observations with magic .",
    ".parameters of the selected snrs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the skymaps obtained for every source are shown in figure  [ fig : multiskymap ] where no significant point - like gamma - ray excess has been found . for extended sources , the significance is reduced in our observations because of the small trigger area of magic which makes difficult the detection of sources of various tenths of degree . in the case of w51 , the recently reported vhe emission from j1923.0 + 1411 by milagro  @xcite is coincident with an area of higher significance in the rim of the shell ( see figure  [ fig : multiskymap ] ) . h.e.s.s .",
    "reported  @xcite a 3% crab flux from this source which is well below our upper limit ( 9% crab ) . the small observation time ( 7.4  hours ) , the size of the source and its low flux made it not possible to have a significant signal in our observations and only a hint of the source can be seen as the @xmath13 significance area in the skymap .",
    "no significant vhe gamma - ray emission has been found for tycho and the radio selected snrs . in the case of tycho ,",
    "vhe gamma - ray emission is predicted at a level that should have been detected in our observations if the distance is below @xmath14  kpc .",
    "the distance to the snr is still uncertain although most measurements lie below 3.6  kpc .",
    "our result may indicate that the distance could be larger than it is usually believed . in the case of the radio selected snrs",
    ", the computed upper limits range from 5% to 25% crab , assuming a point - like source at the center of the observations .",
    "in addition , the skymaps show no significant ( @xmath15 ) evidence of vhe emission coming from point - like or small size sources located inside the shell of the snrs ."
