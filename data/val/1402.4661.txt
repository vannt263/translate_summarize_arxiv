    "the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is one of the most intriguing quantum phenomena involving the formation of a collective quantum state by a gas of identical non - interacting or weakly - interacting bosons .",
    "below transition temperature , the collective state emerges as a consequence of the fact that a macroscopic fraction of the particles occupy the lowest single - particle energy state . for many decades bec",
    "has remained in the realm of theoretical predictions .",
    "only recently it received an impressive experimental demonstration which , in turn , has stimulated a new wealth of theoretical work .    the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensate was first obtained for weakly - interacting low - temperature atoms in a magnetic trap @xcite proving that bec is a purely quantum phenomenon that can take place even in absence of inter - particle interactions .",
    "more recently , bec has also been reported in solid state quasi - particles systems such as excitons , antiferro and ferromagnetic magnons , even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the collective state emerges if the particle density is sufficiently high and the temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "dimension is also important ; in fact , it is well known that free bosons hopping on translationally invariant networks can not undergo bose - einstein condensation if the space dimension @xmath2 is less than or equal to 2 .",
    "recent studies suggest the possibility that the network topology may act as a catalyst for bose - einstein condensation allowing condensation even if @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of bec has been , in fact , proven , for simple @xmath3 non - translationally invariant networks as comb , star and wheel lattices @xcite , as well as in complex networks as the apollonian one @xcite .",
    "to add more evidence to the catalyst role of topology , we shall investigate in this work the properties of non - interacting bosons hopping on the regularized apollonian network , showing that this topology implies macroscopic occupation of the ground state at low temperatures .",
    "the ran @xcite , as well its original unregularized version ( an ) @xcite , has a complex architecture characterized by a power - law distributed connectivity ( scale free ) and an average minimal path between two nodes smaller than any power of the system size ( small - world effect ) .",
    "these two properties , which are shared by most of real world networks , make apollonian networks an intriguing substrate for statistical models of physical and biological phenomena , as bec @xcite , the spreading of epidemics @xcite , the democratic majority vote @xcite , ising systems @xcite , potts systems @xcite , disk packing @xcite and even gossip spreading @xcite .    in this paper we consider a tight - binding model on the ran , whose hamiltonian has non - vanishing hopping energies only between connected nodes .",
    "the hamiltonian eigenvalues are achieved by a recursive approach for any size of the network .",
    "the regularization of the network is essential since it removes the asymmetry associated to the corners , allowing for exact iterative calculations which can be done only approximatively using an @xcite . in the infinite size limit ,",
    "the density of states and the cumulative distribution of states ( integrated density of states ) are also exactly determined .",
    "the relevant scaling behavior of the cumulative distribution close to the band bottom is shown to be power law , with an exponent depending on the spectral dimension and not on the embedding dimension .",
    "we then consider a gas made by an infinite number of non - interacting bosons each of them described by the tight - binding hamiltonian on the ran and we prove that for sufficiently large bosonic density and sufficiently small temperature a macroscopic fraction of the particles occupy the lowest single - particle energy state forming the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we determine not only the transition temperature as a function of the bosonic density , but also the fraction of condensed particles , the fugacity , the energy and the specific heat for any temperature and bosonic density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the ran model , together with its main properties , including those which differ with respect to an and which are relevant for exact computing . then , in section 3 , we define the tight - binding hamiltonian of the single particle and we exactly compute its eigenvalues for any finite size of the network .",
    "the density of state for the infinite size network , as well as the cumulative distribution of states are computed in section 4 , were we also describe the properties of the cumulative distribution in the relevant region close to the band bottom .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the description of the thermodynamics of a system composed by an infinite number of identical bosons , proving the phase - transition occurrence and finding the transition line in the density / temperature plane .",
    "moreover we determine the fraction of condensed particle , the fugacity , the energy and the specific heat for any temperature and bosonic density .",
    "finally , our main achievements are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the geometrical construction of the regularized apollonian network ( ran ) can be done iteratively by initially taking a @xmath4 generation network with 4 nodes all connected , forming a tetrahedral structure with 6 bonds ( fig . 1 , left picture ) .",
    "each of the 4 triples of nodes individuates a different elementary triangle . at generation",
    "@xmath5 a new node is added inside each of the 4 elementary triangles and it is connected with the surrounding 3 nodes , so that the network has 8 nodes , 18 bonds and 12 elementary triangles ( fig .",
    "1 , right picture ) . then the procedure is iterated at any successive generation inserting new nodes in the last created elementary triangles , and connecting each of them with the three surrounding nodes . as a result , one has the following properties for a network of generation @xmath6 :    * the number of new nodes created at any generation @xmath7 with @xmath8 is @xmath9 ; * the total number of nodes at generation @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "the following asymptotic relations holds for large value of g : the total number of nodes is @xmath12 ; the number of new nodes created at generation @xmath6 is @xmath13 ( the symbol @xmath14 indicates in this paper that the ratio of the two sides tends to 1 , the symbol @xmath15 indicates the weaker statement that the ratio tends to a strictly positive constant , finally , the symbol @xmath16 will be used for generic approximate equalities ) .",
    "the connectivity of a node is defined as the number of connections to other nodes . in @xmath17",
    "the connectivity of each of the already existing nodes ( the so - called old nodes ) is doubled when generation is updated , while the connectivity of the newly created nodes ( the new nodes ) always equals 3 , leading to the following relevant property :    * the connectivity at generation @xmath6 of a node @xmath18 only depends on its age . more explicitly , its connectivity is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the generation at which it was created , and @xmath21 is its age . also , one half of the connections of each old node are with new nodes .",
    "this property , which is crucial for our exact solution via renormalization , is not shared by an . in fact , in an the connectivity depends both on age and geometry since the three nodes at the three external corners have a variant connectivity .",
    "the characterization of the ran can be completed by a description of the connectivity distribution , which can be straightforwardly deduced by the three previously listed properties :    * the number of nodes having connectivity @xmath22 is @xmath23 which equals @xmath24 if @xmath25 with @xmath26 , equals 4 if @xmath27 , and equals @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "accordingly , the cumulative distribution of connectivity @xmath29 is :    * @xmath30 which , for large values of @xmath6 , exhibits a power - law behavior i.e. , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ,    from which the average connectivity can be simply computed and it is @xmath31 , where the approximation holds for large @xmath6 .    the power law cumulative distribution of connectivity @xmath29 is shared with the an as well .",
    "analogously to an , ran is scale - free and , as already mentioned , it displays the small word effect .",
    "has 4 nodes all connected , forming a tetrahedral structure with 6 bonds ( left picture ) .",
    "each of the 4 triples of nodes individuates a different elementary triangle . at generation",
    "@xmath5 a new node is added inside each of the 4 elementary triangles , and it is connected with the surrounding 3 nodes , so that the network has 8 nodes , 18 bonds and 12 elementary triangles ( right picture ) . the procedure is then iterated at any successive generation inserting new nodes in the last created elementary triangles , and connecting each of them with the three surrounding ones . ]",
    "we stress once more that the reason for regularizing is that in ran , at variance with an , the connectivity of the nodes only depends on their age .",
    "the removal of the asymmetry associated to the corners allows for exact iterative calculations , while in an they can be done only approximatively @xcite .",
    "we consider a tight - binding single - particle hamiltonian on the ran network .",
    "each node of the network will be considered as having a single orbital , whose on node energy will be assumed vanishing without loss of generality .",
    "moreover , only directly connected nodes hopping amplitudes are included .",
    "we represent with @xmath32 the state where the particle is localized at node @xmath18 .",
    "then , the hopping amplitudes @xmath33 are non - null only between connected nodes of the network ; as they are real one has @xmath34 .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian assumes the form @xmath35 where the sum goes on all the ( ordered ) connected pairs @xmath36 of nodes of ran of generation @xmath6 .",
    "the most general class of models which comply with the symmetry of ran is achieved assuming that the hopping amplitudes @xmath37 depend on the connectivities of the involved nodes . in other words",
    "@xmath38 . since @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the age of node @xmath18 , in ran ,",
    "the connectivity dependence is the same as age dependence .",
    "this implies that we can also rewrite @xmath41 .",
    "in this work we will assume that the hopping energies are @xmath42 .",
    "the positive parameter @xmath43 is the only relevant microscopic energy scale and , from a computational point of view , it can be chosen without loss of generality equal to 1 ( for @xmath44 , all eigenvalues are simply multiplied by @xmath43 ) .    the off - diagonal hamiltonian elements @xmath33 are inversely proportional to the square root of the product of the connectivity of the two nodes .",
    "this rescaling avoids the divergence of the ground state energy , while keeping the energy bandwidth finite in the infinite size limit of the network ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "rescaling of the microscopic energy scale is commonly used for systems presenting high connectivity as mean - field models or models with long - range connections ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) in order to keep the physical quantities well defined when the size diverges .      in this section",
    "we compute the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath46 for any @xmath6 .",
    "the number of eigenvalues equals the number of nodes and , therefore , it is @xmath47 .    consider a ran of generation @xmath6 on this network and consider an old node ( a node that is not newly created at last generation @xmath6 ) .",
    "let us call this node 0 and let us consider all its @xmath48 connected nodes labeled by @xmath18 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the age of node 0 ) ; the local schrdinger equation centered over node 0 , correspondingly to an eigenvalue @xmath51 , reads @xmath52 where @xmath48 is even and among the @xmath48 connected nodes there are @xmath53 newly created nodes at generation @xmath6 and @xmath53 older nodes .",
    "let us use the even index @xmath54 for the newly created and an odd index @xmath55 for the others .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath53 local schrdinger equations centered over newly created nodes connected to node 0 .",
    "we have @xmath56 where we use the convention @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "assume that @xmath59 .",
    "in this case ( and only in this case ) the @xmath60 can be integrated , i.e. they can be substituted from equation ( [ sgi ] ) into equation ( [ sg0 ] ) . in this way , we obtain an equation which connects node 0 with nodes with an odd index , i.e. an equation which only concerns those @xmath53 older nodes already existing at generation @xmath61 . then , taking into account that all @xmath62 are equal and @xmath63 , and considering also that @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 the above equation , provided that @xmath59 , holds at any of the nodes which were already present at generation @xmath61 and , therefore , it can be compared with the local schrdinger equation centered on node 0 at generation @xmath61 @xmath66 since at generation @xmath61 all connectivities are one half of connectivities of generation @xmath6 , the hopping energies @xmath67 at generation @xmath61 are twice the hopping energies @xmath68 of generation @xmath6 . then the two equations coincide provided that @xmath69 which proves the following : a non vanishing @xmath51 is an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath46 if and only if @xmath70 is an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath71 .",
    "( [ e ] ) can be solved with respect to @xmath51 giving immediately : @xmath72 as we have assumed that @xmath59 , equation ( [ e2 ] ) only gives the non vanishing eigenvalues of generation @xmath6 , once we know the eigenvalues ( vanishing and non vanishing ) of generation @xmath61 .",
    "if there are missing eigenvalues after using ( [ e2 ] ) , they must be vanishing eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the @xmath73 eigenvalues of the generation @xmath6 hamiltonian can be generated applying ( [ e2 ] ) to all @xmath74 eigenvalues of the generation @xmath61 hamiltonian . in this way",
    "@xmath75 eigenvalues are generated but only those which are not vanishing are retained . then vanishing eigenvalues are added in order that the total number is @xmath73 .    since @xmath76 ( the equality only holds when",
    "@xmath5 while for large @xmath6 one has @xmath77 ) , we can simplify as follows :    * equation ( [ e2 ] ) is applied to all @xmath78 eigenvalues of the generation @xmath61 hamiltonian . in this way",
    "@xmath79 eigenvalues are generated and all retained ( including those which are null ) , * @xmath80 vanishing eigenvalues are added in order that the total number is @xmath81 .    when @xmath4 , the ran reduces to four nodes which are all connected so that the connectivity equals 3 for all nodes and all the hopping amplitudes equal @xmath82 .",

    "then , the eigenvalues of @xmath46 can be iteratively obtained applying the rules ( i ) and ( ii ) . since for large @xmath6",
    "the number of vanishing eigenvalues is @xmath85 , about @xmath82 of vanishing are added at any generation updating .",
    "we remark that equation ( [ e2 ] ) maps real numbers in the interval @xmath86 $ ] into real numbers in the same interval . therefore , since the the four eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath87 are in this range , and at any generation only vanishing eigenvalues can be added , the density of states must have a support in @xmath88 . it can be also easily verified that at any generation @xmath89 both a single maximum eigenvalue @xmath90 and a single minimum eigenvalue @xmath91 are present .",
    "we also remark that @xmath92 are always distinct since the argument of the square root in ( [ e2 ] ) never vanishes in the region @xmath88 . on the other hand , reversing ( [ e2 ] ) we have that @xmath93 so that the same @xmath51 can not be associated to two ore more different @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , one vanishing eigenvalue @xmath51 is created by ( [ e2 ] ) from @xmath94 excluding the first iteration from generation @xmath4 to generation @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the number of distinct eigenvalues at generation @xmath4 is 2 and at generation @xmath5 is 4 . in conclusion",
    ", the number @xmath95 of distinct eigenvalues at generation @xmath96 exactly satisfies @xmath97 .    summing up , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the total number of eigenvalues so that the fractal dimension of the support of the density of states is @xmath100 ( @xmath101 is the exponent in the cumulative distribution of connectivity ) .    before concluding this section we would like to stress that analogous calculations were already made in @xcite for an but only approximately or suitably modifying the hamiltonian . on the contrary , all calculations in this section using ran , are exact as well those contained in next sections .",
    "we have seen that for large @xmath6 the number of eigenvalues of generation @xmath61 is about @xmath102 , while the number of eigenvalues of generation @xmath6 is about @xmath103 .",
    "the iterating procedure produces about @xmath104 non - vanishing eigenvalues of generation @xmath6 from the eigenvalues of generation @xmath61 by ( [ iter ] ) .",
    "therefore , about @xmath74 vanishing eigenvalues must be added in order to complete the list of the @xmath105 eigenvalues of generation @xmath6 .    for large @xmath6 ,",
    "the weight of of vanishing eigenvalues is always @xmath82 while , at any iteration of equation ( [ iter ] ) , the weight of any new eigenvalues @xmath51 is @xmath82 of the weight of the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath70 .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to derive the density of states ( [ dos ] ) which holds in the infinite size limit @xmath45 :    * consider the sequence @xmath106 of dichotomous variables @xmath107 and define iteratively @xmath108 ^ 2 + \\frac{8}{3}(2 \\ , \\epsilon(k,\\bar{\\sigma}_{k } ) + 1 ) } \\right ) \\",

    "accordingly , the average energy is @xmath121 where the second equality can be simply demonstrated using iteratively ( [ iter ] ) with the initial condition @xmath109 , which immediately gives @xmath122 for any @xmath22 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of states can be obtained by the integration of the density of states : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the step function ( @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) .",

    "this cumulative distribution depicted in fig . 2 is generated by a @xmath131 network ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the fractal nature of its support is evident , since there are steps of all sizes .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that close to extremes it presents a self - similar structure that will be better described in the following .",
    "let us see more in detail the behavior of the cumulative distribution close to the two extremes @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "let us start by rewriting ( [ idos ] ) as @xmath133 where @xmath134 in the last sum takes the two possible values @xmath135 . using ( [ iter ] )",

    "there are two consequences , the first one being that close to @xmath90 the cumulative distribution is self - similar , the second is that any of the sequence of points must be on a geometrical curve @xmath150 which must satisfy ( [ int+ ] ) , which implies @xmath151 .    when @xmath152 , since all @xmath139 are equal or larger than @xmath153 , one has @xmath154 .",
